How can it be it mapped? What does it do? Why should we be concerned about it? What does it have to with anti-gravity? In my many travels around the worl d in search of lost cities and ancient mysteries I have of ten wondered if there was some link connecting many of the ancient megalithi c sites. Some years ago I discovered that there was no such thing as a coincidence. If the placement of ancient site s was no coincidence, what then was the overall organizing princi ple for the carefully laid out world wide pattern? Are megalithic sites laid out on a grid? What is a grid anyway? According to my la rge and trusty Webster's dictionary, a grid is \" a networ k of uniformly spaced horizontal and perpendicular line, specifically one used for locating points (as on a map, chart or aerial phot ograph) by means of a system of coordinates.\" In other words, we are sp eaking about an intelligent geometric pattern into which, th eoretically, the Earth and its energies are organized--- and possibly in which the ubiquitous ancient megalithic site s are also positioned. What we are speaking of is fundamentally different from longitudinal and latitudinal lines that we are so familiar with from conventional geography. Proponents of the Earth Grid theory suggest that the grid lin es are actually of a more basic nature than the more arbitr ary, later conventions of cartography. However the familiar image of the Earth as a globe girded in a lattice of longitude and latti tude lines helps us understand what an Earth Grid, based on mo re primary energy lines, might be like. I say \"energ y lines\" particularly , because one of the most consistent observations read ers will encounter in this book is that the geometric pattern of the Earth Grid is energetic in nature. And that this Earth energy, organized into a precise web, was once, and can be again, the source of a free and inexhaustible supply of power, once empowering older civilizations of high tehnological achievement. Most Grid theorists state confid ently that this Gr id technology can be reclaimed again---today. While UFOs are a very controversial subject, which may contribute to its perennial popularity, some theorists claim that there is a fundamental rela tion between UFO phenomenon and "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Mapping the World Grid, was popular in the Middle Ages and many techniques are still used by the dowsers of today. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 7 magnetic-vortex-gravity anomalies in the Grid. This subject will be discussed in the book. Furthermore, gravity is as complex a subject as UFOs and the World Grid. Ask your average ma n on the street if he knows what gravity is—-most likely he will say, \"Ofcourse! Everyone knows what gravity is. That's what keeps my feet on the ground!\" Even though gravity is an apparent physical principle defining life on Earth, it is still beyond the understanding of even the most intelligent scientist. No one has yet satisfactorily explained gravity. Is gravity a manifestati on of energy from the Earth, connected with the Grid? If so, can we use certain points on the Grid to master gravity? Are UFOs defying the Earth's gravity field, using some sort of anti-gravity? These are all pressing questions. Perhaps by observing UFO phenomena, we can deduce certain engineering principles in operation in the Grid. Already the Grid seems to implicate two fundamental realities of physical life: gravity and energy. In the pages that follow, you'll be treated to so me of the most advanced and exciting theories on the World Grid. Contributors to this volume a pproach the Grid from diverse professional and phil osophical points of vi ew. The result is a compilation of views (the first, and possibly definitive) of the Grid that spans the poetic to the mathematical. For example, professional anth ropologists Bethe Hagens and William Becker's chapter, \"The Planetary Grid System,\" gives a thorough overview of the geomet ry and geography of a unique World Grid model they call \"EarthStar\". Bruce Cathie, author of four books on the harmonics of the World Grid, presents a fascinating mathematical probe into the Grid incorporating Einstein's Unified Field Theory; Cathie comes up with some most surprising conclusions. Richard LeFlors Clark, Ph.D., discusses gravity vortex areas around the Earth that have been exploited either secretly by governments or by amateur scie ntists for the purposes of levitation and anti -gravity. He warns that you may become \"permanent space debris\" if you wander into one of these areas at the wrong time! Richard Leviton presents the Gr id as a interactive spiritual workshop for the purposes of aligning human with planetary energies through the \"megalithic te mple.\" The Earth Grid is seen as a living hologram of the organization of the solar system, intricately linked with the li fe and destiny of human beings.

He thereby strengthens tahe view of secret governmental research into the areas of anti- gravity and the World Grid. Then Barbara Hero gives a musician's understanding of the Earth in her chapter, \"International Harmony Based Up on A Music Of Planetary Grid Systems.\" Other topics in the book include discussions of the electrical genius Nikola Tesla and the \"Star Wars\" plan, the mysterious Oregon Vortex, acoustic levitation of stones, and more. Nor do we take ourselves so seriously that we can't relax and have a little laugh from time to time. Thus, the back of the book has chapters on anti-gravity patent s, Newspaper He adlines, The Anti-Gravity File and even Comix. What are we to make of all th is seemingly wild conjecture? The reports of our Grid theorist s certainly go against the grain of modern scientific views. And they draw upon information which is often times subjective at best, and certainly controversial. Grid theories ch allenge the very basis of our physical world view. Nor do they all agree with each other. However, major innovations in science often come from seemingly \"crackpot\" speculation. I leave it to the readers to decide which theories fit best into their own reality structure. Personally, now, as I continue traveling around the world, I regard with a more thoughtful eye the complex of ancient temples, cities and mounds. Wh ile I may not agree with, or totally understand, all of the th eories presented in this book, each one has illuminated for me in a special way the reality that the Earth is a unified living plan et, and that we as humans have a special and responsible place with in this total enviroment.

'The experience of life in a finite, limited body is specifically for the purpose of discovering and manifesting supernatural existence within the finite.\" Attributed to Pythagoras Introduction We've entitled our current exercise in planetary grid research A New Synthesis\" — and indeed we hope it is. All that may be new about our work is that we have simply found a unique blend of the previously \"unblended\" ideas of others. Those others are true visionaries in the areas of unexplained earth phenomena, human history, disc overy, and the art-science of geometry (earth measure). Over the last year and six months, we've received literally hundreds of letters from researchers all over the globe — who are seeking a comprehensive explana- tion for a continuum of phenomena and events which traditional science emotionally rejects as \"impossible,\" \"hallucinatory,\" and/or \"unquanitifiable.\" Yet the events continue to be catalogued, with many reports suppressed or labelled \"fraud\" by orthodox scientists. Worldwide networks of questioning theorists persist and grow with ea ch report. We will try to men- tion as many of our correspondents as we can within the text of this article. Severa l contributors, listed at the end. have truly transformed our view of this work. ***** In 1200 A D., a new energy began to move within the cultures of the West. After centuries of obedient reflection within the established order of Roman Chri stianity, the spirit of in- dividualism and exploration be gan to emerge. The 14th cen- tury great plagues of Europe, in which one fourth of the Con- tinental population had di ed — with three out of four persons afflicted, had awakened in the West the archetypal imperative to \"control Nature or die!\" By the 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci and the multi-disciplined geniuses of the Renaissance had rediscovered the lost scientific principles of pre-Christian Greece and Rome, and had invented the \"view point\" of the individual within their perspective drawing and painting systems. Paintings and public murals now began to put the indi vidual at the center of a \"world view\" which, for th e first time in centuries, con- veyed the notion that through individual effort and analysis, the person — the viewer — could come to order and \"control\" the often hostile natural environment. This \"individual point of vi ew\" (perspective view point on \"horizon\") required \"detached awareness\" (standing distant from that which is viewed) and a consummate dedication to visual detail and analysis in order to \"render an in-depth perspec- tive.\" The writing and journalism of today still ring with the Renaissance archetypes. Now it is 500 years later, and Leonardo's manifest symbol of individual view point and detachment has brought us to view- ing video discs of the earth as seen from the moon. It has also brought us to the uneasy conclusion that our pre-Renaissance imperative to control Nature (lit erally \"that which is born\") or die has ushered us into a tec hnological malaise where most of our man-made \"natural\" control systems are in crisis — especially those systems which e xploit, pollute, or dramatical- ly disturb the biospheric processes of the earth. Just as the perspective pictor ial systems of the Renaissance artists \"brought into focus\" the unspoken cultural archetypes of their time, we feel that the current network of planetary grid researchers (of whom we are a part) may be on a similar path toward developing a unifying symbol of a new earth: a paradigm as transcendent over our passing \"Iron Age\" as the Renaissance was over the Dark Ages. What may make the proposition even more fascinating is the parallel analogy that — just as the driv- ing force behind the creative energies of the Renaissance was the rediscovery of Greco-Roman science/philosophy; so with our planetary grid theorists, the driving force behind most research efforts is the continuing flow of evidence, both physical and metaphysical, that the existence of Pre-Egyptian civiliza- tions — some with highly adva nced technologies — is now no longer speculative, but a necessary assumption for developing any comprehensive archaeological treatise.' We believe that the planetary grid is an ancient model that brings control through Illustration #1 These stones on display at the Ashmolean Museum in Ox- ford, England suggest a life of creative intellectual syn- thesis for the Neolithic craftsmen who crafted and \"wrap- ped\" them with leather thongs.

The contemporary video ar- tist/philosopher Dan Winter expresses the idea beautifully. ' 'Our destiny is to encounter our em bracing collective mind with in- creasing intimacy and resonance. We awaken to a love life, in which personal love expands to planetary love — through this touching new body of mindfulness. A new body of mind crystallizes among us.\" 2 Planetary Grid Researchers: Prehistoric to Present The oldest evidence of possible planetary grid research rests within the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford, England. On exhibit are several hand-sized stones of such true geometric proportion and precise carving that they startle the casual viewer. Keith Critchlow, in his book Time Stands Still, gives convincing evidence linking these leather-thonged stone models (see illustra- tion #1) to the Neolithic peoples of Britain — with a conser- vative date of construction at least 1000 years (ca. 1400 B.C.) before Plato described his five Platonic solids in the Timaeus. And yet, here they are — th e octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, and cube all arrayed for comparison and analysis. Other multi-disciplined archaeological researchers like Jeffrey Goodman 3 and A.M. Davie 4 have dated the stone polyhedra to as early as 20,000 B.C. and believe they were used as projectiles or \"bolas\" in hunt ing and warfare. Davie has seen similar stones in northern Scotla nd which he attributes to the early art of \"finishing the form \" of crystalline volcanic rocks which exhibit natural geometry. H e dates these artifacts to at least 12,000 years before Plato (ca. 12,400 B.C.). Critchlow writes, \"What we have are objects cleany indicative of a degree of mathematical ability so far denied to Neolithic man by any archaeologist or mathematical historian.\" In reference to the stones' possible use in designing Neolithic Britain's great stone circles he says, \"The study of the heavens is, after all, a spherical activity, needing an understanding of spherical coor- dinates. If the Neolithic inhabitants of Scotland had constructed Maes Howe (stone circle) before the pyramids were built by ancient Egyptians, why could they not be studying the laws of three-dimensional coordinates? Is it not more than a coincidence that Plato as well as Ptolemy, Kepler, and Al-Ki ndi attributed cosmic significance to these figures.\" Yet another historian, Lucie Lamy, in her new book on the Egyptian system of measure gives proof of the knowledge of these basic geometric solids as early as the Egyptian Old Kingdom, 2500 B.C. We agree, in general, with al l the above researchers that the crafting of sophisticated three-di mensional geometries was well within the capabilities of Pre-Eg yptian civilizations. With the concept that knowledge of these geometries was necessary to the building of stone circles a nd astronomical \"henges\" — we also agree — and would add that we have evidence that sug- gests that these hand-held stones were ' 'planning models,'' not only for charting the heavens and building calendrical monuments, but were also used for meteorological study; to develop and refine terrestrial ma ps for predicting major ley lines of telluric energy; and, in conjunction with stone circles, were used to construct charts and maps for worldwide travel long before the appearan ce of the pyramids. Take another look at the five Neolithic stones. Notice the placement of points on not only completed intersections where hongs connect — but on the ' 'open comers'' where thongs might be added. The central figure, the dodecahedron, has all twelve centers of its pentagonal faces marked with points for further 'wrapping\" — as with the cube figure to the far right. Its cor- ners are defined similarly by marked open points. Now note the tetrahedron, the second figure from the right Its four vertexes or corners, which traditionally define four triangles, have already been bisected by a second array of thongs defining another tetrahedron overlapping the first at midpoints. It is our conten- tion that these stones were not wrapped and marked with leather to facilitate their use as \"bolas\" or projectiles. The stones and their varied nets are too delicate and complex to have been used as hunting and warfare shot. Their appearance struck us initial- ly as ritual objects similar to the decorative reed spheres found in Southeast Asia; or as religious symbols such as the mysterious bronze and gold spheres found in France and Vietnam — which some say depict the ancient text of the Tao Teh Ching. It may well be that all of these hand-he ld objects served similar plan- ning and mnemonic functions fo r the people who treasured and crafted them. (See illustration #2) Illustration #2 Gold and bronze figures exhibiting twelve facets and twen- ty \"horns\" have been unearth ed in France and Vietnam. Vietnamese war veterans recogn ize them as sacred Taoist objects marking acupuncture points. Viewing the stone polyhedra t ogether, we can only conclude as Keith Critchlow does — that their intended use was for the study, comparison, and analysis of spherically determined systems of geometry. Given the apparent use of these stones as \"planning models,\" and given the apparent \"extra wrap\" of thongs on the tetrahedron — c onsider the result if the Neolithic craftsman of these forms had deci ded to discover the ultimate in delineated spherical geometry models, a single sphere upon which would be combined all th e wrappings and points of all five solids. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 31 The most direct route to such a figure is as follows: Take the icosahedron wrapping pattern and combine it with the existing pattern of points and thongs on the dodecahedron. The con- bination of figures provides a form composed of 15 \"great circles\" which intersect at 62 predicted common points. 5 (Sec illustration #3) I Illustration #3 The Neolithic craftsman could easily have created this beautiful polyhedron — which re quires the overlap of a dodec and icosahedron. Fifteen \"great circles\" or \"equators\" of leather thong create the 120 Polyhedron. This figure, which synthesizes the dodecahedron and icosahedron with its 120 triangles, was not only known to the Greeks but to other civilizations much earlier. We believe that its geometry can be applied in two forms: the \"girded sphere\" or marked stone used for mapping, dowsing, or geometry (earth measure); and the armillary sphe re or \"celestial basket\" used as an astronomical device to measure time via the solstices and daily sunrises. The armillary sphere casts a shadow on the cap- tured stone within its framework (see illustration #4) — thus echoing the ancient analogy \"As above, so below.\" 6 Returning to the creation of our ultimate spherical model, the second step would be to take the other figures — cube, tetrahedron, and octahedron — and lay out their line arrays over the existing 62 point pattern. You will find that not only is the 62 point system of vertexes co mpatible with the icosahedron and dodecahedron — but that all the leather thong patterns ot all the polyhedral stones are precisely \"mappable\" over those same 62 vertexes. In fact, our surprised craftsman would soon discover that all five stone ar rays can be overlapped one upon the other with different comer matchings until a beautiful polyhedron with 121 \"great circles\" and 4,862 points has been developed. This is the ultimate single sphere pattern which houses all five Platonic solids wi thin multiple orientations (see illustration #5). This is the same form that was used by R. I Illustration #4 The Minoan archives in Crete catalog the caned granite figure in which our armillary sphere rests as an unknown object. These were of such importance that archaeologists have cast concrete replicas for their restorations at Knossos. Notches in the top of the stand have led some to suggest that these might have been some sort of spit barbeque device. Buckminster Fuller for his domes and in our research, we have called it the Unified Vector Geometry (UVG) 120 Sphere. We consider it the key component in our proposed \"new synthesis\" of planetary grid research. Plato's description in the Timaeus of a cosmology based on the five regular volumes (tet rahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, and dodecahedron) echoes Pythagorean teaching regarding the manifestation of the infinite within the finite. Plato postulates a metaphysics in whic h the four elements of Greek science — earth, air, fire, and water — are associated with four of the five solids. He mysterious ly reserves his description of that most noble form used by the Creator to fabricate the universe as \"a certain fifth composition.\" Tradition relates the cube to earth, tetrahedron with fire, oc tahedron with air, icosahedron with water, and the dodecahed ron with the universe or \"prana/aether.\" Because he had wr itten that, \"The earth viewed from above, resembles a ball sewn together from twelve pieces of skin,\" we believe he related the dodecahedron to Gaia, the living planet earth. We also propose that Plato's mysterious \"fifth composition\" is more complex than the dodecahedron — but based upon it. We sugge st that Plato's most noble framework for building the universe is a form which unifies and supports all the forces operating simultaneously within the five "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"32 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 33 Illustration #6 The world's oldest map, which Richard J. \"Dick\" Ben- son dates to 6018 B.C., depicts the elegant theory of mathematics embodied in the plan ning of the city of Cairo.

We further contend that this sphere is the pattern upon which the ancients built their armillary spheres, which to this day are used to cast shadows for reading the solstices and equinoxes. Contemporary researchers like Donald Cyr 7 and Sir J. Nor- man Lockyer\", experts in archaeoastronomy, have again and again detected in the site lay outs of ancient stone circles and cities, a circular plan of radia ting lines diverging from sacred centers at angles of 22 + , 11 + , 46 + , 90, 120 and 180 degrees. These radiating lines, it was found, consistently align with stand- ing stones, stone circles, and sunrise/solstice marking points on mountain peaks and crest \"notches\" surrounding the site. A related set of angles in the Megalithic landscape, 23 1/2 and 47 degrees, is equally regular but does appear to relate to celestial phenomena of the common variety. In many cases, these and the other angles link one sacred site to another miles distant. The basic triangle in our Unified Vector Geometry (UVG) 120 Sphere exhibits just these angles, at intervals strangely cor- respondent with those found by Lockyer, and Cyr and others. Plato had travelled extensivel y while making notes for the. Timaeus. His visit to Egypt would have brought him in touch with the historian/planners of the city of Cairo. Engineer/geometer Richard J. \"Dick\" Benson' believes that Cairo is possibly the most ancient surviving example of a precise geometric site plan based not only on the angles discovered by Cyr and others but on angles wh ich connect sites across con- tinents and which — again — are almost eerily similar to those in the UVG 120 Sphere. (See illustrations #6, #7) Illustration #7 Donald Cyr is encouraging the use of a simple Halo Sighting Template to be superimposed on maps of ancient sites in order to detect alignments that may indicate \"hid- den halos\" — atmospheric events that were almost cer- tainly a part of the daily life of Megalithic man. This sort of research will require the cooperation of compartmen- talized scientists in astronomy, geology, archaeology, and other disciplines — but may recreate a holistic approach to Gaia that supported the lifestyle of the ancients. Illustration #8 The U.S. Navy has analyzed the Pin Reis map and deter- mined that it is a correct circular grid projection from Cairo. The half diamond (ou tlined by grid points 37, 19, 20 and 38) which contains the complete construction in- fill of the original map shows a superficial, though perhaps indicative, resemblance to two Basic Triangles of the UVG system we propose.

Or was he restricted by a secret vow to the Pythagorean Brotherhood not to reveal to the world the true form of Pythagoras' compound polyhedron, which held all the solids within its form and had been used in the global grid and armillary sphere \"planning models\" for Cairo and other sacred cities? Since Plato, history has lightly sketched what seems to have been a sub rosa quest for a Cairo-centered mapping system, which would \"square the circle\" and/or show the way to the Holy Grail. (Interestingly, a 13th century writer named Wolfram described the Grail as a \"precious stone fallen from heaven\") Curious artifacts like the Pin Reis map, dated 1523 A.D., but believed to be a copy of an ancient Greek original, show \"wind rose\" lines converging on Cairo w ith angular divisions of 22 + and 11 + degrees (see illustration #8). Could this map have been an extension of the site lines a nd solstice/sunrise markers which encircle ancient Cairo? Viewed \"from above,\" the major points on the Piri Reis map so nearly approximate points on our UVG 120 Sphere that we have included a sketch using our geometry and Piri Reis' lines which attempts to complete the missing por- tion of the world map the Admiral originally drew. The Piri Reis map and another unique document, the Buache map of 1737, contribute much toward our contention that early, possibly Pre-Egyptian civiliza tions possessed mathematical, astronomical, and geophysical skills equal to those in this con- fused \"Iron Age.\" Both maps possess highly accurate and uni- que views of the continent of Antarctica not known, supposed- ly, before the International Ge ophysical Year of 1958. (See il- lustration #9) The Piri Reis map was found in Istanbul in 1929 Illustration #9 The Buache Map of 1737 shows Antarctica correctly without its ice cover and may indicate everything from a dramatically different earth climate than today to a technical capacity beyond that generally attributed to human culture 10,000 years ago. The map provides an interesting piece in grid theory: the centers of all UVG 10/12 Pentagons fall at the edges of continents or in oceans. and is said to have been copied from a map originating in the library in ancient Alexandria. The Buache map of 1737 is said also to be the result of copying ancient Greek maps. Both maps astonishingly depict Antarctica's true la nd masses through their icy cover — though instruments to detect such land masses were not invented until 1958. Even if the maps are complete frauds, they still predict Antarctica's tr ue profile thirty years early. The matter of maps which can't exist — but do — is a kind of continuing corollary avenue of research compatible with Unified Vector Geometry. The maps of the so-called mythical continents of Mu and Pan (as described in the channelled Oahspe, A New Bible in the Words of Jehovih; in the writings of controversial scientist/philosopher Sir James Churchward; and in revelations of the Lemurian Brotherhood to the Lemurian Fellowship in Ramona, California) were all made long before the geophysical year studies and the contemporary pioneering ocean cartography of Marie Thar p and Bruce Heezen (see il- lustration #10). Notice the remarkable patterns of mountain ridges running 270 around Hawaii; the flat \"plain\" to the north- east; the boundary through the western quarter of the United States and Canada which marks the division between the Pacific plate and the North American shield. Whether or not these con- tinents existed is a less important question than how accurately the maps mesh with the best co ntemporary scientific knowledge. The correspondence is very close. Returning to the maps of Piri Reis, Buache, and the ancient sea kings, what kind of planning models would an ancient mariner need to construct such maps? Ivan Sanderson, re- searcher into the unexplained, asked such questions in the 1960s and 70s — and with several associates, he set out to \"pattern the mysteries\" by taking full advantage of modern communica- tion technology and statistical data analysis. His success was startling. His 1972 article in Saga magazine, \"The Twelve Devil's Graveyards Around the World,\" plotted ship and plane disappearances worldwide, focusi ng attention on 12 areas, equal- ly spaced over the globe, in which magnetic anomalies and other energy aberrations were linked to a full spectrum of strange physical phenomena (see illustration #11). Highest on Sanderson's statistica l priority list was a lozenge- shaped area east of Miami, in the Bahamas, on the western tip of the infamous Bermuda Triangle. This area's \"high profile\" of strange events, Sanderson concluded, was mostly due to the enormous flow of air/sea traffic in the area. Other zones of anomaly, though less familiar, were equally rich in disap- pearances and space-time shift occurences. A pilot flying with passengers near the Hawaii zone suddenly found himself in a \"dead zone\" without instrument s and unable to communicate beyond the cockpit. After flying some 350 miles, the \"phenomenon\" lifted and the pilot found that tower officials could find no measurable time ha d elapsed between the begin- ning of his \"dead zone\" experience and its end. Another area of continuing di sappearances and mysterious time-warps is the Devil's Sea located east of Japan between Iwo Jima and Marcus Island. Here ev ents have become so sinister that the Japanese government ha s officially designated the area a danger zone. Sanderson theorized that the tremendous hot and cold currents crossing his most active zones might create the electromagnetic gymnastics affecting instruments and vehicles. His theory is now being balanced against several. These same areas, in the pattern of an icosahedron, have been mapped out in the Keys of Enoch (1977) by J. J. Hurtak but"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"38 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID Illustration #11 The lozenge-shaped anomalies of electro-magnetic aber- ration were identified by Ivan Sanderson in the late '60s and were the impetus for a worldwide reinvestigation of practical whole earth geometry.

It is not unreasonable metaphysical theory to assume a pulse to the universe, an electromagnetic heartbeat which makes time appear to go backward and ahead — for planes of existence to manifest and disappear. What better spots for contact than Sanderson's? (See illustration #12) Ivan Sanderson and his energetic colleagues are surely the con- temporary rediscoverers of what has come to be called the \"Planetary Grid\" — so named by Christopher Bird in an arti- cle which appeared in the New Age Journal of May 1975. Bird's writing brought to light that a truly \"morphogenetic\" 10 worldwide research effort, involving earth/human origins and grids, had taken off parallel to and as a result of Sanderson's work. Bird wrote about three Russian researchers (Nikolai Gon- charov, a Muscovite historian; Vyacheslav Morozov, a construc- tion engineer; and Valery Makarov, an electronics specialist) who had published an article entitled \"Is the Earth a Large Crystal?\" Their work, supportive of and following immediate- ly upon Sanderson's, had outlined a worldwide grid of points nearly identical to Sanderson's 12 and had added 50 more. These occured where Sanderson's global icosahedron overlapped the Russians proposed combination of icosa and dodecahedron. These new lines and points, in conjunction with Sanderson's, now matched most of the earth's seismic fracture zones and ocean ridge lines as well as outlined worldwide atmospheric highs and lows, paths of migr atory animals, gravitational anomalies, and even the sites of ancient cities.\" The tradition established by the Russians with the overlapp- ing icosa/dodecahedron grid has be en adopted by almost all grid researchers with the exception of New Zealand' s Captain Bruce Cathie who is working with the cubeoctahedron (Fuller's vec- tor equilibrium model, briefly di scussed in the next section of this article). Among the rest, there are some common themes in the predictive science of the grid and some dramatic divergences. Those involved in what might be thought of as \"classic geometries\" use the mode l to predict physical events and measurable phenomena in the tradition of Ivan Sanderson: Athelstan Spilhaus (faults, seismi c activity, continental drift); J.J. Hurtak (time warps, evidence of paraphysical grid line con- nections among pyramids in the Am ericas); A.M. Davie (coin- cident events). Another branch of theory centers in harmonics. Bruce Cathie is meticulously charting the courses of phenomena grouped under the title of \"UFO.\" Michael Helus has under- taken a universal theory of harmon ics that he calls \"Astrosonics\" and is attempting to develop a practical health technology for people to get \"in tune\" with Gaia by reactivating the harmonics of the cosmic time and place of their birth. He believes that planetary grid harmonics can a nd will be manipulated if we do not develop a responsible stew ardship for this profound and powerful resource. John Sinkiewi cz has developed a theory not unlike that of Donald Cyr — that we may be making an enor- mous mistake if we assume that \"Nature\" is natural, that it's always been like this — with wild climate swings, tornadoes, pole wobble, and the like. Sinkiew icz believes the earth energy grid is out of alignment, is no longer anchored at the north and south poles, and that New Age spiritual communities around the world are gradually rediscov ering the new grid and building their sacred sites in accordance to activate it. Ray Stoner, work- ing with shamans among the Central American and North American Indians, has gone a step further and is searching the museums and ruins for potential pieces of the grid \"power system\" he believes was once in operation around the world and centered in the pyramids. His is potentially the most politically revolutionary theory since so many key \"artifacts\" (such as the unusual stone yoke shown in illustration # 13) are found in the museums and collections of the very wealthy. Illustration #13 Archaeologists hypothesize that \"stone yokes\" such as this one on display at Chica go's Field Museum were worn by Mayan athletes during th eir strenuous and violently competitive games. These yokes measure approximately 24\" by 18\" and are about 4\" in width. They appear to be carved from solid granit e and weigh perhaps several hundred pounds. Ray Stoner has noticed a resemblance to magnets, even down to carvings of heads facing op- posite directions on the two poles. In our opinion, the ob- ject is incomplete, perhaps requiring some sort of attrac- tive base plate.

This same type of work has been carried on in China and Japan for thousands of years as Geomancy — the identification of ar- chetypes of the tiger and the dr agon in the landscape, and the siting of buildings and their functions with respect to balancing these forces with the flow of underground water and cosmic energy. (See illustration #14) A branch of dowsers in this country (including Tom Bearden, Ken MacNeill, Toby Grotz, and Walter Baumgartner) are pushing the politics of grid research into the development of practical \"free energy devices\" that will be decentralized, affordable, and supportive of personal freedom. A New Synthesis: Predictions and Speculations In 1983, upon first seeing a drawing of the Russian planetary grid in Moira Timms' book Prophecies and Predictions, we im- mediately recognized the work of R. Buckminster Fuller — who had spent a lifetime developing his models and theory of \"nature's comprehensive building system.\" There before us, adapted from Chris Bird's artic le, was a drawing of an \"in- complete\" geodesic sphere — in fact, the exact sphere upon which Fuller had based his geod esic domes and much of his theory of synergetic geometry. With the simple addition of 60 lines which connected the vertexes of Sanderson's icosahedron to the vertexes of the added Russian dodecahedron we had duplicated the Neolithic crafts man's model and established Fuller's 15 \"great circle\" polyhedron as a key link in the chain of grid ideas. After locating Bird 's original article and finding the Russian work in Chemistry and Lite, a USSR science Illustration #15 Our goal in producing EarthStar was the creation of a map that would be comfortable to an audience oriented to the equatorial linearity and con tinental positioning of a stan- dard Mercator map. It depict s major river systems, seismic zones, major ocean currents and the lines of the UVG 120 Polyhedron. The map is an excellent tool for distance estimation, as the sides of the Basic Triangle measure 1400, 2200 and 2600 miles respectively. (An interesting numerological coincidence: the sides of the Basic Triangle add up to 6200 miles, or one-quarter of the circumference of the earth). We believe that this map was used by an- cient navigators of the seas and skies, who would have found these great circle routes the most convenient and efficient for long-distance travel. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"40 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID Illustration #16 The UVG 4/30 Diamond centers on EarthStar will pro- vide, we believe, the most fertile zones for research into the ancient history of the earth because they appear to be so geologically stable. In addition, there is a surprisingly full history of advanced cultures in these areas already established: the complex of Alexandria/Cairo/Jerusalem (point 1); a possible nuclear waste storage area postulated by Jalandris in Gabon (point 40): the People of the Four Corners (point 13); the sacred lands of the Hopi (point 17); the sacred lands of the Au stralian aborigines (point 44); the vast complex of megaliths and stone circles in the British Isles (point 11); the extraordinary Ugansk Bay Eskimo art complex (point 9); the ancient splendor of Amazonian cities now buried in vegetation (point 36); the Argentine Tafi megaliths (point 48); the contemporary site of major Soviet defense research (point 5). and the near- ly unmatchable biological splendor of the Galapagos Islands (point 34). magazine, we went into what many researchers, writers and ar- tists call \"curiosity/compulsion syndrome.\" Everything we seemed to hear, see, read, and even eat related \"in some way\" to the planetary grid. Three months after glancing at that Rus- sian drawing, our library had totally changed, cardboard and store-bought globes littered our ta bles, and we were driving to Washington. DC. to meet with Chris Bird. Since that time nearly a year ago, a cascade of information from friends, students, co-resear chers, and others has brought us to this current presentation. We propose that the planetary gr id map outlined by the Rus- sian team Goncharov, Morozov and Makarov is essentially cor- rect, with its overall organization anchored to the north and south axial poles and the Great Pyramid at Gizeh. The Russian map, however, lacks completeness, in our opinion, which can be ac- complished by the overlaying of a complex, icosahedrally- derived, spherical polyhedron developed by R. Buckminster Fuller. In his book Synergetics 2, he called it the \"Composite of Primary and Secondary Icosah edron Great Circle Sets.\" We have shortened that to Unifie d Vector Geometry (UVG) 120 Sphere, because of the form's elegant organization of 121 \"great circles\" running through its 4,862 points. We use the number 120 due to its easy comprehension as a spherical polyhedron with 120 identical triangles — all approximately 30', 60 and 90 in composition. All other forms within our Unified Vector Geometry use shape names and numbers which refer to the quan- tity of smallest UVG Basic Triangles within a given form — and the number of named forms in the UVG 120 Polyhedron or Sphere. Thus, when we refe r to our \"Pac-Man\" pentagons which appeared in our first planetary grid map, you should know that we also call them UVG 10/12 Pentagons, because ten of our Basic Triangles create e ach pentagon and there are twelve pentagons in the UVG 120 Sphere and Polyhedron. In our commercially available EarthStar foldable globe/map, l2 we use the UVG 4/30 Diamond (or rhomb). Within this dia- mond are 4 Basic Triangles, and there are 30 diamonds in the 120 Polyhedron and Sphere (see illustrations #15, #16). This figure permits not only easier assembly of the UVG 120 Polyhedron (in the form of the rhombic triacontahedron) than our pentagon-based hexakis icosah edron, but also permits easy orientation to the four compa ss points when working with the globe or map (see illustration #17, and chart). And now we come to our most fascinating discovery of all — the predictive utilization of the Basic Triangle. It is this figure which we knew to be the result of multiple mappings of all five regular Platonic solids on the surface of a sphere or combined polyhedral form (icosahedron an d dodecahedron) like the hex- akis icosahedron and/or rhombic triacontahedron. What we hadn't known until recently was that R. Buckminster Fuller had not only drawn and analyzed the Basic Triangle, but had also noted all its internal angles in planar and spherical notation (See illustration #18). Also what we hadn't known until quite recently was that this triangle could predict so many kinds of events and geographic patterns, at so many times and places throughout human history. As mnemonic tools, the UVG Basic Triangle and 120 Sphere store and integrate biology, metaphysics, mythology, astronomy, geology, human struggle — or in the words of Pythagoras, \"the supernatural within the finite.\" Illustration #17 (See page 63) The geometry of EarthStar is the rhombic triacontahedron projection method developed by R. Buckminster Fuller.

By noting the three numbers for the Basic UVG Triangle followed by a single number for a minor grid point (example — Oxford, England falls near 2-11-20/2 on our European maps); two numbers for a minor grid line (example — Ita- ly 's boot heel is defined by Basic Triangle 2-1-20/43-28 minor line). * * * * * On September 1, 1983, in the pre-dawn sky, a 747 jumbo jet is cruising over the last island in the Aleutian chain. The Korean pilot is relaxed and having coffee as his autopilot is swit- ched onto \"Red Route 20,\" the standard course set for all airliners out of Anchorage to avoid coming within 25 miles of Russian territories north of Japan. At 3:18 a.m., Japan time, the pilot radios that his position is 115 miles south of Hokkaido Island in northern Japan. Ground radar, however, locates the plane 115 miles north of Hokkaido and well into Soviet airspace. At 3:27 a.m., a garbled distress call goes out from the plane — the last message to be sent from KAL 007. Glance at our illustration of the path of the plane on the UVG 120 Sphere and imagine this scenario. KAL 007 crosses planetary grid point 6, approximately 1800 miles east/southeast of Anchorage, Alaska about 1:00 a.m. Thursday, September 1, 1983. The positions of the sun and moon begin bringing enormous energy into the vector line which stretches from the tip of the Aleutian chain to the Mongolian/Soviet mainland west of Sakhalin Island. (See illustration #19). Silently, wit hout alerting Captain Chun the pilot, the geo-compass in the autopilot's guidance system is slowly pulled 22.24° off its corrected north bearing, altering the course of the plane by that amount while simultaneously begin- ning to energize and speed up the magnetic odometer in the plane's computer navigational sy stem. A fractional addition of a mile is added to each actual mile travelled at an accelerating rate. As the crew and passengers talk about the festivities ahead in Seoul, other smaller aircraft appear behind the 757 airliner. No communication takes place because the pilots of the smaller aircraft are never given interna tional radio freque ncies for fear they will defect. Then an explos ion, and another, thunder into the ears of the crew. Captain Chun begins his radio distress call, but in four short minutes the lives of all 269 aboard are gone. Compare the above to the flight of KAL 902 out of Paris, bound for Anchorage. The date is April 20, 1978. In the pre- dawn sky over grid point 11, in northern Scotland, the 707's guidance system compass begins to read to an energized line running up from the Bermuda Tr iangle. Captain Kim Chang Kyu, a veteran KAL pilot, doesn't notice the bearing of his plane changing slowly to 82.25° off his near polar great circle route. The plane moves onto an infill grid line over Greenland. By the time the plane moves into th e next basic grid triangle, a passenger notices that the Arctic sun which had been on his right is now on his left. Before he can alert Captain Kyu, a Russian missile slams into the fuselage, killing two passengers and for- cing the plane to land on a frozen lake south of Murmansk. As Russion troop vehicles appear on the shore, Captain Kyu apologizes to his passengers sayi ng that he had felt something had gone wrong with his compass before the Russian planes had appeared. Illustration #19 An activation of the grid sy stem appears responsible for the demise of two modem jetliners dependent upon com- puterized navigational system s. On September 1, 1983, KAL 007 left Anchorage (A) on an intended flight to Seoul, South Korea (K). It was diverted down a minor grid line to a crash sight near Sakhalin Island (S). KAL 902 left Paris (P) bound for Anchorage (A) on April 20, 1978 but was diverted down a minor grid line and shot down near Murmansk (M) in the Soviet Union. Both incidents, KAL 007 and KAL 902, were based on pre- dawn crossings of major grid points (6 and 11) by sophisticated aircraft which then, unbeknownst to their crews drifted off their programmed course and followed minor grid lines until shot down by uncommunicative Russian pilots. We predict that there will be other incidents such as these oc- curing in the future, and not just off the Russian coastline. We feel that incidents such as these help pinpoint the evidence about which Ivan Sanderson theorized in 1972 — that there is a predic- table physical pattern of energy events working through the system Chris Bird called the planetary grid. The \"predictable physical pattern\" was discovered in quite a different context from earth energy research. While discussing the physical structures which s upport his theories of geometry (in Synergetics 1 ), R. Buckminster Fuller presented evidence that the micro-photography of balloon skin layers has, under near ideal conditions, produced visi ble patterns id entical to our UVG 120 Sphere surface structure. As interior gas molecules ricochet off the inner surface of the balloon, they manifest their kinetic energy in \"great circle\" patterns of \"shortest distance\" frequency. If the ambient temper ature of the balloon's exterior can be delicately balanced and equalized — the pattern of the UVG 120 sphere can become visible. Given that the earth's origin al formation was based upon the clustered gravitational packing of quadrillions of vibrating cosmic dust particles and gases, in the early eons of our solar system — we feel the analogy of the balloon skin is strongly comparable to the lines of vectorial energy we hypothesize are transitting the earth's surface.

Buckminster Fuller's configur ation of electromagnetic band widths (small sphere) is a hidden master pattern in the UVG 120 Sphere. The similarity to hand-held decorative reed spheres from Southeast Asia is further evidence that such \"planning models\" have been in com- mon use throughout human history. \"If you could only see the reams of tracing paper which spill out of the drawers in my office,\" writes A.M. Davie. \"I have been doing the same exercise with electromagnetic band widths for years. To forecast an event in the Catastrophe Theory, this principle must be used. Whether on a Planetary scale or down to full Earth surface s cale of fractions of inches, it is basically the same theory...I have done experiments (with band widths of frequency tunability) in the lab and found the same experiences as reported in the Bermuda Triangle and UFO incidents. This experiment is too dangerous to repeat, and Edinburgh University has agreed to a ban on all attempts to re-enact the experiments. It is potentially lethal. The th eory of this phenomenon was known to Attistotle...It is definitely TIME-SPACE- COLOUR-HARMONY syndrome in content, and therefore obeys a numerical law of nature to allow forecasting the event.\" a 120th section of these energy lines — and we think that it is totally predictable to find detailed physical manifestations of these lines, particularly on continental land masses. A possible piece of supporting evidence comes from the Vail/Cyr canopy theory — which proposes a more equalized world climate during the Megalithic period (see footnote 7). If the global climatic ambience were more regularized than it is today, it is possible that grid energy manifestations were also more visible and potent ially more available for applied use. Ex- tending the speculation back further in time, the deluge myth round in the myths of virtually al l cultures can perhaps be traced to some (Atlantean?) technological endeavor that caused a par- tial and devastating co llapse of the canopy. Before this collapse, the poles may well have been free of ice (hence the existence of maps such as Piri Reis and Buache). Polar ice caps may have formed relatively rapidly in the period of climatic disequilibrium. In this light, Cyr's Megalithic canopy theory is correspondent with our own findings in analyzi ng Megalithic sites. We have documented in the illustrations of Ireland, Britain, and Europe which follow; a patterned interface of man-made constructions, dating to the Megalithic period, which correspond to our proposed \"infrastructure\" for the icosa/dodecahedral planetary grid. New evidence that we ar e just beginning to analyze 13 , and which includes patterns of mounds within the central United States and the curious \"lines\" of the Nazca area of Peru, ex- hibits the same close correspondence. This proves to us that past cultures have been aware of, and attuned to, the energies of the UVG 120 Sphere. A second analogy to earth's processes we feel comfortable with is the Russian crystal ea rth concept, whereby coalesced volcanic matter which formed the earth settled initially into a crystal for (UVG 120 Polyhedron) . The Russians th eorize that with rotation and centrifugal re distribution of molten surface material, the earth soon took on its spherical form but retains the deep crystal structure and its predictable manifestations. One of these is based on the principle that crystal edges and vertexes carry most of the thermal, structural, and electromagnetic energy events developing from within and imposed upon the surface material. Satellite cameras and in frared/radar intruments have already documented thermal/structural energy developments along the globe's UVG 120 Polyhedral edges. It remains for traditional science to develop instruments as sensitive as an ex- perienced dowser's \"earth sense\" before the full spectrum of the earth's electromagnetism can be tuned like a \"crystal set\" radio to a wide range of frequency band widths. (See illustra- tion #20) It is clear to us that Megalithic peoples knew all that we now know about the planetary grid an d then some. The stones which they so carefully placed upon ley lines were used to communicate with anyone else linked via common telluric energy flows. (See illustration #21) These energy flows are being mapped today Illustration #21 Unobstructed minor grid energy lines focus into a Basic Triangle corner in the Britis h Isles, which have probably the largest clustering of megaliths in northern Europe. Stone circles are indicated by dots. Illustration #22 Both ley line hunters and dowsers have wondered at the persistent site line-ups of ancient megaliths and more re- cent sacred constructions (cathedrals, capital cities, shrines, etc.). The diamond-pattern line superimposed on our map shows a transcontinental system of energy ley lines published by Golin Bloy an experienced dowser in Europe. Most of the line has been confirmed by dows- ing. The correspondence with the UVG 120 Sphere is ap- parent. In Triangle 11-20-2, we find Oxford (2); North Sea oil deposits (4-5-6); Rotte rdam (9); Hameln, village of the Pied Piper (17); Berlin (13); Chartres (17); Alta Mira (24); Frankfort (19); Barcelona (35); Cordoba (32); Hamburg (12); and Lourdes (line 24-36).

(See illustra- tion #22) We also hold that a major reason why Megalithic groups were so interested in astronomy and the precise calculation of solar and lunar phases was that within these calculations rested the predicted \"pulses\" of energy through the grid at different times of the year. Captain Bruce Cathie , an airline pilot and prolific grid researcher from New Zealand, has theorized for years regar- ding the grid's pulsing harmonic pa ttern and how it might relate to UFO and \"sky light\" phenomena. UVG is applicable to this research in a curious way. R. Buckminster Fuller was constantly experimenting with spherical p acking — how many equal sized spheres can you fit into a given polyhedron, and how can the arrangement be shifted (keeping the same number of spheres) into a different one. As it happens, the UVG 120 Polyhedron shifts back and forth with the cubeoctahedron (or vector equilibrium model, as Fuller calls it) that Cathie uses and that seems to map UFO phenomena. We can hypothesize the heart- beat of Gaia. The ancients evidently patterned their universal and local holidays and feasts to conjoin w ith the interlocking events be- tween the grid and solar system energy fields. Both KAL 007 and KAL 902 tragedies occurred during significant holiday periods — 007 during a major Hindu feast for Vishnu, and 902 during Good Friday/Passover. We have also come to speculate that the stone polyhedra introduced early in this article may have been used as charts and terrestrial guides for large pilgrimages which took place over major regi ons of the globe. (See illustra- tion #23) Spiritually and intellectually hungry travellers may well have visited major energy collection points on the grid, each having its own flavor and delight.

Cyr's notion is that much can be gained in understanding past civilizations if we do not make the uniformitarian assumption that things (such as climate) have always been roughly as they are now. The Vail/Cyr \"Canopy Theory' supposes that during the Megalithic period, a layer of ice crystals formed over the earth at a height of about fifty miles. This could have produced something like the greenhouse effect — a mild, relatively windless climate with the atmosphere at the dew point — over much of the earth, with spec- tacular halos around the sun and moon. The light of the sun shining through the ice crystals would have been so brilliant that it would have been im- possible to gaze at it directly. Because of the optics of tight refraction through the ice crystals, however, eac h halo edge would fall 22 degrees from the center of the sun — with a less common, but equally regular secondary halo occuring 46 + degrees from the center. This glorious sky phenomenon could have given man the world over a predictable common unit of measure. A related effect of the canopy may also help explain the seemingly phenomenal knowledge of as tronomy among the ancients. Joe Jochmans (writing as Jalandris) receiv ed an honorary doctorate for his in- terpretation of Genesis based upon canopy and other earth energy effects. He claims that the canopy may have magnified the l i g h t from the stars and planets and made them appear closer and much easier to view with the unaided eye than is possible today. His other fascinating theory is that the Megalithic canopy was preceded by an even larger more magnificent canopy that ultimately collapsed — producing the great deluge and rain of forty days and forty nights that is recorded in the sacred tradition of virtually every culture on earth. 8.

Norman Lockyer, writing in the early part of this century, was perhaps the first contemporary archaeoastronomer — having discovered signifi- cant alignments between megaliths and celestial bodies. His work was largely rejected, as were his very humanitarian politics that echo his British predecessor Alfred Russel Wallace, though it forms the base for later work reinitiated by Alexander Thorn. 9. Dick Benson's work, formally presented in June of this year to the U.S. Psychotronics Association meeting in At lanta, holds the promise of a unified field of letters and numbers. His \"World 's Oldest Jesus 0 Map\" is reprinted to give not only a glimpse of the complex geometry employed by the an- cient planners at Cairo but to hint at the sophistication and refinement of Benson's work. One of his most exciting archaeological discoveries is a virtually identical \"site plan\" based on the pyramids at Teotihuacan in Mexico. 10. \"Morphogenetic fields\" were introduced by British biologist Rupert Sheldrake in anothe r controversial book, A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Formative Causation, suggested for burning by Nature magazine in Britain. The theory is complex, implying that once something comes into existence (an idea, a gene code, a chemical structure...) it ex- clusively fills a specific cosmic niche, sends a kind of formative energy throughout Gaia; and makes its appearance quickly and with increasing ease throughout the world. Currently the Tarrytown Group in New York is offering a prize of $10,000 for the best experimental design to test Sheldrake's theory. 11. Over the past year and a half, students in anthopology and environmental planning at Governors State University have undertaken the tedious, not- yet-computer assisted task of checking the fantastic claims of the Russian visionaries. (Several students, among them Penny Fnck, Tim Donovan. Jay Rick, Denis Chapman. John Lerch, and Mary BoyaJean. have put in far beyond the required time and effort and have been brave enough to criticize and question almost everything!) In general, the students' work has involved the translation of data from various atlases and sourcebooks from their Mercator, conical and spherical projections to the hexakis icosahedron and rhombic triacontahedron that we use for standardizing data. For the most part, the Russian claims hold up but are substantially over-generalized — particularly with respect to electromagnetic aberration. 12.

The pyramids and ley lines are on the power transfer lines of the natural Earth gravity Grid all over the world. The Earth Grid is comprised of the geometrical flow lines of gravity energy in the structure of the Earth itself. While the subject of the Earth Grid has by now been covered in a considerable number of publications, one point in the Grid, marked by a long and strange history, at the eastern tip of Lake Ontario, is worth special mention. Most interesting here are two individuals, living one hundred years apart, who were both directly affected by this same Earth Grid point. These men were Daniel Home, the 19th century psychic, and Wilbert Smith, the 20th century scientist. Daniel Home is the world famous levitator of the 19th century who lived in this Lake Ontario Grid point area. The period from 1820 to 1850 was apparently very active for this Grid point as many of the crowned heads of Europe and many noted scientists and world dignitaries visited Home and verified his feats of levitation. It is speculated that the Lake Ontario region may have acted as a biolectric triggering device conducive to Home's psychic development.

This has been the only known official governmental research program into the Earth Grid system. A considerable number of planes and ships had mysteriously vanished from this region, while many UFO sightings were reported, and other bizarre and unearthly phenomena were noted. (For more information, refer to Hugh Cochrane's Gateway to Oblivion, Avon Books, NY) Wilbert Smith, a Canadian communications engineer in the Department of Transportation, was director of the team of scientists involved in this pr oject. Project Magnet was later officially terminated when the results became too sensitive for the two governments, as the research seemed to touch upon top secret UFO data. Afterwards Wilbert Smith designed several inexpensive gravity devices, such as the Anti-Gravity Proximity Detector, the Magnetic Deflection Detector, and the EMF Collapse Collector. Smith's speculations are most intriguing. He noted large and sometimes mobile gravity anomalies all over the Lake Ontario area. He noted areas of \"reduced binding\" in the atmosphere above the Lake; the areas were described as \"pillar-like columns\" a thousand feet across and extending for several thousand feet up into the atmosphere. Moreover, they were invisible and only detect able with sensitive equipment. Peculiarities in gravity and magnetism were noted inside these columns, possibly related to a reduction (or weakening) in the nuclear binding forces holding matter together; the nuclear binding forces seemed stronger in the north and weaker in the south. Some of these mysterious columns appeared to be mobile changing location over time. Smith theorized that when the weakened nuclear binding forces encountered matter under stress (such as an airplane in flight) the forces holding matter together ceased to exist, exactly along the lines of maximum stress, and the material disintegrated resulting in aircraft disasters. Later theorists suggested that ionization of the air within these columns could generate luminous anomalies, and that increasing energies could make rocks and other dielectrics in the immediate area appear to rise from the ground into the air. It was also proposed that deep Earth-caused gravity stresses produced the strange atmospheric columns. In a gravity-structured Earth which is part of a gravity universe, "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 55 that is the mildest form of truthful statement possible. On a planet so determined by gravity, this would be only one of many such gravity-magnetic anomalies present on the Earth Grid. And underlying many of the magnetic peculiarities observed around the Earth is the special principle of diamagnetism, the root of anti-gravity. First we'll see this principle at work in the local context of human-induced levitation. HUMAN DIAMAGNETISM GRAVITY ANTENNA LEVITATION The principle of diamagnetism which underlies human-induced levitation and anti-gravity vortexes on the planet can be demonstrated simply in what I call the human gravity antenna. Diamagnetism (explained below) is essentially a magnetic-neutral zone existing between a north and south magnetic field, which can be exploited for purposes of levitation. As I will indicate below, there are many such \"magnetic flow reversal points\" on the Earth marked by Grid points. An arrangement of five human beings can be used as a quadruple gravity antenna to perform levitation of the central person. The weight of the central person, the levitatee, does not matter nor is the lack of strength or size of the four levitators important. What is important is the form of the quadropolar positions around the central levitatee (See Diagram 1). Here are a few pointers to keep in mind. First, the levitators should be positioned 45 degrees off the magnetic compass direction of north, south, east, and west for maximum effectiveness. Second, alternation of male and female sex of the levitators adds to the gravity antenna's power. Third, the hand stack on the head of the central levitatee by the levitators should not have like-gendered (male/male, female/female) hands touching. Fourth, there's no need to think of anything— just hold the hands stacked on the levitatee's head for a count of ten. On the tenth count remove the stacked hands quickly and place one finger each on the four corners of the chair. The person in charge of counting says \"lift\" and up goes the levitatee. Now let's examine this phenomenon I like to call \"Party Levitation\" in more specific and practical detail. To do Party Levitation you will need five people, one to be levitated—henceforth to be called the levitatee— and four to do the levitating—henceforth to be called the "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 57 levitators. The levitatee sits in a chair and the four levitators stand around him so that they form a square. One levitator should stand to the levitatee's left, and just behind his shoulder. Another levitator should stand in front of him and to his left, close to his left knee. The other two should stand on the right side of the levitatee's body and in similar positions. Now the object of Party Levitation is to make the levitatee's body so light in weight that the four levitators can lift him several feet into the air using a single finger each. If the experiment is performed properly none of the levitators will feel the slightest resistance to their efforts. It will be as if the levitatee's body has lost its weight entirely. While the levitatee is sitting, the four levitators surround him in the manner indicated and place their hands, one atop the other, on his head, as if they were healing him by the laying on of hands. The person who is going to float must sit relaxed in a straightbacked chair with his legs together, his feet on the floor, and his hands in his lap. The other four participants now stand two on each side of the seated party, one at each shoulder and one at the knee. Instruct all four to extend their arms and place their closed fists toge ther, closed except for the forefingers which should be extended and touching each other along their lengths as shown. The person nearest the seated man's left shoulder is now as ked to place his two extended fingers, palms downwards, beneath his left armpit. Likewise, his opposite number inserts his forefingers beneath the right armpit, and again the other two respectively beneath the seated man's knees. Now invite the four assistants to lift the man in this position, using only these extended fingers. However hard they try, it is impossible. As soon as you have registered their inability to do so, ask them to stack their hands alternately, one on top of the other on the man's head, in such a way that no person has his own two hands together, and then to exert a steady pressure downwards. As they keep this up you count to ten. On the count \"nine\", they must withdraw their hands quickly from his head and resume their earlier positions with their extended forefingers. On the count of \"ten\" they must try again to lift the man with those fingers alone. This time he will go soaring into the air with no difficulty whatsoever. Diamagnetism And Levitation Accomplished at Earth Grid Points "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"58 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID Now, kind reader, reconsider Party Levitation and perhaps do the experiment again but this time have no central person (levitatee). Instead use the heaviest chair you can find. Just stack the hands, touching on the top of the massive chair back and lift (levitate) the heavy chair. Next, place hundreds of pounds of \"dead\" weight (heavy books) on the chair seat and still levitate it easily with four weak children lifting. What is happening here? You have created a small, short-duration diamagnetic levitation vortex which is identical in function to the Earth's big, permanent diamagnetic levitation vortexes at such places as Coral Castle, Florida, or Alice Springs, Australia. Now, reconsider the diagram of the four persons levitating the massive chair. As humans they are the \"mighty four\" of the four cardinal compass points. Each one of the four is an energy lobe around the central object to be levitated. If I call any one of them north, you can call the others, turning counterclockwise, west, south, and east (See Diagram 2). Try doing the levitation with only three people, positioned off-center to the appropriate 90 degree spacing. We know that both the exact number and pattern of the human levitator element, but not their exact size or physical strength, are critical to the levitation. Also we know that inanimate weight levitates as easily as animate through using a human diamagnetic vortex. We might try a piano or even a Volkswagen in place of the chair. The remarkable thing about Party Levitation is that it works anywhere on the Earth's surface, whereas the equivalent big, permanent Earth Grid diamagnetic levitation vortexes all have fixed geographic locations (e.g., southern Florida or central Australia). Whether it's on the surface of the Earth, or within the human sphere of the four levitators, the mechanism for levitation or anti-gravity is identical. In either case there are four energy lobes or directions. The north-south axis elements are usually called magnetic and the east-west axis elements are called diamagnetic. Levitation is produced by diamagnetism existing on the surface of the Earth, (or near it). Diamagnetism operates at 90 degrees from magnetic, but in three directions, and not flat and two-dimensional on a sheet of paper as usually drawn. If magnetism flows in the plane of the Earth's surface, then diamagnetism flows straight up. And straight up is the direction that we call levitation or anti-gravity.

The west lobe is what pulled Florida down and opened the Keys area up. The east lobe is the Bermuda Triangle. Coral Castle will be referred to throughout this chapter, so a few words here of introduction to this impressive project are necessary. Coral Castle is a marvellous demonstration in stone and coral of many hidden principles of magnetics, designed and built in southern Florida by the \"amateur\" scientist Ed Leedskalnin in the 1930s and 1940s. This coral-based temple/residence includes stone furniture, a Moon pond, a North star telescope, a precise Sundial, and other features of exact astronomical alignment. Look at the larger map of the Earth grid (See Diagram 4) and see the diamagnetic (east-west) lobes of Earth grid point #18 in southern Florida. The tip of the Yucatan and the Mexico/Texas coastline clearly show the west diamagnetic lobe shape of Earth grid point #18. The famous Bermuda Triangle is the east diamagnetic energy lobe of Earth grid point #18 (in season). One thing we will immediately note is that the east-west diamagnetic lobes of #18 look like a horizontal \"bow tie\". This happens to be another descriptive name for what is now called in the magnetic sciences a Bloch Wall. The Bloch Wall is central to our understanding of diamagnetism, gravity vortexes, and levitation. A Bloch Wall is a neutral center region at the junction of two magnetic poles (north/south). (See Diagrams 5, 6, 7) It is thereby a \"magnetic flow reversal point\" and is also known as a \"diamagnetic vortex point\". The Bloch Wall is the point of division of the circling vortex, or spin, of the electronic magnetic energies of the north and south poles. The negative energy pole and north pole magnetism spins to the left; the positive energy pole and south pole magnetism spins to the right . The point of zero magnetism and no-spin, and also the point of magnetic reversal where the two spin fields join, is the Bloch Wall. We have two antithetical elements (polarities) meeting and generating a third element, the Bloch Wall, which is a weak pressure (gravity) generator. The south pole is the source and the north pole is the sink . The individual pole energy rotations are three component vectors and the conjunction (Bloch Wall) is a tensor. The resulting \"Broken 8\" figure is a two dimensional concept of a quadropole pattern. We can visualize it as the spin 2, circularly polarized, grav ity wave force field source.

We can state this slightly differently by saying the conjunction of two dipolar generated force field vectors (magnetic and electric) generates a quadropole force field, or gravity. Gravity, as a quadropole source, radiates in a circular 360 degrees polarization pattern, taking two cycles; thus a \"spin 2\" characteristic exists for gravity, and therefore gravity waves have twice the spin of electromagnetic waves. The lack of polarization in the gravity field explains why it cannot be neutralized. As a neutral center force element, gravity cannot have polarities by definition. But it is still just as basic a generated force as the polarized forces of the magnet or the electric fields. The electric field, as well as the magnetic field, has a neutral center effect that is also a gravity wave field source. The two polarized main antithetical force fields (magnetic and electric) are triadic in themselves, as polarization by definition requires, and thus they are both gravity field sources. In all electromagnets the Bloch Wall is actually external to the unit (See Diagram 8). The Bloch Wall, the neutral center gravity wave source, is now in the gap between the magnet faces. In terms of the electromagnetic spectrum, the point of 10 12 Hertz is marked as gravity, while below this is radar, radio, and standard EM frequencies; above it are infrared and optical energy frequencies. This is Nature's neutral center in the radiant energy spectrum where Her standard design triadic system demanded it be placed. 10 12 Hertz is the frequency of radiated gravity (See Diagram 9). In terms of the Earth Grid, where the Bloch Wall of gravity wave field source exists, certain physically anomalous events can take place—such as spontaneous levitation. The Earth's diamagnetic flow field hits a reversal Bloch Wall area (south to north), at these special anomaly points like southern Florida or central Australia. The Equator Line is merely a myth for geographers and fools. The magnetic reversal areas of south to north magnetism flow are near the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer; and these \"spaced out\" anomalies seem to alternate positions around the globe. The best calculation I've arrived at indicates that there are within the Earth Grid a total of 20 magnetic reversal points, with 10 nearly on the Tropic of Capricorn and 10 magnetic reversal points nearly on the Tropic of Cancer. The two sets of ten points are offset almost equally from each "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"66 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID other going around the globe; the northern set is roughly midway between the southern set (See Diagram 10). The planetary distribution of these magnetic reversal points is indicated on the accompanying map. On the large Earth Grid map the northern magnetic reversal points are near #16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 1, 12, 13, 14, and 15 from left to right near the Tropic of Capricorn. The southern magnetic reversal points are near the Tropic of Cancer near Earth grid #46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45. The grid map has to be shifted leftward in the South to space it more nearly correct. The North is closer to true. The resulting Earth grid map puts #44 between #13 and #14, for example. This is the real magnetic flow reversal pattern on the Earth such that above #44 is the northern magnetic flow reversal point (Bloch Wall ). This has a beautiful bow tie of diamagnetic energy flows that can be clearly seen as the east and west coastlines of Australia. The plate push from below forced the diamagnetic bow tie up some but it is still very usable. Why haven't we known about the existence of these 20 magnetic-gravity anomaly points on the Earth Grid before? A compass points North-South anywhere, and so, hiding facts and using the myth of the Equator's magnetic polarity was expedient for our cunning \"masters\"-—the \"power elite\" who control this planet. The reason for hiding it is obvious: If you knew this truth then you would know that Coral Castle, Giza, Alice Springs, etc., were Bloch Wall (bow ties) or Diamagnetic Vortex Points. Extraordinary things can be done at these diamagnetic bow tie reversal points, such as levitating extremely heavy objects (building Coral Castle and the Great Pyramid of Giza) and launching (secretly) the real, massive space ships and probes (as at Alice Springs, Australia, and Lop Nor, China, for example). Official knowledge of the considerable utility of many magnetic-gravity anomaly points on the Grid has taken obvious precedence over any concerns for public safety. If the officials warned the fools in planes and boats to stay out of the Bermuda Triangle at certain times, then ordinary citizens would know too much of their secret knowledge. If you are in the wrong place on the wrong day in the Bermuda Triangle you will be a permanent piece of space junk some 20,000 to 75,000 miles out in space. The Bermuda Triangle off the Florida coast, when active, is a powerful diamagnetic levitator. Usually the Earth contains the energy flow, but with extra stress from the Sun, Moon, and "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"68 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID temperature factors, it ruptures upward and levitates anything over the \"blow\" points. Smal ler ruptures will levitate anything under about 500 pounds—such as people—but not the ships they are on. The magnetic energy flows encounter the Bloch Wall, or bow tie reversal, at these grid locations on Earth. Nature uses the exact same method in a small permanent bar magnet for magnetic polarity reversal. The Bloch Wall is just a great deal larger and much more powerful when operating on the Earth. Didn't anyone ever wonder why there were no Bloch Wall effects on the mythical Equator? If all the Bloch walls for South to North magnetic polarity reversal were at the Equator, no one would have ever crossed it. That is why Nature designed the criss-cross mesh reversal system for polarity reversal. And that is why there are Earth Grid points where the unusual diamagnetic systems exist. These points work extremely well, facilitating the construction of places like Coral Castle or the Great Pyramid or aiding the functions of secret space programs—which are all only large-scale versions of our Party Levitations, using natural Earth diamagnetism as a levitator force. The principles of diamagnetism clearly explain the reasons behind the exact location of secret or publicly-known exploitations of magnetic-gravity anomalies on the Earth Grid. The \"knot\" top (north) on the \"bow tie\" magnetic reversal in a simple bar magnet reversal is the prime location to stage a major gravity-defying feat such as Coral Castle, the Great Pyramid, or an Alice Springs/Lop Nor space program (The Lop Nor desert is where the Chinese space program and nuclear testing is centered). The center area of the Bloch Wall (the bow tie's knot) is the steadiest and strongest magnetic (north) point, which is where Leedskalnin put Coral Castle, the Egyptians put the pyramids, somebody put the Easter Island statues, and where the governmental elites put the Alice Springs/Lop Nor sites. The inventions and researches of the insightful Austrian scientist/naturalist Viktor Schauberger demonstrate the principles of diamagnetism on a small scale of polarity reversals operating in a simple bar magnet. His levitations are diamagnetic systems using water flows. Diamagnetism is the product (or effect) of a flow polarity reversal, like the Bloch Wall of the magnetic flow. Some waterfalls and streams have natural flows of diamagnetism or f l o w reversal effects. Schauberger simply built artificial water flows with internal powerful reversals in flow energy. These are simply a tubed "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 69 version of a Bloch Wall system. The Schauberger water levitators are all continuous type devices for anti-gravity effects. The trout fish, after which Schauberger named his water turbine, senses the coldest area in a waterfall for levitating up it. The waterfall's central spiralling cold flow is an anti-gravity effect area where the energy is driven out (reversed) to directionalized momentum as a natural anti-gravity system. A waterfall's center registers as a zero (or under) on a stressed gravity detector due to the reversed anti-gravity momentum. Schauberger copied this natural design of spiralling cold water flow for levitating system, in his logging flumes and turbines. Schauberger's implosion turbines interrupted the water suction flow by a special shutoff valve, thus creating a reactive back-pressure force in the same direction as the implosion turbine. This reactive back-pressure force is the lifting (discharge cycle) or levitating action (directional momentum) of these types of devices. The Schauberger water turbines were used as the levitators in his versions of the German World War II Project V-7 Fighter aircraft. Thus both Victor Schauberger and Edward Leedskalnin, the builder of Coral Castle in Homestead, Florida, wrote about and demonstrated magnetism and the mechanism of levitation applying natural Earth Grid principles of diamagnetism. ( Editor's Note : Refer to Living Water-Viktor Schauberger and the Secrets of Natural Energy, by Olof Alexandersson, Turnstone Press Ltd., Wellingborough, England, 1982. Also: Magnetic Current , Edward Leedskalnin, Homestead, FL, 1946) Leedskalnin had two secrets. First, he knew where, in terms of the Earth Grid, to build Coral Castle. Second, he knew how to do Party Levitation all alone. Try to figure that one out! Leedskalnin could levitate huge pieces of coral by using the center of mass for the needed slight uplift launching pressure. In Party Levitation, the four outside levitators are lifting the center of mass from the outside edges. If three of the four levitators were to step back at the end of the count of ten hand-stack (charge cycle) and the one remaining levitator would then quickly bend down and reach under the chair to the center of mass and use only two fingers to push upward, then the center man in the chair will levitate. Leedskalnin used a stick or board to push upward at the exact center of mass of his coral slabs to levitate them. Two of the humans (180 degrees apart) in the Party Levitation scenario are \"seen\" by Nature as diamagnetism "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"70 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID sources. The four people are a small, temporary Earth grid point as far as Nature is concerned. Thus the Bloch Wall reversal effect, or diamagnetism, is created and thus levitation of the central area object results. Schauberger put the mechanism in water tubes and Leedskalnin played alone with his massive stones, but in either case, it is exactly the same process of diamagnetic levitation. We must remember Leedskalnin was working on a Diamagnetic Earth Grid Point, so all mass objects in that area are always \"charged\" and easily lifted at their center of mass by a slight upward pushing pressure. Incidentally, due to the shifts in the north and south magnetic poles, Grid Point #18 is now inside Homestead Air Force Base; thus Coral Castle could no longer be built where it is now located. Here are some additional comments on the subject of anti-gravity, or levitation. The reason for the weight of a mass in a gravitational field is the counterpush of the two masses\" gravity radiations. As humans we push more powerfully on the Earth via our stress body than the Earth pushes on us. The total of the two pushes of gravity is so-called weight. If we lose gravity (stress push) by radiating it, as in the Party Levitation central element (levitatee), we push less. As our push (gravity) decreases, the Earth's push-effectiveness on us increases. This is \"weight loss\" or levitation, which is really just letting the Earth push us away. It is not the total quantity of the masses that counts but the effective local gravity field's relative strength. For example, in the fire hose there is a decrease in the gravity (push) of the water. Thus the Earth pushes the water away, or in other words, the \"weight loss\" carries further. The circular (quadropolar) pattern of the whirling fire hose nozzle radiates (relieves) some of the water's gravity (stress). It's important to note that Schauberger's designs are based on this kind of water stress (gravity) control. Levitation (weight loss) control is generally stress lowering via radiation, using gravity's natural characteristics. It works on either organic or inorganic mass, as gravity is the same for both. Think of it as the resultant pushes of two radiating sources, taken locally (These are \"near field\" design problems). Humans are locally a more powerful source of gravity than the Earth because we push down on it. But as we lose gravity (stress push) power, the Earth pushes us away. Here are two final observations in this regard. The forms of self-levitation or single operator induced human levitation appear to be hypnotic trance-state \"shut downs\" of the human "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 71 body's gravity (stress) generati on. Inorganic object levitation, if it is possible, is the \"shut down\" of the gravity (stress) generation of the object itsel f. Theoretically this object levitation is possible (as sugges ted by Coral Castle, pyramids, etc.). A general theory of levitation systems must cover ail of the various methods known to exist. This means there is a common factor among t he diverse approaches of Earth Grid, Party Levitation, Dean Drives, Hooper/Over-Unity Electrical Generators, and Schauberger's devi ces. The common factor is the Zero-Spin Energy Transfer, or the flowing of the nonspin energy. This no nspin energy is a neutral center type of energy flow related to the Bl och Wall phenomena and is the cause of the various types of levitation. In the Earth Grid Magnetic Reversal Points the straight-up, diamagnetic energy flow is a nonspin energy flow. This energy flow is exactly halfway between counterclockwise (north) and clockwise (south) flow and therefore it has no spin. Thus the Bow-Tie Knot levitati on energy is a nonspin energy flow. In Party Levitation the f our levitators drain or temporarily stop the sp in energy flow around the levitatee or the inanimate objects. Thus t hey create a very temporary nonspin energy center which easily levitates. The Dean Drive type devices cross-cut or dump energy during the Critical Action Time that is, in fact, a nonspin energy. Mechanical as it is, the Dean Drive can generate directionalized momentum (nons pin energy flow) and therefore can be used as a levitator system. The electromagnetic collapsing field reversals of Hooper or Over-Unity Genera tors, generate a nonspi n energy flow for short periods during each cycle of operation. Any energetic flow reversal generates some no nspin energy flow. Therefore, electrical coils reve rsals generate some nonspin energy flow and can be used as levitator devices. Schauberger energetic water flow systems are reversed by valving, identical to the el ectrical coil systems. Therefore the Schauberger turbin es generate some nonspin energy flow and can be used as levitators. In a universe of basically spinning energy and particle systems, this nonspin energy has very powe rful effects. The nonspin energy is the neutral cent er force field, belonging to neither side of a generally polari zed universe. As such, it is reacted with and repelled very strongly by all energy and particle systems. By the generation of nons pin energy flows and "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"72 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID the directional vectoring of these flows, we can design most powerful levitating devices. If Nature follows rules, which She does, then all we need do is understand Her methods then apply them. Since diamagnetism is a reaction vector at the reversal point of an energetic flow system, all levitation methods must be similar in Nature. Vortex-Gravity Research Areas Strategically Sited on Earth Grid Points A most interesting pattern of vortex-gravity research exists in the United States and Canada. The pattern is a counterclockwise vortex with four turning points or main centers/corners. The four main centers of vortex research are the extreme southern California area (San Diego and vicinity) , northern Idaho (Coeur D'Alene area), northern New York State (Hudson River/Montreal area), and northern Georgia (See Diagram 11). This box-shaped pattern bows both inward and outward as it widens in the North-South axis, which is made of the two-bowed continental coastlines and the major interior mountain ranges on each coast, with a center at Kansas City (Ellsworth). On the western vortex flow the bowing widens and follows the Pacific Ocean coastlines on one side and the Rocky Mountains on the other side going southward. On the eastern vortex flow the bowing widens and follows the Atlantic Ocean coastline on one side and the Catski ll/Appalachian Mountains on the other side going northward. The east-west vortex flows are relatively straight and narrow between the coastal vortex flows, to complete the general description of the box shape. (Consult the Earth Grid maps below to see these patterns clearly) Another interesting aspect of the Eastern vortex flow is that \"pressure\" flexing out of the southern Caribbean Ocean coming north against the flow produces the anomalous Bermuda Triangle and Lake Ontario phenomena. Once this Earth Grid energy vortex flow gets pushed over or across or into water, massive spontaneous levitation phenomena will occur. The vanished planes, ships, and people often reported are actually thousands of miles out in space from the vortex-gravity toss. NASA knows this fact. Schauberger's water vortex-gravity levitators are based on the same effect (though on a small scale) as the Bermuda "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Diagram 12 Worldwide Gravity Vortex Research Areas Plotted on the World Grid "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"74 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID Triangle/Lake Ontario ph enomena. The old Eldridge (Philadelphia Experiment) data recounts side-effects of the vortex-gravity phenomenon. The Bermuda Triangle is a slanted out push of the north-south grav ity-bucking flows, and Lake Ontario is a focussed slanted in push of the north-south gravity- bucking flows. This is because the Atlant ic coastline's land shape acts as an optical lens system to these bucking- gravity flows. The location of these spec ial vortex-gravity regions makes them most appropriate sites for specialized research (See Diagram 12). Government vo rtex-gravity re search would have to be at Brookhaven, Long Is land and Los Alamos, New Mexico, under the disguise and security of supposed atomic research. Brookhaven is the bes t location due to the land fall pinch on the Hudson River flow . International governmental vortex-gravity research would have to be at Alice Springs/Pine Gap in Central Au stralia, because of the Earth Grid requirements and again under the disguise of atomic research. From the above data, it c an easily be seen that the geographical shape of the United States (c oastlines, mountains) is not accidental. Kansas City (Ellsworth) is a midway point and Las Vegas is directly cent ered as #16, 17, and 18. Moreover, the pressure source s from South America flowing northward to buck the natural Earth Grid flows in the North America vortex also help produce the Bermuda Triangle and Lake Ontario phenomena. Note the accompanying maps. Australia's map shows why Alice Springs is used for gr avity research—note how the MacDonnell Mountains turn 90 degrees to run east-west against the pressure flow above Alice Sp rings. Australi a's very shape gives away the pressures that have been applied to it. The bowing pressure from the Arctic area is obvious in the shape of the Aleutian Islands, but Amchita Island right on Grid Map point #6 is the best for gravity research. It has plate push pressure on either side of it as well. Ed Leedskalnin understood completely that the exact location is criticial for build ing such a structure as Coral Castle. But how did he know ex actly where Mother Nature would allow him to site this marvellous example of levitational engineering? Quite simply, he observed Nature, which is all it takes to have true knowledge of the natural forces of Earth. Nature's Gravity Vortex Center pulled Florida counterclockwise around some 90 degrees to its vortex center"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Diagram 13 Earth Grid Wars "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"76 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID like a gate-leg table. The Gravit y Pull Center Vortex energy also pulled counterclockwise on the southern end of Florida itself. On the map of southern Florida I have dr awn the opening arc and the exact Gravity Pull C enter, which is at maximum some 10 miles on either si de of the physica l center, but strongest in the maximum counte rclockwise position of North. Draw a triangle from where t he Florida Keys start to where they stop to see the Gravity Vortex Pull Center point. The land's end, at Key Largo, is exactly as far sout h from the Gravity Vortex Pull Center as Coral Cast le is directly north. This is what Leedskalnin saw on his maps. The specific site location for Coral Castle and Homestead A.F.B. in southern Florida is situated at the maximum Gravity Pull Vortex Center position (counterclockwise or north). The distance from the Vortex Center is measured by using \"land's end\" at t he South to tell you where the maximum equal poin t location straight North (maximum counterclockwise) of the Vortex Center is. All that Leedskalnin had to do was \"see\" what the maps were telling him, because Nature draws vivid, exact pictures of Her forces for th ose who have eyes to see them. Then Leedskalnin simply used this Gr avity Pull Vortex Center to levitate the huge blocks of native coral into place to make his Castle. A five year old could stack up automobiles in that general area. Once t he operation of the Moth er Earth's gravity system is known, t hen engineering artifi cial systems is simple. The patriarchal scientists of the cunning and stupid varieties who study gr avity at these loca tions will fail because they all hate Nature, the female, and r eality. Whereas \"simple\" men who like Nature and only observe Her thereby accomplish great things—witness Sch auberger and Leedskalnin. The control attitude of patriarchal religions or se cular humanism cannot force Nature with their writings, equations, and bulldozers to do anything. If yo u really want to engineer Nature's systems and forces, yo u must adore Nature, the female, and reality, an attitude which is the total inverse of the present patriarchal/scientific system. Our newfound awareness of t he geopoltical importance of certain diamagnetic Earth Grid Po ints introduces the subject of Earth Grid Wars. The \"Three Floridas\" (Florida, Korea, and Vietnam) are still critical Earth Grid points after two bloody wars(See Diagram 13). The \"boost shock-point\" to this triangle is Libya. The Caribbean Plate has more recently seen a triangulation "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 77 attempt that ended in military invasion. The Caribbean Plate triangle shock-wave system was to have been Grenada-Cuba-Nicaragua. The next try in this general area is absolute control of the Chilean Earth Grid point. The Union of South Africa's Grid point is critically necessary for control of both Europe and Australia. The Phillipines position on the major fault/plate system is pivotal to control of both Australia and Japan in the Pacific Basin. The Soviets already have secured and activated the site in Afghanistan. Now, read again about the targeted countries in the daily newspapers and figure out who is currently winning the Earth Grid Wars. However, a truly expert knowledge of the Earth Grid system with a true understanding of Mother Nature's ways could still reverse this bleak picture of geopolitical control through command of Earth Grid locations. A discussion of the Grid would be incomplete without some commentary on the Earth Grid Shifts. The Earth's magnetic poles do not completely shift (reverse or flip). Only the Earth's Bloch Wall Magnetic Reversal Anomalies move positions in both the northern and southern hemispheres to balance the Earth. The Bloch Wall anomalies were much further north some 10-15,000 years ago, at the time of their last estimated major movement. This Bloch Wall Magnetic Reversal area movement is caused by the Earth's expansions and possible contractions, land mass weight shifts, and changes in the Sun. The so-called deluge and glacier phenomena are really caused by the massive ocean/sea tides and levitation effects at these times of balancing by the Earth Bloch Wall Anomaly position movements. There were no deity-caused floods or Ice Age glaciers; there were only the Earth Grid Magnetic Reversal Anomaly movements. These movements would have been Earth-shakingly impressive to observe; later they were recalled in myth and religious lore worldwide. Moreover, our knowledge of the Earth Grid mapping systemenables us now to plot major geopolitical, meteorological, and geological anomalies and disturbances with reference to possible magnetic-gravity coordinates (See Diagram 14). Did we really think that a dynamically changing fly-wheel/gyro-like Earth sphere, at about 1000 miles per hour spin rate, didn't need or didn't have a correctional balance system? If it were not for the 20 movable locking points, or what we now call Earth Grid Magnetic Reversal Anomalies , this Earth would tear itself apart (See Diagram 15).

HARMONY: A state of order, agreement, or completeness in the relations of things, or of parts of a whole to each other. 2. HARMONIC: Producing, characterised by, or pertaining to, harmony, (a). Music: Pertaining to a tone whose ra te of vibration is an exact multiple of a given primary tone. (b).

In this book I discuss the fundamental harmonies of the vibrational frequencies which form the building-bloc ks of our immediate universe; and those of the theoretical anti-universe wh ich modern scientists have postulated as existing in mirror-like image of our own. I theorise that the whole of physical reality which is tangible to us is formed from the basic geometric harmonies, or harmonics, of the angular velocities, or wave-forms, of light. From these basic harmonies, or resona ting wave-forms, myriad other waves are created which blend in sympathetic resonance, one with the other, thus forming the physical structures. Einstein stated that the geometric structure of space-time determines the physical processes. I theorise that space and time manifest from the geometric harmonies of the wave-motions of li ght. The fundamental harmonic of light, in free space, in geometric terms being an angular velocity of 144,000 minutes of arc per grid second, there being 97,200 grid seconds to one revolution of the earth. When physical matter is manifested in the universe the wave-forms of light from which it is formed are slowed down fractionally in order to release the energy required for the formation process. This is demonstrated by the unified harmonic equations in Chapter On e. It was found that to calculate the values of harmonic wave-forms that have sympathetic resonance it was possible to disregard zeros to the right, or left, of whole numbers and extract the values direct from the mathematical tables. "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 83 My interest in the increasing UFO activity in the New Zealand area led me to the discovery that the surface of the wo rld was crisscrossed with an intricate network of energy grid lines. I began my research in 1965. The information in this chapter regarding the structure an d mathematical values built into the system will consist ot material condensed from my first three books plus the findings derived from my recent research up to early 1982. In a general way I was convinced that UFOs were actively engaged in a survey of the earth for some definite r eason. I felt that their visits, were not haphazard; they were not just on casual sightseeing tours. Quite a number of investigators around the world had come to the conclusion that the sightings were beginning to form a pattern. At this period, however, this pattern was so complex as to defy any definition, or solution. By the correlation of sightings small sections of track had been identif ied, and some saucers had been seen moving along these set paths. Some of these had hovered over certain spots at set intervals. But these bits and pieces of tracklines were so scattered around the surface of our planet that it was quite impossible to fit them together into any semblance or order. I was certain that if an overall pattern could be found and plotted, it might be possible to establish the reason behind U FO activity. 1 considered that the pattern would be geometric if these th ings were intelligently controlled, and that if somehow I could find the key to one section then I might solve the rest by duplication and inference. I had sighted a number of unidentified objects in the sky over a period of several years, and by correlating two of these with other data 1 was eventually able to construct a grid system which covered the whole world. One of the sightings was in 1956. 1 was a DC3 co-pilot crewing a flight from Auckland to Paraparaumu. It was a bout 6pm, conditions were calm, and there was unlimited visibility. We were just south of Waverley at 7000 feet when I saw this object at an extremel y high altitude in the east. 1 drew the captain's attention to it and together we watched it travel in a curved trajectory from east to west across our tr ack until it disappeared in a flash of light at about 10,000 feet in the area of D'Urville Island. It appeared to travel across New Zealand in the vicinity, or slightly to the north, of Cook Strait. and it was so large that two streaks, similar to vapour trails, were seen to extend from either side of its pale green disc. When about halfway across the Strait a small object detached itself from the parent body and dropped vertically until it disappeared. It looked almost as if the main disc was at such a high temperature that a globule had dripped from it. I thought about this later and de cided that if that were so, the small object would also have a curved trajectory in the direction of the parent body. But this was not so; it detached and dropped vertically down at great speed. There could be only one answer for this action; the small body must have been controlled. "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"84 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID Calculations at a later date proved this UFO to have been between 1500— 2000 feet in diameter. A report in a Nelson newspaper on the following day described an explosion at a high altitude to the north of the city. The shock- wave broke windows in some local glasshouses. The other sighting occurred on 12 March 1965. This was the bestand most interesting of them all, and from then my investigations were pressed on with all speed until they culminated in my present findings. I had always expected to see UFOs in the sky, and that was where my attention was usually focussed. When 1 was flying I was alert and ready to analyse any object sighted from the aircraft. I never expected to find a saucer landing at my feet and so far this has never happened. This sighting however, was different from all the others because I observed it lying under thirty feet of water. 1 was scheduled to carry out a pos itioning flight from Whenuapai, Auckland's main airport at the time, to Kaitaia. Departure was at 1 lam and as no passengers were involved and the weather was perfect, I decided to fly visually to Kaitaia along the west coast. An officer from the operations department was on board and this wa s a good opportunity to show him some of the rugged country to the north. (I must stress that air-traffic regulations were strictly observed during the flight). On leaving Whenuapai I climbed to clear the area and when approaching the southern end of the Kaipara Harbour , just north of Helensville, 1 dropped to a lower altitude to have a better look at anything in the flight path. The tide in the harbour was well out, and the water over the mudflats and estuaries was quite shallow. 1 suppose we were about a third of the way across the harbour when I spotted what I took to be a stranded gr ey-white whale. 1 veered slightly to port, to fly more directly over the object and to obtain a better look. I suppose a pilot develops the habit of keeping his emotions to himself. As far as 1 can remember 1 gave no indication of surprise, and I said nothing as I looked down. My \"whale\" wa s definitely a metal fish . I could see it very clearly, and I quote from the notes 1 made later. A. The object was perfectly streamlined and symmetrical in shape. B. It had no external control surfaces or protrusions. C. It appeared metallic, and there was a suggestion of a hatch on top, streamlined in shape. It was not quite halfway along the body as measured from the nose. D. It was resting on the bottom of the estuary and headed towards the south, as suggested from the streamlined shape. E. The shape was not that of a normal submarine and there was no superstructure. F. I estimated the length as 100 feet, with a diameter of 15 feet at the widest part. G. The object rested in no more than 30 feet of clear water. The bottom of the harbour was visible and the craft was sharply defined. "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 85 Inquiries made from the navy confirmed that it would not have been possible for a normal submarine to be in this particular position, due to the configuration of the harbour and coastline. An American scientist checked this spot on the harbour with a depth- sounder in September 1969. He informed me afterwards that a hole had been detected in the harbour bed approximate ly one eighth of a mile wide and over 100 feet deep, which 1 consider would indicate some activity had been carried out in this position some five years previously. 1 published the scientist's report in my second book. I had a further key to the puzzle in April 1965. My wife saw an advertisement in the local paper se eking members for a UFO organisation called New Zealand Scientific and Space Research. I contacted this organisation and found that a vast am ount of information had been very efficiently compiled. Material had been collected from twenty-five different countries over a period of twelve years. 1 was invited to study the information at leisure. Amongst this mass of data I discovered the reports of a UFO that had been seen from several different localities in both islands of New Zealand on March 26 1965. People in Napier, New Plym outh, Palmerston North, Wanganui, Feilding and Otaki Forks in the North Island; Nelson Coast Road, Blenheim and Westport (Cape Foulwind) in the South Island, had all reported sightings. It was decided that I try to plot the track of this UFO. From the considerable amount of information available I found that the maximum variation in the times of sightings from all areas was 15 minutes. Most reports gave the time as 9.45pm. This proved that the object must have been very large and at a high altitude during the greater part of its trajectory. There was nothing of any great significa nce or originality in these accounts, and they followed the pattern of many other sightings. However from the mass of detail supplied by so many di fferent people over so wide an area, it was possible to plot the track of the object with reasonable accuracy. 1 started work on a Mercator's plotting chart, and after several hours of checking one report against the other, and calculating possible elevations and trajectories, 1 felt I had refined the plot sufficiently to draw in the final track of the object, or objects. The result is shown on map I. The track began about seventy nautic al miles north of New Plymouth, passed just over to the west of Mt Eg mont, and finished at D'Urville Island. When first seen the altitude would have been about 30,000 feet curving down on a flight path to somewhere around 10,000 feet when it disappeared. Some time after those sightings on 26 March 1965 I had another look at the plot 1 have made. I could find no flaws in my thinking, but I needed more information. As I was to discover many times later, the clues were quite obvious, but 1 was not then sufficiently e xpert in realising their significance. In point of fact t h i s first trackline was to be the starting point of a whole string of discoveries of which I have yet to f i n d an end. I pored over that plot for a long time before it suddenly occurred to me that the track appeared to be in l i n e with the position where 1 had sighted the unidentified submarine object, or USO, on 12 March 1965. On extending the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"86 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID line back 1 found it was in line with th e sightings of 26 March. 1 was positive there had to be a connection — but to prove it was a different matter. 1 checked my report files again and found that on 2 March some fishermen just north of the coast of New Plymout h had seen a large object plunge into the sea and disappear. They thought it was an aircraft and reported the incident to the appropriate authoritie s, but no aircraft or personnel were missing. I checked this position on the map and found that it also fitted the established trackline. Was this connect ed with the USO of 12 March, and could the two sightings be of the same object, sighted twice in ten days? Could it be working slowly up this track carrying out some project on the sea bed? 1 tucked this thought away for future re ference and carried on with the search. "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 87 It was some days later that I remembered the UFO I had seen in 1956. This object was similar and, most significan t of all, both objects had apparently travelled at 90° to each other, and finished in the same grand all-illuminating flash in the area of D'Urville Island. If these objects were not controlled, how could anyone explain such coincidences? No two meteors or other natural phenomena could coincidentally carry out similar manoeuvres, travel at 90° to each other, and both decide to end theirexistence at the same point in space, within nine years of each other. Also, in both cases, objects had been seen to emerge from the parent bodies. Was this i rrefutable evidence that they were intelligently controlled vehicles? I plotted the track of the 1956 U FO on the map at 90° to the north-south line. I realised that 1 had no definite proof that they were at exactly 90° to each other or that the 1956 track was not a fe w miles north or south of this position — still, I had to start from somewhere, and I would assume this to be correct unless and until other evidence proved me wrong. Two track lines at 90° meant little on their own. If 1 found several at 90°, 1 might have something — a grid perhaps? These two lines hinted at this, and I believed that if 1 could solve the system of measurement, then 1 had two ready made baselines to work from. Once again I went to the UFO files and found that a Frenchman by the name of Aime Michel had been studyi ng UFOs for a number of years and had found small sections of tr acklines in various areas of Europe. Saucers had been seen hovering at various points along these tracklines, and Mr Michel had observed that the average distance between these points was 54.43 kilometres. By itself this was only a small grain of information but, like a starting gun, it set me off again. Using the Kaipara Harbour as a star ting point, I marked off the 54.43 kilometre intervals along the trackline I had found. I was disappointed when I was unsuccessful in obtain ing an even distribution of positions to the D'Urville Island disappearing point. 1 checked and re-checked, but nothing worked out. 1 slept on the problem, and at some time during the night inspiration turned up the wick; once more the light grew bright. I remembered that a great number of sightings had occurred around the Blenheim area. Even before the advent of ordinary aircraft in New Zealand, this area had been visited by UFOs. I had read about them in old copies of the local papers, and many recent sightings suggested again that this area had something special about it. So I dragged out my map and extended the trackline until it cut a 90° coordinate from the town of Blenheim. The distance from this point to the Kaipara position I found to be exactly 300 nautical miles, and one nautical mile is equal to one minute of arc on the earth's surface. Could it be that the rough interval of 54.43 kilometres disc overed by Michel was, in fact, an interval of 30 nautical miles when corre cted? If so then this interval could be evenly spaced along my trackline ten times. Was this the system of measurement used by the U FO's? There was no proof, of course, but it seemed a reasonable assumption. A minute of arc is a measurement which could be applied to the whole universe. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"88 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID University personnel and others in the academic field attacked me repeatedly over this issue. They maintained that degrees and minutes of arc were arbitrary values set up by the anci ent mathematicians and that therefore my calculations were meaningless. I fina lly found proof of my argument in the works of Pythagoras. As my research progressed 1 discovered that the harmonic of the speed of light in free space had a value of 144. If this was divided by 2, to find the harmonic of one half cycle, or half-wave, the answer was 72. If this value was then applied to the Pythagoras right-angled 3, 4, 5 triangle and each side was extended in th is ratio then the figure had sides of 216, 288 and 360 units. The harmonic proportions thus derived were equal to: 2 1 6 = 21600 = the number of minutes of arc in a circle. 360 = 360 = the number of degrees in a circle. 288 = (144 x 2) = 2C, where C = the speed of light harmonic. It appeared from this that the harm onic of light had a very definite relationship with the geometry of a circle, and that the early mathematicians were fully aware of the fact. This will b ecome clearer as you read through this book. The fifth interval of 30 nautical m iles from the Kaipara position coincided with the position off the coast of New Plymouth where the mysterious object had plunged into the sea. The plotted points of disappearance of the two large UFOs at D'Urville Island did not quite match up with the ninth interval, but this did not worry me unduly as I expect ed that a small percentage of error must be expected in my original plot. I readjusted this position to the ninth interval, and carried on the search to see how many other sightings I could fit into this pattern. The results exceeded my expectations. I found that by using units of 30 minutes of arc latitude north-south, and 30 minutes of arc longitude east- west, on my Mercator's map, a grid pattern was formed into which a great number of UFO reports could be fitted. I eventually had a map with sixteen stationary and seventeen moving UFOs plotted on grid intersections and tracklines. Having satisfied myself that my reas oning and plotting were not false, 1 considered that I had good proof that New Zealand, possibly othercountries, and probably the whole world, were be ing systematically covered by some type of grid system. In my first book 1 demonstrated that the main grid pattern consisted of grid lines spaced at intervals of 30 minutes of arc (latitude and longitude). In my second book I probably confused the issue a bit as I stated that the east-west grid lines were spaced at 24 minutes of arc. This was due to the spacing being measured in nautical miles, or values in minutes of latitude. The actual length of a minute of longitude varies mathema tically from one nautical mile at the equator, to zero at the north and south poles. The value of 30 minutes of arc in terms of longtitude in the New Zealand area happened to be an average of 24 nautical miles, which can be confusing those readers who are not familiar with map scales. "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 89 Reference to the grid structure will therefore be stated from now on in minute of arc values only, for latitude and longitude, to minimise confusion. I subsequently discovered that the grid lattice could be further divided. It is now evident that the grid lines in the main system are spaced at intervals of 7.5 minutes of arc north-south, and east-we st. The importance of this will prove itself when compared with the rest of the calculations in this book. There are 21,600 minutes of arc in a circle, and when this is divided by 7.5 we get a value of 2880. The grid lattice therefore is tu ned harmonically to twice the speed of light (288), as will be shown in other sections. It appeared that 1 had found a section of geometric grid pattern in the New Zealand area. I now had to form some theory of construction for the whole world. I could then possibly fit the New Zealand section into it. By drawing a series of patterns on a small plastic ball I finally found a system which could be used as a starting point for a global investigation. (The basic pattern is shown in diagram 1). 1 was sure I was on the right track, but now I had to super-impose this pattern on the world globe. It was e ssential that I find a point position somewhere on the earth upon which to or ientate the geometrical pattern. I finally came up with an item of news that gave me a very important clue on how to proceed. On 29 August 1964 the American survey ship Eltanin was carrying out a sweep of the sea-bed off the coast of South America. A series of submarine photographs was being taken of the area by means of a camera attached to a long cable. A surprise was in store when these photographs were developed. On one of the points, in marvellous de tail, was an aerial-type object sticking up from an otherwise featureless sea-bed. This object appeared to be metallic and perfectly symmetrical in construction. The array consisted of six main crossbars with small knob-like ends and a small crossbar at the top. Ea ch cross looked to be set at angles of 15° to the others, and the whole syst em stood about 2 feet in height. The position where this object was found wa s given as latitude 59°08' south, longitude 105° west. As this bit of ironmongery was situated.at a depth of 13,500 feet b'elow the surface, I was certain that no hum an engineers had placed it there. Scientists may be able to descend to those depths in specially constructed bathyspheres, but I don't think they could work as deeply as that on a precision engineering problem. In view of my earlier sightings in the Kaipara Harbour, I was willing to accept that the aerial-type object had been placed there by an un-identified submarine object, or USO. Since this photo was taken there has been a determined attempt by the scientific world to label this object as nothing more than a plant of some sort. A journalist friend and I managed to visit the Eltanin during one of its few visits to New Zealand and when we di scussed this object with some of the scientists on board, the comment was that it was classed as an artefact. This was before the great hush-up but, rega rdless of that, 1 believe that the mathematical proofs will show without doubt that the object is artifical, and most probably an aerial of some sort. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"90 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID An \"OOPART\". Photographed on the sea- bed at a depth of 2,500 fathoms, 1,000 miles west of Cape Horn, by US survey ship Eltanin, whose officers are close-lipped about it. \"It's a marine organism,\" maintained an Eltanin officer in Auckland in 1968. Pressed further, he admitted: \"But it still looks like an artifact to me!\" "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 93 The form of this aerial-like structure al so fitted in with the general pattern of the grid as I had envisaged it on the plastic ball. The six main crossbars denoted the radiating points of s i x or twelve great circles which form the main structure of the grid. 1 centred the grid on the position of the object found by the Eltan'm, and the 180° reciprocal of this in Russian Siberia, lining the whole thing up with the section I had found in New Zealand. I found the system to be lined up very closelywith the magnetic field of the ear th. The equator of the grid followed very closely the line of zero dip around the world. (That is, the positions on the earth's surface where a magnetic compas s needle has only a horizontal and no vertical component). In my first two books 1 discussed the methods 1 used to line up the system and calculate the first estimates of the grid pole positions, and the maior focal points of the grid similar to the Eltanin \"aerial\" placement. The reciprocal position ot the Eltanin \"aerial\" is at latitude 59° 08' north, longitude 75° east, in Siberia. I calculate d the length of the diagonal of what I call, for simplicity, the \"polar grid square\" and found it to be 5091.168825 minutes of arc long. I plotted a track from the Siberian position through the north geographic pole and measured off th is distance to locate another corner \"aerial\" of the polar square. (Square is not technically the right word to use as the four sides are formed by sections of small circles which are in different planes to each other. When the \"polar square\" areas are transferred from the surface of the earth sphere on to a flat plane such as a map. then a perfect square is formed with sides 3600 minutes long and diagnals of 5091.168825 minutes of arc). In my first two books 1 stated, in error, that the sides of the \"polar squares\" were formed by sections of GREAT circ les 3600 minutes of arc long, instead of SMALL circles. The great circle distance between these points is in fact 3418.606915 minutes of arc, which is ve ry confusing to any investigator attempting to reconstruct the grid. I apol ogise to my readers for this error, which was caused by my lack of access to calculators during my earlier research. In the grid pattern there are actually two small-circle segments, and one great circle segment connecting each of these points which form the polar squares. Each of the segments has a different path over the earth and some tricky calculating is necessary to ascertain the true length. Although I used the wrong term in my earlier publications, the actual calculat ions derived from the grid system are not altered in any way, and still stand the test of time. Over the last few years I have slightly refined the values I demonstrated previously, derived from a mixture of practical and theoretical studies. 1 have now set up what 1 see as a completely theoretical system, discovered by working entirely by calculator. Time will prove how close my calculations are. I have no doubt that 1, and others, will continue furthe r to perfect the system as more facts come to light. Once I had established this first base li ne I found it quite easy to construct the main skeleton of the grid over the whole surface of the earth. As my work progressed 1 found that there were in fact two similar grids, interlocked with each other. The poles of the grids were spaced at different distances from the north geometric pole, and t h i s arrangement set up a series of geometric harmonics which were directly related to the speed of light, mass, and gravity. The interaction of the two grids created a harmonic resonance which, in turn, formed a third resultant grid. After ten years of work and correlati ng information 1 have now calculated"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"94 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID theoretical positions for the three grid poles in the northern hemisphere which are very close to my original estimate . Reciprocal positions will give similar values for the southern hemisphere. Grid pole (A) = La titude 72.4266°/longitude 90° west 1054.4 minutes of arc from the north pole. Grid pule \"B\" = Latitude 78.4266°/longitude 105° west 694.4 minutes of arc from the North Pole. Resultant grid pole \"C\" = Latitude 75.6°/longitude 97.5° west 864 minutes of arc from the North Pole. The diagonal of the \"polar square\" of 5091.168825 units can be broken down into a series of values: 5091.168824 / 2 = 2545.584412 2545.584412 / 7.5 = 3.39411255 3.39411255 2 = 11.52 11,52 / 8 = 1.44 (speed of light harmonic) 2545.584412 2 = 6480000 Reciprocal of 2545.584412 = .03928371 The harmonic value of 3928371 is of ex treme importance as it has a direct relationship with the earth's magnet ic field. The harmonic 648 was also shown, in my earlier books, to have many interesting associations. In particular the harmonic table for temperature. The many other harmonic factors, centred around the \"polar square\" corner \"aerial\" positions, form a series of complex mathematical associations, and this can be left for those who wish to carry out their own research. If I can show how to construct the main \"bones\" of the grid my part of the job will be complete. I have found it impossible, so far, to plot the fine grid structure of lines 7.5 minutes apart, over the whole world, because of the complexity of such an exercise. (A full computer programme would be necessary and I do not have the finance required for such an undertaking). So far I have confined myself to the New Zealand area, with the small section of finely-spaced grid lines that I originally discovered. Over the years I have been able to plot into this ma p a great many interesting facts which indicate activity by various scientific gr oups. This has helped me to gradually build up my own knowledge of the system. My nosiness has not gone unnoticed — as evidenced by the constant probing of interested parties endeavour ing to find out the extent of my discoveries. 1 hope that in the near future the international combines involved in this advanced research will make known to the public the vast amount of scientific knowledge they have aquired. Possibly this will only happen if and when a world government has been se t up to control the scientific wonders "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 95 which are now within our reach. Enough is known already to make most of our energy and transport systems obsolete — which may explain why the facts are being suppressed? I have been able to check activity in other parts of the world by applying harmonic calculation to cert ain positions of latitude and longitude. It is not necessary to use the grid structure, and such, for some types of calculation once the harmonic process is understood . Eventually, when the whole grid has been plotted, the work will be much easier. In my second book I stated that the first glimmerings of how true space travel might be achieved came to me when I uncovered the clues that led me to the UFO grid which laces about our globe. 1 was aware that my calculations were not precisely accurate — in the strict mathematical sense — but 1 could see that the system was based on space-time geometries, and at least there was the best possible support for this: none less than the theories of Einstein. Somewhere, I knew, the system contained a clue to the truth of the unified field which, he had postulated, permeates all of existence. 1 didn't know at the time that this clue had already been found by scientists who were well ahead of me. I know now that they must have understood something of the grid system years ago. They knew that Einstein's ideas about the unified field were correct. What's more, for many years they had been carrying out full-scale research into the practical applications of the mathematical concepts contained in that theory. We were told that Einstein died without completing his equations relating to the unified theory. But in more recent times it has been said that he did in fact complete his work but that the concepts were so advanced that the full truth was not released. The only way to traverse the vast distances of space is to possess the means of manipulating, or altering, the very structure of space itself; altering the space-time geometric matrix, which to us provides the illusion of form and distance. The method of achieving this lies in the alteration of frequencies controlling the matter-antimatter cycl es which govern our awareness, or perception, of position in the space-time structure. Time itself is a geometric, just as Einstein postulated; if time can be altered, then the whole universe is waiting for us to come and explore its nook and crannies. In the blink of an eye we could cross colossal distances; for distance is an illusion. The only thing that keeps places apart in space is time. If it were possible to move from one position to anothe r in space, in an infinitely small amount of time, or \"zero time\", then both the positions would coexist, according to our awareness. By speeding up the geometric of time we will be able to bring distant places within clos e proximity. This is the secret of the UFOs - they travel by means of altering the spatial dimensions a round them and repositioning in space-time. I decided to concentrate specifica lly on three harmonic values which appeared to have a close relationship with each other. Previously 1 had shown this connection and had t r u t h l u l l y pointed out that I did not know why the relationship was there at a l l . "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"96 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID The harmonic values which occupied my full attention: 1703 - This was the four-figure harmonic of 170,300,000,000, which is the expression in cubic minutes of arc of th e mass, or volume, of the planet earth, and its surrounding atmosphere. 1439 — A four-figure harmonic of 143,900 minutes of arc per grid second, representing the speed of light in grid values. 2640 — This figure expressed in minute of arc values is built into the polar portion of the grid structure, as a geometric coordinate. I found that when 1 matched these values harmonically the results were as follows. Zeros to the right-hand side can be ignored in this form of harmonic calculation: 1703 -264 1439 In other words the difference between the harmonic of mass and the harmonic of light was the harmonic of 264 (or 2640). It was apparent that if my calculations were more accurately worked out it should be possible to find out just what the 2640 figure referred to. After more calculation the following terms were found: 17025 Earth mass harmonic -2636 Unknown harmonic 14389 Speed of light harmonic Checking through some five-figure math ematical tables. 1 found to my surprise that 2.6363 is the square ro ot of 6.95 (from the 1-10 square root tables). In harmonic calculation decimal po ints as well as zeros to the right or left of a figure can be ignored; so it could be said that the square root of 695 was 2636. I could perceive from this the first steps necessary to solve the elusive equation. 1 had established that 695 was the harmonic reciprocal of the speed of light, or 1 /1439 subject to the accuracy of my calculations at the time. It was now possible to substitute al gebraic values - although obviously a computer would be necessary to solve the true values to extreme accuracy. 17025 (earth mass) -2636 square root of speed of light reciprocal 14389 (speed of light) If C = The speed of light, and M - Mass Then M = C + sqrt(1/C) "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 97 I had the first part of a unified fiel d equation in harmonic values. To take the next step I first had to go back to Einsteinian theory, particularly the famous equation E = MC 2 , where E is energy, M is mass and C the speed of light. Einstein declared that physical matter was nothing more than a concentrated field of force. What we term a physical substance is in reality an intangible concentration of wave-forms. Different combinations of structural patterns of waves unite to form the myriad chemicals and elements which in turn react with one another to form physical substances. Different wave- forms of matter appear to us to be so lid because we are constituted of similar wave-forms which resonate within a cl early defined range of frequencies — and which control the physical processes of our limited world. Einstein believed that M, the value for mass in the equation, could eventually be removed and a value substituted that would express the physical in the form of pure energy. In other words, by substituting for M a unified field equation should result which woul d express in mathematical terms the whole of existence — including this universe and everything within it. Einstein maintained that the M in his equation could be replaced by a term denoting wave-form. I had found a substitute for M in terms of wave-forms of light. So the obvious step, to me, was to replace Einstein's M with the values of C found from the grid system . The results are as follows: I now had a harmonic unified field equa tion expressed in terms of light — or pure electromagnetic wave form — th e key to the universe, the whole of existence: to the seen and the unseen, to forms, solids, liquids and gases, the stars and the blackness of space itself, all consisting of visible and invisible waves of light. All of creation is light. It was now necessary to refine my ca lculations and atte mpt to discover a way to practically apply this initial equation. The equation is that from which an at omic bomb is developed, by setting up derivatives of the equation in geometric form, the relative motions of the wave- forms inherent in matter are zeroed, and convert from material substance back into pure energy. This explained the workings of a nuclear explosive device, but it still did not yield the secret of space-time propulsion. The grid system which 1 discovered by the study of the movement of unidentified flying objects was harmonically tuned to this basic equation, yet a UF O does not disintegrate when it moves within the resonating fields of the network. There had to be an extension of the equation which so far I had missed that would produce the necessary harmoni cs for movement in space-time. "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"98 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID In the polar areas of the grid the geometric values of some of the coordinates appeared to be doubled up. The coordinate of 2545584412 was doubled in the diagonals of the polar sq uares, with all of its associated harmonics and other factors appeared to be doubled when the pattern was projected onto a flat plain. 1 reasoned that a way to check this idea was to increase the values of C in the equation, and observe the changing harmonic of E to see what relative values might emerge. I thought at the time that a direct antigravitational harmonic might become evident, but my recent research has proved this line of thought to be incorrect. In terms of mathema tical values I found what I was hunting for in the form of two more equations. In the case of one of the equations I erroneously believed that the derived harm onic value related to the reciprocal of gravity. I know now that what I had hold of was an equation related to the magnetic field of the earth. The earth being simply a huge magne t, a dynamo, wound with magnetic lines of force as it coils, tenescopi cally counted to be 1257 TO THE SQUARE CENTIMETRE IN ONE DIRECTION AND 1850 TO THE SQUARE CENTIMETRE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION (EDDY CURRENTS), indicates that natural law has placed these lines as close together as the hairs on one's head. The spectroscope shows that there is an enormous magnetic field around the sun, and it is the present conclusion of the best minds that magnetic lines of force from the sun envelop this earth and extend to the moon, and THAT EVERYTHING, NO MATTER WHAT ITS FORM ON THIS PLANET, EXISTS BY REASON OF MAGNETIC LINES OF FORCE. This I agree with, according to my own research. We are taught in our schools and universities that the magne tic field passes through one magnetic pole, then through the body, and out the other magnetic pole. I disagree with this explanation. I believe that the magne tic lines of force enter the body at the poles, then carry out a looped path through the body before passing out the opposite poles. The flow is not in one pole and out the other, but in both poles, and out both poles, although the field intensity both ways is unbalanced. If we can visualise one line of force so that we can trace out its path we can form an analogy by imagining it to be similar to a piece of string. First of all we make a loop in the piece of string. Now imagine it being fed through a fixed position with the loop remaining stationa ry relative to a fixed point. With the length of string as the axis we can now make the loop revolve in a path which is at 90° to the movement of the string. The loop in fact would trace out a spherical-shaped form in space. The lines of force of the magnetic field would form a lattice, or grid pattern, due to the spin of the planetary body. A good analogy would be an ordinary machine-wound ball of string. The length of string has taken on the form of a ball, and at the same time has formed a crisscross pattern. If we again visualise this as a physical body being formed in space then we can now imagine a small vortex being created at all the trillions of points where the lines of force cross each other in the lattice pattern. Each vortex would manifest as an atomic structure and create within itself what we term a gravitational field. The "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 99 gravitational field in other words is nothing more than the effect of relative motion in space. Matter is drawn towards a gravitational field, just as a piece of wood floating on water is drawn to wards a whirlpool. The gravitational fields created by the vortexual action of every atom would combine to form the field of the completed planetary body. The world grid that 1 speak of is the natu ral grid that is formed by the lattice pattern of the interlocking lines of force. The unbalanced field of 1257 lines of force per square centimentre in one direction and 1850 in other does not tell us very much in itself. But if we use the information to calculate the field strength over an area which has a harmonic relationship with the unified fields of space, and if the basic information is correct, we should find some mathematical values of great importance. At the time of writing my last book I was not aware of the extreme importance of the values at that stage of accuracy. 1 was close enough to see how they fitted into the equations, but a further fine tuning was necessary to reveal the knowledge locked within these two simple numbers. The basic unit for harmonic calculation is the geodetic inch, or one seventy- two thousandth of a minute of arc; one minute of arc being 6000 geodetic feet. If we take the values 1257 and 1850 lines of force per square centimetre and calculate the field strengths for one squa re geodetic inch, the field density is 8326.71764 and 12255.08864 lines of force respectively. The fields being in oppostion to each other. The combined field density is equal to 20581.80628. Allowing for very slight variations in the conversion factors the difference in field strengths (12255.08864 minus 8326.71764) is equal to 3928.371. We could say that the resultant field densit y one way is equivalent to field 'A' minus field 'B', or 3928.371 lines of force. This value I found to be the harmonic reciprocal of the grid coordinate 2545.584412. The combined field strength of 20581.80628 lines of force can be harmonically associated with several other interesting facts, to he demonstrated in other sections of this book. We can now formulate another equa tion in order to demonstrate the association of the earth's magnetic field with the speed of light. Harmonic equation 2 Field (A — B) = (2C +sqrt(l/2C)) (2C) 2 = 3928.371 harmonic Where C = 144000 — 90.9345139 = 143909.0655 The reduction in light speed of 90.9345139 minutes of arc per grid/sec. creates a very interesting factor, because: 3928371 90.9345139= ------------ 432"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"100 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID The reduction in light speed is therefore equal, in harmonic terms, to the resultant field strength divided by the ra dius of spherical mass. In this case the radius being the distance, in minutes of arc, from the earth's centre to the average height of the atmosphere. ( 432 being a harmonic of 4320 minutes of arc). In my last book, \"The Pulse of the Universe\", I had shown this reduction to be equal to three times the gravity acceleration harmonic as the values matched very closely within the accuracy of my work at that time. The relationship with gravity is st ill there but not so directly obvious. We can now formulate a third equation by inserting the value for the speed of light at the earth's surface. By mathematical conversion this was found to be 143795.77 minutes of arc per grid second, where one grid second was 1/97200 part of the time taken for one revolution of the earth. Harmonic Equation 3 2693645 =sqrt(2C +sqrt(l/2C)) (2C) 2 Where C = 144000 — 204.23 = 143795.77 In my third book 1 had again used the gravity factor as the basis for the reduction, making the value equal to 6G. I feel that this new approach based on extended knowledge is the more correct one, although, as above, the gravity factor is not so obvious. 1 believe that there is yet another factor in the light reduction process to be found bu t this will require further research. The research will be extended until al l the answers are in but the results appear to back up my belief that as the harmonic of light is fractionally decreased, the energy which is released is converted to form physical matter. From this we can get a glimmering of how an unidentified flying object is able to create a series of resonating frequencies which alter the physical properties within and around it, thus causing a change in the space time frames of reference in relation to the earth or other planetary body. As 1 have stated in my previous publications, natural law is not erratic. The universe does not rely on chance to manifest within itself the physical substances which we perceive and call rea lity. A very strict ordered system of mathematical progressions is necessary to create the smallest speck of matter from the primeval matrix of space. During my years of research into the co mplexities of the earth grid system I have gradually built up a picture in my mind of the possible geometric combinations necessary to form matte r from resonating, interlocking wave- forms. Matter and anti-matter are formed by the same wave motions in space. The waves travel through space in a spiralling motion, and alternately pass"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 101 through positive and negative stages. Ma tter is formed through the positive stage, or pulse, and anti-matter through the negative pulse. Each spiral of 360° forms a single pul se. The circular motion of an electron about the nucleus of an atom is therefore an illusion. The relative motion of the nucleus and electrons through space gives the illusion of circular motion. The period during the formation of an ti-matter is comple tely undetectable, since obviously all physical matter is manifesting at the same pulse rate, including any instruments or detector s used to probe atomic structures. The period or frequency rate between each pulse of physical matter creates the measurement which we call time, as well as the speed of light, at the particular position in space of which we are aware, at any given moment. If the frequency rate of positive and ne gative pulses is either increased or decreased, then time and the speed of light vary in direct proportion. This concept would explain time as a geometric, as Einstein theorised it to be. A rough analogy of physical existence can be made by reference to a strip of motion picture film. Each frame or stat ic picture on the film strip may be likened to a single pulse of physical existence. The division between one frame and the next represents a pulse of anti-matter. When viewed as a complete strip, each frame would be seen as a static picture — say one at either end of the strip — then the past and the future can be viewed simultaneously. However, when the film is fed through a projector, we obtain the illusion of motion and the passage of time. The divi sions between the static pictures are not detected by our senses because of the frequency, or speed, of each projection on the movie screen. But by speeding up or slowing down the projector, we can alter the apparent time rate of the actions shown by the film. To continue this analogy: our consciousness is the projector. The conscious T am' part of our individuality passes fr om one pulse of physical matter to the next within the framework of the physical structure which we term our body, thus giving the illusion of constant reality, and the passing of time. It is logical to assume that we ha ve a twin stream of consciousness on the anti-matter side of the cycle, which in fact creates a mirror-image of our own individual personality. (This postulate has already been put forward by scientists). The frequency of manifesta tion of both streams of consciousness, that is, the plus and the minus 'I am ', would position our awareness of the illusion of reality at a particular point in space and time. In other words, if the frequency of pulse manifestation is alte red, even fractionally, our awareness of reality, in the physical sense, will sh ift from one spatial point toanother. In fact, we would travel from one point in space to another without being aware that we had traversed distance in the physical sense. This would be space travel in the truest sense. Lets's look at another analogy: we can consider a simple spiral spring as representing the wave motion of an electron through space. Every second 360° spiral of the spring represents the path of the electron in physical matter, while the opposite ap plies to anti-matter. The theory outlined above explains why light has been described as being caused by both a wave motion and a pulse. Both explanations are correct. "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"102 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID A pulse of light is manifested when the energy level of the atomic structure is altered by outside influences (theory of Max Planck). In the physical plane, the electron of the atomic structure appe ars to jump from its orbit. According to my belief, the electron does not jump orbit. But this is the illusion we obtain, since we are not equipped to perceive the path of the electron during the anti-matter cycle. What actually happens is that the radius of the spiralling motion is increased or decreased in order to absorb or release the energy imparted to, or removed from, the atomic structure. If the energy is imparted, then the electron must extend orbit in or der to maintain balance in the system; and vice versa. Light, or any other radiant energy above or below light frequency, is therefore manifested by undetectable changes in the radius of the spiral motion of the electro n during the anti-matter cycle. If this hypothesis is correct, movement from one point in space to another point, regardless of apparent distance — in other words, true space travel — is completely feasible. By manipulating the frequency rate of the matter-anti- matter cycle, the time and speed of light can be varied in direct proportion to any desired value. All the mathematical evidence amassed so far indicates that the maximum number of individual elements to be found in the universe will be 144. Each of these elements will have, in theory, six isotopes, which will make up a completed table of separate substances numbering 1008. An isotope is an atom of the same element which has a different nuclear mass and atomic weight. Mathematically, the progression woul d create 144 octaves of separate substances giving a theoretical value of 1152. The difference between the total number of substances (1008) and the ha rmonic value in octaves (1152) would be 144, the light harmonic. Once the precipitation of physical ma tter has occured, the buildup of substances takes place according to a very well ordered mathematical sequence. Light-waves, guided seemi ngly by superior intelligence, form intricate interlocking grid patterns which graduate from the simple to the more complex, as the elements from hydrogen at the lower end of the scale, to element 144, come into being. When we think of reality we must think of mass in relation to any physical manifestation, and the smallest particle of physical matter that we are aware of is the electron. Therefore electron ma ss must be the starting point in our quest for a feasible theory to explain the structure of matter. The average radius of action of the electron around th e atomic nucleus must also have a constant harmonic va lue in order to set up a system of expanding spheres which encompass the structure of each element. As the number of protons in the nucleus increa ses with the buildup of each element, the spherical space which houses the electron shell must expand to accommodate an equal number of el ectrons. Although the protons and electrons are nothing more than extremely concentrated wave-forms, we consider them as physical particles in order to build up a picture of our model. As each electron cloud, or shell, expa nds outward from the nucleus, we find that it can accommodate only eight electrons. The shell is then filled up and "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 103 another expansion must take place in or der to form a new shell or harmonic- zone, which again builds up to a ma ximum of eight electrons. As the magnitude of the harmonic resonance intensifies, heavier and heavier elements are produced until we reach a maximum of 144 elements. The light harmonic is then equal and the cycle has been completed. The whole series is a repetition of octaves of wave-form s forming more and more complex structures. In my earlier work I had assumed that the harmonic radius of the atom was equal to the mass ratio of the prot on and electron. I now realize that although I was on the right track, the theoretical mode! demonstrated was partly in error. This necessitated anot her search into the physics books and I now feel that the following calculations based on the experimental values are getting close to the truth. It would be logical to base the harmonic interacti on on the geometric structure of the hydrogen atom. If harm onic equivalents can be derived from the basic values established by experimetal physics, and remain within the laid down tolerances, then almost certain ly a new theory should be evident. Especially if the harmonic values closely match those found in the unified equations previously demonstrated. The distance given between the electron and the proton in the hydrogen atom is approximately 5.3 x 10 -11 metre. (Physics Part 2, Halliday& Resnick) I have discovered that a value of: 5.297493 x 10 -11 metre fits in very neatly wi th the previously established harmonic terms. If we convert this value into its geometric equivalent, then: 5.297493 x 10 -11 metre = 17.15150523 x 10 -11 geodetic feet = 205.8180628 x 10 -11 geodetic inches The radius of the hydrogen atom is therefore very obviously tuned to the harmonic value of 20581.80628, which is the number of magnetic lines of force per square geodetic inch. The diameter of the hydrogen atom would be, 411.6361256. If we calculate the circumference of the atom in terms of harmonic geodetic feet then: 17.15150523 x 10 -11 geodetic feet radius = 34.30301 harmonic diameter = 107.7660 harmonic circumference. Now if we allow spacing on this circumference for eight electron positions we have: 107.7660 divided by 8 = 13.47 units But an electron has only half a spin value; the other half taking place during the anti-matter cycle, so: 13.47 x 2 to allow for the double cycle, = 26.94 Allowing for the accuracy of the conversion factors etc. would make the harmonic geometries of the hydrogen at om comply fairly closely with the geometric energy value derived from the unified equation (2693645). A "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"104 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID comupter program set up for curved geometry should, in theory, show a perfect match. We can now use the hydrogen atom as a base line to form a theory regarding the formation of the complete atomic table of elements. I believe that the harmonic radius of 205.818 0628 units would remain constant throughout the whole range of elements. The orbits of electrons in all substances taking up harmonically spaced positions to the power often. In other words by shifting the decimal point to the right or left of this basic harmonic, the orbital radius of all elec trons can be calculated. (See diagram 5). This would apply to the whole range of 144 elements and their isotopes. Physical reality, as we perceive it, being manifested by the concentrated interlocking of harmonic wave-forms, which are built up progressively from a foundation of fundamental wave-packets. The square of the diameter of the hydrogen atom (4116361257) is equal to the harmonic of mass at the centre of a light field, 1694443. This value also shows up in the cycle of element formation due to the introduction of neutrons into the atomic nucleus. It is stated in the physics books that the maximum number of neutrons that can be contained in the atomic nucleus is 1.6 times the number of protons. The th eory of harmonic formation agrees with this. If the ratio of protons and neut rons in the basic element is taken as 1:1 then as each isotope is built up due to the introduction of neutrons we have the mathematical progression of 1:1, 1:1.1, 1:1.2, 1:1.3, 1:1.4, 1:1.5, 1:1.6, for the element and the six isotopes; then as the harmonic increases to 1:1.694443, and above, towards 1:1.7, we get the fo rmation of the next higher element. The cycle would then repeat itself. The rest mass of the proton is given as 1.67252 x 10 -27 Kg, and a mass ratio of 1836 is laid down for the proton and electron. 1 believe that the harmonic values approach those found in the unifed equations when the atomic structure is accelerated towards the speed of light. According to Einstein the mass increases, and I believe the mass of the proton increases towards the 1694443 harmonic. If the energy level is built up above this point a condition would be reached where a change in phys ical state would occur. That is, the harmonic would be approaching 1.7 to 1.7018, the surface mass harmonic for an atomic structure, and a change would be triggered. A gravitational connection with mass becomes evident when the normal gravitational acceleration is converted into grid equivalents. The physics books state that gravity acceleration varies according to latitude on the earth's surface, and also with altitude, or distance from the centre of the earth. The variation at sea level from 0° to 90° latitude is equal to 32.087829 feet/sec 2 to 32.257711 feet/sec 2 . 1 decided to calculate the grid grav ity acceleration at latitude 52.8756° which is 37.1244° from the geometric po le. The reciprocal harmonic of this position (371244) is equal to 2693645. The interpolated standard gravity acceleration at this latitude is 32.194417 feet/sec : . The grid time factor 1 discovered has stood up to scrutiny over the years and is based on 27 periods for one revolut ion of the earth. Normally we use 24"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 105 periods of one hour each. The 27 periods, I call 27 grid hours. A grid hour is slightly shorter than a normal hour, and is divided into sixty grid minutes, each of which is equal to sixty grid seconds. Therefore for one revolution of the earth we have a standard time of 86,400 seconds as against a grid time of 97 ,200 grid seconds. The ratio is 8:9. So: 32.194417 x 6000 x 8 = 28.24071667 6080 9 If this acceleration factor is multiplied by 6 then: 28.24071667 x 6 = 169.4443 1694443 harmonic = (C +sqrt(1/C)) Where C = 143000 minutes of arc per grid/sec. So harmonically, gravity acceleration is equal to: (C +sqrt(1/C) )/6 At the centre of a light field, forming spherical mass. As my own research has shown me that physical reality is manifested by the harmonic nature of light, it appears logi cal that a vehicle constructed to the principles of harmonics will be requ ired to set up the space-time fields necessary. If this is so, then the first criterion will be that the vehicle must resonate in perfect harmony with the complete table of elements in our physical universe. If it does not, then it would be more than probable that any element or particle of matter not in harmonic resonance within the vehicle structure, or payload, would be left behind when the space-time field was activated. The results would be embarrassing, to say the least! It would be impractical to construct a vehicle made from an alloy of the whole range of 144 elements in the theoretical atomic table. Apart from this, such an alloy is no doubt a physical impossibility. The clue which suggests a method of overcoming this problem is the way matter is built up in octaves of wave-forms. If an octave of elements could be combined, which would set up a resonating field tuned to all the elements in the table, and the unified fields of space then, maybe, we would have a method of crashing the time barrier. I put forward the followin g proposal for consideration. If an octave of elements is the answer let us make a selection from the theoretical table of elements of 144. If we divide 144 by 8 we get divisions of 18 units, therefore we will select each of the elements we require, 18 units part, as follows: Atomic number 18: argon Atomic number 36: crypton Atomic number 54: xenon Atomic number 72: hafnium Atomic number 90: thorium Atomic number 108: X Atomic number 126: Y UNDISCOVERED ELEMENTS Atomic number 144: Z Total number 648 "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"106 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID It can be seen that the total harmonic value of the atomic numbers of the combined elements is 648. The square root of this number is 25.45584412, the harmonic of which is found in the polar sections of the world grid.

According to a pair of very nervous waitresses, the Shore Patrol had arrived first and cleared the place out - but not before two of the sailors involved allegedly did a disappearing act. \"They just sort of vanished into thin air. . . right there,\" reported one of the frightened hostesses, \"and I ain't been drinking either!\" At that point, according to her account, the Shore Patrol proceeded to hustle everyone out of the place in short order.

Damage to the tavern was estimated to be in the vicinity of six hundred dollars. "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"112 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID The \"Philadelphia Experiment\" is the name that has commonly been given to an alleged Top-Secret experiment conducted by the United States Navy in 1943 in which the Destroyer Escort U.S.S. Eldridge, outfitted with several tons of specialized electronics equi pment capable of creating a tremendous pulsating magnetic fi eld around itself, was first made invisible and then transported, in a matter of moments, from the Philadelphia Navy Yard, to the Norfolk Docks and back again, a total dist ance of over 400 miles (640 kilometers). The United States government for the last 43 years has officially denied that this experiment ever took place. Challenging this statement, however, are several unanswered questions: What caused the death of some of the crew members aboard ship in a safe and secu re harbor? Why was the remainder of the crew discharged as medi cally unfit? If one concludes that the Philadelphia Experiment did really occur, then was the untimely death of an in dependent researcher investigating the alleged experiment really su icide? How could the Navy possibly accomplish such a fantastic experiment? In any case, the story begins with Morris Ketc hum Jessup, an astronomy and mathematics Professor at t he University of Michigan. Morris Ketchum Jessup was born in Rock ville, Indiana, March 20, 1900 and named after his uncl e, a railroad and financial baron (who also had a Cape in the northernmost tip of Greenland named after him). In the late 1920s while a Doctorate student at the University of Michigan, the young Jessup's research was responsible for the discovery of many physical double stars now catalogued by the Royal Astronomical Society of London. While the country was in the firm grip of the Depression and jobs were hard to find, Jess up, like so many other highly technical people, took work wher ever he could. He was first assigned by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to go to the Amazon to study sources of crude rubber. From there he became a photographer on an archaeo logical expedition to the Mayan ruins in Central America. Then Jessup went to Peru to study pre-lncan culture. It wa s in Peru that Jessup, after studying these massive ruins wit h their incredible exactness and implicit construction skills, speculated that they could have been built only with the aid of levitating devices from sky ships of some sort. This t heory places Jess up among the first "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 113 of modern scientists to believe in the \"Ancient Astronauts\" theory. This view, naturally, did not put him in high regard among his employers and colleagues, and he was soon on his own. Jessup continued his research at his own expense. He found some very interesting craters in Mexico that were similar in structure and type to the mysterious craters on the Moon. Further research disclosed that the United States Air Force had highly classified photos of the Mexican craters. Running out of money, Jessup returned to the U.S. in 1954 to raise funds for further research. When the flying-saucer craze ran rampant in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Jessup became interested, first casually, and then quite seriously. His major focus was the possible propulsion power for these sky ships. From what he had learned in Central America, Mexico, and Peru, Jessup was convinced that UFOs were a real possibility, and he had enough foundation to prove it. Jessup moved to Washington, D.C. and devoted the next year to extensive research. On January 13, 1955, he gave his publisher the completed manuscript of his book, The Case for the UFO. The book sold well enough such that in the fall of 1955 Bantam issued a paperback edition. Shortly after this book was published, Jessup received a most unusual letter. It was written in several different colors of ink and the spelling and punctuation were most odd. The subject of the letter, however, was even stranger than its grammatical oddities. The correspondent, a Mr. Allende (who signed his letters \"Carl Allen\") was markedly interested in Jessups' ideas about levitation and went to great lengths to agree with Jessups' theory-—that many of our megaliths were built using the technique of levitation. In fact, he assured Jessup that levitation was not only scientifically possible but was commonplace on Earth in our recent past. Jessup was so fascinated by the style of the letter and the agreement with his own theory that he wrote back to Allende asking for more details. These events concurred with several other pressing matters. At this time Jessup was doing the publicity and lecture circuit and was also preparing his second book, The UFO and the Bible. He soon forgot about the mysterious letter. During the next year Jessup pushed for research into the unified field theory, something Einstein had worked on during the last twenty years of his life. It was this consuming interest that brought the \"Philadelphia Experiment\" back into the limelight. On January 13, 1956, exactly one year after his "},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 115 first book was published, Morris Ketchum Jessup received the following letter. (Editor's Note : It is reprinted here exactly as Jessup received it. This letter contains many typographical errors and odd capitalizations of certain words; these have not been corrected, as they contain a significant part of the key to the whole matter. However a few new paragraphs have been made in the long text to aid readability) My Dear Dr. Jessup, Your invocation to the Public that they move en Masse upon their Representatives and have thusly enough Pressure placed at the right & sufficient Number of Places where from a Law demanding Research into Dr. Albert Eienstiens Unified Field Theory May be enacted (1925-1927) is Not at all Necessary. It May Intrest you to know that The Good Doctor Was Not so Much influenced in his retraction of that Work, by Mathematics, as he most assuredly was by Humantics. His Later computations, done strictly for his own edification & amusement, upon cycles of Human Civilization & Progress compared to the Growth of Mans General over-all Character Was enough to Horrify Him. Thus, we are told today that the Theory was \"Incomplete.\" Dr. B. Russell asserts privately that It is complete. He also says that Man is Not Ready for it & Shan't be until after W.W. III. Nevertheless, \"Results\" of My friend Dr. Franklin Reno, were used. These Were a complete Recheck of That Theory, With a View to any & Every Possible quick use of it, if feasible in a Very short time. There Were good Results, as far as a Group Math Re-Check AND as far as a good Physical \"Result,\" to Boot. YET, THE NAVY FEARS TO USE THIS RESULT.

Beyond that certain extent No Person in his right senses, or having any senses at all, Will evermore dare to go. I am sorry that I Mislead You in My Previous Missive.

Any person without that sphere could see Nothing save the clearly Defined shape of the Ships Hull in the Water.

I leave it up to you to Decide if further work shall be put into this or Not, and Write this in Hopes there Will be. Very Sincerely, Carl M. Allen So here was a mysterious correspondence from a man who talked like he knew intimately about levitation, disappearing ships, and invisible men. He wrote in different color inks and with a style of writing that would not win any good grades anywhere. Jessup, meanwhile, was being pushed around by his agents in New York to run the publicity circuit and to get a new book out while the interest was still hot on his last one. But all he wanted was to make some cash and get back to those craters in Mexico. It would have been easy to just forget the whole Allende matter, but Jessup sent him a postcard asking for more details and five months later he received the following reply. (Once again, this is reprinted as it was received by Jessup) Dear Mr. Jessup: Having just recently gotten home from my long travels around the country I find that you had dropped me a card. You ask that I write you \"at once\" and So after taking everything into consideration, I have decided to do so. You ask me for what is tantamount to positiv e proof of something that only the duplication of those devices that produced \"This Phenomenon\" could ever give you. At least, were I of scientific bent, I presume that, were I of Such a Curiosity about something, the which has been produced from a theory t hat was discarded (1927) as incomplete, I am sure that I woul d be of such dubiousness towards that I would Have to be shown those devices that produced such a curious interaction of Forces & Fields, in operation & their product. Mr. Jessup, I could NEVER possibly satisfy such an attitude. The reason being that I could not, Nor ever would the Navy Research Dept. (Then under the pres ent Boss of the Navy, Burke) ever let it be known that any such thing was ever allowed to be done. For you see, It was because of Burkes Curiosity & Willingness & prompting that this experiment was enabled to be carried out. It proved a White-elephant but His attitude towards advanced & ultra-advanced types of research is just \"THE\" THING that put him where he is today. (O r at least, to be sure, it carries a great weight). Were the stench of such an Experiments results ever to come out, He would be crucified. However, I have noticed, that throo the ages, those who have had this happen to them, once the vulgar passions that caused the reaction have cooled-off AND further research OPENLY carried"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"122 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID on, that these crucified ones achieve something akin to Saint hood. You say that this, \"is of the greatest importance\". I disagree with you Mr. Jessup, not just whole Heartedly, but vehemently. However at the same time, your ideas & your own sort of curiosity is that of mine own sort and besides my disagreement is based upon philosophical Morality and not upon that curiosity which Drives Science so rapidly. I can be of some positive help to you in myself but to do so would require a Hypnotist, Sodium Pentathol, a tape recorder & an excellent typist-secretary in order to produce material of Real value to you. As you know one who is hypnotized cannot Lie and one who is both hypnotized AND given \"Truth Serum\" as it is colloqually known, COULD NOT POSSIBLY LIE, AT ALL To boot, My Memory would be THUS enabled to remember things in such great detail, things that my present consciousne ss cannot recall at all, or only barely and uncertainly that it w ould be of far greater benifit to use hypnosis. I could thus be enabled to not only Recall COMPLETE names, but also addresses & telephone numbers AND perhaps the very important Z numbers of those sailors whom I sailed with them or even came into contact with. I could too, being something of a Dialectician, be able to thusly talk exactly as these witnesses talked and imitate or illustrate their Mannerisms & Habits of thought, thus your psychologists can figure IN ADVANCE the Surefire method of dealing Mo st Sucessfully with these. I could NOT do this with someone with whom I had not observed at length & these men, I lived with for about 6 months, so you are bound to get good to excellent results. The mind does NOT ever forget, Not really, As you know. Upon this I suggest this way of doing this with Myself but further, the Later usage of My self in Mannerisms & Thought pattern illustration is suggested in or der that the Goal of inducing these Men to place themselves at & under your disposal (HYPNOTICALLY OR UNDER TRUTH-SERUM) is a Goal, the Which could Have Far greater impact, due to co-relation of Expieriences remembered Hypnotically by Men who have not seen or even written to each other, at all, for Nearly or over TEN years. In this, with such Men as Witnesses, giving irrefuttable testimony It is my belief that were, Not the Navy, but the Airforce, confronted with such evidence, (IE Chief of Research) there would be either an uproar or a quiet and determined effort to achieve SAFELY \"that which\" the Navy failed at. They did NOT fail to, I hope you realize, achieve Metalic & organic invisibility nor did they fail to, unbesoughtedly, acheive transportation of thousands of tons of Metal & Humans at an eyes blink speed. Even though this latter effect of prolonged experimentation was (to them) The thing that caused them to consider the experiment as a failure, I BELIEVE THAT FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WOULD NATURALLY HAVE PRODUCED CONTROLLED TRANSPORT OF GR EAT TONNAGES AT ULTRAFAST SPEEDS TO A DESIRED POINT THE INSTANT IT IS DESIRED throo usage of an area covered by: (1) those cargoes and (2) that \"Field\" that could cause those goods, Ships or Ship parts (MEN WERE TRANSPORTED AS WELL) to go to another Point.

You would Need a Dale Carneigie to Maneuever these folks into doing just as you wish. It would be cheaper t han paying everyone of all these witnesses & Much more Ethical.

I would like to find where it is that these Sailors live NOW. It is known that some few people can somehow tell you a mans name & His Home address UNDER HYPNOSIS EVEN THOUGH NEVER HAVING MET OR SEEN THE PERSON. These folks have a very high or just a high PSI factor in their make-up that can be intensified under stress or strain OR that usually is intensified under extreme fright.

My reasons are simply to enable more work to be done upon this \"Field Theory,\" I am a star-gazer Mr. Jessup. I make no bones about this and the fact that I feel that IF HANDLED PROPERLY, I.E. PRESENTED TO PEOPLE & SCIENCE IN THE PROPER PSCHOLOGICALLY EFFECTIVE MANNER, I feel sure that Man will go where He now dreams of being—to the stars via the form of transport that the Navy accidentally stumbled upon (to their embarrassment) when their EXP. SHIP took off & popped-up a minute or so later on several Hundred sea travel-trip miles away at another of its berths in Cheasapeake Bay area. I read of this in another newspaper & only by Hypnosis could any Man remember all the details of which paper, date of occurance & etc., you see? Eh. Perhaps already, the Navy has used this accident of transport to build your UFO's. It is a lo gical advance from any standpoint. What do you think ?? One could conclude from the beginning of the letter that Jessup had asked for some specific hard cold facts. He could even have been looking for the actual equipment design. What he got back as an answer was: \"I can't give you those things, but how about truth serum and hy pnosis?\" Allen's answer was too fantastic to believe a nd since he provided no new information, Jessup disregarded these le tters as ramblings from a crazy person with a fondness for UFOs. There wasn't anything else to do. Jessup was too busy raising capital to return to Mexico and resume his gr and passion—those mysterious craters— than to pursue some crackpot talking about invisible ships and men. Ho wever, there were events happening elsewhere that would soon bring this fantastic story back into Jessup's life. In late July or ear ly August a copy of The Case for the UFO arrived at the Office of Naval Research (O.N.R .). However, this was not an ordinary copy. It had been sent to Admiral N. Furth in a manila envelope and across the front of it had been scribbled \"Happy Easter\". The book itself was well worn and contained handwritten comments at the top, bottom and margins of the pages. The comme nts were written in three different colors of ink as if the book had been passed back and "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 125 forth between three people. The comments suggested a knowledge of UFOs, their method of propulsion, and the origin and background of the beings operating them. The book at that time fell into the possession of Major Darrell L. Ritter (U.S.M.C. Aeronautical Project Officer at O.N.R.) who took a great interest in these comments. It was obvious that a great deal of time and effort had been put into this book. Major Ritter was also aware of the government's momentary interest in anti-gra vity research, and felt that the comments about undersea cities built by two groups of extra-terrestrials (called the LMs and SMs) were quite intriguing. There were explanations for mysterious ship and plane disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle. Also included was an extensive commentary on the origins of odd storms and clouds, of objects falling from the sky, of strange marks and footprints that Jessup had written about, and many odd words (such as: \"mothership\", \"home ship\", \"dead ship\", \"great ark\", \"great bombardment\", \"great return\", \"great war\", \"little men\", \"force fields\", \"deep freeze\", \"measure markers\", \"scout ships\", \"magnetic fields\", \"gravity fields\", \"sheets of diamonds\", \"cosmic rays\", \"force cutters\", \"inlay work\", \"clear talk\", \"telepathing\", \"nodes\", \"vortices\", and \"magnetic net\") that were used throughout the book and which might be of some value for later research. Afterwards, Major Ritter passed the book on to two other O.N.R. officers, Commander George W. Hoover (Special Projects Officer) and Captain Sidney Sherby. These men were intimately involved in the Navy's Project Vanguard, the code name for the U.S. effort to develop the first artificial earth satellite. Commander Hoover and Captain Sherby, reviewing the book, and the mysterious comments within it, invited Jessup to come to O.N.R. and discuss his book. By this time it was the spring of 1957 and 18 months had passed since the book had first arrived at the O.N.R. As Jessup read the annotated book he reportedly became more and more distressed, because the comments referred to subjects he had heard about but which had not been mentioned in his writings. The person or persons who had written these comments had a good understanding of the current \"myths\" of UFOs, extraterrestrials, and other subjects mainly the concern of psychics, cultists and mystics. Jessup became confused as to why the United States governmentwas so interested in the scribblings from such an apparently cluttered mind. As he read further he came across a comment concerning a secret Navy experiment in 1943 and immediately he knew who had been responsible for the crazed and disjointed comments. "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"126 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID Jessup then shared his discovery with the Naval Officers and they in turn asked if the O.N.R. could have the letters. Next they informed Jessup that a special edition of his book was being produced by them and it would include all the additions. Jessup consented to the new edition and made three additional trips to the O.N.R. concerning this matter. Shortly after these meetings Jessup was involved in a car accident. At the same time he began experiencing marital difficulties; close friends say he was never quite the same after that. He seemed quite disturbed by the Navy experience and after receiving the promised copies of his own book he spent considerable time adding his own comments. Hoover and Shelby would, in the days to come, make many attempts to find the elusive Allende (Carl Allen) but with no success. Jessup was still confused as to why the Na vy was so intere sted in this matter, and spent considerable time researching the details of the operation known as the \"Philadelphia Experiment\". In the meantime all his efforts to get back to Mexico had come up blank, and he now devoted himself to writing and publishing. He moved back to his native Indiana and started publishing a small astrologica l journal. During October of 1958, Jessup left Indiana for New York on publishing business and around the 31st paid a visit to a friend, Ivan T. Sanderson, founder of the Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained (S.I.T.U.). Over dinner Jessup gave Sanderson the copy of the book he had been making notes in; Jessup, being visibly disturbed, asked Sanderson in great sincerity to read it and then lock it up for safe keeping—\"In case anything should happen to me.\" Jessup was scheduled to return to Indiana within a few days. When he failed to return, his publisher became concerned and contacted one of Jessups' associates concerning his whereabouts. His associate related that he had no information. Six weeks after his New York departure Jessup, was located in Florida; apparently, he had gone there from New York and had been involved in another major car accident from which he was still recovering. Jessup, during those next months, was in terrible spirits. His publishe r rejected his manuscripts as being \"not up to par.\" His writings were drawing considerable criticism from all around the country. On April 20, 1959, two years after meeting with the O.N.R., Jessup was found dead in his car close to his Florida home: a victim of carbon-monoxide poisoning. A hose had been attached to his car exhaust and passed into the passenger side window. Jessup had killed himself. Or had he? Jessup's death has"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 127 been the subject of substantial speculation. Some of his friends have said that Jessup was not the type to kill himself. Others have suggested he was murdered when he refused to abandon his UFO research. Rumors were then circulating about the \"Men In Black\", the name given to government agents who allegedly visited several UFO researchers and \"persuaded\" them to cease and desist their work. Other friends said that Jessup was depressed about personal problems and that he had sent a suicide note to a close friend. However, the handwriting was not checked to see if it matched with Jessup's. The truth about Morris K. Jessup will probably never be known, placing him in that same file cabinet along with Karen Silkwood, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and other humans regarding whom certain factions in our society would have an easier time of things if they were invisible or dead. So we might ask, Did the Navy really make a Destroyer-class ship disappear and transport itself over four hundred miles of ocean in a matter of moments, or is this just some fantastic story? And if this is not just a story, why did they do it? We know by the results why the Navy might have wanted to keep things quiet. Governmental cover-ups are not new; they seem to come with the institution. Maybe we can reach a conclusion more easily if we learn more about the last day of Jessup's life. Dr. J. Manson Valentine, an oceanographer, archaeologist, and zoologist, had been a friend of Jessups' for the last fourteen years of his life while he resided in Florida. Jessup, as we know, was very upset during the last months of his life and was reaching out more than ever to talk with someone. Dr. Valentine was that someone. It was during these last months that Jessup shared his innermost feelings about the Philadelphia Experiment with him. It's very probable that Dr. Valentine was the last person to talk with Jessup. He had spoken to Jessup on April 20, 1959, and had invited Jessup to dinner; Jessup accepted his invitation, but never showed up. When asked, \"Why do you think Jessup killed himself?\", Dr. Valentine's answer was: \"If he committed suicide it was probably due to extreme depression. He had been approached by the Navy to continue working on the Philadelphia Experiment or similar projects, but had declined, as he was worried about its dangerous ramifications... Perhaps he could have been saved. He was still alive when he was found .... Perhaps he was allowed to die.\" Dr. Valentine went on to say that Jessup had researched the question of the Philadelphia Experiment, \"pretty thoroughly. You must remember that he was not a crank writer, but a distinguished and famous scientist.\" "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"128 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID Dr. Valentine remembers Jessu p relating some strange things he had learned concerni ng the Navy's ex periment. Jessup said the invisibility effect had been accomplished by using magnetic field generators, called degaussers, which were \"pulsed\" at resonant freque ncies to create a huge magnetic field around the Destroyer. In Dr. Valentine's opinion Jessup was well informed of the alleged experiment and had met with the Navy officers and scientists several times. He had said to Dr. Valentine: \"The experiment is very interesting but awfully dangerous. It is too har d on the people involved. This use of magnetic resonance is tantamount to temporary obliteration in our dimension but it tends to get out of control. Actually, it is equivalent to a transference of matter into another level or dimension, and could represent a dimensional breakthrough if it were possible to control it.\" According to Valentine, Jessup believed he was \"on the verge of discovering the scien tific basis for whatever was happening.\" Jessup explained: \"An electric field created in a coil induces a magnetic field at right angles to the first, and each of these fields represents one plane of space. But since there are three planes of space, there must be a third field, perhaps a gravitational one. By hooking up electromagnetic generators so as to produce a magnetic pulse it might be possible to produce this third field through the principle of resonance.\" Jessup thought the Navy had discovered this by accident. This brings up the interest ing possibility of a fourth dimension. It is known, by abs tract mathematics, that it is possible to have as many as fi fteen dimensions. If they exist as a mathematical concept, they exist in fact (according to Pythagoras). It is a widely held belief among scientists that basic atomic structure is essent ially electric in nature rather than material. A vast interplay of energies is involved. This concept gives us grea t flexibility in vis ualizing the universe such that if multiple phases of matter don't exist it would be quite surprising. The transition from one phase (our world), to another world would be equivalent to the pa ssage from one plane of existence to another in a sort of interdim ensional metamorphosis. It is a case of worlds within worlds. Magnetism is thought to be the key factor in the control of these dimensional changes. Magnetism is the only phenomenon for which scientists have no mechanical explanation . We can visualize electrons travelling along a wire to create electric current, and we can envision waves of different frequencies to create heat, light and radio. "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 129 But a magnetic field defies mechanical interpretation. In addition, when UFOs do their materializations/dematerial- izations, intense magnetic disturbances are always present. With these thoughts in mind let's see how the concept of a \"World Grid\" could be a key factor in the location and function of the alleged Philadelphia Experiment. The Philadelphia Experiment is fantastic because it disturbs our sense of what we think exists in a particular time and space. And when we speak of space and time, we invariably think of Einstein. Jessup believed Einstein's theories held the key to UFO propulsion; after all, Carl Allen had confirmed that it not only was the key but full scale research and experimentation of Einstein's mysterious mathematical concepts was already a reality. Researching Naval employment records we find that Albert Einstein was hired as a Scientist for the Office of Naval Research (O.N.R.) on May 31, 1943, a post he maintained until June 30, 1944. Also on July 24, 1943, Einstein met with Naval Officers in his Princeton study—just three months prior to the Philadelphia Experiment. One way to cross the tremendous distances of space would be to alter the structure of space itself. This could be accomplished by modifying the space-time geometric matrix. It is this matrix that gives us the illusion of form and distance. One method of changing the matrix is through the modification of frequencies controlling the matter-antimatter cycles. These in turn control our perceptions of things existing in apparent space-time. Einstein's premise is that time is a geometric concept; therefore, if this could be altered, then all of the universe would become available to us at any single moment. In one second we could travel great distances, for at that point distance would be revealed as an illusion. According to a prevalent view, Time is the factor that keeps objects apart in space. With the possibility of mo ving from place to place in what is called \"Zero Time\", then both places exist in the same place according to our perception. By speeding up the geometric of time we are able to bring distant objects closer together. This is the secret of extra-terrestrial spacecraft; they travel by altering the space dimension by bringing time to zero. Einstein believed that physical matter was nothing more than a concentrated field of force. What we see visually as a physical substance is in actuality a combination (or four-dimensional matrix) of frequencies. Different frequencies combine in different ways thus creating different physical masses. These masses seem solid to us because we are also "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" Position A: Theoretical experimental site in the vicinity of the Philadelphia College of Science.

In the famous equation E = MC 2 , M, the value for mass, can be replaced by a value representing a specific waveform. According to Bruce Cathie's mathematics of the world grid, the substituted term is a function of the velocity of Light. Einstein E=MC 2 Cathie grid M=C+sqrt(1/C) Therefore E=(C+sqrt(1/C)) C 2 (Harmonic equation 1) Within this unified field equation, expressed in terms of pure electromagnetic energy, lies the key to the universe: the whole of existence, the seen and unseen, forms, solids, liquids and gases, the stars and the blackness of space itself. All is perceived 'to consist of visible and invisible waves of light. All of creation is Light. The earth is simply a huge magnet wound with magnetic lines of force. The coils are 1,725 cm 2 in one direction and 1,850 cm 2 in the other. These lines of force form a grid pattern due to the spin of our planet. At any given point there are a trillion lines of force crossing and creating small vortices. Each vortex manifests as an atomic structure and creates within itself a gravitational field. The gravitational field is nothing more than the effect of relative motion in space. Matter is drawn towards a gravitational field, just as a piece of wood is drawn into a whirlpool. The gravitational fields created by the vortexual action of every atom combine to form the complete field of our planet Earth. The lattice matrix of the world grid is the natural grid formed by these interlocking lines of force. (Editor's Note : Actually, the magnetic field density at the surface of the Earth, in gauss, is approximately 0.5 lines per cm 2 ) The basic unit for harmonic calculation in relation to this grid is the geodetic inch, or 0.172 minutes of arc, one minute of arc being 6,000 geodetic feet. By taking the values of 1,725 and 1,850 per cm 2 and calculating the field strengths for one square geodetic inch, the field density is found to be 8,326.71764 and 12,255.08864, respectively. When the fields are in opposition, the combined field density is 20,581.80628 "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE PANTAGRAPH, Thursday, Aug. 21, 1986 A5 "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"134 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID for one square geodetic inch. The difference in field strengths is calculated to be 12,255.08864 minus 83,26.71764 which equals 3,928.371. From this we can say that the resultant field density one way is field A minus field B or 3,928.371 lines of force per cm 2 . This value is the reciprocal of 1/2 the distance of the polar grid square size. We can now formulate another equation in order to demonstrate the association of the Earth's magnetic field with the speed of light. Please note that 144,000 is a speed of light harmonic value in free space. The figure of 143,900 minutes of arc grid per second will be explained below. The reduction in the speed of light is equal in harmonic terms to the resultant field strength divided by the radius of the spherical mass. In this case the radius is equivalent to the distance in minutes of arc, from the Earth's center to the average height of the atmosphere (432 being a harmonic of 4,320 minutes of arc). We can now generate another equation by inserting the value for the speed of light at the Earth's surface. By mathematical conversion this was found to be 143,795.77 minutes of arc per grid second, where one grid second was 1/972,000 part of the time taken for one revolution of the Earth.

You wouldn't think that the universe would leave to chance the physical stuff we call reality. As Einstein once said, \"God does not play dice with t h e uni verse!\"---i nvisi bl e ships, disappearing men, reality, notwithstanding. . . . Bruce Cathie has spent considerable time studying the latitudes and longitudes of the Philadelphia and Norfolk Navy Yards in a search for the two points that were harmonically correct for the movement across space-time. The latitude of the Philadelphia Naval Base, namely, 39° 56' 35.77\" North, set up a prime harmonic of the speed of light, which was 143,795.77 seconds of arc. It is an interesting coincidence that the College of Science was established at this latitude. This latitude is equivalent to 143,795.77 seconds of arc North. The latitude in the Norfolk area is 36° 55' 08\" North.

The circular area swept out by a wave of this radius would harmonically be equal to n. The latitudinal displacement is 181.452266 minutes of arc. The square root of this number equals 13.47042, which is a harmonic of the electron spacing in the atomic nucleus. The longitudinal spacing would equal 1.1803288 degrees. The reciprocal of this number is 0.8472215; when doubled this number yields the 1.694443 harmonic. "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Another interesting coincidence exists here. Line B-C in the diagram is very close to and parallel with grid line #18 on the Becker-Hagens world grid system (See their chapter \"The Planetary Grid: A New Synthesis,\" above). This line connects the Philadelphia docks and the Norfolk docks with the Bermuda Triangle. Could it be that the vessel in its dematerialized state was actually on this grid line? Could it be that the energy that makes all this possible is a magnetic field transmitted at the correct frequency by the powerful field generators aboard the ship? Maybe it is true that the Navy scientists didn't expect what resulted from their unique experiment; maybe, in fact, the results were terribly counter to the desired effects. If indeed the goal had been just to make the ships invisible to radar (similar to modern day Stealth systems), or to magnetically repel torpedos, perhaps instead the Navy found something of much greater import than anyone had ever imagined. It seems to me that the experiment was just that—an experiment. We will never know what the true purpose of this experiment was. The purpose of the last experiment in the series was most likely the actual transport of the ship, a possibility the Navy might have learned of through earlier tests. But originally they were looking for radar invisibility or a magnetic torpedo/mine shield.

That same master Grid engineer, the Gods' messenger for Earth, later passed the flame of his mastery, for our time, to the Archangel Michael with his solar initiatory sword. Michael, say the Hebrews, is the Keeper of the Secrets of the Relations between Heaven and Earth—the nurturing bond of geomancy. The message of both Hermes and Michael to us today as neophyte Grid engineers is this: The Grid is the paramount spiritual phenomenon of Earth. Our Ariadne's thread out of this bewildering maze of physical life on Earth is the ley line. The rediscovery of ley lines in this century is only a fragment, however, of the eventual unveiling of the secrets of Nature. Ley lines are the luminous strands that many are pulling at today, hardly suspecting what riches lie at the end of these subtle light lines. All ley lines lead to the planetary Grid, the primary light and energy matrix, creating, enveloping, and maintaining planet Earth, our Gaia. The Grid has been variously described by poets and clairvoyants in recent times. Ley lines are \"the radial threads on a spider's web.\" 1 Ley lines form the \"focal points in a vast multilayered cobweb somewhat reminiscent of a micrograph of nerve cells and their ganglia\" as \"the circulation and nervous system of the body of earth.\" 2 The Grid is \"a geometrically precise web\" punctuated with \"Grids of Light, focal points,\" a \"receptor web complex with nexi of entrance.\" 3 The British novelist Doris Lessing writes intimately of the Grid as \"the enclosing web of subtle light (that) touched the earth globe...All over the globe ran these pulses or lines\" which make \"a colored spinning membrane\" and \"a great web of patterning oscillations and quiverings.\" 4 A personal acquaintance of mine in England summed it up lucidly: \"I saw the Earth as a fishnet web of light lines. My body was the same, and there were lines of light radiating from the intersections of the planet's surface to link with the web network surrounding other planets.\" The Hermetic Keys to the planetary Grid are inscribed on the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"142 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID Messenger's mythical Emerald Tablets, which summarise the 7 Hermetic Principles underlying all manifestation. These are the keys to Hermes' Geomancy: The Principle of Mentalism (The Universe is Mental, the All is Infinite Mind, which is the fundamental reality and the womb of all universes). The Principle of Correspondence (Whatever is Below is like unto that which is Above, and whatever is Above is like that which is Below, to accomplish the miracles of The One). The Principle of Vibration (Nothing rests; everything moves and vibrates). The Principle of Polarity (Everything is dual, has poles, and pairs of opposites). The Principle of Rhythm (Everything has its tides, its rise and fall, its equal pendulum swings to the right and left, its peaks and troughs). The Principle of Causation (Every effect has its Cause, every Cause has its Effect, all proceeding by Law, never by chance). The Principle of Gender (Everything has its \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" aspects). 5 Experiential knowledge of Hermes' principles through meditative interfacing with the Earth Grid leads us into the secrets of geomancy. The Grid is not something out there , away from us, safely, abstractly separate from our daily lives. Our molecular bodies and human consciousness as we walk on Earth live within the Grid. The Grid is like a unified tuning fork vibrating with our Light/Life/Electromagnetic spectrum for Earth as we receive it daily from our specific Star Evolution paradigm, the Sun, the astrophysical center of our local solar system Grid. Our King Sun is an evolving star, and our lives as humans on Earth are breathed within the Grid-mediated parameters of \"His\" body, our familiar solar system. The Grid is the forgotten nexus between humankind, as embodied, Earth-walking consciousness, and the starry heavens. The Grid is the spiritual link for the blending of cosmic and terrestrial energies in the consciousness experiment known as Humanity; it is the pervasive means for the harmonious fusion of the energies of the solar system in human consciousness. The Grid actually predates physical Earth and is more like Mother Gaia's exterior skeletal energy structure, her prototypal design and predetermined matrix of energy and light from which her physical body was manifested. Our relations as embodied humans with the Star Evolution we call the Sun is mediated through the Grid enveloping Earth. The key word here is homologous. The human body is conical, rectangular, while the Earth's body is spherical; yet Hermes speaks truthfully when he says, As Above, So Below. What exists in Heaven is embodied on Earth and in the Human but in specific manners appropriate to the morphology. This is "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 143 the meaning of \"equal Logos\" (hom o-logous),i.e., t he same Word. Just as the human has an in tricate subway system of acupuncture meridians, carrying ch'i, the life force, so has the Earth a myriad weblike matrix of ley lines a nd focal points, Geomancy and somamancy are two more pivotal Grid-explicating words. Geomancy initially means \"divination of the Earth's secrets\" (From the Greek, Gaia-mantos), but after a meditative experience with the planetary Grid, the word emerges for us into it s larger m eaning as \"divinization of the Earth,\" because positive, lo ving human consciousness interfacing with the Heaven-be stowed Grid completes its intended divinization process. Somamancy (Greek: body-mantos) is the equivalent word operating in the human dimension. As we breathe medi tatively with Love from Above, which is the fundamental ener gy behind light and matter, at focal points on the Grid, not only do we bring the Earth's light lines into clarity, we manife st our own inherent divinity, perceive our own bodily ley lines, and come to embody, knowingly, somamantic ally, this inseverable nexus between the Earth, cosmos, and human. Another name for this nexus is the Grid. Thus geomancy and somamancy are two sides of the same coin. When we harmonise and enlighten geo, we do reciprocally the same for soma. Eastern esoteric yoga informs us that the human has not only the apparent physical body, bu t a series of overlapping, multidimensional bodies which form a kind of Jacob's Ladder away from the familiar body of bones and flesh into the Body of Light. These bodies are variously described according to different traditions, but essentially they include the etheric/electromagnet ic body (seat of the meridians and chakras), the emotional body (or astral body, the basic formative dimension for emotions as polarised expressions), the mental body (the sphere of abstract knowledge and concrete thinking, the realm of Forms), and the causal body (seat of the Soul, the timeless, spiritualized agent behind sequential human incarnations). These 5 Bodies form an inter penetrating consciousness grid, like a series of Chinese boxes, or like the layers of an onion, with always another inside. The Ea rth, similarly, has this multidimensional overlay of gr id bodies. This convenient, linear abstraction of what is indi visible, whole, simultaneous, and synchronous, is non etheless useful as a model in explaining the different functional aspects of the planetary Grid. Thus we begin with an examination of Gaia's 5 Grid Bodies.

This body vitali ses and energises the physical. It is the clearinghouse for all in-coming energy fields and transmits them intelligently to the organic body matrices (organs or power points). It is the channel for physically-focussed consciousne ss to register the subtle worlds of energy and influence. Through the electromagnetic body course the acupuncture meridians, the yin (n egative, feminine) and yang (positive, masculine) polarised channels for the \"two breaths of ch'i,\" the pervasive life energy, as catalo gued by the ancient Chinese. These meridians traverse the ph ysical Earth and human body in an intricate though rationally precise matrix, visually resembling something like the New York City subway system at its most obtuse (Diagram 1). Acupuncturists speak of 10 organ-related (and 2 affiliate) channels, 15 Luo that connect these major meridians, the 8 St range Flow channels, the 12 muscle meridians—such that as many as 59 \"rivers of ch'i \" are documented in advanced Ch inese medical texts, with a minimum of 365 treatment points (or subway stops) but with up to 1000 points pote ntially available and sometimes used. Correspondingly the venerable Chinese geomancers, practicing feng shui, the elusive landscape science of \"wind and water\", delineated the terrestrial lung mei (\"dragon paths\" or ley lines) which flowed either as a white yang tiger in the high mountains or as a yin blue dr agon in the low hills and valleys. Where the two lung mei (the \"two breaths of ch'i\" ) met and became one, this was a pow er point node, full of ch'i and suitable for a royal grave or temple. The masters of feng shui then intelligently placed their acupuncture \"needles of stone\" at these key power fusion poi nts to clarify, harmonise, energise, and distribute the terrestrial ch'i in the Grid in accordance with daily, weekly, mo nthly, seasonal, and yearly calendars—which is precisely what the acupuncturist does with her assortment of tiny needl es and treatment maps of the human body. This is our conceptual background for entering the Electromagnetic 1746 Grid. The fi rst key aspect of this grid is"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"146 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID the treatment nodes, or power points, in the meridian system. These have been variously described by \"Earth Mysteries\" writers as energy cells, coordination points, exit points, energy vortices, time portals, subtle digestive systems. A more accurate name is domes because this clearly, though controversially, reflects the origin and purpose of these landscape energy centers. There is on the Earth, state proponents of the Dome theory, a system of dome centers, or etheric energy canopies, occupying the space over sacred enclosures (creating them, in fact), f r o m which extend numerous short-distance straight-running and spiralling dome lines of light radiating out over the landscape. The dome lines link the dome centers with each other in a subtle communications grid. The subtle landscape is characterized as an intricate pattern of spirals, straight lines, and pulsing circles of light, like a couple thousand blinking thimbles of multihued Light dotting the Earth in a geometric web of ribbony filaments flowing outwards in all directions. The Domes made the etheric structure of Earth what it is by imposing a consci ous matrix upon the planet to make Earth a place for possible human conscious evolution. According to Dome theory, when the Domes appeared on Earth they activated lines of light and energy already present in the etheric skeletal web of the planet. The Domes were Ships brought here as a response from what is called the Architect of Cosmic Destiny and in line with past proposals and future events for Earth. Technically, it's not accurate to say the Domes came and went because they exist spatially in between spirit and matter. However, they were present on Earth three times in planetary history. It is also not accurate to construe the Domes as mechanical material vehicles according to our customary understanding; they are more like transdimensional magnetic/energy facilitators overlaid on the physical landscape. In the first Dome Presence, there were no humans on Earth; in the second Dome Presence there was primitive human life; and during the third Dome Presence there were some humans who could clearly see the Domes and understand their function. What these early humans saw is recounted in various ancient mythologies (notably the Irish and Sumerian) as the Houses of the Sky Gods. When the Domes were present, which by our reckoning, was for a very long time, they imparted immediate energy/ consciousness imprints (1/4 to 1 mile in diameter) on the Earth's surface. These were permanent resonance patterns shaped like domes (or like lampshades set over hills and "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 147 mountains). This is an oscillating pattern which will persist until the Earth ceases to exist or until they are reaffirmed or altered by another Dome visit. Although clairvoyants today describe these etheric energy canopies resident over many hundreds of sacred mountains and past megalithic religious enclosures (e.g., Stonehenge, Machu Picchu, Palenque, Mt. Shasta, among many examples), these are actually etheric energy memories of the once quasi-materially present Domes. Though the Domes have \"left\", their powerful electromagnetic energy impressions remain in place, like the persistent retinal image of a light bulb held in front of our eyes in a dark room. The simultaneous presence and nonpresence of these Domes is a paradox of energy as created by the inadequacies of our language. Morphologically, however, the Domes were of varying sizes, capacities, and functions, arranged around the planet in a predetermined, numerically-fixed matrix according to star formations above. Their precise distribution patterning on Earth was a microcosmic reflection of esoteric macrocosmic star geometries. The \"Captain\" Domes, for example, distributed Love, Light, and Energy to the smaller Domes. The overriding intention of the Domes was to bring Earth to biological, sentient life. Even today, millions of years later, etheric traces of their silvery energy pipework (different from ley or dome lines)are still clairvoyantly visi ble on the landscape in such geomantically heightened places as Glastonbury, England. Visually, we can imagine nearly 2000 huge spherical, kinetic lampshades simultaneously descending like twinkling party hats over mountains, hills, and plateaus around the world, fitting down snugly and brightly, electrifying the Earth with their incredibly brilliant light and distributing this light through a spinning pin wheel matrix of Dome centers. The Domes were the originating homes of ley lines, or more accurately, within this conceptual model, the dome lines. These exist in two forms. Straight-running dome lines (averaging in length 5-30 miles) are lines of energy connecting one dome with another making an angular light matrix around the planet. An example of this pattern is found in California with Mt. Diablo (Contra Costa County) and Mt. Tamalpais (Marin County); both of these sacred mountains (as the native Indians originally perceived them), are just outside San Francisco, domed, about 25 miles apart, and are connected by a straight dome line. The dome lines, incidentally, are pulsating energy channels with marked variations in seasonal intensity. Each Dome had the capacity to initiate up to 48 affiliate"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"energy centers, or smaller domes, through a series of spiralling dome lines with a smaller dome cap at the end. These became affiliate, spiritualized power points in the landscape,but directly related, like child to parent, with the initiating Dome. Potentially there are 83,808 such dome caps on Earth, a figure that amply explains the near planetary ubiquity of ancient religious sites. The specific radiating pattern for the spiralling dome lines was heliocentric, according to the phi ratio (or Golden Mean, Golden Proportion, Golden Section of sacred geometry, expressed as 1.618034, which is an asymmetrical spiral exemplifie d in the patterning whorls of the sunflower and the leaf distri bution pattern fo r many plants and described as the Fibonacci Series). For example, Mt. Tamalpais sends out at least two dome caps into urban San Francisco, spiritually energizing t he areas of the Palace of Fine Arts and Lincoln Park. The Dome at Mt. Diablo similarly sends dome caps into what are no w urban Oakland and Berkeley. Moreover, whenever any spiral or straight dome lines intersect, they form minor power points called line nodes (Diagram 2). These are copi ous, far more so than the considerably abundant dome caps, and are characterized as variously solar/positive, lunar/negative, some centrifugal, some centripedal, in effect. Do mes, dome caps, and line nodes were sequentially marked by ancient geomancers with stone circles, major temples, barrows and stone chambers, and single standing stones, then afte rwards in the Christian ecclesiastical ascendancy, by churches. The entire geomantic panoply was once positioned care fully as a set of Grid engineering instruments of spir itual science within this precise web of Domes, dome caps, and line nodes, energy remains of which are today being detected, increasingly, by Earth Mysteries researchers (e.g ., the British Dragon Project, directed by Paul Devereaux, editor of The Ley Hunter ) . Remembered vaguely in myth, folklore, and local custom, these landscape temples, animated by Domes, linked by dome lines, may be forgotten, but t hey haven't been closed down. 6 Furthermore, according to Dome theory, on a planetary basis all the Domes are linked by way of interwoven gold and silver lines which emanate like cords from their crowns, and these are joined together at one spec ific planetary node which is the Grid's umbilicus and Master Do me. The gold and silver cords represent the balanced energy inputs of positive/negative, or male/female entering each Dome . In popular my thology, this umbilical point is called King Arthur's Round Table of Camelot. The Domes were brought to Ea rth to create a Paradise for "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"150 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID humankind. Each carried a light form, or seed crystal, of what was to be, both locally and globally, through the Grid. Of these Paradise crystals, some have been activated, but otherwise humankind has either not been aware of this divine potential or not bothered to make use of them to create the intended Earth Paradise. The option, however, still remains. Because of their heightened electromagnetic fields, the Dome enclosures were like immaculate, high consciousness meditation halls where human awareness could be healed, uplifted, even interdimensionally transported through the domed exit points in the Houses of the Gods, facilitated by megalithic engineering. The Irish Brugh na Boinne (the House by the River Boyne) known today as the Newgrange tumulus, was the home of the Tuatha de Danann, the Irish deities, and often visited by intrepid humans seeking an audience with their Gods. The domed coordination points in some cases contain psychic maps to the local esoteric geography. \"These maps are used to provide points of resonance, release, and deflection \" 7 and include details of the local layout of Domes, dome caps, line nodes, and dome lines and their energy/consciousness ratings. The Domes facilitate meditatively-acquired insight into the planetary thought matrix (what Teilhard de Chardin calls the \"noosphere\") which is present like a hologrammic library in the energy field of each Dome. This is why the Biblical Moses received the Pentateuch, or Torah Or, on Mt. Sinai, which was a pre-eminent sacred domed mountain. Furthermore, true to Hermes' Principle of Correspondence, and in a process of reciprocal inevitability, when the Domes arrived, their terrific heat brought up a dome of water from underground, with its multidirectional web of water veins, both to cool the searing Earth and to mirror the Light Dome above. Thus, even today, there are yang/centrifugal light lines and domes above ground, and yin/centripedal water lines and domes underground, etheric above, physical below. This is behind the phenomenon, constantly reported by dowsers of anomalous, copious water networks coincident with sacred enclosures. Thus the Domes, metaphysically speaking, distributed the vibrations of Love and Light from Above through this imposed Grid system,thereby spiritually irradiating the landscape and, by extension, human consciousness, with these positive', evolutionary energies. This is the key: Before Adam, the Elohim. The meaning of this gnomic statement will emerge as we move through the Grid. However, the doorway for this key is expressed in a single number, i.e., the number of planetary "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Diagram 3 The Human Chakra System Channels 1.

In the mystical science of Qabala and its mathematical language of gematria, this is a number of profound significance, for it is the fusion of the primary solar (666) and lunar (1080) the bipolar energies behind manifestation. In Qabala symbolism 1746 is the \"grain of mustard seed\" which the Christ likened to the Kingdom of Heaven; it is also, sy mbolically, the Divine Man, the Spirit of God on Earth, the Mysteries of Jesus, the Divinity of the Spirit, and others of similar import. The second key aspect of the Electromagnetic 1746 Grid is chakras. According to esoteric Hindu yoga, in the human etheric body there are 7 major subtle energy centers called chakras (Sanskrit for \"spinning wheels\") ranged linearly along the vertical spinal axis from the scrotum to the crown of the head. There are anywhere from 7 to 22 minor chakras as well, distributed throughout the body. The major chakras are like electrical junction boxes, or energy transducers, for the physical body, mediating higher plane energies through the material form. The chakras are functionally affiliated with the 7 principal endocrine glands and thereby with specific organ regions of the body and with specific ascending consciousness states as well. For example, the throat chakra, called Visuddha (meaning \"cleansed, clarified, perfectly pure.\") is related to the thyroid gland and the mastery of clairaudience (intangible hearing, as in the \"voices\" of the Gods; see Diagram 3). The 7 chakras are energetically interdependent and activated sequentially, beginning with the 2nd, proceeding to the 7th, then returning to the 1st, the Root, the seat of Kundalini, the fundamental creative cosmic evolutionary energy. Similarly in this model, the Earth, homologously, has a chakra system, arranged not in anatomical but energy sequence at 7 key Dome centers (Diagram 4). An Earth chakra, such as at the Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt, or at Glastonbury Tor, England, is a huge energy vortex , several miles in immediate diameter (and extending much further in area of influence), like a two-way swinging Grid door. It is a subtle electromagnetic interface between higher, nonphysical stellar energies and the material embodiment of them in the Earth or human body. An Earth chakra may be pictured like this: Picture tiny flowers all over the Earth. Some form larger flowers and some of these form even larger flowers. Chakras are energy in one form flowing into another, like flowers opening as parts of another flower, each independent yet interdependent, similar yet dissimilar. Alternately, we can visualise a mighty wheel with many spokes. At each spoke there is a point of light. The wheel "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Diagram 4 Planetary Chakras as Mapped on the Human "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"154 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID has a hub and each spoke has two ends. Each spoke is connected to the hub and to the wheel. The center of the hub is connected to neither the spokes nor the wheel; it is the still center. The wheel turns into the head of a white opened dandelion—this is the Earth. The spokes leave from every direction from the hub and the patterns of light emerge on the surface and extend beyond it. These points at the end of each spoke are the flowers, or nodes, or energy centers called chakras. Curiously, the geographical arrangement of the planetary chakra system is not immutable, although the changes occur very slowly and according to a predetermined plan, like a preset timer. The 2nd chakra, for example, now at Machu Picchu, Peru, was formerly at Delphi, Greece, site of the famous oracle; Mt. Kailas in Tibet was once Earth's 4th, or heart chakra, but this has since been \"moved\" to Glastonbury in England. The activation, operation, and cessation of planetary chakras, as well as dome centers, was originally calibrated for a definite time/evolutionary sequence based on a fundamental clairvoyant understanding of the vast reaches of planetary destiny. The 6th chakra, (the Brow, or Ajna, discussed below) changes focus every 200 years and is called the Mobile Focus; it operates like a consciousness beam moving purposefully over the planet according to a pre-arranged schedule of activations. Presently it is focussed on Glastonbury, but at one time in its long eventful history, it was resident in Jerusalem. Although the Domes have, tec hnically, paradoxically, left, they are still resident as powerful energy imprints, as the Mothers of all sacred Earth enclosures. The Electromagnetic 1746 Grid, furthermore, is still operational,though at a somewhat reduced Light intensity compared to what it would be like if the Domes were materially present again. Gaia's etheric energy body remains sentiently active, just as Her living physical form breathes through its biosphere. This level of the Grid can be likened to a radio carrying the whole range of frequency transmission capabilities. The various parts of the radio band are assigned to the Dome receptor matrix, which are like individual antenna or radio towers. This is a system of Grid sonics, of tone modulations. The various Dome centers are energised as sonic receptor sites according to a graduated dial of master transmissions'. In many cases stone devices, electromagnetically-adjusted, were positioned at the Dome antenna sites to facilitate sonic reception. Not only were the Dome sites, according to this theory, calibrated planetarily in terms of radio beam receptivity, they were also calibrated in terms of a master electromagnetic spectrum geared to the "},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 155 consciousness and life support needs of humans and biosphere. Each Dome was like a specially-set tuning fork; when struck by the incoming beam it then resonated this tone through its local web system as a uniform vibration. In recent years, many believe, the Grid has been undergoing a gradual, site-specific reactivation by the same agencies, the Elohim, that originally engineered and installed the system in accordance with Hermes' Principles. The Earth was made as a Home in Man's image. The Electromagnetic 1746 Grid anchors and differentiates the next dimensional Grid matrix called the Oroboric 15 Line Grid,which forms and maintains the biosphere and makes these higher energies available for human consciousness and technology interactions and for mutually-supportive human and Earth evolution. The Earth is enveloped in a lace doily of electromagnetic fields and pulsing points of light which move the incoming intelligent cosmic/stellar energy streams through the matrix, always tending towards balance. The role of the geomancer, intelligently manipulating and cooperating with the Electromagnetic 1746 Grid, has been to harmonise these incoming streams against the chaotic entropic energy fields created by negative thought forms of resident humans, and to maintain the health of both human and Gaia. The geomancer has always been the Earth doctor and human metaphysician. The Oroboric 15 Line Grid The ancient Chinese geomancers had a comprehensive understanding of the manifold harmonious relations between Heaven, Earth, and the Human. They stated there was first the Wu Chi, the one primal vibration or Cosmic Sound (called OM in Sanskrit, the Logos in original Christianity) that differentiates into the Tai Ch'i, or Two Tones (yin/yang polarity), which then manifests as the 12 Tones, the Lu. The 12 Lu are the 12 fundamental pitches within the octave, related to each other by specific ratios. In the West this twelvefold differentiation of the octave is known as the Zodiac; this is another topology of the basic cosmic modulations of celestial harmonics. Moreover, the Chinese stated that the vibratory modulations influence Earth in a regular oscillation according to hourly, semi-daily, daily, weekly, biweekly, mont hly, seasonal, yearly, and meta-annual cycles, all catalogued in astronomical/astrological tables. The geomantic year was apportioned into 12 Notes, 6 yin, 6 yang, each assigned to one of the 5 Elements (wood, fire, metal, water, soil). "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"156 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID Meanwhile the acupuncturists had charted the 12 primary energy meridians in the human body, assigning to each a yin/yang polarity (e.g., Absolute Yin, Lesser Yang), an organ (e.g., spleen, heart, liver, lungs ), an element (e.g., Heart/fire, Liver/Wood, Kidneys/water), and a yearly-daily time of heightened activity, p r o p i t i o u s for treatment (e.g., Heart/Summer/Noon-2 p.m.). And they tied the system conceptually together with a set of 4 Laws of Ch'i, which basically operate in alignment with Hermes' Principle of Rhythm, including Mother-Son, Husband-Wife, Noon-Midnight, and the 5 Elements. These govern and describe the oscillating energy movements in both the human and Earth meridians (Diagram 5). In the West the twelvefold permutations of the One energy were catalogued in terms of our familiar Zodiacal attributions (e.g., Sagittarius/fire, Taurus/earth, Gemini/air), each \"ruled\" by a planet (e.g., Venus rules Taurus, Mercury rules Gemini), and associated with particular body regions (e.g., Taurus with the throat, Gemini with the ears, arms, hands, chest, lungs, and Sagittarius with hips and thighs). In mythology this circuit of 12 has found expression in the image of King Arthur's Round Table of Grail Knights, each Kn ight representing one station of this spinning Zodiac House. The Chinese acupuncturists further discovered that in addition to the 10 organ-related meridians and their two affiliate ch annels (Heart Governor/yin and Three Heater/yang),there were two additional regulatory channels, namely, the Governing Vessel (yang/solar/front of the body/directing) and the Conception Vessel (yin/lunar/back of the body/responding). Meanwhile the Indian yogis had described the three (related) subtle nadis, or channels of Kundalini through the chakras. These are the pingala nadi (solar/right side), ida nadi (lunar/left side), and sushumna nadi (neutral/central fusion pathway; see Diagram 3). The pingala carries the Fire of Matter; the ida channels the Fire of Manas; and through the sushumna courses the Fire of Spirit-—from the Root to the Crown chakra, according to the evolutionary sequence of chakra awakenings. For the purposes of this model, we will consider the pingala nadi and Governing Vessel meridian to be homologous and the ida pingala and Conception Vessel to be similarly related.

The Oroboric Grid, with its balanced Tai Ch'i of, alternatingly, 6 yin and 6 yang lines, is the foundation for the magnetic polarities of the Electromagnetic 1746 Grid and thereby for physical Earth. Magnetic energy, with its north/south poles operating in a charged biofield about matter, is concerned with establishing pol arity or the balancing of the energy flow between two defined points. \"W ithout magnetics there would be nothing to hold the universe together for it...contains the flow of vibrations back and forth within the theoretical lim its of this universe.\" 8 Thus the Oroboric Grid is comp rised of 15 Earth-traversing Dragon Lines, broad avenues of so lar-differentiated Light,that, like the mythic Oroboros serpent, link their tails with their mouths, making a complete energ y circuit, or Great Circle, about the planet. These are not ra diations from the Domes or dome caps, like dome lines, thoug h they do intersect and interact with Domes and dome ca ps (See Diagram 2). Nor do these Oroboros Lines oscillate but they are, rather, consistent lines of energy surrounding the planet and containing the organic film of Earth life. They run somewhat above the Earth's surface, often parallel with t he straight-running dome lines. Twelve major Oroboros Lines encircle the globe making 12 Great Circles; each has a diff erent solar energy, ordinarily denominated by the 12 Zodiacal attributes (e.g., a Taurus Oroboros Line). Th ere are three minor lines, ordinarily denominated by the qu alities of male, female, and neutral. Basically the 12 Orobo ros Lines correlate wi th the 12 Chinese Lu and 12 organ meridians, while t he 3 minor Oroboros Lines correspond with the 3 nadis (and Governing/Conception Vessels). The Great Circles each have diff erent and varying levels of vibration, or color, but they do not involve all the colors of the spectrum. Gold is a principal color while lilac is found on occasion. The Oroboros Lines are primary energy tracks. After the birth of a biological being, such as Gaia, the primary energy lines determine the nature of its growth and environment, i.e., the biosphere. We can visualise a sphere with 15 golden, white, and lilac lines encircling it at geometric intervals, making a total of 62 points of inters ection and 120 equal-sized triangles. Within each of these intersections is a positive and negative line running across t he surface. These two are represented by pale blue lines which form the recessed side of "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 159 the 120 triangles. The forward lines of these triangles are golden or white, and the positive/negative lines are not fixed but oscillate in a rhythmic patter n. This overall Oroboric figure incorporates the dodecahedron and icosahedron, two of the Platonic Solids (described below) forming the biosphere; in fact, the form for Earth is a combination of all 5 Platonic Solids (abstract forms of the 5 elements, which form the next dimensional Grid). This is the energy lattice covering the Earth; it is what produced Earth's environmental structure. A well-known example of an Oroboros Line is the St. Michael Dragon Ley in England. Dowsers trace its course for 380 miles, extending from southwest Cornwall at Michael's Mount (at 62 degrees East of North, aligned with the May 1, or Beltane, sunrise,one of the Celtic quarterly calendar days) to northeast Suffolk at Bury St. Edmunds. Along the way it is dotted with numerous eponymous Christian Church and earlier megalithic dedications. The St. Michael Oroboros Line, however, is much longer than 380 miles; nor is it the exclusive property of Michaelic Britain. It extends entirely around the planet, joining itself again after a circumferential journey of some 24,000 miles. Its width varies at different points, being at some areas as narrow as 4 feet, while at others measuring several hundred yards in width. There are actually many Grid lines above the Earth, with the final one being two miles above the ground. Oroboros meridians particularly vary in width and intensity at nodal points (Domes, dome caps, line nodes, and Oroboric intersections) and may have thousands of major and minor treatment points arrayed along their length. There is a specific site on Earth where the Michael/solar and Oroboros/Lunar Lines actually touch down, beginning and ending their planetary circuit and consequently activating the other 12 Zodiacal Ororobos Lines. This is also the site of the Master Dome, the original Round Table of Camelot, the Zodiacal Court of the Sun. This place is Avebury Circle, in central Wiltshire, England. Avebury,- according to this model, is the planetary umbi li cus. Avebury is Earth's primary cosmic/electrical socket. It's where the Earth plugs into the cosmos. Avebury is Grid Central, the planetary geomantic switchboard (See Diagram 6). Each of the Earth's 1746 Domes has two vertical light cords—-one gold, one silver—rising out of its top like an insulated lampshade cord. All these dual-weaved cords are joined together into one master interwoven cable at the Avebury Master Dome. Moreover, Avebury is, to borrow another term from esoteric"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Diagram 6 Avebury Circle as Planetary Grid Umbilicus (From: The Avebury Monuments, Faith de M.

The sutratma is the channel through which the direct stream of life from the Spirit flows through the lower spiritual bodies and Soul to the personality and physical body; it is anchored in the etheric heart chakra. The life stream controls the circulation of the human blood and the planetary ch'i. For the Earth Avebury is the inner etheric heart, called Ananda-kanda, and operates in tandem with Glastonbury, the outer etheric heart, called Anahata (See Diagram 4). The sutratma at Avebury as the planetary tie-down for the basic solar/pingala and lunar/ida Oroboros Lines is also what is known in Ecclesiastes as \"the Silver Cord, the thread that binds all the selves in the human being with the divine.\" Thus the primary Tai Ch'i, or energy/consciousness polarity, enters the Earth Grid through her inner heart chakra at Avebury where it is then distributed throughout the Oroboric Grid as Gaia's emotional life blood. Each Grid line, vertical and horizontal, connects with the whole pattern covering the globe. Each of the two lines entering Avebury is connected at other points with each of the other 13 Oroboros Lines. The solar Oroboros comes in as a burst of pure Spirit, fiery, almost deadly, carrying absolute, eternal consciousness; it is assigned the gematria 666 by Qabala. The lunar Oroboros is cool, moist, refreshing, like a revivifying draught, carrying incarnate consciousness, subject to temporal cycles of birth and death, time and space; it is assigned the gematria 1080. The two energies are fused at Avebury (just as they are within the dual human heart chakra), their currents sent coursing through the Grid. The number of their fusion is 1746, which is the sum of 1080 and 666. The dynamics of their interactive fusion, as a ratio of 666/1080 is the phi spiral of unfolding Light, namely, 1.618034. This is a fact fundamental to the nature of Light (described below) and at the heart of the Grid and the Human. While the solar and lunar lines are tied down at the planetary inner heart at Avebury, the Neutral Oroboros Line (equivalent to the sushumna nadi,carrying the Fire of Spirit) is anchored at Earth's crown chakra, Mt. Cook in western New Zealand,through which t h e dual Avebury-originating lines pass in their Great Circles. What is at play here is that the primary yin/yang polarity of the Oroboros 15 Line Grid produces the balanced phi-described fusion of the 1746 Electromagnetic Grid, which is to say, Light finding balanced manifestation in the Earth Body. As Doris Lessing writes, \"The outer web of musical light created the inner earthy one and held it there in its dance of tension.\" It is "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"162 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID \"a connecting feeding mesh (like an electric grid of humanity)\". The Oroboric 15 Line Grid is Gaia's emotional body, her personality, expressed twelvefold as the Zodiacal archetypes of the 12 Lu— and thus ours, too, as human residents upon Gaia. This dimension of the Grid is our home on Earth such that, as Lessing says, \"In the great singing dance, everything linked and moved together. My mind was the facet of a mind, like cells in a honeycomb.\" Each of the Oroboros Lines was originally at some point anchored down to Earth by agency of special physical Vibrating Stones which came with the Domes. They were apparently material stones, as we know stones, about the size of a spherical suitcase. They were brought here by Plan of the Cosmic Chaplains and Elohim geomancers appearing here in the Domes; the stones were activated by the Domes, then positioned at key sites around the Earth to form what is called a Global Hermetic Megalithic Calendar, for the benefit of all living forms. Each Vibrating Stone had its time of significance, in accordance with all the synchronously overlapping Zodiac schedules of activity, from the 12-hour cycle to the Great Year of 25,920 years. All 12 stones resonated in harmony and in resonance with each other. One such Vibrating Stone was placed, according to several geomancers, at Beckery Island, a small hill just outside the center of Glastonbury, Somerset, and tied down the Taurus Oroboros Line as it was intersected by the Michael/Solar Oroboros passing through the town. This particular site was also known in ancient Welsh myth as one of Britain's Three Perpetual Choirs (the Choir of Afallach, or Avalon). These were continual geomantic resonators, established on the landscape as reflections of a heavenly model related to three different aspects of consciousness translated to Earth. Activated long ago from a divine source, the Choirs were originally far more active than at present,and were related to healing. The Vibrating Stone from Beckery was subsequently removed but remains conspicuously visible though totally anomalously, elsewhere in Glastonbury. Thus in geomantic terms, the Taurus Stone was the primary receptor for the Taurean tone/vibration for the Oroboros Grid. It was the main reservoir, amplifier, disperser, and transducer/transmuter of t h i s 1/12th differentiation of cosmic energy entering our biosphere. The 12 stones acting in concert formed the foundation of the Global Hermetic Calendar. The central coordination point for this Global Stone Calendar of Zodiac energies is Avebury, the condensed planetary "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 163 Round Table of the Sun. The Round Table is a model for understanding the interdependent ac tivities of the 12 Tones of the one Sound. The planetary Round Table is in effect the central receptor complex for the composite energies and consciousness of our solar system, for our particular Star Evolution paradigm of Light/Life /Consciousness whose King is our Sun. Our solar system, i deally, is comprised of 12 revolving, rotating, inter-relating bodies (This figure includes the Sun and its reflector, the Moon, and the energy shell of the supposedly destroyed planet called Maldek or Marduk, now present as an asteroid belt between Mars and J upiter). This was the original ideal solar octave of 12 planetary no tes. Just as our Gaia is a living sentient being, so is our solar system a larger unified consciousness entity whose point of awareness is called by esotericists the Solar Logos. Each planet is directly related, in terms of \"ruling\" influence, to one of the 12 Zodiac Houses thereby producing a triangular pa ttern of influence of stars, planets, and Earth coordinates, m ediated to this planet through the Oroboros Grid and Avebu ry Round Table of the Sun. The planetary Round Table is t he means by which Gaia can experience the differentiated ener gies of the Solar Logos, of which She is an integral part. The Oroboros Grid represents the 12 Knights of Gaia's Round Table, the means by which these 12 oscillating influences are di stributed to Her body and eventually to the consciousness of Her human, Zodiacally-attuned residents. Gaia's Grid body is the personality of the Sun express ed twelvefold. As Above, So Below, said Hermes. We have, then, t he Oroboros Grid interfacing the energy dynamics of the solar system and its organising consciousness, t he Solar Logos, for embodied humanity. By meditative mast ery of the Round Table we penetrate to the esse nce of our Star Evolution paradigm, of which we are biophysical miniat ures, chemical holograms, and thus we stand on the threshold of transcendence, of attaining in consciousness that fourth dimensional quality called anti-gravity. There are, of cour se, inherent limitations to our Grid conceptualizations th rough Zodiacal archet ypes. Much of this descriptive symbolism is manm ade and homocentric, and thus not necessarily truly accurate wit h respect to the realities of the Grid as the Elohim would de scribe them. From their vantage point, things are more cyclical and interdependent. It is not so much constellations and stones, but matter vibrating in synchronicity. Things are synchronousl y resonating in "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"164 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID reciprocal maintenance with each other and thus feed the Earth. The Earth reciprocally mainta ins this relationship of interdependence. Each of the 12 Stones resonates at a pa rticular frequency that is in sympathetic harm ony with certain astrological constellations. The most rele vant point, however, is the relationship. The Earth is an active force as well as a receptive matrix. Each celestia l, terrestrial and lunar body is in sympathetic resonan ce, one with the ot her, travelling at tremendous speeds through infini te space. As we chart the Oroboros Grid, and particularly th e Polyhedronic Crystal Grid (described next) we steadily approach the barrier between third and fourth dimensions, with all the inherent inadequacies and d i f f i c u l t i e s of Earth-based language and l i n e a r conceptualization. Thus the Earth Grid at this level, through the Avebury umbilicus, is the Round Table as a planetary hologram of the energy/consciousness body of the Solar Logos. It is the receiving/transmitting device expressed at the borderline between third and fourth dimens ions. In the context of the Earth we have expressed the energy realities of the Sun's Royal Court, which itself is but a component of the far larger vibrational body of the Galactic Logos. Now, the Grid contains a practical, localised feature th at makes the conscious human experience with the Sun's Zodiacal Court possible. The landscape Zodiac (discussed below) is the local, accessible hologram of the Mast er Round Table of Avebury and the Solar Logos,and represents an experiential workshop for aligning human with planetary, solar, galactic, and universal energy streams. We could liken the function of the landscape Zodiac (i.e., in which the energy skeletons of constellations around the ecliptic are overlaid on a 30 mile circumferential band on the Earth, as in So merset, England, with the Glastonbury Zodiac) to that of a geomantic concert hall wherein we hear the Music of the Sp heres as played by the local affiliate orchestra. There is some classical precedent for this musical interpretation of the Grid. Py thagoras and Plato both presented Grid models couched in musical terms. Pythagoras described a Cosmic Ship of Music comprised of our planets and neighboring stars, which sailed throug h the Heavens emitting rhoizamata, or \"rushing sounds\", which we could hear when we tuned the seven-stringed lyre of ourselves (the unif ied chakra system) to resonate with the celestial musi c (accomplished or played by the Grid). Plato spoke of the Spindle of Ne cessity which he "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 165 envisioned as the solar system rotating about the axis of the universe. On each whorl of this Spindle sits a Siren who sings a single note. In either case the total resonance pattern, the total Sound, the complete concert, is the celestial music of our King Sun, what Doris Lessing calls \"the controlling governor of them all... the majestic core of our web... the deep low organ note that underlies all being... God's singing center.\" The Polyhedronic Crystal Grid The Grid now operates in the fourth dimension as a function of crystal geometry, comprising the 5 Platonic Solids. This is Gaia's mental body, the sphere of abstract thinking and concrete knowledge, what Plato recognised as the world of Forms. Here the 15 Oroboros Grid Lines, which in the preceding Grid dimension beribbon the Earth sphere in a kinetic band of light, here are fused together into one unified polyhedron of 120 equal-sized triangles (or 10 hexagons, or 30 diamonds) with 62 intersection points. Grid mappers Bethe Hagens and William Becker call this geometri cal Grid dimension the \"Earth Star.\" Whereas in the Oroboric Grid the 15 Great Circles collectively form and maintain the living biosphere, here in the Polyhedronic Crystal Grid the 5 elements (which are differentiated out in the Oroboros Lines, e.g., Taurus/earth, Gemini/air, Sagittarius/fire), exist in their abstract, more static, crystalline form, as Platonic Solids (e.g., fire/tetrahedron, earth/cube, air/octahedron, water/icosahedron, ether/dodecahedron). The Earth Crystal is the formative agent for the kinetic Oroboros Lines, which represent, in a sense, the elements in motion, manifesting the biosphere. We can visualise the Polyhedron as a multifaceted etheric crystal superimposed over the Earth, like an overcoat, or like a geometric padded hatbox for a most delicate and flowery headpiece. Here the 5 Platonic Solids (as the abstract form of the elements) form a unified etheric crystal, with all the predictable geometrical/consciousness/formative properties of the crystal---such as the containment and patterning of Light. We can better appreciate how the Earth Polyhedron functions by reviewing the properti es of crystals. Crystals are rightly called \"windows of Light,\" as patterning and dimensional-transmitting doorways from the kinetic world of Light radiation down through the more apparently static material world of form—and the reverse. Crystals can amplify "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"166 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID and project thought forms; facilitate interdimensional communication; operate as tuning forks at specific frequencies to key individuals and their environments to desired light harmonics; receive and transmit high energy inputs; maintain unified electromagnetic fields to provide balance and harmony; serve as cosmic batteries, storing and releasing energy on schedule; function as archetypal libraries, holding messages, codes, histories, schedules; work as light modulators; or act as psychic binoculars and telescopes seeing over great time/space distances. These are documented applications of material plane crystals but their enumeration helps us understand the geometry of consciousness and Light at play in this more abstract Grid dimension. Physical life on Earth is an oscillating dance of the 5 elements, as orchestrated to us through successively more material Grid interfaces, and as played for us by the symphonic interactions of the 11 planets (minus Earth), the 12 Zodiac Houses, and other influential star families (e.g., Sirius, Orion, Arcturus, among others ). The Earth in its higher mental body manifestation is a crystal receptor floating in space, moving through the harmonic web of the stellar Grid, itself a vast unified crystal-polyhedron. We move with the Earth as a facet in the life and being of our King Sun, our Solar Logos,whose body is our solar system, source of our Light, Life, and Consciousness parameters. We live, through these interpenetrating Grid dimensions, the stellar evolutionary life of our Sun in concert with his (once) 11 satellite planets, his Knights (now minus Maldek) and ecliptically-neighboring Zodiac. We are all on the same solar wave-length as mediated through the Polyhedronic Crystal Grid. \"Every star evolution is on a valency of Light which determines its own evolutionary program,\" writes J. J. Hurtak. 10 This represents our Solar Fishnet, the specific conditions of Light, Life, and Consciousness that constitute our home in the solar system. The fundamental Round Table of the Sun, of which planet Earth is a valiant Knight, is marked by the projected ecliptic our Earth makes through the 12 Houses of the Zodiac (or the apparent path the Sun takes) during a 12 month cycle; it is also described by the Sun's own ecliptic peregrination in 2160 year spurts (following the Precession of the Equinoxes) through these same constellations. Just as the Earth is visualised as this rotating, revolving crystalline receptor, wired for sound to the other planets and stars, dancing to the fivefold tune within the context of the evolutionary po ssibilities of this single Sun "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 167 system and on the specific dance floor of planet Ea rth, so, too, is the local solar sys tem a unified, evolving Being functioning within its own Light/Life/Consci ousness paradi gm within a larger controlling body. The Sun and the totality of the solar system, when seen from a distance, free of time an d space limitations, is a Light Crystal with interpenetrating Gr ids, surrounding each planet and linking them in a solar web. This is really a question of fundamental limitations. \"Man is chained to his geomagnetic cycles,\" says Hurtak, living in \"planetary bondage to its own Light field\" or \"solar magnetic field paradigm\", operating under \"the ancient astrophysical status of Light upon Earth.\" Humans exist on Earth, adds Doris Less ing, within their \"terrible bondage, the chains of necessity that grasped them... This web was an iron, a frightful necessit y, imposing its design.\" Our electromagnetic spectrum, disp ensed by the Sun and mediated through the Polyhedronic Crystal Grid, is both our familiar home and our frightful jail, depending on our orientation. Gravity holds us rooted to t he material Earth and the solar winds blow hard to keep us str apped to the Eart h's surface and within Her electromagnetic field. However, at the doorway of the Polyhedron, the place wher e our evolutionary Light paradigm for Humanity on Earth is molded and transmitted, we have the possibility of lifting of f in a rush of anti-gravity. The Earth Grid repres ents the geometry of consciousness, the constraints on awareness and fourth dimensional transcendence, our biochemical /evolutionary parameters of expression. The crystalline Star Grid, of which our Earth is a component, is the form-dynamics of our local St ar Evolution program, namely, the restrictions on consciousness, or that which upholds what Hurtak calls \"the bioconsciousness of the old planetary cycles\", or that which maintains \"the electromagnetic ordering of the life code.\" Our interpenetrating Grid system is like a huge solar DNA hologram enveloping, infiltrating, and living us inescapably. It is a particular electromagnetic domain, or frequen cy/life spectrum, which is a partial expression (tailored for Ea rth, just as Venus and Mars have their own Grid realities) of the unified Star Evolution Grid, itself but a cosmic DNA hologram of a larger harmonic being. So here we live, as humans on Earth, breathing within and as sentient facets of this resonating matrix. It fits like a primary tuning fork over our noosphere and biosphere such that not one atom or electron or speeding quark escapes its dominant resonance. Yet this same Cryst al Grid represents the possible Grid"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"168 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID Doors out of this Sun-imposed paradigm. It holds the key to anti-gravity; here the stellar Grid restrictions can be transcended, here human consciousness can depart the solar system, soaring off the Earth in a burst of Light into the fourth and fifth dimensions. This is freedom from gravity, which is none other than the weight of the mind/body/emotions bounded by the linear time/space fishnet of the Grid. Anti-gravity, as we will see below, is fundamentally a consciousness technology, a transcending mastery of the Grid. Our stellar Grid, after all, is only one of billions of such star evolution crystal grids glittering in what Hurtak calls \"the Sea of Crystal\", which is our Milky Way seen through mystic eyes. Star systems now are seen as individual, interdependent, inter-resonating geometric harmonic Grids of Light. Thus the Polyhedronic Grid is like a central distribution warehouse for a supermarket chain. Here all the groceries and produce are received and parcelled out, first for the regional distributors, then the individual units. The Platonic Solids, in this model, receive the abstract energy impulses, or bulk shipments, from the Zodiac Houses, other stars and planets, then parcel them out down through the succeeding 3 Grids to the physical Earth and our daily lives as Grid consumers—all in accordance with the inherent geometric/elemental design. Here is an example of how this system works. Recently at the moment of the lunar eclipse and full Moon of Libra 1986, the Earth tetrahedron received a major solar activation. The 5 Platonic Solids form what is in truth an indivisible whole; but for the purpose of this illustration, let us envision the tetrahedron alone, as a 3-sided pyramid within a basketball, but with the corners protruding like big toes from old socks. From the apex of the pyramid/tetrahedron, rises a spiralling cone extending far into space, into the starfields. At the moment of activation, first the cone, then the pyramid, blushed an effulgent gold throughout. Momentarily the tetrahedron was radiant and vibrationally jubilant with powerful solar energy amidst the other Solids which formed a clear quartz crystal. Obviously, shortly afterwards the fire-energized pyramid began diffusing its new energies throughout the unified polyhedron. The planetary positioning point (apex up) for this now golden tetrahedron within the Polyhedronic Crystal Grid overlap on Earth is Richland-Balsam Mt. (or The Balsam; or Mt. Balsam Cone; current elevation 6500 feet, ancient elevation 6666 feet) in Western North Carolina, 20 miles south of Waynesville, just off the Blue Ridge Parkway (heading \"north\"). The Earth Crystal, then, is \"wired for sound\" with the other"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 169 interior crystal organs of the Sun system by way of the Stellar Grid. The Stellar Grid is structured differently than the various Earth Grids. When we visualize a geodesic or other multi-faceted rhomboid solid, we see subtle lines of energy passing from one plane of experience or existence to a similar plane or facet in a rhomboid at another dimension. This is the Stellar/Earth Grid connection. It is linked with forces of an etheric nature. The Stellar Grid may be visualized from Earth as a lace curtain or pattern of interconnected snowflakes stretching across the entire night sky. The Soul of Gaia In the theory of Earth's higher bodies, this is Gaia's causal body, the inner Temple of Solomon, the Soul of our sentient planet. This is the prime consciousness Grid for Gaia, centered in a quasi-physical, quasi-etheric domain roughly coordinated topographically with the Kun Lun Mountains and Gobi/Lob Nor Deserts of Mongolia/Northern China. Like the brow chakra of the human, which is the seat of clairvoyance, the Soul of Gaia is an interdimensional realm, essentially hidden and mostly intangible. It can be physically entered, however, occasionally by human adepts or somewhat more easily in the visionary body, through various meditative/geomantic doorways around the Earth. At this level we encounter the Planetary Logos called Sanat Kumara (The One Initiator) who presides over Earth's inner life as the Soul, mediating through the brow chakra the \"Word of God\" to the physical Being of Gaia (See Diagram 4). Through the activated brow chakra, one comes to know one's true divine identity and life purpose. This is echoed Biblically in St. John's Revelation where he describes the 144,000 Children of Israel on Mt. Zion, standing with the Lamb (Christ), each with the Name of God written on their foreheads (in their brow chakra). In our time, planetarily, the Soul of Gaia operates by means of the Mobile Focus. This consciousness beam contains the inner Soul awareness and evolutionary program for Gaia and all her residents and is usually mediated to the physical plane through the four succeeding Grids. However, in our special historical moment, the Mobile Focus is coming through the planet's outer heart chakra at Glastonbury. The Mobile Focus is continually moving, travelling over the Earth's surface with no permanently fixed location. Theoretically it is fully resident in one locality for about 100 years but with an overspill of energy before and afterwards of 50 years each,making 200 years total presence in one locale. "},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"170 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID The Mobile Focus, it is believed, was once resident at Jerusalem and Mt. Kailas, but in the course of Earth history, obviously it has been many places. The Focus operates by means of a predetermined evolutionary activation mechanism. If we wind up a clock, it then proceeds through its mechanism to tell time. As the Domes supposedly came three times, they preprogrammed the matrix of energy lines over Earth to coincide with certain planetary and constellationary exactitudes existing in the far future. The action of the Mobile Focus is much like the effect a living Master, like the 14th Dalai Lama, for example, can have on a receptive human. We can experience a profound change in our consciousness just by sitting in the presence of such a Master, but only to the degree of our receptivity to his/her heightened pure vibrations. The Mobile Focus, as a geomantic Living Master for Gaia, has been moved, therefore, in accordance with a Master Plan, a vast far-seeing tablet of planetary destiny, over Earth's surface, to resonate equally at each culture, for each creed, for 200 year periods—facilitating the implementation of Gaia's Soul programs into the physical domain of human culture. The Mobile Focus, in this model, is an initiatory energy beam designed by Adepts under guidance of the Elohim, for the transfiguration of consciousness from the human plane to one of angelic resonance. It is like a powerful spotlight of color/sound/vibration/energy shone steadily over a specific region (e.g., a Dome center). It has as its agenda the uplifting of human awareness into knowledge of the Master Plan and that particular bioregion's role in achieving this total Plan for Earth. Here we listen to Gaia's Soul telling Her (and us) the reason and purpose for our existence as an inhabited planet. Here we listen to the wise voice of Her Planetary Logos, Sanat Kumara, as He imparts spiritual qualities through the Grid matrix. Thus we begin to understand why things are precisely the way they are on the physica l plane, according to Hermes' Principle of Causation. We begin to appreciate that Gaia's karma is largely the result of our ill-informed actions over the milennia. Indeed, when Gaia is appreciated as a sentient, coherent, living Being, then we will awake in horror at the scope of the injuries we've inflicted upon Her. From the interpretive vantage of the mystical science of Qabala, Earth's 5 interpenetrating Grid Bodies may be seen as part of a basic abstract model for reality called the Tree of Life (Diagram 7). The Tree is composed of 12 spheres (called Sephira [plural; Sephiroth, singular] : 10 manifest, 2 subtle)"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Diagram 7 Qabala Tree of Life "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"172 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID and 22 pathways linking these energy/consciousness domains. Earth, at the bottom sphere (Malkuth, 10th Sephiroth) is linked, through the pathways (The group name is Autiot, forming the 22 sacred letters, the later basis for the Hebrew language) to God, at Kether, at the top of the Tree. Ideally the Tree resonates as one vibrational being with the Name of God, the unpronounceable, ineffable Tetragrammaton. The planets and Zodiac Houses are positioned on the Tree which as a totality operates synchronously in many levels of manifestation and understanding (e.g., human consciousness, the Earth Grid, the Solar Logos). One Grid system is always an interdependent tone in a broader Grid harmonic. The Tree model presents the Grid as a linear sequencing of higher influences mediating downwards to Earth; but in truth, it's more like an onion made of dozens of onion skins. The reality is the immediacy and integrity of the onion, or Grid-—with all levels synchronously resonating, one within the other (Diagram 8). The synchronous Grid resonance is finally brought down to the physical Earth—the ultimate Grid theater for this complex drama of cosmic energies within the context of ordinary daily human consciousness on Earth. The Terrestrial Megalithic Grid \"The whole world was laid out according to a cosmic scheme,\" explains British doyen of Earth Mysteries, John Michell. 11 The megalithic culture accomplished its spiritual engineering by means of the landscape stone temple. Positioned geomantically at Dome centers, su ch landscape temples (e.g., in Britain, Stonehenge, Maiden Castle, Arbor Low, Rollright Circle, Maes Howe, and many others) functioned as \"a receiving station for direct influences from heavenly constellations and earth energies\" thereby uniting Heaven and Earth. Prehistoric Britain was an epicenter of such megalithic consciousness engineering, and was a land of \"closely-linked, intercommunicating centers,\" adds Michell, \"engaged in the same scientific program.\" Characterizing in part modern Britain, Michell noted, \"A great scientific instrument lies sprawled over the entire surface of the globe. The vast scale of prehistoric engineering is not yet generally recognized.\" While the sophistication of \"prehistoric\" megalithic engineering may remain as yet largely unrecognized, certainly its still copious and visible remains do not go unacknowledged. The extent and abundance of extant megalithic sites in Britain alone is staggering. Estimates state there are still 1000 stone "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Diagram 8 The Grid as a Function of Interpenetrating Higher Dimensional Bodies for the Living Earth "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"174 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID chambers, at least 30,000 barro ws, 900 stone circles, 3000 hillforts, and coun tless thousands of singl e standing stones, all in varying states of decay and neglect. The names are multiple and various,too, for the scient ific panoply of megalithic engineering: cromlech, dol men, menhir, quoit, hill figure, fogou, souterrain, cairn, stone row, round towe r, pyramid, brugh, gallery grave, causewayed camp, ring-and-ditch. These are best appreciated as some of the many precise geomantic tools for consciousness-technology on ce employed by the master geomancers of Gaia. The context for these megalithi c engineering applications was the interface between the Earth's indigenous electromagnetic fiel d and the Electromagnetic 1746 Grid, which acted to re-arrange and harness the magnetized Earth field. The Earth is surrounded by a unified magnetic field and within this it behaves as if it were a ball of magnetized iron, with north and south po les (Diagram 9). This is a fluctuating field, with daily shifts in to tal geomagnetic forc e (from 0.0002 gauss at the Equator to 0.0005 gauss at the Poles, and a geomagnetic daily intensity vari ation of 20-50 gammas). Most scientists attribute these changes to the Sun; solar flares and magnetic storms thereby initia ting geomagnetically traumatic situations on Earth. Moreover, geomagnetic field polarity, seen over time, switches often, and has done so perhaps many hundreds of times in the Earth' s long history (estimated at every 230,000 years), causing tremendous biospheric and geologic alterations and life form extinctions. The Earth's huge,oscillating electromagnetic field is the Mother to our own hum an biofields, themselv es the Mother to our individual organ biofields. It acts as a primal energy womb in which all living forms on Earth have taken their nourishment and continuing energet ic sustenance. In a system of magnetic ecology the human energy rh ythms take their cue from variations in the Earth's magnetic field; thus human biorhythms are conditioned by geomagnetic fluc tuations which act for us as timers, modulators, regulators , and, if used properly, as healers. The ancient Druids of Britain, as did the old feng shui masters of China, comprehend ed these manifold energy bonds and knew how to work harmoniously, creatively, with the interdependent, multidirectional flow of electromagnetic pulses to maintain individual health, communal cooperation, and world peace. Their context was the Terrestrial Megalithic Grid and their means was consciousness technology. The geomantic secret of t he Druids was that they comprehended the Grid as a supermagnetic armature.

The basic design principles of the electric moto r illustrate this reality. The electric motor has three basic pa rts, relevant to this Grid model: the armature, stationar y bar magnet, and commutator. The armature is that part of an electric generator, dynamo, or motor in which elec trical energy is produced. Usually it is a core of soft iron wound with insu lated wires which produces an electromagnetic field in respon se to an incoming electric current. The armature is the main, revolving, current-carrying winding, acting as an induc ed electromagne t. The coiled armature reacts with the stat ionary bar magnet, actually creating its magnetic field. When the armature ro tates between the newly established poles of the bar magnet, this generates the electromotive force, or po wer—the whole purpose of the motor. The commutato r directs (and changes) the flow of the primary electrical current from the generator, either in a direct-current or altern ating-current manner. The electromotive force, which deriv es from the rotation of the armature through a magnetic field, provides the energy source. Thus electricity in motion pr oduces a magnetic field which in motion across an electrical field in a magnet yields electromotive force. If the direct ion of the electric current is changed through the commu tator, the poles reverse direction when the armature acco rdingly changes its rotational direction. A direct-current of constant strength produces an unchanging magnetic field whereas an alte rnating -current makes the magnetic field reverse itself every time the current reverses. Thus the Grid is a supermagnetic armature. The Oroboric 15 Line Grid is the coiled armature. The sutratma of interwoven gold/silver Oroboros Lines enter ing Avebury Circle represents the commutator, the channel for the variously positive/negative electrical current that produces the electromagnet in the Oroboros a rmature. The Oroboros armature produces the electromagnetic fi eld in the stationary bar magnet of the Earth, in reaction with its indigenous mineral, crystal, and stone conductors. \"The Earth's core, composed mostly of molten iron, conduc ts electric currents which amplify accompanying magnetic fields,\" ex plains Hurtak, \"when energy wave bombardment pours in through the polar areas of the Earth.\" The electromotive fo rce is drawn off through the Electromagnetic 1746 Grid center s interfacing with the natural electric/telluric flows of the Earth's magnetic field (See Diagram 9). This interface was the intelligent positioning of "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 177 megalithic hardware (e.g., hollow, crystal-tipped, 100 foot-high pyramids) at key Grid junction boxes in a program of applied consciousness technology which re-arranged the indigenous magnetic field pattern into a workable energy Grid from which free and inexhaustible supplies could be drawn. This is the foundation of the Druidic sacred landscape science extolled by Michell. The Electromagnetic 1746 Grid is the planetary Grid Engineer's energy matrix blueprint, his Con Edison route map. The advanced crystal technology of Atlantis, for example, represented the \"home appliance\" that plugged into this free energy system drawing off virtually endless reserves of energy to empower civilization (the technological aspect) while furthering the spiritual evolution of humankind (the consciousness a s p e c t ) . 10 The electromotive force is not available, either functionally or conceptually, without this s p i ri t u al /s c ie n ti f ic f u s i o n expressed as consciousness technology and that comes from the proper understanding of the human/Grid interface. The Grid energy appliances were, and remain, a fusion as spiritual engineering. The Master Grid Engineers were, and remain, Knights of the Holy Grail. Thus the Grid is revealed as the context in which consciousness and technology are harmoniously integrated in a planetary Tai Ch'i for human and Earth enlightenment. In accordance with this simple electric motor model of the Earth Grid, the much-prophesised Earth Changes, possible geomagnetic field and pole reversal, even the apocalyptic Second Coming of Christ, are all nested within the function of the Grid commutator. Between geomagnetic field reversals, the Grid seems to function as a direct-current motor, with its steady stream of one-way electricity. But with the imminence of Earth Changes and field reversal, suddenly it seems that the Grid is actually an alternating-current motor, simply with long pauses between field reversals. A change in the polarity of the electric current flowing through the Grid commutator at Avebury fundamentally means the introduction of a new electromagnetic Light/Life/Consciousness spectrum for Earth, an upgrading of our physical life parameters by a literal electrification of matter---the biosphere, noosphere, and all our Grid bodies—into the fourth dimension, into the realm of anti-gravity.

It will happen unilaterally, instantaneously, "},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"178 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID synchronously. This is because the primary me ssage the realit y of the Grid is telling us is this: We are all one crystalline vibrational body—galaxy, solar system, Earth, human. The Human/Grid Interface When the Earth is comprehended as a receiving/transmitting crystal harmonic and a resonant facet in the solar crystal harmonic, a note in t he solar octave, then we need a unifying scheduling science with which to orient ourselves within this Grid totality. The precise science of astrolog y is the Viewer's Guide for daily Grid programming. The Ephemeris is the TV Guide for the Grid. What programs shall we wa tch as the world turns? What maudlin soaps shall we participate in as our King Sun plugs us into His daily melodrama? Astrology minutely calibrates the hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly cycles of t he planets—the movements of our orchestra. Through astrologi cally-attuned eyes, which is simply developing the interpretive aspect of astronomy, we can understand our lives, our world, our emotions, our movements, our reasons, habits, difficulties, and exaltations, according to this \"web of iron necessity,\" this whirling elemental energy dance of our interwired human/ solar psyche. The Polyhedronic Crystal Grid is like the master crystal chip that receives, through its 120 smooth triangular re ceptor plates, the myriad, though mathematically rational and orchestrated, energy/consciousness/Sound channelli ngs from our biopsychic disc jockeys. Thus the Ephemeris, with its factual tables of numbers and degrees, when proper ly applied, represents the Grid Engineer's codebook for predi cting, assessing , correcting, interpreting, and transmuting these steady, determining inputs from the solar radio station. Transmuting is the key. We can change the channel if we choose,turn down the volume,fine tune the specific radio band. The Grid Engineer has the potenti al for transmuti ng (freeing the inherent energy by releasing it from its form bondage) the solar/celestial energies by in telligent interfacing with the Electromagnetic 1746 Grid through any of the 144 planetary Round Table hologr ams, or terrestrial Zodiacs resident on Earth. This Grid, we must remember, is the Golden Alchemical Bowl of electromagnetic differ entiation, and the potential alembic of our transfiguration from gravitationa lly bonded humans to Humans of Light. Just because King Sun, our accustomed disc "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 179 jockey, plays his favorite tunes on his radio station, doesn't mean we have to, ultimately, always dance to that rhythm. The introduction of the reality of the local Zodiac workshops brings us to the crux of the possible interaction between the human and the Grid. This is where the Grid Engineer and Knight of the Holy Grail become one. This unification of seeking the Grail and serving the Grid is played out in the local geomythic theater of the landscape Zodiac. Geomythic means \"the living myth in the landscape\" and our direct involvement in this terrestrial symbology through a heightened consciousness interaction within a local Zodiac complex. Our Zodiac conceptual model again operates as an interdependent series of homologous and attuned dimensional systems i.e., Zodiacs within Zodiacs. We begin with the Master Solar Round Table of the Earth/Sun ecliptic through the twelve Houses of the Zodiac—every year, every 2160 years, every 25, 920 years. Here we have both King Sun and planet Earth circuiting the heavenly twelve-gated Grail Castle as intrepid, dedicated Grail Knights. This vast cycling, and questing, is translated, homologously, down to Earth, first, through Avebury as Grid switchboard and concert maistro, the master point for the 12 Oroboros Zodiac Lines, and, second, through the expansive planetary distribution of these 12 Dragon Lines,thereby making a Round Table of both Avebury Circle (condensed) and the entire planet Earth (expanded). But how does an individual Grail Knight voluntarily, consciously experience this huge planetary Round Table? And how does the Grid Engineer make intelligent, compassionate, and timely adjustments in the geomantic web of this vast-revolving solar table on Earth? Through the local Zodiac hologram. In this Zodiac model, an overlay of Qabala's Tree of Life with the mythic Round Table/Zodiac image is most illuminating. The Earth is one of the 12 resonating spheres, one of the 12 Round Table members, one of the 12 Notes in the solar octave, in the Solar Tree of Life. Thus we can picture these relations either in terms of the Tree or Round Table, which are essentially interchangeable for this illustration. Our Body of the Sun is expressed as a 12-sphered Tree of Life, with 12 Knights, or 12 Notes; Earth is Malkuth, the 10th Sephiroth, representing, appropriately, Earth (See Diagram 7; the 7th Sephiroth, Hod, for example, represents Mercury). Next, and similarly, the Earth Body is expressed as a Tree of Life, and here Mt. Shasta is Malkuth and Root chakra. The Gaia Tree has 12 spheres which in terms of the Grid are 12 Zodiac "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"180 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID Vortices, major planetary Zodiac domains which correspond in legend to the camps of the 12 Tribes of Israel. These are primary geomantic sectors each organised into a major Zodiac complex of 12 sub-Zodiac temples. The unification of these 12 Zodiac Vortices is the planetary Round Table, or Tree, as the whole family of Jacob (who was Is rael). Next, each of these 12 Zodiac Vortices has a subsystem of 12 Zodiac Domes, giving us a total of 144 Zodiac hologram temples on the planet (although all are not always available at one given time because of changing geologic/mete orologic conditions). Each of the 12 Zodiac Dome sub-systems comprises a Zodiac Vortex Round Table, of which there are 12 worldwide. For example, what I call the Hyperborean Round Table occupies an approximate area ranging from the Orkney Islands of northern Scotland, through Ireland, Wales, and England, to Brittainy and southwestern France. This Domed Zodiac Round Table includes 12 interdependent local Zodiac systems. Each has a dominant myth-system Logos but all are primarily constellated around King Arthur and the Grail. One of these 12 local Zodiacs is the somewhat familiar Glastonbury/Somerset \"Round Table of the Stars,\" as it's often called, or more poetically, The Region of the Summer Stars (which includes the famous mystical Avalon). Each local Zodiac (which may measure 10 miles in diameter, 20-30 miles in circumference) is topped and energized by a huge Zodiac Dome. Each local Zodiac, such as The Region of the Summer Stars, is a hologram of the solar Round Table in the form of 144 quasi-etheric star center effigies dimensionally overlaid like a stellar template on the physical landscape. The landscape Zodiac is a double ecliptic, with one physical ecliptic including 96 star effigies (from the northern hemisphere skies) and one etheric ecliptic including 48 star effigies (from the southern hemisphere skies). The two ecliptics interlock forming a vesica piscis with Glastonbury in its cradle. Within such a local Zodiac temple, a particular constellation, such as Canis Major (the Great Dog), will have an approximate material landscape reference point, a residence often reflected in place names, local legends, or actual landscape sculpturing, within or outside this defining ecliptic. In central Somerset, for example, within The Region of the Summer Stars, Canis Major is called \"The Girt Dog of Langport\" and occupies a geographic region about 5 miles long and 1 mile broad, and includes 16 recognizable star centers in its geomythic body.

Star centers are local geomythically-cast power points, usually marked by a dome cap, or line node, and sometimes with a full-fledged dome. Each of the constellations Above is overlaid, energetically, structurally, as a subtle, miniat ure star template of landscape star formations Below. Occasi onally the landscape, when seen from an airplane, does seem to resemble the mo rphology of a fish or goat or bull, but this is not essential by any means. The star centers repr esent dimensional doorways into the geomythic consciousness body of the particu lar Zodiac effigy whose being has cast an inviting shadow over the physical terrain. The local Earth Zodiac repr esents a basic consciousness workshop for human experience of the Grid of so lar energies that is the Solar Round Table, wh ich comprises our inner psychic three-dimensionally bounded life. The local Zodiac embodies, in miniature, the astr ophysical paramet ers etched in Earth and ether of the Star Evolution Grid and its 144 permutations, from the basic 12 octaval modulati ons. Each of the 144 Zodiacs has a different flavor, a different angle of vision, a different nuance and energy coloring. Why there are 144 is explained below. Through hologrammic miniatur ization, the local Zodiac makes the vast solar ecliptic Round Table accessible for human interaction and transmutation. The local Zodiac holds up before our meditative eyes a mirror made of geoma ncy for inner self-discovery. In circuiting the Zodiac temple we learn we are, psychically, made of the identic al resonance pattern as the solar system, and we thank our Zodiac hologram for clearly mirroring this rea lity for us. The Zodiac is a means for individual attunement with the Music of the Spheres, for hearing the subtle cosmic crys tal harmonics, orchestrated daily by the \"rushing sounds\" move ment of planets and stars, the Rhoizamata, as Pythagoras would say, which are always resonating within our atomic/molecular/consciousness environment, but just below the range of common hearing. The local Zodiac radio turns up the volume on this unending solar resonance so we can hear our stellar heartb eat.

Our Girt Dog of Langport happens to be, geomythically, t he canine psychopomp for the neophyte Grail Knight entering the starry Otherworld of the Zodiac temple, the spinning mystical Grail Castle. Mythologically, the Zodiac temple is the theater for the Grail Knight to seek, find, and fulfill the Grail Quest, which is none other than uncoverin g and opening the divine seed of Light and Spirit buried deep wi thin human consciou sness. The landscape Zodiac temple is energetically organised to facilitate this revelation. Our inner nature trul y lies among the stars. And Merlin, legendary Enchanter and Bard of Britain and King Arthur's Star Worker, was the master geomancer who dispatched the Grail Knights out to the star centers for visionary/integrative experiences, each according to the coincidence of their individual nat al charts, their own spiritual development status, and the larger astrological cycles—as mediated through the land scape Zodiac hologram. This is the moment in whic h the Grail Knight and Grid Engineer shake hands and act as o ne out in the Grid. The field of our psychophysical organism , the electromagnetic and bioplasmic structure, is inher ently linked into the Earth's electromagnetic and bioplasmic fields. When a human being inter-relates and unifies (thr ough meditation) at the right point in time and space (accor ding to the E phemeris time tables) on the surface of the Eart h (at the correctly chosen star center vortex), and in themse lves (in attunement with their overall program of spiritual unf oldment, as calibrated by their Master), and there is coincidenc e, then we have individual and planetary resonance. Then we have direct, tangible, experiential knowledge of the human place in the solar system. When we walk through the Zodiac Grid Do or into the realm of the Gods, we comprehend our true status in the solar paradigm. And that is to embody an d transfigure it all in the Human Body of Light. But how, exactly, does the m editating Grail Knight also function as Grid technician? Just as the Solar Logos is the Soul of the Being known as the so lar system, and just as the Planetary Logos is the Soul of Gaia, so the Grail stands for the potential for humans to know as the Soul. The Grail is an electromagnetic consciousness doorway within the human mind/body complex which opens th rough individuation of the psyche (i.e., the harmonious in tegration of the twelvefold Zodiac archetypes of the Sun) in to divinity. This is called by Qabalists the Adam Kadmon, the sacred temp late of human"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"184 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID perfection, the Edenic Light Body. The Grid, operating through its geomantically symbolic local star configurations, is a series of epiphanies, of harmonic unifications, octaval Notes of Trees within Trees, each sounding their note in a heavenly/terrestrial chorale. It proceeds step-by-step, beginning with the local Zodiac effigies. When Canis Major resonates within the Region of the Summer Stars Zodiac system, and when all 144 effigies within this Zodiac Dome are harmonised, then the system as a whole can resonate properly and fulfill its intended geometric place in the Zodiac octaval choir. When each of the 144 Zodiac Domes is harmonised, when the 12 Zodiac Vortices are resonating, then the global Round Table/Tree of Life through Avebury can sing within the choir of the solar system of which our Gaia is one sweetly singing voice. Thus is Gaia's position as Grail Knight at the King Sun's Round Table fulfilled and the solar harmonic completed. When the human, myth-living one's true identity as a star-compounded Grail Knight walking through the local Zodiac temple, unifies consciousness at a star center through a variety of means (e.g., meditation, chanting, singing, dancing, crystal focussing, directed breathing, group rituals, channelling higher beings, performing color visualizations), this brings the local aspect of the Electromagnetic 1746 Grid into clarity, focus, and harmony. Human and planetary energies are balanced through aware human participation at Grid nodes. When we comprehend the Grid as Gaia's immune and digestive system, and when we further consider the ubiquitous ecological disaster we have dumped in Her lap (not to mention the howling delusionary human astral plane we've created above the Earth like a permanent brown band of smog), then we can clearly see the urgency for purging, cleansing, and harmonising the Human/Gaia Being again. We are not separate: Gaia's ecology is our spirituality; Her imbalance is our psychosis. It's a question of reciprocal maintenance. As we maintain the Mother, so we maintain ourselves, Her children. As we purify Her body, so we cleanse our own. As we feed Her, so She feeds us. As the British geomancer Reshad Feild notes, \"Although this grid system exists in the natural world, it,too, is made for man and woman, and so the necessary work of transformation has to go 'through' the vehicle of the human being.\" 14 This is true planetary ecology, love for the \"Earth Household\", because it recognizes the indivisible bond between Earth and Human, House and Resident, Mother and Child, as mediated through our homologous Grid bodies.

The Enlightening of Adam The landscape temple made of stones and crystal, positioned at Dome centers, divinely empowered by the Elohim in concordance with the Elemental Kingdom, and ritually inhabited by consciously breathing humans, linked Heaven and Earth through Man. The terrestrial temple also functioned as a Grid Door by which human consciousness, initially bounded by the Earth's gravitational/consciousness field, could actually exit this plane and enter \"the realm of the Gods.\" Through this Grid Door, the Gods could also channel their spiritual vibrations and messages. The ancient ziggurat, for example, was a Grid Door or Heaven/Earth mediator. The Akkadian/Babylonian name was zukiratu, which connoted \"tube of divine spirit;\" while in the Sumerian tongue, ziggurats were called ESH, which meant \"supreme\" or \"most high\" or \"heat source\". Moreover the ziggurat at legendary Nippur (at the northern confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers) was considered the Gods' headquarters, called KI.UR (or DUR.AN.KI) which meant \"place of Earth's root\" and \"the place where the bond between Heaven and Earth rose\", the place where there was a \"hea venward tall pillar reaching to the sky.\" 15 Clearly such a place was a major Dome center for Sumerian culture. As the Irish myths attest, the sidhe, or raised stone-and-earth barrow, was the home of the Tuatha de Danann, the sanctified, potent residence of the ancient Gods. Domed Newgrange, the Brugh na Boinne, was their principal home in old Ireland. The Gods, through their residences, were the source of wisdom for early reverential humankind,and while the Gods may have occupied their etheric palaces at the Dome centers, humans meanwhile, and afterwards, constructed physical temples to mark the spots and serve as a two-way swinging door. So the Domes which brought Love from Above for Gaia's meridians, also brought wisdom to Adam, the early man/woman inhabitant. The Domes were the source of wisdom, the wise domes. Megalithic culture was a sacred milieue best described as magelithic, meaning the time of the Magus Stones. But the agents of the Wise Domes, the Stone Magi (or Magicians), after "},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"186 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID a time judged it better to not leave their signature too prominently and removed the letter e, leaving us wisdom. But even in their omission did they leave their handwriting, for the e that was removed from the wise domes is the e of Elohim. The Elohim also left the consciousness technology in place to facilitate the human retrie val of their angelic wisdom through the interdimensional structures positioned at the Dome sites. Stone Age indeed! The Elohim left a major calling card at Avebury, not the least tarnished after many milennia. Just as Avebury is central to the nature and operation of the Earth Grid, so it was, and remains, pivotal in the appearance (and eventual reawakening) of Adam, the firs t collective manifestation of physically individuated woman and man on Earth. When we understand Avebury a little better, we can begin to answer the fundamental questions underlying all this complexity of life: Why is there a Grid at all? Why is there an Earth? Why is there human life? Avebury Circle originally had 94 stones, of which 72 were created by the Elohim, and 22 were later imported from elsewhere. Encircling the Avebury Circle is a massive ditch (about 30 feet deep) bordered on both sides by an embankment. The ditch is like a huge groove running around the Circle; it has an intensely feminine vibration, like a river of soft silent light flowing whitely through the earthen channel, like a susurrus between embankments. Walking slowly through the ditch one senses the primal Mother is whispering here to her Children of the Circle. At Avebury Circle the earth has been taken out of a whole and removed. We can look at the circle as a giant record. The ditch is the groove on the record. If we play the record with the needle of our Spirit, then we hear some \"hi fi\" angelic music. The 94 stones are the amplifiers for the music. The Stone Circle is thus an outdoor cosmic sound system, the site of the original Rock concerts. Here we have the concept of geomantic harmonics at work. The stone circle has a specific pre-encoded resonance harmonic, a specific musically-enscribed message, or Song. The composite shape of the circle represents a frozen cymatic sculpture, a permanent landscape stereo record from the Spirit. The stone circle embodies a Tone dropped into the ethers of the Earth then molded terrestrially into a playable record. The ditch is the primary record groove, and the first wave trough emanating from the place where the \"stone\" tone was originally dropped into the site (i.e.,the center of the circle). The Dome overhead is the bell that carries the tone when \"struck\" from "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 187 Above by the musician. The Dome site channels this Tone through its geomantically calibrated musical instrument, the stone circle, and the encircling stones are the \"wrap-around sound\" loudspeakers. The particular size and structural complexity of the megalithic stone record is directly related to the evolutionary importance of the Sound recorded. The truly biggest hit tunes get the largest diameter stone circles. Avebury is thus one of Gaia's largest stone records, occupying an area in Wiltshire of 28 1/2 acres, with a ditch circumference of 4/5 mile. The 17th century British antiquarian John Aubrey, writing of Avebury, declared, \"Avebury doth as much exceed Stonehenge in grandeur as a Cathedral doth an ordinary Parish Church.\" The 20th century British scholar Harold Bayley (writing in The Lost Language of Symbolism, 1913) corroborated Aubrey's enthusiasm, announcing \"The English Temple of Abury (sic) ty pified not only Time but also the greater Absolute, the all-embracing and more awe-full Soul of time, the axis of Existence.\" Why is Avebury so important? All the ley lines, it seems, lead to Avebury. All the energy in the Grid is focussed at Avebury Circle, our planetary Grid umbilicus. The purpose of Avebury is tuning human consciousness to its purpose on Earth. At Avebury resides the Earth-expression of the blazing Seed of divine Light. Within the human body, as the Grail Knight discovers, resides this same Light Seed, this fire of the Spirit, which we call the Nimitta or Blazing Star 16 . This Seed, whether within the human or at Avebury, is the same Blazing Star. It is the same blazing crystal Seed from which both Gaia and Adam were physically born, birthed by the Elohim, whom Genesis, in the standard confusing and exoteric translations, calls God. More properly, the Elohim are God's agents, the Sons of Light, and the agents of our local creation. This fundamental aspect of the Grid and human life will make more sense when we examine a few key words. Avebury, Adam, and Elohim, are coded symbolic words created by the Elohim through the sacred language of Qabala (which matches letters with numbers, i.e., gematria). ADAM (1.4.40, technically written as ADM) means \"the Aleph (A.1.) buried in the Blood of Earth (DAM, 4.40).\" Aleph here means the Blazing Star of the eternal Spirit, the universal flame of the Nimitta, implanted as an imperishable seed of Light within the human body of clay and blood (DAM). In other words, the Kingdom of Heaven blazes within us as this Star (Aleph). AVEBURY is the place (BRY, 2.200.10) where the Aleph was implanted ( or buried) in Mo ther (AVE, 1.6.1) Earth. Avebury "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"188 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID is the Mother's Village, the place of the Mother's berry, or seed. Avebury, as the inner heart of Gaia, was Adam's heart/womb door, the terrestrial place where Adam first came into Earth incarnation from the Garden of Eden Above. Adam arrived with the Blazing Star burning like a blinding furnace within his/her mind/body complex. Adam appeared on Earth through Avebury as a terrific flame of Heaven walking in the form of the human. Avebury remains the place we can go to on Earth to remember our fiery, spiritual arrival on the planet. ELOHIM, an angelic hierarchy, were the Creator Gods for Adam and Gaia, the master mancers of geo and soma. Elohim implemented the translation of the Blazing Star from the spiritual realms into the sentient, organic, evolving life form of Adam, following the same homology whereby the Aleph was clothed in planet Earth, becoming our sentient, organic, evolving life form of Gaia. Elohim, in a sense, supervised and midwived the co-creation of Adam and Gaia as homologous beings. Let's examine this still more closely. This will clarify our composite model of the Grid, Earth, Adam, and Elohim. Light, in Qabala, is AWR or 1.62 (Technically, it's 1.6.200, but final zeros are redundant). AVE the Mother is 1.61. The phi ratio of the light spiral is 1.61 (or, precisely, 1.618034, which can be rounded off to 1.62). Earth and Adam have a mathematically homologous relationship whereby ADAM is 144 and Earth, through its Grid (i.e., Electromagnetic 1746 Grid, the Golden Bowl, and Christ Body) is 1746. Both numbers are related through the phi ratio. The Silver Cord, the primary dual-weaved umbilical electrical cable entering Avebury, is comprised of 666 (the solar Father of Light, the Seed, the Nimitta, Aleph, or Blazing Star,and golden line) and 1080 (the lunar Mother of Forms, and silver line). Their relation as polarised light (666/1080, positive/negative) is expressed as phi 1.61 while their summation is 1746, also a function of phi. We have, then, Light (AWR 1.62) moving through the umbilicus as Electricity (positive/negative charges, expressed as 666/1080) and manifesting as Electromagnetism (the polarised north/south nodes of the 1746 Electromagnetic Grid, as manifested through the yin/yang qualities of the 12 Oroboros Lines). This channelling of Light to Electricity to Electromagnetism births physical Life, expressed as Adam and Gaia, as the bioorganic theater for their interplay, as mediated through the Megalithic Grid. Earth, incidentally, is written in Qabala as ARTZ ( or ERTZ,"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 189 1.200.90, or 291, whose digits total 12, the prime number of the Oroboros Grid and Zodiac Temple), In terms of mythology, the Mother of Forms (1080) creates the Holy Grail to contain the Father's Seed of Light (666, Blazing Star), while the Elohim (angelic Grail Maidens) bring the Grail (now 1746, both Seed and Vessel) down to Earth (ARTZ, the 12-sided Grail Castle) for Adam (144), the Grail Knight and Grail Bearer. But what creates the Light originally? What starts this whole generative procession culminating in Adam walking the Earth bearing the Grail? Undifferentiated, undivided, inexhaustible, unfathomable Love from Above. Adam is the key to unlocking the secret of this light harmonic. The New Zealand Grid theorist Bruce Cathie speculates that \"All the mathematical evidence so far indicates that the maximum number of individual elements to be found in the universe will be 144.\" Each element can have, theoretically, 6 isotopes, making 864 possible combinations. Cathie proposes \"144 octaves of separate substances\" in which an octave is comprised of an element family of 6 isotopes each. Each electron cloud, or shell, as it expands outwards from the atomic nucleus, can accomodate a maximum of 8 electrons. Thus each shell expansion is a function of 8 (the original basis of the octave) and forms a new electron shell. This Cathie calls the \"harmonic zone\" or \"light harmonic\" totalling 144. \"The light harmonic is then equal and the cycle has been completed. The whole series is a repetition of octaves of wave forms\" whereby physical reality is \"manifested by the concentrated interlocking of harmonic wave-forms.\" 17 This is clearly controversial yet keenly intriguing. To date 107 elements have been discovered; this leaves 37 undetected, or should we more accurately say, \"as yet unmanifested ?\" The number 144, we've seen, is pivotal in the Grid and Adam. A closer look at our key numbers will amplify Cathie's suggestions. How can we arrive at 144 elements? Let's postulate 18 solar octaves, as representing the maximum expressive potential of the solar Father (666, whose digits total 18) acting on the material archetypal Forms of the Mother. From the Mother of Forms, say the Qabalists, issues the heavenly Chariot (The Mother's sphere, Binah, the third Sephiroth, manifests the Hhayt. 8, a downward manifesting pathway called in Tarot the Chariot [See Diagram 7]). The Chariot of Hhayt. 8 refers to the maximum number of electrons in an atomic shell thereby comprising an element as the fundamental form. Now, let's rearrange the Periodic Table of the Elements, momentarily, and "},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"190 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID postulate 8 families of elem ents, each occupying 3 solar octaves. By the mathematics of light (18 x 8) we have the full light harmonic, 144, expressed as Adam, on Earth. Thus Adam 144, as a sentient, organic life form comprises, the full expressive potential for the 144 elements in this universe. The 144 elements, themselves, represent the dramatic interplay (based on phi 1.61, as the unfolding physics of Light) of the Father 666 and Mother 1080. Their combined electrical impulse 1746 (i.e., the Grail with the Blazing Star inside) is the spark within the form of Life, for Adam and Earth. And in either case, the Elohim are the quantum midwives, heavenly benefactors, and, literally, God-parents of this grand astrophysical experiment. This complex, terrestrial dram a all reduces to the number 9, called Tayt in Qabala. All the key numbers in this Light interplay of Earth, Adam, and the Grid, it seems, digitally total 9: 1746, 144, 1080, 666, 864, 83,808 (possible planetary dome caps), 20,736 (number of planetary Zodiacs multiplied by number of star effigies in each). Even affiliate numbers all point to 9: 86,400 (average human heartbeats/day), 25,920 (number of years in one Great Zodiac Year), 4,320,000 (years in the Mahayuga, the Hindu cosmic time cycle)—not to mention the 9 month gestation time for humans. What, then, is the 9 that pervades the inner structure of the Grid? We must turn to the Qabala for illumination of the 9. Tayt.9 represents the archetype of the primeval \"feminine\" formative energy, which draws upon the Hhayt. 8 (the storage sphere, or Chariot), of all undifferentiated energy, which derives from Binah (the Sephiroth of the Mother of Forms) to build structures. Tayt. 9 is the elementary \"Female\", the prodigious proliferator of elementary form units, individual cells, expressive composites created from the Mother's electron clusters of Hhayt 8. In Qabala Tarot symbolism (Tarot is a pictorial system directly related to the Tree of Life as a visual/intuitive series of life/drama depictions affiliated, in part, with the 22 pathways) Tayt. 9 is the Path of \"Strength of the Lion.\" Each pathway on the Tree is \"ruled\" by a Zodiac House; Tayt. 9 is ruled by Leo, which in turn is ruled by the Sun. Tayt. 9 is often depicted in Tarot symbology as the Scarlet Woman (alive with the fire of Life) and is pictured as an ecstatic, nearly drunken, lascivious, scarlet-clothed, and most powerful primal woman astride a Lion/Serpent, holding its jaws open in triumph. In world mythologies, 9 is the number of \"the Goddess Mother of the World,\" the \"Great Goddess of Many Names,\" She who is Matrix of the cosmic life process, and, in Greece, it was "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 191 the number of the Nine Muses, Daughters of Mnemosyne (Memory, i.e., Binah). But what is the Strength of the Lion that our archetypal generatrix is riding triumphantly? Qabala symbolism interprets the Lion variously. Regulus, the heart of the Lion, is the brightest star in that constellation and Leo was anciently regarded as the beginning of the Zodiac Round. The Lion also represents the first formation of the human individuality projected into the world of Form (Geburah, 5th Sephiroth) from the realm of the Spirit (Chesed, 4th Sephiroth). The Lion, says J.J. Hurtak, represents our Star Evolution, King Sun. Thus the entire solar reality, the Drama of the Nine, of our local Star Evolution system, is mathemat ically encoded into the light harmonic of Adam, Earth, Grid. The 9 is the Logos of our Sun, his metaphysical calling card, his secret telephone number. We have, then, the physics, geometry, and gematria of the specific light harmonic (the solar octaves) of our King Sun, encoded synchronously and thoroughly throughout all form manifestations in our world, within all dramatis personae (like an ineradicable blood type or permanent thumbprint) of his solar Crystal Theater. Through our human lives as the Mother's Children on Earth, our local Mother, we myth-live, as divinely made holograms, the Light valency, or Mind/Body/Spirit, of our solar system, Tayt. 9, the Strength of the Lion. This is the Drama of the Nine in short form: The (Love from Above) Light (AWR, 1.61, the Logos of Light, phi) Harmonic ( E l e c t r i c i t y , phi differentiated as 666/1080, into positive/negative charges) Expressed (through the Elohim, the angelic verb, agents of the implant ation of archetypal life into temporal form) as Adam (144, the human electromagnetic fulfillment of all elemental expressive potentiality, as 18 solar octaves x 8 element families) on Earth (ARTZ, 291=12, the 12-fold Zodiac/Round Table/Planetary Grid matrix). Thus do the Wise Domes of the Elohim teach us of the Lion's Play and purpose of Earth, Adam, and our loving bond, the Grid. Adam's Geomancy So Hermes throws the ball back to us. As humans we must all become geomancers for our Mother, Gaia, and for ourselves, Adam. At the beginning of Time on Earth, the great geomancer Hermes arrived with the Elohim, the Sons of Light and Biblical \"Giants in the Earth,\" and established the Global Hermetic Megalithic Calendar—the Grid. The Elohim further arranged for "},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"192 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID the human psyche to resonate in harmony with the Music of the Spheres as broadcast through our local twelvefold solar Round Table and as received through many radios of the templic stone grid. This was, supposedly, at the time of the second Dome Presence, just before Adam's Drama of the Nine was about to be staged. The Grid temple was designed to achieve the necessary biopsychic nexus between Heaven and Earth as embodied, as lived, as walked by Adam on Earth. Thus Adam and Gaia were set in balance in an inextricable bond, as homologous manifestations and groundings of the same fundamental phi spiral of Light. The human psyche was wired into the Grid which itself was wired for sound as a sonic hologram of the Solar Logos. The planetary Grid and its local miniaturizations was the model/blueprint/directions for Home, Enlightenment, and Paradise. Through the Grid, Gaia and Adam were held in living harmony within the greater body of the solar system. Thus we got off to a terrific start. After a while, the Elohim/Giants and their Domes departed. We were on our own. Human geomancers, trained under Hermes, and in cooperation with the Elemental Kingdom, assumed responsibility for Grid maintenance (which is to say, really, for individual and communal enlightenment) althou gh they could still rely on assistance from Above—first, from the Elohim, who had returned to angelic form and residence, and second, from the widespread extra-planetary network of benevolent Space Brothers. The presumed high civ ilization of Atlantis was the site of the Planetary College of Grid Magnetics graduating a succession of expert geomancers. The twelve-tiered Atlantean Temple of Oralin was geomancy headquarters, like a Pentagon for magnetic sciences. Here geomancers and magnetics technicians conducted continual analyses of Grid conditions, monitored terrestrial/solar energy fields, designed and installed various geomantic engineering instruments—-all as part of an overall program of maintaining a harmonious and fruitful planetary Grid system for the benefit of all beings. We might construe these ultrascientific Atlantean Grid technicians as the archetypal computerized Druids, for even in later times, after the collapse of Atlantean high culture, the legendary Druids maintained the wisdom of the Grid and kept it in balance. The Druids fine-tuned the Earth Radio through all Her Dome receptor/dial sites and myriad transmission wires. The Druid geomancers kept Gaia's biosphere humming with a steady stream of life-supporting, life-enriching, life-evolving energy transmissions from Above. "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 193 The Druids and Atlanteans understood well the reciprocal agreement. Through Hermes, Adam learned the divination of the Earth, the secrets of geomancy. But through Adam, Hermes expected the reciprocal divinization of the Earth through intelligent, loving application of geomancy. Why? Because, fundamentally, this program of reciprocal maintenance would bring about the mutual enlightenment of Mother Earth and Child Adam, which is what the Elohim intended, as part of the Master Plan, for this particular astrophysical experiment on Earth. Gaia, through Her Grid, maintains our Blazing Star. We, through our geomancy, maintain Gaia's Blazing Star. But why need we be concerned today, in our comfortable Western society of personal computers, credit cards and new Volvos? Why should we bother with all this ancient history and idealistic grandeur from a remote Druidic past? Because many interlocking universal, galactic, solar, planetary, and human evolutionary cycles are all synchronously coming to fruition and conclusion at this the end of the 20th century. Certain basic incarnational obligations all humans willingly agreed to, long ago, as a condition for inhabiting the Earth, have all come due. It's not a question of \"the wrath of the Gods\" or an \"angry,displeased Jehovah\". It's simply a matter of cosmic clockwork. A major cycle is nearly finished. New things are about to begin. All old business must be cleared up quickly. This kind of Grid teleology will assume sharper focus when we examine two further aspects of the Grid. Planet Earth, within the theory of chakras, is the Muladhara Root Chakra in the Body of the Solar Logos. If we picture the solar system as a huge human-like figure, Earth sits very materially in the scrotum as the root energy center. The entire Earth Grid, in fact, is actually an organic multitiered model of the energy dynamics of a solar root chakra, functioning for the Sun just as Mt. Shasta functions for Gaia. What is the significance of the root chakra? Sleeping within Gaia is the Goddess Kundalini, the tremendous creative, evolutionary spiritual energy that transfigures, when activated, the entire 7 chakra system—of the human, the Earth, the solar system. Kundalini, the Indian Tantric texts inform us, is \"She who maintains all the beings of the world by means of inspiration and expiration and (who) shines in the cavity of the root Lotus like a chain of brilliant lights.\" Moreover, Goddess Kundalini \"is the receptacle of that continuous stream of ambrosia which flows from the Eternal Bliss. By Her radiance it is that the whole of this universe and this Cauldron is illumined.\" 19 The sequence of chakra openings"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"194 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID is reckoned as 2 through 7, then back to the root, from which the aroused Kundalini arises in a fiery burst like the soaring serpent and flames up the sushumna through the chakras illuminating everything with a divine light beyond brilliance. This is Gaia's potential and Her expected role in our local solar system. Planet Earth is also the final Word in the Secret Name of God, called in Qabala, Tetragrammaton, the Word of Four Letters, i.e., YHWH (Yod-He-Wod-He, or Yahweh, or Jehovah, in translation). The Solar Logos, as we mentioned, can be modelled as a Tree of Life with Earth at Malkuth, the 10th Sephiroth. The Tetragrammaton in part pertains to that composite ineffable resonance, or harmonic, of all levels of expression of this Tree. This includes the Four Elements (fire, air, water, earth) in all their dimensions of subtle and physical expression. The Father of Light (Chokmah) is Yod; the Mother of Forms (Binah/Saturn) is He (pronounced Hay ); the Soul of Adam (Tiphareth/Sun) is Wod; and Earth, the Body of Adam (Malkuth/Earth) is the final He. The Earth is a Perpetual Choir in the solar system orchestra. Just as one stone circle on Earth is a cosmic Record, angelically recorded for Man, and just as individual stone circles are instrumental member s of the planetary orchestra and all performing their parts of the overall solar symphony, so Gaia Herself is a planetary Record for those Above. Gaia is one Note singing proudly in the infinite space, finding its intended, necessary, and appropriate niche in the Music of the Spheres. When all the stone circle records are attuned, when the 12 Oroboric Lines resonate in equal measure through Avebury Circle, and when the necessary crystalline spirit needles are positioned throughout the Earth Record, then Gaia can sing He to the angels in Heaven. This is the meaning of reciprocal harmonics. This is Adam's Geomancy. When Gaia sounds Her He in the Choir of the solar system, then the solar harmonic is completed. Then the solar octave is registered, every note, and altogether. Then everything begins to vibrate at a faster rate and the Solar Logos sounds His Note in the Galactic Choir—and so forth, into Infinity, as far as we're concerned. This is why all the attention is focussed today on the Earth, on Her Grid. This is why the Space Brothers touch down so visibly into our third dimension, why so much interdimensional channelling (from Ascended Masters and angels, in particular) is happening today, why the Angelic Kingdom is returning to credible human awareness, why the Grid is coming into focus. "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 195 Everyone is waiting for us. The Earth is one note in the solar choir. When Earth sounds Her He in the Choir, the light harmonic of this Star Evolution will be completed, in turn co mpleting a more exalted light harmonic of which it is a part. The Earth and our King Sun are about to receive a major solar/spiritual initiation, one which will inaugurate a new Light valency, a new electromagnetic spectrum, which will be experienced by us as a quantum leap away from materializ ed consciousness into the free-floating fourth dimension. This may sound remote, abstract, and unbelievable, too far away from ley lines, and therefore not worthy of our concern. Why should we be concerned, anyway? Some time ago, it is believed, Hermes handed over his role as Gaia's Master Geomancer to his spiritual brother, the Archangel Michael. Michael, among other responsibilities, is called The Keeper of the Secrets of the Relations between Heaven and Earth; He is also the Tone Bearer for Earth and the Standard Bearer for the Christ, who is Adam's full potential, the source of the hologram of the Human. Michael approaches Gaia now with his Sword of Spirit poised for the initiatory stroke. Already He has touched Gaia at the apex of Her fire/tetrahedron at Mt. Balsam Cone, North Carolina. Gaia's inner heart at Avebury is scheduled for imminent reactivation. The Grid, under structural reassessment, is also about to be \"switched back on\", full power, but at a higher vibrational rate. Theoretically, the Domes and Elohim will return. The ancient British festival of Michael Mass (known traditionally as Michaelmas, September 29) will be radically enriched in planetary meaning. Both Gaia and Adam will remember the Blazing Star set as an imperishable Seed of Knowing and Bliss within their planetary and human bodies. We must again embody Adam (as the Blazing Star buried in the Blood of Earth) inhabiting Gaia (as the Blazing Star buried in the Clay of the Mother). What will happen then? Anti-gravity! There will be a new Light/Life spectrum for Adam and Gaia, resulting in a change in, even transcendence of, the ancient gravitational field holding us down with iron guy-wires to the physical plane of Earth awareness. Recently a new elementary substance was discovered; it was found to have possible anti-gravity properties and was named levitonium. The scientists speculated that levitonium might be capable of powering rockets out of the Earth's gravitational field.

Levitony is a species of giddiness inspired by the angels—Elohim, if you like. It is an attitude, perhaps archetypal, of giggling detachment that lifts us right off the Earth in a free-floating feather of amusement and mirth, defying gravity, defeating the seriousness, the weightiness, the heaviness, of Earth life as we know it---those f a m i l i a r \"astrophysical consciousness parameters\". Levitony, I suggest with a cirrus-like grin,is native to our constitution, something we were naturally born with. With the bouyancy of levitony we will glide in Adam's transfigured Light Body high above dear Gaia and we will note She, too, is again looking pristine and sparkling in Her blazing light. She, too, once again, has become our Garden of Eden.

A method of octave expansion and octave reduction was used to determine the specific frequency of a note. When this theory is applied to the relationshi ps of countries to sounds, a way of increasing harmony between countries can be suggested by knowing a key note of the dist ance between them. A correspondence with Pythagorean Lam bdoma of seven rays is suggested. In September of 1983 I received a letter from Gove rnors State University in Illinois requesting submission of in- formation or research on a project called THE PLANETARY GRID SYSTEM. 1 wrote back a note saying that perhaps I could help by identifying the musical interv al of the modular grid system if there is a module that has been determined in length. Then, a year later in December, 1984, Bethe Hagens and William Becker sent a copy of the magazine Pursuit' which featured their research. And in this article the distances in miles of the grid system they devised was given, so that I could get to work to determine certain musical relationships. I sent a let- ter detailing these relati onships. After receiving my letter Bethe Hagens replied: Thank you so much for your letter. I wanted you to know that we had received it. I am kind of stunned by what you have found in the grid — and your political interpretations. It's one of the most fascinating responses we've ever received. I don't know that I told you, but I am a profes- sional violinist when I am not being an anthropologist. Your work in harmonics begins to get at something I have felt intuitively must exist but had no way to express. . . . I have not had the time to sit with your le tter and really absorb it. I will write again once I have something intelligent to say. Again, thanks so much for writing. The Becker-Hagens report presented a theory of the growing structure of the earth, from the tetrahedron, oc- tahedron, cube, icosahedron, and dodecahedron. These are the Platonic solids attributed to Pythagoras (500 B.C.). The dodecahedron and icosahedron together, Becker and Hagens found to be the grid system of our pre- sent age. When the line arrays of each of these soli ds is overlaid on a sphere, a grid emerges which they contend is a pattern the ancient peoples us ed for becoming one with the earth. 2 Briefly, factors to consider when calculating the harmonic implicati ons between countri es, cities, or villages in- clude the following: • What is the great circle distance in m iles between two points on the grid system? • What are the major apex points? • Is the assumption that Giza is the major point valid, or has the energy changed since the building of the Great Pyramid? • Are significant places in history nodes of the grid system? • Are fault lines energy lines? • Are mountain ranges energy lines? • What is the difference between the fault lines and the mountain range lines in terms of energy? • Could certain distances portend probl em areas in terms of harmonies? The Becker-Hagens report mentioned the Twelve Devils' Graveyards Around the World (Saga Magazine, 1972) where magnetic and energy aberrations were located. These are found zig-zaging the equator at 30 degrees above and 30 degrees below the equator. Using an \"Atlas\" software computer program, Robert Foulkrod found the distance in miles to be 4264 miles between adjacent \"Graveyards.\" The corresponding musical frequency based on the speed of sound in air is 0.0000502 cps. By octave expansion to the middle \"C\" octave (multiplying by 2 to the \"n\" number of times), this translates to a musical note of \"A\". This particular distance or musical note might be an indication of disharmony between countries, if , indeed, distance is a factor.

Therefore the musical sound of \"F\" at 345 cps might be accentuated for harmony between these two countries. The Becker-Hagens report mentioned the theory by Sinkiewitz who claimed that the present energy grid sytem is out of alignment with the ancient grid system, and that New Age Spiritual communities around the globe are rediscovering the new grid and build ing sacred sites to activate them. The Aleutian Islands have been predicted to be th e new North Pole. See Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5. What is the distance involved when a diamond of a 70 degree apex is overlaid on the new North Pole, and the legs of the dia- mond terminate at the Eq uator?

Some Visual Ways of Interpreting musical intervals, as a prelude to applying to planetary grid system. "},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" The method of determining the frequency of a distance is based on formula in physics which is stated in the letter to Becker-Hagens. v = fw where v = (1130) the velocity of sound in air at room temperature in ft/sec, f = frequency in cycles/sec or Hertz w = wavelength or distance in feet. Because of the nature of the inverse properties of wavelength and frequency, the frequency and wavelength can be found if one knows the speed of sound for the material through which the sound travels. Through the oceans the speed of sound would be faster and hence create a different musical note. The speed could have been taken to be the speed of sound th rough granite for mountainous ridges, and a different velocity in valleys, which would be of a less dense material . In valleys sound would travel slower than in the mountains, and slower still in air. One could a ssume that in earthquake faults the sound would travel even faster as the den- sity of the entire earth would be a factor, it would seem , if in fact the earth is denser and not hollow. If the earth were hollow, as has been presented by some, sound would not travel in a vacuum, and would turn to light, since light and sound are on the same spectrum separate d only by our measuring sound in frequency and light in wavelength. Light would travel faster in a vacuum, slower in air, slower still in water and become sound in a dense, non-transparent medium. The note relating two cities or sites can readily be determined by the formula described earlier. When a third city or site is added one can readily determine whether the three are in harmonic accord by using a long forgotten method of determining geometrically and algebrai cally the arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means. To illustrate, take the distance from a to b to be a given length in miles, then take a distance from one of these sites to another. Put the resulting lengths end to e nd, bisect them and draw a circle from the halfway mark. Draw a line orthogonal to the diameter of the circle at the point on th e line of the first city or site. Where this line meets the circle determines the geometric mean. Then draw a line from this point on the circle to the center of the circle. This is the arithmetic mean, and the radius of the circle. Drawing a line orthogonal to this radius stret- ching to the first site defines the harmonic mean. These distances can be translated into sounds which would be harmonious with each one of the cities. For example, let us take the distance between Gome l and Timbuktu of 1400 miles, and Timbuktu to Great Zimbebwe of 2200. Lets add these in one line maki ng a total of 3600 miles, which bisected equals 1800 miles."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The arithmetic mean would equal 1800 miles a \"B \" musically.

The length betw een the first two cities of 1400 is an \"E flat\", and the length between the second and third cities of 2200 is an \"A flat\". The cities exhibit an interval of a fourth bet- ween them or \"A\" to \"E flat\", whic h is a common harmonic used musically.

See Figure 6, References 3 through 8. The apex of the Lambdoma diagram is divided equally as the diagonal down the center of the x and y axis. The diagonal has a ra tio of 1:1, so that whatever the distance is along the diagonal of the grid would be its \"key note\". For example Gomel in the Becker-Hagens grid has seven rays radiating from the apex point, and the diagonal which represents the \"key note\" extends from Gomel to El Eglab, 2600 miles, an \"F\" musically. From Ca iro to London is 2183 miles, a \"G#\". Each of the rays of the grid would exhibit a uni que energy, and much work has to be done to determine the quality of these differing energies.

First, recognizing that harmonies between cities or countries is based upon attunement to each other's energy patterns. Most of all let us attune ourselves to the earth's energies, recognizing the oneness of all things in our material universe, and learning the importance of sound as a manifest ation of different realities. Any grid system has to have distance as one of the factors, since wavelength is inherent in all sound vibrations, as the inversion of frequency. Even though we cannot hear the specific frequency of a grid line, the interval quality is present though inaudible. So lets make them audible.

After obtaining a tr anslation by a German journalist, in English, I was amazed at the informa tion contained in the story, and was surprised that the article had slipped through the suppression net which tends to keep such knowledge from leaking out to the public. All the similar types of stories that I had read up until now were generally devoid of specific information necessary to prove the veraci ty of the account. In this case a full set of geometric measurements were ta ken, and I discovered, to my great delight, that when they were converted into their equivalent geodetic measures, relating to grid harmonics the values gave a direct association with those in the unified harmonic equations published in my earlier works. The following extracts are translations taken from the German article: 'We know from the priests of the far east that they were able to lift heavy boulders up high mountains with the help of gr oups of various sounds... the knowledge of the various vibrations in the audio range demonstrates to a scientist of physics that a vibrating and condensed sound field can nullify the power of gravitation. Swedish engineer Olaf Alexanderson wrote about this phenomenon in the publication. Implosion No. 13. The following report is based on obser vations which were made only 20 years ago in Tibet. I have this report from civil engineer and flight manager, Henry Kjelson, a friend of mine. He la ter on included this report in his book, The Lost Techniques. This is his report: A Swedish doctor, Dr Jarl, a friend of Kjelsons, studied at Oxford. During those times he became friends with a young Tibetan student. A couple of years later, it was 1939, Dr Jarl made a journey to Egypt for the English Scientific Society. There he was seen by a messenger of his Tibetan friend, and urgently requested to come to Tibet to treat a high Lama. After Dr Jarl got the leave he follo wed the messenger and arrived after a long journey by plane and Yak caravans, at the monastery, where the old Lama and his friend who was now holding a high position were now living. Dr Jarl stayed there for some time, and because of his friendship with the Tibetans he learned a lot of things that other foreigners had no chance to hear about, or observe. One day his friend took him to a place in the neighbourhood of the monastery and showed h i m a sloping meadow which was surrounded in the north west by high cliffs. In one of the rock walls, at a height of about 250 metres was a big hole which looked l i k e the entrance toa cave. In front of this hole there was a platform on which the monks were building a rock wall. The only access to this platform was from the top of the cliff and the monks lowered themselves down with the help of ropes. In the middle of the meadow, about 250 metres from the cliff, was a polished slab of rock with a bowl like cavity in the centre. The bowl had a diameter of one metre and a depth of 15 centimetres. A block of stone was manoeuvred into this cavity by Yak oxe n. The block was one metre wideand "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"214 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID one and one-half metres long. Then 19 mu sical instruments were set in an arc of 90 degrees at a distance of 63 metr es from the stone slab. The radius of 63 metres was measured out accurately. The musical instruments consisted of 13 drums and six trumpets. (Ragdons). Eight drums had a cross-section ot on e metre, and a length of one and one- half metres. Four drums were medium size with a cross-secion of 0.7 metre and a length of one metre. The only sm all drum had a cross-section of 0.2 metres and a length of 0.3 metres. All the trumpets were the same size. They had a length of 3.12 metres and an opening of 0.3 metres. The big drums and all the trumpets were fixed on mounts which c ould be adjusted with staffs in the direction of the slab of stone. The big drums were made of 3mm thick sheet iron, and had a weight of 150 kg. They were built in five sections. All the drums were open at one end, while the other end had a bottom of metal, on which the monks beat with big leather clubs. Behind each instrument was a row of monks. The situation is dem onstrated in the following diagram: When the stone was in position the monk behind the small drum gave a signal to start the concert. The small dr um had a very sharp sound, and could be heard even with the other instruments making a terrible din. All the monks were singing and chanting a prayer, slowly increasing the tempo of this unbelievable noise. During the first four minutes nothing happened, then as the speed of the drumming, and the noise, increased, the big stone block started to rock and sway, and suddenly it took off into the air with an increasing speed in the direction of the platform in front of the cave hole 250 metres high. After three minutes of ascent it landed on the platform. Continuously they brought new blocks to the meadow, and the monks using this method, transported 5 to 6 blocks per hour on a parabolic flight track approximately 500 metres long and 250 metres high. From time to time a stone split, and the monks moved the split stones away. Quite an unbelievable task. Dr Jarl knew about the hurling of the stones. Tibetan experts like Linaver, Spalding and Hue had spoken about it, but they had never seen it. So Dr Jarl was the first foreigner who had the opportunity to see this remarkable spectacle. Because he had the opinion in the beginning that he was the victim "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 215 of mass-psychosis he made two films of the incident. The films showed exactly the same things that he had witnessed. The English Society for which Dr Jarl was working confiscated the two films and declared them classified. They will not be released until 1990. This action is rather hard to explain, or understand. : End of trans.\" The fact that the films were immediately classified is not very hard to understand once the given measurements ar e transposed into their geometric equivalents. It then becomes evident that the monks in Tibet are fully conversant with the laws governing the structure of matter, which the scientists in the modern day western wo rld are now frantically exploring. It appears, from the calculations, that th e prayers being chanted by the monks did not have any direct bearing on the fact that the stones were levitated from the ground.The reaction was not initiated by the religious fervour of the group, but by the superior scientific knowledge held by the high priests. The secret is in the geometric placement of the musical instruments in relation to the stones to be levitated, and the harmonic tuning of the drums and trumpets. The combined loud chanting of the priests, using their voices at a certain pitch and rhythm most probably adds to the combined effect, but the subject matter of the chant, 1 beli eve, would be of no consequence. The sound waves being generated by the combination were directed in such a way that an anti-gravitational effect was created at the centre of focus (position of the stones) and around the periphery, or the arc, of a third of a circle through which the stones moved. If we analyse the diagram published with the original article, then compare it with the modified diagram, we become aware of the following coordinates, and the implications, when compared with my previously published works. The distance between the stone block and the central pivot of the drum supports is shown as 63 metres. The large drums were said to be one and one half metres long, so the distance from th e block to the rear face of each drum could be close to 63.75 metres consideri ng that the pivot point would be near the centre of balance. My theoretical anal ysis, by calculator, indicates that the exact distance would be 63.7079 metres for the optimum harmonic reaction. By mathematical conversion we find th at this value is equal to 206.2648062 geodetic feet, which is harmonically equal to the length of the earth's radius in seconds of arc (relative to the earth's surface) 206264.8062. This also leads us to the following associations: (206.2648062 x 2) = 412.5296124 This number squared: = 170180.68 which is the theoretical harm onic of mass at the earth's surface. The four rows of monks standing behind the instruments in a quarter circle added to the production of sound by thei r loud chanting and must be taken in to account in regards to the geometric pattern. If we assume that they were standing approximately two feet apart, we can add a calculated value of 8.08865 geodetic feet to the radius of the complete group. This gives a maximum   radius   of:   214.3534583 geodetic feet. "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"216 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID The circumference of a complete circle with this radius would be: 1346.822499 geodetic feet. Which is a half harmonic of: 2693.645 (unified field) The distance from the stone block to a calculated point within the cliff face and the height of the ledge on the cliff face from ground level is given as 250 metres. If we can now imagine that th e raised stone blocks pass through a quarter arc of a circle during their flight from ground level to the hole in the cliff face, then the pivot point of the radius would be coincident with this position. See diagram. The theoretical radius was found to be: 249.8767262 metres which very closel y approximates the estimate. This converts to: 809.016999 geodetic feet. The diameter of the full circle would therefore be: 1618.034 geodetic feet. A circle with this diameter has a circumference of 5083.203728 units, which can be divided into three even lengths of 1694.4. It therefore appears that the levitated blocks, once resonated to a certain frequency, would tend to carry out a flight path that is coincident to one third of a circle. The spacial distance being equivalent to the mass harmonic at the centre of a light field, 1694443. The instruments used by the group, in theory, would also have been tuned to produce harmonic wave forms associated with the unified fields. The given measurements are in rounded off parts of a metre but in practice some slight variations from these measurements woul d be expected in order to create the appropriate resonating cavities with in the instruments. The geometric arrangement, and the number of instruments in the group would also be a most important factor. If the given measurement foreach type of drum is modified fractionally and converted to its geometric equivalent an interesting value for the cubic capacity is evident. The large drums: 1.517201563 metres long, 1.000721361 metres wide = 58.94627524 geodetic inches long, 38.88 geodetic inches wide. = 69984 cubic geodetic inches capacity = 40.5 cubic geodetic feet capacity. Therefore the cubic capacity for eight drums: = 324 cubic geodetic feet. This harmonic value is built into the wo rld grid and is equal to half the harmonic 648. The medium sized drums: 1.000721361 metres long, 0.695189635 metres wide = 38.88 geodetic inches long, 27.00948944 geodetic inches wide = 22276.59899 cubic geodetic inches capacity = 12.89155034 cubic geodetic feet capacity.

As the dish-shape was focussed upwards towards the stone block to be levitated it would be expected that so me type of reaction would take place which had an effect on the mass. The geometric shape of the cavity does seem to be engineered in such a way that the projected frequency vortex causes a reciprocal reaction to the mass harmonic of each block. The reciprocal of: 0.484813682 = 2.062648055 Twice this value: = 4.12529611 The square of t h i s value: = 17.018068 (the harmonic of mass at the earth's surface, 17018068) I believe that there is not much doubt that the Tibetans had possession ol the secrets relating to the geometric st ructure of matter, and the methods of manipulating the harmonic values, but it we can grasp the mathematical theory behind the incident, and extend the application, then an even more fascinating idea presents itself. In my last book I mentioned the flyi ng machines described in ancient records, that flew through the air with a melodious sound, and theorised that the sonic apparatus was tuned to the harmonic unified equations. Now the Tibetans have given us a direct indication of how to construct a sonically propelled anti-gravitational flying machine. All that is necessary is to complete the circle of sonic genera tors, indicated by the drums, trumpets, etc., and we have a disc which creates an anti-gravitational lifting force at the centre, (see diagram 23). To create this diagram 1 made four ph oto-copies of the original illustration showing the arrangement of drums, tr umpets etc. and then cut out the 90 degree segments and fitted them together into a circular pattern. This was then photo-copied a second time in the relationship with a disc-shaped vehicle. When the circular pattern was formed it became evident that the Tibetans had placed the drums and trumpets on the arc of a quarter circle, but the placement of the Priests behind the drums tended to form a spiral. This conforms with the concept of the form ation of matter due to the spiralling, vortexual, wave motions in space, discus sed in my earlier works. Similar wave motions would have to be created in order to manipulate matter. The inner diameter of the sonic generators in the theoretical vehicle would be 412.5296 geodetic feet, with the previously described harmonic associations. The outer diameter, es timated from the placement of the Tibetan priests, would be 428.7069166 ge odetic feet. If we square the inner diameter we have the harmonic of mass 17018068 relative to the earth's surface, and the outer diam eter would give a circ umference tuned to the unified equation. The lift vectors th rough the centre would resonate at "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"218 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID harmonic frequencies in opposition to the mass value at the centre of a unified, or light, field = 1694443. From this it would appear that a vehicle could be constructed that would resonate at frequencies in sympathy with the unified fields demonstrated throughout this work. It is my opinion that our own scientific establishments are far ahead in t h i s type of research, and that many expe rimental vehicles have already been constructed. High frequency generators have probably taken the place of the low frequency sonic methods, and electronic systems produced which would allow complete control of movement. With t h i s type of research going on, I would say that the days of the conventional aeroplane are numbered.

This proposed system is said to be the ultimate system to insure the security of the United States--and the world, at least by those who propose it. Those fighting agains t it maintain that it is not technically feasible. Supporters in the Reagan Admi nistration propose a system that would work like this: when Soviet ICBM missies, loaded with their nuclear payloads, are launched at the U.S., the \"Star Wars\" system, hovering in space, would fire super-high powered Lasers at the missiles wh ile they are still in the air, thereby disabling them. These super-high powered Lasers would be powered by small atomic explosions within the \"Star Wars\" satellites themselves. Critics charge that Laser technology has not advanced enough to enable the United States, or any country, to pull off such a feat. Yet another alternative rarely discussed in the media is available, and it is a technology fifty years old, invented by Nikola Tesla, the electrical genius who lit the world: Scalar Waves! Scalar Waves are a form of ra dio waves creating what is known as Longitudinal Wave Inte rference. Where two Scalar Waves meet, an energy bottle is created which disintegrates all matter within that bottle, produc ing what is in effect a miniature atomic explosion but without any resulting radiation. Thomas Bearden, a retired Pentagon war games expert and active consulting engineer to the Defense Department, has written a number of papers on Scalar Wave systems and often lectures on Scalar Waves at Alternative Energy conferences. According to Bearden, the Soviets are way ahead of the U.S. in Scalar Wave technology and are already using it against the U.S. Scalar Wave technology is appare ntly very real and deadly. Furthermore, it is a great deal more simple to use than Lasers, far more effective, and does not require mini-atomic explosions to power it. Is it possible that Scalar \"Howitzers,\" as Bearden calls them, is the real system that the Pent agon would like to put into space? What applications might such a system have? The Pentagon has insisted so far that their proposed \"Star Wars\" program is entirely defensive, designed to protect the U.S. from a nuclear attack. Incred ibly, Ronald Reagan even said in a press conference once that after the United States had built their \"Star Wars\" system, they wo uld give it to the Russians, who would then build their own sy stem in space, so the world would be theoretically safe fr om nuclear war for ever more! Reagan later said in another news conference that maybe this "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"224 ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID WHERE TWO SCALAR WAVES MEET, AN ENERGY BOTTLE IS CREATED, AND ALL MATTER WITHIN THAT BOTTLE IS DISINTIGRATED. MORE EFFECTIVE THAN LASERS? WHAT IS THE REAL PURPOSE BEHIND STAR WARS? "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"ANTI-GRAVITY AND THE WORLD GRID 225 wasn't such a good idea afterall. When a \"Stars Wars\" system us ing Scalar Wave technology is activated, its uses are in fact mo re \"offensive\" than \"defensive.\" If Scalar Wave weapons are r eal, they are a weapon of such incredible power and versatilit y, then no one on our planet would be safe from them. Given the proper coordinates, the Scalar transmitters located on satellites in space could disintegrate any target on the planet, be it a missile, enemy base, rioting city district, farm house or persons gathering in a park. Such a \"Star Wars\" system would be a literal \"Death Star\" in space! Its uses co uld be population cont rol, extermination, and military domination of an en tire planet. George Lucas may be more of a prophet than he realizes. On the brighter side, Scalar Waves can be warped into a dome around objects, such as cities or houses (publishing companies included). Such a Scalar Wave force field is generally known as a Tesla Shield, and it would be analogous to the \"shields\" referred to in the popul ar \"Star Trek\" series. Tesla Shields have a definite defensiv e application, and could not in any way be used for offensive pu rposes (although a platoon of soldiers charging into a Tesl a Shield would be instantly disintegrated). The only defense from a blast of a Scalar Wave Howitzer would be a Tesla Shie ld. Therefore, those persons wishing to use Scalar Waves on an unsuspecting population would rather that they were unaware of this technology, and thereby unable to protect themselves by use of the same technology. Is this th e reason that the Pent agon does not discuss Scalar Wave technology, but rather maintains that they are going to use impractical Laser technology instead? Scalar Wave Technology is straight out of science-fiction, yet it was invented more than fift y years ago by Nikola Tesla (see the article by Nikola Tesla in The Anti-Gravity Handbook). Another interesting application of Scalar Wave technology is its use in \"Light Sabers.\" If a Scalar Wave emanates from a gripable handle and then is bent back on itself, it would become exactly like a \"Light Saber\" as depicted in the \"Star Wars\" movies featuring Jedi Knights (written and produced by George Lucas). Are Scalar Waves a real tech nology? Do the Soviets have this technology? Assuredly so. The Americans do as well. The secret American base at Pine Gap in Central Austra lia is said to have two Scalar Wave towers in it already. We ur ge readers to read some of the biographies of Nikola Tesla.
