Bearden -- IMPLICATIONS -- Some of the fundamental concepts of the new Tesla electromagnetics are presented. The new concepts have startling implications: (1) No force or force field exists as such in vacuum. (2) Hertzian (transverse) electromagnetic waves do not travel through the vacuum, just as Tesla stated. (3) Forceless, massless Tesla (scalar) longitudinal waves actually transit the vacuum. Tesla called them \"electrical sound waves.\" (4) At present there are actually four different FUNDAMENTAL TYPES of vectorial entities in physics, erroneously confused as one and the same. (5) Tesla longitudinal scalar waves are also \"time\" waves and can affect anything and everything that exists in time. (6) The fundamental constants of nature (which exist in time) can be altered by Tesla scalar waves, which oscillate the values of the constants. (7) Every vector and scalar has an internal substructure, which can be independently affected and changed. This allows the direct engineering of the virtual state and the vacuum itself. (8) All observable forces (electrical, mechanical, gravitational, etc.) arise in, on, and OF the actual substructure of the \"accelerating mass particle\" itself, not as an \"external\" massless force or force field applied \"to\" a mass . (9) Physical reality itself -- and the \"physical laws of nature\" http://www.cheniere.org/books/part3/implications.htm (1 of 5)24.11.2003 21:28:34"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website can be deliberately changed and engineered. (10) All \"physical reality\" is totally internal to the physical changes of the mass particles of the detector system of the observer. (11) Relativity's speed of light limitation applies only to the changes of the basic mass particles of the detecting instrument. (12) Detection of superluminal effects cannot be accomplished by a \"single stage\" or \"single shift \" (single interaction) detector . (13) Detection of superluminal effects is permitted by \"multiple stage\" or \"multiple shift\" interactions where the last interaction is a conventional interaction of photon vs. detector particle. (The two- slit apparatus for detection of electron diffraction is an example. First, the superluminal DeBroglie waves interact with the slits, which are \"tuned\" toward the electron's DeBroglie wavelength. The interaction with TWO slits produces subluminal interference effects, which then interact back upon the physical electron. The apparatus is thus an electron interferometer capable of detecting superluminal waves by a two- stage interaction). (14) Interference is the most common first-stage superluminal interaction to accomplish \"downshifting\" superluminal entities to luminal or subluminal velocities. Superposition of superluminal \"phase\" waves (such as deBroglie waves, which individually always move faster than the speed of light) interferes the waves to create a subluminal group velocity, which may then interact with an ordinary mass particle in the detection system. (15) Any otherwise physical vector must exist as an unzipped (segmented) or \"shadow\" vector in vacuum. \"Radiation\" of a vector EM wave from the electron gas in an antenna into vacuum results in the \"choking off\" of the mass of the transversely oscillating electrons in the antenna. Since the spinning electron mass is the \"zipper\" that makes or comprises the physical vector in the first place, this throttling of the mass flow unzips the E and B vectors, leaving whirling (massless magnetic scalar potential) segments of massless charge flux (massless electrostatic scalar potential). This unzipped whirling pattern of charge flux (scalar massless A/Ø) is what radiates into vacuum and propagates through it. This is a special kind of http://www.cheniere.org/books/part3/implications.htm (2 of 5)24.11.2003 21:28:34"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website scalar wave pattern, not a physical or vector wave. (16) The spin of a charged particle is the mechanism for integrating or \"zipping together\" the individual virtual fragments of a shadow vector into a real (observable) vector. For \"uncharged particles\" such as neutrons, it is the spins of its virtual charged components. that accomplish the integration or zipping. (17) All fundamental charged particles are constantly accelerated. There is no such thing as an \"unaccelerated\" particle, except as a gross average over time or length. Further, all of them are spinning. (18) All changes to and from a physical vector or scalar system must arise in and come from its own internal substructure, which is zipped to its spinning particle of mass. (19) All fundamental particles are charged internally. That is, they are dynamic assemblages of smaller charged particles. If the average sum of the total internal charge is essentially zero over some finite, small increment of time, the particle is externally uncharged. If the sum is not essentially zero, the particle is also externally charged. (20) There are no static physical things in existence. In physical reality, something appears \"static\" only at a particular level. Upon sufficiently fine examination, it is composed of accelerating parts, and thus comprised of \"fluctuations.\" (21) Since (a) the basic physical (mass) vector consists of a \"smeared particle,'' where particle and smear are inseparable, (b) the conceptual particle also is accelerated, and (c) the \"smearing\" is for a small increment of time and a small increment of length; then the basic constituency of \"physical reality\" is inseparable \"force x time x length,\" or action. The basic \"quantum\" of physical change is thus comprised of action. (22) Since to \"detect\" we must \"stop\" the action, separate or split the quantum into two pieces (\"canonical\" pieces) , and compare (measure) one piece by throwing away the other, then each physical observable must have a differential operator (the \"separating agent\") corresponding to it. This accounts for the fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics whereby every observable has a corresponding operator. Further, since what remains is totally relative to what was split out and thrown away, physical change http://www.cheniere.org/books/part3/implications.htm (3 of 5)24.11.2003 21:28:34"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website is totally \"relative.\" This accounts for the fact that observed reality is relative, each part to each other. (23) As a special case, we may assume that we can evaluate a physical change at a point (without length). If so, when we discard length, the remaining basic vector is momentum. This approximation holds only so long as the system to which it is applied essentially does not change over the quantal fragment of length discarded -- i.e., it holds for the linear case. Conservation of momentum, then, is violated when sufficient nonlinearity in length is present. (24) As a second special case, we may assume that we can evaluate a physical change in a spatial manner (without time). If so, when we discard time, the remaining basic vector is energy (has the units of energy or work). This approximation holds only so long as the system to which it is applied essentially does not change over the quantal fragment of time discarded -- i.e., it holds for the linear case. Conservation of energy, then, is violated when sufficient nonlinearity in time is present. Since a \"virtual change\" a priori is defined as a total nonlinearity in the observer's quantal time increment but not outside it, then virtual interactions can and do violate conservation of energy within that time increment, but not out of it -- so long as the time interval itself is considered linear. If the time interval is sufficiently nonlinear, then the virtual change may result in violation of the conservation of energy externally to the time increment. In that case, an \"observable change\" results . (25) As a third special case, we may assume that we can evaluate the \"instantaneous value\" of a physical change at a static point in space. To do so, we must discard both time (to be instantaneous) and length (to be at a spatial point), and the remaining basic vector is force. This approximation holds only so long as the system to which it is applied essentially does not change over the quantal fragment of time or the quantal fragment of length discarded. Conservation of force, then, is violated when sufficient nonlinearity in time or length is present. (26) A new conservation of energy law is required, one which unites the present conservation of energy law with an altered form of the conservation of charge law.

(27) All AL and At fragments are produced and destroyed one at a time, in the action fissioning of a single quantum of action (detection process). Each ∇ L and ∇ t is discretized but not quantized. Since quanta do not superpose, the \"external universe\" is continually created and destroyed in the detector's mass system, one quantum at a time, at a very high rate. This interpretation gives physical meaning to the creation and annihilation operators of quantum mechanics. (28) Since the detecting mass system is itself continually created and destroyed one quantum at a time, ultimately all is mind changes, and only mind changes. The observer's life, mind, and being transcend all materialistic interpretations of reality -- as indeed does the very fact of the \"existence\" of a perceived external universe.

These errors are now so firmly entrenched that they form a part of the \"mindset\" of almost all physicists, engineers, and scientists. So ingrained are these errors and inconsistencies that the orthodox scientist/theoretician finds it almost impossible to break out of them. The present mindset is analogous to the Newtonian mindset which so fiercely resisted the new ideas of relativity, shortly after the turn of the century. However, after a few scientists formulated the rules and theory of the \"relativity mathematics game,\" a new generation of students, not yet so firmly engrained in the Newtonian mindset, could grasp the new relativity when their teachers expounded it. In this short series of papers 1 , 2 I will roughly outline where the founders of mechanics and electromagnetics went wrong, and indicate the way to correct the fundamental errors. In addition, I will briefly point out some of the implications, and speak of some direct experimental proof.

See Bearden, \"A Conditional Criterion for Identity, Leading to a Fourth Law of Logic,\" DTIS report, available through the National Technical Information System, Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 4. Specifically, the resulting theory becomes a curtailed, special case of the much more fundamental electrodynamics and electromagnetics that actually exist . 5. We point out here that measuring a field of force existing in the electron gas in a probe of the measuring instrument is not at all the same thing as measuring a force in the vacuum, nor does it establish that a force exists in vacuum. Indeed, it is already well known that the FIELD concept itself will not withstand rigorous logical examination. For a discussion rather clearly showing the present difficulty in defining a field, see Robert Bruce Lindsay and Henry Margenau, Foundations of Physics, Dover Publications, New York, 1963, pp. 283-287. Note particularly on p. 283 that a \"field of force\" at any point is actually DEFINED only for the case when a unit mass is present at that point. It is then illogically ASSUMED that the force http://www.cheniere.org/books/part3/notes.htm (1 of 9)24.11.2003 21:28:41"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"TOWARD A NEW ELECTROMAGNETICS PART III continues to exist at the point in the ABSENCE of the mass, which of course need not follow at all. On p. 284, note the similar logical paradox connected with the idea of a scalar gravitational potential field. The potential (field) is only defined at a point when mass is present at that point, .and it is specifically defined as the potential energy per unit mass for a particle present at that point. IF THERE IS NO MASS PRESENT, NEITHER A FORCE VECTOR FIELD NOR A SCALAR POTENTIAL FIELD IS DEFINED THERE. ASSIGNMENT OF THESE FIELDS TO THE POINT IN THE ABSENCE OF THE MASS IS AN ASSUMPTION, NOT AT ALL A DEFINITION. SINCE A TRUE DEFINITION IS AN IDENTITY, THEN THE ENTITY IDENTIFIED (DEFINED) TO INCLUDE THE PRESENCE OF MASS IS NOT IDENTICAL TO THE ENTITY RESULTING WHEN THAT MASS IS ABSENTED. To see just how arbitrary and postulational are present. \"definitions\" of mass and force, see Lindsay and Margenau, op. cit., pp. 84-101. Also see Richard P. Feynman, Robert B. Leighton, and Matthew Sands, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Addison-Wesley, New York, Vol.1,. 1963, Fourth Printing July 1966, p.2- 4 for a definition of the electric field in the context of its POTENTIALITY for producing a force. Again, the force only exists when a particle of mass is present. From these examples, one can see the implication that A PHYSICAL FIELD IS SOMETHING SUCH THAT, WHEN A MASS IS INTRODUCED INTO IT, THE MASS EXHIBITS AN EFFECT. For a \"force field,\" this is tantamount to stating that there exists some mechanism connected with a field which, in the presence of a mass causes a force to be exhibited. In that case the force is an EFFECT, not a cause, and there is a more fundamental mechanism that GENERATES FORCE ITSELF. See also field discussions in Feynman, Richard, The Character of Physical Law, M.I.T. Press, Cambridge, MA, March 1967, 2nd printing September 1967, passim. 6. While in Europe prior to 1881, Albert Abraham Michelson performed his first interferometer experiments to determine the velocity of the earth through the ether, obtaining essentially null results. At the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, http://www.cheniere.org/books/part3/notes.htm (2 of 9)24.11.2003 21:28:41"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"TOWARD A NEW ELECTROMAGNETICS PART III Ohio, he perfected his interferometer experiment from 1883 to 1887, assisted by a colleague, chemist Edward Williams Morley. By 1887 the results were ready and announced. Michelson himself thought his experiment had proven Stokes' theory of an ether dragged along by the earth in motion, and thus motionless with respect to the earth. This was at odds, however, with certain other experiments indicating a moving ether. The Michelson-Morley experiment was finally reconciled with these other experiments by Fitzgerald's suggestion in 1892 that the physical dimensions of material bodies are altered when they are in motion. In 1907 Michelson was awarded the Nobel prize, the first American to receive it in the sciences. 7. See Lindsay and Margenau, Foundations of Physics, 1963, pp. 324-326; D. C. Miller, \"The Ether Drift Experiment and the Determination of the Absolute Motion of the Earth,\" Reviews of Modern Physics, Vol. 5, p. 203, 1933. Actually the experiments did not yield a conclusively null result, but rather showed large systematic trends. For a typical elimination of the systematic trends, see Handschy, M.

See Davies, Paul, \"Something for nothing,\" New Scientist, 27 May 1982, pp. 580- 582 for a discussion showing that modern theories of the vacuum reveal that even empty space is seething with activity; an ether of sorts emerges from vacuum fluctuations due to quantum mechanics considerations. See Hooper, William J., \"All-Electric Motional Electric Field Generator,\" U. S. Patent No. 3,610,971, October 5, 1971 for a generator which produces a gravitational or inertial field. Einstein suggested that vacuum, complete with electromagnetic and gravitational fields, be called the ether. Dirac certainly did not abandon an ether, for in 1954 he stated \"The aetherless basis of physical theory may have reached the end of its capabilities and we see in the aether a new hope for the future.\" James Clerk Maxwell derived his famous equations based on an ether theory. Sir Arthur Eddington also believed firmly in an ether. Sir Oliver Lodge actually pointed out the dilemma which yields the approach in this paper: writing of the ether in his book, The Ether of Space, Harper & Bros., New York, 1909, he stated: \"We have no means of getting hold of the ether mechanically; we cannot grip it or move it in the ordinary way: we can only get it electrically. We are straining the ether when we charge a body with electricity; it tries to recover, it has the power of recoil.. . . \"But when electrical theory was being founded, scientists thought of space as something rather fixed, and FILLED WITH a thin material ether. They did not realize that space itself does not exist except after an observation; before the observation, spacetime exists -- indefinite in both length and time. They did not know that electrostatic scalar potential in fact was spacetime, hence also the vacuum and the ether. In assuming that the charge of vacuum is zero and that charge and charged mass are identical, they hid the answer to the dilemma and placed the foundations of electromagnetics on its present unsound basis. 8. The field, of course, is indeed a highly useful concept and this author certainly does not recommend its abandonment. Instead, he recommends that it be placed on a sounder logical basis. 9. Specifically, they came to feel that the \"electric http://www.cheniere.org/books/part3/notes.htm (4 of 9)24.11.2003 21:28:41"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"TOWARD A NEW ELECTROMAGNETICS PART III field\" which was improperly defined -- was what was waving. 10. In fact Einstein once proposed that the vacuum, complete with its electromagnetic and gravitational fields, should be called the ether. His proposal was not adopted. (See Born, Max, Einstein's Theory of Relativity, Revised Edition, Dover Publications, New York, 1965, p. 224. ) 11. Particularly from the work of Schrodinger, Born, Dirac and others. 12. For example, see Lindsay and Marge. nau, op. cit., pp. 287-288. A physical vector is thought to be defined by its magnitude, its direction in space, and its transformation characteristics. Actually that is a geometrical vector, not a physical vector. It does not tell us WHAT A VECTOR CONSISTS OF, but only tells us some of its important characteristics. Remember that a true definition must be an identity. 13. Here a reading of Lindsay and Margenau, op. cit., pp. 79-81 may prove enlightening. Also note that velocity, or L/T considered \"at an instant\" (stopped), represents an idea of \"motionless motion\" and is an application of the fourth law of logic. For a discussion of the fourth law of logic and its usage, see Bearden, Thomas E., \"A Conditional Criterion for Identity, Leading to a Fourth Law of Logic,\" Specula, Journal of the A.A.M.S., P.O. Box 1182, Huntsville, AL 35807, combined Vol. 3, No. 4/Vol. 4, No. 3, Oct 1980 - Mar 1981, pp. 50-57 (also available from Defense Technical Information Service). 14. Note this is an identity of opposites, which explicitly violates the three Aristotlean laws of logic. See Bearden, \"A Conditional Criterion for Identity, Leading to a Fourth Law of Logic,\" loc. cit., 1981. 15. Again note the fourth law of logic: zero motion (the absence of motion) being recognized as a special case of the presence of motion. Also, physical reality consists of internested levels, and any physical object has an internal substructure of nested levels of finer structure, extending down into the virtual (nonobserved) state. For a vector to model (apply to) a http://www.cheniere.org/books/part3/notes.htm (5 of 9)24.11.2003 21:28:41"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"TOWARD A NEW ELECTROMAGNETICS PART III physical object, it itself must be modeled in such fashion as to reflect this kind of substructure. Thus the use of geometrical vectors as models of physical objects in motion is presently flawed in a fundamental fashion. 16. The reader is most strongly urged to read Morris Kline, Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty, Oxford University Press, New York, 1980 as a prelude to understanding what mathematics is and is not, and what it does and does not. 17. Refer to Lindsay & Margenau, op. cit., pp. 79-81 to see how the ideas of motion and vector are inextricably entangled with the idea of a particle. 18. Call it uncertainty or call it constituency; a quantum change is composed of two canonical entities inextricably welded together into a single entity. 19. Time is an unavoidable, nonexclusive constituency of the welded quantum. 20. Simply from the definition of force as CONSISTING OF a time- and length-smeared mass motion change. 21. The force is an effect, not a cause. It IS the smeared charged particle. It is CAUSED by a more fundamental mechanism. It is the result of the combination of (1) a nonzero del phi, and (2) the presence of a spinning charged particle. IN A DEL PHI, THE SPINNING CHARGED PARTICLE ACCELERATES ITSELF! This is the fundamental secret of free energy that was suppressed, to bury the fundamental work of Nikola Tesla, shortly after Tesla was forced to abort his Wardenclyffe attempt to provide the world with free energy. 22.

De Beauregard, O. Costa, \"Running backwards the Mermin device: Causality in EPR correlations,\" American Journal of Physics, Vol. 51, No. 6, June 1983, p. 515. 24. Note the Soviet scientist Kozyrev's experiments with time waves. See Kozyrev, N. A., \"Possibility of Experimental Study of the Properties of Time,\" September 1967, pp. 1-49, in JPRS 45238, May 1968. Kozyrev reports real physical effects from the oscillation of time. Also, note that scalar potential energy of appreciable size with respect to a particle's rest energy can force the situation to be relativistic, even though the velocity of the particle with respect to the velocity of light is small. That is, electrostatic scalar potential alone can cause variation in the rate of flow of time and hence vary physical characteristics. See Bloch & Crater, \"Lorentz-invariant potentials and the non-relativistic limit,\" American Journal of Physics, Vol. 49, No.1, 1981, pp. 67-75. By inference, oscillating the electrostatic scalar potential can produce time waves and lead to direct physical effects. 25. It is already shown in the literature that the electrostatic scalar potential (ESP) can affect spacetime (ST) in the same manner as velocity. Cf Bloch & Crater, op. cit., 1981. Now note that, to any quantal or macroscopic observer, the existence of the 4-space volume of ST implicit in ( ∆ t)( ∆ v), where v is volume, cannot be separated from the existence of the subquantal entities that exist therein. We therefore DEFINE the magnitude of the ESP as the summation of the absolute values of all the internal virtual vectors in the ( ∆ t)( ∆ v) quantum of ST, divided by the absolute value (magnitude) of ( ∆ t)( ∆ v). We take the view that no such thing as \"unstressed\" ST physically exists, and that \"spacetime\" and \"stressed spacetime\" are identical. Hence ESP and ST are one and the same thing. Note that this implies that the virtual density of ST is variable, and is nothing but the magnitude of the ESP. In EM theory, the assumption that the ESP of vacuum (Ø O ) is equal to zero is in serious error. In fact, Ø O IS \"spacetime of the laboratory observer,\" in the new view. 26. For example, the definition of the electrostatic http://www.cheniere.org/books/part3/notes.htm (7 of 9)24.11.2003 21:28:41"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"TOWARD A NEW ELECTROMAGNETICS PART III potential (ESP) is usually taken as \"the work which must be done against electric forces to bring a unit charge from a reference point to the point in question; the reference point is located at an infinite distance, or, for practical purposes, at the surface of the earth or some other large conductor.\" (McGraw-Hill Dictionary of. Scientific and Technical Terms, ed. Daniel N. Lapedes, second edition, 1978, p. 518.) Note that this is NOT a definition at all, for it is not an identity. Instead, it is the statement that, if an ESP exists at a point and a unit charged mass (assumed to be at a point) is brought in from infinity toward the ESP location point, the amount of work it is necessary to expend upon the mass of the particle is equal to the magnitude of the ESP. The ESP exists whether or not any work at all is expended, and whether or not a charged unit mass is brought in. To adequately define ESP, we must define its identity, or what it consists of, in the absence of mass, since we have conceived the ESP to exist at a vacuum point. Further, the definition usually taken is completely a 3-space definition. Instead, in our new view the ESP is to be taken at a point in n-space, where n is equal to or greater than 4. 27.

Briefly, by a \"particle\" we mean an entity so constructed that, if any part of it changes all of it changes. From the viewpoint of the particle, this implies that to change is to detect, and to detect is to change. Also, internal and external become synonymous, in the \"detected\" sense. The idea of a \"fundamental particle\" in physics actually invokes the fourth law of logic implicitly. 35. Only if a thing dimensionally contains time, can it \"occupy time.\" This point is so obvious that one wonders how so many of the scientists and mathematicians seem to have missed it. By this criterion, e.g., mass does not exist in time, a priori. To \"observe\" or detect, in fact, means to stop time, thus collapsing the wave function. However, it reduces the observable or detectable to a spatial quantity, not a spatiotemporal quantity. In other words, the ordinary scientific method destroys a part of reality in each detection or measurement, yielding only a partial truth. not fundamental truth. 36.

So we ask, \"What precisely is geometry?\" Here we are not interested in a \"textbook\" answer, but in an answer indicating what geometry really does. 3 In other words, with what does geometry concern itself, and what is the fundamental nature of those things with which it concerns itself? Briefly, geometry -- at its foundation -- is totally spatial. It is fitted to, and expressed in terms of, the TOTAL ABSENCE OF MASS. Thus the geometer deals in abstract, massless entities called \"points,\" \"lines,\" \"planes\" etc. When the geometer speaks of \"motion,\" he speaks of a time-smeared, length-smeared point. Geometry at heart is massless, and a \"geometer's vector\" is a highly specific type of \"system.\" In fact, it represents the \"time-smearing\" and \"length-smearing\" of a point. A priori, the fundamental concept of the geometrical vector has taken a \"spatial\" entity and introduced a hidden involvement with \"time.\" Modern mathematics and physics have followed an intertwined development for several hundred years. And both sprang as offshoots of the original work of the geometers. Let us briefly sketch the overall path of interest taken by these two developing disciplines. With the advent of Descartes's fundamental work, algebra was combined with geometry to yield analytic geometry, a new and powerful mathematical tool. With the invention of calculus by Leibniz and Newton, both mathematics and physics received a giant impetus. Differential geometry and vector mathematics arose in full splendor and, in physics, mechanics leaped to the forefront with Newton's http://www.cheniere.org/books/part3/geometry.htm (1 of 3)24.11.2003 21:28:47"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"TOWARD A NEW ELECTROMAGNETICS PART III profound work. But the mechanics made a most fundamental error when they simply applied the geometer's vector to a mass, to produce -- so they thought -- a mass vector. That which rigorously applies only to the absence of mass cannot be so lightly applied to the presence of mass without the risk of serious limitations in the resulting theory. The precise difference between a geometer's massless vector and a mechanic's mass- vector is one of the issues to be developed in this thesis. As rapid development continued in mechanics and mathematics, certain physicists were involved in intense experimental work on charged matter, becoming the first electricians. Both the preceding mathematical ideas and constructs as well as the preceding (partially erroneous) mechanics constructs and ideas were applied by the electricians, struggling with their pith balls, cat fur, and glass rods to understand, quantify, and model electrical forces and the phenomena of charged matter. In other words, the electricians strove to formulate the physics and dynamics of charged matter and its interactions by simply \"adding to\" the work of the geometers and mechanics. Here again, a fundamental logical error was made. That (geometry) which a priori applies only to the absence of mass, and that (mechanics) which a priori applies only to the absence of charge, cannot be lightly applied to the presence of charged mass (both mass and charge) 4 without risking the incorporation of grave limitations in the resulting theory. After the profound work of Maxwell, the idea of FIELDS OF FORCE became more prominent, until the field concept ruled the day 5 . The electricians continued, pushing the idea of fields into space and vacuum itself, along the way inventing the idea of \"charge effects\" existing even in the massless vacuum, with concomitant fields. Meanwhile, they had thoroughly confused chargeless point-smeared, chargeless mass-smeared, length-smeared and time- smeared vectors. After a set of fundamental experiments designed to detect motion of the material ether yielded essentially null results 6 , Michelson and Morley were regarded as having completely disposed of the ether -- even though the experiments only disposed of material http://www.cheniere.org/books/part3/geometry.htm (2 of 3)24.11.2003 21:28:47"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"TOWARD A NEW ELECTROMAGNETICS PART III ethers, and not Lorentz-invariant non-material ethers 7 . Maxwell's equations and the field concept were elevated to profound importance. 8 Then, after Einstein's fundamental relativity work shortly after the turn of the century, the ether concept faded away and the field concept reigned supreme. Indeed, in their enthusiasm the interpreters of relativity went so far as to affirm that one can have a wave without any medium; that is. that something can be moving (waving) without anything there to move! 9 And with great glee they pronounced the final end to the idea of \"ether\" as a medium, even though Einstein himself never did any such thing. 10 With the advent of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, even matter came to be regarded as just a special \"kink\" or curvature in spacetime or \"vacuum nothing.\" Quantum mechanics arose and even certainty and determination fell. Chaos, probability, and randomness now assumed the ruling position. Probability waves (and probability fields) arose, 11 as did quantum fields of various kinds. The intermingling of these concepts with the concepts of electrodynamics pushed the idea of the field even farther into esoteric realms. The point is, each of these developing disciplines incorporated and built on the foregoing disciplines. From the beginning of geometry, there was no rigorous definition of a vector, and there is none today. 12 From the beginning of mechanics, in their foundations the theorists made grave logical errors by incorporating the geometer's vector; errors so great that today mechanics and electromagnetics are severely flawed, as is everything that came after them and built upon their illogical foundations.

One basic error involves the idea of motion itself. 13 In formulating concepts of motion, the geometers used a \"point in motion\" to determine or specify, for example, velocity. Now a \"point\" is a static concept a priori. To determine (or even to think and perceive) motion, one must determine that it occupies two different points (positions or locations) at two different times, yet consider both points at the same time. Indeed, that is precisely what the arrow means that is used to represent a vector. A \"point in motion\" therefore represents a contradiction of opposites. That is, it represents the idea that \"that which is motionless has motion.\". 14 Even with this, there is a difference in a spatial point and a spatiotemporal (spacetime) point. To exist at all, a spatial point must be moving in time; in other words, it is a spatiotemporal line, even if it is a static spatial point. Vector analysis was constructed in the abstract -- again, a massless point in motion possessed or constituted a velocity vector, etc. In massless ( and timeless) space, FIELDS were defined: \"scalar\" fields constituted the assignment of a simple motionless number (magnitude) to each spatial point, while \"vector\" fields constituted the assignment of a \"simple vector\" (magnitude and velocity) to each spatial point. But the MATHEMATICAL vector system consisted of massless (point) motional relationships, recognizing zero motion as a special case of motion. 15 Of course mathematics development was also always intertwined with practical problems.

These developments required decades and even centuries to occur completely. All along the way, innovations and changes -- and additions to the mathematical formulism were being derived and taught to students as the \"natural\" system of reality. A permanent mindset was being forged. Indeed, mathematics was regarded as THE single human expression of fundamental truth. Not until Godel's work in the twentieth century did it become evident that MATHEMATICS IS SIMPLY A GAME PLAYED ACCORDING TO ASSIGNED RULES, AND THERE IS NO ULTIMATE TRUTH IN MATHEMATICS ALONE. 16 It is a most useful game, of course, since it is the game fitted to perception. Thus it applies, essentially, to whatever can be perceived. But to be applied to physical systems, it must be changed, altered, updated, and fitted as the perceiving/detecting instruments become ever more subtle.

Specifically, the mathematicians and scientists failed to recognize the differences in the four types of vectors, hopelessly intermingling them and confusing them as a single class of vector. Further, they did not appreciate that a fundamental vector conceptually is a UNITARY SYSTEM, and the system represented by one of these four types of vectors utilizes and is comprised of different components, \"welded together with no seam in the middle.\" Conceptually (and from a systems viewpoint), the four types of vectors are (1) the chargeless, massless spatial system vector (geometer's vector), (2) the uncharged mass system vector (mechanic's vector), (3) the charged mass system vector (electrician's vector), and (4) the charged space system vector (advanced electrician's vector). These four fundamentally different vectors are shown in Figures 1, 2, 4, and 9 in a simplified manner. The major problem was that, beginning with the geometer's vector, these four major types of vectors were not treated as systems. Instead, their \"vector\" aspects were hopelessly confused and intermeshed, and no distinctions were made between them. And in the foundations of the mathematical constructs, time- smearing was not recognized at all.

From particle physics and quantum mechanics, we now understand that physical reality is structured of an observable state, underlaid with an infinite number of ever finer, successive levels of virtual (unobservable) states. At least reality is most accurately modeled in that fashion, according to particle physics today. It is also well known, for example, that at the most fundamental level, one cannot actually separate nonmotion from motion (which implies, for example, that one cannot separate mass and velocity). In other words, a \"mass in motion\" idea is actually incorrect, at the most basic level. What actually exists is a sort of \"smeared mass\". That is, \"mass-motion\" is fundamentally what exists, not mass IN motion . Actually, all that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle implies is this fact: If one examines the concept of \"static (non-smeared) thing in non-static (smeared) motion\", in ever finer detail, one reaches a degree of fineness where the \"smearing\" is paramount and one cannot have an un-smeared or \"separate static thing\" to be in motion. Instead, one only has the smeared, 4-dimensional spacetime entity, without 3- dimensional spatial separations. This means, for example, that at the most basic level, it is actually incorrect to represent a momentum with a little static particle of mass connected to a spatial velocity vector. It is incorrect to think of the system as comprised of TWO SEPARATE ENTITIES, (1) a mass, and (2) a massless spatial system velocity vector (a geometer's vector).

First, the particle has spin, which involves rotation, which means that every \"part\" of the periphery of the particle is accelerated toward the center axis of spin. Second, every particle is continuously \"fluctuating,\" and these fluctuations are accelerations. Further, we must consider any change such as an acceleration -- as existing in a small time increment, and occurring in a small length increment. Thus mass particles actually exist as (mass x acceleration x time x length). This of course has the dimensions of ACTION or angular momentum. The \"real\" world of physical matter, then, is composed of building blocks of action, called \"quanta.\" Any other physical \"quantity\" must be obtained by fissioning (differentiating) the action quantum. For this reason, quantum mechanics presently must postulate that to every observable there corresponds an operator.

These vectors are \"built\" starting with four major kinds of particles. 17 These are: (1) the spatial point, (2) an uncharged mass particle, (3) a charged mass particle, and (4) a charged spatial point. Further, each of the four vectors at its most fundamental level (that is, at the quantum level) 18 is actually an inseparable, unitary SYSTEM welded into a single undivided entity containing time and existing nonexclusively in time. 19 When we look at or represent the so-called \"parts\" of the system, we are looking at them before they are welded together into the physical vector. That is, whenever we speak of \"parts, \" we imply that a \"cutting\" or \"differentiating\" action has been implied to separate the system into such \"parts.\" From such considerations, four different kinds of system vectors result.

The vector is the SYSTEM EXISTING IN TIME . To illustrate: \"Momentum\" is more properly referred to as \"mass-motion\" rather than \"mass in motion.\" That is, at the fundamental level, the mass is NOT \"separate\" from its motion. It is NOT separated from the time in which the smearing occurs. The idea of momentum, however, is really to express the time-density of the mass-smeared-through-length. It is, in other words, the time rate of length-smearing of mass.

Our present manner of considering force as a geometer's vector \"separately applied to\" a mass particle is completely erroneous at the quantum level.

IF THERE IS NO OBSERVABLE ACCELERATING MASS PRESENT, THEN THERE CAN BE NO OBSERVABLE FORCE PRESENT. The mass can accelerate in time (increase or decrease of mass) or space (increase or decrease of velocity) or both. Observable force CANNOT exist in vacuum (in the absence of mass), a priori. 20 However, assume for a moment that one could have a massless force vector, as assumed in present electrical theory. Let this force vector appear at a point in the vacuum. Since the vacuum has zero observable mass, it would have zero inertial resistance to this hypothetical observable force -- hence the observable force would instantly produce an \"infinite\" acceleration of its point of application, vanishing with it into the infinite distance.

Thus immediately we have discovered something unique about so-called \"force-fields\" in vacuum: for example, about gravitational field, electrical field, and magnetic field (and the strong force and the weak force as well). These fields do not exist at all as ordinary force vectors -- and real force fields -- in vacuum! and fields, e.g., are defined in terms of force per unit electrical charged mass and magnetically charged mass, respectively. In the absence of mass, they cannot exist. And this in turn means that transverse field waves (Hertzian waves) cannot exist in a vacuum. Indeed, they appear on, and ARE CONSTITUTED of, the charged-mass-motion that changes, and they appear where such change occurs, as a result of an introduced mass. 21 But in the absence of the spinning charged particle of mass, they do not exist as force fields at all. Hertzian waves exist in a transmitting whip antenna, for example, in the oscillating electron gas along its length. Something else entirely different exists in vacuum between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna. Then in the receiving antenna, Hertzian waves again exist in the oscillating electron gas along its length.

That is, it represents the magnitude of the internal stress of a vector system, with the absence of a single observable directionality of the system.

The time derivative is indicative of the stress on the flow of macroscopic time at a fixed spatial point, and the spatial derivative is indicative of the stress on space. Here one is confronted with the fact that what we call \"space\" and \"time\" are continually being created, directly in the physical observing/detecting apparatus itself. 27 That is, rigorously, \"detected physical reality\" exists totally in and of the mass-changes of the observer's mass or his detecting instruments. In the fundamental detection process itself, there is a flow of the rate of creation of spatial lengths and a flow of the rate of creation of time lengths. Indeed, to a linear observer the stress on the creation of the flow of time controls the flow of the creation of space, and the stress on the creation of the flow of space controls the flow of the creation of time. The change in the stress on 4-space (ordinary Minkowskian space-time) controls the \"curvature of that spacetime\" in the fifth dimension.

Thus, generally, (34) That is, in general any observable scalar has, consists of, and is comprised of a VIRTUAL (unobservable) substructure that is very real indeed. One must also consider the scalar as existing for some finite time ∆ t, (at least for the time of one quantum change), and the intensity of the virtual actions occurring in the spatiotemporal substructure of the scalar during that time ∆ t is proportional to the magnitude of the scalar. Normally, the concept of a scalar -- as presently used -- makes no allowance for the scalar to exist in time, or for a virtual vector substructure, or for any patterning inside the substructure. This is equivalent to assuming that A ≡ 0 (35) and that all 's are evenly distributed. That is, from this new viewpoint, presently the mathematical theory assumes all scalars to have an equal density of virtual activity per spatiotemporal volume in its virtual substructure, and an isotropic virtual pattern distribution of an infinite number of equal virtual vectors in its 4- space substructure. 28 In the new approach, neither of these two assumptions need hold -- though in special cases they can hold.

Note that ∆ v->o (39) indicates a delta due to virtual substructure interactions yielding an extra observable delta.

And note that, similar to the scalar case, from the new viewpoint the present theory assumes each scalar (point) of the vector to have a structure similar to that of equation (34), except that now the scalars are ordered, with a linearly decreasing internal stress density per unit scalar along the line of the vector. http://www.cheniere.org/books/part3/scalars%20and.htm (3 of 4)24.11.2003 21:30:08"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"TOWARD A NEW ELECTROMAGNETICS PART III In the new approach, vector interaction (superposition, for example) can now violate present theory, if the two virtual substructures interact nonlinearly to produce a nonzero, observable delta.
