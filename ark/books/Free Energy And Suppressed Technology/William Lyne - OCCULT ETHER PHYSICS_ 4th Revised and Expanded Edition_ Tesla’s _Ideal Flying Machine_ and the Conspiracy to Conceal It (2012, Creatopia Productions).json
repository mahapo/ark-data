The government concealsthis invention behind false scientific theories, “space alien” hoaxes, and falsepropaganda, disseminated through a controlled mass media. A “UFOlogy”,“new-age”, “paranormalist”, and “pseudo-debunker” network is covertly maintainedunder “national security laws”, to blur the facts of reality and disjointinquiry, thus protecting the archaic technology and resources ofcoercive-monopolist, corporate-state interests from the competition of a trulyfree market.Chapter VI is the Lyne Atomic Hydrogen Furnace, a 1964 freeenergy invention ofthe author.TABLE OF CONTENTSPreface........................................................................................................7[text00000.html#link0]Introduction: Nikola Tesla’s Original 1875Plan..........................................11 [text00000.html#link1]The RealCoverup..............................................................................18[text00000.html#link2]Chapter 1: The Occult Ether Theory andElectro-propulsion.......................20Characteristics of Basic EtherParticles.................................................21[text00000.html#link3]The Cause of the “Inverse Square” Law of Gravity?.............................27“Tubes ofForce”.................................................................................28[text00000.html#link4]More on Tesla’s “Primary SolarRays”.................................................29 [text00000.html#link5]An Old Wooden Box and a German Inertial Guidance System.............30[text00000.html#link6]Low and High Frequency Electrostatic Impulses and Tesla’s Wireless Transmissionof Energy..........................................................40[text00000.html#link7]Tesla’s TELEFORCEDiscoveries.........................................................44[text00000.html#link8]Chapter II: Exploring the Nature of theEther.............................................50 [text00000.html#link9]The EarlyBackground..........................................................................50[text00000.html#link10]J.

After all, a man is entitled to a reward for his work.This revision was made necessary in order to get closer to the basic details inregard to Tesla's space propulsion technology. To this end, subtle changes wererequired. The previous 3rd revised edition has already experienced suppressionwhich could only have come from the government through its catspaws. Thisrevision therefore is to push the envelope even further than before.There is much consternation today about the words “cult” and “occult”, and whatthey mean. Many are worried that their own organizations, groups, or religionsmay fall into this category. Since the word “occult” merely refers to “secret”or “hidden”, it is used by doctors to describe unknown bacteria as being“occult”. As for a religion, philosophy, organization or other group activity,it is a “cult” if it utilizes “secret teachings”, made known only to a selectfew initiates or “priests”. Therefore, “national security secrets” are occultand hence the name for this book.Is it possible that an entire area of physics has been declared virtually“occult” and “off-limits” to the public or to private individuals, by a powerfuldeep-black operations group, so that all science education or data generallyavailable to the public has been “screened” to eliminate references to it? Is itpossible that the actual science involved in “electro-propulsion” has beenreplaced with “bogus science”, which has been promoted and promulgated to theextent that no one except the ‘esoteric elite’ knows the truth? And if so, hasthe “occult” science become the exclusive province of a very few speciallyselected corporate/government “scientific priests”?I began studying this controversy—including the science involved —when I was buta child of eight years, in 1946, after interviewing oil field pumpers who hadseen silvery “flying disks” in the remote oil fields in the West Texas andsouthern New Mexico desert. At the age of 13, I spent a couple of days visitingwith family friends and their neighbor, astrophysicist Dr. Lincoln La Paz, inAlbuquerque, new Mexico. La Paz was then employed by the U.S. government to helpcover up Nazi flying saucer technology brought to New Mexico after WW II. Myearly convictions were later corroborated when I acquired a piece of hardwarefrom a 1943 German flying saucer at Sandia Base where La Paz worked.Since the truth about Tesla’s space propulsion system is based on “ether”(A.K.A. “aether”) physics, which has been collected, hidden away, or declared“national security secrets”, or intentionally obliterated by false propagandawhich is so intense that the general public remains unaware of the facts whichare right under their noses, I have dubbed the ether physics ultimatelyconnected to Tesla’s system “Occult Ether Physics”. This book is dedicated tothe rediscovery of, examination of, and the integration of these secrets intothe public knowledge.The high priests of this occult knowledge are the elite owners of the coercivemonopolist corporate banking, industrial, mineral and related interests, who inturn allow the initiation of certain scientists, military and governmentofficials into their secret teachings only insofar as it is necessary, toexecute and maintain a conspiracy of giant proportions, so that the technologycan be classified as a “state secret” which can be controlled and enforced bymeans of unconstitutional “national security laws”, military and civilian legalauthority, and police. These measures are intended to protect the archaictechnology and resources controlled by the elite, from the competition of atruly free market society. This technology is possessed by all the world’s majorgovernments, so we know that they aren’t hiding it from each other, they arehiding it from us, the people.Because of the last 76 or more years of progressively intensifying falsepropaganda and manipulation of knowledge and science, a majority of scientistsridicule the concepts of the existence of an ether and of flying saucers, as ifsuch thinking belonged in the category of a “flat earth” theory and the “littlegreen men” from outer space babble, but the reverse is true. The proponents ofRelativism and the Big Bang want you to believe that the universe is finite, sothat, if you go “too far” you will “fall off the universe”, rather than off a“flat earth”. What’s the difference,? Flat earth...finite universe...they’reboth dumb theories.And what do the “little green men” lies—originally told in 1947 by thegovernment at Roswell—have to do with exclusively manmade electric flyingmachines, and technology based on sound and well-established electrical scienceand physics, but which, like the existence of the ether, has been tucked away insecret vaults, to keep you from using it, while you are being fed false anduseless “theories”? These range from “curved space”, “time travel”, Big Bang”,and “alien abduction” stories, to parallel universe”, “interdimensional travel”,“worm-holes in space”, and any other outrageously incredible stories, concoctedby government spooks, national security personnel, and secret agents in the“UFOlogy” and “pseudo-de-bunker” communities (“pseudo-de-bunkers” in myvernacular are official government spokesmen or scientific know-italls whose jobit is to completely deny the existence of flying saucers, or to ridicule theirother covert government counterparts, the UFOlogists, new-agers, orparanormalists).Before you decide there is no ether, or no flying saucers, or before you believethe often-told “prime time” lies that aliens are “here”, or that time travel ispossible, you should ask yourself whether or not your thinking on these subjectshas been conditioned by Big Brother’s Biggest Lies. If you believe inrelativism, I should point out that “time travel” is an integral part of that,which is a very incredible impossibility which makes the so-called “science” yourely on a worthless piece of pseudo-intellectual crap promoted by someone whowanted to sabotage your mind on behalf of the self-appointed high priests of“Occult Ether Physics”.Is your thinking a barometer of thought-control mediocrity? Are you so out ofcontrol of your own metaphysical concepts and epistemology, that you have to getyour thinking from the “canned goods” section of NASA (NAZIA), courtesy of theCIA’s Office of Scientific Intelligence (“OSI”)? Is your education a frozen “TVdinner”, prepared by a Secret Government, so you’ll never discover the real foodfor thought?For those of you who may be unfamiliar with my more complete exposition of thewhys, wherefores, whos and other facts concerning the huge volume of falsepropaganda designed and disseminated on behalf of the coercive monopolistcorporate state, to conceal flying saucer propulsion and other advanced and“free energy” technology, you should read my other books-- Pentagon Aliens(copyright 1993, 1995, 1999 (3rd Edition), ISBN 0-9637467-7-4, and OccultScience Dictatorship (copyright 2001, ISBN 0-9637467-8-2.The flying saucer is a product of Nikola Tesla’s life work, his mostfundamentally important invention, for which he said all his other inventionswere in pursuit of, though you have probably never heard this fact from anyoneelse. How do I know? I have documented it in many years of research, tracingTesla’s developments and his own words uttered and published during hislifetime, in scattered, sparse yet sufficient sources, as he placed a crowningachievement on top the work of the world’s greatest scientific minds of thenineteenth century, who were Tesla’s inspirations. And this invention has beenconcealed above all others by governments throughout the world. But they couldnot conceal everything, as there were already bits and pieces of informationwhich were already widely published before they got their concealment acttogether.It was supposedly proved, on May 29, 1919, “...that we live in a curvedfour-dimensional space-time”. Albert Einstein said a massive body spinning inspace “...would drag space and time around with it...”, the origin of so-called“frame-dragging” and “space curvature”. “Gravity is no longer a mysterious forceacting at a distance but the result of an object trying to travel in a straightline through space curved by the presence of material bodies”. (Gary Taubes,Relativists in Orbit , Discover, March, 1997).Even such theories...relativistic bromides interlaced with such phrases as “the“fabric of space-time”, “space curvature”, and “frame-dragging”, althoughoff-the-wall ludicrous, suggest the existence of an ether, albeit an erroneousconcept of the ether.Since 1919, Nikola Tesla’s propulsive discoveries have been concealed bygovernment suppression, theft, and ridicule, while theoretical physics hasbecome a pseudo-scientific mathematical shell-game which bears little new fruit,and less resemblance to reality. And this highly dubious “pop” physics isprimarily what is spread by the media, while practicing physicists don't havemuch time for it. It is time for the truth as far as I am able to determine it.INTRODUCTION: NIKOLA TESLA’S ORIGINAL 1875 PLANTesla’s original vision, in his 1870s student days, of his “ideal flyingmachine”, the realization of which is why he said he entered the field ofmechanical engineering in 1875 in the first place; this was the problem which hehad assigned to himself as his main lifelong work. (Frank Parker Stockbridge,The Tesla Turbine, The World’s Work, March, 1912, pp. 543-48). The ship actuallyworks on mechanical principles, but is actuated by electrostatic impulses. Moreon this later.Originally anticipating that the electrical power needs for anelectrostatically-actuated mechanical craft would be too great for an on-boardpower plant (since his ship was to be devoid of sustaining planes), he initiallyembarked on developing his “wireless transmission of power” system, so as totransmit the power needed from ground-based power generators and stations. The“power” being transmitted was actually mechanical in nature. Some of theseearlier Tesla ideas turned out to be unnecessary for his flying machine, so heturned them for appropriate commercial purposes. Since his concept of the etherwas of a relatively low-density one, and his earlier conception of the necessaryforce was not nearly so much stronger than the gravitational one as it laterturned out to be, his later discovery that his anticipated electrical powerneeds were so much greater than that actually required, led to changes in hiscraft, and produced plenty of surplus “spin-off” technologies.As stated in the Preface, in 1914, at a time when he was in great need of money,Tesla unsuccessfully attempted to interest the U.S. government in submarine andpropulsion technology. In an article prepared by Tesla but never published,Tesla said “...we should push the development of flying machines and wirelesstransmission of energy without an instant’s delay and with all the power andresources of the nation”. The immediate association here is between “flyingmachines” (not “aeroplanes”) and “wireless transmission of energy”. Tesla hadpiles of patents which produced him no money, because the Morgans andRockefellers had declared them off limits. No one could borrow money from thebanks to put one of these systems into practice, and anyone who was foolishenough to do so on their own money could expect the wrath of the gods to comedown on them like lightening bolts from Zeus.In 1914 Tesla sold his technology to the German Minister of High Marine, AdmiralAlfred von Tirpitz. Tesla had also failed to interest anyone in the developmentof his wireless energy transmission system. He made the imminent discovery thathis onboard power needs would not be so great, saying “...weight is no object”.In 1913 Tesla had obtained a patent on a remarkable turbine he had inventedabout 1909, which solved his on-board power needs for his flying machine. Thiswas probably in view of encouraging developments and awareness which showed thatthe electromagnetic interaction is 1040 times stronger than the gravitationalinteraction (George Gamow, Gravity, Anchor Books, N.Y. [1962], p. 138) Accordingto Hendrick Lorenz, the electrical attractive force is 2x 1039 times strongerthan the gravitational attractive force.In an interview for a 1912 book, A Boy’s Book of New Inventions - The TeslaTurbine, Tesla further revealed some details of his system when he stated thefollowing: “As I told you before when we were talking of the wirelesstransmission of power, the mechanism will be a development of the principle onwhich my turbine is constructed. It will be so tremendously powerful that itwill make a veritable rope of air above the great machine to hold it at anyaltitude the navigators may choose, and also a rope of air in front or in therear to send it forward or backward at almost any speed desired. When that daycomes, airship travel will be as safe and prosaic as travel by railroad traintoday, and not much very different, except that there will be no dirt, and itwill be much faster. One will be able to dine in New York, retire in an aeroPullman berth in a closed and perfectly furnished car, and arise to breakfast inLondon.”It was also implied that in producing the “ropes” the Tesla coil was used toproduce rapidly-varying electrostatic potentials to create longitudinal soundwaves in the ether for hundreds of miles through the air. The “equal andopposite reaction” to these waves was to bring back to the ship what are called“tubes of force” which carry mechanical momentum and, what Tesla’s descriptionappears to say, to lock onto a huge mass of ether molecules to pull the shipforward. As I witnessed on the ship I saw in 1953, an electrostatic envelopesurrounded the ship as it moved without air friction, shock wave or sonic boomat around 36,000 mph. The description in the above quote by Tesla also soundslike a “tractor beam” technology. The principle of Tesla’s turbine was to usethe adhesiveness and viscosity of rapidly moving gases to propel his turbineblades around. Applying this same principle to his aircraft would use theadhesiveness and viscosity of the ether applied through a steady brushdischarge, to impart momentum to pull his ship through space.There was a change in Tesla’s strategy which seems to have occurred between this1912 and 1915 tests of an electro-mechanically powered missile using wirelessenergy projected to it by a power beam from the ground. These new developmentswere probably spurred on by necessity—the “mother of invention”—since without awireless energy system, the prior conception would be rather useless. The powermonopolists could fight that off forever, so Tesla was left to his own devices,unable to count on anyone else. Typical for a true genius, when he was thwartedin one direction he found another way.The earlier conceptions must have been still in Tesla’s mind when he developedthe turbine commercially under the Tesla Propulsion Company slogan, “20Horsepower Per Pound”, with the intention of also using the turbine to drive oneof his specially designed high frequency alternators to power his ideal flyingmachine. After having developed such a light and powerful turbine, which couldturn upwards of 30,000 rpm., with a ten pound unit producing 200 breakhorsepower on gasoline, he also designed and received a patent in 1928 for a newkind of “VTOL” (Vertical Takeoff and Landing)-type propellor-driven airplane, to be powered by two turbines mounted intandem, which would counteract the torque of the prop, and avoid the need forthe stabilizing rotors that helicopters have on their back fuselages. Thisaircraft, if built, would have had a superior weight-to-horsepower ratio—perhapsthree-to-one—and would have been fast in level flight, taking off vertically.On seeing the inefficient heavier aircraft engines then in use, and therequirements of more cumbersome aircraft with greater wing area but lowerwing-area-to-weight ratios, Tesla apparently wished to commercialize on theturbine by designing and patenting the new airplane, which specifically used histurbine, to raise needed capital to complete research and development on hismore expensive flying machine project. In his experiences with prior patents, hemust have learned that a patent would be worthless unless he could get theneeded capital to carry the project out before the patent period expired, andthat the disclosure in a patent would allow others to do so only 17 years aftera patent might be granted to him, during which time his invention could languishfor lack of funding on his part, because the monolithic financial interests wereset against him. And yet there was the patented airplane and no one built it.While in the initial stages of development, Tesla seemed quite unaware of thetrue power of “the force”, until his early field tests proved that it was“tremendous”. In the years 1893 and 1894, Tesla had “completely worked out” hisDynamic Theory of Gravity”, that is, at least in “theory”. Inherent to thattheory, was his propulsion system, yet in the formative and theoretical stages.To publish his theory however, would have been tantamount to disclosing thebasic technology as well, which would have allowed his competitors with moremoney and resources to complete and take credit for the most important work ofhis life, and the greatest invention of mankind. Tesla lacked the necessarymoney, and could not raise it. He could not protect himself by patent, until hecompleted and tested a working model of large enough scale to impress theaircraft industry and the government. Fatefully, it was during this time ofgreatest financial need, when he still had the physical stamina to carry theproject out, that he was run ragged by bill collections and foreclosures, at thebehest of J.P. Morgan and his cohorts, all with the intent of crushing Teslabecause he kept coming up with new electric power systems which made his priorsystems obsolete. Since the newer systems would have ruined Morgan andRockefeller, and since any invention which Tesla marketed for great profit wouldhave allowed him the resources to build more energy systems, he had to becrushed. Tesla never seemed to fully realize that Morgan’s pseudophilanthropybecame nothing more than a scheme to compromise Tesla’s contract with himself,and a way of falsely inducing his reliance on others rather than on himself.This treatment set Tesla back emotionally as well as financially, after he hadinvested all his cash in his project, and reduced him at one point to a heap ofgroveling nerves, literally begging Morgan to make good on his promises, to noavail, but like all truly tragic figures, there was a peripides—a reassertion ofthe tragic hero’s excellent and untarnished Arturian powers—before he passedheroically into the oblivion of death, as his discoveries, like the swordExcalibur, sank beneath the waves of the lake of ‘national security’ lies, tothe inurement of corporate greed, coercion and extortion.The only power that Tesla seemed to have left, was that of withholding hisdiscoveries from the world, to protect his secrets from the pilfering paws ofthe looters, until and unless he could receive the compensation and credit whichhe deserved, but that didn’t matter, because they got it all before his corpsewas cool, and never paid him so much as a dime for his trouble.After becoming aware of the true power of “the force”—one hundred billionthousand trillion thousand trillion times stronger than gravity—Tesla began topursue the idea of an “on-board” power system for a manned craft to be used forpersonal and commercial transportation, with his “wireless transmission ofpower” to be relegated to a robotic, remote controlled, electric poweredtransmission of mechanical power to a “missile” from the ground, for use inwarfare. After a long period of silence following his field testing of a workingmodel of the electro-mechanically propelled missile in 1915, Tesla beganreferring to the propelling force as “tremendous” in his later announcementswhich began in the ‘30s. “Tremendous” does not mean something which reactsfeebly, to barely get off the ground, but to something which rises with greatand astounding force, such as the way I saw a flying saucer perform in1953...only ten years after Tesla’s death. If “tremendous” meant something likean airplane or conventional rocket—as the CIA/NASA mis-informers haveidiotically attempted to misconstrue —then what would be the word to describe aforce which propels a flying saucer at 36,000 mph in three seconds?The words “means of propulsion” used by Tesla in his 1940 interview with WilliamL. Laurence of the New York Times are of the utmost importance for thoseinterested in understanding both the misinformation conspiracy as well as thescanty documentation of Tesla’s concealed discoveries. In their context, thesewords denoted something which was different from the autos, planes, trains andships then in existence, else why mention them and why would it be “new”? Thesewords obviously meant an on-board electromechanical means to be used on his“ideal” flying machine, either manned or unmanned, controlled “mechanically” bya pilot on board, or “remotely by wireless energy” by a controller on theground. It did not refer to a “projectile” such as a “pellet” or “bullet”, whichhad no “propulsion system”, and was merely “repelled” by a gun of some sort, andit did not refer to any kind of aerodynamic “airplane”—hence Tesla used the term“flying machine”—since his machine was to have no wings, ailerons, propellers or“outer appurtenances of any kind”. “Propulsion” here means an on-board systemfor perpetuation of motion by electromechanical means supplied with electricalpower by either on-board turbine-driven generator or by mechanical energy andcontrol signals transmitted by power beam from the ground. The idea ofinterplanetary travel appealed to Tesla, with the idea that, so long as theenergy for propulsion could be transmitted from the earth, a space ship wouldrequire no fuel tanks. But the term “veritable ropes of air” raises a questionas to whether these ships will work in outer space.In a letter to his friend and financial supporter B.A. Behrend in the 1930's,Tesla referred cryptically to what may have been his propulsion discovery: “WhatI shall accomplish by that other invention I came specially to see you about, Ido not dare to tell you. This is stated in all seriousness”. Tesla may have beeninferring a plan to discover “other worlds” in outer space, if some version ofhis flying machines would work there. We really can’t know for certain how allof Tesla’s secret inventions worked but the government knows. There seemed to besome differences between Tesla’s earlier statements and later ones whichindicate that he had several different related inventions and that he may nothave understood himself exactly how some of them worked.Tesla said that all bodies contain “electrical content” and that they behave asresonant bodies which interact with rapidly varying electrostatic forces andether to determine their gravitational interactions and movements in space.These theories were tested and confirmed to some degree in his 1899 ColoradoSprings experiments. The U.S. government never gave Tesla the time of day, andhis great propulsion discovery slipped into the eager hands of the Nazi elite,when Wernher von Braun engaged and began development in the “p2 Projekt” at LosAlamos, New Mexico in 1936. Tesla apparently participated—in fact may have beenthe project leader—in these early tests in New Mexico from 1936 to 1938. VonBraun took the data back to Germany in the Winter of 1937, where research anddevelopment was conducted at Peenemünde in the Baltic, with undergroundmanufacturing facilities elsewhere in Germany, until these secrets and otherswere traded to American corporations and the U.S. government in exchange underOperation Paperclip, just after the armistice, for amnesty for many warcriminals, along with an agreement for several thousand people to work for theU.S. government and American corporations. Anyone having important technicalinformation was protected. The Nuremberg Tribunal was a show trial which did notprosecute anyone having advanced or “strategic” technical knowledge or abilitieseven though they may have been guilty of crimes against humanity.I have always associated the ship which I saw up close in 1953 with Teslatechnology, because of the copious electrostatic discharges (which I call “Tesladischarges”) because it was obviously an electric flying machine, and becausethe ship’s precession indicated gyroscopic stabilizers as Tesla emphasized. Andbecause the ship moved with a force consistent with the fact that theelectromagnetic interaction is 1040 times greater than the gravitationalinteraction.In 1912-14 Tesla mentioned “veritable ropes of air” which “pulled” his shipthrough space (there being no “thrusting” from behind) and said that his shiputilized the same phenomena—the adhesiveness and viscosity of fast moving gas—asthat which propelled his smooth turbine blades around, except in this case the“gas” he referred to was the ether. He stated that his ship or a missile basedon his system could be “...dropped on any point on the globe” electrically. Isit possible that Tesla stumbled on something much more powerful when conductingtests, attempting to use air? Is it possible that J. J. Thomson’s description ofthe specific action of the technology involving the ether is more accurate (that“...the aether is itself a storehouse of mechanical momentum”)?There are those who have interpreted or will interpret Tesla’s statements asmeaning that his flying machine technology was simply a matter of using histurbine and Tesla pump to suck air in and shoot it out the rear of the machineto produce the thrust to “repel” it like a “jet” engine, yet we know this iswrong because of Tesla’s use of the word “pull”, and there is no way to create a“rope-like” column of air with only his turbine and pump powerful enough to“pull” his ship. And there is certainly no technology based on such a primitiveidea which could accelerate a ship to 36,000 mph in three seconds as I observed,with no sonic boom or shock wave. And with no intake ports or jet nozzles on therear. But there is a technology based on Tesla principles which could and did doso electrostatically, and that technology appears to have been more cogentlydescribed by J. J. Thomson. And it is also possible that what J. J. Thomsondescribed was partially technology which Tesla was attempting to keep secret.Thomas Edison joined the Theosophist organization of Madame Blavatsky in 1872.Their main activity seemed to be industrial espionage, concealed behind a veilof an interest in mysticism. I think Edison used the organization to stealtechnology from other inventors. Tesla was invited to join in 1895 and herefused. His laboratory was burned to the ground soon after his refusal. J. J.Thomson was also associated with the Theosophists. Was some of the technology hedescribed obtained from Tesla through Theosophist espionage?The REAL Cover-upEver since Tesla’s saucer discovery came under the control of the U.S.government in 1945, there has been in effect a false propagandaprogram—originally developed by the RSHA VI— Reichsicherheitampt VI, or“National Security Agency Division 6\"— the division of the Gestapo which wasinvested with the highest secrets of the German Reich (managed by GeneralReinhard Gehlen) which included and controlled in Nazi Germany the equivalent toour own UFOlogy, new age—and what I call the “pseudo-skeptic misinformationdissemination network.” The U.S. government simply employed the whole Nazisaucer counterintelligence apparatus, and it was some of the original Nazipersonnel employed at Holloman, A.F.B., at Alamogordo, New Mexico, who designedand implemented the 1947 “Roswell Hoax”. Though shadowed with ostensiblemilitary and “national security” vestiges, this cover-up has been protracted onbehalf of a coercive monopolist corporate state— even in Germany—ever since theacquisition of the secrets by the Nazis, for if the technology had gotten eveninto the hands of private Germans at that time, the Nazi state’s days would havebeen ever so much more shortly numbered.Can you imagine the effect of this kind of transportation technology in privatehands? It would allow the common man to go anywhere in the world, to visit allthe places which he cannot presently afford the airline fare to. Yet a small,privately-owned flying saucer would cost less than an automobile to build, woulduse practically no fuel, would travel thousands of miles per hour, would last along time, and would require practically no maintenance.Can you imagine the effect it would have on totalitarian communist, fascist orcorporate state governments and ‘privileged’ economic interests? Can you see thebottom drop out of the overpriced real estate market, when it suddenly becamepossible to live anywhere, even in places where there are no roads? Can you seethe problems along the borders of countries, if saucers could fly across andback without checking through “customs”? (The conservatives and totalitariansare horrified by this possibility, as if our borders do not already leak likesieves.) The main problems, as you can see, are with the paranoid and criminalfears of power crazy authorities and coercive monopolist industrial interests,who would suddenly lose a lot of the power necessary for them to keep their“jobs” protecting and maintaining the interests of themselves and the coerciveelite of whatever kind.These considerations are the ones which indicate the perpetrators of any“cover-up”. There is much talk on TV programs, radio talk shows, newspapers,books, magazines and videos about a “...coverup of our government doing businesswith aliens for fifty years”, etc. But if you can see it on prime-time TV everynight of the week, the only “cover-up” which can be presumed, is one which isopposite to the one they pretend to be telling you about. Such programs are thecover-up. The volume of these lies is so great that it is almost incredible,considering the fact that they are evidence of our own government covertlyacting behind the scenes to lie to us. Whenever government is involved inbroadcasting such trashy BIG LIES to every household in America, it is goodcause to ask, “What else are they lying to us about?”This book, along with my prior ones, are dedicated to the objective of bringingthis technological secrecy and socio-economic dictatorship to an end. We arebeing robbed of our future. This 2010 Edition was called for because between theSecond Edition of 1998 and the present, more information has come to me, but theoriginal nature of the cover-up has never changed since 1947.CHAPTER I: THE OCCULT ETHER THEORY AND ELECTRO-MECHANICAL PROPULSIONThe theory which I espouse in this book is based on what can be corroboratedthroughout the words and developments of Nikola Tesla and their logicallyconstrued implications, in combination with other special information linked tothat, as presented here and in my prior book, Space Aliens From the Pentagon(now in its Third Edition as PENTAGON ALIENS). This theory is close to Tesla’sDynamic Theory of Gravity, and I like to think that it even suggests somecorrections that Tesla himself made or would have made if we only knew what isconcealed in government vaults.Like most theories, this theory is incomplete, may contain errors, and willrequire further development, tests, corrections, and revisions, either by myselfor by others in the future. I have stated here my basic thinking on the subjectup to this time, which has progressed somewhat since my prior books.Since this book is for the greatly uninformed public, as well as for theresearcher, I will make an effort to couch it in laymen’s terms —for I am myselfa layman—and will provide some illustrations where helpful, to give a reasonablegrasp of my concepts based on Tesla’s concepts which I have developed as aconsequence of what I have also witnessed. I do this rather than engage in a“quantum mechanical” mathematical orgy, which is usually combined with pages ofdull equations and numbers which proceed logically from the contradictory andunproven illogical premises which are so prized by that ilk. It is as if to say,“Hey! Look at me Ma, I can do lots of math!”“Ether Physics” by its very nature and name is subatomic physics, which to memeans “sub-protonic” and “sub-electronic”. I am not so concerned with sub-atomicnuclear particles per se, but rather with what I believe are the finite buildingblocks of the proton and electron, which exist within the ether in simpler form.I will leave all the quarks, muons, mesons, leptons, etc. to the “RelativisticQuantum Mechanics” (hence “R.Q.M.s”) and their “elegant equations”.Characteristics of Basic Ether ParticlesThe basic ether particle, on order to respond to the negative electrostatic D.C.Potentials described by Tesla, must have a positive nucleus—a “protette”—and anegative sub-electron—an “electrette”, and is surrounded by an insulative fluidas Tesla said. As you may have noticed, this scheme is a scaled-down version ofthe basic hydrogen atom, with its proton and electron. Like most atoms, it isnormally neutral and in equilibrium, but is much smaller, being ultra-fine. Dueto its tiny size and neutrality, it can pass easily through solid bodies whichit permeates as it moves, yet the ether as a whole behaves like a solid inrespect to rapidly-varying electrostatic potentials of specific frequencies,from the infra-red through the visible light frequencies, which disturb itsequilibrium, yet, though we can feel it, it appears to be transparent andinvisible to the naked eye.Like hydrogen gas, there is some elasticity, so it is “elastic” as Tesla said,but is incompressible. Due to the tiny size, so called “empty space” isvirtually packed with this very fine matter, which oscillates at such highfrequencies—well beyond that of x-rays—yet the tiny size and normal neutralityallows it to penetrate “solid mass”—which is mostly “space” (which is alsosaturated with ether which must be moved through by a mass). And as J. J.Thomson said, “The ether is the storehouse of mechanical momentum”.Since interstellar space is equivalent to a vacuum containing little gaseousmatter of the conventional type—such as a Lenard tube in which charges easilymove—ether-filled interstellar space is permeated by charges moving freely alongfrozen magnetic lines of force as Hannes Alfvén said.Ether-packed space is also omni-directionally interpenetrated by ultra-fineradiation, which Tesla called “Primary Solar Rays”, which Tesla said werepositive particles propelled by enormous repulsive forces in stars. I thinkthese Primary Solar Rays may constantly “twang” the electron clouds of atomicmatter, creating or powering “electron orbits”, which may be in fact standingwaves in the undulating layers of particulate electronic clouds surroundingatoms and molecules. Since the matter with which these electron clouds areassociated is in constant motion, the clouds are currents, since a “chargecarried around is a current”. The driving force behind the currents appears tobe the motion and the Primary Solar Rays, also by a conversion of weak forcesinto strong ones. Any lost momentum is ‘made up’ by the Primary Solar Rays andthe conversion of weak to strong forces, the ultimate source of extra force(“free energy”) needed to make up for the losses in the universe. The conversionof weak forces into stronger forces will do more work in the same period oftime. The Primary Solar Rays are an example of this process. With the UFO, thegravitational, kinetic force of a turbine propelled by chemical reaction isconverted into electrostatic force which is much stronger than gravity. This isfree energy.The ether must have an almost balanced charge-to-mass ratio, and respond to bothpositive and negative electrostatic potentials. Tesla said the positive ornegative aspects depended on the conditions. Electrostatic generators provide agood example of the electrical behavior of the ether. At sufficiently highvoltages the positive and negative dynamic sub-charges are separated by magneticfields and condensed as electrons and “holes”. There is some unknown underlyingreason why these charges are of specific magnitude, which is yet to beexplained, but the quantum theory— originated by ether physicist MaxPlanck—practically admits that there are subdivisions of basic electricalcharges, and that electrons are not “indivisible”. This is one basic bone ofcontention, since if electrons are divisible, Relativism must fall. I think the“basic charge” which has been perceived as that of the electron, appears to betime-related, since electrical current moves virtually at the same speed aslight, therefore my opinion is that the electron charge is probably the quantityof charge accumulated from a discrete number of negative sub-charges carried byether over some discrete unit of time due to the positive mass units of ethercomposing a proton. This may in turn reflect the distance traveled through spaceof a proton during that time, with the charges circulating as a current betweenthe ether and grosser matter.High voltage force—either in electrostatic impulses or in radiation—isapparently necessary to force the ether to form momentum-carrying tubes offorce, as an ‘equal and opposite reaction’. The principle applies to Tesla’spropulsion system, which was a sort of electro-mechanical one. Strong, highvoltage, negative charges are necessary to penetrate the insulating fluidsurrounding the ether to react with the positive ether mass to cause the“inertia resistance” of the ether to be “asserted” as Tesla said, so as toaccess its mass—and that of the atmospheric gases locked to it—to be possiblypulled against by the ship. The screwing force of tubes of force which rotatearound irrotational vacuous ether cores may be the “positive mechanical action”referred to by Tesla and the “pulling force” involved. Unless the tubes of forceare dissolved in the conductors of the ship imparting momentum to it, as J. J.Thomson said (more on this later). The tubules could be the product of therotation imparted by a magnetic field to electrical currents, which areconsolidated to effect changes in momentum.The rapidly-varying electrostatic forces emanating from the earth rigidify theether within the earth’s electric field, which may form a virtual stationaryanchor which an electro-mechanical craft may possibly lock onto to propel itselfthrough space. Although the ether ‘anchors’ are stationary relative to the earthand carried along by the earth’s electric field, this carry-along ether has avelocity of many thousands of miles per hour relative to the ether outside theearth’s electric field. Just as the so-called “gravity field” diminishes as thesquare of the distance, the relative movement of the ether decreases outside theearth’s electric field.If gross matter is formed of ether particles, what is the “mortar” which holdsthem together? Tesla said the ether was particles within an “insulating fluid”.This fluid is apparently what ‘wets’ positive bodies and particles as a ‘perfectfluid’ which flows everywhere. Does it have viscosity and adhesiveness? If itdoes then forcing the incompressible medium past or through the ship could bethe key, sort of like swimming under water.While the ether is invisible to the eye—because its period of vibration isbeyond the visible frequencies—it is not imperceptible. As we move, we can feelthe ether accelerating, decelerating, or changing directions within our bodies.When running, we feel the resistance (“inertia”) created within the atoms of ourbody, as a response to changes in momentum, as the tubes of force are forced indifferent directions or in accelerating or decelerating pathways through theatoms and molecules of our body. Once we reach a constant velocity, we can feelhow the tubes of force ‘bore’ through our mass, delivering the momentum theether carries, which tends to carry us along in level and straight lines (thepaths of least resistance). Once in constant velocity we must supply onlywhatever momentum is shed through wind or mechanical friction or erraticmovement, in order to maintain constant velocity, and we can feel all this. Wecan also see the effects of the ether in the behavior of everyday objects—theway they resist changes in movement, fall, accelerate, gain momentum, tumble,roll, collide, shatter, bounce, or come to rest. I analogize a solid mass to aflock of geese, maintaining its “formation” (“shape”) as it flies trough the air(ether) as a single unit:[Image00003.gif]Newton’s laws fail to tell us “why” gravity exists, what forces create it, orwhy the force varies “directly proportional to the masses, and inverselyproportional to the square of the distance between (the centers of the) bodies”.If gravity is a force at a distance, why would a body in outer space becompletely free of it? Why would the force of gravity between the earth, forexample, and the moon, not affect a body floating in outer space between thetwo? If that were true, would the force selectively pass through the bodywithout affecting it? This fact negates Newton’s laws. Even Newton explicitlyadmitted that his laws failed to address causes, and only claimed tomathematically describe “apparent effects”. But what may “appear” to be true maynot be all or any of the truth.“Electrical content” is inherent to all solid matter. Atoms contain nucleicomposed of positive protons and neutral neutrons (neutered by the tightly boundelectrons within them). Around these nuclei are negative electrons. All matterwhich contains electrostatic charges and is in motion, represents “electriccharges carried around”, hence currents, which create magnetic fields. Sincemagnetic fields impart rotation to electromagnetic fields, this creates rotatoryelectromagnetic tubules within the ether within the fields. These tubules rotatearound irrotational vacuous cores in space and within solid bodies relative totheir motions, and are aligned by the relative motion along the axis of auniform or changing movement, and impart momentum when dissolved in a body.While at any given time the pitch and diameter of a micro-helix is fixed, itinvolves a logarithmic spiral or vortex either inward or outward each time thevelocity changes, and the pitch resists, then adjusts to the new momentum ordirection. But with Tesla’s system this polarity of movement can be changedelectromagnetically, so that all the internal reactions can be instantlyreoriented, thus eliminating such things as centrifugal force and inertia,created by the tendency to remain in a particular state of motion.According to Tesla, the earth and all electrostatically charged bodies have amaximum negative surface charge of approximately 20 esu/cm2 (20 electrostaticunits per square centimeter), an atmospheric phenomenon due in part to theionizing effects of cosmic radiation and lightening. The relativelynon-conductive, insulating and dielectric properties of the atmosphere play apart. Beneath the earth’s surface charge, the semi-conductive crust contains avast ocean of surplus electrons. The earth’s surface charge is more or less aconstant, due to the earth’s surface area, varying somewhat by altitude due tothe changes in atmospheric pressure and moisture content of the air, as well asthe incidence of cosmic radiation and its frequencies. This charge leaks upwardconstantly but is maintained by lightening.The nuclei of all atoms—including hydrogen—possess net positive charge. This isbecause the basic positive charge of a proton exceeds slightly the magnitude ofthe basic negative charge of the electron. Hydrogen, with its single proton andsingle electron, has the highest charge-to-mass ratio and the lowest gravity ofall elements. As one moves up Mendeleev’s periodic table of elements,progressively increasing in complexity and mass number above hydrogen, elementspossess progressively lower charge-to-mass ratios, since the comparative ratiosof electrons match the number of only the protons in the nuclei. Yet since theneutrons are not negative, they add to the positive mass relative to the atom,but contribute nothing to effective electrical charge, and the ratio of neutronsand mass increases up the chart. In relation to the earth, this leaves an excesspositive mass, the semi-conductive surface of which is capable of receiving andmaintaining a negative charge surplus, mostly brought to earth by the thousandsof lightening bolts per second, and retained due to the dielectric andinsulating properties of the atmosphere.The constant electrical discharges from the atmosphere by lightening are drivenby the cosmic rays and motion of the earth, which converts the electrostaticcharges to currents. This was confirmed by H.A. Rowland’s experiment. Sinceatmospheric gases are insulators, the mostly alkaline, semi-conductive crust ofthe earth is largely an electron donor material, which maintains a largereservoir of negative charges insulated by the atmosphere. Cosmic rays strikingthe rarified light gases of the ionosphere, maintain the ionosphere’s positivecharge. The excess negative charges of the earth are meanwhile ejectedconstantly by the rapidly-varying electrostatic discharges (the “microwaves”)which Tesla discovered. The effects of gravity also helps, since helium andhydrogen, both light, electropositive gases, gravitate to the ionosphere.Between the ionosphere, ca. 620 miles above, and the earth’s surface, there is agradient of ca. 150 volts/meter, totaling about 176 million volts, creating aconsiderable electric field, but the electric field extends far beyond theionosphere. This electric field creates electrical displacement in the etherwithin it. The effects of the electric field on the ether is almostinstantaneous, since near the speed of light, as the ether passes from “freespace” into mass, where the gravitational force is exerted downward, toward thesource of the electric field. The relative weakness of the so-calledgravitational force however might be due to bodies on earth being pulled upwarddue to the downward motion of the tubes of force being brought down by therapidly-varying electrostatic discharges from the earth.There is no significant gravitational effect of earth’s field above thiselectric field. Since earth’s magnetic field encompasses the moon, so does theelectric field. When the ether is placed within a strong electric field, it ispolarized and the negative charges on it are attracted by the positive pole(ionosphere) and repelled by the negative pole (earth). The effect of theseattractive/repulsive forces is to “displace” the ether, and to place thedielectric atmosphere and the ether within a strain. Tesla and other etherphysicists said this strain was the cause of gravitational effects.The Cause of the Apparent “Inverse Square” Law of Gravity?As earth spins, the surface velocity—and the atmospheric velocity with it—at anypoint varies according to its distance from the earth’s axis. An object sittingat sea level moves slower than a body on top Mt. Everest. The voltage potentialbetween the atmospheric gases at higher altitude and the ionosphere is lower,but the voltage potential between the atmosphere and the surface of Mt. Everestis higher, which, along with lower air pressure explains the increased coronaldischarges on mountain tops.The differences in these electrical potentials illustrates why there aredifferences in relative displacement of the ether within both earth’s “gravityfield” and within bodies moving within that field, with a degree of displacementwhich is directly proportional to difference in so-called “gravitational force”and the dielectric strain.This comparison suggests that a body at a higher altitude and velocity has alower gravity because the electric field has a lower displacing influence on theether . This is pertinent to electropropulsion because we must diminish,reverse, magnify and otherwise control this displacement in order to instantlysynthesize and control inertia, momentum, and “gravity”. This displacementinfluences the momentum because it affects the vibrating microhelical tubulesand the way they “bore” through etheric space. “Gravity” appears to be a productof the resistance to a change in ether displacement. The reason why a movingsphere when charged experiences an increase in its “virtual mass”—that is, anincrease in the work required to move it, but not an increase in its gravity—isbecause the “Faraday cage” effect of the increased charges tends to increase theresistance to the movement of the mass through the ether, apparently effected bythe negative surface charges on the sphere.Tubes of ForceDue to the cosmic motion of earth, electrostatic, molecular charges becomecurrents, which create magnetic fields within atoms, molecules, and sometimesponderable bodies such as iron. As stated before, as earth moves through theether, rapidly-varying electrostatic impulses from the earth rigidify the etherwithin earth’s electric field, causing the ether within the field to be carriedalong.The tubes—what Tesla called “moving molecules”—may function like drills, tendingto bore straight paths at a constant pitch and linear velocity, aroundirrotational vacuous cores (consistent with Newton’s laws for inertia andmomentum). Any change in direction or velocity would apparently be met by aresistance (“inertia”). Since all mass is already in motion, it always hasmomentum, acquired from the ether. The inertia exhibited by a body at restrelative to earth is apparently a product of its momentum, so this inertia isreally momentum. Inertia is therefore a resistance of a body to change in itsstate of momentum. The two words are used in different ways, to define “relativechanges” in velocity and/or orientation, but no body is “at rest”.Since the ether near the spinning earth is subjected to the negative impulses(the “current”) and the positive mass of the earth, the ether forms tubes offorce which are attracted downward. With the theory of the moving tubes of forcea mass acquires momentum from the tubes entering it. Under this reasoning, abody sitting at relative rest on the surface of the earth would be attractedupwards. So what attracts the body downward? Could it be that the momentumthrough space that the body already has is somehow being re-directed downward bythe earth’s electric field? Could the momentum from the tubes of force whichcarry the body through space along with the earth be partially deflecteddownward by vertical tubes of force? If gravity is the product of a body’sreaction to the ether’s resistance to a change in its momentum, transferred to amass due to its constantly changing movement, orientation and velocity as itmoves through universal ether-filled space, gravity could be explained. Theexplanation provided by Sir William Thomson and Nikola Tesla are given later inthis book.More on Tesla’s Primary Solar RaysAccording to Tesla, in addition to the ether all space is omnidirectionallyinterpenetrated by ubiquitous “Primary Solar Rays”, particles repelled bypositive forces, causing extremely high velocity and energy. This iselectrostatic inductance, using repulsive rather than attractive forces. Theserays are the product of particles which are projected by the enormous voltagesof stars, including our sun. They may be similar to what contemporary physicistshave called Zero Point Radiation (“ZPR”). One scientist has attributed so-called“blackbody radiation” to the ZPR (T.H. Boyer, Derivation of Blackbody RadiationSpectrum Without Quantum Assumptions, Phys. Rev. 182 [5], pp. 1374-83 [1969]).Boyer also found that a nonlinear dipole can absorb energy from particular modesof the ZPR spectrum (Random Electrodynamics: The theory of classicalelectrodynamics with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation, Phys. Rev.D 11 [4], pp. 790-808 [1975]). Another scientist claimed to measure the energydensity of ZPR at 1094 grams/cm3 , for individual fluctuations of random ZPR, onthe scale of the Planck length (10-33 cm.), by means of a standard radiationdetector, the frequency response of which was specially altered to extend intothe super high frequency spectrum involved (J. A. Wheeler, Geometrodynamics,Academic Press, N.Y. [1962]). In my final chapter, I detail what I think is theextraction of Primary Solar Ray energy in the atomic hydrogen process.These particular researches of 1962 to 1975 are ex post facto, coming long afterTesla’s great discoveries. They merely confirm that, in order for such intenseradiation to pass through space packed with an even finer ether, probablyconsisting of ultra-fine bundles of positive mass, surrounded by negativecharges and an “insulating medium”, as well as passing through other planets andthe earth, it would require the enormous force that Tesla described which isgenerated in stars like our sun, propelling tiny particles which do not reactwith the ether in space, and only react with certain materials which we call“radioactive materials”. This reminds me of the multifrequency response ofinterlinked tetrahedronal silicon dioxide crystals which make up solid quartzcrystals, which can be cut to respond to a wide variety of frequencies.If the Primary Solar Rays pass through space and mass—which we know is mostly“space”—and they react with so-called “radioactive materials” as Tesla said,what is it about the structures of radioactive materials which causes them tocapture the energy of the Primary Solar Rays and to emit radiation? And if so,wouldn’t the development of technology to convert the force of these particlesto usable energy be an excellent way to supply all our energy needs?I have previously mentioned a technology which can use radioactive emissions toionize air and to separate high-energy alpha and beta particles with a magneticfield to produce a huge output of electrical energy.1In reiteration, Tesla’s propulsion utilizes externally projected electrostaticimpulses of high voltage and frequency to “rigidify” and cause the ether toassert its “inertia resistance”, combined with (polarized) rotatoryelectromagnetic tubes of force, which instantaneously impart momentum to propela spacecraft.An Old Wooden Box and a German Inertial Guidance SystemIn 1979, at a Santa Fe flea market, I examined an old wooden box belonging to anelderly Pojoaque man who had been employed as a workman in 1937 at a secretproject called “p2\" at nearby Los Alamos, which was run by Nikola Tesla andWernher von Braun. The man had built the box to carry tools used in his jobthere. He had carved in “New Mexico folk style” a “map” on the lid of the boxshowing the highways, the location and name of the project, the symbol for theproject (a triangle with a dot in its center) which was apparently a symbol forthe Prussian/Masonic “Illuminati” of which von Braun was a member, and the dateof the project. This information was corroborated by my friend Peter van Dresserwho confirmed that von Braun was involved in a German research project at LosAlamos at that time. Pojoaque, where the old man lived, is prominently shown asa large “P” with a zia sign around it. The zia sign is an ancient symbol used bythe Zia American Indian tribe to denote the sun, which they worshiped:1 1. PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY, E. A. Moelwyn-Hughes, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1965.Page 224: “Rutherford and Geiger found the number of α-particles ejected persecond from 1 g of radium was 3.4 x 1010 (k=1.26 x 1041 sec.4 , later determinedby Madam Curie at 1·38 x 10-11 )”. Each particle carries two units of positiveelectricity. This will produce 34 zillion α-particles per second, at 4.5 Mev.The number of charges per second, yields a hugh amperage which, when steppeddown to normal 120 VAC, is staggering. Page 230: “1 atom of radium expels oneαparticle producing 1.5 billion ions, at 4.5 Mev”. Page 231: “One α-particle hasmore than sufficient kinetic energy to bring about all the ionizations whichstand to its credit”, and is “...quantitatively sound”.[Image00004.gif]When von Braun arrived from Germany he was accompanied by 16 top Naziscientists. Dr. Robert Goddard, who shared American Rocket Society technologywith von Braun, purportedly left the project and returned to his workshop atMescalero when he realized that von Braun’s interest was in Nazi militaryapplications. Von Braun was able to acquire the new rocket engine design fromthe Rocket Society’s publication, Astronautics , which he acquired from Dr.Robert Goddard.(NOTE: There has been no publically-available information whatsoever on thisproject and those at Los Alamos who later conducted the Manhattan Projectapparently had no idea as to what the old barn used by Tesla and von Braun inthe “p2 Projekt” was for, or that it had an historical significance, until myfirst book was published in 1993. The barn had been rented from Spanish LandGrant heirs by the p2 Project about 1934. Around 1979, LASL, not knowing what itwas used for, had cleaned out the contents of the old barn, removed all thecopper wire used on the coil forms, and sold the contents to salvage dealers. Itwas obvious that the old wooden forms, which were mostly rough sawn planksconnected together with dowels, were Tesla coil forms. I purchased two basesused for tuning coils, which had the coils removed from them. Handwriting inpencil on the forms matches that of Nikola Tesla. After reading my book, LosAlamos National Laboratory personnel went to one of the nearby salvage dealersand retrieved the contents which he had purchased. He apparently had takeneverything except the forms which I had purchased because nobody else wasinterested in them, or had large enough trucks to carry them away. The old barnwith all its recovered contents (except my two bases) is now preserved underlock and key for historical purposes.)The weekend in 1979 following my viewing of the old wooden box at the Santa FeFlea Market, I went to an Albuquerque salvage company, “King’s Surplus City”, oneast Central Avenue, where I often bought military surplus things related to myresearch and inventing, and was pleased to find a very unusual pile of materialstacked in a separate little pile. On top the pile was a device which Iimmediately recognized as a type of navigational “compass” which would berequired on the early flying saucers I had witnessed during my back yardsleep-outs in Kermit, Texas, between 1949-53, which turned in increments ormultiples of thirty degrees. The device showed thirty-degree increments, and hadfourteen contacts—twelve for each of the directions, and two for the six-voltmotor which rotated the compass ring to indicate the correct flight heading. Thelabel showed it was manufactured on Oct. 1, 1943, in lot 127-178 (52 devices),for a project named “KT-p2\". (I interpret this as “Kurskreisel-Tochterkompass -p2\" which in English would mean “Navigational-Gyro Slave-Compass - p2\". Thedevice was called a “Peiltochterkompass” (a “polar slave compass”), which wascontrolled by signals from a “Meisterkurskreisel” (a “master navigationalgyro”), which means that the device was half of an inertial guidance system,which requires a master gyro for its completion. The navigational master gyro,mounted on gimbals, was pointed at the Pole Star—either Polaris or Arcturus—andmaintained the true north heading no matter where on earth the ship flew.Contacts on the gyro sent signals to the twelve contacts on the slave compass totell it which of the twelve 30°-increments the ship was following. When the shipchanged directions, a small D.C. electric motor came on and rotated the flightheading ring to the correct direction in relation to the Master Gyro.Development of the systems was imperative for the flying saucer, since amagnetic compass would be worthless due to the “Faraday cage” effect of theelectric field surrounding the saucer, which would block out the magnetic fieldof the earth. The master gyro was calibrated to the Pole Star prior to takeoff,and would continue to hold that position during flight, so that the “slave”(“-tochter” or “daughter”) would have that as a reference, in order to actuatethe six-volt motor and turn the geared compass heading ring to reflect thecorrect direction of flight, in 30-degree increments. This particular type ofPeiltochterkompass was used on a circular ship which could turn peripherally—in360 degrees, frontwards, sideways, backwards, etc., in increments or multiplesof 30 degrees—while other devices were used on some of the latest types ofGerman “V” (for “Vergehtungswaffen” or “Revenge-Weapons”) rockets, which carriedneutron bomb warheads, and were fired from underwater from special smallLafferenz Project submarines which were towed behind the latest“Electro-U-Boats” used in the final “Stalemate” which I detailed in the thirdedition of Space Aliens From the Pentagon ( Pentagon Aliens ). This submarinemissile delivery system had been tested (prior to the Stalemate ) in the Balticby Dr. Ernst Steinhoff, who died in Alamogordo, New Mexico in the 1990s.This type of (now) relatively primitive navigation system was one which I knewhad to have existed at the time of my 1946-47 night time sightings, in which thesquadrons of high altitude flights from New Mexico turned in increments of 30degrees. Similar systems were used in American military aircraft during WW II,but those systems were not designed to facilitate instantaneous sharp turns in30-degree increments in the 360-degree range. Those devices were also notdesigned to be mounted horizontally as this one was, but were mounted on thevertical faces of instrument panels.Tesla's ships were all of what I call the “linear” type, long and narrow. TheGermans apparently contributed the circular or “saucer”-type ships, unlessTesla's designs which are presently concealed by government secrecy contain thattype.During my graduate school years in the department of art at the University ofTexas, 1965-70, I often drew hypothetical diagrams of such a navigationalcompass.Several years after I had published photographs of the KT-p2, there were webpages placed on the Internet by a German source--apparently our own CIA----whichattempted to fabricate a different use for the devices, in order to counteractwhat I have said about it and to debunk me. The fatal error of thismisinformation is the obvious omission of a “master” gyro which signaled the“slave” compass the true north heading by which it could navigate. Without themaster compass the device would not only not be a slave compass, it would beinoperable. That omission shows the misinformation to be what it is, lies.Perhaps the agents who created the misinformation were not given access to thosecomplete secrets because of “compartmentalization”. It is however a fact thatthe devices, combined with other devices, were also adapted to other uses, suchas the following into England of the VOR beams projected over England by theAllies to carry out night bombings over Germany.The following photographs are of the 1943-vintage NaziKurskreisel-Tochterkompass—also labeled a Peiltochterkompass — which came fromclassified salvage at Sandia Base in Albuquerque:[Image00005.gif]The letters “p2\", which designated the 1936-38 project (two years when von Braunwas in New Mexico before WW II) run by Tesla and von Braun, were incorporatedinto the official secret namedesignation for the Nazi flying saucer project in1943 Germany and displayed on the navigational Peiltochterkompass. “p2\" isapparently a combination of rapidly-varying electrostatic potentials whichinitiate the propulsion of the ship and high-frequency currents which are usedto aid in this according to Tesla theory. More on this later.As explicitly detailed in Space Aliens From the Pentagon (repeated in PentagonAliens), in 1957, as an Air Force member of the 26th Strategic ReconnaissanceWing, SAC, Lockborne AFB, Ohio, with a Top Secret Clearance, I saw the original16 mm reels of intelligence film made during WW II by my 8th Air ForceIntelligence group in 1943, during the night-time bombing raids of theindustrial center at Schweinfürth, Germany. That film was made by members of mysame group during WW II, and the original film was in our film library. The B-17bombers were “buzzed” by small, one-man type Tesla flying machines, which flewat very high speeds around the bombers, apparently in order to draw the fire ofthe gunners and interfere with their missions. This was a tactic apparentlydesigned to distract the gunners so the “Komets”— Messerschmitt rocketplanes—could get in close to use their 30 mm cannons on the bombers.In the spring of 1945, as Russia closed in on Berlin, General George Patton tooka special armored group deep into territory encircled by the Russians to theNazi rocket research center at Peenemünde, on the Baltic. Attached to thisgroup, disguised as “tank commanders”, were Army intelligence officers speciallytasked to retrieve all flying saucer materials and/or destroy the same at thatproject, along with retrieval of any technical drawings, etc., of strategicimportance, before the area could be captured by Russian troops. On discovering200 celestial guidance systems deep underground in a salt cave, General Pattonwas infuriated on being ordered to destroy the systems by his superiors, sayinghe could successfully get them back behind Allied lines, and being unaware ofthe fact that the technical drawings and specifications for the systems, as wellas functional Nazi flying saucers were already in American possession. Thedocumentation which I found of this trip to Peenemünde by Patton and his grouphas been removed from all war histories. The “fix” to hide the saucers wasalready on in 1945. And who are the authors of this fix?Subsequent to my purchase of the Peiltochterkompass, security agents learned ofmy possession of it and knowledge of what it was, so they went to Mark King, sonof the owner of King’s Surplus City, and grilled him. He showed them a bill ofsale from Sandia Base, pursuant to his purchase of the small pile of salvagefrom a Sandia Base employee who usually brought salvage from that base to sellto him. As it turned out, the man, who was under secrecy orders as an employeeof that base, had stolen a pile of classified salvage and sold it for his ownprofit, using a “double-receipt” process intended to cover his tracks, but thesecurity people at Sandia put the man under surveillance, caught him doing itagain, and charged, convicted and jailed him.They could not get the device back from me, because I was an “innocentpurchaser”, and because it would confirm the stillclassified purpose of thedevice, in violation of security orders.I had purchased an inertial guidance system from a 1943 Nazi flying saucer,which was subsequently brought to Sandia Base in 1945 under Operation paperclip,along with over 116 scientists and over 15,000 German military and technicalpersonnel, brought to New Mexico as part of a secret ‘deal’, made prior toOperation Paperclip pursuant to a Stalemate, during which 24 GermanElectro-U-Boats, towing Lafferenz subs carrying rockets with neutron bombwarheads, in attacks concentrated on New York City. The first six of these boatsin the first attack were bombed and destroyed. The remaining 18 in a secondattack managed to coerce a secret conditional surrender for the German ThirdReich.This secret surrender was negotiated between President Truman and Admiral KarlDöenitz by radio telephone conducted through an intelligence Electro-U-Boatwhich was located off the coast of New Jersey and was revealed to be sunk therein a TV program (Nova or History Channel) in the late 1990s. Pursuant to thatsecret surrender, a provision was that the captains of the remaining 18 U-Boatswent to the bottom with all hands on board. Consistent to this scenario evidencein that sub was that the captain had ordered an explosive charge detonated inthe conning tower taking the sub to Davy Jones’ Locker, presumably while thecrew sang “Deutschland Über Alles”. An underwater view of the conning towershowed that the explosive charge had been placed inside the conning tower as thesurface was blown outward from it.As to the question of what “p2” meant scientifically, a similar designation wasused by Tesla to denote “potentials”. I think it refers to the use ofrapidly-varying electrostatic potentials in one direction to draw in the tubesof force to impart momentum to the ship and high frequency A.C. in the oppositedirection to block the ether and stop the tubes from moving completely throughthe ship.The drawing below is derived from information contained in Tesla’s 1890slectures and excerpted later in the part of this book regarding Tesla’s “DynamicTheory of Gravity”, insofar as I am able to reconstruct it, since the actualtheory was unpublished by Tesla.[Image00006.gif]For horizontal motion or buoyancy, there must be, attached to the Tesla coil,emitter plates which create the sound waves in the ether with rapidly-varyingelectrostatic potentials. The frequency must not be as high as the microwaverange, as the waves would not penetrate the shell. I see no reason why it is notpossible for these emitter plates to be placed inside the outer shell of theship, shooting the waves through the shell to the outside. These plates musthave thick layers of high dielectric---such as barium titanate---on theirbacksides, so the waves are emitted only on one side in the direction desired.When a plate is flat, the waves are parallel; when convex, fan-shaped; and whenconcave, focused (such as for tractor-beams, to pull smaller objects to theship).A variable-concavity plate could focus on objects at various distances from theship, as desired. This would be a mechanical problem.This seems to explain some of the puzzling maneuvers of the ships observed bymany. Meanwhile, a lower, rapidly-varying electrostatic potential may be placedon the entire ship's surface to “lubricate” it as it moves through theatmosphere without friction or sonic boom, while the directional waves are shotthrough this. This hypothesis appears to agree with what has been observed.This technology has been highly developed for over seventy years since the earlydays at Los Alamos, years before the Manhatten Project came onto the scene.I could only assemble parts of Tesla's technology like pieces of a jigsawpuzzle, from smaller statements he made at various times regarding it. As youcan see in this drawing, based on Tesla’s statements, there is some conflictbetween an ether which is supposedly “incompressible” versus the fact that Teslasometime referred to “compression” of the ether by high frequency alternatingcurrent emissions in the atmosphere. I think he meant by this that the spacebetween ether particles was eliminated. As you will see in the drawing, both thenegative electrostatic ‘brush’ electrode and the A.C. ‘compression’ electrodewould direct the ether carriers in the tubes of force through the mass of theship from the negative electrode, and cause them to be dissolved in theconductors of the ship, imparting momentum to the ship, similar to what J. J.Thomson said. The electrode on the left would create a “veritable rope of air”so that, when paired with the opposite A.C. electrode on the right, wouldaccelerate the ether carriers through the mass of the ship, dissolving them andpropelling the ship. Tesla described this as a “pulling” action (not a“repulsive” action).Many of Tesla’s tests and experiments in Colorado were related to his propulsionsystem. A rapidly-varying electrostatic (D.C.) potential, according to Tesla, atone end of the ship creates sound waves in the ether which somehow draw in themomentum-carrying tubes of force. Meanwhile, a high frequency at the oppositeend of the ship creates a positive potential according to Tesla, which causesthe tubes of force at that end to be blocked, so that the tubes of force at theopposite end are accelerated into the mass of the ship and its contents, to bedissolved in the conductors to impart momentum to the ship. While the ship maybe accelerated or turned so fast that a normal person inside might be crushed,the technology must operate in such a way that every atom of the ship isaccelerated with the same force, in the same direction, at the same time, sothat no excessive force is experienced by a passenger. There was research inGermany during the war which discovered that a pilot in the prone position couldwithstand six times the G-forces as a pilot in the normal sitting position, butthis could not explain the hairpin turns of the ship I witnessed in 1953.Low and High Frequency Electrostatic Potentials And Tesla’s WirelessTransmission of EnergyLow frequency radio waves can pass through solid bodies, and tend to “hug theearth”, while high frequency waves don’t readily penetrate solid bodies, causinga “skin effect” on them, and don’t “hug the earth”, but tend rather to traveloutward away from the earth in straight lines. In his Colorado SpringsExperiments, Tesla was the first person to investigate high voltage waves ofhigh and low frequency, and their terrestrial, atmospheric and solid-bodyeffects. But remember, Tesla was working with a completely new type of wave, notelectromagnetic ones but longitudinal pressure (sound) waves in the ether. Theresults of these experiments were so farreaching, that whatever was said incurrent science journals about them had little effect, because they left otherscientists so dumbfounded that they were paralyzed by mis-comprehension. This isnot taught in electrical engineering schools.It has been said that the basic difference between Heinrich Hertz’ 'transverse'waves and Tesla’s longitudinal waves is that Tesla’s waves were actuallyelectrostatic mechanical compression waves in the ether. Tesla actually saidthat what Hertz was observing was the same electrostatically-inducedlongitudinal pressure waves. In 1934, Tesla stated (Possibilities ofElectrostatic Generators, Scientific American), speaking of the electrode on hiswireless tower erected on Long Island in 1902, “It was to be charged to30,000,000 volts by a simple device for supplying static electricity and power.”Examination of the patent (#1,119,732, filed Jan. 18, 1902) shows “coil B” is aTesla coil tuned to one-quarter wavelength, which produces rapidly-varying(D.C.) electrostatic potentials, resulting in sound waves in the ether, notelectromagnetic waves.High frequency longitudinal waves also make it possible to project forcefulmechanical waves to a specific, distant point. Tesla also developed a methodwith his special aluminum hemispherical bulb for sending waves or 'heavycurrents' along a special “carrier beam” of U.V. or similar high frequencyradiation which we don’t know the exact nature of.Powerful pressure (mechanical) long waves, carried directionally to a distantpoint, can in turn carry additional higher frequency waves superimposed on it,to deliver the high frequency exciting energy at the powerful long-wave peaks.These “sound waves” are apparently converted back into electrical energy by anappropriate Tesla receiver (or maybe just a conductor) at the target zone. Thisappears to have been the basis for Tesla’s “Transmission of Electrical EnergyWithout Wires” invention, as well as his “energy beam” and “death ray”inventions, as the same system can be used for all three. The manipulation ofthese wave characteristics is inextricably involved in Tesla’s propulsion. Theseinventions were undoubtedly stimulated by Tesla’s study of 19th century “etherphysicists”, and his own brilliant intuitions when discovering the rotatingmagnetic field in Budapest, Hungary in 1882. This rotating magnetic fielddiscovery was involved in his “brushless” electric motor because Tesla appliedthe rotatory force of magnetic fields related to the naturally occurringphenomenon spoken of by Faraday, Maxwell, both Thomsons, and several othersknown to Tesla, to his A.C. electric motor inventions.The tubes of force had been discussed in 1881 in England by Thomson, who had notechnology which could be used to apply the tubes to the propulsion of a ship,if that was what he had in mind, and never seemed to mention them in thisrespect until after Tesla had begun to move toward applying the discoveries tohis intended “ideal flying machine” in experiments prior to his 1891 lecture atColumbia College in New York. But Tesla was influenced after he was apparentlyinspired by the writings of William Thomson and J. J. Thomson.I think that Tesla discovered that by using a low frequency mechanical waves, hecould cause, at the quarter wavelength, the eruption of a large pulse whichcould, by carrying a much higher exciting wave, excite the atmospheric gases ina region, to explosively expand them, followed by a tremendous implosion and theabsorption of a great amount or heat in the area, causing immediate freezing.This process would create an initial explosive shock wave followed by theimplosive return wave, similar to nuclear detonation. For example, by using alow frequency of say 50 cps, with a wavelength of 3,100 miles, a pulse could bemade to erupt at onequarter wavelength—775 miles, corrected to 751 miles byvelocity factor. By superimposing an exciting frequency of say 50 megahertz orso, the atmospheric gases could be excited to cause a “cold implosion” whichabsorbs heat. By altering the wavelength and the direction of propagation, theresults could be delivered to any terrestrial point. At least that is myinterpretation.The Tesla ionizing bulb, fundamental to some of Tesla’s “beams”, is a solidaluminum hemisphere, enclosed in a glass vacuum envelope, excited by highvoltage D.C., applied to the center of the hemispherical end. A polarized beamis emitted normal to the flat face center. The frequency and force is determinedby the voltage. The ion beam polarizes, concentrates, and guides a long waveamplified by Tesla’s “extra coil”, to a distant target. This amplified higherfrequency wave superimposed upon it will “ring” in the target area atone-quarter wavelength, in fact ring many times.Outside the bulb, in close proximity to the beam, the rapidlyvarying highvoltage electrostatic impulses create the pressure waves which are emitted by aring-shaped electrode, and is directed along the beam’s atmospherically createdconductive path, projected toward the distant target where the wave peakdelivers it at its “point” of greatest potential.The June 30, 1908 Siberian explosion/implosion at Tungushka may have been arisky test or inadvertent result of Tesla’s giant Wardenclyffe oscillator, andmay have been an undisclosed reason as to why the project was discontinued, andeventually the tower was torn down in 1917. It should also be pointed out thatthis method involved the absorption of heat energy “from the environment”. Thiswas yet another great heat energy-harvesting discovery. Tesla’s method “openedup” the atmosphere to this possibility, consistent with what he said aboutnuclear energy coming from “the environment”. And maybe that is what LelandAnderson was referring to when he delivered Tesla’s eulogy at his 1943 funeral,praising Tesla’s ability to “...pluck heat units out of the thin air.”The Tungushka event may have also been the impetus for a “very tempting offer”made to Tesla by V.I. Lenin, mentioned in retrospect in a November 29, 1934letter from Tesla to J. P. Morgan, Jr., (microfilm, Library of Congress). TheLenin offer would have to have been between 1917 and 1934, and was mentionedunsuccessfully by Tesla in attempt to tantalize Morgan.The following illustration was not a Tesla one as thought by some, but turnedout to be the idea of what another inventor apparently thought was Tesla’s idea,which he himself was trying to cash in on, since Tesla never revealed it indetail. Tesla had something better, a particle beam which was finer in crosssection than a hair, of tremendous power. The government has never revealed thedetails of Tesla’s so-called “Death Ray” invention, but it is hinted at byTesla’s announcement of Sept. 22, 1940 in the New York Times, in an article byWilliam L. Laurence, of Tesla’s Teleforce discoveries. It should be noticed thatthe waves here are focused.[Image00007.gif]Tesla’s TELEFORCE DiscoveriesTesla’s Teleforce discoveries, evolved between 1900 and 1940, supposedly came infour parts, consisting of a “new” way to produce rays in free air without avacuum, a “new” way to create a “very great electrical force”, a “new” way of“magnifying” the force, and a “new” means of space propulsion2 . At least thatwas what was said in books. When I consulted the actual article, I found quite adifference. What Tesla called “His Greatest Achievement”, was “an apparatus bywhich mechanical energy can be transmitted to any part of the terrestrial globe”and which had four practical possibilities (aside from the energy transmissionpart), among which were a means of unfailing communication, a means forscientists to lay bare the physical conditions of the earth, and enabling themto determine all the earth’s physical constants. He called this“tele-geodynamics”, the determination of earth forces at a distance. He had anapparatus2 2. William L. Laurence, New York Times , Sept. 22, 1940, 11, p. 7.which he said was “ideally simple” consisting of a stationary part and acylinder of fine steel “floating” in air. By impressing powerful impulses on thefloating part, he said, it could be caused to react with the stationary partwhich then would transmit mechanical energy through (the ether in) the earth.This involved a “new amplifier for a known type of energy” which could producethe impulses through the earth so they can be picked up whenever and whereverneeded.I have discovered that the “stationary part” is his “Coil For Electromagnets”(Patent #512340, filed July 7, 1893) which was his bifilar coil which stores250,000 times the energy of a ordinarily wound coil of the same size and numberof turns. It is this coil which stores so much energy that it causes the steelcylinder to “float”. The “known type of energy” was of course the magneticfield. Just exactly how he subjected the steel cylinder to powerful impulses isanother of Tesla’s discoveries, which was at least 35 years old at that time. Itwas probably his single terminal (“pancake”) coil. He said it “will beconsidered absolutely impossible by any competent electrical engineer”, a “newmethod and apparatus for producing direct current without a commutator”,considered impossible since the days of Faraday. These “new” discoveries—all ofwhich could work together—were actually a juxtaposition of and differentapplication of Tesla’s devices already tested separately in Colorado Springsexperiments or later in New York or Wardenclyffe, with the exception that by1912, he had tested a missile powered by wirelessly projected “mechanical”energy, and he had also tested a small, oneman flying machine prototype in whichhe apparently ventured out his hotel window at night over New York City inexperimental tests flights, which served as an experimental basis for a muchlarger and more ambitious set of space ships which he had designed, which wererepeatedly rejected by the U.S. government, probably because they thought he wasnuts. In one interpretation, Tesla’s teleforce discovery was apparently a“tractor beam” technology which could reach out and lock onto many tons of airmolecules—or onto the incompressible ether—by which means the “very greatelectrical force” could be used to pull against to propel the ship up or forwardor backward without air or inertial resistance.Tesla said of his flying machine in 19113 , in pertinent part, “Its liftingpower will not depend upon any such delicate devices as the bird has to employ,but upon positive mechanical action.” By “positive mechanical action”, Tesla wasreferring to his “sound waves in the ether” which travel at the speed of light,which are mechanical in nature. Tesla had stated that his training was inmechanical engineering, and that he was primarily a mechanical engineer. In a1929 article in the New York Herald Tribune4 , Tesla stated “I satisfied myselfthat what he (Heinrich Hertz) had observed was nothing else but effects oflongitudinal waves in a gaseous medium, that is to say, waves, propagated byalternate compression and expansion. He had observed waves in the ether much ofthe nature of sound waves in the air.” And, “The velocity of any sound wavedepends on a certain ratio between elasticity and density, and for this ether oruniversal gas the ratio is 800,000,000,000 times greater than for air. Thismeans that the velocity of the sound waves propagated through the ether is about300,000 times greater than that of the sound waves in air, which travel atapproximately 1,085 feet a second. Consequently the speed in ether is 900,000 x1,085 feet, or 186,000 miles, and that is the speed of light.”Even the Nazis were skeptical that the Tesla propulsion technology might work,being unconvinced until Wernher von Braun had actually tested the concepts atLos Alamos in 1936 and 1937, and obtained the final approval of Hitler. Thelarge conical coil form, constructed of rough-sawn pine boards held togetherwith dowels and shellacked, which I saw there from the old barn was about tenfeet from top to bottom, a couple of feet across at the top, and about ten feetacross at its base. I could see where heavy wire—then removed—had been wound onthe boards from which the form was constructed. Almost immediately after vonBraun’s return to Germany in late 1937 in time for Christmas, construction wasbegun on large “cigar-shaped” ships (similar to those shown in the illustrationsTesla commissioned in 1914), using at first the iron pressure hulls of U-Boats,which were already equipped with a hermetically sealable system carrying dieselgenerators for use in the water or the atmosphere, and possibly the helium-based“nuclear” generators which I had heard about in 1947. With the huge differencebetween the weak interaction of gravity and the much stronger interaction of theelectrical attractive force, “Weight is no object” Tesla said.3 3. Tesla’s New Monarch of Machines, Oct. 15, 19114 4. Nikola Tesla Tells of New Radio Theories , New York Herald Tribune, Sept.22, 1929Since Tesla had actually received offers from Russia prior to that time, I hadconsidered the probability that he had cooperated with von Braun in the LosAlamos experiments, through some of the unidentified three laboratories he saidhe was working with in 1937. But I already had the information that von Braunhad been involved in a 1930s Los Alamos project from my friend Peter vanDresser. The old box from the p2 project which I saw in 1979 filled in theblanks. In 2008, I found evidence that indeed Tesla was here in New Mexico in1936, and there was really not very much else he could have been doing here atthat time. In addition to the work at the p2 project Tesla also was involved in1936 in the testing of his wireless tranmission of energy system to run a trainin Santa Fe, New Mexico, another activity which there is virtually noinformation on, even in Santa Fe. The spooks did a good job of cleaning out allreferences.In looking for a probable Nazi spy, there was one who had wormed his way intoTesla’s most intimate confidences, who was later convicted and imprisoned forhis espionage activities in America, but the exact nature of his activities,other than the dissemination of Nazi propaganda, was never specified in thepublic records. This author’s belief is that Tesla’s sale of technology toGerman Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz in 1914, following rejection of thistechnology by the U.S. government, included the technology for Tesla’s electricflying machine, not developed until 1936-38. Tesla’s connection with GeorgSilvester Viereck was the most probable explanation for how Tesla’s propulsiondiscoveries attracted the attention of the Germans and found their way to theinternationally funded “p2\" project (funded by the Germans, the NationalGeographic, the Simon and Florence Guggenheim Foundation and the SmithsonianFoundation).In his 1935 birthday announcement5 , Tesla was extravagant,5 5 New York Times, July 11, 1935 (supra)treating about 30 reporters, press, camera men, news and sound reelrepresentatives to a lavish gourmet luncheon in a private dining room at theHotel New Yorker where he had been living for the previous two years. Thisindicated a new source of revenue for Tesla, most likely from his Germanconnections for the p2 project.The fact that von Braun’s pre-war New Mexico adventures have been subsequentlyconcealed from the public by the Secret Government—a degree of secrecy whichcannot be explained except by reference to the Nazi flying saucer project alongwith appropriating my friend Peter van Dresser’s and his four colleagues' rocketengine design—is compelling.The fact that I was a personal friend to an American rocket scientist namedPeter van Dresser, who was angered by Dr. Robert Goddard’s pre-war work withWernher von Braun, and who was present in New Mexico in the ‘30s and waspersonally familiar with von Braun’s secret Los Alamos activities left littleremaining to be proven, since there is no longer any security basis forconcealing such events, if “rocket research” was the only thing von Braun’spre-war American presence involved. He had already been appointed, just prior tohis trip to America, as the Peenemünde research and the national German rocketresearch leader, and had been promoted by Hitler and Heinrich Himmler toUberstürmbannfuehrer in the SS, and was given a “leave of absence” by Hitler tomake the venture to America. After all, he was at that time in the Wehrmacht aswell as the SS.Willi Ley, the real rocket genius of Germany and von Braun’s tutor, was thefirst scientist invited to America by Peter and the New York branch of theAmerican Rocket Society in 1934. In 1937, Ley was staying at the GreenwichVillage, NYC apartment of Florence and Peter van Dresser, applied for Americancitizenship papers that year, and married a Russian ballerina named OlgaFeldman, so von Braun was apparently invited by Dr. Robert Goddard, by hisarrangements with the Germans, to fill the empty shoes of Ley. I suspect thatall those promotions of von Braun after Ley’s defection were to insure that vonBraun did not also defect and become an American citizen.As shown by archival proof 6 , van Dresser’s group was the actual inventor ofthe first successful liquid-fueled rocket engine—called “A Dependable andEfficient Regeneratively Cooled Liquid-Fueled Rocket Engine” by Peter—theparticular one that Dr. Robert Goddard “appropriated”, and turned over toWernher von Braun, who used it on his V-2s. Peter was co-creator of the AmericanRocket Society and was the editor of its publication, Astronautics . But whenthe military became involved in the research at Mescalero Peter left because hewas a Quaker pacifist and took Willi Ley with him so von Braun was brought in byGoddard from the Third Reich as a replacement in 1936.One of the most telling pieces of evidence regarding the intentionalmisinterpretation of Tesla’s discoveries—especially just after Tesla’s death inJan., 1943, at which point all Tesla’s papers and apparatus fell into the handsof the FBI—is the obvious meaning of the name for his system—TELEFORCE”—whichmeans “force at a distance”. This must be seen in the context of the four listedparts of the system to be used together, being clearly applicable to flyingsaucer propulsion, once I pointed out the fraud, and correctly interpreted thestatement in my 1993 publication.I have to hand it to the spooks, for doing such a good job of concealing theconnection between the flying saucer and the only man who could have inventedit—and whom the public should most readily accept as the inventor who rightfullydeserved the credit for it —even though he never had a fair opportunity ofgiving his greatest discovery to the world as an American, for lack ofopportunity to build a working model of sufficiently developed potential toimpress us. And the German-financed p2 Projekt gave him that opportunity afterthe U. S. government spit in his face. The reason why Tesla never had theopportunity was because of the secret “bill of attainder” placed on his name bythe greedy monopolists who were and still are afraid of technological freedomand a truly free market of ideas, goods, and services. Tesla was a pariah and noone with money and power could touch him in America without being incinerated bythe lightening strikes from the money gods in New York.6 6. New Mexico State Archives, Historical Division, Peter van DresserCollection.CHAPTER II: EXPLORING THE NATURE OF THE ETHERThe Early BackgroundIn 1997, after many years of research and thought regarding the qualities of theether, I decided to see what others had actually said, before completing thisbook. Some of the material available to me was second-hand information, beingwhat someone said someone else had said. I wanted to determine whether or notthese “repeated statements” were accurate, and if not, find the correct ones.After some difficulty, I accessed a copy of the classic, A History of theTheories of the Aether and Electricity, by Sir Edmund Whittaker (1951 revisedand enlarged second edition, Vols. I and II). The 1910 first edition wasprobably the most comprehensive book ever published on ether theory as itexisted in 1910, except it omitted the ether theory of Tesla. The first editionwas printed in Scotland, under the title A History of the Theories of the Etherand Electricity, from the age of Descartes to the close of the nineteenthcentury. The second edition incorporated “new material” related to quantummechanics. Classical theory was in Vol. I, while Vols. II and III gave theorigins of relativity and quantum theory up to 1926. Neither the 1910 firstedition nor the 1951 revised edition mentioned Tesla at all, but thechronological sequence of attempts at electro-propulsion by the Europeansappeared to be “skewered”, with little or no attempt in either edition to pointout what the scientists were actually aiming at in terms of electric propulsion,which was clearly their goal, or to point out this goal as a topic. Thoughinformation regarding Tesla’s work was omitted, there is much valuable relatedinformation in the historical sense in terms of many experiments.In his preface, Whittaker stated that where space is not considered“emptiness”—except for its property of propagating electromagnetic waves (aconcept which is completely wrong according to Tesla’s discoveries regarding thepressure waves)—the development of quantum electrodynamics referred to a vacuumwith a new status as the location of ‘zero point’ oscillations of theelectromagnetic fields and zero point fluctuations of electric charge andcurrent, as well as a polarization conforming to that of a dielectric constant,which is non-unity (i.e., which contains energy). This implies awareness ofTesla’s Primary Solar Rays, but quantum theory inherently excludes thepossibility of “zero-point” fluctuations, since all such waves are alwaysregarded as possessing one-half “quantum”, and this is an internal contradictionof the theory. And the probability remains that all this is completely wrong.Whittaker said that an alleged failure by ether theory proponents to observe theearth’s motion relative to the ether, caused the downfall of the theory, but thefacts show that the relativists, backed by corporate publishing interests,hastily dug the grave and threw the dirt over the corpse of ether theory whileit was still alive, for the wrong reasons (or maybe the “right” reasonsconsidering the lies propagated by powerful interests). Much of the “error” wasdue to focusing on the weakest proponents who failed to realize that a portionof the ether is “carried along” by the earth, and that an optical aberration—an“ether drift”—would have to be observed at some point away from the earth, inorder for an ether to exist. It was asserted that the failure of thisobservation on the earth was the “death” of “the” ether theory. By advertisingether theory’s weakest and most erroneous proponents and ideas, the media madethe RQM’s hasty funeral of ether theory easy, and paved the way for the gulliblepublic’s acceptance of relativism. But remember, truth can flow from lies, butnot lies from the truth, as stated by Schopenhauer.I concluded that Whittaker’s 1951 edition intentionally skewered important factswhich already should have been known to the author concerning Tesla's theory,which I have attempted to straighten out for you in this book. I now feel morecomfortable with my interpretation of Tesla’s theory, than I did prior toreading Whittaker’s book, but that was only because I knew what I was lookingfor. The facts I found are almost exactly as I said in my second edition ofSpace Aliens From the Pentagon . It was unthinkable that a 1910 or 1951 book onthe ether failed to mention Tesla or his ether theory, which contains distinctfeatures not found together in any other ether theory.By gathering and reorganizing Whittaker’s material on electropropulsion intomore proper order, I discovered much “new” (“old”) documentation, that 19thcentury scientists were in pursuit of electro-propulsion, and that there wereinteresting similarities between the thinking of certain scientists of the eraand my suspicions, which could eliminate some erroneous concepts about what theyactually meant, and show similarities to what I had observed on numerousoccasions in the behavior of what were obviously Tesla’s “flying saucers”, sincethe “proof of the pudding” is when it flies across the dinner table or the sky.It was my intent to examine known theories leading up to Tesla, to see what hecontributed, and to determine what happened since that time to obscure,misinterpret and ultimately conceal the truth. To this end, I present for you abrief history and documentation of pertinent ether physics.J. J. Thomson’s “Electromagnetic Momentum”Returning to the concept of the “carry-along” ether, Max Planck, originator ofquantum mechanics, followed this form of ether theory in part, saying that theether had to be irrotational, carried along at the same velocity as earth nearits surface, and compressible and subject to gravity like the atmosphere, inorder for the theory to be true. At best, Planck’s beliefs showed a weakmechanical conceptualization, something unexpected from one purportedly so adeptat “mechanics”.J. J. Thomson (1856-1942), discoverer of the electron, expressed a different andmore plausible ether theory. Thomson had theorized —based on Maxwell’s earliertheory—that a charged spherical conductor moving in a straight line must producedisplacement currents in the medium7 . But this did not purport to beelectropropulsion. In 1893, twelve years later, he claimed to have discovered“Electromagnetic Momentum”, saying “...in an electromagnetic field there isstored in every unit volume an amount of mechanical momentum, proportional tothe vector product of the electric and magnetic vectors”.8 Thomson also was saidto have developed the theory of moving tubes of force—which harked back toFaraday’s earlier work—saying in 1891 that molecular structure is closelyconnected with tubes of electrostatic force, with magnetism regarded as asecondary force. He stated that “...the aether itself is the vehicle ofmechanical momentum, of amount (1/4πC) [D B] per unit⋅ volume.”97 7. Phil. Mag. xi (1881), p. 229.8 8. J. J. Thomson, Recent Researches in Elect. And Mag. xxxi (1893), p. 13.Tesla Shows UpIt is interesting to note that these 1893 “discoveries” by Thomson, althoughfollowing his initial speculations based on Maxwell’s theory, also followedTesla’s lecture before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers atColumbia College, N.Y., on May 20, 1891, in which he described earlierexperiments in which he had pre-empted Thomson’s work with experimentalverification, together with a demonstration of techniques and machinery built byhim which obtained frequencies and voltages which W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) hadsaid earlier in England, were “impossible to achieve”. In that sense, the “goodold boys” in Britain should have admitted that Tesla’s work was prior, afterhaving admitted that they were unable to create the equipment necessary toproduce the required frequencies to investigate and to experimentally verifythese phenomena. But Tesla's theory was different, based on electrostatics notelectromagnetics.J. J. Thomson’s theory, which supposedly linked electromagnetism with momentumin a mathematical and unified way, on paper, somewhat repeated Tesla’s earlierlecture of 1891, proven by his earlier experiments, but Tesla’s theory wasdifferent from Thomson’s and Maxwell’s. Thomson’s electromagnetic momentum couldbe theoretically created only with Tesla’s contrivances, which existed beforeThomson’s “discovery”, and there was no way that Thomson could have reduced histheory to practice or experimentally verified it, because it would not worksince electromagnetic waves cannot be transmitted through the free ether becauseit is not a solid.Though the facts show that Thomson was prior to Tesla in attempting to publish avalid theory, Tesla could not publish prior to perfection of his invention,which was not a factor affecting Thomson. Tesla was apparently the only one toprove his theory by9 9. Phil. Mag. xxxi (1891), p. 149; Recent Researches in Elect. And Mag.(1893), chap. 1.experimental results. Tesla deferred often to Thomson, even though Thomsonattempted later to claim Tesla’s alternating current and high frequencydiscoveries. Thomson’s earlier work10 , concerning a charged spherical conductormoving in a straight line (but involving no “rapidly-varying electrostaticpotentials”) had undoubtedly commanded Tesla’s respect and probably influencedhis work, but Tesla’s 1884 discovery of the rotating magnetic field had beatenthem all to the punch, and documentation shows that because of this he hadarguments with his “learned professors” in Graz, who said that he must be“crazy” for having such ideas during his 1870s student days to prove it.It must have worked a horrible hardship on Tesla, to remain silent about hisDynamic Theory of Gravity , which he did not publish for fear of his technologyfalling into the wrong hands. It was like the Wardenclyffe tower, turning in thewind of incompleteness for lack of money, created by having been falsely inducedinto building an expensive system which would exhaust his energy and financialresources to the point of bankruptcy.In respect to momentum, I would analogize it as follows: When a body is held bya spinning or arcing arm, it contains the changing momentum created by angularmovement. It must continually shed some “old” momentum while accumulating “new”momentum in the new direction. When released, it moves in a straight line vectorcorresponding to the state of the tubes of force which have imparted theirmomentum at the time of release. While held by the arm, centrifugal force wascreated by the tendency of the tubes to impart momentum in a straight line,which created the resistance to change by the tubes at any moment. Oncereleased, “something” (the tubes of force as they then existed) determined thebody’s direction of movement and velocity. These facts are consistent withTesla’s own concepts, in contrast to other theories of the ether or tubes offorce, as I will explain later in greater detail.Most of Thomson’s 1881 work harked back to Maxwell, and before him, Faraday, whohad stated in 1831 that movement of an electrostatically charged body isequivalent to a current, which was10 10. Phil. Mag. xi (1881), p. 229 (Supra.)described as a tube of force created by movement and momentum11 . In hisconsideration of the nature of “ponderable matter”,Faraday had suggested that an atom may be nothing more than a fieldof force—electric, magnetic and gravitational—surrounded by apoint-centre, which is completely penetrable12 . This statement showshow Faraday’s opinions had temporarily been swayed by therelativism of Newton and Boscovitch. Fresnel later stated, ‘Uponconsidering the aberration of the stars, I am disposed to believe thatthe luminiferous aether pervades the substance of all material bodieswith little or no resistance, as freely perhaps as the wind passesthrough a grove of trees’. Fresnel’s concept presupposed that theether surrounding the earth was unaffected by earth’s motion, andgenerally agrees with what is actually observed, except for his failureto consider how the earth’s dynamic electric field affects the ether,and how the ether is not in motion relative to bodies at relative reston the surface of the earth or within its electrostatic field. Along with hisca. 1831 theory of an (elastic) solid ether, andlines of magnetic force, Faraday considered all space as “filled”. Wm. Thomson(Lord Kelvin, 1824-1907), at age 17, based onFaraday’s earlier announcements, introduced into mathematicalscience the idea of electric action at a distance by means of acontinuous ether. In 1846, he analogized electric phenomena withmechanical elasticity. It was his early concept that material atomsmove through the ether ‘without displacing it or compressing it’13 , aconcept later to be adopted partially by Tesla in saying that the ether‘behaves as a fluid to solid bodies, and as a solid to light and heat’. About1853, Bernhard Riemann (1826-66) conceived an etherwhich resisted compression and changes of orientation14 . Riemannthought the resistance to compression caused gravitational andelectrostatic effects, while the resistance to changes in orientationcaused optical and magnetic phenomena, but he failed to developthese concepts further. These early Riemann insights were howeververy influential on later thinkers. He conceived a stationary ether11 11. Faraday, Experimental Res. Sec. 1664; Maxwell, Treatise, Sec. 768-70.12 12. Bence Jones’ Life of Faraday, ii, p. 178.13 13. Letter, FitzGerald to Heaviside, 4 Feb. 1889.14 11. Ann. D. Phys. cxii (1867), p. 237; Riemann’s Werke, 2e Aufl., p. 288;Phil. Mag. xxxiv (1867), p. 368.based on the generally accepted assumption that, as the earth moved throughspace, the ability of one to see a star with a steady image disproved a dynamicether. As to the propagation of electric action through space, Riemann proposeda new equation in which voltage changes outward from charges with a velocity C,but he also failed to follow up with a proper consideration of the properties ofthe ether, because he died too damned young. Some of Riemann’s insights wereverified almost 50 years later, ten years longer than his entire lifetime.Years later, Maxwell, after reading Faraday’s 1831 Experimental Researches inElectricity (3 Vols.), formed a mechanical conception of the electromagneticfield, connecting Faraday’s magnetic lines of force and electrical ideas withthe mathematical analogies of Wm. Thomson, carrying Faraday’s concepts a stepfurther (I have always like to say that Maxwell “put the math to Faraday”,because Faraday couldn’t do much math, though he is recognized as the greatest“experimental philosopher” in history).Faraday was a former Irish bookbinder’s journeyman who got his early educationfrom the books he was binding, and who at age 21 happened to write a letter tochemistry professor Sir Humphrey Davy in 1912 and so impressed him that thefollowing spring he was appointed a chair at the Royal Institution. Faraday hadremarkable insights right from the beginning, which remain long after his death,with so many observations and discoveries which were made without resort totiresome pages of math, lucky for Maxwell, who made his own contributions in theprocess, although many were wrong according to Tesla, when it came to the etherand electromagnetic waves in free space.Faraday had erroneously stated that induced magnetism in iron exists only withinthe iron, was zero in external free ether, and was the basis for electricalinduction. Maxwell’s “electric displacement in a dielectric” was analogous tothe magnetic induction B, which he said may have a value different from zeroeven in the free ether. According to Maxwell, there is a displacement (i.e., anelectric movement away from equilibrium position) wherever there is electricforce, whether “material bodies” are present or not (thus carrying his electricdisplacement into the ether)15 .It had occurred to me that since the earth and bodies “at rest” on it are inuniform motion (or uniformly changing motion) in respect to an ether which isrelatively stationary because “carried along”, that there were differences inelectric displacement of ether in the space within solid bodies and external tothem in space within the free ether, due to the differences in dielectricconstant between the two. I deduced from this that the constant movement ofbodies through a stationary ether-filled space, carrying their charges withthem, create displacement currents.Maxwell had represented Faraday’s lines of magnetic force (vectors of magneticinduction) as the velocity of an incompressible fluid, based on Faraday’ssuggestion years earlier that there may be a “dynamical condition” similar toelectric current, and that the ‘physical lines of magnetic force are currents’of this “fluid”. This agrees with Faraday’s “dynamical condition” of theelectric field ‘carried along’ by the earth, equivalent to a current, whichappears to me to possibly produce the earth’s magnetic field and gravitation, byeffects on the stationary ether within earth’s dynamic electric field. It alsoimplies that magnetic lines of force are the “equal and opposite” reaction toelectrical current as Faraday stated, and vice-versa, though magnetic fields aremore the secondary effect of electric currents as Tesla said. The magnetic fieldis equally important however, in its creation of the rotatory motion imparted toelectricity, which is responsible for the “tubes of force”, which carry momentumwhich maintains the perpetual motion of celestial bodies in the universe, andguides electric currents through the ether forever. And this sounds very muchlike it is in agreement with Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity as well.Cosmic Motion and Local MomentumThe earth orbits the sun at approximately 18.5 miles per second (ca. 66,600mph). The solar system is orbiting the center of the Milky Way much faster, andthe Milky Way orbits the Magellanic Clouds much faster, and so fourth. Thishierarchy of motion and velocity15 15. Maxwell, Scientific Papers I, p. 451; p. 526.increases from the moon, to the earth, the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds,etc., although these pale into insignificance relative to electromagneticvelocity, since movement of force is timerelative. In all, the earth’s velocityand polarity relative to the ether continually varies according to its rotation,orbital position, and galactic cycle. When between the sun and the Milky Way’scenter, for example, it moves relatively slower than when to the “outside”. Asthe earth rotates each day, its polarity of movement relative to the sun rotates15.2 degrees per hour, with a rotational surface velocity at the equator ofapproximately 1,041 mph. This continuous change in polarity is so gradual thatit is sensually imperceptible, but probably contributes to modulating thegravity effects (and may even influence our emotional states!).According to W. B. Morton16 , an increase in charge of a body increases its“virtual mass”, which increases the work required to move it by amount 2e2 /3ac2. This was in correction of J. J. Thomson’s figures. Such a case suggests adynamo consisting of large, insulated conductive balls on each end of a shaftturning at its center on a perpendicular axle, the balls being alternatelycharged and discharged to increase and decrease their “virtual” masses, thusrotating the shaft and turning a generator. But this possibility appears to be afantasy, since the “increase in work required to move the ball” (in Thomson’stheory) may be related to an increase in the resistance to the penetration bythe ether, caused by the presence of the extra charges, which according toFaraday created a “Faraday cage” effect which shuts out the magnetic lines offorce. Without the magnetic lines of force—or with suppressed, deflected ordiminished lines of force—the rotation of the tubes of force by the magneticfield may be diminished or stopped, resulting in a resistance to increasedmomentum. Such propositions gives ample food for thought.If Tesla had continued to increase the earth’s electrostatic charge with hisgadgetry, he might have thrown the earth’s timing off, slowed it down, andpossibly caused it to drift toward the sun or away from it. But that is what hesaid was possible. Being aware of these facts he later addressed them and evenlisted them as future technical possibilities, which also corroborated hisdevelopments in16W. B. Morton, Phil. Mag. Xli (1896), p. 488.the field of propulsion, in case anybody noticed.Local Momentum and Celestial MovementIt’s an odd thing, momentum. If a body is in motion relative to earth, itsmomentum is in the direction of motion, while as a body at rest on a spot onearth, it still has momentum along with the spot’s ultimate motion relative tothe universe. The motion is compound, the ultimate momentum of a body beingtruly a vector which represents all the forces acting upon it. Yet as a body atrelative rest on the earth, it appears to defy all the other vector quantitiesbecause in it's stationary position it becomes a virtual part of the earth.The earth rotates at over 1,041 mph at the equator, so there is that momentum,but the earth’s orbital speed and path around the sun means that the earth’smore general path in the solar system is in the direction of its orbit. A spoton the earth’s rotating surface would appear to a distant observer to be movingslower in its direction of orbital motion over a period of half a day, yet it isalways moving in its orbital path at over 66,600 mph. The rotation alternatelydiminishes and increases the speed of that “spot” through the universe,gradually rotating its ultimate solar orientation once every 24 hours. With thiscompound movement and momentum—of the earth, the solar system, the Milky Way,etc.—we have a more complex pattern of movement, and since a body is inconstant, compound, gradual, ever-changing motion relative to the ether and theuniverse, some interesting effects are bound to be discovered. These effects arenot, as described by Newton’s laws, due to an attractive force acting at adistance, through an empty space. “Force at a distance” requires an etherrelative to Tesla’s Teleforce discoveries and his Dynamic Theory of Gravity .Due to the relatively gradual orbiting and rotating changes in respect toearth’s motion relative to the background ether, a relatively small amount of“externally acting” force (“gravity”) would have to be ever-present in order forNewton’s laws to appear to apply even on the purely descriptive level, exceptfor the local ether phenomenon which I will specify in further detail, whichinsures “force-free” perpetual motion, despite the gravitational effects of theether. While I agree with that part of Einstein’s theory that says gravity isnot due to the direct action of one object on another (no “force at adistance”), I disagree with the part that says it is due to the idea that alarge spinning body “wraps” space around itself and “curves it”. Without anether there is nothing to curve, and with it, there is no Relativity Theory and“no curved space” (as Tesla said).In early 1995, in exchange for a copy of Space Aliens From the Pentagon , Ireceived a copy of Eric Lerner’s The Big Bang Never Happened , and was pleasedto find that there are some in the academic world of physics (or astrophysics),who share at least in part, my own views on the 'Big Bang Theory', although theydon’t go so far as I do in saying the theory has been promoted by the coerciveenergy monopolists, along with Relativism, because of its apparent negation ofthe free energy available from the universe via the ether. This universal freeenergy is due to what I call the “Law of Conservation of Perpetual Motion”. Ifound Lerner’s book refreshing, not to mention useful in charting some of my ownif not Tesla's ideas on a more cosmic scale.Lerner’s relatively unsung hero is Hannes Alfvén, a Swedish astrophysicist andcosmologist, whose earlier “academic burial” by the Relativists was somewhatreversed in 1970 by a Nobel Prize awarded to him for his development of cosmicmagnetohydrodynamics and his concept of frozen lines of magnetic force, a theorylater modulated in part by him. Alfvén had in a way replaced the word “ether”with “plasma”, and strongly disagreed with the Relativist’s misuse ofmathematical theory, which he said ‘must always be the servant of physicalunderstanding and close observation, rather than its master’. He claimed thatgiant currents through space, from the sun through the planets, along frozenlines of force, actually transfer angular momentum to the planets. Thisdiscovery, together with his work on cosmic MHD events, places Alfvén’s workvery close to Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity.The appearance of such books as Lerner’s is a positive development, whichrepresents dissent which seems intolerable to the Relativists. The Big BangTheory is in decline among scientists, despite all the NASA false propaganda inthe press and mass media attempting to perpetuate and support this false theory.I recommend Lerner’s book, even though he has not yet evoked an affirmativesupport for ether theory, but has dared to challenge Relativism and the Big Bangcosmology.The actual course that a particular spot on earth takes through the universe isnaturally more complex than that of the sun, since the earth and the spot on itrepresents a smaller cycle within the larger. Relative to the background ether,the entire interrelated movements of the solar system and Milky Way takes ourspot in a generally wavy path, along which our velocity relative to externalbodies periodically accelerates and decelerates.The same principles of momentum which apply to the cosmos must also apply to themotion of immediately local bodies, except that the effects are skewered by thepresence of earth’s pesky electric, magnetic, and so-called “gravity” fields.What Alfvén had touched upon in his long-unrecognized discovery of the giantelectric and magnetic currents through space, are similar to unrecognized forcesoperative on a local scale as well. As our planet hurls through space at ca.70,000 mph, and us with it, there are things happening on a smaller, evenmicroscopic scale, which play important parts in this giant panorama.The big question—the one which those who promoted the Big Bang cosmology soughtprematurely to put to rest—is how can everything stay in perpetual motion, whileunder the Relativist theory the law of conservation of energy is violated—andthereby the Relativist theory also refuted? The still-born theories of Teslawere forever gnawing at the monopolists’ throats, along with those of Alfvén, sothey wanted to obscure all truly competing theories, and to enshrine theRelativists and Big Bangers in the annals of science for all time. Their methodwas to fabricate a scenario in which one original giant explosion was the‘origin’ from which all we see is but an effect which will eventually “run down”like a car which is out of gas. Thus they created and attached the entropytheory to the Second Law of Thermodynamics as if an integral part of it so thatenergy is constantly becoming “unavailable” as the universe runs down. And thatwould mean that the Second Law of Thermodynamics would violate the First Law ofThermodynamics.The missing ideas are how universal processes are continually self-replenished.Through an interplay of natural strong and weak forces acting with matter,perpetual motion is conserved. Strong forces overcome weaker forces and do morework in the same periods of time. Cosmic radiation travels through the ether,until it reacts with plasma, forming matter. When matter concentrates, forcesacting with it concentrate. In contact with other, less concentrated matter,stronger cosmic forces acting within the space it occupies are unleashed,producing transmutations and eventually more cosmic radiation, which travelsthrough space until absorbed and changed by plasma or other mass, producinglarger masses or other radiation, and the process continues, ad infinitum. Andall this reacting often with Tesla's Primary Solar Rays.The rigid thinker must have a simplistic answer as to “where matter comes from”,“where it is going”, “what is the purpose of life”, etc. Sometimes we mustaccept reality, and discard phony theories which attempt to give us a simplisticanswer for what we either must admit that we just don’t know, or should considersome questions too stupid to ask. The facts concerning the existence ofuniversal matter, forces, vast distances, massive bodies and events, andperpetual motion are irreducible primaries or “first laws” about reality, whichwe must accept before we can progress with answering particular questionsrelated to the more useful aspects of existence.Since the orbital speed of the earth around the sun is greater than the speed ofearth’s rotation, our spot never moves “backward” relative to the ether, thoughit slows down and speeds up. The orbital speed of the Milky Way is greater thanthe orbital speed of the solar system or rotational speed of the earth, and ourspot continues in a generally “wavy-wavy” path in which we accelerate anddecelerate over a one-day longer cycle, and so forth. There are still larger andlarger cycles of motion over time, as stated before. As can be seen from thesecyclical movements, the universe is a system of interrelated systems which movegenerally in gear-like precision, rather than in a more randomized explosivepattern ala the Big Bang. Universal movement is in an orderly, cyclical patternof circles (or ellipses), within circles, representing mechanical oscillationswhich are related to smaller and larger electromagnetic ones. The exceptions tothis—the occasional cosmic explosion, such as that of a supernova—proves ratherthan disproves the rule. Even the occasional comet follows a cyclical pattern,while the debris from cosmic events eventually falls into orderly patterns.Though such explosions on our scale are gigantic, they are like minor ripples ina pond on a cosmic scale, and should not be allowed to warp our perspective.Neither are the events in the entire universe governed by the profuse scribbleswritten by someone on a fly-infested dung heap in the Middle East a few thousandyears ago.If last week a remote controlled telescope—such as the Hubbell —showed amovement which when compared to an earlier measurement of a few years agoindicated a movement away from a distant part of the universe, just rememberthat this is only an observation of movement taken from one perspective at onetime of a much larger pattern of oscillations over a much longer period of time,in which the movement may later appear to be going the other way, from our pointof view or that of the telescope, if we could make an observation millions ofyears into the future. Because of the circuitous patterns of movements which weobserve in relation to earth at the present, and the larger structures in “ourvicinity” of the universe, we have good reason to believe that all suchmovements are cyclical, and to extrapolate ourselves into the time when theappearance would be quite different. The theory that the earth and othercelestial bodies are the result of the Big Bang are ludicrous. Just try toimagine the Big Bang explosion building the earth up from a small mass in space,to build thousands of feet of the detritus of living things, to increase themass of the earth through photosynthesis, which has nothing to do with a BigBang. What a coincidence! The universe has no “age”, as it has always existed,and always will. The whole theory about how planets “were created” from the BigBang is ridiculous.Life forms would not only have to have existed at one time on Mars, but on allother planets and stars, at some time. In fact, the planets grew from smallerbodies as a result of life forms, which convert interstellar ether into solidmass, driven by cosmic radiation. There is no depth to which we can drill onearth, or otherwise produce direct evidence to the contrary, where we will notfind matter which was in its past part of living things. This theory of coursemakes the planet “too old” for the Big Bangers, as it would take a much longertime for the earth to reach its present state, and would throw their“calendar”—called the “Hubbell Constant”, through which the high priests of theBig Bang have determined earth’s alleged “birth date”—off.For example, one of the components of chlorophyll is iron. This iron along withthe carbon deposits and other elements result from photosynthesis. If strata ofthe earth, thousands of feet—even miles —thick, are composed of the decayed andmetamorphosed remains of plant and animal life, the original biomass representsa conversion ultimately of ether, driven by radiation through photosynthesis,and into the many elements and minerals composing the strata, which can beeasily traced to this process, such as iron, calcium, phosphorus, sulfur,nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and helium. Such elements accumulate throughthe cosmically-driven forces of life forms. There is probably a constant ofuniversal mathematical proportionality between life forms and inorganic ones.And we should realize that all of this mass of the earth’s upper layers, down tothe deepest level we can drill, represents mass which has been added to earth’smass by life processes in which ultimately cosmic radiation drives theaccumulation of mass from the ether.The ether, the medium which supposedly conducts sound waves in the ether throughspace, can apparently be converted into any form of matter. Otherwise, wherewould that mass come from? It is also apparently possible to precipitate anyelement from the ether, or to transmute other elements, using proper technologywhich emulates or speeds up this natural process. The ether contains thebuilding blocks of what we call “solid matter”, the proof of which enhances thispossibility.Tesla eventually realized the ether’s use in his discovery of the “tremendouspropelling force”. His propulsion technology works and that is more importantthat splitting hairs...or atoms.Only an ether which is intimately involved with momentum, could explain such atremendous propulsion force such as that which I observed in 1953. Thispropulsive force was nothing more than a force which exists in nature, which inthe hands of man becomes an article of will, once the physical processes capableof synthesizing and manipulating it become known.Based on the assumption that I could see the ship for thirty miles, I estimatethat from the rate and manner of acceleration, in conjunction with the probablemass of the ship which I observed, it was immediately apparent that the entirevolume of the ship, if filled with conventional rocket or jet fuel, would havebeen consumed in the three seconds required for it to accelerate to ca. 36,000mph and disappear at the point of infinity. This was only possible because ofthe existence of Tesla’s technology which “electro-mechanically” canceledinertia and synthesized a new momentum almost instantaneously. This technologyalso created a friction-free pathway through the atmosphere and also prevented ashock wave or sonic boom, perhaps explainable by the fact that Tesla’s “soundwaves at the speed of light” are involved. Another explanation is thatrapidlyvarying negative electrostatic potentials apparently create a path ofmutually repulsive, same-sign negative charges in the atmosphere before, alongand behind the ship’s path which do not clap rapidly back together behind theship to create the sonic boom. I observed the atmospheric effects of thelingering charges scintillating and sizzling behind the ship, as they sloughoff.What is inertia? Inertia is the momentum which a body “at rest” alreadypossesses because it is in a state of uniform motion, but which to us appears tobe at rest. Tesla’s technology apparently uses the electrical attractive force,which produces 2 x 1039 power times more work, using a smaller amount of“gravitational” or chemical “input energy” to drive an electrical generator toproduce the electricity to trigger the change. If “energy” is the “ability to dowork”, and “work” is the “movement of a mass through a distance”, and a strongerforce will do more work over a given time period, a change in form of force froma weaker to a stronger force (which exists in the environment) will use“environmental energy” to do more work in a new way.The process which makes Tesla propulsion possible, is the dynamism of theuniverse, which naturally exchanges weaker and stronger forces to conserveperpetual motion, with any lost momentum being re-supplied by the Primary SolarRays or other natural cosmic radiation or forces. That seems the only way toexplain such a fantastic demonstration of technology in defiance to so-called“accepted theory”, but in accordance to Tesla’s hidden ones which the governmentpossesses in secrecy. Otherwise, why the secrecy?CHAPTER III: OBSERVATIONSWith Tesla’s theory and the background of older research and theories heldtemporarily in abeyance, let’s look at what has been directly observed either bymyself or by those closely associated with me.What I began observing in 1946, and have continued ever since, are man-madeelectro-mechanical flying machines which can hover, turn on a dime at high speedwithout flying apart, and accelerate almost instantaneously to at least 36,000mph, without readily audible sound or sonic boom. The ship I observed in 1953,in broad daylight, hovering at about 300 feet distance, about 250 feet aboveground level, precessed at a high angle—about 45 degrees—and a low rate of abouttwo cycles per second. Soon after I spotted it, it began to move away directlydue west, quickly accelerating to about 200 mph, at which time it did twoabsolutely square turns—a right angle turn straight down and another right angleturn about a hundred feet lower, back into level flight—then accelerated to apoint of infinity above the horizon about 30 miles away in three seconds. Thismaneuver to lower its elevation above ground by about a hundred feet appeared tobe designed to make the ship less visible to observers on the ground, when thepilot discovered that he was hovering over a town. The high angle of precessionappears in retrospect to have been a malfunction of the gyro-stabilizationsystem, as it would have otherwise have made it very difficult for a viewerinside the ship to make any sense out of what he could see outside.The ship was constructed as if it were two 50-foot diameter stainless steel woksjoined together clamshell fashion. It had concentric “striations”—grooves in itssurface which appeared to be about one inch wide all over its surface—which gaveits two halves the appearance of giant “spun-metal” woks, as it precessed withthe sun’s rays playing on its oscillating bright metallic surface. The sun wasabout ten degrees above the horizon at the time.As it precessed, the ship gave off a sparkling, “rainbow-colored” electricalcorona, like a metallic surface which was being electrified with high voltageTesla coils. On the shadow side of the bottom when it was periodically turnedaway from the sun during oscillations, there appeared a soft, ‘cloudy’,infra-red glow, which indicated the possible presence of microwaves on thebottom, while the general “rainbow” corona from the top was “brushy” andapparently of high voltage negative electrostatics. As the ship beganaccelerating, the rainbow corona formed a sparkling, scintillating trail behindthe ship, which also showed a “texture” across the trail which appeared tocoincide with the frequency of the precessions which increased in rate as theship accelerated, until a mere vibratory blur by the time the ship made its two90-degree turns at about 200 mph, which is a rough estimate. The ion trailgradually faded out behind the ship, with little sparkles appearing in the trailas it did so. The ionizations produced by this ship—rapidly-varyingelectrostatic ones produced by the one-quarter wavelength tuning of Tesla’ssingle terminal coil—apparently produced the sound waves which were projectedalong the direction of acceleration, and bringing in the tubes of forcenecessary for the propulsive force to act on the ship. All this theory wasapparent from the effects graphically illustrated by the corona together withthe actions of the ship.The ship had flown due west, toward the northern border of Ft. Bliss, near ElPaso, Texas. Ft. Bliss was the location of Headquarters, U. S. Army Ordinance,where Wernher von Braun was appointed research director in the summer of 1945.Von Braun’s main base of operation had been moved to Redstone Arsenal, Alabamaabout 1951.Consistent with the observed behavior, the electro-mechanical system appeared toinstantly synthesize in an internal atomic way, inertia and momentum, thingswhich normally create problems in acceleration and turning, but which the systemovercame as shown by the evidence of the square, right-angle turns and extremelyrapid acceleration. The system appeared to have very little to do with “gravity”in the textbook way, even though it did reveal that gravity itself is apparentlydue to the same kinds of electro-mechanics. These observations were taken atface value, as proof of certain facts concerning the nature of the ether,gravity, inertia, momentum, and electro-mechanical propulsion. It was also takenas proof of the fact that I saw a machine, that machines are man-made, and thatTesla had described his invention of a flying machine which had theseproperties.I had observed whole squadrons of saucers flying at high altitude in formationat night, beginning in 1946, and continuing in 1947 through 1953 at our nexthouse, during which time I slept outdoors in our back yard. The squadronsarrived over our town from the direction of New Mexico, the border of which wasabout ten miles north. The ships departed back to the north after theirnight-time maneuvers. Ergo, those particular ships were from a New Mexico base,which I took to be Holloman AFB at Alamogordo or White Sands Missile Range.The night squadron saucers turned in angles of 30 degrees or multiples (30, 60,90, 120, 180, etc.) which meant those particular multiples (30, 60, 90, 120,180, etc.) which meant those particular vintage Peiltochterkompass was used on.My observations, together with all the written information on thePeiltochterkompass, and an analysis of the device itself, revealed quite a lotabout the German “Kurskreisel Tochterkompass-p2\" and the propulsion system:1. The ships were electro-mechanically propelled;2. the propulsion system created an electric field around the saucers whichnecessitated the development of a celestial guidance system and compass, since amagnetic compass would be useless due to the “Faraday cage” effect;3. the ship was a circular, discus-shaped craft, which turned in 12 peripheraldirections (thirty degrees each) of the compass, plus “up” and “down”;4. the ships used a celestially oriented master navigational gyro(“Kurskreisel”), calibrated prior to take-off to the Pole Star, Arcturus, as theframe of reference with which to navigate the ship using an electromagneticslave compass (“Tochterkompass”), which was also interconnected to steppingswitches which actuated the ship’s bi-polar propulsion electrodes as the pilotwished;5. the system canceled the normal effects of gravity, inertia, and momentum, andinstantly synthesized momentum in the chosen direction, without disturbing theoperation of the master gyro, which continued to maintain its heading duringflights, apparently because of its ‘internal’ inertia/momentum within the ship’souter shell;6. the instant turns showed an incompressible ether which is integrally lockedwith mass in the phenomena of inertia, momentum, and gravity.The celestial orientation of the Kurskreisel to the Pole Star meant that nomatter where on earth the ship flew, true north would be correctly indicated. Ifa line is drawn from the Pole Star down through the center of the earth, this isthe axis around which the earth revolves. This master gyro had electricalcontacts around it’s gimbal so that as the ship was turned in the 30-degreeincrements, the contacts would relay that information to the slave compass sothat the small motor would come on and rotate the geared flight directionindicator ring until it showed the correct direction of flight in relation totrue north.Since the 1953 daylight sighting, I have seen many other electro-mechanicalcraft, but one of the best sightings I made was on a moonlit night while soakingin a hot tub.Rub-a-Dub-Dub, Seven Folks in a Hot TubOn a Wednesday evening, January 24, 1996, at approximately 7:00 PM, I sat in ahot tub with seven other people, at the Ten Thousand Waves Japanese Bath House,located on the western slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, in the HydePark vicinity above Santa Fe, New Mexico. As I steamed in the tub, conversationbetween a couple from Denver and myself drifted from the dangers of fluoride to“What do you do?”, to which I answered, “I write some”. Asked what I hadwritten, I answered “A book called Space Aliens From the Pentagon” .A beautiful woman on my right exclaimed “I have your book. I’m a friend of Alexand Rex. I love your book so much, and so do they.” I thanked her and weexchanged introductions, and then I said “I see saucers up here almost everytime I’m here after dark...and as a matter of fact, there’s one right there”(pointing out a flashing aircraft flying slowly easterly about 15 degrees to thelower left of the crescent moon, at a distance of about 10,000 feet from us).A heckler across the tub said “Aww, that’s a plane”, to which I responded,“There’s another one...and if they’re planes, why have they parked? (The shipshad become stationary in the air.) The flashing lights mask an underlying glow.The eye recoils from a flash, and never has time to recover before anotherflash. When they move faster, they glow brighter, which is why they are going soslowly.”No sooner had I spoken than the stationary ship on the left quit flashing, andturned into a much larger dark, glowing green shape like a football fieldsurrounded by a track. Around the “track” was a dark strip, with a purple coronaoutside that, produced by the Tesla coils. I could see the curvature of itsbottom as it moved, flying in a large circle, as I followed it with myoutstretched arm and index finger, and my fellow hot-tubbers oggled injaw-dropped amazement. The following is a black-and-white photo of a painting Idid of the saucer, as seen from the bottom. The ship is moving upward in theillustration, in the direction in which the electrostatic leaders are moving:[Image00008.gif]It returned to its starting point, stopped instantly and began flashing like asmall plane again. This took approximately ten seconds. Since the ship appearedabout three-quarters of an inch long at arm’s length (about 2 feet), at the10,000-foot distance, it was around 400 feet long and 250 feet wide. Since thediameter of the circle it flew in was about 30 degrees, its speed was about2,000 mph (the speed didn’t surprise me since I had clocked the one I saw in1953 over our back yard at a minimum of 36,000 mph when it departed; I had alsoclocked one on a radar scope at Keesler A.F.B., Mississippi in 1956 doing 4,000mph flying over Lake Ponchartrain).I almost missed this ship because I didn’t have my glasses, and because itappeared to have been “stealth-ized”—designed to be concealed by the dark nightsky, by controlling its emission color to be dark green, with the purple coronaalso being dark, so as to more closely match the light value of and blend intothe night sky. The main ‘give-away’ was the color differences.Others in the tub—most of whom didn’t need glasses—saw it more sharply than I,yet wouldn’t have seen it at all had I not pointed it out to them. I probablywould not have seen it myself had I not been observing as a habit, the flashingships beforehand, with the moon so close above, creating some back-lightingwhich helped to define the larger, darker silhouette when it arrived. Moreover,the real reason I saw it, was my own preconscious mental selfconditioning.I was amazed at its large size, since, when flashing, it appeared like a smallplane with beacon. When I finally looked back to the other side of the tub, theheckler was gone, the on-cue saucer demo being apparently too much for him. Ifthe saucer crew had been listening to my words, their performance couldn’t havebeen more perfectly timed. Bravo! Do they also have some computer software thatreads lips? It is my theory that the human saucer-jockies have chosen thatparticular location to do some “testing”, because of the titillatingavailability of the numerous private hot tubs open to the night sky, occupied byprivate nude couples of all sexual persuasions, easily video taped by them. Ican see them trading the tapes among themselves, another good reason to “...keepthe secret” to avoid prosecution for invasion of privacy and violation ofvoyeurism laws.It was the first time I had seen the green-glowing type reported years ago byastronomer Clyde Tombaugh, then recognized as the discoverer of the planetPluto. It was the second most graphic demonstration of the saucer technology Ihave witnessed. If I had not spotted it, it is probable that none of us wouldhave seen anything extraordinary, excluding the beautiful lady next to me wholiked my book, and was a strong competition to the saucers. Incidentally, thefemale breast shape may be “natures most nearly-perfect shape for a flyingsaucer design.” The “green-glowing” type was apparently the result of researchdesigned to make the ships less visible in the night sky, since the earlymodels—such as the “foo-fighters” (“Fliegende Schildkrote” [Flying Turtle] and“Kugelblitz” [Ball Lightening]) glowed brightly. The oblong design (asdistinguished from the circular or ‘peripheral’ saucers) comports with what Icall the “linear type”. According to a friend who is an expert spectrographer,the green corona indicated atomic absorption, which I presume to be ‘stealth’technology used to suppress the white light spectrum. He seemed to think sodiumbased coatings, while I think maybe chromium, because it appeared to be averidian (“chrome”) green. The soft, ‘cloudy’ green also indicated positivecorona, as distinguished from the ‘hairy’ negative (purple) corona around theouter periphery, and usually seen on Tesla coils.Comparison to Other SightingsThough remarkable, the hot tub sighting was not a clear, “daylight”,“close-range” sighting, like the first good sighting which I had personally madeon a bright, late summer afternoon in West Texas, in 1953, within 250-300 feet,right over our back yard, in Kermit, Texas, as our family and friends werehaving an ice cream party. I had been the last in my family and neighborhood tosee a saucer in a close-up daylight sighting, since three had appeared on twoconsecutive days, June 1st and 2nd, 1950, while I was unfortunately in the DavisMountains about 120 miles to the west. My father in his lifetime had seen morethan I had, and was once held in his car for 15-30 minutes, on the night of Nov.2, 1957, just south of Levelland, Texas, by one of the 200-foot-long ships,which had scared the livin’ daylights out of him. The thing hovered within tenfeet of his car top, killed his engine, and burned out all his lights, yetfailed to burn out a single fuse in any of the car’s circuits. The saucer’selectric field was apparently so strong that it arrested current flow, and wasstrong enough to cancel the magnetic fields in the generator and circuits. Thewhite-hot tungsten filaments of the bulbs were the weakest points in thecircuits, and the saucer’s pulse currents apparently subjected them to magneticand electric shear forces which broke them apart.My father had to drive back to Levelland in the dark, spend the night in amotel, then drive home to Odessa, Texas at dawn’s first light. He arrived homeabout 7:30 AM, had a quick breakfast, and left for Sewell Ford to have hislights fixed, saying nothing about the saucer. I turned on the TV for themorning news as he left, and realized that he had been one of the severaldrivers held by the ship (or ships) that night. I went to Sewell Ford andquestioned him about it as the mechanic fixed the lights, and he asked me how Iknew about the ship, and I told him it was on the news. He said he didn’t wantto be called “crazy”, so had remained silent. This was what I call“anti-paranoia”. It is sometimes reasonable to fear ridicule created by falsegovernment propaganda.Later, in 1963, I had the opportunity to discuss the matter more fully with thesheriff of Hockley County, while working in Brownfield, Texas. The ship seen bymy father matched in shape, appearance, and performance, the type observed bydeputy Lonnie Zamora, near Socorro, New Mexico. Zamora had at first describedthe crew of the ship he saw as typical G.I.s in gray-green Air Force flightsuits, but later altered his story, saying they were “...about the size ofchildren”. This was after the security spooks had ‘leaned’ on him.In 1993 to 1998, ships could be seen almost any night in the area where I livein New Mexico, and were very profuse in an even more obvious way around theCheyenne Mountain area to the south of Colorado Springs, Colorado, where theunderground NORAD complex is located. The prevalence of the ships near my homediminished rapidly after my books became more widely read, as this caused a lotof people to begin observing them.There has been another separate problem which I previously thought to beunrelated, the fact that I have been working on a book about ancient petroglyphsand have been blocked out of the San Cristóbal Ranch which I had free access tofor over sixteen years before it fell into the hands of Ronald Reagan’s blindtrust. The trustee was John Henry Singleton, who eventually bought the over81,000-acre ranch, which has some of the most important petroglyphs I know offor my research. The gluttonous ranch holdings for “Singleton Ranches” (thereare several in New Mexico and some in California) had apparently become thereceptacle for the large corporate income derived from military contracts by thetwo military-industrial complex corporations which Singleton was cocreator of,Teledyne and Raytheon. I had always believed that the reason I was blocked outof the ranch after the change in ownership was because of the archeologists, whohate my competing discoveries, and don’t want them published. I now know thatthe reason is additionally and especially due to my UFO research, made apparentafter I gave them a copy of Space Aliens From the Pentagon in 1994, after whichI was immediately and threateningly blocked out of the ranch. I am humiliated bythe shoddy and rude treatment and I have never encountered such inhospitablebehavior by land owners in the Southwest---who are usually dignified andhospitable---and maybe that is because these corporate, military-industrialcomplextype people from Los Angeles just don’t fit in here.In January, 2010, as I was watching TV in the dark at 2:00 A.M. because Icouldn’t sleep, I spotted a large discoid ship passing by through the largewindow above my TV on a downward path toward the ranch. Two minutes later I sawa second ship identical to the first one on the very same glide path toward theranch. In the following nights when I traveled down the highway going home fromSanta Fe I observed ships coming out of and going to the ranch. There is asaucer base over there. I should have figured this out before since Ratheon andTeledyne, and some of their many subsidiaries, manufacture components for UFOs.Their security there is way too high to be explained by mere “archaeologicaldigs”. They don’t want me over there because they fear I’d discover the base.And now I have.With the several direct observations or reports from those in my family or fromclose friends kept firmly in mind, let’s see what more can be found in ethertheory history to reflect on them.The Ether and “Ponderable Matter”In 1879, James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) said that the velocity of the solarsystem relative to the ether could be determined by observing the retardation ofthe eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites. The purportedly observed behavior—in whichthe light of a star can be viewed with a steady image as the earth moves throughspace— indicates a stationary ether relative to a moving earth, solar system,and other bodies. But according to Tesla, this idea was defective, since youcould not make such an observation on earth because the ether within earth’selectric field is carried along with the earth. You might be able to make suchan observation in outer space.The ether is ultra-fine and presumably composed of positive and negativeelectric matter, which pervades all so-called “free space” as well as space“occupied” by “mass”—which the old ether physicists called “ponderablematter”—even though mostly “space”. Since the ether is stationary near theearth, it is ‘ponderable matter’, at least where the ether is rigidified byearth’s rapidly-varying electrostatic potentials and electric field.The ether is transparent and does not refract or reflect light because of its“inconceivable tenuity” (Tesla said), although it is said to behave as a solidto light and heat. To “access” the ether in a propulsive way, rapidly-varyinghigh voltage electrostatic potentials are required, in accord with Tesla's soundwaves in the ether theory, first confirmed by the tests conducted by Tesla in1891 (later detailed in his 1891 lecture before the A.I.E.E., Columbia College,N.Y.). Tesla’s tests confirmed a reaction which was more than the feeble ionicreaction of light gases or so-called “electro-gravitics” such as those that themisinforming 1950s “patents” of T. Townsend Brown, later used in attempt toinduce the gullible public to believe was the correct technology. After histests, Tesla stated that the ether became a “solid state” medium which could beaccessed by subjecting it to electrostatic impulses of “sufficiently highvoltage and frequency”.The ether also becomes more apparent when there is a sudden change in thedirection of motion, rate of acceleration, or velocity of a body. The relativemovement of a charged body, equivalent to current, apparently creates a newdegree of electrical displacement of the ether through which it moves, andinfluences the resistance to changes in velocity through the affected ether bythe protons, neutrons and electrons composing the body itself. The increasedwork required to move such a charged sphere—the increased “resistance to change”called “inertia”—reflected by the increase in its tendency to remain in itscurrent state of motion (actually its current “momentum”), demonstrates that thechanges have created the resistance to movement of the sphere through the spacethrough which it moves. Therefore, once in relative motion at a constantvelocity—though more work was initially required due to the increased charges togive it that increased relative motion—the sphere’s momentum should be increasedconsistent to an increase in its “virtual mass”. This should make it clear thatboth inertia and momentum are caused by the same thing, which is a persistencein the reaction patterns in the atomic and electrostatic structure of the massto maintain its present state of motion due to its properties as they areaffected by the ether. Just as changing magnetic fields or electric fields arerequired for inductance, the creation of such changing electrostatic fields arethe basis for producing the sound waves in the ether for Tesla'selectro-mechanical momentum.All bodies are in motion, and within all bodies, protons, neutrons and electronsare always in motion, because “elasticity” and vibratory motion occurs in“ponderable matter” even when a body is at relative “rest”. The ether apparentlysets up certain patterns of motion in ponderable matter passing through it,relative to that motion, and changes in those patterns brought about byelectrostatic inductance can impart new motion to that matter, or inhibit itsmotion as shown by the charged sphere. It is clear that something in spaceaffects motion, otherwise it wouldn't be harder to move a charged sphere throughthe space so engendered.A body at relative rest on the earth sits within the ether rigidified by earth’srapidly-varying electrostatically-induced mechanical waves, and there is adown-force on that body called “gravity” created by the tubes of force beingpulled down. As a body on earth moves parallel to earth’s surface through theether within its electric field, rigidified by earth’s rapidly-varyingelectrostatic potentials (creating sound waves in the ether), it accumulatessome of these ether “tubes of force” commensurate to its motion, which gives itadded horizontal momentum.It is possible that the tubes of force, induced to flow into an earth-boundbody, can cause a downward thrust on the body’s atoms, away from thepre-existing “equilibrium position” (which the atoms would occupy in the absenceof earth’s electric field) which we call “gravity”. The equilibrium position forthe electrical particles of ponderable matter varies according to mass densityand displacement of the ether. A change in this electric displacement may resultin a new equilibrium position. The body always moves toward equilibrium. Thetime-relative aspect of the rate of acceleration of a falling body is apparentlydue to its relative accumulated and dissolved tubes of force as it falls,regardless of its mass density.In summary, inside an earth-bound body at relative rest there is a difference inether displacement effects from that which exists outside the body in freespace. Since earth’s electric field is vertically graduated through theintermediate space between the negative at earth’s surface and the positive atthe ionosphere, the electric properties of mass are subjected to graduatedstrains. The effect of electrical displacement and gravity vary accordingly,somewhat like Newton’s “inverse square” law. It is here that a differencebetween the “force of gravity” and the effects of inertia and momentum becomeapparent, since outside the earth’s electric field there is apparently nogravity.Traditionally, inertia has always been considered (according to Newton’s FirstLaw of Motion) the tendency of a body “at rest” (actually in “constant velocity”with earth) to continue its state of rest (or constant velocity), unless actedupon by an external force. Since all bodies at relative rest are already movingat the same “constant velocity” of the earth however, only changes in movementrelative to earth are at issue, and any such changes affect the patterns of flowwithin mass of the tubes of force, as the body moves through the rigidifiedether, at any given time. Since only a body which moves relative to the earthhas been traditionally said to have “momentum” (“the product of a body’s massand velocity”), this rule ignores the fact that all bodies “at rest” relative toearth already have “momentum” therefore “inertia”. And Tesla turned thesetheories upside down.Momentum and inertia are apparently due to the exact same “tendency”, whichrelates ultimately to a frame of reference to the universal ether, but forconvenience—since we don’t have an absolute “fix” on the ether—we use the movingearth as a frame of reference from which to measure a body’s rate of changerelative to the ether, as the earth maintains it relatively constant velocity.There is a special case on earth, because the ether within earth’s electricfield has been “conditioned”—that is, it has been subjected to electric strain.This comports with Tesla’s statement concerning the effects of “rapidly varyingelectrostatic forces” emanating from the earth.The earth has momentum within the sun’s frame of reference, just as a moving carhas momentum within the earth’s frame of reference. Some physicists havemistakenly applied a “gravitational field of influence” idea, thinking thissomehow isolates a body from references outside this field. I believe that thisis only an “apparent effect” and that earth’s “gravitational field” is a productof its moving electric field (a “current”) as it influences the ether within it,and that the so-called “gravity field” extends no further than earth’s electricfield.Momentum is due to the accumulation inside a body of the dissolving tubes offorce as the body passes through the ether, or in the case of UFO propulsion,the electro-mechanical inducement of the inward flow and dissolution of thetubes of force imparting mechanical momentum to the ship. The rotation of thesetubes of force is the product of the magnetic rotation of the plane ofpolarization first identified by Michael Faraday. Any variance from the earth’suniform motion results in a resistance to change in the orientation of the tubesof force, since the rotating tubes of force spin around their irrotational ethercores over a given time and a change in motion forces them to rotate around agreater or lesser quantity of ether depending on whether the change is anacceleration or deceleration. The tubes possess electro-mechanical force whichis at least 1040 power times stronger than the gravitational interaction (or 2 X1039 power times stronger than the so-called gravitational attractive force),which explains why these tiny tubes can have such a great influence over a massin motion. This force is locked into the discrete flow pattern between the etherand the tubes, which are coupled to the ‘ponderable matter’ structure which isthe recipient of the momentum.Though the flow patterns are always gradually changing because of the continualreorientation of the earth as it moves in its angular momentum around the sunand in its motion with and within the solar system, these changes are sensuallyimperceptible because they are so gradual over time, with effects which arevirtually constant. Though the changes are too slow to sense, the action of thetides are related to them as well as the electrical displacements caused by thepositions of the moon relative to earth.The natural gravity force is always normally toward the earth, which isnegatively charged, within earth’s electric/gravity field, due to the polarityof that field, since the negative component of the ether in free space iselectrically displaced upward by the repulsion of like charges. Meanwhile theinertial characteristics of positive mass is forced and attracted downward, andis more resistant to the changes in displacement.The movement of ether particles is related to the gravity force. Due to thegreater velocity of the electromagnetic interaction at C however, thisdown-force is irrespective to the direction of earth’s movement since theinteraction between the electrical components of matter and the ether due to theconditioning by the earth’s electric field, is vertically polarized. Thiscreates the same proximate effect on mass over time, irrespective as to earth’sorientation relative to the ether external to the earth’s electric field.Orbiting Planets and SatellitesThe concept that a satellite in orbit around earth is “held” in orbit by“earth’s field of gravity” seems false. The logical implication of my analysisis that the orbital path taken by a body is because it “sees” that path as oneof least resistance, as if it were a straight and level path. Since for a givenradius above earth the ether is displaced to a certain degree, an orbiting bodywould experience an accelerating force which would be met by inertia if it wereto move upward, and a decelerating force which would be met by momentum if itwere to move downward. Its path in force-free constant velocity remains at aconstant radius or level of ether displacement, as the path of least resistance.Since the determinate factor which limits a body’s motion is the reactance ofits internal electrical content with the ether at its particular degree ofdisplacement by earth’s electric field at a given altitude, an orbiting body“sees” its orbital path along a path of like displacement. This is contrasted tohow Einstein said that space and time are “wrapped” around a large spinning bodyas it moves through space because, without an ether, there would be nothing in“empty space” to wrap, and time cannot be wrapped because it doesn’t exist as anentity, being our human concept invented to measure the rate at which eventsoccur.One of the revealing facts obviated by films of astronauts floating in theso-called “gravity-free” space of an orbiting space station, is thecontradictory assertion that the space station is “held” in orbit by earth’sgravity. If earth’s gravity exerted sufficient force to hold the station inorbit, the internal environment would not be “gravity free”, but would pull theastronauts down to the floor, instead of allowing them to float all aroundinside, as we’ve seen so many times on TV. Yet, there is sufficient elasticitywithin the internal masses of the astronauts’ bodies, between electrical contentand the ether, to allow movement in that manner.If one calculates the phenomenon on a scale model of the earth one foot indiameter, the orbits of the astronauts would be only a tiny fraction of an inchabove the surface. For there to be “no gravity” at that “altitude” shows theridiculousness of the loss of gravity and refutes Newton’s inverse square law.But after all, Boscovich was the father of Relativism and Newton’s corpusculartheory of light was the basis for the eventual elimination of ether theory fromtextbook science.CHAPTER IV: HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE THEORYRotatory Motion and the “Screw Effect”Wm. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) asserted that magnetism possesses a “rotatory”character related to heat or the thermal motions of a body 17 . Nikola Teslamade many references to Wm. Thomson, pointing to his work as a prelude to hisown discoveries and17 17. Wm. Thomson, Proc. R.S. viii (1856), p. 150.applications which especially intensified in 1892. A review of the work of theworld’s major minds leading up to Tesla’s breakthrough is necessary to show justwhat Tesla discovered and what it meant in respect to ether physics and physicsin general. This is a task made more difficult by the concealment of Tesla’spapers by the U. S. government. And incredibly, the suppression of Tesla beganbefore the 20th century by the absence of references to Tesla or his work by the“Good Old Boys’ Club” in Europe.Around 1870, Thomson had conducted experiments which seemed to indicate that“gravitational action” could be induced by spheroidal bodies oscillated byelectrical currents or mechanical pulses18 . The surface pulsations could causeattractions or repulsions in respect to other bodies, as verified by Thomson.Tesla was aware of Thomson’s work during his student days in Graz, Austria,beginning in 1875 when he was nineteen. Thomson’s work undoubtedly served as aspark of inspiration for Tesla in his early conception of an “ideal flyingmachine” which would be propelled by electricity acting upon the ether. Thisexplains Tesla’s continual references to Thomson, such as demonstrating duringhis 1892 London lecture a ‘luminous wire’ sign powered by a Tesla coil, whichsaid “WILLIAM THOMSON”.At first, Thomson found that ponderomotive forces act between two solid bodiesimmersed in an incompressible fluid, when one of the bodies is immobilized andmade to oscillate with a force which acts along a line between its center andthat of a much larger sphere which is free. The free sphere was attracted to thesmaller (immobilized) sphere, if its density was greater than the fluid, while asphere of less density than the fluid was repelled or attracted, according tothe ratio of its distance to the vibrator in relation to a certain quantity.19Thomson’s experiments were analogical ones, for which he had evoked praise fromhis contemporaries even when he was still a teenager, although his refusal tobelieve anyone’s assertions unless he could build an analogical model to provethem often led to the consternation of his contemporaries, such as Maxwell, whorelied often on mathematical equations. The sphere experiments were designed touse mechanical and electrical wave methods to construct a model to probe thegravitational, inertial and momentum reactions of solid bodies in the ether.18 18. F. Guthrie, Phil. Mag. xli (1871), p. 405.19 19. Wm. Thomson, Phil. Mag. xli (1871), p. 405; Letter, Thomson to Guthrie,p. 427.The Faraday Effect—the rotation of the plane of polarization of radiation in adielectric medium (such as the atmosphere and certain solid materials) in amagnetic field—stated that the angle of rotation of radiation is proportional tothe magnetic field strength and the length of the path in the medium in thefield. These early experimenters also knew there was a connection between therotatory motion and momentum, and sought to find it.The rotatory (versus the linear) character of magnetic phenomena wasstrengthened by Thomson’s experimentally verified conclusions on the magneticrotation of light. This rotatory character not only influenced Tesla’s discoveryof the rotating magnetic field, but is also fundamental to inertia and momentum,as I will later explain, since movement of a charged body constitutes a currentwhich creates a magnetic field which creates the rotatory motion whichhypothetically may “bore” through momentum-carrying ether particles to createelectromechanical momentum.Thomson’s system was later investigated by C. A. Bjerknes between 1877 and 1910.Bjerknes showed that when two spheres immersed in an incompressible fluid werepulsated, they exerted a mutual attraction which obeyed Newton’s inverse squarelaw if the pulsations were in phase, while if the phases differed by a halfwave, the spheres repelled. At one quarter wave difference, there was no action.Where pulses were non-instantaneous at distances greater that a quarterwavelength, attractions and repulsions were reversed.20These conclusions were hypothetically related to possible propulsion. Thepublishing of these researches and experiments in the physical journals ofEurope were available to Nikola Tesla during his student days at the PolytechnicInstitute in Graz, Austria, and at the University of Prague, in Czechoslovakia.Tesla could read and understand all these pertinent journals in their originallanguages.Around 1878, George Francis FitzGerald (1851-1901) 21 compared magnetic forceand velocity in a quasi-elastic solid, based on a model devised earlier by JamesMacCullagh (1809-47)22 , whose model was the only one which could propagatewaves with the properties of light. This was obviously analogous to theelectromagnetic theory of light—as shown by MacCullagh’s ether equation ofmotion and ether theory which made it feasible to extend ether concepts torepresent optical phenomena, along with magnetic and electrical interaction.According to Tesla the electromagnetic theory of light was erroneous because theether is not a solid capable of transmitting transverse waves. To Tesla, lightis also sound waves in the ether and is mechanical and not electrical ormagnetic.20 20. C. A. Bjerknes, Repertorium d. Mathematik I (Leipzig, 1877) p. 268; Proc.Camb. Phil. Soc. iii (1879), p. 276; iv (1880), p. 29.21 21. George Francis FitzGerald, Phil. Trans. clxxi (1880), p. 691;FitzGerald’s ScientificAn Electrostatic Charge Carried AroundIn 1879, Edwin H. Hall23 , a student in Baltimore, repeated an experimentsuggested by H. A. Rowland, his professor, whose original experiment with agold-foil-covered ebonite disk in a magnetic field showed that electric chargeson a disk were carried around with it as it was rotated.24 In Hall’s experiment,a gold leaf strip in which a current was flowing, was placed into a magneticgap. This produced an electromotive force at right angles to the magnetic fieldand the current, which was proportional to the product of the two. Called the“Hall Effect”, it was already inherent in the three previous effects discoveredmuch earlier by Faraday.Faraday had discovered induction, by forcing a conductor through a magneticfield, cutting the lines of magnetic force and producing a current in theconductor, and also produced a magnetic field in an unmagnetized iron core, byforcing a current-carrying conductor through a gap between the poles of thecore. Faraday’s third effect was the generation of a current. Though Hall’seffect was inherent in the fact that it was the reverse of the force required byFaraday to push the conductor through a magnetic field, Hall’s work completedthe triad of effects, by experimental verification. This electromagneticprincipal applies to solids not to the ether in freeWritings, p. 45.22 22. James MacCullagh, Brit. Assoc. Rep., (1835).23 23. Edwin H. Hall, Amer. Jour. Math. ii (1879), p. 287.24 24. H. A. Rowland, Ann. d. Phys, clviii (1876), p. 487.space. This is the basis for MHD (Magneto-Hydrodynamic) generators, and isintegral to fluid propulsion.Since the galvanometer needle in Hall’s experiment was deflected only when themagnetic field arose or collapsed, the physical thrust created was a vectorproduct which had already been expressly suggested by Maxwell25 almost 15 yearsearlier (derived from Maxwell’s analysis relative to Faraday’s work of ca.1845), though Maxwell failed to follow up with experiment (because he died), butthe equations are still used.Though it was said by Whittaker that the Hall Effect, like the magnetic rotationof light, occurs only in ponderable bodies and not in the “free ether”, thisstatement is patently false since the effect actually depends on theconductivity of a medium. The fact that the effect occurs in ‘ponderable bodies’and ‘conductive media’ however, seems important for electro-mechanicalpropulsion, since it shows the reaction between such bodies and media and theunderlying “ether framework” which is accessed in the process.Since the “natural media” (the ether and the atmosphere) so often referred to byTesla in his patents become conductive under the influence of an electrostaticforce of sufficiently high voltage and frequency, the effects of electrostaticson the free ether, dependent upon proper conditions, can impart momentum to aponderable body, so as to move it though the free ether. A startling proof thatTesla's sound waves work in the free ether, was Tesla’s electro-mechanical platesuspensions in his laboratory in 1898.26 This was also verified by Tesla’stransmission of mechanical energy through space by longitudinal sound waveswhich travel at C, as explained in his 1892 Lecture before the Institute ofElectrical Engineers, London. This also showed Tesla’s priority with radiodiscovery.Since an electric field ‘displaces’ the ether—which is the basis for MHD pumping(especially when pulsed)—the effect actually showed an operable “electromotiveforce” (“emf”), or “electro-propulsive force”, between ponderable bodies and theether, by means of electro-mechanical action. But the high voltage and highfrequency are required to ‘access’ the ether. Tesla had succeeded intransmitting mechanical energy by means of high voltage, high frequencyelectrostatically-induced sound waves —“radio waves”—‘accessing’ the ether.Tesla’s work at that point had already verified experimentally everything thathe said and refuted what Maxwell had “mathematically” analyzed as being thesupposed “electromagnetic” nature of light ---Faraday’s theory---which is falsebecause the ether is not a solid but a gas.25 25. G. C. Maxwell, Treatise, (1862).26 26. F.B.I. Papers, (1943), disclosed through the Freedom Of Information, inthe statement of Marguerite Merrington. The FBI disclosure documents also showthat the contents of Tesla’s safe, two truckloads of papers and apparati, 75packing crates and trunks and another 80 large storage trunks were all removedand stored in the warehouse of the Custodian of Alien Properties in New York in1943.Though it was implied, the literature available to me failed to explicitly statethe idea that inertia and momentum are the products of an electrostatic forceacting on the ether which acts within bodies and all space. Neither was itspecified that a pulsating sphere or other ponderable body can be propelledthrough the ether, without the presence of another sphere or ponderable body topull against— except in the statements of Nikola Tesla and his “Flivver”electromechanical “ideal flying machine”.In 1884, the year Tesla invented the rotating magnetic field, J. J. Thomsonattempted to determine the field produced by a moving electrified sphere, andthe mathematical development of the theory accelerated. It was naturally easierto solve such problems from the known behaviors of simple geometricforms—planes, spheres, and cylinders.27The possibility that the ether was composed of positive charges carrying theirown ‘sub-quantum’ negative charges which were elastic and could be displaced hadapparently evaded the thinking of Thomson, who had discovered the electron, thecharge of which was considered indivisible. Although he had assumed thatdisplacement currents must occur in the ether, he had earlier thought this wasdue to the magnetic effects of moving charges, though he failed to show how thedisplacement currents occurred, or what their specific effects were in terms ofinertia and momentum, until after Tesla’s 1892 lecture in London, which heattended.There was already a sort of battle brewing between the proponents of classicalelectrodynamics and the proponents led by27 27. J. J. Thomson, Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. xv (1884), p. 197.Maxwell of an electromagnetic theory of light. To the former, conductivityoccurred in metal wires, etc., while with Maxwell, it occurred in thesurrounding dielectrics and ether-filled space, with the conductors serving onlyto “guide” the action. Tesla departed from the Faraday/Maxwell camp,particularly on some major points such as a solid versus a gaseous ether.Maxwell's work seems valid in terms of electromagnetic effects in solids.FitzGerald attempted to unify the two views by arguing that Maxwell’sunification was valid because radiation could be generated by purely electricalmeans. It is interesting to see how these researches contrasted with thedevelopment of the electro-mechanical propulsion of Tesla.Along this line, Wm. Thomson (1884) first considered a charged sphere movinguniformly in a straight line. He assumed that the electric charges wereuniformly distributed, with an electric field the same in all directions, nomatter what position the sphere was in, the same as if it were at rest. Thisassumption proved true so long as the velocity of the sphere and the velocity oflight were neglected.In 1889, Wm. Thomson stated28 , “Rotational vortex-cores must be discarded; andwe must have nothing but irrotational revolution and vacuous cores.” By this,Thomson meant that the vacuous “ether” inside rotating tubes of electromagnetismdid not rotate. Perhaps meaning that if the cores rotated along with therotating tubes of electromagnetic force, it would neutralize theelectromechanical action by which the tubes of force move.FitzGerald found a purported error in Thomson’s work, saying that the required“circuital condition” was not satisfied unless the moving charges on the spherewere considered as current, combined with the displacement and convectioncurrents due to the motion. In correcting Thomson’s error, FitzGerald wentoverboard in concluding that the magnetic force due to the displacement currentsof the moving sphere had no resultant effect.In 1888, Oliver Heaviside showed that the electrostatic units “vanished” to theinside of a moving sphere. This was the opposite to Faraday’s experiment inwhich electrostatic charges placed inside a stationary, closed vessel “appeared”on the outside. Apparently, movement of the sphere—which increased itsmomentum—appeared28 28. Wm. Thomson Proc. Roy. Irish Acad. i (30 Nov. 1889), p. 340.to force the charges back inside.Heaviside’s conception of the “spherical” symmetry of charges during movementwas disproved by G. C. F. Searle in 189629 . Searle found that a moving “pointcharge” system is not a sphere, but an oblate spheroid, with a polar axis alongits direction of motion. What Whittaker failed to point out was the importanceof this finding, a connection between inertia, momentum, current, surfacecharges “vanishing” and “reappearing”, and an electrical polarity along thedirection of momentum, as well as an electro-mechanical link between themovement and the ether, since the displacement of the electric lines andpolarity correspond to the movement, consistent to the thinking that the tubesof force deliver momentum to a body forced to move through the ether.During this time, Nikola Tesla had not tarried. He had already shown that the“circuitous condition” could be met in a totally new way. In his lecture beforethe A.I.E.E. at Columbia College, N. Y., may 20, 1891, he demonstrated hisyears-old technology, and stated that he connected “one terminal” to a lamp andthe other to “an insulated body of the required size. In all cases the insulatedbody serves to give off the energy into the surrounding space, and is equivalentto a return wire.” In this lecture, Tesla also spoke of his electro-mechanicalmomentum theory which was similar to J. J. Thomson’s discovery of 189330 , whichwas flawed.In the same year as Searle’s finding (1896), W. B. Morton31 similarly showedthat the surface density of a charged body is unaltered by motion, but the linesof force no longer leave the surface perpendicularly (like the ship I saw whilehot-tubbing). He also found that the energy of the surrounding field is greaterwhen in motion than when at rest. Since greater work is required to move acharged sphere, than an uncharged one, with no increase in the actual mass ofthe sphere, a connection between moving charges and an ether was verified. Thiswas considered true because the charges increase the “virtual mass” of thesphere, and the self-induction of convection currents is formed when the chargesare set in motion by movement of the sphere, but neither of these explanationsseemed to explicitly note that a force between a moving charged mass and thespace through which it moves must have an ether framework to push or pullagainst, or that a current is caused to flow between matter and the ether, (asin Tesla's “circuital condition”) due to the movement.29 29. G. C. F. Searle, Phil. Trans. clxxxvii (1896), p. 675.30 30. J. J. Thomson, Recent Researches in Elect. and Mag.,, (1893), p. 13(Supra.).31 31. W. B. Morton, Phil. Mag. xli (1896), p. 488.J. Larmor32 suggested that the inertia of ponderable matter may be ultimatelyproven to be of this nature, since atoms were constituted of systems ofelectrons. If a greater “virtual mass” effect (W. B. Morton, supra) is createdelectrically, which increases or decreases the ease of movement of a bodythrough the “free ether”, and increases the total energy of the moving system,then a link between ponderable bodies and the ether framework was proven. If theincreased charges opposed a body’s movement, then the system could be reversedto produce a thrust on the body. This suggested that a system of movement ofcharges into or through a sphere would propel it through ether-filled space.There were similar implications in the works of Faraday, Maxwell, Wm. Thomson,J. J. Thomson, MacCullagh, Morton, Searle, Heaviside, Hall, and FitzGerald, of asearch for a distinct relationship between momentum and the movement of chargesconnected to mass, through an interpenetrating “solid” ether, rather than thegaseous, dynamic, incompressible, ultra-fine ether of Tesla, existing in allspace and ponderable matter, upon which electromechanical ponderomotive forcesact. Once the equilibrium of the ether was “disturbed” by the moving charges,the ‘displacement’ could be rectified only by an equal and opposite reaction,which was the propulsion of the ship. Thomson had accepted the principle thatthe ether itself is the vehicle of mechanical momentum. The Hall effect hadshown that an electromotive thrust (at close range) is produced along a thirdaxis as a result of a current and magnetic field at right angles. Though Teslaalleged that this thrust could not be produced “in the free ether”, but only inponderable matter, the works of Heaviside, Searle, and Morton showed that themoving charges could either increase or decrease the normal ease of movement ofa body, which inferred the feasibility of Tesla's theory.32 32. J. Larmor, Phil. Trans. clxxxvi (1895), p. 697.Nikola Tesla’s 1938 retrospective statement33 , that he had his Dynamic Theoryof Gravity “all worked out” by 1894. Some available documentation of Tesla’swork of 1891 or earlier shows that he was already experimentally ahead of theEuropean field led by Wm. Thomson, J. J. Thomson, Searle, Morton, and Larmor—towhom he undoubtedly owed a debt. Though some of their statements were datedearlier, they lacked Tesla’s essential hardware to verify their theories, or acomplete valid theory.In 1915, Tesla stated34 that his (electro-mechanical) “...manless airship...”would travel “...300 miles a second...” (1.08 million mph), “...withoutpropelling engine or wings, sent by electricity to any desired point on theglobe...”.In 1940, Tesla stated35 that he had already tested his four-part Teleforcesystem, which included “...a new method for producing a tremendous propellingforce...”, as used on his flying machine, in case anyone noticed.CHAPTER V: TESLA AND THE GOOD OLD BOYS’ CLUBWhen Tesla popped into the picture, the British “Good Old Boys’ Club” had beendebating ether theory for quite some time, and the upstart Tesla must have hurtthe pride of their linemen, by making an end run to make a touchdown. After his1892 lectures in London, they said nothing about him in their journals, nevermentioned him. But he had showed them his hardware and how it worked. So theydid mention “Tesla coils” and nothing else.In 1847, Wm. Thomson, in discussing the motion of a magnetizable body in anon-uniform field of force, said a charged body attracts a body having a greaterspecific inductive capacity than that of the surrounding medium, and repels abody with a lower specific inductive capacitance, to afford the path of bestconductance to the lines of force.Thomson had also stated that an electrode immersed in a fluid insulating medium(apparently an analogy to a body in ether-filled space), at “...sufficientlyhigh frequency”, would cause a gravitation of gases all around toward theelectrode, but that the general opinion (of he and his European colleagues) wasthat it was “out of the question” that such frequencies could be reached. Whilethis was theory on Thomson’s part, Tesla had already done the experiment. AndThomson’s last opinion regarding frequency was soon to be disproved by Tesla, aclose follower and admirer of Thomson’s work.33 33. Nikola Tesla, Lecture before the Institute of Immigrant Welfare (May 12,1938).34 34. Tesla Article, New York Times, (Dec. 8, 1915).35 35. Wm. L. Laurence, New York Times article (Sept. 22, 1940).In reiteration, the other Thomson—J. J. Thomson—had claimed to havemathematically developed the theory of moving tubes of force36 . In his RecentResearches in Electricity and Magnetism , his hypothesis was that “...the aetheris a storehouse of mechanical momentum,” as stated earlier in this book.Tesla’s lecture before the A.I.E.E., Columbia College in 1891 was based onearlier experiments. He mentioned the “tubes of force” and disclosed some of hisdiscoveries concerning the ether and momentum. His Feb. 1892 lecture37 in Londonwas made at a time when the Good Old Boys were still debating whether anelectromagnetic action could occur in the free ether, at which time Teslaexplained that he planned to run motors at a distance by wireless energy, withequipment he had already built, and to extract free energy from the environment.They must have been paralyzed by miscomprehension.Four years later, Wm. Thomson stated38 his “inclination to speculate” that“alterations of electrostatic force due to rapidly changing electrification” arepropagated by “...condensational waves in the luminiferous aether.” Thisstatement seemed to indicate that Thomson was just beginning to take Teslaseriously. By “condensational waves” he apparently meant Tesla’s mechanicalpressure waves.In his 1892 London lecture before the Good Old Boys at the Royal Academy, Teslahad stated that the ‘required’ frequencies— which Thomson had said were “out ofthe question” to be produced —were “...much lower than one is apt to estimate atfirst”, and continued (in pertinent part, emphasis mine): “ We may cause themolecules of the gas to collide by the use of alternate electric impulses ofhigh frequency, and so we may imitate the process of a flame; and fromexperiments with high frequencies which we are now able to obtain, I think theresult is producible with impulses which are transmissible through a conductor.”“...it appeared to me of great interest to demonstrate the rigidity of a gaseouscolumn”...“with such low frequencies as, say 10,000 per second which I was ableto obtain without difficulty from a specially constructed alternator.” “...howmust a gaseous medium behave under the influence of enormous electrostaticstresses which may be active in the interstellar space, and which may alternatewith inconceivable rapidity?”36 36. J. J. Thomson, Supra.37 37 Nikola Tesla, Lecture before the Institute of Electrical Engineers, London(Feb., 1892).38 38 Bottomley, Nature liii (1896), p. 268.Tesla was already talking about outer space. In this respect, Tesla seemed alsoto address his Primary Solar Rays. His statements also show he was attempting tomake up his mind as to the characteristics of the ether, such as its rigid orfluidic states, and under what circumstances it may change, and its static ordynamic nature, of high or low density, and so forth: “What determines therigidity of a body? It must be the speed and amount of moving matter. In a gasthe speed may be considerable, but the density is exceedingly small, in a liquidthe speed would be likely to be small, though the density may be considerable;and in both cases, the inertia resistance asserts itself. A body might move withmore or less freedom through the vibrating mass, but as a whole it would berigid.”This statement reflects Tesla’s earlier tests, as stated (emphasis mine) in his1891 lecture before the A.I.E.E. at Columbia College in New York, repeatedduring his 1892 lectures in London, “...he illustrated how mechanical motionsare produced by a varying electrostatic force acting through a gaseous medium”.The tubes of force were said to be “...formed of rows of moving directedmolecules” (in this sense, Tesla was referring to “ether molecules”). Teslalooked upon “...all electrostatic, current and magnetic phenomena as being dueto electrostatic molecular forces.” This statement clarified what Tesla meant by“molecules”, and this is where Tesla parted ways with J. J. Thomson, whoconsidered these phenomena to be of a purely electromagnetic nature, while Teslaregarded electrostatic phenomena to be more important.3939 39 Nikola Tesla, Lecture before the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia (Feb.,1893); Lecture beforeThese lectures addressed how “solid bodies” can pass through a vibrating,incompressible mass of ether which, as a whole, is rigid. This is the essence ofhow the “inertia resistance” of the underlying ether framework can be summonedup by an electrified body which activates and rigidifies the ether withelectrostatic impulses of “sufficiently high voltage and frequency”. As theinertia resistance of the ether “asserts itself” the electrified body can bepropelled through the ether.Tesla’s “specially constructed alternator” was in one embodiment a 32-inchdiameter one, which, if similar to the type used on the saucer I saw in 1953,was probably driven by one of Tesla’s bladeless turbines. In the 1890s, Teslasaid the alternator had produced up to 10 amps and 30 kilocycles, like the onebelow:[Image00009.gif]The saucer which I saw in 1953 exhibited precessional characteristics whichcould have been caused by the use of such an alternator, the output and rpms ofwhich under the circumstances could have been varied with the power level of thesaucer. The high angle and low frequency of the precessions would be consistentwith the use of a large diameter alternator, which was turned more slowly athovering power, and increased in rpm for more power as the ship accelerated.Since the alternator would have been attached to the airframe of the saucer, itcould have caused the entire saucer to precess at a high angle and low frequencyat low rpms. But this appeared to be a malfunction or perhaps a defect in thesaucer at that time which hadthe National Electric Light Association, St. Louis (March, 1893).not yet been corrected. A “double plate” gyrostabilizer idea which I mention inthe following “bare-bones” saucer design would probably have corrected thisproblem, unless it was due to a turbine problem, with the turbine turning tooslowly to maintain correct stability. On the other hand, the problem could havebeen caused by a malfunction of the main gyrostabilizer system in which case therotating alternator’s precessional characteristics predominated. This situationis shown in the last illustration in this book, the saucer which I saw in 1953.The balanced forces holding the ship in mid-air would have been equivalent toholding it on “gimbals of air”, so that it could have been precessing freelyaccording to the speed of the rotating alternator’s angular momentum and mass.This would have required very little force if the main gyro-stabilizer wasmalfunctioning, but points up the need for the better gyro-stabilization systemwhich Tesla emphasized in his 1912-14 statements.Tesla had anticipated the problem of how to counteract the tendency of hisVTOL-type ship to rotate due to the torque of the propeller, alternator orturbine, by using two turbines or alternators, turning on parallel axes in thesame direction or counter-rotated, as stated in his patent #1,655,114, Apparatusfor Aerial Transportation, Jan. 3, 1928. In the case of a saucer howevertwo-axis gyrostabilization is necessary to stabilize the ship, one on horizontalaxis to stop the spin of the ship, the other on vertical axis to keep the shipupright. And then a special gyro-stabilizer would be required to stop the wildgyrating of the ship caused by the alternator. But despite any possiblemalfunction of the main gyro-stabilizer, the high angle precession problem wassolved when the alternator was spun up to high rpms as the ship departed. Itjust seemed such a big problem for the pilot and crew if they were trying to seewhere they were. I think by the way the ship made the two 90-degree turns to goabout a hundred feet lower in altitude showed that they suddenly realized thatthey were over a town and wanted to diminish the visibility of the ship by thepublic by those maneuvers.As the ship accelerated to full speed and power, its low precessional rate andhigh precessional angle became a mere highfrequency vibration, as the ship shotto infinity in three seconds (as I counted them off, “...thousand and one,thousand and two, thousand and three...”). My calculation of the speed was basedon my being able to see the ship for thirty miles. (I had previouslymiscalculated the speed by assuming that I could only see the ship for 7.5miles, but I see aircraft coming over the Sandia Mountains thirty miles away allthe time so this was wrong.) Since the ship covered ca. 30 miles in threeseconds it was doing ca. 36,000 mph.As the precession of the ship became the high-frequency vibration, this tendedto blur the appearance of its edges, something which has probably made it moredifficult to obtain sharp definitions of the profiles of saucers in photographsand videos. Coupled with this physical vibration may be the “Faraday effect”—the“magnetooptical effect” which tends to blur the outlines of objects subjected tointense electrostatic fields. The extension of the ship’s electric field alsoextends its magnetic field, and causes a rotation of the optical plane, so inaddition to visual effects of the high frequency precessional oscillations, theoptical plane is actually rotated to create the weird magneto-optical effects sooften reported, and becomes distorted in the minds of mystics, who think it issome sort of “time travel” or “inter-dimensional travel” effect, a“spacewarping” or “wrapping around” of “time and space” by a “rotating body” asit moved through space ala Einstein, except saucers don’t “revolve”, as provenby my Peiltochterkompass and visual observations, and Einstein was full ofbaloney, as Tesla said.The flying saucer may be powered by a Tesla alternator, powering a Tesla coil,with improvements which have probably come along in the meanwhile. The requiredcurrents could be conveyed through conductors by means of high voltage steppingswitches or relays, to several coils facilitating the instantaneous control of aship. Since an on-board power generator is usually required—unless the wirelessTesla transmission of power is used—the use of an alternator is convenient torun a spark gap, coil and condenser combination, since the necessary highfrequency alternations can be easily stepped up to higher voltages by severalclosely linked “extra” coils distributed about the ship. That would make iteasier to pipe medium high voltage current around to several coils as needed.The more modern development of very high K-factor dielectrics now makes itpossible to more easily handle very high voltages and currents and greatlyreduce the size of components, so that a high-output coil of several millionvolts can be made only a few inches in diameter, for example.The master gyro-stabilizer for German ships, according to undocumented rumorsfrom Germany, was purportedly constructed of two counter-rotating steel plateswith pinion reversing gears between to create equal and opposite rotation. Theprecession and torque of one plate would cancel the precession and torque of theother plate to create the stability that Tesla sought, and may have been the“special” device which he referred to in 1914 in addition to the turbine, reliedon for gyro-stability. For the high altitude flights that I observed in 1946-47,a pressurized cockpit would be required. Below is my illustration of the basic“bare bones” man-made UFO:[Image00010.gif] TESLA’S DYNAMIC THEORY OF GRAVITYAccording to Tesla’s 1938 Lecture before the Board of Immigrant Welfare40 , hisDynamic Theory of Gravity was one of two far reaching discoveries which he“...worked out in all details” in the years 1893 and 1894. Tesla never publishedhis complete theory and40 40 Nikola Tesla (supra).the government now possesses all the papers related to it. The 1938 lecture wasless than five years before his death.More complete statements concerning these discoveries can only be gleaned fromscattered and sparse sources, because the papers of Tesla are concealed ingovernment vaults for “national security” reasons since 1945. When Ispecifically asked for these papers at the “National Security ResearchCenter”—now the “Robert J. Oppenheimer Research Center”—at Los Alamos NationalLaboratory in 1979, though they admitted having the papers, I was denied accessbecause they were classified and I didn’t have a “badge” (clearance), and eventhough on that same day, I discovered the plans for the hydrogen bomb on an openshelf, and told a Harvard graduate student about it later in the day at a SantaFe restaurant. The student went to Los Alamos, copied the plans and wrote anexposé at Harvard. I asked myself, “What could be in Tesla’s papers in 1943which is more secret than hydrogen bomb plans?” Of course I already knew theanswer.In his 1938 lecture, Tesla said that he was progressing with work on his DynamicTheory of Gravity, and hoped to “...give it to the world” as soon as he hadcompleted his secret developments.The “two great discoveries” to which Tesla referred were:1. The Dynamic Theory of Gravity - which assumed a field of force which accountsfor the motions of bodies in space; assumption of this field of force dispenseswith the concept of space curvature ala Einstein; the ether has an indispensablefunction in the phenomena (of universal gravity, inertia, momentum, and themovement of heavenly bodies, as well as all atomic and molecular matter); and,2. Environmental Energy - the discovery of a new physical Truth: There is noenergy in matter other than that received from the environment.In the usual Tesla birthday announcement—on his 79th birthday (1935)—Tesla madea brief reference to the theory saying it applies to molecules and atoms as wellas to the largest heavenly bodies, and to “...all matter in the universe in anyphase of its existence from its very formation to its ultimate disintegration.”Those imbued with relativist theory often refer to “pure energy” in some “form”,but there is no such thing, since “energy” is an abstract “ability” which has nophysical form as an entity unto itself. Who’s to say what “form” is “pure” andwhat form is not?My favorite philosopher, Ayn Rand, said “...In reality, there are nocontradictions. Things are what they are irrespective as to whether we know itor not. Check your premises.” If the term “energy” is only a convenientabstraction, then it does not exist in physical form, and really describes aprocess, the potential to perform work as a by-product of matter andelectromagnetic radiation in perpetual motion, some of the force of which hasbeen diverted through a path where it performs the desired work, as it goes onits way though the universe. Every change of form of form, matter or radiationinvolves the “work” which induces the change, or the “work” which is induced bythe change. Without work there is no change, but all work is ultimately theproduct of the universe in perpetual, self-sustaining motion, as a rule and notan exception.As for Tesla’s theory, we have hints, such as, that the earth is the “star ofhuman birth.” In poetic expressions, he referred to scientific meanings instatements such as, that by using the “thunderbolt of Jove” (the Indo-Europeansky god), man “annihilates time and space”, an allusion to the use ofelectrostatics (“thunderbolts”) to travel so fast, that time and space are“annihilated”. Where the government has stolen his papers, we must search formeaning elsewhere. In an article41 , Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory ofGravity in poetic form (as paraphrased by me):1. That the luminiferous ether fills all space;2. That the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force;3. That the ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed oflight, becoming ponderable matter;4. That when the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether(similar to “atomic decay”, only non-relativistic)41 41. John J. O’Neill, Prodigal Genius (1944) pp. 251-52, referring to theTesla article Man’s Greatest Achievement .5. That man can harness these processes, to:-Precipitate matter from the ether-Create whatever he wants with the matter and energy derived-Alter the earth’s size-Control earth’s seasons (weather control)-Guide earth’s path through the Universe, like a space ship-Cause the collisions of planets to produce new suns and stars,heat, and light-Originate and develop life in infinite formsTesla was referring to unlimited energy, derived from the environment. Severalof his major free energy discoveries have been the exclusive stolen property ofour Secret Government. The conversion of a weaker force to a strongerforce—electro-mechanical propulsion—used to control the much weaker gravityforce, would accomplish more work in the same amount of time, and thereforeproduce “over unity” results.Some of Tesla’s unusual conceptualization of the ether had been nonethelessexpounded piecemeal, in his preceding 1890s lectures.42 He later railed againstthe limited and erroneous theories of Maxwell, Hertz, Lorentz and Einstein.Tesla believed that the ether is composed of “independent carriers immersed inan insulating fluid”. A “carrier” is a conductor. The ether therefor is aconductor. It is unclear whether Tesla meant that the “insulative fluid” inwhich the conductive ether is immersed is the ether's own insulative fluid orthe air, which Tesla often referred to as an insulator. When Tesla spoke of “themedium”, he meant the ether, as stated here (emphasis mine): “...But the upperstrata of the air are conducting, and so, perhaps, is the medium in free spacebeyond the atmosphere, and these may contain an opposite charge.” (Nikola Tesla,High Frequency and High Potential Currents , Chapter XXVIII, The Philadelphiaand St. Louis Lecture. On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena, February andMarch, 1893). We know today that the ionosphere is positively charged and thatit is conductive. Meanwhile, Tesla said the ether in outer space may have anegative charge, and is also probably conductive.42 42. T. C. Martin, Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nicola Tesla,(1894), Chapter XXV Introduction - The Scope of the Tesla Lectures .Tesla’s ether was neither the “tenuous” ether with the “solidity of the hardeststeel” of Maxwell and Hertz, nor the half-hearted, gaseous ether of Lorentz.Though Tesla’s ether was gaseous it consisted of “...carriers immersed in aninsulating fluid”, which filled all space, with properties which variedaccording to relative movement, the presence of mass, and the electric andmagnetic conditions it is subjected to. It’s incompressibility and otherqualities meant it could be used to produce motion of ponderable bodies.Tesla’s ether was rigidified by rapidly-varying electrostatic force, and wasthereby involved in gravitational effects, inertia, and momentum, especially inthe space near earth, since, as explained by Tesla, the earth is “...like acharged metal ball moving through space”, which creates enormous,rapidly-varying electrostatic forces which diminish in intensity with the squareof the distance from earth, just like gravity. Since the direction ofpropagation radiates from the earth, the so-called force of gravity is towardthe earth, and this apparently also applied to all other bodies in space underthe theory.Tesla commenced to complete his theory at the same approximate period of timethat many of his experimental results and observations had been revealed in thethree lectures, often illustrated with demonstrations using Tesla-inventedequipment, as revealed in the following eight excerpts (the statements in quotesare Tesla's actual documented words) in pertinent part (emphasis mine):1. “The most probable medium filling the space is one consisting of independentcarriers immersed in an insulating fluid.”2. “In his experiments he dwells first on some phenomena produced byelectrostatic force, which he considers in the light of modern theories to bethe most important force in nature for us to investigate.”3. “He illustrates how mechanical motions are produced by a varyingelectrostatic force acting through a gaseous medium.”4. “One of the most interesting results arrived at in pursuing theseexperiments, is the demonstration of the fact that a gaseous medium upon whichvibrations are impressed by rapid changes of electrostatic potential, is rigid.”5. “If through this medium enormous electrostatic stresses are assumed to act,which vary rapidly in intensity, it would allow the motion of a body through it,yet it would be rigid and elastic, although the fluid itself might be devoid ofthese properties.” 6. “...on the assumption that the independent carriers are ofany configuration such that the fluid resistance to motion in one direction isgreater than in another, a stress of that nature would cause the carriers toarrange themselves in groups, since they would turn to each other their sides ofthe greatest electrical density, in which position the fluid resistance toapproach would be smaller than to receding.”7. “If in a medium of the above characteristics a brush would be formed by asteady potential, an exchange of the carriers would go on continuously, andthere would be less carriers per unit volume in the brush than in the space atsome distance from the electrode, this corresponding to rarefaction.”8. “If the potentials were rapidly changing, the result would be very different;the higher the frequency of the pulses, the slower would be the exchange ofcarriers; finally, the motion of translation through measurable space wouldcease and, with a sufficiently high frequency and intensity of the stress, thecarriers would be drawn towards the electrode, and compression would result.”In 5. above, Tesla states that an assumption exists that enormous,rapidly-varying electrostatic stresses exist in the natural environment,whichrigidify the ether , yet allow the motion of a body through it. In 6., heassumes that the carriers can be induced to cause motion of a body in onedirection. In 7., he mentions that a steady D.C. potential brush will cause acontinuous rarefaction of the ether carriers in one direction to induce thepulling motion via the “veritable ropes of air” which Tesla mentioned in 1914.And in 8., he gives the conditions for compression by high frequency potentialswhich will stop the carriers from passing through the solid body, so as to forcethe tubes of force from the opposite direction to dissolve in the body andimpart momentum.The eight excerpts are further reducible to the following four statementspertinent to his electro-mechanical propulsion technology:1. Mechanical motions of solid bodies can be produced by varying electrostaticforce acting through a gaseous medium (ether), which thereby becomes rigidified,yet allows solid bodies to pass through.2. Under influence of stress in one direction, the carriers may group together,forming tubes of force, creating greater ease of movement in that direction.3. When a D.C. brush is created by a steady potential in one direction, acontinuous exchange of carriers is created corresponding to ether rarefaction,as the tubes of force are drawn into the conductor.4. With a sufficiently high frequency (higher that that creating the brushdischarges) and intensity of stress in the opposite direction, carrier exchangeis blocked by ether compression, forcing the tubes of force entering theconductors of the ship from the opposite direction to dissolve and impartmechanical momentum.The system, using the two kinds of potentials (D.C. and A.C.) is known as “p2”,according to Tesla’s (and that of the Germans under von Braun’s direction)1936-38 UFO project by that name at Los Alamos, New Mexico. My friend Peter vanDresser was the first person to tell me of von Braun’s pre-war stay in NewMexico. Peter was distressed to the end of his life by the fact that, while hehad invented the first successful liquid-fueled rocket engine, Dr. RobertGoddard had not only misappropriated Peter’s invention, but had given it over tovon Braun during his two-year stay in New Mexico. Peter considered Goddard atraitor and invention thief for this reason. Prior to Peter’s invention, all therockets of von Braun and Goddard exploded at an altitude of around 5,000-6,000feet because the combustion chamber overheated. Peter wrapped the fuel linesaround the chamber, cooling it and vaporizing the fuel for greater efficiency,making continuously extended flights possible.In reiteration, the steady D.C. Electrostatic potential of the brush creates therequired exchange of carriers, ‘rarefying’ (stretching) the elastic, rigidifiedmedium (composed of ether carriers in an insulating fluid) in advance of theship, as the higher frequency A.C. to the rear compresses them, blockingexchange in that direction, dissolving the tubes of force from the oppositedirection and creating instant momentum, normal to the surface.In 1884, John Henry Poynting’s theorem had been that the flux of energy at anyplace is represented by the vector product of the electric and magnetic forces,multiplied by C/4π.43 This implied that forces in a conductor could betransformed there into other forms (such as the transformation in the conductorsof the tubes of force into momentum). In 1893, J. J. Thomson stated practicallythe same thing, saying “...the aether is itself the vehicle of mechanicalmomentum, of amount (1/4πC) (D B) per unit volume.44(Using e.-s. Units for D and EAnd e.-m. Units for B and H.)E = electrical forceD = electrical displacementH = magnetic forceB = magnetic inductionHeinrich Hertz’s theory45 was that two systems of varying current should exert aponderomotive force on each other due to the variations. Tesla’s disagreementwas apparently based on the fact that he proved that the “ponderomotive force”is due not to mere “varying currents”, but to rarefaction and compression of theether carriers, respectively, produced by different kinds of currents (D.C.,rapidly varying electrostatic and A.C.) Moreover, Tesla's method for accessingthe mechanical momentum of the ether was from a completely different and simplerperspective, the creation of (longitudinal) sound waves in the ether in thedirection of desired propulsion. This also appears to be the method which allowsthe ships to eliminate drag and sonic booms.43 43. John Henry Poynting, Phil. Trans. clxxv (1884), p. 343.44 44. J. J.

Thomson46 had extensively developed the theory of the moving tubes offorce, both magnetic and electric, saying that the magnetic effect was asecondary one created by the movement of electric tubes, and assumed:➔ That tubes exist everywhere in space, either in closed circuits or terminatingon atoms;➔ that electric force becomes perceivable only when electric tubes have agreater tendency to lie in one direction;➔ that in a steady magnetic field, positive and negative tubes may move inopposite directions with equal velocity;➔ that a beam of light is a group of electric tubes moving at C at right anglesto their length.Tesla later said his “dirigible torpedo” (“steerable” torpedo) would fly at amaximum 300 miles per second, perhaps since its forward velocity would be somediscreet fraction of C. Thomson’s 1893 publishing on this subject followedTesla’s 1891 lectures before Franklin Institute and Columbia College in America,and his lecture before the Royal Society in London, and appeared to shed lighton Tesla’s work, stating:➔ That a ponderomotive force is exerted on a conductor carrying electriccurrent, consisting of a transfer of mechanical momentum from the agent whichexerts the force to the body which experiences it;➔ that, if moving tubes entering a conductor are dissolved in it, mechanicalmomentum is given to the conductor;➔ that such momentum must be at right angles to the tube and to the magneticinduction;➔ that momentum stored in a unit volume of the field is proportional to thevector product of electric and magnetic vectors.Thomson’s Electromagnetic Momentum hypothesis was later developed by H.Poincaré47 and by M. Abraham48 .46 46. J. J. Thomson (supra).47 47. H. Poincaré, Archives Né erl. (2) v (1900), p. 252.48 48. M. Abraham, Gött., Nach., (1902), p. 20.But we can see a distinct difference between Tesla's and Thomson's theories inthat Tesla said nothing about the electric and magnetic fields, relying solelyon the effects of the combination of a rapidly-varying electrostatic D.C.(rarefying) potential and a higher frequency rapidly-varying electrostatic A.C.(compressing) potential, both produced by a Tesla coil with different tuning.By 1910, it was said49 (by Sir. Edmund Whittaker) that the consequences of thesepronouncements left three alternatives:(1) Modify the theory to reduce to zero the resultant force on an element offree aether (as with Maxwell, Hertz, and Einstein);(2) assume the force sets aether in motion (as with Helmholtz);(3) accept the principle that aether is the vehicle of mechanical ·momentum ofamount [D B] per unit volume (as with Poynting and J. J. Thomson).Whittaker’s greatest error was in omitting mentioning Tesla's theory entirely,even though Tesla’s experiments had verified it, in front of the esteemedmembers of the “Royal Academy”. It seems highly improbable that they simplyfailed to comprehend Tesla. Tesla however said he had not “completely” workedout his Dynamic Theory of Gravity until 1893 and 1894, but never published it,so how could it be discussed? In reality, the “three (later) alternatives” weremoot, and a new law existed, that of Tesla. So we see that the suppression ofTesla’s theory was partially a conspiracy and partially his own fault.Tesla’s SecrecyDue to his pacifist sympathies, Tesla originally contemplated giving hiselectric flying machine to the Geneva Convention or League of Nations, for usein ‘policing the world’ to prevent war. Later disillusioned after WW I with thecollapse of the League, he said he’d “underestimated man’s combativecapacity.”50In 1919, Tesla’s reason for increased secrecy emerged51 , while49 49. Sir Edmund Whittaker, A History of the Theories of the Aether andElectricity, (1910) Edinborough.50 50. Nikola Tesla, New York Times, article (July 10. 1934).51 51. Tesla Interview with Frederick M. Kerby, Resolution Magazine, (1919).discussing his plans for a “three-hour” airplane between New York and London:“...we have here the appalling prospect of a war between nations at a distanceof thousands of miles, with weapons so destructive and demoralizing that theworld could not endure them. That is why there must be no more war.” With the U.S. government’s spurning of his defense suggestions and technology, Tesla’s onlyrecourse was to withhold his Dynamic Theory of Gravity, and to dissuadediscovery in that direction. But he had already sold his secrets to the Germansin 1914.In 192952 Tesla ridiculed Heinrich Hertz’s 1887-89 experiments purportedlyproving the Maxwellian “structureless” ether filling all space, “ofinconceivable tenuity yet solid and possessed of rigidity incomparably greaterthan the hardest steel.” Tesla’s arguments were to the contrary, saying he hadalways believed in a “gaseous” ether in which he had observed (longitudinal)waves more akin to sound waves. He recounted how he had developed a “new form ofvacuum tube” in 1896, “...capable of being charged to any desired potential, andoperated it with effective pressures of about 4,000,000 volts.” He described howblue coronal discharges about the bulb when in use, verified the existence of“particles smaller than air” , and a gas so light that an earth-sized volumewould weight only 1/20 pound. He further said that so-called “electromagneticwaves” are actually longitudinal--not transverse---sound waves moving at thevelocity of light through this medium.In 193253 Tesla mentioned using his special tube to investigate cosmic rays,saying that when its emanations were impinged upon a target material,radioactive emissions resulted, and that radioactive bodies were simply“targets” continuously bombarded by “infinetesimal bullets projected from allparts of the universe”, without which “all radioactivity would cease”. His namefor these “bullets” was “Primary Solar Rays”.Later in 193254 , Tesla said Einstein’s theory regarding changing matter intoforce, and force into matter, was “absurd”. He compared this to the differencebetween body and mind, saying force is a52 52. Nikola Tesla interview, New York Herald Tribune, (Sept. 22, 1929), pp. 1,29.53 53. Letter, New York Times, (Feb. 6, 1932), p. 16, col. 8.54 54. Nikola Tesla Papers , Rare Books and Manuscript Library, ColumbiaUniversity (Apr. 15,1932).“...function of matter” , and that, just as a mind could not exist without abody, “...without matter, there can be no force.”Again in 193255 , Tesla derided the Maxwellian/Hertzian ether, while saying thathigher frequency waves “...follow the curvature of the earth and bend aroundobstacles” , yet in Apr. 8, 193456 , Tesla said that short waves for “powerpurposes” of the ‘wireless art’, were inappropriate, and that power will travelin “long waves”. All this in retrospect to deaf ears since no one in thepublic’s knowledge uses wireless technology to transmit energy today, and no onesince Tesla has been able to do so because they haven’t paid close attention toall that Tesla said (that we in the public know of).With so many “experts” today claiming to know Tesla technology such as those whosay that Tesla used “quaternion equations” (“curved space-time” and“fourth-dimensional” math, ala relativism), I will settle once and for all thequestion of authenticity of these “experts” on Tesla. Lest there be anymisunderstanding or confusion about Tesla’s beliefs, here is a 1932 newspaperquote under the headline “Pioneer Radio Engineer Gives Views on power:\"The assumption of the Maxwellian ether was thought necessary to explain thepropagation of light by transverse vibrations, which can only occur in a solid.So fascinating was this theory that even at present it has many supporters,despite the manifest impossibility of a medium, perfectly mobile and tenuous toa degree inconceivable, and yet extremely rigid, like steel. As a result someillusionary ideas have been formed and various phenomena erroneouslyinterpreted. The so-called Hertz waves are still considered a reality provingthat light is electrical in its nature, and also that the ether is capable oftransmitting transverse vibrations of frequencies however low. This view hasbecome untenable since I showed that the universal medium is a gaseous body inwhich only longitudinal pulses can be propagated, involving alternatingcompressions and expansions similar to those produced by sound waves in the air.Thus, a wireless transmitter does not emit Hertz waves which are a myth, butsound waves in the ether, behaving in every respect like those in the air,except that, owing to the great elastic force and extremely small density of themedium, their speed is that of light. general knowledge of this subject seemsvery limited, I may state, that even waves only one or two millimeters long,which I produced thirtythree years ago, provided that they carry sufficientenergy, can be transmitted around the globe. This is not so much due torefraction and reflection as to the properties of a gaseous medium and certainpeculiar action which I shall explain some time in the future. At present it maybe sufficient to call attention to an important fact in this connection, namely,that this bending of the beam projected from reflector does not affect in theleast its behavior in other respects.55 55. Nikola Tesla, New York Herald Tribune, (Sept. 11, 1932). 56 56. NikolaTesla letter, New York Times, (Apr. 8, 1934).It might be inferred that I am alluding to the curvature of space supposed toexist according to the teachings of relativity, but nothing could be furtherfrom my mind. I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that itcan have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He hasnot, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we canonly speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in thepresence of large bodies space becomes curved, is equivalent to stating thatsomething can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.\"Anyone who says otherwise after reading this quote is definitely a liar orsomeone who has serious reading comprehension problems and shouldn’t be takenseriously. You may agree or disagree with it but you can’t deny that this iswhat the man said and meant.THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITYWhat were the old ether physicists referring to when they attempted to describe“an incompressible, perfect fluid”? What would a “perfect fluid” do? It would beable to “wet” and soak into everything it came into contact with, such asprotons, and neutrons, and could flow everywhere often without resistance(except in the circumstances already described). This fluid, the ether, becauseof its ultra-fineness, could flow everywhere. Grosser matter on the other hand,experienced resistance, depending on the circumstances. Anotherfluid—electricity—could flow in certain places, and wet only certain things, butoften met resistance.In his 1891 A.I.E.E. lecture at Columbia College, Tesla said (in pertinent part,emphasis mine): “What is electricity, and what is magnetism? “...We are nowconfident that electric and magnetic phenomena are attributable to the ether,and we are perhaps justified in saying that the effects of static electricityare effects of ether in motion.” “...we may speak of electricity or of anelectric condition, state or effect.” “...we must distinguish two such effects,opposite in character neutralizing each other.” “...for in a medium of theproperties of the ether, we cannot possibly exert a strain, or produce adisplacement or motion of any kind, without causing in the surrounding medium anequivalent and opposite effect.” “...its condition determines the positive andnegative character.” “We know that it acts like an incompressible fluid;”“...the electro-magnetic theory of light and all facts observed teach us thatelectric and ether phenomena are identical.” “The puzzling behavior of the etheras a solid to waves of light and heat, and as a fluid to the motion of bodiesthrough it, is certainly explained in the most natural and satisfactory mannerby assuming it to be in motion, as Sir William Thomson has suggested.” “Nor cananyone prove that there are transverse ether waves emitted from an alternatecurrent machine; to such slow disturbances, the ether, if at rest, may behave asa true fluid.”In his statements, Tesla was balancing the various arguments in preparation forhis decision: “...Electricity, therefore, cannot be called ether in the broadsense of the term; but nothing would seem to stand in the way of callingelectricity ether associated with matter, or bound ether; or, in other words,that the so-called static charge of the molecule is ether associated in some waywith the molecule.”“...It cannot differ in density, ether being incompressible; it must, therefore,be under some strain or in motion, and the latter is the most probable.”Tesla therefore believed in 1891 in an ether which was in motion relative toearth. I think this belief was modulated in Tesla’s 1899 Colorado SpringsExperiments due to his discovery that the earth emits rapidly-varyingelectrostatic forces which rigidify the ether in the earth’s electric field andcreate the “carry along” ether, while the tubes of force induced by this are inrelative motion.The thing which Tesla had realized, was that ether possesses electric chargeswhich are deposited on molecules. His “dynamic” ether belief is consistent withthe idea that everything is in motion.The importance of cosmic motion to the effects of electrostatic charges wasapparently brought up by Tesla in his lecture: “About fifteen years ago, Prof.Rowland demonstrated a most interesting and important fact, namely that a staticcharge carried around produces the effects of an electric current.” “...andconceiving the electrostatically charged molecule in motion, this experimentalfact gives us a fair idea of magnetism. We can conceive lines or tubes of forcewhich physically exist, being formed of rows of directed moving molecules; wecan see that these lines must be closed, that they must tend to shorten andexpand, etc. It likewise explains in a reasonable way, the most puzzlingphenomenon of all, permanent magnetism, and, in general, has all the beauties ofthe Ampere theory without possessing the vital defect of the same, namely, theassumption of molecular currents. Without enlarging further upon the subject, Iwould say, that I look upon all electrostatic, current and magnetic phenomena asbeing due to electrostatic molecular forces.”In these statements, Tesla showed he was aware that any “stationary” locale onearth is actually in fantastic motion (“70,000 mph”). The electrostatic charges“carried around” are currents between atoms and the ether, which producemagnetism. The phenomena of ‘permanent magnetism’ or ‘cosmically induced’magnetism are apparently due to electrostatic charges ‘carried around’ by cosmicmolecular motion, in the universal ether field.Since no one can hold atoms, electrons or molecules perfectly still—because theyare in fantastic motion—all atoms and molecules carry currents producingmagnetic fields. Since a magnetic field is the product of a current, no one canproduce a magnetic field without electricity, moving through or along aconductor, or as electrostatic charges in local or cosmic motion.CONCLUSIONSince these phenomena are electro-mechanical in nature, they are synthesized byrecreation of the electromagnetic conditions which a body would exhibit due to aparticular kinetic state. Just as sound waves of low frequency can penetrate abody, waves of higher frequencies can cause the ether to “assert its inertiaresistance.”Tesla stated that the steady “brush” discharge causes a steady exchange ofcarriers, but emphasized the necessity of the “rapidlyvarying electrostatic”impulses to create sound waves in the ether to cause it to assert its “inertiaresistance” and form the tubes of force. Here is where Tesla said the best ofelectrical engineers would not believe it, that the rapidly-varyingelectrostatic potentials create the steady D.C. potential which causes a steadyexchange of carriers, which brings in the tubes of force to propel his ship.Because the D.C. potential is undisturbed yet continuous and rapidly-varying, itis nonetheless “steady”.The technology involves high voltage (“D.C.”) electrostatic ‘brush’ currents ontop of the ship and which rarefies the elastic ether and creates the bouyancy ofthe ship, and in front which stretches (“rarefies”) the elastic ether and pullsthe ship forward, while a higher frequency A.C. current compresses the ether andblocks ether from passing through the rear of the ship. These currents force thetubes of force to dissolve in the conductors of the ship and impart momentum.Since the strength of the electrical attractive force is 2 x 1039 power timesstronger than the gravitational attractive force, that much more work cantheoretically be done in the same amount of time, using the same “energy”. Andthat is how the ship I saw in 1953 accelerated to ca. 36,000 mph in threeseconds.Since “seeing is believing”, and I have seen, I believe. The behavior ofman-made flying saucers proves the existence of these “free energy” inventionsof Nikola Tesla, which show that he was right in his opposition to Relativism,and that the prevalent theories taught in the scientific institutions of theworld today are false.Consistent with the idea that “dynamite comes in small packages”, this smallbook, along with my prior book, Space Aliens From the Pentagon , along with mythird edition of that book, Pentagon Aliens , have all initiated therediscovery, reconstruction and publication of Nikola Tesla’s Dynamic Theory ofGravity and related electro-mechanical propulsion technology, the greatestinvention of mankind.The deep black Secret Government by whatever name, be it “illuminati”, “cabal”or whatever —a fraudulently concealed, unconstitutional, corporate-stateentity—has heretofore controlled electro-mechanical propulsion technology byconcealing it along with other advanced free energy technology, on behalf ofinternational, coercive, corporate-state monopolists. Electro-mechanicallypropeled ships are concealed through “special effects”, and “stealth” technology(also based on Tesla inventions)—as they fly over and hover in the sky, and by“psycho-political” means—the dissemination of false “alien” and“extraterrestrial” origins propaganda—through “UFOlogy” groups led by covertgovernment agents. While official government spokesmen deny the existence offlying saucers, covert government agents, posing as “skeptics”, “UFOlogists”,and “paranormalists”, engage the public’s attention in a phony debate. The“skeptics” ridicule the UFOlogists and paranormalists, lumping them togetherwith rational witnesses, as if “...to see a flying saucer” is as ridiculous as“...to see a ghost or alien”. This phony debate based on false logic fits nicelyinto the overall cover-up system, designed to conceal advanced human technology,not “alien” technology.The grip of this secret socio-economic dictatorship depends on coercivelyextorted income, by forcing us to buy archaic fuels and power—which funds itscontrol of our communications, political and monetary decisions, enforcement ofunjust laws, regulations and procedures expanding its powers, while limiting orexcluding our individual human rights, and denying our access to information,materials, and technology which is ours because we paid for it with our taxes.Our access to the truth is necessary for our fully-informed consent,independence, and survival as a free people.Despite the confusion, concealment, BIG LIES, and judicial and socio-economicabuse by the corporate state, we can resurrect the TRUTH, determine the correcttechnology, circumvent obstructions, and use our creative ingenuity to buildthese ships for ourselves, to free our society from the Secret FascistCorpocracy.There is much confusion created by government agents or dupes regarding UFOpropulsion technology. Do not be fooled. You will find no “patents” on thistechnology because it is secret, “classified” information by all the majorgovernments of the world. Anyone who shows you a “patent” purporting torepresent this technology is either a liar or a fool, and could only show you“how NOT to build a UFO”. The same goes for anyone who jabbers idiotic nonsenseabout “space aliens”. These craft are exclusively man-made.Below is a post from the Electrical Review 57 , entitled, which also appeared inThe Sun, N.Y., Nov. 21, 1898, and which contains some pertinent informationrelating to when Tesla began to develop his flying machine, more particularlywhat he called his “dirigible torpedo”:“Referring to my latest invention, I wish to bring out a point which has beenoverlooked. I arrived, as has been stated, at the idea through entirely abstractspeculations on the human organism, which I conceived to be a selfpropellingmachine, the motions of which are governed by impressions received through theeye. Endeavoring to construct a mechanical model resembling in its essential,material features the human body, I was led to combine a controlling device, ororgan sensitive to certain waves, with a body provided with propelling anddirecting mechanism, and the rest naturally followed. Originally the ideainterested me only from the scientific point of view, but soon I saw that I hadmade a departure which sooner or later must produce a profound change in thingsand conditions presently existing. I hope this change will be for the good only,for, if it were otherwise, I wish that I had never made the invention. Thefuture may or may not bear out my present convictions, but I can not refrainfrom saying that it is difficult for me to see at present how, with such aprinciple brought to great perfection, as it undoubtedly will be in the courseof time, guns can maintain themselves as weapons. We shall be able, by availingourselves of this advance, to send a projectile at much greater distance, itwill not be limited in any way by weight or amount of explosive charge, we shallbe able to submerge it at command, to arrest it in its flight, and call it back,and to send it out again and explode it at will, and more than this, it willnever make a miss, since all chance in this regard, if hitting the object ofattack were at all required, is eliminated. But the chief feature of such aweapon is still to be told; namely, it may be made to respond only to a certainnote or tune, it may be endowed with selective power. Directly such an arm isproduced, it becomes almost impossible to meet it with a correspondingdevelopment. It is this feature, perhaps, more than in its power of destruction,that its tendency to arrest the development of arms and to stop warfare willreside. With renewed thanks, I remain,Very truly, yours, N. Tesla”57 57. Nikola Tesla, Electrical Review (Nov. 19, 1898) New York.Tesla didn’t want to give the whole ball game away on his propulsion system, andwas secretive about it, which is why he never published his completed DynamicTheory of Gravity. By habit, if Tesla disagreed with a theory, he usually wastedlittle time in refuting it. In scenting out Tesla's secret ether theory thatTesla relied upon for his propulsion system, I compared it with a theory whichhe did not even mention, J. J. Thomson’s Electromagnetic Momentum theory. WhileTesla had in fact gotten into rather spirited exchanges with Thomson regardingelectrostatic versus electrodynamic excitation of luminosity of gases in a tubeat a distance, that was the most that Tesla was willing to risk. he never said aword directly regarding Thomson’s Electromagnetic Momentum theory, which waswrong because it was based on the 'solid ether' and electromagnetic waves theoryof Maxwell and Hertz.The absence of a specific refutation or even a mention of it is a conspicuousomission which points to Tesla’s thinking on this subject once one realizes thatthis is a pattern seldom if ever broken by Tesla. What this means is that,regarding Thomson’s Electromagnetic Momentum theory, Tesla could not criticizeThomson's theory without revealing his own ether propulsion theory. He hadalready discussed his use of electrostatically-induced mechanical waves ratherthan the supposed electrodynamics of Thomson. Not only that, but Tesla could noteven mention the theory specifically lest he draw attention to his own theoryand disclose his most important secret.In a similar vein however Tesla had earlier stated (Electric Discharges inVacuum Tubes, The Electrical Engineer , N.Y., July 1, 1891) “...theelectrostatic effects were of far greater importance...” and “In using the termelectrostatic I had reference rather to the nature of the action than to astationary condition, which is the usual acceptance of the term.” To thisThomson agreed, saying “As a matter of fact, it is very much easier to get theluminosity when these electrostatic effects are operative than when they arenot.” (Note by Prof. J. J. Thomson in the London Electrician , July 24, 1891).There is in my opinion, based on all my studies, only one kind of UFO propulsiontechnology and it is electro-mechanical, invented by Nikola Tesla. From myobservations of the ship I saw at close range in broad daylight in 1953, therewere no intake or exhaust ports, no jets or rockets, no “plasma” repulsionsystem, etc. The ship was apparently sustained and moved without these, the onlyexternal evidence being high voltage electrostatic corona. When you have a shipwhich can fly at 36,000 miles per hour in 1953 you cannot want for more.While Thomson's theory proposed a Maxwellian three-axis system which usedelectric and magnetic force on two of the axes to purportedly create momentum onthe third axis, Tesla used “p2”, a combination of electrostatic brush dischargein the ether projected in the direction of travel and high frequency A.C. in theopposite direction to block the ether and that was it. Tesla proved that Maxwellwas wrong regarding electromagnetic waves in free space and rejected thosetheories, which were based on Hertz's erroneous theory of a solid ether.Some of you reading this may have thought there was a contradiction betweenTesla's statement that his flying machine was propelled by “mechanical” waves topropel his ship with a “pulling” action (ropes pull), then referred to the“steady D.C. brush discharge” as a means of creating the continuous exchange ofcarriers which imparts “mechanical” momentum to the ship. Both these means arecombined, and Tesla also referred to “environmental” energy in free space, whichcan be harvested.To put it into a nutshell, the rapidly-varying electrostatic potentials tuned toone-quarter wavelength produces the steady D.C. brush discharge which rarefies(stretches) the ether, while the rapidly-varying electrostatic potentials tunedto one-half or full (resonant) wavelength produces the reaction which compressesthe ether. The sound waves in the ether are also used for transmitting wirelessenergy. A quarter wavelength tuning is for transmitting, while the half or fullwavelength tuning for receiving, but at high frequencies has the effect ofblocking the ether by compression.Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity and method of mechanical space propulsionbrought a cosmic crowning achievement to the works of his esteemed predecessorswho did so much of the ground work, but the public has been denied thisachievement.CHAPTER VI: FREE ENERGY MASSACRE;The Atomic Hydrogen Process ©1996, Wm. R. LyneWhat better way to end a book on “Occult Ether Physics” than with a chapter onanother concealed “free energy” process, which appears to extract energy fromthe environment—using similar techniques on the same substance—the ether—thatmakes Tesla’s electro-mechanical propulsion possible?In Space Aliens From the Pentagon and Pentagon Aliens I specified a free energyprocess in which helium is made to produce 460,000 calories/gram-atom by simplespark discharge, which is based on data from numerous generally available textsand scientific encyclopedias. This is the highest energy output I know of from anoble gas, and the same gas can be used ad infinitum , the only input energybeing that required from spark discharges. Since helium is inappropriate for theaverage “Joe” and since the output is probably more than you could handle, Iwill more appropriately show you how to perform another free energy process,using that most easily accessible gas, hydrogen. This chapter will also give youthe explanation for the heat produced in so-called “cold fusion” and a few otherfree energy processes, all closely related to the atomic hydrogen process andoccult ether physics.Over the years, the “Relativistic Quantum Mechanics” (hence “RQMs”) concealedevery process or reaction which could show the invalidity of their theories,“...in the interest of national security”. Their false theories actually becameone of the most important means by which, from the standpoint of the controllingcorporate fascists, all ‘dangerously efficient’ (i.e., “disruptive”) technologywhich would destroy their iron grip on us, could be concealed. According todeceitful relativist quantum mechanics, all energy coming out of a reaction mustgo into it only from a source recognized by them, and only in the discrete“quanta” permitted by Planck’s earlier quantum theory. The basic idea ofPlanck’s original quantum mechanical theory, was that energy levels of atomsmust change in whole number integers (1, 2, 3, etc.) called “quanta”, which arebased on the basic charge of a single electron or multiples thereof, whichassumes only certain assigned energy levels in different atoms and molecules,and is used to define the magnitude of all of the smallest, intermediate, andlargest possible energy changes of atoms and molecules. All atomic energychanges must conform to the permissible whole number equivalents or multiples ofthese quanta. Accordingly, energy absorbed or emitted by an atom must fit thisstringent criterion.What, then, would you say about a process which completely destroys this neatplan, which causes atoms to emit more energy that that which was put into them?Despite what I consider to be obvious attempts to conceal basic physical dataconflicting with this principle—as defined by the RQMs and incorporated intotheir theory, as if it were exclusively their theory and not that publishedearlier by Planck—the process I am about to discuss with you has glaringinconsistencies in it, as described by the Relativists, in particular IrvingLangmuir. Langmuir was wrong and my research, invention and experiments andtests based on it prove him wrong.It is said by the RQMs that the process of dissociating diatomic hydrogenmolecules into separate atoms as atomic hydrogen, requires the absorption of109,000 cal./gram molecule (“1.9 k.cal./gram molecule”), and that that is allthe energy you can possibly get out of it. Yet, in taking the basic hydrogenatom and considering all its discrete ‘quanta’—whether in the atomic ormolecular state—it appears to me that there is no state of the hydrogen atom ormolecule in which such energy could be “stored”, even when using the RQMs’theories,, especially in view of their irrational statement that the energy isstill possessed by the molecule after it has already been released! It is theircontention that an independent hydrogen atom can only exist as such because ithas absorbed an abnormally large amount of heat, despite the fact that by theirown criteria the atom has no mechanism identifiable by them by which it could doso.When two such hydrogen atoms come together with the presence of sufficientelectrostatic initiation energy, the great amount of heat said by theRelativists to be “stored” in the hydrogen atom is liberated. The RQMs neverdirectly measured the amount of dissociation energy necessary to bring thehydrogen atom from the diatomic to the atomic state, because they didn’t knowhow to do so, but because their theory said that this reaction is reversible,they said the dissociation energy was the same as the energy released onrecombination of hydrogen atoms. Then to make matters worse, they defined theatomic hydrogen (ground) state as if it were an excited state, and the molecularstate as if it were the ground state.Realistically, the atomic hydrogen reaction can only be satisfactorily explainedby reference to, construction of, or reconstruction of, an ether theory andinvolving Tesla's Primary Solar Rays (one form of “environmental energy”). Whileit may be arguable that the electrostatic “binding energy” between the two atomsof the molecule somehow ‘includes’ this energy in some undefined and mysteriousway, this argument actually supports an ether theory, since the binding energy(from somewhere) must somehow be exchanged with what is said to be the heatenergy which is released when the molecule forms, according to their theory,consistent with the equal-and-opposite-reaction rule. Otherwise, one is expectedto believe a kind of backwards Orwellian doublethink that the RQMs. This kind oflatitude is permitted only for them, while those who disagree are held to ahigher standard.The doublethink (contradictory) features of Relativism apparently stem from thefact that Albert Einstein was a KaballistExistentialist—whose epistemology was aPlatonist one. In philosophy, there are two basic epistemologies—theories of theorigin, nature and limits of human knowledge—representing the two basiccategories into which the epistemologies of all philosophies must fall, andwhich are supposed to explain how one knows something according to a particularphilosophy...by what means they know it...if in fact, they do “know” it. Sincehe who asserts something has the burden of proving it, rather than one whodisbelieves it, the means by which it is purportedly known may come intoquestion. No one is legally, morally, or “spiritually’ obligated to believeanything, without reason, or a valid means of knowing it to be “true”. Allepistemologies are classified as either Platonist or Aristotelian.The “Platonist Epistemology” is so named because of the theory illustrated bythe ancient Greek philosopher Plato’s cave analogy, in his book, The Republic .In this analogy, an observer inside a cave (us), facing the inner wall at night,sees only the shadows cast upon the wall by such things as a passing caravan,projected by a fire burning beyond a road along which the caravan is passing.According to Plato, man cannot know reality, but sees only a ‘shadow’ ofreality, because there is a ‘higher world’ of ‘perfect forms’, which exist only‘in heaven’. It therefore becomes obvious how this epistemology followsreligious thinking, and that many religions have been influenced by it assomehow adding ‘scientific credence’ to their religious ideas, which are basedon faith rather than reason. The same reasoning has been used by scientific,philosophical, economic, political, and ‘spiritual’ con-artists for centuries,and every totalitarian philosophy ever known has relied upon this fallacious‘reasoning’ which is identical to the Platonist epistemology, because itrelieves its advocates of showing reason and logic for what they assert. Onewonders how the viewer in Plato’s cave would draw the line between ‘knowing’ ashadow, and a “shadow of a shadow”, since a shadow might also have a ‘higherform’ under this theory.The “Aristotelian Epistemology” in the meanwhile—based on the ancient Greekphilosopher Aristotle’s theory of knowledge— holds that the senses are valid,scientific tools of cognition, which we can rely upon to detect the facts ofperceivable reality, and that we can, by relying upon the facts so perceived,know reality—and the nature of reality—and based on that, determine other,perhaps unapparent facts of reality.As can be seen from a comparison of these two epistemologies and theirimplications, the philosophies and endeavors based on the Platonist epistemologyare mystical, nebulous and/or totalitarian because its advocates require you tobelieve things based on faith and not reason, while the Aristotelians are morerational and objective, especially when applied to the natural sciences. It canalso be seen that the use of a Platonist Epistemology by a physicist should beconsidered unforgivable, while Einstein’s theory, built upon this fatally flawedepistemology, has been popularized by the communication monopoly controlled bythe power élite, because it makes a potentially inquisitive and questioningsociety dumber and easier to control. Einstein’s image is continually built upas if that of an ultimate and infallible creature who should be regarded as a‘god’. This propaganda not only protects the false theory but also aids inconcealment of valid theory and advanced technology which would end the reign ofa world-wide power structure of corporate-statists, who think society alreadyhas all the technology it ‘needs’, else the élite’s ‘grip’ on the world, held inplace by their archaic technology which exploits mineral, industrial, andbanking interests owned by them, might be torn loose. Although Einsteineventually admitted in the 1920s that 'there has to be an ether', he neverfollowed up on that change in his ideas with anything concrete, although hisfriend Paul Dirac did in a paper he sent to Einstein arguing for an ether.I would have very little quarrel with a quantum theory of atomic energy levels,were it extended to include somehow the phenomenon of external environmentalenergy and ether theory as it should have been logically construed, but I takeissue with its present development, limitation, and abuse by the RQMs.My position is that they already have covertly applied it to an ether theory,that this application is well concealed, and that this book is needed to beginthe reconstruction of these concealed truths, for use by the public. WhilePlanck said his quantum theory applied to a “system”, he didn’t say the“Relativist system of Einstein”— which came into vogue after Planck’s theory—andwas the only system it could be applied to. Since a rationally extended quantummechanical theory would not exclude an ether, my “RQM” label distinguishesbetween the relativistic misinterpreters of quantum mechanics, and what could becalled the “Integrated Reality Mechanics” (“IRMs”).The atomic hydrogen reaction first came to my attention in 1964, when I wasstudying industrial processes at Sam Houston State University, Huntsville,Texas, the year after taking an introductory course in college physics. Whilereviewing various welding processes in a textbook, my eyes fixed on an olderprocess called “atomic hydrogen welding”. By that time, the process was alreadyconsidered “obsolete”. To me, the process seemed valuable, not only because itproduces such high temperatures—up to 5,000° C., more than enough to melttungsten with a M.P. Of 3410° C., and the highest temperature producible byman—but also because it is “selfshielding”, can be used to weld diverse metals(often without flux) and produces a concentrated flame, with little heatdistortion when welding thin metal. In the process, ‘normal’ diatomic H2 is shotthrough an electric arc which dissociates it into “atomic” hydrogen, H1 . Thisatomic hydrogen recombines at the (welded) metal surface, producing the veryhigh heat. Though the process interested me then, and always has, I have neverseen an atomic hydrogen welding unit for sale for the many years hence.Industry’s obvious excuse for laying the valuable process aside was that it hasbeen replaced by ‘better’ processes, such as Heliarc (TIG, “Tungsten Inert Gas”)and MIG welding, though they also rarely mention “plasma arc welding”, which hasalso almost disappeared from the market. Since plasma arc welding is merely anextension of the atomic hydrogen and TIG processes, using a specially redesignedtorch, the mysterious reasons are undoubtedly the same. Neither of these twoprocesses uses a lot of “consumables” (welding fluxes, rods, gases, etc.).It was then that I got the idea of my atomic hydrogen furnace. The processsimmered in the inner recesses of my mind, taking shape for a few years until1976, when I rekindled my interest in the process for possible use in weldingstainless steel and reducing and fusing platinum metal compounds, becausehydrogen reduces such compounds (which must also be shielded from oxygen) totheir metallic states. The atomic hydrogen process does not rely upon thecombustion of hydrogen with oxygen in the air, but upon the purportedly “atomic”energy released when the atomic hydrogen recombines to form the ‘normal’diatomic hydrogen. I still had some unanswered questions, since the variouswelding data at my disposal failed to mention sufficient specific details.If Nikola Tesla was right, then I am right, that atomic energy comes through theether from the Primary Solar Rays, not from the radioactive elements themselves.Because I knew of no source from which to purchase an atomic hydrogen torch in1985, I decided to build one, but my information was inadequate for properconstruction. In the torch I made, the hydrogen entered the arc concentricallyaround both electrodes, instead of passing through the arc at a right angle. Ialso used the wrong kind of arc transformer, so it didn’t work as well as itshould have.Despite the disappointment, I knew the torch would work better if I correctedthe problems, so I kept the torch in my barn until better information andsufficient time was available. I excited the curiosity of the industrial spieswhen I rented a large tank of hydrogen at a local welders’ supply, and thisprobably contributed to the sudden acceleration of the CIA-maintained judicialharassment that I endured between 1974 and 1992 (18 years). They apparentlyassumed I was exploring the process for its energy potential, rather than forjust welding, and they were correct. My torch is shown below:[Image00011.gif]In the ‘70s, I had acquired an old English inorganic chemistry textbook58 ,purchased from Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory salvage for $.25, whichcontained a halftone photo of a 1930s vintage atomic hydrogen welding torch,along with some basic data. The torch shown was different from the one Iconstructed, in that I used a high voltage arc transformer and had no mechanismto strike the arc electrodes together to start the arc, because the high voltagemade it unnecessary. It also showed the gas passing through the arc at a rightangle. In this old textbook, it was stated at page 170 (emphasis mine), asfollows:“Langmuir (1912) discovered that hydrogen at low pressure in contact with atungsten wire heated by an electric current is dissociated to some extent intoatoms:”...“This absorbs a large amount of energy, about 100 kcal. pergram-molecule.” “...The atomic hydrogen formed is chemically very active. Atomichydrogen is formed when an electric arc between tungsten electrodes is allowedto burn in hydrogen at atmospheric pressures (Fig. 106).” (NOTE: This statementshows a basic misunderstanding of the process by Langmuir and others before myideas emerged.) The58 58. J. R. Partington, Text-Book of Inorganic Chemistry (1953) Macmillan andCo., London.text continued:“Atomic-hydrogen blown out of the arc by a jet of molecular hydrogenacross the arc, forms an intensely hot flame, capable of melting tungsten (m.Pt. 3400°). This flame obtains its heat from recombination of hydrogenatoms to H2 .”“Hydrogen being set free in a chemical reaction is often more reactivethan hydrogen gas.”“...the activity of such nascent (newborn) hydrogen, in the act ofliberation from its compounds, is due to the hydrogen being in the atomicstate.”The following is a copy of “fig. 106”:[Image00012.gif]In checking this data in a more recent Van Nostrand’s Encyclopedia of Science59, at page 1311 it was stated in pertinent part:“Hydrogen molecules dissociate to atoms endothermically at high temperatures(heat of dissociation about 103 cal/gram mole) in an electric arc, or byirradiation.” “...the hydrogen atoms recombine at the metal surface to provideheat required for welding.”59 59. Van Nostrand’s Scientific Encyclopedia , Fifth Edition (edited by DouglasM. Considine), Van Nostrand Reinhold Company (1976).I was surprised to find this in the Van Nostrand encyclopedia, but I also foundthat in 1910, the D. Van Nostrand Company published a book by Haller andCunningham entitled The High Frequency Coil (The construction of a Tesla Coilfor the advanced amateur. 119 pages), so there is a record of the Van Nostrandcompany’s association with Tesla technology.SMOKESCREENS FROM ACADEMIAIt seemed odd to me that it was later suggested that the 103 calories ofdissociation energy absorbed from a very brief exposure to the arc is the sameheat as that “...required for welding” as described, and I believed it to bemore reasonable that the excess heat had to come from “elsewhere”. I believe thetrue dissociation energy must be somewhere between the 103 calories and the 109kcals./gram mole.The older text showed the clearer construction of a device, and the newer textshowed that only 103 cal./gram mole were required for dissociation, while theolder text (Langmuir) showed that 100,000 cal./gram mole were liberated onrecombination. Only by jumping back and forth between the two sources was I ableto put a complete documentation together, and discover the conflicts. It meantthat if the 103 cal./gram mole dissociation energy was correct, that with the109 k.cal/gram mole output, the process was theoretically capable of producing1,058 times the input energy. This is probably too high but it is definitelyhigher than all previous calculations.It was apparent from the newer text that the writers intended for us to believethat the final 100 k.cal./gram mole heat—later upped to 109 k.cal./gram mole—wasabsorbed from the arc, but the 103 cal./gram mole dissociation heat figureshowed a net 108,897 cal./gram mole unexplained. If there are about 22.4 cubicliters or 22,400 cubic cm. If that amount of hydrogen at STP can be dissociatedby 103 calories of heat seemed astounding, but since hydrogen is the lightestelement, it might be possible, but considering the idea that this same volume ofhydrogen, weighing one gram, could somehow carry the heat of 109,000calories—equivalent to the caloric heat of about 75 loaves of bread weighing atleast 112 lbs.—it seemed ludicrous. This bread would weigh 50,400 times the gramof hydrogen, and the actual hydrogen content would be so much greater than thatgram of hydrogen, so that the “official story” seemed impossible. So the “extraheat” appears to come from an officially unidentified source.The idea that sufficient energy to weld could be extracted by the arc during thetime required for the gas to pass from the orifice and through the arc isremarkable. The time required for 22,400 cubic cm. to pass through the arcallows for .2 calories per cubic cm. Five cubic cm. of gas would be required toprovide each calorie of heat, amounting to 1/9th of one slice of bread. Aminimum number of cubic cm. per second of hydrogen involved in making a weld isobviously required.109,000 cal./gram mole equals 432.5 BTU/gram mole—roughly the heat energycontained in 75 loaves of bread (1 lb. 8 oz. loaves at 90 calories per each of16 slices)—so the heat energy which they have asked us to believe is ‘stored’ inan amount of atomic hydrogen which weighs 1/28th of an ounce, during its passagethrough the arc seems incredible. Yet the transformer is required to produceonly half what it does in conventional welding processes. It seems more likelythat excess heat could be stored in molecules than in ‘almost naked’ atomichydrogen atoms. What ever happened to Bohr’s little atom! It got bigger, andbigger, and .......Between the older text (1921-1950, from the first and sixth editions) and thenewer (1976) Norton science encyclopedia, it was obvious that science was muchmore simpler in the pre-National Security Act days, and that in the newer text,there was a reflection of the fishy attempts brought on by the national securitylaws and the firmer establishment of the RQMs, to conceal certain scientificknowledge which had been discovered all the way back in 1912 by Langmuir, and Ieven find it hard to believe that Langmuir did not know or suspect the truth.Aside from the discrepancies between the older measurements, regarding thecomparable outputs between the combustion of gasoline and the combustion ofmolecular hydrogen, and the output from the atomic hydrogen process, to thenewer text, there was a failure, so far as I could determine, to state underappropriate references (or any others I could find) some important factsconcerning atomic hydrogen, and even apparent misrepresentations of the actualcomparative outputs of gasoline and hydrogen combustion, through“doublethink”—the Orwellian “badges of fraud”—of which I spoke in Space Aliens.Though this 103 cal./gram mole “slip” appears to have been made, Nortonapparently was also forced by circumstances to rely on some ‘scientists’ whorepresented the fossil fuel cartels and other conflicting interests, while theolder text, though inaccurate, should have been relatively free of suchinfluences at that time, but maybe not.For example, in the newer text, page 1311, energy from the combustion ofhydrogen was stated at 29,000 calories per gram (52,200 BTU/lb.). In the oldertext, this value was given at 62,100 BTU/lb., with a comparative value forgasoline (“petroleum”) at 19,800 BTU/lb., stretched to 20,825 BTU/lb. in thenewer encyclopedia. These figures roughly comported with those in theencyclopedia for n-Heptane (“gasoline”) at 19,314 BTU/lb., and hydrogen at51,571.4 BTU/lb., more or less repeated at page 1137, with n-Heptane at 10,737.2cal./gram, and hydrogen at 28,669.6 cal./gram, yet nowhere in the newer or oldertext was it affirmatively stated that the hydrogen was not “consumed” in theprocess.The corrected figure (52,200 BTU/lb.) shows, in a comparison between thecombustion of “normal hydrogen” (to form H2O) and gasoline (to form CO2), thathydrogen has a yield of roughly 2.7 times that of gasoline, by weight. Then wecome to a comparison between gasoline and atomic hydrogen. Though the two can becompared BTU-for-BTU and pound-for-pound, showing atomic hydrogen’s phenomenaloutput, the real measure of the atomic hydrogen process is gleaned only from acomparison between the “input energy)—103 cal./gram molecule—and the net output.The “input energy” would be “unity” for the process, because the process doesnot ‘consume’ the hydrogen, but only returns it to its associated diatomic stateas H2 . The dissociation energy, subtracted from the gross output, would be thenet output:109,000 cal./gram mole (gross heat output)Minus 103 cal./gram mole (dissociation energy - “unity”) Leaves 108,897cal./gram mole (net output - “over-unity” because the hydrogen didn’t have thatmuch calorific energy in the first place, and was not ‘consumed’ in the secondplace)This output is theoretically 1,058 times the input energy. In my opinion,hydrogen is not really a “fuel” in this process but rather a “medium” used inthe extraction of and conversion of energy from the Primary Solar Rays via theether, by transforming cosmic radiant energy into infrared (heat) radiation,which according to Tesla is actually (mechanical) sound waves in the ether. Theenergy required to pump the diatomic hydrogen to a holding tank, before beingrecycled and shot back through the arc and into the reaction chamber once again,is not considered in this computation because it is relatively negligible andunrelated to the process itself, since the dissociation energy is less than athousandth of the gross output, and there might be a way to make the processwork without this particular pump anyway.The manipulators of information appear to have done everything they can to makea direct comparison between atomic hydrogen and gasoline as difficult aspossible, but I have waded through a multistep mathematical, physical, chemicaland unitary process to get closer to the truth. According to 'official' sources,atomic hydrogen produces over 109 k.ca../gram mole, which is 109,000,000cal./kilo. Subtract the 103 cal./gram mole endothermic dissociation energy, anda net of 108,897 k.cal./gram mole is left.If true, the 1,058 times the input energy figure for atomic hydrogen howeverbrings into question as to whether or not the official figures for gasoline arecorrect. Perhaps they are wrong, which would explain how Shell Oil Company in abattery of efficiency tests in the ‘50s were able to get hundreds of miles pergallon of gasoline in an automobile with a specially designed carburetor.No wonder the atomic hydrogen welding process “went out of use”. With thisprocess, home consumers would pay nothing for fuel, because they could produce asmall amount of hydrogen in the basement, any time needed, and could use it overand over, ad infinitum. They could heat their houses, drive their cars, and useit for “home industry” purposes. In a motor cruiser on the ocean, one wouldnever have to worry about where the “next gallon” of fuel was coming from, orwhat it would “cost”, because like sunshine, the heat from atomic hydrogen is“free”, except, unlike sunshine, you could produce as much as you want, anytime, day or night, summer or winter, rain or shine; the farmer would no longerbe dependent upon the oil cartels for his energy, and could run his machineryand heat his barns “free”. He could tell the fuel suppliers and the banks toscrew themselves. People in the far Alaskan north could heat large spaceswithout huge expense. “Northern industry” would thrive again. The populationcontrol Nazis will hate me.It is obvious that the reason that corporations like ARCO went so heavily intoproducing solar energy equipment in the early ‘70s, was so that they couldcontrol the patents and raise the costs of solar panels and ultimately controlthe cost of (free) solar energy, to make it “competitive” with gasoline andother fossil fuels. And they were eventually busted for this anti-competitiveactivity.There are many ways used in contemporary texts to confuse facts, but the mosteffective way is by complete omission. Such facts could not have been concealedby “accident” or mere “oversight”, because they are too phenomenal. Only byplowing through a tortuous mathematical process and confusing units and otherfactors was the true motive for such concealment revealed for certain, but tellme why I’m not surprised?Conservatively speaking, the atomic hydrogen process bears a 10.5-to-l ratio ton-Heptane. Would you care for 315 miles per gallon? How about 550,000 miles? Itall depends on how many times you recycle it. You don't need to worry aboutwasting energy on electrolysis because you recycle the same hydrogencontinuously.The figures for n-Heptane are grossly confusing, as one might expect, since itis shown only by comparison by weight that hydrogen combustion has a 2.7-to-1ratio to n-Heptane. This deception was effected by playing around with differingheat and weight units, pressures, and volumes, and the difference between thecentigrade, Fahrenheit and English unit systems. The “109,000 cal./ gram mole”figure for atomic hydrogen was omitted from the newer texts, though one mighthave been able to extrapolate it from some complex data stated in other areaswhere even the inquisitive person is not expected to look. There was a totalabsence in the new text or other “new” data available to me, of a directcomparison of energy outputs between combustion of petroleum and hydrogen, muchless the atomic hydrogen process. This is of course consistent with thecontinued government secrecy since 1943 regarding the huge mass of informationon Nikola Tesla. Hide what you can. Lie, ignore or confuse about the rest. Myinvention has thrown all the data up in the air. Physics will have to make somefundamental changes.I have never seen a direct comparison by any of the thousands of Ph.D.s inchemistry or physics, who should have become aware of these facts during theircursory studies. To make these figures even more ludicrous, with BTU (“BritishThermal Units”), one would expect the weight to be shown in kilos under themetric system, instead of the English “pounds”. These machinations appear torely upon the well-founded assumption that all scientists who know, arecontrolled and don’t say, and those who aren’t controlled, will be considered“quacks” if they try to say. Again, it the usual case of “Those who know, can’tsay, and those who say, will be presumed not to know.”Another stupid trick used is to compare “system weights”, under the falseassumption that the user of hydrogen would have to use only the systems theypresent, raising the “comparable” weight of hydrogen to gasoline, usingcumbersome cryogenic bottles or hydride storage tanks, etc., when the simplefigures clearly show that onethird the amount by weight of hydrogen would beneeded for a comparable combustion process. Whenever hydride systems arementioned, there is an obvious omission of the liquid hydride system developedby Dr. Gerald Schafflander of California, the promotion for which Schafflanderand associates were abusively prosecuted by the SEC, as previously stated inSpace Aliens and Pentagon Aliens . Yet, the atomic hydrogen process would bemore than adequate—even fantastic—with only a pound of hydrogen, and one couldcarry an extra 25 lbs of Dr. Schafflander’s liquid hydride in the trunk. Belowis a direct comparison between the BTU/lb for combustion of gasoline andmolecular hydrogen, and the atomic hydrogen process, respectively:Gasoline combustion (n-Heptane) 19,314 BTU/lb Hydrogen combustion (H2 + O)52,200 BTU/lb Atomic hydrogen (H2 ⇆ 2H) 196,200 BTU/lbNote that this comparison is based on the 'accepted' value for the atomichydrogen process and does not involve a “consumption” of the hydrogen, yet evenif it did, the ration between atomic hydrogen and gasoline is still 10.5-to-one.Take into consideration also that all the best methods for obtaining over ahundred miles per gallon (even hundreds of miles per gallon) of gasoline inautomobile engines, utilize the vaporization of gasoline and mixture of it withair prior to combustion, something which is easier to do with hydrogen becauseit is in a gaseous state at normal temperatures and pressures. Also considerthat while n-Heptane is a ‘purer’ gasoline, it hasn’t been available for years,and most “gasoline” is a dilute mixture with water and various additives, withonly about 50% n-Heptane, so I’m being as kind as I can be to “gasoline”.If a pound of gasoline could propel a car 30 miles, the consumption would be666.6 BTU/mile. On the same scale, a pound of atomic hydrogen would yield 315miles. Then you could repeat it, over and over and over. A pound of hydrogencould conceivably supply all your energy needs for your whole life, and youcould produce another 100 pounds of it electrolytically, right in your basement,from tap water. Is this free energy, or what?Though the facts of this “secret” hydrogen process are “hidden in plain sight”,one must beware of the disinformation, as well as the common mistakes created by“scientists” who have been duped by the RQMs. For example, in the 1976 NortonEncyclopedia, 5th Edition, page 1311, most of the pertinent facts about hydrogenare shown. The “109,000 cal./gram molecule” for recombined hydrogen, reported inan older text, was not shown directly, though the following facts which wereshown, are of particular note:Heat of vaporization at 20.4°K 107 cal/gram Energy released upon combustion29,000 cal/gram Heat of combustion at 25°C (gross) 63,317 cal/gram Heat ofcombustion at 25°C (net) 57,797/6 cal/gramANOTHER ASTOUNDING PROOF AND MORE HYDROGEN METHODSThe Norton encyclopedia was in its 5th edition, and the “103 cal/gram mole”dissociation energy did not appear to be a typographical error or misprint, andshould have been corrected by that time if discovered. How many books would Ihave to search to find such a ‘misprint’, especially since I didn’t expect tofind the anomaly because of the obvious concealment? Yet, in PhysicalChemistry60 , at page 418, appeared the following:“The Spectroscopic evaluation of the dissociation energyThe energy of dissociation, De of a diatomic molecule is the difference betweenthe potential energy of the atoms when infinitely separated, and their energywhen the atoms are at rest at the equilibrium separation.”Notice that the “at rest” state of the molecules is couched in language thatmakes you think that the “infinitely separated” atomic hydrogen atoms representsthe “excited state” for the element. In layman’s terms, the RQMs simply made thestatement that the dissociation and recombination energies had to be the same,because their theories depended upon them being the same. Then they measured thedissociation energy backwards, by measuring the recombination energy, andstating the measurement as if it were the dissociation energy. The statementsare supplanted by a lot of RQM gobbledegook, with a “spectrographic evaluation”thrown in like some snake oil, because the spectroscope purportedly “can’t lie”.There is also in the same text, at page 417, the following obtuse statement:“...In kilocalories per mole, De is 109.”If hydrogen atoms exothermically release energy when they combine to formmolecules, the potential energy of the heat has been lost by the atoms, yet theyattribute the “potential energy” to the hydrogen molecules—backwards—to evadetheir duty to draw the logical conclusion. If this energy cannot be obtainedexcept by the prior injection of 109,000 cal/gram mole, then it is not“potential energy”. This is shown by a graph (“fig. 4\") purporting to show the60 60. E. A. Moelwyn-Hughes, Cambridge, Physical Chemistry (1965) PergamonPress, London, page 418 (Supra.).“potential energy of the hydrogen molecule in the ground electronic state.” Thisclearly appears to be a misrepresentation by a Ph.D. in physics of the “RoyalSociety”, that hydrogen in the “atomic state” is not in a ground state, but inan excited state. In this 1965 physical chemistry text from England, the heatenergy released on recombination of the hydrogen atoms is given as 109,000cal/gram mole, then misrepresented as equal to the “potential energy” of the“ground state hydrogen molecules” which have just formed. But the “ground state”of hydrogen should be the atomic state, with the electron at its lowest level ofenergy, since there appears to be no way the naked atoms could “store” the109,000 cal/gram mole. Where, exactly would this energy “reside”? I couldbelieve that the atom could capture the energy from the Primary Solar Rays ondissociation, but since the heat energy is released on recombination, themolecules lack the heat energy already released. The potential energy of theseparate atoms is greater than that of the molecules, which I think is becausethe heat energy is released from the entrained ether and converted Primary SolarRays—not from the hydrogen atoms—when they combine to form molecules.Since original publication of this book in 1997-98, there have been at leastfour specific cases where, based on my original invention, at least four testshave shown over-unity results. These are:1. D. W. Energy Research, LLC, Colorado Springs, Colorado, U.S. Patent#6,113,065, “Liquid Gasification Process”, claiming an “energy amplificationfactor of about 1.9” (a patent based on a verbatim copy of my design).2. Alexander Frolov, Faraday Labs, St. Petersburg, Russia, claiming anefficiency of over 200%, using an A.C.-heated tungsten filament.(http:/faraday.ru).3. Jean-Louis Naudin, Paris, over 2,100% effocoemcu isomg a 50 Hz. D.C. pulse(created from Eurpoean 50 Hz. House current).4. Italians, Andrea Rossi and Sergio Focardi---the “Rossi-Focardi LENRDevice”---based on the Lyne Atomic Hydrogen Furnace, but concealed by adeceptive description and “secrecy”). This was announced Jan. 14, 2011, fromBologna, Italy. Rossi claimed an output of 12,400 Watts with an input of 300Watts (COP of 31).Though Naudin says that his experiment was based on Langmuir’s work, Langmuirnever invented the use of a closed loop system, and never knew that the processwas over-unity, which means his calculations were WRONG. That is my work. I alsoam the first that I know of to design an industrial grade atomic hydrogenfurnace. Naudin used the same unit constructed by Frolov (using a large oldmetallic water-cooled rectifier tube) with a slight alteration of thedissociation current (from a conventional electrically-heated tungstenfilament). Both Frolov and Naudin mention a Danish man named Nicholas Moller whoplagiarized my work and my design and misrepresented to Frolov that it was hiswork. Frolov corrected this fraud.Andrea Rossi copied my invention with minor variations. He dissociates the H2 toH1 then reacts it in a stainless steel chamber packed with nickel powder aroundwhich a water jacket removes the heat and converts water to low pressure wetsteam. Then he recirculates the hydrogen circuitously as in my invention to berepeated ad infinitum . There is a difference in design but in effect nodifference in concept.The dissociation method used by Rossi---Nichrome® resistance heatingwires---after which the H1 is injected into the reaction chamber packed withnickel power, provides the environment which effects the recombination of the H1to H2 with release of heat. This is said by some to produce some nuclearradiation as a result of energyconsuming transmutation of some of the nickel tocopper (ca.10%) and iron (ca.14%), but there is no residual radioactive matter.The reaction chamber has a surrounding water jacket through which water iscirculated to remove the heat and generate low pressure wet steam. The nickelbuffets and lowers the high temperature reaction heat, so the water is ofinsufficient temperature to produce the dry, superheated steam required to powera turbo-electric steam generator. I solved the problem of how to handle theextremely high temperatures years ago but am now holding that secret asproprietary technology.The transmutation effected by Rossi's device is not desirable with this processand is counter-productive, since it diminishes energy output and also leads toconfusion for those who need a conventional explanation. It has also confusedRossi, whose explanation has been rejected because it is a failed attempt tosatisfy conventional physics. Only my “ether and Primary Solar Rays” explanationwill suffice. Scientists must realize that with my invention, I have opened adoor to use of cosmic energy. Until they realize this, they will only continueto prop up a false (relativist) physics, and incidentally continue to supply amarket for uranium and nuclear energy, coal, gas and other fossil fuels.There is a definite deception by Rossi, saying that he “invented” it and that hehas a “secret catalyst” (when in fact, in this case, the catalyst is the“catalytic metal”, nickel). This is shown in my original 1996 drawing as “Activation energy device (spark plug, catalytic metal , etc.)”. The use of acatalytic metal is unnecessary so I apologize for that. Rossi's statement that'there is absolutely no tungsten' in his device (in obvious reference to mydesign) only confirms his prior knowledge of my invention as well as confusionthat my design somehow relies on tungsten, per se (it was recommended only forits high-temperature applications, not for catalysis). Almost any metal willtrigger the recombination of H1 to H2 . Once the reaction is triggered bycontact with metal it will continue so long as H1 is supplied.I have also solved the exact mechanism by which the molecular binding energy iscanceled and resupplied. I have also conceived a unique method for dissociation.But I won't disclose those details here because idea-thieves will only steal andsay they discovered them.My 1996 design is as follows (the encircled part is where Rossi got his“catalytic metal”/“eCat” idea):[Image00013.jpg]With both Langmuir's and Rossi's use of electrical resistance heating wires todissociate the H2 , you have to ask what kind of radiation comes off the wires.I believe that it is not the heat---as Langmuir and Rossi believed---thatdissociates the molecules, but the radiation, which according to Tesla ismechanical sound waves in the ether. These waves tear the H2 molecules apartphysically rather than by heat expansion. (Some have mistakenly described the H1as a “superheated hot gas” which is wrong.) The I.R. radiation is in themicrowave spectrum. Other frequencies may work---some possibly even better---toget maximum effect, the idea being to use as little energy as possible toproduce the greatest effect in the name of efficiency. The invention must alsobe durable and resilient to component fatigue, with minimal maintenance so asnot to break down in the long Winters of Alaska or Sweden, or on asteamturbine-driven ship in the middle of the ocean.The following is a simplified drawing of my re-designed furnace, which does notinclude the secret details of each of the parts shown:[Image00014.gif]A. - AcceleratorB. - DissociatorC. - Reactor/Heat Exchanger D. - H2 Return ConduitE. - Heat Exchange Fluid Pump F. - Hot Fluid Tank (test) G. - Electric InputH. - Watt-hour Meter I. - ThermometerH2 is accelerated by Accelerator A through Dissociator B where it is efficientlyconverted to H1.

Electric Input G Wattageis measured by Watt-hour Meter H and compared to calories measured byThermometer I to determine efficiency ratio.Inclusion of the details would enable the corporate thieves and other fakers todecipher my design, patent it, sell it to the government, and the people mightnever see it. The corporations would be unjustly enriched. A rough conservativeestimate of this single unit's expected output, in a size no more than a cubicmeter including the holding tank, is at least 50 kW net, free energy, and itwill heat a large space or produce superheated dry steam to power aturbo-electric generator for electric power.As of February, 2012, I have no backers, so building is slow on my meager means.Its secrets may die with me whenever I go, unless a fair backer emerges. At thispoint you might say that I am “on strike” like John Galt. But a pocket full ofmoney will induce me to go off strike.Due to changes in our patent laws---“first to file” not “first to invent”---Ihave decided not to open-source the details of my newest design, for then wemight have the spectacle of some copy-cat suppressing me for authorizing the useof my own invention to people at large. The idiots in the Patent Office, intheir infinite wisdom, probably thought this new rule would induce someone likeme to apply for a patent. I do not have the financial resources to do so.The RQM’s misrepresentation of the real potential of this process is herebyunmasked as Orwellian doublethink. Since when is the potential energy of theatom of an element measured from its molecular state, or its atomic state calledits “excited state”? This is exactly like saying that a truck sitting at thebottom of a hill has more “potential energy” than one sitting at the top,because of the energy required to drive it up to the top of the hill! What astrange way to define “potential energy”. It is like saying that an empty gascan has the potential energy of the gas that it takes to fill it up!The unique thing about the hydrogen atom, is that it is “born” at the top of thehill! Its astounding properties lie in its ability to perform as a “doorway”between the ether, Primary Solar Rays and the world of more familiar atomicmatter.The relativist statements have been unwittingly accepted as correct, becausethere is no ether or Primary Solar Rays possible under their theories, and themolecules have to have more energy than the atoms separately, because “E = MC2”. The RQMs have misrepresented and concealed this process in which separateatoms— with lower MASS—possess more “atomic” energy than the molecules!. Thesefacts on hydrogen show that E equals MUCH MORE THAN MC2 .Under relativism “solid” matter is thought erroneously to be the most “compact”,“stored” form of “atomic energy”, because the energy is supposed to be releasedfrom mass by the “smashing” and destruction, or fusing together of atoms, whichTesla said was false. It is clearly shown by the Lyne Atomic Hydrogen Furnacethat Tesla was right and the relativists and Einstein were wrong, because thehydrogen atoms acquire more potential energy between the separate atomic stateand the diatomic molecular state when the atoms recombine and the atoms have toget their energy from an external source. The only other way that the moleculescan release any “potential” energy is through combustion with oxygen, which is amuch lower energy output, and that too may come from the Primary Solar Rays.Tesla said that radioactivity was a reaction of atomic mass with the PrimarySolar Rays, just as the hydrogen atom emits IR radiation. The separate atomsmust convert kinetic energy from the Primary Solar Rays and eject it in the formof sound waves in the ether in the microwave spectrum when recombined. Thisradiation then reacts with matter to produce heat.The perverse “potential energy” fallacy is also a way to confuse the diatomichydrogen molecules with the nascent atomic hydrogen atoms produced bydissociation. The energy of hydrolysis is equated with the energy ofdissociation, and the energy of combustion with the energy of recombination, yetthe information presented here shows that by combining a type of hydrolysis ofwater, in which atomic hydrogen is produced directly, with the atomic hydrogenrecombination process, instead of the combustion process, that at least 10.5times as much energy as the hydrolytic input can be produced, in still a thirdastounding hydrogen free energy process. This is a gain in energy which Langmuirseemed to to have missed and failed to mention. This is true because the atomichydrogen process without question releases at least 3.75 times the BTUs byweight (even by RQM standards), as ordinary hydrogen and oxygen produce in thecombustion process. It is generally agreed that the “energy of combustion”equals at least the “energy of hydrolysis” (even though it is well known thatthe industrial production of hydrogen is generally 120% efficient in theso-called “water-gas” process, in which steam is shot through a white-hotgraphite orifice).Production of atomic hydrogen directly by hydrolysis, eliminating a separatedissociation operation, is yet another exciting possibility. If the 103 cal/gramdissociation energy is correct and the electrolytic energy is recovered bycombustion, there is a theoretical possibility of getting a net 1,058 times theenergy of input in the recombination process.HOW DOES IT WORK?As a “welding process”, this process was allegedly ‘obsolesced’ by MIG and TIGwelding, neither of which can compare to its welding efficiency and uses. Sincethe welding process was its main use in the years past, the “new” processesallowed industry to toss the ‘obsolete” process onto the junk heap. The “new”processes were promoted by the establishment, motivating their suppliers and theelectric power companies at their own levels. More archaic tanks, transformers,gauges, torches, electrodes, gases, fluxes, and electric power, etc., etc., tobe sold at a hefty profit. If people generate their own hydrogen for welding athome, how much equipment, supplies and power will they buy? Is saving money acrime?How does the atomic hydrogen obtain its energy, if not from the “ether” andPrimary Solar Rays? No wonder establishment science doesn’t want you to knowthere is an ether. If we are to believe the “law of conservation of energy” asinterpreted by ether-excluding establishment “science”, this process isimpossible, yet using data available from the ‘standard’ texts, I have shownthat the input energy of 103 cal/gram mole (or however much is required) issomehow ‘magnified’ by use of hydrogen as a ‘medium’ so that the 103 cal/grammole ‘seed’ energy triggers the atomic hydrogen’s apprehension of a net 108,897cal/gram mole from the Primary Solar Rays via the “ether”.I reiterate, an equally phenomenal “atomic helium” process (reported in SpaceAliens) is 4.6 times this caloric output per gram mole. What is theproportionate input? It can be conducted almost the same way, and produces thesame kind of electrical energy and radiation-to-heat energy transformation, inwhich “mass” is only a “medium” used in the process. Similar principles areshared by the Lyne Atomic Hydrogen Furnace, as shown by my illustration at thischapter’s end, and Josef Papp’s noble gas engine61 . If these processes used asmuch electrical energy as they produced, and electrical energy was the endproduct sought, what would be the reason for the process, right? At thecomparable 30 mpg for n-Heptane, helium could produce 42.86 times as much asatomic hydrogen, or about 1285.8 miles per pound. That is, if you used thehelium up, which you don’t.According to the Van Nostrand’s Scientific Encyclopedia62 , simple electronbombardment of helium gas in a special chamber, excites the helium atom to atemporarily radioactive isotope of extremely short half-life. In this state, thehelium atom unpairs its electrons, promotes one electron to the 2s state (inwhich state it remains for only a very short time), and afterward releases460,000 cal/gram mole on collapse of the excited atoms back to their groundstate. This gram of gas molecules occupies only slightly more than a gram moleof atomic hydrogen. It is my belief and theory that the elements in the excitedstate somehow convert the energy of the Primary Solar Rays according to Tesla’stheory of radioactivity.61 61. Josef Papp, Method and Means of Converting Atomic Energy into UtilizableKinetic Energy , Patent # 3,670,494 (June 20, 1972).62 62. supra.Since each hydrogen atom is composed of a proton and an electron, each withequal-and-opposite charge, one would expect the binding force between diatomicmolecules to be very weak, but when the atoms are separated they purportedlyexpand greatly in size, encompassing a greater volume of ether. Onrecombination, the atoms shrink in volume, and according to standard theory,infrared radiation is squeezed out of the atom. The dissociation requires only103 cal/gram mole, yet on recombination, the atoms “exothermically” yield a net108,897 cal/gram mole. How exactly does this occur?All space is packed solid “bumper-to-bumper” with ether. This elusive and ultrafine, absolutely transparent matter is being omnidirectionally interpenetratedby Primary Solar Rays composed of minute particles propelled at high speed bythe enormous forces in stars. These particles must collide with and excite theether held within the atomic space between the proton and the electron cloud,transferring their momentum to the ether and producing sound waves in the etherin the infrared (heat) spectrum, while the minute solar particles themselvesmust be absorbed by the atoms creating new mass or discarded. The increasedmomentum must be carried by the mono-atomic hydrogen atoms until they are openedup on release during recombination into diatomic molecules.The facts suggested here are forbidden by relativity and quantum mechanics, inwhich a simple harmonic oscillator cannot have a stationary state of zerokinetic energy, because the ground state still has one-half quantum of energyand the appropriate motion, yet by relativity’s ‘other’ rules, the principle ofkinetic energy has no applicability to electromagnetic radiation. Sincerelativity also rejects the existence of an ether, there is nothing in so-called“empty space” to contain such radiant energy, and the atomic hydrogen processwould have to create its energy from “nothing”, therefore violating the law ofconservation of energy, as misinterpreted by the relativists who see all energyfunctions as part of the ‘winding down’ products of an “original” BIG BANG andentrained entropy theory.Incidentally, this same atomic hydrogen process, as first published here andnow, is also the apparent source of the anomalous exothermic heat produced inaqueous cavitation, as well as in the socalled “cold fusion” process, which aretwo other free energy processes which I believe are versions of the atomichydrogen process.The atomic hydrogen atoms have single, unpaired electrons in enlarged shells.These atoms are in Mendeleev’s Group I-a, and all the atoms in that group haveunpaired outer electrons, and are photoreactive to and transmute when exposed toultraviolet light, and all of them can be used to convert Primary Solar Raysinto usable free energy. This photo-reactivity creates temporary,artificialradioactivity-produced isotopes of short half-life, with the emissionof radiant energy. But the radioactivity is contained within the atoms. Theenergy for the infrared frequency ether waves comes from the Primary Solar Raysaccording to Tesla, not from the atoms themselves. The atoms can be analogizedby certain crystals, described by the Raman Effect, in which light passingthrough the crystals is “stepped down” to lower frequencies. The infraredspectrum light produced by the atomic hydrogen process is thermally reactivewith normal atomic and molecular matter.The transfer of force from the Primary Solar Rays to the dissociated H1 atoms,is apparently the kind of thing spoken of by Tesla when he stated: “There is noenergy in matter other than that received from the environment.”63In so-called “cold fusion”, the electrolytic cell produces “nascent hydrogen”,with the atomic hydrogen process, and the recombination of the mono-atomichydrogen to H2 releases overunity heat, the product claimed. My process alsoproves Tesla’s theory that atomic energy comes from the environment. It provesthat “mass” does not even enter into the equation, and that Einstein’s “E = MC2”is wrong. Einstein’s theory says this process as I describe it could only bepossible if the hydrogen were ‘annihilated’, converting its “mass” into heat,and otherwise, is impossible. But the hydrogen is still hydrogen, and Einsteinwas still wrong. It defies relativism and the BIG BANG.Perhaps this or a similar process was also what Leland Anderson referred to inhis eulogy of Tesla, when he mentioned his “plucking” thermal units “...rightout of the thin air”. After all, the hydrogen atoms when in the H2 molecularform are smaller, therefore “compressed”. Compression of a gas releases heatradiation, usually thought to originate with the energy endothermically absorbedduring decompression, which is backward from the gas dynamics. So in this casethe question is “Where did the heat come from and exactly how much does itproduce?”63 63. Nikola Tesla, Lecture Before the Institute of Immigrant Welfare (May 12,1938).In the case of hydrogen, the change is effected by the natural, physical processof recombination to H2 . According to standard theory, the molecular atoms canbe ‘decompressed’ by application of “the heat of dissociation”, because thestrong binding force between the atoms is supposedly weakened by an amount ofexothermic energy sufficient to separate the atoms, which is exactly the amountregained when the atoms are recombined.Hydrogen atoms have the highest charge-to-mass ratio known, a ratio which almostcompletely neutralizes the protons. ‘Decompression’ of the electron cloudsoccurs during dissociation. As the protons dissociate with application of the103 cal/gram mole, this allows the greatly expanded electron clouds of the atomsto encompass a larger volume of space, from which a net 108,897 cal/gram molecan be extracted from the only sources available, the Primary Solar Rays and theether. Since there is no great cooling activity in the proximate area ofdissociation, the ‘heat’ can only come from a conversion of environmentalradiation, else there would be the formation of ice, etc. This process, thoughit can be thermally set up and triggered by electrons, is not merely a thermalprocess, because the net energy released is converted originally from kineticenergy, while the relativists have no plausible answer.The raw data for this process came from ordinary science books. The fullmagnitude and output comparable to petroleum was only obviated by conversion ofweights, measures, and temperature units, to produce a consistent picture and toobtain the total net outputs. Most physicists or chemists would refuse tobelieve the results, even if they had calculated them themselves, and wouldinsist that they had erred. This is indeed an inverted BIG LIE which is toldvery small and often. The lie consists of a denial that there is an ether, thedistortion of quantum mechanics, and the exaggeration of or minimizing of otherincompatible measurements, to create a false overall picture. This is thenbacked up by a vacuum of information in texts and other sources available to thepublic, created via the National Security Act, at the behest of the Fuel/PowerCartels.APPROPRIATE USE OF THE PROCESSWith an understanding of the atomic hydrogen process, and the great magnitude ofits output, what are its most immediately applicable uses?The most direct, appropriate use of this technology appears to be to provideheat for homes, as well as for home-industrial or industrial heating purposes,or for agricultural heat production. A secondary use would be to produce heatfor steam to drive turbinepowered electric generators or for motive power forcars, trucks, boats, trains and planes. This system would be excellent ifcoupled with refrigerant-driven, closed-loop turbo-electric generators, toprovide electric power for electro-propulsive flying saucers, the ultimate inprivate transportation.Since the net output is heat, the first order of business is a special heatexchanger, to transfer heat to water or other media, or to produce steam forturbine power. The heat in the reaction chamber of the atomic hydrogen furnacemust be quickly removed by the exchanger to prevent a buildup of heat sufficientto melt the reactor surfaces which receive and catalyze the recombining gasatoms. The simplified design shown is merely a proposal which I presented toprospective backers without disclosing the true details.Years ago, German metallurgists used atomic hydrogen in a copper crucible,creating a “hydrogen environment” to reduce platinum group metals from theircompounds. To resist the high temperatures required for the reductions, thecopper crucible was cooled from below by water, which removed the heat fastenough to prevent melting of the copper, as platinum metals were melted in itwith the torch from above. The occlusion of oxygen prevented oxidation of thecrucible and the platinum metals, and insured reduction of the platinumcompounds by the hydrogen. This idea, together with over 45 years familiarityand used of the pyrotechnology and over 34 years of welding has influenced thedesign of my atomic hydrogen furnace. The following is a simplified graphicshowing the proposed circuitous cycle of the hydrogen atoms:[Image00015.jpg]At “1\" above is the diatomic hydrogen molecule H2 , with more tightly boundelectrons. At “2\" are the dissociated hydrogen atoms, H1 , separated due to theintroduction of dissociating energy which can come in several forms. At “3\" arethe recombined atoms, with the emission of I.R. frequency sound waves in theether as the electron clouds shrink. The entry into the process by the PrimarySolar Rays is indicated by “PSR”.CONCLUSIONS196,200 BTUs is a lot of energy from a pound of hydrogen. I have to pinchmyself. Then repeat it many times. And this is only the tip of the iceberg.Soon after this kind of “atomic energy” hit a small segment of the unknowingAmerican public—the welders—in the late ‘40s, there were newspaper storiessaying that the trans-Atlantic voyages of the Queen Mary could be powered by ahunk of radioactive material the size of a golf ball. They exaggerated theirstories that way when the nuclear industry wanted us to get hooked and pay forit, but today’s “nuclear reactors” produce electricity at the same efficiencylevel as coal and gas-fired generators (38%), and we still have to deal with theinevitable problems of greater expense, entrenched, archaic, stagnant “nuclear”and fossil fuel technology, nuclear decay, waste, and probable devastation likeCernobyl.The stumbling blocks to the use of hydrogen are actually illusions, created bythe corporate-state coercive monopolists. The atomic hydrogen effect wasdiscovered in 1912 by Langmuir, and was developed only as a “welding process” inthe ‘30s. The DOE ‘scientists’ at Los Alamos said the use of hydrogen involvedheavy, cumbersome cryogenic tanks and equipment, until a liquid hydride systemwas developed by Dr. Gerald Schafflander of California, and was pointed out byme in a letter to the New Mexican newspaper in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1980,totally ridiculing their phony efforts in 1979. Then Schafflander and associateswere prosecuted by the SEC—because the liquid hydride stored hydrogen insomething like “rock salt”—which cracked out at about 70° C. (The SEC presentedthis as incredulous, I don’t.) DOE scientists mention only the heavier, morecumbersome, solid metallic hydride systems. Schafflander’s lighter liquidhydride system, which used solarvoltaics to generate the hydrogen, would be awonderful way to store and deliver hydrogen for the atomic hydrogen process.Goodbye oil cartels, hello atomic hydrogen, it’s pay-back time!By the way, the reason my “cold fusion” process (using my weird lead-basedcathode) which I tested back in 1980, worked so well was because Langmuir, backin 1912, said his lead amalgam cathode produced “nascent” (atomic) hydrogendirectly. Cold fusionists, throw away your palladium cathodes and get leadamalgam! Watch the price of water rise to $4.00 per gallon. After all, whyshould “they” allow “us” to buy a whole gallon of pure H2O “chemicals” for less,especially when a gallon is enough for a lifetime?If the energy of hydrolysis produces approximately the same heat energy as thatrecovered by combustion, and dissociated hydrogen atoms can be produced directlyby hydrolysis, this process with the furnace has to be free energy.William Lyne was born in Big Spring, Texas in 1938 and was raised in West Texasoil boom towns, with two years as a child in the Bay Area of Northern Californiaduring WW II, and the southeast Big Thicket country of Texas.
