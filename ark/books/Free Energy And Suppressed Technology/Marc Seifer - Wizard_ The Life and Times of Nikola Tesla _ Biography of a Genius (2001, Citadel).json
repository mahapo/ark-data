SEIFERpublisher logo [images/logo.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"In memory of my Dad, Stanley Seifer"},{"pageContent":"FOREWORD [002-toc.html#foreword]Nikola Tesla was my father’s uncle, and as such he was treated by our familymuch as any uncle might have been who lived at a considerable distance and wasadvanced in years. But there were stronger bonds between my father and Teslathan might otherwise have been the case. They came from identical socialbackgrounds, sons of Serbian Orthodox priests, born and raised a few miles apartin the Austro-Hungarian military frontier district county of Lika in theProvince of Croatia (my grandmother was Tesla’s sister Angelina); they were theonly members of a relatively limited extended family to emigrate to America; andthey were the only members to undertake science and technology as their life’swork.My father, Nicholas J. (John) Terbo (Nikola Jovo Trbojevich), was thirty yearsyounger than his uncle, came to America thirty years after him, and died thirtyyears after Tesla. Tesla was already famous as my father was growing up, and hebecame a model for my father’s technical career. Father held about 175 U.S. andforeign patents, the most important of which was his 1923 basic patent on theHypoid gear, used on the vast majority of the world’s cars since 1930. TheHypoid gear introduced advanced mathematics to the art of gear design, much asTesla’s work united electrical theory and electrical engineering. Teslahenceforth proudly referred to my father as “my nephew, the mathematician.”(That these patents brought considerable financial as well as professionalrecognition to my father was also not lost on the often cash-poor Tesla.)Because the ethnic and professional similarities between Nikola Tesla and myfather were so striking, I feel that I have been granted a special privilegethrough this comparison in understanding Tesla’s private personality, includinghis well-developed sense of humor and his often cavalier disregard for money.Once, when Tesla was visiting us in the early 1930s, my father took him to lunchat the Book Cadillac Hotel, then the finest in Detroit. They arrived late, onlya few minutes before a cover charge of $2 or $3 would end. (This was equivalentto $20 or $30 by today’s standards.) My father suggested waiting, but Teslawould hear none of it. They sat down amid a flurry of waiters and Tesla ordereda chafing dish, bread, and milk and proceeded to prepare his own lunch to hisown specifications (to my father’s amusement and the unease of the maître d’).I had not yet reached thirteen when Tesla died in January 1943, and I did nothave the sense of the ending of an epoch marked by his passing, both for ourfamily and for an era of individualism in scientific discovery.I may have reflected with some uneasiness that I had had the opportunity to meetTesla some three or four years earlier and that no further meetings would everhappen again. I remembered my reluctance to be dragged to the meeting in hissuite at the Hotel New Yorker when my mother and I were spending a few days inNew York before returning to Detroit after our summer vacation at the Jerseyshore. (I would have preferred spending more time at Radio City Music Hall or atthe docks, watching the ocean liners.)I was shy (rather, overwhelmed) and spoke hardly a word to this very tall, verygaunt old man. I would have been repelled—as any young “all-American boy” shouldhave been—to be hugged and kissed by this stranger if my father hadn’t oftendone the same. (This is the way my mother’s women friends often acted, but myAmerican mother’s brother would have only given me a firm handshake.) Little didI realize that Tesla’s hugging, kissing, and patting my head would belie hisfamous idiosyncrasy of an overriding phobia of germs. Surely, a young boy wouldhave been teeming with “germs”! One could therefore speculate that this“idiosyncrasy” was possibly an affectation designed to preserve his “space.”While Tesla lived, some considerable degree of his fame endured—in no smallmeasure because of his ability to stimulate the media. However, after his deaththe nation and the world were occupied with other more pressing matters—war andreconstruction, international political realignments, an unmatched explosion ofnew technology, a new consumer society—and Tesla’s fame and recognition nearlyevaporated. Only a few in the U.S. and international scientific communities andthe abiding respect and admiration of Serbs and all Yugoslavs worldwide kept hisname alive.My awareness of a resurgence of interest in the life and works of Nikola Teslabegan in the early 1970s, when I moved from Los Angeles (where it seemed no onehad ever heard of Tesla) to Washington, D.C., where at least the name wasrecognized. In February 1975 my mother phoned to tell me that she had read inthe Los Angeles Times that Uncle Nikola was to be inducted into the NationalInventors Hall of Fame and that I should look into it. I chanced to notice on alocal TV news program that evening a short segment monitoring the Hall of Fameand an interview with a girl of ten or twelve who had invented a new can openeror some such. I dismissed the Hall as a commercial promotion and went on tosomething else.Only later did I read a newspaper account about the induction of Tesla (alongwith Orville and Wilbur Wright, Samuel F. B. Morse, and Tesla’s nemesis,Guglielmo Marconi) and citing the Hall’s sponsorship by the U.S. Department ofCommerce’s Patent and Trademark Office. The closest living relative of eachhonoree was to receive the induction diploma at an elaborate ceremony. Lackingany “Tesla” (or even any “Trbojevich”) to represent the family, an officer ofthe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) accepted the Tesladiploma. (The IEEE considers Tesla one of the twelve “apostles” of electricalscience and continues to offer an annual prize in the field of Power Engineeringin his name.) When I presented myself at the Patent Office a few weeks later,they were delighted and made arrangements to make a second presentation to me atthe 1976 awards ceremony held that year at Congress Hall in Philadelphia as partof the U.S. Bicentennial Year celebration.Since then, there has been an earnest revival of interest in the technologicalaccomplishments of Nikola Tesla and in his personality, philosophy, and cultureas well. Part of the drama of his life is that he was a man who not onlyrevolutionized the generation and distribution of electrical energy and madebasic contributions to many other facets of modern technology but that he did sowithout the specific aim of amassing great wealth. This altruism, which is oftencriticized as “poor business sense,” imposed a monetary limitation on futureexperimentation to test his new innovations. Who knows what advances might havebeen possible if he had been able to validate them through rigorousexperimentation. New science is an expensive endeavor, and finding financialsupport is a frustrating task for even those as focused as Tesla.Among the associations that have supported the Tesla renaissance are: the TeslaMemorial Society, which I helped found in 1979, and of which I am pleased to beits Honorary Chairman and Chairman of its Executive Board, and the InternationalTesla Society, founded in 1983, and of which I am a Life Member. It was whilespeaking at the first ITS biannual Tesla Symposium in 1984 that I first met afellow speaker, Dr. Marc J. Seifer, in person. His paper “The Lost Wizard” wasthe seed from which his new Tesla biography has sprung. I have been impressedwith Dr. Seifer’s dedication and scholarship in developing his early theoriesinto a well-rounded examination of the mystery of Tesla’s great genius.One of the things that has most intrigued me about a new work on this topic ishow much new information keeps surfacing. Dr. Seifer has researched minorcharacters in Tesla’s life as well as the many major ones. This has given himadditional insight into Tesla’s life and allowed the development of new anddifferent interpretations of many important events, such as the failure of theWardenclyffe tower project.Dr. Seifer provides a new look at Tesla’s college years, the time when many ofhis epochal ideas were forming. He has uncovered new information on Tesla’srelationship with a number of key individuals, such as his editor, ThomasCommerford Martin, and financial backers John Jacob Astor and John Hays Hammond.A great strength of Wizard is its adherence, chapter by chapter, to a ratherstrict chronology, which makes it easy to follow the breadth and scope ofTesla’s life and achievements in an orderly fashion.I congratulate Dr. Seifer on a decade’s journey with Nikola Tesla and am pleasedto introduce to you Wizard.William H. TerboHonorary Chairman Tesla Memorial Society"},{"pageContent":"PREFACE [002-toc.html#preface]In 1976, while involved in research at the New York Public Library, I stumbledupon a strange text entitled Return of the Dove which claimed that there was aman not born of this planet who landed as a baby in the mountains of Croatia in1856. Raised by “earth parents,” an avatar had arrived for the sole purpose ofinaugurating the New Age. By providing humans with a veritable cornucopia ofinventions, he had created, in essence, the technological backbone of the modernera.1His name was Nikola Tesla, and his inventions included the induction motor, theelectrical-power distribution system, fluorescent and neon lights, wirelesscommunication, remote control, and robotics.Tesla—who’s he? I said to myself. Because my father had been a TV repairman forseveral years in the early 1950s and I had spent part of my childhoodaccompanying him on house calls, helping put up antennas, test and buy radiotubes, play with oscilloscopes, and watch him build TVs, I was amazed that I hadnever heard of this man.I remember vividly an event from my grade-school years on Long Island thatprepared me for my latter-day interest. It was a Saturday, circa 1959, and I wasworking on a Boy Scout assignment when I came upon a design for a crystal radioset. My father and I gathered a glass jar and a set of headphones, a crystaldetector for changing the ambient AC radio waves into audio DC pulses, some thincopper wire to be wrapped around the jar, a metal switch that was scraped acrossthis coil for the “dial,” a small plank to hold the contraption together, and ahundred feet of normal rubbercoated wire for the antenna, which we strung out asecond-story window. There was no plug; all energy was derived from thebroadcast signals from the nearby radio stations. However, after hooking it alltogether, the reception was faint; I became discouraged.My father paced the room, considering the problem, muttering, “Something’swrong.” After a few moments of deep thought, he made a motion which said, “I’vegot it.” Walking over to our radiator and dragging another wire, which he hadhooked up to the jar, Dad attached a ground connection. Suddenly, all thestations began to come in loud and clear, and I marked each of them on the jaralong the coil. It was apparent to me then that electrical power was beingtransmitted from these stations by wireless means and that the earth somehow wasintrinsically linked to this system.And now, here I was, nearly twenty years later, two years out of graduate schoolwith a master’s degree, well-read and somewhat knowledgeable about electronics,yet I had never heard of the principal inventor of the very device I had spentendless hours with as a kid. This astonished me in a way difficult to describe.Moreover, when I asked my father about Tesla, he barely knew of him.Because I believe in seeking original sources, I began to research Tesla’s life,starting with the two existing biographies, John O’Neill’s classic ProdigalGenius and Inez Hunt and Wanetta Draper’s Lightning in His Hand. Soon after, Ibegan tracking down numerous turn-of-the-century references and also the weightyNikola Tesla: Lectures, Patents, Articles, produced by the Tesla Museum inBelgrade, Yugoslavia. Thus, I was able to ascertain, by following his actualpatents, that indeed Tesla existed and that his work was fundamental to allthese creations.That Tesla’s name was so little known puzzled me, so in 1980, three years afterwriting my first article on him, I began a doctoral dissertation on his life. Mymajor purpose was to address the question of name obscurity.During the writing of my dissertation, several notable Tesla works werecompiled. These included the comprehensive and encyclopedic Dr. Nikola TeslaBibliography, by Leland Anderson and John Ratzlaff; Tesla’s 1919 autobiography,republished by Hart Brothers; Margaret Cheney’s biography Tesla: Man Out ofTime; two compendiums of Tesla’s writings by John Ratzlaff; Colorado SpringsNotes, produced by the Tesla Museum; and most recently, Leland Anderson’sedition of Tesla’s private testimony to his lawyers on the history of wirelesscommunication.Even with all this new material, however, no comprehensive, all-embracingtreatise had been achieved. In fact, after studying all these texts, a number ofcontradictions and glaring mysteries remained. These included not only Tesla’sobscure early years, tenure at college, and relationship to such key people asThomas Edison, Guglielmo Marconi, George Westinghouse, and J. P. Morgan but alsothe worth of Tesla’s accomplishments and his exact place in the development ofthese inventions.This book attempts to solve the mysteries. Because there have been significantgaps in the record, a clear chronology of Tesla’s life is presented. Alsoaddressed are such issues as why his name dropped into obscurity after being apage 1 subject in newspapers around the world at the turn of the century, why henever received the Nobel Prize, even though he was nominated for one, what Tesladid during the world wars, and whether his plan for transmitting electricalpower by wireless was feasible.Using a psychohistorical perspective, the text discusses not only those factorsthat led to Tesla’s genius, but also quirks that led to his undoing. In thisvein, it delineates Tesla’s relationship to many of his well-known associates,such as John Jacob Astor, T. C. Martin, J. P. Morgan Sr. and Jr., John HaysHammond Sr. and Jr., Michael Pupin, Stanford White, Mark Twain, Rudyard Kipling,Franklin Delano Roosevelt, George Sylvester Viereck, Titus deBobula, and J.Edgar Hoover. Many of these people are barely touched upon or are not discussedat all in other treatises.Because Tesla’s life is so controversial and complex, I also examine suchquestions as whether Tesla received impulses from outer space, why he ultimatelyfailed in his partnership with J. P. Morgan in constructing a multifunctionalglobal wireless system for distributing power and information, what his exactrelationship to Robert and Katharine Johnson was, and what exactly happened tohis particle-beam weaponry system and secret papers. Since I’ve based the textlargely on firsthand documents rather than on the existing biographies, thisbook offers an essentially new view of Tesla’s life. The most recent biography,Tesla, by Tad Wise, an admittedly fictionalized version of the inventor’s life,was not referred to herein, as the goal of the enclosed is to separate out themyth and uncover who Tesla really was. However, one of Wise’s most prominentstories, that Tesla was responsible for the peculiar explosion that devastatedTunguska, Siberia in June of 1908, is addressed in a new appendix for thissecond edition.I have visited all major Tesla archival centers such as at the SmithsonianInstitution in Washington, D.C.; Columbia University, in New York City; and theTesla Museum, in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. And because I have also utilized theFreedom of Information Act and accessed the arcane network of Tesla researchers,I have been able to compile hundreds of documents that have never been discussedbefore by any Tesla biographies. In addition, because I am a handwritinganalyst, I have also utilized that expertise to analyze a number of the keypersonalities involved. Through this means, and as a total surprise, I have alsobeen able to discover a heretofore unreported emotional collapse that theinventor suffered in 1906, at the time of the failing of his great wirelessenterprise.Since Tesla lived until the age of eighty-six, the story spans nearly a century.Revered as a demigod by some in the New Age community, Tesla has, at the sametime, been relegated to virtual nonperson status by influential segments of thecorporate and academic communities. Often billed as a wizard from another worldwho drew thunderbolts from the skies, Tesla himself helped support thesupernatural persona by comparing himself to the Almighty and by frequentlygrabbing headlines with his sensational talk of interplanetary communication.Because his accomplishments are prodigious, fundamental, and documented, theelimination of his name from many history books is not forgivable. Only byunderstanding why this occurred can we, as a modern people, hope to rectify thehistorical record for future generations.Curiously, the further away we have moved from Tesla’s death, the more materialon his life has come to the fore. In particular, we must thank John O’Neill, theTesla Memorial Society, the Tesla Museum in Belgrade, and the InternationalTesla Society (ITS) for this occurrence and the many Tesla researchers who havewritten so much about him of late and have participated in the various ITSconferences held every other year, since 1984, at the site of some of his mostspectacular experiments, in Colorado Springs.Because Tesla’s eye was always on the future, it seems appropriate to concludethis introduction with the opening lines from his autobiography. They are astrue today as we enter the twenty-first century as they were three generationsago, when they were written:> The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is> the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the> complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces> of nature to human needs.

TheSerbian family resided in the province of Lika, a plateau and gentle rivervalley in Croatia where wild boar and deer still dwell and farmers still travelon ox-drawn wagons. Only a cart ride from the Adriatic, the land is wellprotected from invasion by sea, by the Velebit ridge to the west, which runs thelength of the province and towers over the coastline as a steep cliff, and bythe Dinaric Alps to the east, a chain of mountains that emerge from Austria,span the Balkan peninsula and culminate in the south as the isle of Crete.Though hidden, Smiljan was centrally located, fifteen miles east of the tinyseaport of Karlobag, six miles west of the bustling town of Gospić andforty-five miles southwest of the cascading wonder known as Plitvice Lakes, aninterlinking chasm of caves and streams and magnificent waterfalls that lie atthe base of the Dinaric chain.2In the early 1800s, having been briefly part of Napoleon’s Illyrian provinces,Croatia was now a domain of Austria-Hungary. With its neighboring Slaviccountries of Bosnia, Hercegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia, Croatia wassandwiched between the ruling Hapsburg dynasty to the north and the OttomanEmpire to the south.In ancient times, and for many centuries, much of the coastline along theAdriatic was ruled by the Illyrians, a piratical tribe believed to havedescended from regions around Austria. Successfully protecting their bordersfrom such rulers as Alexander the Great, many Illyrians rose into socialprominence; some, at the time of Christ, became emperors.Slavs, traveling in close-knit clans known as zadrugas, were first recognized bythe Byzantines in the second century A.D. in the areas around what is nowBelgrade. Tesla’s appearance resembled the characteristic features of the Ghegs,a tribe described as being tall and having convex-shaped noses and flat skulls.Like other Slavs, these people were originally pagans and worshiped naturespirits and a god of thunder and lightning. Tesla’s early ancestors wereprobably born in the Ukraine. They most likely traveled down through Romaniainto Serbia and lived near Belgrade, along the Danube. After the Battle ofKosovo in the latter part of the fourteenth century, they crossed the Kosovoplains into Montenegro and continued their migration northward into Croatia inthe latter part of the eighteenth century.3All Slavs speak the same language. The major distinction between Croats andSerbs stems from the differences in the histories of their respective countries.The Croats adopted the pope as their spiritual leader and followed the Romanform of Catholicism; the Serbs adopted a Byzantine patriarch and the GreekOrthodox view. Whereas Roman priests remain celibate, Greek Orthodox priests maymarry.In the east and central regions Slavs were more successful in maintaining theirown control over what came to be called the kingdom of Serbia; whereas in thewest, in Croatia, outside rulers, such as Charlemagne in A.D. 800, occupied theregion. While Croatia maintained the Christianization policies of the Franks,the Serbs and Bulgarians drove out the papacy and revived their own pagan faith,which included animal sacrifice and pantheism. Many of the ancient pagan godswere made saints and were celebrated in higher esteem than Jesus. Tesla’s patronsaint Nicholas was a fourth-century god who protected sailors.4To further alienate the two groups, although speaking the same verbal language,Croats adopted the Latin alphabet, whereas Serbs and Bulgarians took on theCyrillic alphabet used by the Greek Orthodox church.5Before Turkish rule, from the ninth century until the 1300s, Serbia hadmaintained autonomy. For Serbia, this period was its golden age, as theByzantines accepted its autonomous status. Due to the philanthropic nature ofits kings, a dynamic medieval art flourished, and great monasteries wereerected.6Croatia, on the other hand, was in much more turmoil. Influenced by westernEurope, the ruling class attempted unsuccessfully to institute a feudal systemof lords and serfs. This policy directly opposed the inherent structure of thedemocratic zadrugas, and so Croatia was never able to establish a unifiedidentity. Nevertheless, one independent offshoot of Croatia, Ragusa (Dubrovnik),which had established itself as a port of commerce and a rival of Venice as amajor sea power, became a melting pot for south Slavic culture and a symbol forthe Illyrian ideal of a unified Yugoslavia.The identity of Serbia as a nation, however, changed for all time on June 15,1389, the day 30,000 Turks obliterated the Serbian nation in the Battle ofKosovo. Cruel conquerors, the Turks destroyed Serbian churches or converted themto mosques. Drafting the healthiest male children into their armies, theyskewered and tortured the men and forced the women to convert and marry Turks.Many Serbs fled, taking up residence in the craggy mountains of Montenegro orthe hidden valleys of Croatia. Some of those that remained became wealthy asTurkish vassals; others, mostly of mixed blood, became pariahs.The Battle of Kosovo is as important to the Serbs as the Exodus to the Jews orthe Crucifixion to the Christians. It is commemorated every year on theanniversary of the tragedy as Vidov Dan, the day “when we shall see.”7 As oneSerb told the author, “It follows us always.”8 The massacre and ensuingdefilement of the kingdom became the dominant motif of the great epic poemswhich served to unify the identity of the Serbian people through their centuriesof hardship.Unlike the Croats, who did not have this kind of all-embracing exigency, theSerbs had Kosovo. Combined with their adherence to the Greek Orthodox religionin a twofold way, Serbs, no matter where they lived, felt united.The century of Tesla’s birth was marked by the rise of Napoleon. In 1809 theemperor wrested Croatia from Austro-Hungarian rule and established Frenchoccupation. Extending his domain down the Adriatic coast, Napoleon reunited theIllyrian provinces and introduced French libertarian ideals. This philosophyhelped dismantle the outmoded feudal system of lords and serfs and reawaken theidea of a unified Balkan nation. At the same time, the occupation created anidentity with the French culture. Tesla’s paternal grandfather and maternalgreat-grandfather both served under the French emperor.9With support from the Russians, Serbian bands united in 1804 under theleadership of the flamboyant hog farmer George Petrovich, known as Kara-George(in Turkish, Black George), a man of Montenegrin heritage trained in theAustrian army. However, in 1811, Napoleon invaded Russia; thus, support forSerbia evaporated.Forty thousand Turks marched against the Serbs, leveling towns and butcheringcitizens. Serbs were often executed by impalement, their writhing bodies linedup along the roads to the city. All males captured above the age of fifteen wereslaughtered, and women and children were sold as slaves. Kara-George fled thecountry.Milosh, the new Serbian leader, was a sly and treacherous character, able towalk a thin line between Serbs and the sultan. In 1817, when Kara-Georgereturned, he was decapitated, his head sent by Milosh to Istanbul. A tyrant asterrible as any Turkish pasha, Milosh became the official head of Serbia in1830.One of the more sapient figures of the day was the scholar and Serb VukKaradjich (1787-1864). Schooled in Vienna and St. Petersburg, Vuk believed “allYugoslavs were one.”10Pleading with Milosh to build schools and to form a constitution, Vuk created,with a student, a Serbo-Croatian dictionary that combined the two writtenlanguages. He published the epic folk ballads, which gained the attention ofGoethe, and through this means the Serbian plight and also its unique literaturewere translated and spread to the western world.11In Croatia, the land of Tesla’s birth, Emperor Ferdinand of Austria, in 1843,issued a proclamation forbidding any discussion about Illyrianism, therebyhelping keep the Serbs and Croats a separate people. In 1867 theAustro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy was created, and Croatia became a semiautonomousprovince of the new empire. Simultaneously, in Serbia, Michael Obrenovich wasfinally able to “secure the departure…of the Turkish garrisons from Belgrade”and convert the state into a constitutional monarchy.Tesla’s background was thus a mixture of crossed influences, a monasticenvironment, a Byzantine legacy of a once great culture, and incessant battlesagainst barbarous invaders. As a Serb growing up in Croatia, Tesla inherited arich mix of tribal rituals, egalitarian rule, a modified form of Greek OrthodoxCatholicism, pantheistic beliefs, and myriad superstitions. Women cloaked theirbodies in black garb, and men packed a cross in one pocket and a weapon inanother. Living at the edge of civilization, Serbs saw themselves as protectorsof Europe from the Asian hordes. They bore that responsibility with their bloodfor many centuries."},{"pageContent":"2CHILDHOOD (1856-74) [002-toc.html#ch2]> Now, I must tell you of a strange experience which bore fruit in my later> life.

It was “a trade name like Smith…orCarpenter,” which described a woodworking ax that had a “broad cutting blade atright angles to the handle.”3 Supposedly, the Teslas gained the name becausetheir teeth resembled this instrument.The inventor’s grandfather, also named Nikola Tesla, was born about 1789 andbecame a sergeant in Napoleon’s Illyrian army during the years 1809-13. Likeother Serbs living in Croatia, Nikola Tesla, the elder, was honored by fightingfor an emperor who sought to unify the Balkan states and overthrow theoppressive regime of the Austro-Hungarians. He “came from a region known as themilitary frontier which stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the plains of theDanube including…the province of Lika [where the inventor was born]. Thisso-called ‘corpus separatum’ in the Hapsburg monarchy had its own militaryadministration different from the rest of the country, and therefore [they were]not subjects of the feudal lords.”4 Mostly Serbs, these people were warriorswhose responsibility was to protect the territory from the Turks. And in return,unlike the Croats, Serbs were able to own their own land.Shortly after Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo in 1815, Nikola Tesla married AnaKalinic, the daughter of a prominent officer. After the collapse of Illyria, thegrandfather moved to Gospić, where he and his wife could raise a family in acivilized environment.5On February 3, 1819, Milutin Tesla, the inventor’s father, was born. One of fivechildren, Milutin was educated in a German elementary school, the only oneavailable in Gospić. Like his brother Josip, Milutin tried to follow in hisfather’s footsteps. In his late teens he enrolled in an Austro-Hungarianmilitary academy but rebelled against the trivialities of regimented life. Hewas hypersensitive and dropped out after an officer criticized him for notkeeping his brass buttons polished.6Whereas Josip became an officer and later a professor of mathematics, first inGospić and then at a military academy in Austria,7 Milutin became politicallyactive, wrote poetry, and entered the priesthood. Influenced by the philosopherVuk Karadjich, Milutin promulgated the “Yugoslav idea” in editorials publishedin the local newspapers under the nom de plume Srbin Pravicich, “Man ofJustice.” Tesla wrote that his father’s “style of writing was muchadmired…pen[ning] sentences…full of wit and satire.” He called for socialequality among peoples, the need for compulsory education for children, and thecreation of Serbian schools in Croatia.8Through these articles, Milutin attracted the attention of the intellectualelite. In 1847 he married Djouka Mandić, a daughter from one of the moreprominent Serbian families.9Djouka’s maternal grandfather was Toma Budisavljevic (1777-1840), a regal,white-bearded priest who was decorated with the French Medal of Honor byNapoleon himself in 1811 for providing leadership during the French occupationof Croatia. Soka Budisavljevic, one of Toma’s seven children, followed thefamily tradition by marrying a Serbian minister, Nikola Mandić, who himself camefrom a distinguished clerical and military family. Their daughter, Djouka, whowas born in 1821, was Tesla’s mother.10Eldest daughter of eight children, Djouka’s duties increased rapidly, for hermother was stricken with failing eyesight and eventually became blind.“My mother…was a truly great woman of rare skill and courage,” Tesla wrote.Probably due to the magnitude of her responsibilities, which included, at agesixteen, preparing for burial the bodies of an entire family stricken withcholera, Djouka never learned to read. Instead, she memorized the great epicSerbian poems and also long passages of the Bible.11Tesla could trace his lineage to a segment of the “educated aristocracy” of theSerbian community. On both sides of the family and for generations there couldbe found clerical and military leaders, many of whom achieved multipledoctorates. One of Djouka’s brothers, Pajo Mandić, was a field marshal in theimperial Austro-Hungarian army. Another Mandić ran an Austrian militaryacademy.12Petar Mandić, a third brother and later favorite uncle of Nikola’s, met withtragedy as a young man when his wife passed away. In 1850, Petar entered theGomirje Monastery, where he rose in the clerical hierarchy to become theregional bishop of Bosnia.13In 1848, through the help of the Mandić name, Milutin Tesla obtained a parish atSenj,14 a northern coastal fortress located just seventy-five miles from theItalian port of Trieste. From the stone church, situated high on austere cliffs,Milutin and his new bride could overlook the blue-green Adriatic Sea and themountainous islands of Krk, Cres, and Rab.For eight years the Teslas lived in Senj, where they sired their first threechildren: Dane (pronounced Dah-nay), born in 1849, the first son, and twodaughters, Angelina, born the following year, who would later become thegrandmother to the current honorary head of the Tesla Memorial Society, WilliamTerbo, and Milka, who followed two years later. As with her other two sistersand like her mother, Milka would eventually marry a Serbian Orthodox priest.Djouka was proud of her son, Dane, who used to sit with the fishermen on theshore and bring back stories of great adventure. Like his younger brother, whowas yet to be born, Dane was endowed with extraordinary powers of eideticimagery.15Due to a profound sermon on the subject of “labor,” as a result of which Milutinwas awarded a special red sash by the archbishop, the minister was promoted to acongregation of forty homes in the pastoral farming village of Smiljan,16situated only six miles from Gospić. Milutin was returning home, where hisfather still lived. In 1855, the young minister, his pregnant wife, and histhree children packed their oxcart and made the fifty-mile journey over theVelebit ridge through the Lika valley to their new dwelling.In 1856, Nikola Tesla was born. He was followed three years later by Marica,mother-to-be of Sava Kasonovic, the first Yugoslavian ambassador to the UnitedStates, and the man most responsible for creating the Tesla Museum in Belgrade.Smiljan was an ideal setting for the young boys to grow up in. Nikola, raised inlarge measure by his two older sisters, appears to have led an Arcadianchildhood, annoying the servants, playing with the local birds and animals onthe farm, and learning inventions from his older brother and mother.Down to the local creek the boys would go to swim or catch frogs in the springor summer and to build dams in the autumn and early winter in vain attempts tostop the seasonal flooding of the land.17 One of their favorite recreations wasa smooth waterwheel, a device which contained inherent concepts that would laterform the basis of Tesla’s innovative bladeless steam turbines.Other inventions included a cornstalk popgun, which contained principles thatTesla later adapted when he fashioned particle-beam weapons, a special fishinghook for catching frogs, snares for capturing birds, and a parasol used in anunsuccessful attempt to glide off the roof of the barn. Young Niko must havetaken quite a leap, because his fall laid him up for six weeks.18Perhaps the boy’s most ingenious creation was a propeller driven by sixteen Maybugs glued or sewn four abreast onto the wooden blades. “These creatures wereremarkably efficient, for once they were started they had no sense to stop andcontinued whirling for hours and hours…All went well until a strange boy came tothe place. He was the son of a retired officer in the Austrian Army. That urchinate May-bugs alive and enjoyed them as tho [sic] they were the finest blue-pointoysters. That disgusting sight terminated my endeavors in this promising fieldand I have never since been able to touch a May-bug or any other insect for thatmatter.”19Some of the inventor’s earliest memories, when he was three, were recalled whenhe was an octogenarian. Many years before pigeons, Tesla showered his affectionson the family cat, Mačak, “the fountain of my enjoyment…I wish that I could giveyou an adequate idea of the depth of affection which existed between me andhim.”After dinner, Niko and his cat would rush out of the house and frolic by thechurch. Mačak would “grab me by the trousers. He tried hard to make me believehe would bite, but the instant his needle sharp incisors penetrated theclothing, the pressure ceased and their contact with my skin was as gentle andtender as that of a butterfly alighting on a petal.”Tesla liked best to wallow in the grass with Mačak. “We [would] just roll…androll…in a delirium of delight.”In this peaceful setting, young Niko was introduced to the barnyard animals. “Iwould…take one or the other under my arm and hug and pet it,” he wrote,“[especially] the grand resplendent cock who liked me.”20 It was also at thistime that the boy began to study flight, a topic of interest that caused him inlater life to invent a variety of novel flying machines. His relationship withbirds, however, was filled with contradictions.> My childhood…would have passed blissfully if I did not have a powerful> enemy,…our gander, a monstrous ugly brute, with a neck of an ostrich, mouth of> crocodile and a pair of cunning eyes radiating intelligence and understanding> like the human…> > One summer day my mother had given me a bath and put me out for a sun warming> in Adam’s attire.

One, an Aunt Veva, “had two protruding teeth like the tusks of anelephant. She loved me passionately and buried them deep in my cheek in kissingme. I cried out from pain but she thought it was from pleasure and dug them instill deeper. Nevertheless,” Tesla recalled, “I preferred her to the other…[as]she used to glue her lips to mine and suck and suck until by frantic efforts Imanaged to free myself gasping for breath.”One day when they came over and Tesla was still small enough to be held in thearms of his mother, “they asked me who was the prettier of the two. Afterexamining their faces intently, I answered thoughtfully, pointing to one ofthem, ‘This here is not as ugly as the other.’”22Tesla inherited his sense of humor from his father, who, for instance, oncecautioned a cross-eyed employee who was chopping wood near the minister and hisson, “For God’s sake…do not strike at what you are looking at but what youexpect to hit.”Father Tesla was known to talk to himself and even carry on conversations withdifferent tones in his voice, a trait also noted in the inventor, especially inhis later years.23 Milutin also trained his sons in exercises in developingmemory and their intuitive faculties. Able to recite at length works in severallanguages, he often remarked playfully that if some of the classics were lost hecould restore them. “My father…spoke fluently a great many languages and alsoranked high as a mathematician. He was an omnivorous reader and possessed alarge library from which it was my privilege to gather a great deal ofinformation during my years of life spent at home.”24Texts from this library included works in German by Goethe and Schiller,encyclopedic works in French by D’Alembert, and other classics, probably inEnglish, from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.25The inventor’s colorful autobiography remains the primary source of informationon his childhood. Although Dane and his parents appear prominently in the work,Tesla’s sisters are barely mentioned. Certainly he loved the girls—he exchangedletters with them regularly for the duration of his life—but they seemed not tohave overtly influenced his upbringing. It was his mother whose untiring workhabits and proclivity toward invention influenced the inventor-to-be.Whereas Milutin ran the parish and published his articles, Djouka directed theservants and ran the farm. She had the responsibility of growing the crops,sewing all the clothes, and designing needlework, a practice that made herfamous in the region. Tesla also ascribes his proclivity to invention to hismother; she conceived of many household appliances, including churns, looms, and“all kinds of [kitchen] tools. [My mother] descended from a long line ofinventors.” Starting before dawn, she did not quit work until eleven o’clock atnight.26In 1863 disaster struck the Tesla household.27 Dane, who “was gifted to anextraordinary degree,” was out riding the family horse, which was “of Arabianbreed, possest [sic] of almost human intelligence.” The horse may have been thetype easily spooked. The previous winter, it had thrown Milutin in the middle ofthe forest after an encounter with wolves and had run home, leaving himunconscious. The horse, however, was smart enough to bring the search party backto the scene of the accident, and thus the father was saved. This animal, which“was cared for and petted by the whole family,” threw the brother as well, butDane died of the injuries. The family never really recovered. “[Dane’s]premature death left my parents disconsolate…The recollection of his attainmentsmade every effort of mine seem dull in comparison. Anything I did that wascreditable merely caused my parents to feel their loss more keenly. So I grew upwith little confidence in myself.”28Upset by his brother’s death and the rejection by his parents, particularly hismother, the seven-year-old ran away from home and hid in an “inaccessible”mountain chapel which “was visited only once a year.” By the time he had reachedthe place, it was nightfall. There was little the boy could do but force his wayin and spend the night “entombed…It was an awful experience.”29Shortly after this tragedy, Milutin was promoted and given the parish at theornate “onion bulb church” in the town of Gospić.30 The family moved the fewmiles to Gospić, where father Tesla also took a post teaching religion at thelocal gymnasium (high school).31 Niko was of school age, so he began his formaleducation at this time. However, he had great difficulty adjusting to city life,for he missed the farm and the idyllic existence he had once enjoyed. “Thischange of residence was like a calamity to me. It almost broke my heart to partfrom our pigeons, chickens and sheep, and our magnificent flock of geese whichused to rise to the clouds in the morning and return from the feeding grounds atsundown in battle formation, so perfect that it would have put a squadron of thebest aviators of the present day to shame.”32The boy would wake up in the middle of the night with nightmares of Dane’sdeath, which he claimed to have witnessed, and of the funeral, which probablyinvolved an open casket. “A vivid picture of the scene would thrust itselfbefore my eyes and persist despite all efforts to banish it…To free myself ofthese tormenting appearances, I tried to concentrate my mind on somethingelse…[by] continuously [conjuring up] new images…I was opprest [sic] by thoughtsof pain in life and death and religious fear…swayed by superstitious beliefs andlived in constant dread of the spirit of evil, of ghosts and ogres and otherunholy monsters of the dark.”33It was at this time that Tesla began to have what today are known as out-of-bodyexperiences, although he never ascribed anything mystical or paranormal to them.“Blurred [at first]…I would [see]…on my journeys…new places, cities andcountries—live there, meet people and make friendships…and, howeverunbelievable, it is a fact that they were just as dear to me as those in actuallife and not a bit less intense in their manifestations.”34Tesla stated he had such great powers of eidetic imagery that he sometimesneeded one of his sisters to help him tell which was hallucination and which wasnot. Like Dane, his thoughts were often interrupted with annoying flashes oflight. These psychoneurological disturbances continued throughout his life. Onthe positive side, the problem was also attributed to his inventive bent. Hecould use his powers of visualization to mold his various creations, and evenrun and modify them in his mind, before committing them to paper and thematerial world.While still in grade school, Niko had obtained a post at the local library inGospić classifying the various books. But he was forbidden to read at night forfear that his eyes would be strained in dim light, and Milutin “would fly into arage” to stop him.35 Undeterred, Niko would swipe some household candles, sealup the cracks in his room, and continue reading through the night. The book thatTesla claimed changed his life was Abafi, a story, translated into Serbian,about the son of Aba, by the Hungarian author Josika. “Up to the age of eight,my character was weak and vacillating…This work somehow awakened my dormantpowers of will and I began to practice self-control. At first my resolutionsfaded like snow in April, but in a little while I conquered my weakness and felta pleasure I never knew before—that of doing as I willed.”36Thus, by the age of twelve he was successfully experimenting with acts ofself-denial and self-mastery, a paradoxical pattern which played itself outrepeatedly throughout his life. Simultaneously, Tesla began to developpeculiarities, probably stemming from the stress associated with his brother’sdeath, strained relationship with his parents, and denial of his sexualdesires.37 At this time he became ill and claimed that a heavy dose of MarkTwain’s writings turned his spirit and cured him. “Twenty-five years later, whenI met Mr. Clemens and we formed a friendship…I told him of the experience andwas amazed to see that a great man of laughter burst into tears.38 During thisperiod I contracted many strange…habits…I had a violent aversion against theearrings of women but other ornaments, as bracelets, pleased me…The sight of apearl would almost give me a fit but I was fascinated with the glitterof…objects with sharp edges…I would not touch the hair of other people except,perhaps, at the point of a revolver. I would get a fever by looking at apeach…Even now [at age sixty-one] I am not insensible [sic] to some of theseupsetting impulses.”39The youngster, however, also undertook normal boyhood adventures, including afew near-death experiences: on one occasion “by falling headlong into a hugekettle of boiling milk, just drawn from the paternal herds”;40 on anotheroccasion nearly drowning after swimming under a raft; and on a third occasion bynearly being swept over a waterfall at one of the nearby dams. These were ratherunpleasant experiences, but not as bad, according to the inventor, as thefollowing: “There was a wealthy lady in town who used to come to the churchgorgeously painted up and attired with an enormous train and attendants. OneSunday I had just finished ringing the bell in the belfry and rushed downstairswhen this grand dame was sweeping out and I jumped on her train [and] tore it.Livid, my father gave me a gentle slap on the cheek, the only corporalpunishment he ever administered to me but I almost feel it now.”41Niko became ostracized and avoided social interaction. Fortunately, he was ableto redeem himself through his inventive mind. One day, the local firemen broughtout their new engine and started a fire to demonstrate it. To the embarrassmentof the officials, the hose, which drew its water from the local river, would notwork. Intuitively, Tesla realized that there was a kink in the rigging. Tearingoff his Sunday best, he dived into the water, unscrambled the line, and becamethe hero of the day. This event became a strong inducement for the boy tocontinue his interest in invention. Simultaneously, this act symbolized a newway to obtain love and admiration not only from his parents but also fromsociety.Between the ages ten and fourteen, Niko attended the Real Gymnasium, equivalentto junior high school. (It appears that both his father and uncle taught there.)It was a fairly new institution, with a wellequipped physics department. “I wasinterested in electricity almost from the beginning of my educational career,”he wrote. “I read all that I could find on the subject…[and] experimented withbatteries and induction coils.”42Tesla also began experimenting with water turbines and motors that utilizedpower derived from differentials in air pressure. His goal, though unattainabledue to a flaw in his logic, was a perpetual-motion machine that would work bymaintaining a steady-state vacuum and harnessing, like a windmill, the rush ofincoming air. This movement, he hoped, would turn a generator endlessly.After seeing a drawing or photograph of Niagara Falls, Tesla announced to hisUncle Josip that one day he would place a gigantic wheel under the falls andthereby harness it. Most likely, he also visited the magnificent network ofwaterfalls at Plitvice Lakes for additional inspiration, as they were only aday’s journey away.In 1870, at the age of fourteen, Niko moved from Gospić to Karlovac (Carlstadt),where he saw a locomotive for the first time, to attend the Higher RealGymnasium, located by a swamp on a tributary of the Sava River near Zagreb. Theyouth lived with his aunt Stanka, his father’s sister, and her husband, ColonelBrankovic, “an old war-horse.”43During his stay “at Karlovac, he frequently visited his cousin, Milica Zoric, atthe family estate in Tomingaj…[Niko] who would often go there forvacations…[found it to be] a sort of sanctuary…”44At Karlovac he was trained in languages and mathematics. His most influentialprofessor was Martin Sekulic, a physics teacher, who “demonstrated theprinciples by apparatus of his own invention. [It was]…a freely rotatable bulb,with tinfoil coatings, which was made to spin rapidly when connected to a staticmachine. It is impossible for me to convey an adequate idea of the intensity offeeling I experienced in witnessing his exhibitions of these mysteriousphenomena. Every impression produced a thousand echoes in my mind.”45Through hard work, Tesla condensed the four years of schooling into three andbegan to plan a way to approach his father with his controversial decision notto enter the ministry but to study engineering instead. “It is not humans that Ilove, but humanity” he tried to tell his father.During his last year at Karlovac, after a day of exploration by a nearby marsh,he caught a fever which he said was malaria. The seriousness of his conditionmay have been exacerbated by an inadequate diet. “I was fed [by my aunt] like acanary bird…When the Colonel would put something substantial on my plate shewould snatch it away and say excitedly to him: ‘Be careful, Niko is verydelicate.’ I had a voracious appetite and suffered like Tantalus. But I lived inan atmosphere of refinement and artistic taste quite unusual for those times andconditions.”46Upon graduation, Tesla received notice from his father that he should go on ahunting expedition, as there was an epidemic in town. The youth returned toGospić, anyway. The streets were stacked with corpses, the atmosphere thick withsmoke, for the people mistakenly thought that cholera was being transmittedthrough the air rather than by drinking water. Partly due to his weakenedcondition from his earlier illness, Tesla quickly became a victim. Bedridden fornine months, he nearly died. “In one of the sinking spells which was thought tobe the last, my father rushed into the room…‘Perhaps,’ I said, ‘I may get wellif you will let me study engineering.’ ‘You will go to the best technicalinstitution in the world,’ he solemnly replied, and I knew that he meant it.”47The Teslas settled on the Polytechnic School at Graz, Austria, located 175 milesto the north. First, however, the boy would have to serve three years in thearmy. With a major war breaking out against the Turks, Milutin directed his sonto pack his gear and go into the hills to avoid the draft. There the youth couldmaintain a low profile and at the same time recover his health. “For most ofthis term I roamed in the mountains, loaded with a hunter’s outfit and a bundleof books, and this contact with nature made me stronger in body as well as inmind…but [my] knowledge of principles was very limited.”48Misguided inventions of this period included a “submarine tube…[able] to conveyletters and packages across the seas…[and] a ring around the equator” fortransporting people from one end of the globe to the other.”49 One day, whileplaying with snowballs on the side of a mountain, however, Tesla discovered theconcept of hidden trigger mechanisms able to unleash great reservoirs of energy:“One…found just the right conditions; it rolled until it was a large ball andthen spread out rolling up the snow at the sides as if it were a giant carpet,and then suddenly it turned into an avalanche…stripping the mountainside clearof snow, trees, soil and everything else it could carry with it.”50But contact with war was unavoidable, and on occasion the youth chanced upon itsravages. Twenty-five years later, he would recall, “I have seen men hung, beatento death, shot, quartered, stuck on a pointed stick, heads chopped off andchildren on a bayonette like quails ‘en broche’ at Delmonico’s.”51 Fortunately,Tesla avoided capture, and in 1875 he returned to Gospić. With a new fellowshipfrom the Military Frontier Authority, he began school in Austria the followingsemester."},{"pageContent":"3COLLEGE YEARS (1875-82) [002-toc.html#ch3]> It has cost me years of thought to arrive at certain results, by many believed> to be unattainable, for which there are now numerous claimants, and the number> of these is rapidly increasing, like that of the colonels in the South after> the war.> > NIKOLA TESLA1Eighty miles south of Vienna, in the capital of the province of Styria, was thePolytechnic School in Graz. Milutin had chosen the school because it was one ofthe most advanced of the region. The physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach hadtaught there a few years earlier, as had the psychophysiologist Gustav TheodorFechner. Planning on becoming a professor, Tesla undertook courses in arithmeticand geometry from Professor Rogner, a lecturer known for his histrionics;theoretical and experimental physics with the punctilious German professorPoeschl; and integral calculus with Professor Allé. Allé “was the most brilliantlecturer to whom I ever listened. He took a special interest in my progress andwould frequently remain for an hour or two in the lecture room, giving meproblems to solve, in which I delighted.”2 Other courses taken includedanalytical chemistry, mineralogy, machinery construction, botany, wave theory,optics, French, and English.3 To save money, he roomed with Kosta Kulishich,whom he had met at the Student Society of Serbia. Kulishich later became aprofessor of philosophy in Belgrade.4Tesla plunged into his work with great intensity. Studying upward of twentyhours a day, he changed his major to engineering and extended his curriculum tostudy other languages—he could speak about nine of them—and the works of suchwriters as Descartes, Goethe, Spencer, and Shakespeare, many of which he knewentirely by heart. “I had a veritable mania for finishing whatever I began,” herecalled, reflecting on his next self-appointed assignment. The collected worksof Voltaire comprised “one hundred large volumes in small print which thatmonster had written while drinking seventy-two cups of black coffee per diem.”5This task cured him of the compulsion but did not serve to quell the pattern ofrelentless self-denial and self-determination. Because he was praised by histeachers, the other students became jealous, but at first Tesla remainedunperturbed.Returning home the following summer, having passed his freshman year with all A+ ’s,6 the young scholar expected to be praised by his parents. Instead, hisfather tried to persuade his son to stay in Gospić. Unbeknown to Tesla, histeachers had written Milutin warning that the boy was at risk of injuring hishealth by obsessively long and intense hours of study. A rift was createdbetween father and son, perhaps in part because the Military Frontier Authorityhad been abolished and the scholarship was no longer available.Reacting to the ridicule from other students, who resented Tesla for hismonastic study habits and close association with the faculty, Tesla took upgambling. “He began to stay late at the Botanical Garden, the students’ favoritecoffee house, playing cards, billiards and chess, attracting a large crowd towatch his skillful performances.”7 Tesla’s father “led an exemplary life andcould not excuse the senseless waste of time and money…” “I can stop whenever Iplease,” he told his father, “but is it worth while to give up that which Iwould purchase with the joys of Paradise?”8During his sophomore year, a direct-current Gramme dynamo was delivered fromParis to Professor Poeschl’s physics class. It was equipped with the customarycommutator, a device that transferred the current from the generator to themotor. Electricity in its natural state is alternating. This means that itsdirection of flow changes rapidly. An analogous situation would be a river thatflowed downstream, then upstream, then downstream, and so on many times persecond.9 One can see the difficulty in harnessing such a river with, forinstance, a waterwheel, for the wheel would constantly change its direction aswell. The commutator is comprised of a series of wire brushes that serve totransfer the electricity into only one direction of flow, that is, a directcurrent (DC). It is a cumbersome device and sparks considerably.When Professor Poeschl displayed this up-to-date equipment, Tesla intuitivelydeduced that the commutator was unnecessary and that alternating current (AC)could be harnessed unencumbered. He voiced this opinion, which appeared utterlyfantastic at the time. Poeschl devoted the rest of the lecture to a detailedexplanation of how this goal was impossible. Driving the point home, Poeschlembarrassed his student by disconnecting the “superfluous” commutator and notingwith feigned surprise that the generator no longer worked.10 “Mr. Tesla may domany things, but this he can not accomplish. His plan is simply a perpetualmotion scheme.”11 Tesla would spend the next four years obsessed with provingthe professor wrong.Another invention Tesla worked on at the same time, but under the tutelage ofProfessor Allé, was that of a mechanical flying machine. As a child, Tesla hadheard stories from his grandfather about Napoleon’s employment of hot-airballoons, which were used to observe enemy troop movements and for droppingbombs. No doubt he had also studied the principles involved in school and quitepossibly saw such futuristic creations floating in the Austrian skies when hewent off to college.By his third year Tesla was running into difficulties at school. Havingsurpassed his classmates in his studies, he became bored and frustrated by hisinability to find a solution to his AC problem. He began to gamble more heavily,sometimes twenty-four hours at a stretch. Although Tesla tended to return hiswinnings to heavy losers, reciprocation did not occur, and one semester he losthis entire allowance, including the money for tuition. His father was fuming,but his mother came to him with “a roll of bills” and said, “Go and enjoyyourself. The sooner you lose all we possess the better it will be. I know thatyou will get over it.”12The audacious youth won back his initial losses and returned the balance to hisfamily. “I conquered my passion then and there,” he wrote, and “tore it from myheart so as not to leave a trace of desire. Ever since that time I have been asindifferent to any form of gambling as to picking teeth.”13 This statementappears to be an exaggeration, as Tesla gambled quite freely with his future andwas known to play billiards when he came to the United States. An Edisonemployee recalled: “He played a beautiful game. [Tesla] was not a high scorer,but his cushion shots displayed skill equal to that of a professional exponentof this art.”14 It has also been suggested that years later, in the early 1890s,Tesla bilked some of the wealthy socialites in New York by feigning minimalability in the sport.15Exam time came, and Tesla was unprepared. He asked for an extension to study butwas denied. He never graduated from the Austrian Polytechnic School and did notreceive any grades for his last semester there. Most likely, he was discharged,in part for gambling and, supposedly, “womanizing.”16 According to his roommate,Tesla’s “cousins, who had been sending him money, therefore withdrew their aid.”Fearing that his parents would find out, Tesla disappeared without word.“Friends searched everywhere for him and decided that he had drowned in theriver.”Clandestinely packing his gear, Tesla traveled south, over the border intoSlovenia, where he arrived in Maribor in late spring of 1878 to look for work.He played cards with the local man on the streets, as is still the custom today,and soon gained employment with an engineer “earning 60 florins a month,”17 butthe job was short-lived. Tesla continued traveling, making his way throughZagreb, to the small coastal village of Min-Gag. He would not return home, forhe did not want to confront his parents. At the same time, however, Tesla alsocontinued his quest for a solution to the problem of removing the commutatorfrom the DC generator.His cousin, Dr. Nikola Pribic, recalled a story he had heard as a boy growing upin Yugoslavia in the 1920s: “My mother told us…he would always like to be alone[when Tesla visited us]. In the morning he would go off into the woods andmeditate. He would measure one tree to another making notes, experimenting[stringing wires between them and transmitting current]. Peasants passing bywould be astonished at such an erratic person…They would approach and say,‘We’re sorry; your [cousin] seems to be crazy.’”18Having finally located his son, after word from Kulishich, who had seen Tesla inMaribor, Milutin traveled north to discuss his academic problems. Tesla refusedto return to Graz, so Milutin offered a solution: His son would make a freshstart at another university. They returned to Gospić.Reaccepted into the family, Tesla began once again to attend church to hear hisfather’s sermons. There he met Anna. She was “tall and beautiful [with]extraordinary understandable eyes.” For the first and only time in his life,Tesla would say, “I fell in love.” Delighting in her company, Nikola would takeAnna for strolls by the river or back to Smiljan, where they would talk aboutthe future. He wanted to become an electrical engineer; she wanted to raise afamily.19The following year, Milutin passed away, and a few months later, in 1880, Teslaleft for Bohemia (now in the Czech Republic) to “carry…out my father’s wish andcontinue my education.” He promised to write to Anna, but their romance wasdoomed, and she would marry shortly thereafter.Tesla enrolled in the Charles-Ferdinand branch of the University of Prague, oneof the foremost institutions in Europe, for the summer term.According to Ernst Mach, who, a decade earlier, had transferred from Graz to beappointed Rector Magnificus, Prague was a city “rich in talented people,” withstreet signs often appearing in a half-dozen languages. Although the city wasfilled with majestic buildings, sanitary conditions were severely lacking. Toavoid typhoid fever one had to boil water or obtain mineral water from springsto the north.20Just two years after Tesla’s stay, Harvard psychologist William James would cometo visit, to meet with Mach and Mach’s archrival, Carl Stumpf, “OrdinaryProfessor of Philosophy.” Stumpf was a student of the controversial ex-priestFranz Brentano (who also influenced another pupil, Sigmund Freud) and was alsoTesla’s philosophy teacher. Other courses Tesla undertook included analyticalgeometry with Heinreich Durege, experimental physics with Karel Domalip, both“Ordinary Professors,” and higher mathematics with Anton Puchta, who was an“Extraordinary Professor” from the German Technical University also in Prague.21With Stumpf, Tesla studied Scottish philosopher David Hume. Raised as a childprodigy of music, the acerbic and “sharp-nosed” Stumpf22 opposed a number of keypsychophysicists, including the famed Wilhelm Wundt as well as Mach, but at thesame time he also helped shape the thinking of a number of key students, such asphenomenologist Edmund Husserl and Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Kohler.23A persuasive advocate of Hume’s “radical skepticism,” Stumpf argued for theconcept of the “tabula rasa.” Basing his thinking on Aristotle and John Locke,both of whom repudiated the concept of innate ideas, Stumpf stated that thehuman mind was born a blank slate, a “tabula rasa”; impinging on it, afterbirth, were all of the “primary quality of things,” that is, true knowledgeabout the world. Through the sense organs, Tesla learned, the brain mechanicallyrecorded incoming data. The mind, according to Hume, was nothing more than asimple compilation of cause-and-effect sensations. What we call ideas weresecondary impressions derived from these primary sensations. The will and “eventhe soul w[ere] reduced by Hume to impressions and associations ofimpressions.”24 At this time, Tesla also studied the theories of Descartes, whoenvisioned animals, including man, as simply “automata incapable of actionsother than those characteristic of a machine.”25This line of thinking would dominate Tesla’s worldview and would ironicallyserve as the template for a mechanistic paradigm that would lead the inventor todiscover his most original creations, even though the whole idea of originaldiscovery appears to be antithetical to this extrinsically motivatedAristotelian premise. According to Tesla and to this view, all of hisdiscoveries were derived from the outside world.Although Tesla does not overtly refer to Stumpf’s perceived adversary, inretrospect, it appears obvious that Stumpf’s opposition did not stop Tesla fromstudying Mach’s experiments in wave mechanics. Born in Moravia (now the CzechRepublic) in 1838, Mach graduated from the University of Vienna in 1860. By 1864he was a full professor at Graz, and by 1867 he was head of the department ofexperimental physics at Prague, with four books and sixty-two articles to hiscredit. Influenced by the research in psychophysics of Fechner in Graz andLudwig von Helmholtz in Berlin, Mach studied the workings of the human eye,along with his Prague colleague “famed physiologist and philosopher” JanPurkyne. Both the eye and ear collected information from the outside world,analyzed it, and transferred it, via electrical impulses in the nerves, to therespective processing centers in the brain. This traditional line of researchhad been taken by many other well-known scientists, including Isaac Newton,Johann von Goethe, and Herbert Spencer, all favorites of Tesla’s.In his laboratory, Mach had constructed a “famous instrument known as a wavemachine. This device could make progressive [and standing] longitudinal [and]transverse waves…” Mach could display a number of mechanical effects with theseacoustic waves and “demonstrate the analogy between acoustic and electromagneticevents.” By this means, the “mechanical theory of the ether” could also bedemonstrated.26By studying acoustical-wave motion in association with mechanical, electrical,and optical phenomena, Mach discovered that when the speed of sound wasachieved, the nature of an air flow over an object changed dramatically. Thisthreshold value became known as Mach 1.Mach also wrote on the structure of the ether and hypothesized that it wasinherently linked to a gravitational attraction between all masses in theuniverse. Influenced overtly by Buddhist writings, which no doubt filtered downto esoteric discussions by the university students, Mach could hypothesize thatno event in the universe was separate from any other. “The inertia of a systemis reduced to a functional relationship between the system and the rest of theuniverse.”27 This viewpoint was extended to the relationship of mental events toexterior influences. Like Stumpf, he agreed that every mental event had to havea corresponding physical action.28Since Mach’s writings so closely parallel Tesla’s later research andphilosophical outlook, Mach seems a curious omission from Tesla’s publishedwritings.By the time Tesla left the university at the end of the term, he had made greatstrides, both theoretical and practical, in solving the AC dilemma. “It was inthat city,” Tesla said, “that I made a decided advance, which consisted indetaching the commutator from the machine and studying the phenomena in this newaspect.”29With the death of his father, he needed to earn his own living. He began anapprenticeship in teaching but did not enjoy it. Uncle Pajo suggested that hemove to Hungary, where employment could be obtained through a military friend,Ferenc Puskas, who ran the new “American” telephone exchange with his brotherTivadar.30 In January 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest, but he found to his dismaythat the operation had not yet been launched.The Puskas brothers were very busy men, running operations in St. Petersburg andoverseeing, in Paris, Thomas Edison’s incandescent lamp exhibit at the ParisExposition and fixing the lighting system at the opera house there.31 Out offunds and without a job, Tesla approached the Engineering Department at theCentral Telegraph Office of the Hungarian government and talked his way into aposition as a draftsman and designer. Working for a subsistence salary, heutilized what little surplus funds he had to purchase equipment to further hisexperiments.Anthony Szigeti, a former classmate and engineer from Hungary, “with the body ofApollo…[and] a big head with a lump on the side…[that] gave him a startlingappearance,”32 became Tesla’s friend and confidant. Many a night, when thebudding inventor was not enmeshed in his research, the two fellows would meet atthe local cafes, where they would discuss the events of the day or compete insuch friendly games as determining who could drink the most milk. On one suchoccasion, Tesla claimed he was beaten after the thirty-eighth bottle!33Due to his meager funds and general inability to budget himself, Tesla had butone suit, which had withered from use. It was the time of a religious festival,and Szigeti inquired what Tesla would be wearing. Stuck for an answer, theyouthful inventor came upon the clever idea of turning his suit inside out,planning thereby to show up with a seemingly new set of clothes. All night wasspent tailoring and ironing. But when one starts with a wrong premise, no amountof patching can right the problem. The outfit looked ridiculous, and Teslastayed home instead.34In a few months, the American telephone exchange opened there in Budapest andTesla and Szigeti immediately gained employment. The new enterprise allowed theyoung engineers to finally learn firsthand how the most modern inventions of theday operated. It was also the first time that Tesla was introduced to the workof Thomas Edison, the “Napoleon of Invention,” whose improvements on Bell’stelephone helped revolutionize the field of communications. Up the poles Teslawould climb to check the lines and repair equipment. On the ground he worked asa mechanic and mathematician. There he studied the principle of induction,whereby a mass with an electric or electromagnetic charge can provide acorresponding charge or force or magnetism in a second mass without contact. Healso studied a number of Edison’s inventions, such as his multiplex telegraph,which allowed four Morse-coded messages to be sent in two directionssimultaneously, and his new induction-triggered carbon disk speaker, the flat,circular, easily removable device which is still found in the mouthpiece ofevery telephone today. As was his nature, Tesla took apart the variousinstruments and conceived ways of improving them. By giving the carbon disk aconical shape, he fashioned an amplifier, which repeated and boostedtransmission signals. Tesla had invented a precursor of the loudspeaker. Henever bothered to obtain a patent on it.Except for friendly diversion with Szigeti, Tesla’s every spare moment was spentreworking the problem of eliminating the commutator in DC machines andharnessing AC without cumbersome intermediaries. Although a solution seemedimminent, the answer would not be revealed. Hundreds of hours were spentbuilding and rebuilding equipment and discussing his ideas with his friend.35He pored over his calculations and reviewed the work of others. Tesla laterwrote: “With me it was a sacred vow, a question of life or death. I knew that Iwould perish if I failed.”36 Monomaniacal in pursuit of his goal, he gave upsleep, or rest of any kind, straining every fiber to prove once and for all thathe was right and Professor Poeschl and the rest of the world were wrong. Hisbody and brain finally gave out, and he suffered a severe nervous collapse,experiencing an illness that “surpasses all belief.” Claiming that his pulseraced to 250 beats per minute, his body twitched and quivered incessantly.37 “Icould hear the ticking of a watch…three rooms [away]. A fly alighting on atable…would cause a dull thud in my ear. A carriage passing at a distance…fairlyshook my whole body…I had to support my bed on rubber cushions to get any restat all…The sun’s rays, when periodically intercepted, would cause blows of suchforce on my brain that they would stun me…In the dark I had the sense of a batand could detect the presence of an object…by a peculiar creepy sensation on theforehead.” A respected doctor “pronounced [his] malady unique and incurable.”Desperately clinging to life, Tesla was not expected to recover.38Tesla attributes his revival to “a powerful desire to live and to continue thework” and to the assistance of the athletic Szigeti, who forced him outdoors andgot him to undertake healthful exercises. Mystics attributed the event to thetriggering of his pineal gland and corresponding access to higher mysticalstates of consciousness.39 During a walk in the park with Szigeti at sunset, thesolution to the problem suddenly became manifest as he was reciting a “gloriouspassage” from Goethe’s Faust.> See how the setting sun, with ruddy glow,> The green-embosomed hamlet fires.> > He sinks and fades, the day is lived and gone.> > He hastens forth new scenes of life to waken.> O for a wing to lift and bear me on,> And on to where his last rays beckon.“As I uttered these inspiring words,” Tesla declared, “the truth was [suddenly]revealed. I drew with a stick on the sand the diagrams shown six years later inmy address before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers…Pygmalionseeing his statue come to life could not have been more deeply moved. A thousandsecrets of nature which I might have stumbled upon accidentally I would havegiven for that one which I had wrestled from her against all odds and at theperil of my existence.”40Tesla emphasized that his conceptualization involved new principles rather thanrefinements of preexisting work.The AC creation came to be known as the rotating magnetic field. Simply stated,Tesla utilized two circuits instead of the customary single circuit to transmitelectrical energy and thus generated dual currents ninety degrees out of phasewith each other. The net effect was that a receiving magnet (or motor armature),by means of induction, would rotate in space and thereby continually attract asteady stream of electrons whether or not the charge was positive or negative.He also worked out the mechanism to explain the effect.41image 1 [images/image-01.jpg]Follow the letter N in each of the stages above.Motor Schematics Showing Magnetic Field Rotation.Tesla referred to this diagram (or one quite similar to it) in his lecturebefore the American Society of Electrical Engineers for the first time in 1888.Each square represents the same armature at different points in its rotation.There are two independent circuits or currents set up diagonally across from oneanother which are 90 degrees out of phase with each other in both position andtiming. So, for instance, in the first position, the armature points to thenorth pole (of the north/south circuit, which runs from bottom right to topleft). The other circuit (running from bottom left to top right) is in theposition of changing so that neither pole has a charge. If we look to the nextsquare to the right (which is occurring a fraction of a second later as thecurrents continue to alternate), we note that the charge is beginning to enterthe second circuit (i.e., running from bottom left to top right). At this pointin the other circuit, the charge is beginning to reverse itself as well butstill has the same polarity. As there are two north poles set up at thisfraction of a second, the armature rotates to go between the two of them. In thethird square, the bottom right-top left circuit is now neutralized on its way toreversing its polarity, while the bottom left-top right circuit maintains thepolarity it has just entered. Therefore, the armature continues its movement tothe most northward position, and so on.42“In less than two months,” Tesla wrote, “I evolved virtually all the types ofmotors and modifications of the system now identified with my name…It was amental state of happiness as complete as I have ever known in life. Ideas camein an uninterrupted stream and the only difficulty I had was to hold themfast.”43 Tesla invented, at this time, not only single-phase motors whereby thetwo circuits were 90 degrees out of phase with each other, but also polyphasemotors which used three or more circuits of the same frequency in various otherdegrees out of phase with each other. Motors would be run entirely in his mind;improvements and additions to design were conceived; finally, plans andmathematical calculations would eventually be transferred to a notebook. Thisstep-by-step procedure would become customary.Ferenc Puskas, who had initially hired Tesla, asked if he wanted to help hisbrother Tivadar run the new Edison lighting company in Paris. Tesla said, “Igladly accepted.”44 Szigeti was also offered a position, so Tesla was fortunateto have a good friend with whom he could share the new adventure.Was Tesla the first to conceive of a rotating magnetic field? The answer is no.As far back as 1824, a French astronomer by the name of François Aragoexperimented with spinning the arm of a magnet by using a copper disc.The first workable rotating magnetic field similar to Tesla’s 1882 revelationwas conceived three years before him by Mr. Walter Baily, who demonstrated theprinciple before the Physical Society of London on June 28, 1879, in a paperentitled “A Mode of Producing Arago’s Rotations.”45 The invention comprised twobatteries connected to two pairs of electromagnets bolted catty-corner to eachother in an X pattern, with a commutator used as a switching device. Therotating magnetic field was initiated and maintained by manually cranking thecommutator. On this occasion Baily stated, “The disk can be made to rotate bymeans of intermittent rotation of the field effected by means ofelectromagnets.”46Two years later, at the Paris Exposition of 1881, came the work of MarcelDeprez, who calculated “that a rotating magnetic field could be produced withoutthe aid of a commutator by energizing electromagnets with two out-of-step ACcurrents.”47 However, Deprez’s invention, which won an award at the electricalshow, had a major problem: One of the currents was “furnished by the machineitself.” Furthermore, the invention was never practically demonstrated.48Other researchers who conceived of a rotating magnetic field analogous toTesla’s but after his revelation (in early 1882) were Professor Galileo Ferrarisof Turin, Italy (1885-88), and an American engineer, Charles Bradley (1887).Ferraris was influenced by the work of Lucien Gaulard and George Gibbs, whodesigned AC transformers during the mid 1880s. In 1883 they presented their ACsystem at the Royal Aquarium in London,49 and in 1885 they installed an ACsystem of power distribution in Italy, where they met Ferraris.50 Purchased byGeorge Westinghouse for $50,000, the system was installed in Great Barrington,Massachusetts, the following year by William Stanley, Westinghouse’s headengineer. The Gaulard-Gibbs invention, however, did not do away with thecommutator, which was the express purpose of Tesla’s design.In Ferraris’s published treatise on his independent discovery of a rotatingmagnetic field, he wrote, “This principle cannot be of any commercial importanceas a motor.” After learning of Tesla’s work, Ferraris stated, “Tesla developedit much further than [I]…did.”51Bradley filed for a patent for an AC polyphase device on May 8, 1887 (no.390,439) after nine Tesla AC patents had been granted. Haselwander, in the sameyear, utilized slip rings in place of commutators on DC Thomson-Houstonequipment and also designed two- and three-phase windings on DC armatures.52The question of priority concerning Tesla’s invention was discussed by SilvanusP. Thompson, a physics professor in London, in his 1897 comprehensive text on ACmotors. Thompson (no relationship to Elihu Thomson), considered at the time tobe “perhaps the best known writer on electrical subjects now living,” said thatTesla’s work separated itself clearly from predecessors and contemporaries inhis “discovery of a new method of electrical transmission of power [emphasisadded].”53A question that remains unanswered was whether or not Tesla knew of Baily’swork. It is quite possible that he had read Baily’s paper, although no one atthe time, including Baily, comprehended the importance of the research orunderstood how to turn it into a practical invention.54 Tesla stated in theearly 1890s, “I am aware that it is not new to produce the rotations of a motorby intermittently changing the poles of one of its elements…In such cases,however, I imply true alternating currents; and my invention consists in thediscovery of the mode or method of utilizing such currents.”55A few years later, in a well-publicized case involving patent priorities on whatcame to be known as the “Tesla Alternating Current Polyphase System,” JudgeTownsend of the U.S. Circuit Court of Connecticut noted that before Tesla’sinvention and lecture to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE)in 1888, there had been no AC motors; furthermore, no one attending the lecturerecognized any priorities. Whereas Baily had dealt with “impracticalabstractions, Tesla had created a workable product which initiated a revolutionin the art.”56 The Tesla patents were also sustained against individual casesinvolving Charles Bradley, Mons. Cabanellas and Dumesnil, William Stanley, andElihu Thomson.57In citing a previous case on a similar issue, Judge Townsend responded to whattoday is called the “doctrine of obviousness”:> The apparent simplicity of a new device often leads an inexperienced person to> think that it would have occurred to anyone familiar with the subject, but the> decisive answer is that with dozens and perhaps hundreds of others laboring in> the same field, it had never occurred to anyone before [Potta v. Creager, 155> U.S. 597]…Baily and the others [e.g., Bradley, Ferraris, Stanley] did not> discover the Tesla invention; they were discussing electric light machines> with commutators…Eminent electricians united in the view that by reason of> reversals of direction and rapidity of alternations, an alternating current> motor was impracticable, and the future belonged to the commutated continuous> current…> > It remained for the genius of Tesla to…transform the toy of Arago into an> engine of power.58The discovery of how to effectively harness the rotating magnetic field wasreally only a fraction of Tesla’s creation. Before his invention, electricitycould be pumped approximately one mile, and then only for illuminatingdwellings. After Tesla, electrical power could be transmitted hundreds of miles,and then not only for lighting but for running household appliances andindustrial machines in factories. Tesla’s creation was a leap ahead in a rapidlyadvancing technological revolution."},{"pageContent":"4TESLA MEETS THE WIZARD OF MENLO PARK (1882-85) [002-toc.html#ch4]> O, he’s a great talker, and, say, he’s a great eater too.

Concurrently, he was getting paid for theexperience. Paris in the 1880s was a center of modern fashion: men in theircutaway coats and silk top hats, women with braided hair, in long frilleddresses with bustles, and wealthy tourists ready to take back the latestfineries to their respective nations. Tesla was met by Ferenc’s brother TivadarPuskas, a hard driver but also a man known to talk in “air balloons.”2 Tesla,whose head could also soar into the clouds, had met a powerful ally. Mindful ofthe need for secrecy, they discussed strategies for approaching CharlesBatchelor, manager of the newly formed Compagnie Continental Edison, withTesla’s new motor as the young inventor was introduced to operations.Formerly a resident of Manchester, England, Batchelor, a “master mechanic,” hadbeen sent to America a decade earlier to present innovative threadmakingmachinery recently created by his employers, the Coates Thread Company.3 Therehe met Edison and shortly became his most trusted associate. Batchelor worked onthe first phonographs and on perfecting the filament for the lightbulb. He alsoran operations in New Jersey and then in Europe, owning a 10 percent share ofEdison’s many worldwide companies.4 An open-minded individual, Batchelor wasapproachable, although also rather busy.Anthony Szigeti probably emigrated from Budapest at the same time as Tesla,since both were hired by Puskas and “were together almost constantly in Paris.”Szigeti wrote, “Tesla [was very]…much excited over the ideas which he then hadof operating motors. He talked with me many times about them and told me hisplan…[of] constructing and operating motors…[and] dispensing with thecommutator.”5Having just purchased a large factory at Ivry-sur-Seine, for the construction ofgenerators and manufacture of lightbulbs, Batchelor, as Edison’s closestpartner, was planning on erecting central lighting stations throughout Europe.He also had plans in England, where the Crystal Palace Exposition was thendisplaying Edison’s new incandescent lamp.6 Batchelor would need good men to runthe concerns and wrote Edison frequently as to the expertise of the variousworkers. He was particularly impressed with Puskas, who had successfully run theEdison lighting exhibit at the Paris Exposition of 1881. “Puskas…[is the onlyworker] having any idea of ‘push,’” he wrote, “and I think that you shouldinsist on him [becoming a partner].”7Within six months Edison Continental would be producing lamps superior to thosefrom America;8 the company would erect central stations in most of the majorcities of Europe for indoor lighting and also administer the large outdoor arclamps which were being used to illuminate the urban streets. Tesla, who wasworking at Ivry-sur-Seine, would be trained with the other workers to travel outand help run these facilities. “I never can forget the deep impression thatmagic city produced on my mind. For several days after my arrival I roamed thru[sic] the streets in utter bewilderment of the new spectacle. The attractionswere many and irresistible, but, alas, the income was spent as soon as received.When Mr. Puskas asked me how I was getting along…I [replied] ‘the lasttwenty-nine days of the month are the toughest!’”9In the mornings, before work, Tesla would arise at 5:00 A.M. to swimtwenty-seven laps at a bathhouse on the Seine, and in the evenings he would playbilliards with the workers and discuss his new AC invention. “One of them, Mr.D. Cunningham, foreman of the Mechanical Department, offered to form a stockcompany. The proposal seemed to me comical in the extreme. I did not have thefaintest conception of what that meant except that it was the American way ofdoing things.”10T. C. Martin writes: “In fact, but for the solicitations of a few friends incommercial circles who urged him to form a company to exploit the invention, Mr.Tesla, then a youth of little worldly experience, would have sought an immediateopportunity to publish his ideas, believing them to be [a]…radical advance inelectrical theory as well as destined to have a profound influence on all dynamoelectric machinery.”11In his spare time, and as was his custom, Tesla wrote out the specifications andmathematics of his AC invention in a notebook12 and worked on alternativedesigns for his flying machine. He probably sought out financial backers, for hereceived an invitation to go on a shooting expedition from a “prominent Frenchmanufacturer.”13 Perhaps the inventor had not totally recovered from the strangeillness he had almost succumbed to in Budapest, for after this outing hesuffered the “sensation that my brain had caught fire. I saw a light as [though]a small sun was located in it and I [passed] the whole night applying coldcompressions to my tortured head.” Writing this passage almost forty yearslater, Tesla claimed that “these luminous phenomena still manifest themselvesfrom time to time, as when a new idea opening up possibilities strikes me.”14In the summer he worked on the lighting at the opera house in Paris or went toBavaria to help in the wiring of a theater; and in the autumn he may have helpedin the laying of underground cables for the new central station going up inParis or traveled to Berlin to install incandescent lighting at the cafes.15At the end of the year Tesla “submitted to one of the administrators of theCompany, Mr. Rau, a plan for improving their dynamos, and was given anopportunity.” Louis Rau, who was director of the Compagnie Continental Edison inrue Montchanien and had “his beautiful home lit with the Edison system,”16allowed Tesla to implement his modernization plan. Shortly thereafter the younginventor’s automatic regulators were completed and accepted gratefully.17 Teslawas probably hoping to be compensated for his new contributions, but he was sentto work in Strasbourg before financial compensation was awarded.In January 1883, Batchelor shipped twelve hundred lamps to the Strasbourg plant,located at the railroad station.18 And within three months Tesla arrived tooversee the operations. There he would stay for the next twelve months.Batchelor had been urging Edison to test the generators coming from America forat least “two or three days with a [full] load,” as fires from faulty armaturesand poor insulation were becoming too common. The powerhouse at Strasbourg, inparticular, had been subject to this type of problem.19 Since “all our plantsare differently constructed,”20 it would take well-trained and creativeengineers to run things smoothly. Batchelor demonstrated confidence in Tesla’sabilities by sending him to Strasbourg; however, he seems not to have mentionedTesla in his correspondence with Edison. In any event, Tesla’s account of thesituation in Strasbourg corroborates Batchelor’s: “The wiring was defective andon the occasion of the opening ceremonies a large part of a wall was blown outthru [sic] a short-circuit right in the presence of old Emperor William I. TheGerman Government refused to take the plant and the French Company was facing aserious loss. On account of my knowledge of the German language and pastexperience, I was entrusted with the difficult task of straightening outmatters.”21Having anticipated a long stay in the region, Tesla had brought with him fromParis materials for his first AC motor. As soon as he was able, Teslaconstructed the motor in secret in a closet “in a mechanical shop opposite therailroad station”;22 however, summer would arrive before this first machine wasin operation. Anthony Szigeti, his assistant, forged an iron disk, which Tesla“mounted on a needle,” having surrounded it, in part, with a coil.23 “Finally,”Tesla wrote, “[I] had the satisfaction of seeing rotation effected byalternating currents of different phase, and without sliding contacts orcommutator, as I had conceived a year before. It was an exquisite pleasure, butnot to compare with the delirium of joy following the first revelation.”24Tesla presented his new creation to his friend, Mr. Bauzin, the mayor of thetown, who tried his best to interest wealthy investors; “but to mymortification…[there was] no response.” Upon his return to Paris, he soughtpromised compensation for achieving a difficult success in Strasbourg.Approaching his employers, “after several days of…circulus vicious, it dawned onme that my reward was a castle in Spain…Mr. Batchelor [pressed] me to go toAmerica with a view of redesigning the Edison machines; I determined to try myfortunes in the land of Golden Promise.”25John O’Neill, Tesla’s first major biographer, has suggested that Batchelor wrotea note of introduction to Edison which read, “I know two great men and you areone of them; the other is this young man.”26 Evidence for the veracity of thisoft-repeated tale is lacking. Batchelor, for instance, had been back in Americafor at least three months prior to Tesla’s arrival;27 thus, he would not havehad to write a letter. Furthermore, there is evidence that Edison had alreadymet Tesla in Paris during a littleknown sojourn he took to look over hisEuropean operations at that time.28 O’Neill also refers to Batchelor incorrectlyas Edison’s “former assistant”29 when Batchelor was probably Edison’s closestlifelong colleague. Edison does, however, substantiate that “Tesla worked for mein New York. He was brought over from Paris by Batchelor, my assistant,”30 butthere is no reference to Batchelor’s appreciation of Tesla’s genius. On October28, 1883, fully a year after Tesla began working for Edison Continental, whilehe was stationed in Strasbourg, Batchelor singled out “the names of…two [orthree] I can mention as capable as far as their work shows: Mr. Stout—aninspector; Mr. Vissiere—my assistant; Mr. Geoffrey—whose plants are alwaysspoken well of…There are others capable, but I think these are the best.”31Certainly, had Tesla impressed Batchelor as O’Neill contends, he should havebeen listed in this letter or in numerous other letters to Edison that I havereviewed.Before Tesla left for America, he spent time with a scientist who was studyingmicroscopic organisms found in common drinking water. Combined with the scare hehad with his bout with cholera a few years earlier, Tesla acquired a phobiawhich led him to shun unpurified water, scour his plates and utensils beforeeating, and refrain from frequenting unsavory restaurants. He would later write,“If you would watch only for a few minutes the horrible creatures, hairy andugly beyond anything you can conceive, tearing each other up with the juicesdiffusing throughout the water—you would never again drink a drop of unboiled orunsterilized water.”32In the spring of 1884, with funds for the journey supplied by Uncles Petar andPajo,33 Tesla packed his gear and caught the next boat for America. Although histicket and money and some of his luggage were stolen, the young man was notdeterred. “Resolve, helped by dexterity, won out in the nick of time…[and] Imanaged to embark for New York with the remnants of my belongings, some poemsand articles I had written, and a package of calculations relating to solutionsof an unsolvable integral and to my flying machine.”34 The voyage appears not tohave been a happy one; a “mutiny” of sorts occurred on board, and Tesla wasnearly knocked overboard.35In 1808, Sir Humphry Davy created artificial illuminescence by running anelectric current across a small gap between two carbon rods. This simple deviceevolved into the arc lamp, used in English lighthouses in the 1860s anddisplayed at the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876 by Moses Farmer. By 1877numerous investigators were exploring the possibility of placing theincandescent effect within glassed enclosures because they would be much saferthis way for marketing to households, and a race developed between suchinventors as Charles Brush, Thomas Edison, Moses Farmer, St. George Lane-Fox,Hiram Maxim, William Sawyer, and Joseph Swan.“I saw the thing had not gone so far but that I had a chance,” Edison said.36And so he challenged William Wallace, Farmer’s partner, to a race as to whowould be the first man to create an efficient electric light. Boasting that hewould soon light up New York City with 500,000 incandescent lamps, Edison andhis business manager, Grosvenor Lowery, were able to secure large amounts ofcapital from such investors as Henry Villard, owner of the first trans-Americanrailroad, and financier J. Pierpont Morgan.In November 1878, after three years of research, a hard-drinking telegrapher bythe name of William Sawyer and his lawyer-partner Albion Man, applied for apatent for an incandescent lamp with carbon rods (filaments) and filled withnitrogen. They proclaimed that they had beaten Edison. Joseph Swan, anothercompetitor, removed the nitrogen and kept the carbon filament but created alow-resistance lamp. Realizing that the amount of power required to sendelectricity a few hundred feet was prodigious using the low-resistance design,Edison created, in September 1878, a high-resistance vacuum lamp that utilizedconsiderably less power. Together with a revolutionary wiring called a feederline,37 his success was further augmented by a new Sprengel pump, which WilliamCrookes had been recommending for the creation of vacuums in glass-enclosedtubes. It would be another six months—April 22, 1879—before he would file for apatent, but his new design would lower power requirements and thereby cut coppercosts one hundredfold.38The competition was fierce, and Edison’s financial backers were running scared.They suggested to Edison that they purchase the Sawyer patents and combine thetwo companies. Edison had not yet settled on carbon as a filament and wasexhausting his working capital in experiments with boron, iridium, magnesium,platinum, silicon, and zirconia. At the same time, he had also sent explorers tothe Amazon, Bolivia, Japan, and Sumatra in search of rare forms of bamboo, whichhe was also considering. It would not be until 1881 that he finally settled upona form of carbonized paper.During this time, however, and without Edison’s knowledge, Sawyer and Manapproached Lowery. Their lamp was superior to Edison’s; it was patented, and itworked. Lowery tried to bring Edison in for a four-way discussion; however,Edison sent an emissary who “dared not relay to Edison all Lowery had said. ButEdison heard enough to be jolted from his indecision…Cursing and sprayingtobacco juice, he exclaimed it was the old story—lack of confidence!”39Edison was adamant about not joining with Sawyer or Swan or anyone else. Hecontinued rash publicity campaigns which announced “a veritable Aladdin’slamp…[It is] Edison’s light, the great inventor’s triumph.”40With the backing of Wall Street moguls, Edison began to illuminate Menlo Parkand the private homes of the wealthy in New York City. The first was that of J.Pierpont Morgan, at Thirty-Sixth Street and Madison Avenue. The year was 1881.To run the generator Edison designed a steam engine and boiler and placed thepower plant under the stable in a newly dug cellar at the back edge of theproperty. Wires were connected to the new incandescent lights placed in the gasfixtures of the home via a brick-lined tunnel which ran the length of the yardjust beneath the surface. “Of course, there were the frequent short circuits andmany breakdowns on the part of the generating plant. Even at the best, it was asource of a good deal of trouble for the family and neighbors. who complained ofthe noise of the dynamo. Mrs. James M. Brown next door said that its vibrationsmade her house shake.” Morgan had to pile sandbags around the inside of thecellar and place the machinery on heavy rubber pads “to deaden the noise and thevibrations. This final experiment restored quiet and brought peace to theneighborhood until the winter, when all the stray cats in the neighborhoodgathered on this warm strip in great numbers and their yowlings gave grounds[from the neighbors] for more complaints.”41The following year, on September 4, 1882, the new Central Station at PearlStreet opened. It provided electric lighting to many Wall Street buildings,including Morgan’s office.Tesla’s ship dropped anchor in New York in late spring of 1884, just as themonumental decade-long project the Brooklyn Bridge was being completed and thelast components of the Statue of Liberty were being hoisted into position.Twenty-eight years old, “tall and spare, [with] thin, refined face”42 andsporting a mustache, Tesla still had the look of an adolescent.His first impression of the New World was that it was uncivilized, a hundredyears behind the lifestyle of the great European cities. Deferring his plannedmeeting with Edison one day to look up an old friend, Tesla had the good fortuneto pass by “a small machine shop in which the foreman was trying to repair anelectric machine…He had just given up the task as hopeless.”43 One rendition ofthe story has Tesla agreeing to fix the machine “without a thought forcompensation.”44 On a separate occasion, Tesla revealed that “it was a machine Ihad helped design, but I did not tell them that. I asked…‘what would you give meif I fix it?’ ‘Twenty dollars’ was the reply. I took off my coat and went towork, [and]…had it running perfectly in an hour.”45 The story is importantbecause, depending on the rendition, two different Teslas emerge, one motivatedby money and one not.In either case, Tesla was shocked by the rough character of the New World.46 Heproceeded cautiously to Edison’s new laboratory, a former ironworks at GoerckStreet, situated only a few blocks from the central lighting station Edison wasconstructing at Pearl Street.47 Batchelor probably met Tesla and introduced himto the inventor. “I was thrilled to the marrow by meeting Edison,” Tesla said.48Possibly aware of the proximity of Transylvania to Tesla’s birthplace and aresurgence of interest in the tales of Vlad Dracula, the fifteenthcenturyalleged vampire who lived in the region, Edison inquired whether or not the“neophyte…had ever tasted human flesh?”49Aghast at the question and Edison’s “utter disregard of the most elementaryrules of hygiene,”50 Tesla replied in the negative and asked what Edison’s dietconsisted of.“You mean to make me so all-fired smart?”Tesla nodded.“Why, I eat a daily regimen of Welsh rabbit,” Edison replied. “It’s the onlybreakfast guaranteed to renew one’s mental faculties after the long vigils oftoil.”Wanting to emulate the grand wizard, the neophyte took on the peculiar diet,“accepting as true, in spite of a protesting stomach, the jocular suggestion.”51Tesla’s various accounts of this meeting differ markedly, depending on his moodat the time of the telling and his awareness of the size and shape of theaudience. For in his autobiography, published in six installments of HugoGernsback’s futuristic magazine Electrical Experimenter, Tesla wrote that ‘themeeting with Edison was a memorable event in my life. I was amazed at thiswonderful man who, without early advantages and scientific training, hadaccomplished so much. I had studied a dozen languages, delved in literature andart, and had spent my best years in libraries…and felt that most of my life hadbeen squandered.”52It wasn’t long before Tesla realized that his academic training and mathematicalskills had given him a great engineering advantage over Edison’s ploddingstrategy of trial and error. In a bitter moment of reminiscence, at the time ofEdison’s death in 1931, Tesla said: “If he had a needle to find in a haystack hewould not stop to reason where it was most likely to be, but would proceed atonce with the feverish diligence of a bee, to examine straw after straw until hefound the object of his search…I was almost a sorry witness of his doings,knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor…Trusting himself entirely to his inventor’s instinct andpractical American sense…the truly prodigious amount of his actualaccomplishments is little short of a miracle.”53It was little wonder that Tesla was completely unsuccessful in describing hisnew AC invention to Edison and had to settle for Batchelor’s suggestion that heredesign the prevailing DC machinery instead. According to Tesla, “the Managerhad promised me $50,000 on completion of this task,”54 and so Tesla set himselfto work, “experiment[ing] day and night, holidays not excepted,” as was thecustom of the factory.55Thomas Alva Edison was an extremely complex fellow. Ornery, ingenious,determined, and unyielding, he was a fierce competitor and the single mostimportant inventive force on the planet. He had descended from a grandfather,John Edison, a Tory who had been tried for treason during the AmericanRevolution and banished to Canada, and a father, Samuel Edison, who had tied hisson to a whipping post and beaten him publicly after young Al, as he was calledthen, had started a fire in a barn which threatened the rest of the buildings inthe community.56 He had scrapped with and outwitted others on his way to WallStreet and had outdistanced competing inventors numerous times. Notches onEdison’s belt of “better mousetraps” included the telephone transmitter(microphone), an electrical pen, a musical telephone, and the duplex, aningenious device which enabled a telegraph to send four messages in twodirections simultaneously.Edison was known to curse and swap jokes with his men at his research anddevelopment center, the world’s first invention factory. He kept his businessfree of cockroaches with a protective electric grid lining the edges of thefloor and “electrifried larger varmints” with his “rat paralyzer”; he evenoccasionally wired the washbasin to keep his men on their toes. Edison was atrickster, a storyteller, and a con artist. The use to the consumer and the costof production or “the market test [was] the sole test of achievement…Everythinghe did was directed by [that] realization.”57In an entirely different realm of invention, besides being a better technicianthan anyone else, Edison was a creator; his most original work was a machinethat talked: the phonograph. With this device, Edison had entered the realm ofthe immortal; he was the “Wizard of Menlo Park.”Inviting the public to his laboratory on a number of occasions, Edison amazedpeople at all levels of society with machines that sang and reproduced the soundof birds, artificial lamps that changed the darkness into a light cherry red,and various other mechanical contrivances to make one’s workload easier.The invention of the electric light was to Edison not only a new, clevertechnology; it contained the seeds of a new industry. His mere presence in thefield drove the stocks of the gas-burning companies into the grave. Yet Edisonplanned to utilize their pipes by channeling copper wire through them instead ofdangerous gas and to replace flame by electricity. He moved the center of hisoperation from New Jersey to New York City. There Edison rented a town house forhis wife and family in celebrated Gramercy Park, the abode of such luminaries asauthors Mark Twain and Stephen Crane, sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, architectStanford White, Century editor Richard Watson Gilder, and publisher JamesHarper.58 Edison later described his plans for orchestrating a revolution inhome illumination: “I had the central station in mind all the time…I got aninsurance map of New York City, laid out a district [bounded by] Wall Street,Canal, Broadway [and the] East River, [and purchased] two old bum buildings downin Pearl Street. They charged us $75,000 a piece. I tell you it made my hairstand on end.”59Edison’s financial problems were numerous. Not only were there expensivestart-up costs, there were also problems with the extreme inefficiency of the DCsystem and court battles on invention priorities and marketing battles againstsuch competitors as Brush Electric, Consolidated Electric, Sawyer-Man, SwanIncandescent, Thomson-Houston, United States Electric, and the WestinghouseCorporation.“Tell Westinghouse to stick to air brakes. He knows all about them,” Edisoncomplained;60 but Westinghouse would not listen.Edison’s other major competitor was Elihu Thomson. With Edison embroiled in alegal contest with Sawyer, Thomson used the ambiguity of the moment toappropriate the incandescent lamp Edison had given him and make it the templatefor ones produced and sold by the Thomson-Houston Electric Company. On October8, 1883, the patent office ruled that William Sawyer had priority over Edison“for an incandescent lamp with carbon burner.”61 This decision, though lateroverturned in Edison’s favor, enabled Thomson to continue his piracy. Due toSawyer’s priority, Thomson now saw himself as “ethically in the clear”62 as noclear-cut inventor had supposedly been established.Edison thus came to vigorously dislike Thomson, a man who had betrayed histrust, and Westinghouse, who was now siding with Sawyer. For safety, aesthetic,and practical reasons, Edison was a proponent of underground cables and DC.“Nobody hoisted water and gas mains into the air on stilts,” he said.63 Hepublicized the fact that electricians were dying on the dangerous overhead wiresof his competitors, but this battle eventually became transformed into DC versusAC; Edison stayed with DC, while Thomson and Westinghouse began to experimentwith AC. As AC utilized much higher voltages, Edison warned the public againstit. A long legal battle with Westinghouse ensued and ran into the millions ofdollars. Thomson again managed quietly to avoid the courts while he expanded hisbusiness.Francis Upton, Edison’s mathematician, graduate of Helmholtz’s laboratory, andcontemporary of Tesla’s in terms of European education, had calculated in 1879that to light 8,640 lamps for only nine city blocks, the cost would be $200,812for the 803,250 pounds of copper required. Through clever wiring, improvementsin lamp design, and “an invention corollary to the parallel circuitry,” Edisonhad cut copper costs almost 90 percent, but no matter what he did, a powerstation could never reach beyond a radius of one or two miles.64Upton, whom Edison affectionately referred to as “Culture,” suggested that theylook into the new advances in AC, and so he was sent, in 1884, to Europe tonegotiate with Karl Zipernowski, Otto Blathy, and Max Deri, three Hungarians whohad greatly improved the Gaulard-Gibbs AC transformer. Edison even paid $5,000for an option on this “ZBD” system, but it was mostly to placate Culture. Thewizard did not trust AC, and if his “damn fool competitors” were in it, hecertainly didn’t want any part of it. Twenty years of experience, ingenuity, anddoing the impossible with DC had to be worth something. The “bugs” could beworked out.Yet at the same time that Edison constructed DC generators to make the earthtremble65 and competitors stole his ideas or fashioned other primitiveelectric-lighting devices, a Serbian genius in his very midst had designed asystem which made this prevailing technology obsolete.According to W. L. Dickson, one of Edison’s earliest biographers and longtimeemployee at Menlo Park and Goerck Street, “Nikola Tesla, that effulgent star ofthe scientific heavens, even then gave strong evidence of the genius that hasmade him one of the standard authorities of the day.” Tesla’s “brilliantintellect” had held Dickson and the other workers “spellbound” as he“alternately fired [us] with the rapid sketching of his manifold projects ormelted [us] into keenest sympathy by pictures of his Herzogovinian home…But likemost holders of God’s intrinsic gifts, he was unostentatious in the extreme, andready to assist with counsel or manual help any perplexed member of thecraft.”66Although unable to interest Edison in his AC motor, Tesla was able “within a fewweeks [to win]…Edison’s confidence.” Tesla’s greatest success came when he fixeda badly broken set of dynamos on Henry Villard’s ocean liner, the Oregon, thefirst boat ever to have electric lighting. “At five o’clock in the morning, whenpassing along 5th Avenue on my way to the shop,” Tesla recalled, “I met Edisonwith Batchelor and a few others who were returning to retire.“‘Here is our Parisian running around at night,’ he said. When I told him I wascoming from the Oregon and had repaired both machines he looked at me insilence…But when he walked some distance I heard him remark: ‘Batchelor, this isa damn good man,’ and from that time on I had full freedom in directing thework.”67Alternately spending time at the Pearl Street Station or the Goerck ironworks,Tesla installed and fixed indoor incandescent lamps and outdoor arc lamps,reassembled many of Edison’s DC generators, and designed twenty-four differenttypes of machines that became standards which replaced those being used byEdison.68 At the same time, he worked on patents on arc lamps, regulators,dynamos, and commutators for DC apparatus, trying to devise a way to approachhis boss with his new invention, obtain a raise, and gain compensation for thelump sum he had allegedly been promised.The atmosphere was informal, Tesla occasionally dining with Edison, Batchelor,and other higher-ups, such as Edward Johnson, president of the EdisonIlluminating Company, or Harry Livor, another engineer and small-timeentrepreneur in machine-works manufacturing. Their favorite spot was a smallrestaurant opposite the Edison showroom at 65 Fifth Avenue. There they wouldswap stories and tell jokes.69 Afterward, some would retire to a billiard housewhere Tesla would impress the fellows with his bank shots and vision of thefuture.70Livor boasted of an agreement with Edison and Batchelor resulting in a companycapitalized at $10,000, formed for the manufacture of shafting. Edison andBatchelor provided the machinery and money, Livor, the tools and services.71Impressed, Tesla asked for advice, particularly how to obtain a raise from hispresent modest salary of eighteen dollars per week to a more lucrativetwenty-five dollars. “Livor gladly undertook this service…to intercede withBatchelor…but greatly to his surprise was met with an abrupt refusal.”“No,” replied Batchelor, “the woods are full of men like [Tesla]. I can get anynumber of them I want for $18 a week.” Tate, who began employment as Edison’ssecretary shortly after this episode, which Livor related to him, noted thatBatchelor “must have been referring to the woods I failed to find in thevicinity of Harlem.”72 Tesla’s version of the story is somewhat different: “Fornine months my hours [at the Edison Machine Works] were 10:30 A.M. till 5 A.M.the next day. All this time I was getting more and more anxious about theinvention [AC induction motor] and was making up my mind to place it beforeEdison. I still remember an odd incident in this connection. One day in thelatter part of 1884 Mr. Batchelor, the manager of the works, took me to ConeyIsland, where we met Edison in the company of his former wife. The moment that Iwas waiting for was propitious, and I was just about to speak, when ahorriblelooking tramp took hold of Edison and drew him away, preventing me fromcarrying out my intentions.”73In analyzing this story, a discrepancy as to the timing was discovered, forEdison’s wife caught typhoid fever in July 1884 and died on August 9. SinceTesla had arrived in May or June, and if Edison’s wife was present, then theevent took place in late June or early July, only a few weeks after he began hisemployment. In a close working environment, with the hours as described, even afew weeks could seem like a very long time. One way or another, with the deathof Edison’s wife and Edison’s extreme dislike of such AC men as Elihu Thomsonand George Westinghouse, no time for discussing an AC invention may have been“propitious.” The “horriblelooking tramp” who grabbed Edison away was probablyEdison himself, who was known to dress like a “Bowery bum,” Tesla using aeuphemism to soften the story. “The manager had promised me fifty thousanddollars [for redesigning equipment], but when I demanded payment, he merelylaughed. ‘You are still a Parisian,’ remarked Edison. ‘When you become afull-fledged American, you will appreciate an American joke.’”74If a “completion agreement”75 had truly been made with Edison, Tesla should havehad it put in writing. It seems unlikely that this amount of money for asomewhat ambiguous bargain would be offered, but it was well within Edison’snature to make “expensive if indefinite promises of rewards as a way of gettingthe men to work for low wages.” Edison, who could be more deaf than he actuallywas, at times, was known to “put on” his college-educated ‘sperts, as when heconvinced the chemist Martin Rosanoff that his first lightbulb filament was madeout of Limburger cheese! Deeply hurt, Tesla left the company and set out on hisown.76"},{"pageContent":"5LIBERTY STREET (1886-88) [002-toc.html#ch5]> There were many days when [I] did not know where my next meal was coming from.> But I was never afraid to work, I went to where some men were digging a> ditch…[and] said I wanted to work.

Simultaneously, it allowed Tesla to begin to organize his owncompany and write up first drafts in a notebook on advances in arc-lightingdesign and on the construction of DC commutators. It also enabled him to seethat Edison was mortal and fallible and that he, Tesla, had a schemesignificantly more advanced. A new confidence began to emerge.In March 1885, Tesla met with the well-established patent attorney LemuelSerrell, a former agent of Edison’s, and Serrell’s patent artist, RaphaelNetter.2 Serrell taught Tesla how to break down complex inventions intoindividualized improvements, and on the thirtieth of the month they applied forTesla’s first patent (no. 335,786), an improved design of the arc lamp whichcreated a uniform light and prevented flickering. In May and June they appliedfor other patents on improvements on the commutator for the prevention ofsparking and for regulating the current by means of a novel independent circuitcoupled with auxiliary brushes. In July yet another arc-lighting patent wasfiled. This one enabled exhausted lamps to automatically separate themselvesfrom the circuit until such time as the carbon filaments could be replaced.Unfortunately, the design had been anticipated by Elihu Thomson. Although“embarrassed” by having been unaware of the state of the art in America at thistime, Tesla was able to create novel refinements, and they were patentable.3During his trips to Serrell’s office, the inventor met with B. A. Vail andRobert Lane, two businessmen from New Jersey.4 With ambiguous assurances thatthey were also interested in the AC motor, Tesla agreed to form a lighting andmanufacturing company with them in Tesla’s name in Vail’s town of Rahway, NewJersey. There, after nearly a year of toil working with Paul Noyes, from GordonPress Works, he completed the installation; this, his first and only municipalarc-lighting system, was used to illuminate the streets of a town and somefactories.5 The efficiency and original approach of the system attracted theattention of George Worthington, editor of Electrical Review, who “tookpleasure” in featuring the company on the front page of the August 14, 1886,issue.For the next few months, the Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing Companyreciprocated by advertising in the journal. Vail hired the mechanical artist Mr.Wright of New York City to draw the lamp and dynamo and at the same time, alongwith Tesla’s help, created bold copy which claimed: “the most perfect…andentirely new [arc lighting] system of…automatic self-regulat[ion]” In a displayad four times the size of most other electrical concerns, the Tesla systemguaranteed “absolute safety and great saving of power…with no flickering orhissing.”6Having obtained stock in the company and with a little money in his pocket,Tesla moved into a garden apartment in Manhattan. Decorating the grounds “in thecontinental fashion with colored glass balls on sticks,” the cosmopolitan’sdelight was short-lived. “Children broke in and stole the balls, so Teslareplaced them with metal ones. The stealing continued, however, so Tesla orderedhis gardener to bring them into the house every night.”7Unfortunately, neither Vail, who was president of the company, nor Lane, who wasvice president and treasurer, cared about Tesla’s other creation. To them, an ACmotor was a seemingly useless invention. The sensitive inventor became incensed,for he had postponed exploiting the AC system until the Rahway project wascompleted under the assumption that his backers would support that quest aswell. To his shock, Tesla was forced out of his own concern and handed “thehardest blow I ever received.”8 “With no other possession than a beautifullyengraved certificate of stock of hypothetical value,”9 the inventor wasbankrupt. Betrayed by men he trusted, the inventor came to consider the winterof 1886-87 a time of “terrible headaches and bitter tears, my suffering beingintensified by my material want.”10 He was forced to work as a ditchdigger. Theoccupation was particularly demeaning for the self-perceived aristocrat. “Myhigh education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemedto me like a mockery.”11Tesla’s crisis abated in the spring. Having interested the foreman in hisengineering prowess, he was introduced to Alfred S. Brown, a prominent engineerwho worked for Western Union Telegraph Company. Brown, who himself held a numberof patents on arc lamps,12 had probably seen the article and advertisements onTesla in Electrical Review. Well aware of the limitations of the prevailing DCapparatus, he became immediately impressed with the “merits” of Tesla’s ACinventions and thereupon contacted Charles F. Peck, “a distinguished lawyer”from Englewood, New Jersey.13 Peck “knew of the failures in the industrialexploitation of alternating currents and was distinctly prejudiced to a point ofnot caring even to witness some tests.”“I was discouraged,” Tesla recalled, “until I had an inspiration. Do youremember the ‘Egg of Columbus?’ I asked. The saying goes that at a certaindinner the great explorer asked some scoffers of his project to balance an eggon its end. They tried in vain. He then took it, and cracking the shell slightlyby a gentle blow, made it stand upright. This may be a myth, but the fact isthat he was granted an audience by Isabella, the Queen of Spain, and won hersupport.”“And you plan to balance an egg on its end?” Peck inquired.“Yes, but without cracking the shell. If I should do this, would you admit thatI had gone Columbus one better?”“All right,” he said.Having finally gained the lawyer’s attention, Tesla cut to the quick. “And wouldyou be willing to go out of your way as much as Isabella?”“I have no crown jewels to pawn,” Peck retorted, “but there are a few ducats inmy buckskins and I might be able to help you to an extent.”14After the meeting, Tesla rushed to the local blacksmith with a hardboiled eggand had a mate cast in iron and brass. When he returned to the lab, heconstructed a circular enclosure with polyphase circuits along the perimeter,and when he placed the egg in the center and turned on the current, the eggbegan to spin. As the egg’s speed of rotation increased, its wobbling ceased,and it stood on its end. Not only was Tesla able to “go Columbus one better,” hewas also easily able to display the principles behind the idea of his rotatingmagnetic field. Peck was won over, and together the three men formed a newelectric company in Tesla’s name.Peck, who had connections with John C. Moore, a banker with connections to J. P.Morgan, provided the bulk of the capital, and Brown provided technical expertiseand located the laboratory at 89 Liberty Street, adjacent to what today is theWorld Trade Center. In return, Tesla agreed to split his patents on afifty-fifty basis. In actuality, the three equally shared one patent for an ACdynamo, Peck and Tesla split five more patents on commutators, motors, and powertransmission, and the balance of inventions conceived during this period wereplaced in the name of the Tesla Electric Company. Their first patent was filedon April 30, 1887.15 Finally, Tesla had arrived. He would begin an unprecedentedexcursion into the field of invention, a flow of intense activity which wouldcontinue unabated for fifteen years.Driven by his wish to maintain priority in a variety of areas and upon therealization that new technologies could influence the course of history, Teslabegan a vigorous schedule that frightened those around him. On many occasions,he drove himself until he collapsed, working around the clock, with few breaks.“Tesla produced as rapidly as the machines could be constructed three completesystems of AC machinery—for single-phase, two-phase, and three-phasecurrents—and made experiments with fourand six-phase currents. In each of thethree principal systems he produced the dynamos for generating the currents, themotors for producing power from them, and transformers for raising and reducingthe voltages as well as a variety of devices for automatically controlling themachinery. He not only produced the three systems but provided methods by whichthey could be interconnected and modifications providing a variety of means ofusing each of the systems.”16 He also calculated, in fundamental fashion, themathematics behind these inventions.On May 10, Anthony Szigeti landed in New York, and by the end of the week he wasworking at Liberty Street. With Tesla as designer, Brown as technical expert,and Szigeti as assistant, they began manufacturing their first AC inductionmotors. Peck, who along with Brown would be associated with Tesla for the nextdecade as a quiet backer, helped implement the patent applications by seeinginvestors in California, Pennsylvania, and New York.Within a few weeks, Electrical World editor T. C. Martin stopped by the shop andcoaxed Tesla into writing his first article on the invention. Immediately takenby him, Martin described the long-limbed electrician as having “eyes that recallall the stories one has read of keenness of vision and phenomenal ability to seethrough things. He is an omnivorous reader, who never forgets; and he possessesthe peculiar facility in languages that enables the educated native of easternEurope to talk and write in at least half a dozen tongues. A more congenialcompanion cannot be desired…the conversation, dealing at first with things nearat hand and next…reaches out and rises to the greater questions of life, andduty, and destiny.”17T. C. Martin, with heavy emphasis in his signature on the C, was a complexperson who would come to play a significant role in Tesla’s life. In 1893 heedited the most important compilation of Tesla’s writings assembled during hislifetime. Flamboyantly mustachioed and with large, round, soulful eyes and ashaved head, Martin, now married, had been a former seminary student who hademigrated from England when he was only twenty-one. Born in the same year asTesla, Martin had worked for the Wizard of Menlo Park in the late 1870s beforemoving to the island of Jamaica. Returning to New York in 1883, he quicklybecame editor of Operator and Electrical World. Started in 1874 by the wellmanicured W. J. Johnston from a “little four-page telegraph sheet prepared andissued by Western Union operators in New York City, for circulation among theirfellows,”18 the Operator began to gain prominence after Thomas Edison startedcontributing significant pieces. As soon as Martin was hired, the paper’s namewas changed simply to Electrical World.The following year, in 1884, T. C. Martin became vice president of the newlyformed American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), and in 1886 his firstbook appeared, The Electrical Motor and Its Applications. A few months later, hewas elected president of the AIEE.19With his newfound prominence and very British attitude, T. C. Martin’s sense ofself-worth rose to the occasion. In very deliberate fashion, he organized arebellion at Electrical World, with his coeditor Joseph Wetzler and a few otherworkers, against the owner, the proper, pedantic, and overbearing W. J.Johnston.20 A capable editor in his own right, Johnston was forced to fire hiseditors and work on the journal himself, “as if Martin had never existed.”Along with Wetzler, Martin gained employment with Electrical Engineer, acompeting company which gained great prominence when the duo climbed aboard. Asa friend of Edison, and with his new base of operations, Martin was prepared toseize the moment. “An industrious writer with graceful style,”21 T. C. Martinhad the capability to cross over into higher social circles. He was a leader, anopportunist, egoist, and charmer. He was also one of the most influentialpersonalities in the glamorous futuristic field of electrical engineering.Having discovered this new volcano of vision in Nikola Tesla, Martin approachedhim with the idea of helping choreograph Tesla’s entrée into theelectrical-engineering community.The Serb was mysterious. He could rebuff lesser mortals and enjoyed the habitsof a recluse. But Thomas Commerford Martin had tact and tenacity of purpose. Hehelped arrange for the esteemed engineering professor William Anthony, ofCornell University, to come to Liberty Street and test the new AC motors forefficiency. And Tesla reciprocated by traveling to Cornell to display his motorsto Anthony and three other professors, R. H. Thurston, Edward Nicholas, andWilliam Ryan. Anthony, who was twenty years their senior and a graduate of bothBrown and Yale universities, had just retired from Cornell after fifteen yearsin order to take a position designing electrical measuring instruments forMather Electrical Company in Manchester, Connecticut. Soon to be president ofthe AIEE himself, Anthony was pleased with his tests. Along with Martin, hehelped coax Tesla into presenting his motor before the newly formed electricalsociety.Martin had great difficulty persuading Tesla “to give any paper at all.” Martinsaid that “Tesla stood very much alone, [as] the majority [of the electricians]were entirely unfamiliar with [the motor’s] value.” In haste, Tesla wrote outhis lecture the night before in pencil. It had not been easy for him toconstruct an efficient machine, but having finally succeeded and having passedall of Professor Anthony’s stringent tests for efficiency, “nothing now stood inthe way of [its] commercial development…except that they had to be constructedwith a view to operating on the circuits then existing which in this countrywere all of high frequency.”22On May 15, 1888, Tesla appeared before the AIEE to read his landmark paper “ANew Alternating Current Motor.” He had already filed for fourteen of the fortyfundamental patents on the AC system, but he was still reluctant to fullyannounce his work. Realizing that the invention was worth at a minimum hundredsof thousands of dollars, Tesla and company sought investors through the adviceof their new patent attorneys, Parker W. Page, Leonard E. Curtis, and Gen.Samuel Duncan, the last a leader of the firm and respected member of the NewYork Bar Association.23 By the time of the lecture, Tesla, Peck, and Brown hadalready been negotiating with prospective buyers, such as Mr. Butterworth, a gasmanufacturer from San Francisco, and, through General Duncan, GeorgeWestinghouse of Pittsburgh,24 but nothing as yet was settled.Westinghouse was already utilizing an alternating current system developed bythe “erratic” French inventor Lucien Gaulard and the “sporty” entrepreneur JohnDixon Gibbs of England.25 In 1885 his manager of the electrical division, GuidoPantaleoni, had returned to Turin, Italy, to attend the funeral of his father.By coincidence, through his engineering professor Galileo Ferraris, whomWestinghouse himself had met while visiting Italy in 1882, Pantaleoni wasintroduced to Lucian Gaulard, who had installed his AC apparatus between Tivoliand Rome. Gaulard and Gibbs had already made headlines two years earlier whenthey first exhibited their invention at the Royal Aquarium in London; but inTurin the system won a gold medal and a prize of £400 awarded by the Italiangovernment. Westinghouse purchased the American patent rights in late Novemberafter receiving a cable request from Pantaleoni.The Gaulard-Gibbs system, although improved by the Hungarian ZBD system, stillhad serious problems. For Westinghouse, this was further complicated by the factthat Edison owned the option on the ZBD; and it was probably to blockcompetitors that Edison purchased the system to begin with.26In the same year, in America, after creating the Westinghouse Electric Company,Westinghouse placed William Stanley in charge of the Gaulard-Gibbsmodifications. Simultaneously, he brought to America Reginald Belfield, theengineer who had helped install the Gaulard-Gibbs system at the InventionsExhibition in London two years earlier. Stanley, a frail, thin-facedtemperamental “little man”27 with piercing eyes, aquiline nose, wispy mustache,and Alfalfa hairdo, was a native of Brooklyn who had worked for Hiram Maxim,inventor of the machine gun. Although it was Westinghouse’s idea to placeStanley in charge of the Gaulard-Gibbs apparatus, Stanley would later maintainthat Westinghouse never fully understood the system until he got it in workingorder.28 This appears unlikely, for it was a private joke among the upperechelon of the Westinghouse Company that Stanley had a penchant for claiming newdiscoveries when they became such to him. In any case, Westinghouse hedged hisbets by establishing numerous DC central stations as well while research on ACwas in progress.29“Nervous and agile,”30 Stanley was a hypersensitive individual who never reallygot along with Westinghouse. Due to ill health, and on the advice of the generalmanager, Col. Henry Byllesby, who proposed that success might be moreforthcoming if Stanley separated himself from the pressures of the company, theinventor returned to his childhood summer retreat in the Berkshires in GreatBarrington, Massachusetts, to work on the Gaulard-Gibbs system in private,taking Reginald Belfield with him. Stanley converted the Gaulard-Gibbsarrangement to parallel circuitry and independent control of separate fixturesand at the same time created a transformer which stepped up the AC from 500volts to 3,000 when delivered along a transmission line and stepped them backdown to original levels when entering households. This invention, although verysimilar to the ZBD configuration, was nevertheless patentable. It enabled AC tobe sent three-quarters of a mile, or approximately one-quarter of a mile fartherthan the lower voltages of the prevailing DC systems.31On April 6, 1886, George Westinghouse, along with Col. Henry Byllesby, traveledup to New Hampshire to witness the landmark apparatus for themselves. Prior tocoming to Westinghouse, Byllesby had been employed at the Edison Machine Worksas a mechanical engineer and was one of the designers of the Pearl Streetstation.32 “From that time on,” Byllesby said, “we progressed with amazingspeed.”33 By the time of Tesla’s lecture, Westinghouse noted that his companyhad “sold more central station[s]…on the alternating current system than all ofthe other electric companies in the country put together on the direct currentsystem,”34 but few engineers understood the principles involved.In fierce competition with Westinghouse and a third player, Elihu Thomson ofThomson-Houston Electric Company, Thomas Edison had received a report on his ownalternating current ZBD system. His engineers in Berlin indicated that the useof such high voltages was exceedingly dangerous.35 Thomson, who himself hadlectured at the AIEE a year before on the topic of AC, supported Edison’scontention that AC was too risky.36 Thus, at the time Tesla spoke, the battle ofthe currents had already begun, but the makeup of the contenders was complex. In1886, fully two years before Tesla’s high-voltage AC system became manifest,Edison had written to his manager, “Just as certain as death Westinghouse willkill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He hasgot a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get itworking practically. It will never be free from danger.”37Tesla’s lecture began with a brief description of the “existing diversity ofopinion regarding the relative merits of the alternate and continuous currentsystems. Great importance,” Tesla continued, “is attached to the questionwhether alternate currents can be successfully utilized in the operation ofmotors.” He followed this preamble with a lucid description of the problems ofthe prevailing technology and his elegant solution, explained in words,diagrams, and simple mathematical calculations. The lecture was so thorough thatmany engineers, after studying the work, felt that they had known it all along:> I have the pleasure of bringing to your notice a novel system of electric> distribution and transmission of power by means of alternate currents…which I> am confident will at once establish the superior adaptability…and will show> that many results heretofore unattainable can be reached by their use…> > In our dynamo machines, it is well known, we generate alternate currents which> we direct by means of a commutator, a complicated device, and the source of> most of the troubles experienced…Now, the currents so directed cannot be> utilised in the motor, but they must be reconverted into their original> state…In reality, therefore, all machines are alternate-current machines, the> current appearing continuous only in the external circuit during their transit> from generator to motor.38Since Tesla’s lecture was dealing with fundamentals, it was easily understood,even though his invention was so revolutionary.By demonstration in Tesla’s laboratory after the lecture, the inventor showedthat his synchronous motors could almost instantaneously be reversed. He alsodescribed, in precise mathematical calculations, how to determine the number ofpoles and speed of each motor, how to construct single-phase, two-phase, andthree-phase motors, and how his system could be interlinked with DC apparatus.The lecture made use of entirely new principles.39Now electricity could be transported hundreds of miles from a singledistribution point, and not just for lighting streets or dwellings but forrunning appliances in households and industrial machinery in factories.At the end of the talk, T. C. Martin called upon Professor William Anthony topresent his independent tests of the Tesla motors. He had designed dynamoshimself, which he had displayed a decade earlier at the Philadelphia Expositionof 1876. Tugging nervously at his scraggly beard, Anthony confirmed that theTesla motors he had taken back to Cornell had an efficiency comparable to thebest DC apparatus. “A little over 60%,” he said, for the larger models.Moreover, the reversal of direction that the machines could achieve took place“so quickly that it was almost impossible to tell when the change took place.”40Boiling inside at having been anticipated by a newcomer, the persnicketyprofessor Elihu Thomson stepped forward. Wanting to reestablish that his work inAC predated Tesla’s, Thomson pointed out how their inventions differed: “I havebeen very much interested in the description given by Mr. Tesla of his new andadmirable little motor,” he managed with a pert smile. “I have, as probably youmay be aware, worked in somewhat similar directions, and towards the attainmentof similar ends. The trials which I have made have been by the use of a singlealternating current circuit—not a double alternating circuit—a single circuitsupplying a motor constructed to utilize the alternation and producerotation.”41Unbeknown to Thomson, his words at that moment would come back to haunt him,because he had identified precisely the difference between the two creations.Whereas Thomson’s single AC circuit had to still make use of a commutator andthus was highly inefficient, Tesla’s system utilized two or more circuits out ofphase with each other and constructed in such a way as to make the commutatorobsolete. Tesla, of course, recognized the importance of Thomson’s words andreiterated the point to establish clearly that his invention, just presented,was not analogous to Thomson’s prior work:“Gentlemen,” Tesla began, “I wish to say that the testimony of such a man asProfessor Thomson flatters me very much.” Pausing with a smile and a bow ofrecognition, Tesla timed his coup de grâce with understated finesse. “I had amotor identically the same as that of Professor Thomson, but I was anticipatedby him…That peculiar motor represents the disadvantage that a pair of brushes[i.e., a commutator] must be employed.”42In this brief riposte Tesla claimed the high ground, and created an enemy whowould fight him on this and other priority issues (e.g., the Tesla coil) for therest of their lives.Now Westinghouse had to move fast. He realized the value of the Tesla patentapplications, having had nearly a month to look them over, along with the reportfrom Professor Anthony.43 A week after the lecture, on May 21, he sent Col.Henry Byllesby to Tesla’s laboratory. Byllesby met with fellow engineer AlfredBrown on Cortland Street, where he was introduced to Charles Peck, the lawyerand major financial backer of the Tesla Electric Company. Together with a fourthman, Mr. Humbard, they went over to Liberty Street to meet the inventor and seethe machines in operation.“Mr. Tesla struck me as being a straight-forward, enthusiastic, sort of aparty,” Byllesby wrote to Westinghouse, “but his description was not of a naturewhich I was enabled, entirely, to comprehend. However, I saw several pointswhich I think are of interest. In the first place, as near as I can get at it,the underlying principle of this motor is the principle which Mr. Shallenbergeris at work on at the present moment. The motors, as far as I could judge…are asuccess. They start from rest, and the reversion of the direction of rotation issuddenly accomplished without any shortcircuiting…In order to avoid giving theimpression that the matter was one which excited my curiosity, I made my visitshort.”44Back at Cortland Street, Brown and Peck informed Byllesby that he had to make adecision “by ten o’clock, Friday of this week,” as the company was alsonegotiating with a Mr. Butterworth from San Francisco. They claimed thatProfessor Anthony had joined this California syndicate and was backing upButterworth’s offer of $250,000 in short-term notes and a royalty of $2.50 perwatt of horsepower. “I told them the terms were monstrous,” Byllesby said, “butthey replied that they could not possibly hold the matter over longer than thedate mentioned. I told them I thought there was no possibility of ourconsidering the matter seriously, but that I would let them know before Friday.”Byllesby suggested that Westinghouse come to New York himself or sendShallenberger and another representative, but Westinghouse, who was familiarwith the San Francisco syndicate, told Byllesby instead to stall them and try tosecure more favorable terms.45During the six-week interim, Westinghouse conferred with his specialists, OliverShallenberger and William Stanley, and his lawyer E. M. Kerr. Just three weeksprior to Tesla’s lecture, Shallenberger had discovered “by chance” that a loosespring spun in “a shifting magnetic field. Directly he said to his assistantStillwell who was also present…, ‘There’s a meter in that and perhaps a motor.’Within two weeks he designed and built a most successful alternating currentmeter of the induction type” which became standard for the field; and, likeTesla’s creation, his apparatus utilized a rotating magnetic field.46Shallenberger, however, did not yet really understand the principles involved,nor had he had time to apply for a patent.Stanley, on the other hand, claimed that there was nothing new in Tesla’screation. He pointed out that in September 1883 he had put the idea down in anotebook that an induction coil could be excited by AC. “I have built an ACsystem on basically the same principle which allows electromotive force to betransmitted from power stations to homes for the purpose of illuminating them,”he told Westinghouse.47 But the fact of the matter was, Stanley’s system stillused a commutator. His ego had gotten in the way of his ability to reasonobjectively that his scheme was not analogous to Tesla’s.Kerr reminded Westinghouse that unless he had a competing patent of sufficientstrength, he would be powerless. Westinghouse was aware that Professor Ferrarisof Turin, Italy, had published a paper on the rotating magnetic field one or twomonths prior to Tesla’s lecture. Ferraris had also constructed discs thatrotated in AC fields in university presentations as early as 1885. Teslawillingly admitted that “Professor Ferraris not only came independently to thesame theoretical results, but in a manner identical almost to the smallestdetail,”48 but Ferraris wrongly concluded that “an apparatus founded upon thisprinciple cannot be of any commercial importance as a motor.”49 Nevertheless,Kerr realized the legal importance of Ferraris’s work. He suggested toWestinghouse that they purchase the U.S. patent options, so Pantaleoni was sentto Italy. He paid 5,000 francs, or about $1,000, for the rights.50 But time wasrunning out; the Tesla people would not wait forever. Westinghouse wrote Kerr:> I have been thinking over this motor question very considerably, and am of the> opinion that if Tesla has a number of applications pending in the Patent> Office, he will be able to cover broadly the apparatus that Shallenberger was> experimenting with, and that Stanley thought he had invented. It is more than> likely that he will be able to carry his date of invention back sufficient> time to seriously interfere with Ferraris, and that our investment there will> probably prove a bad one.> > If the Tesla patents are broad enough to control the alternating motor> business, then the Westinghouse Electric Company cannot afford to have others> own the patents.51Concerning the sticky point of royalties, which the Tesla syndicate placed atthe audacious figure of $2.50 per watt, Westinghouse wrote, “The price seemsrather high, but if it is the only method for operating a motor by thealternating current, and if it is applicable to street car work, we canunquestionably easily get from the users of the apparatus whatever tax is putupon it by the inventors.”52 Thus, in no uncertain terms, Westinghouse writeshere the portentous statement that royalty payments could be passed on tocustomers, a concept he would be forced later to conveniently overlook."},{"pageContent":"6INDUCTION AT PITTSBURGH (1889) [002-toc.html#ch6]> [My] first impression [was that of a man with] tremendous potential energy of> [which]…only part had taken kinetic form.

He was a descendant of thearistocratic Russian von Wistinghousen family; his father was also an inventor,with six fundamental patents of farming machinery. With his brother Henry (wholater became his partner), George early on was introduced to such devices as thebattery and the sparking leyden jar (a glass jar lined with foil and used forstoring an electric charge). Having been a cavalry boy and, later, a navyengineer during the Civil War, George Westinghouse had experience and vision; heknew that the future was in electricity.In late July 1888, Tesla took a train to Pittsburgh to meet with GeorgeWestinghouse and finalize the sale of his patents. It may have been the middleof summer, but oddly, the inventor welcomed the intense heat. He looked forwardto the meeting.Considerable in stature, with a walrus-sized mustache, Chester A. Arthursideburns, and a remarkable wife of equal proportion who wore a bustle thatjutted three feet to the rear, Westinghouse greeted the lanky inventor. Agarrulous man, George Westinghouse subsumed those around him with his genialityand unbounded confidence. He took Tesla to his home and then on a tour of theplant. With nearly four hundred employees, Westinghouse’s electric company wasmainly producing “alternators, transformers and accessories for equippingcentral stations for supplying incandescent lighting.”2 Barrel-chested andphysically expansive, Westinghouse counterbalanced in appearance thespindle-legged foreigner, who walked as “straight as an arrow, [with his] headerect…but with a preoccupied air as if new combinations were crystallizing inhis brain.”3> Tesla said:> > > > Though past forty then, [Westinghouse] still had the enthusiasm of youth.> Always smiling, affable and polite, he stood in marked contrast to the rough> and ready men I met. Not one word which would have been objectionable, not a> gesture which might have offended—one could imagine him as moving in the> atmosphere of a court, so perfect was his bearing in manner and speech. And> yet no fiercer adversary than Westinghouse could have been found when he was> aroused. An athlete in ordinary life, he was transformed into a giant when> confronted with difficulties which seemed unsurmountable. He enjoyed the> struggle and never lost confidence. When others would give up in despair he> triumphed.4Known for his foresight and courage, Westinghouse had already quadrupled thesales of his electric company, from $800,000 in 1887 to over $3 million in 1888,even though he was in the midst of expensive legal and propaganda battles withEdison.5 Extraordinary in his ability to generate enthusiasm in his workers anda decisive man of action, he immediately gained the respect of those he met,particularly Nikola Tesla.Westinghouse offered Tesla $5,000 in cash for a sixty-day option, $10,000 at theend of the option if they elected to purchase the patents, three notes of$20,000 at six-month intervals, $2.50 per watt in royalties, and two hundredshares of stock in the Westinghouse Company. Minimum payment on the royaltieswas calculated at “$5,000 for the first year, $10,000 for the second year, and$15,000 for each succeeding year thereafter during the life of the patents.”6Westinghouse also agreed to pay for any legal expenses in litigation on priorityissues, but a clause for lowering payments was added should any suits be lost.Calculated out, for fifteen years, this figure, minus the stock, came to $75,000in initial outlays and $180,000 in royalty payments, or approximately $255,000.7Tesla owned four-ninths of his company, the balance shared by Peck and Brown,presumably three-ninths to the former partner and two ninths to the latter.8Concerning total amounts paid out by Westinghouse, Tesla also referred toEuropean patents, especially in England and Germany.9 Thus, it is hard todetermine exactly how much Tesla received for his forty patents. Westinghousewas not only getting a simple induction motor but also a variety of synchronousand load-dependent motors as well as armatures, turbines, regulators, anddynamos. Tesla may have sold additional inventions later on in separateagreements; the value of his stock holding is also unclear.A decade later, Tesla wrote to another financier, John Jacob Astor, that “Mr.Westinghouse agreed to pay for my rotating field patents about $500,000, and,despite…hard times, he has lived up to every cent of his obligation.”10 SinceTesla was trying to raise money from Astor, he may have exaggerated the sum. Twoyears earlier, Electrical Review noted that the Westinghouse annual reportlisted the purchase of the patents at $216,000,11 which is a figure thatcorresponds roughly to the Byllesby memorandum above, minus a few years’ worthof royalty payments. If this was the case, then Tesla probably received forhimself about half that figure, or $100,000, the entire amount paid ininstallments during the years 1888-97.12During the negotiations, Tesla agreed to move to Pittsburgh to help develop hismotor. It is quite possible that he received no salary for his stay there, forhe had a peculiar “principle, ever since I devoted myself to scientificlaboratory research, never to accept fees or compensations for professionalservices.”13 Tesla had been paid for his patents and was receiving royalties (orpayments against royalties), so there was an income. Further evidence that noadditional daily or weekly compensation was received is implied in a signedagreement by George Westinghouse, dated July 27, 1889, substantiating that Teslaworked in Pittsburgh for one year and that during that time he was paid with“one hundred and fifty (150) shares of Capital Stock.” In return, Tesla promisedto assign any patents to the Westinghouse Company which were directly related tothe development of his induction motor patents. Other compensation was receivedfrom Westinghouse, however, for other contributions. For instance, when Tesladiscovered that Bessemer steel created a vastly superior transformer than onesmade out of soft iron, Tesla was paid approximately $10,000 for the idea.14Tesla gave up his garden apartment in New York and moved into one of severalhotels in Pittsburgh, including the Metropolitan, the Duquesne, and theAnderson.15 Hotel living would become a lifestyle which he never departed from.His talk, just two months old, had already catapulted him to fame. “About themiddle of August 1888 in the Westinghouse testing room at Pittsburgh,” CharlesScott, his assistant to be, remembered: “I had just come with the company andwas assistant to E. Spooner who was running the dynamos testing room at night.He called me and said, ‘There comes Tesla.’“I had heard of Tesla,” Scott continued, having “read [Tesla’s] paper on thepolyphase induction motor which my former college professor had pronounced as acomplete solution of the motor problem. And now I was to see Tesla himself.”Fair-haired, with round, rimless glasses, Scott had only learned “that there wassuch a thing as alternating current” the summer before, in 1887. “Ihad…graduated from college two years earlier, and I wondered why I had not heardof such things from my professors.” His only introduction was an ElectricalWorld article by William Stanley, which was “a fascinating…key to manymysteries.”16 Now, a year later, he was to meet Nikola Tesla, the man who soelegantly solved all the puzzles proposed by Stanley. “There he came, marchingdown the aisle with head and shoulders erect and with a twinkle in his eye. Itwas a great moment for me.”17Scott, who later became an engineering professor at Yale University, was“Tesla’s wireman…in preparing and making tests. It was a splendid opportunityfor a beginner, this coming in contact with a man of such eminence, rich inideas, kindly and friendly in disposition. Tesla’s fertile imagination oftenconstructed air castles which seemed prodigious. But, I doubt whether ever hisextravagant expectations for the toy motor of those days measured up to actualrealization…for the polyphase system which it inaugurated…exceed[ed] the wildestdreams of the early day[s].”18Scott was not only Tesla’s assistant, as time went on and against the opinion ofmany colleagues, he became a champion of Tesla’s cause, a bearer of the truth,that is, that Tesla was the inventor of the induction motor. Another staunchsupporter was Swiss immigrant Albert Schmid, coauthor of two AC patents withTesla. Even though Westinghouse himself was also an ally, there was a bevy ofother workers who tried seriously to strip Tesla of the crown. Major adversariesof the early period included Oliver Shallenberger, inventor of the AC meter, andhis helpmate Lewis B. Stillwell, inventor of the Stillwell booster, whichoperated somewhat like the Tesla coil. At a later period, the key antagonist wasAndrew W. Robertson, Westinghouse’s chief executive officer.Yet another opponent was William Stanley, the first American to have eversuccessfully instituted an AC system in the country. Stanley had split off fromthe Westinghouse Corporation (circa 1892-93) in order to sell his own polyphasemotors, which were clear patent infringements on the Tesla system. This positionwas supported by the courts a few years later, and Stanley was forced topurchase the Tesla motors from Westinghouse.19To fathom the depth of hostility that existed within the Westinghouse campagainst Tesla, one need only read Lewis B. Stillwell’s chapter on the history ofalternating current, written forty years after the fact in a text entitledGeorge Westinghouse Commemoration. Edited by Charles Scott, the book was widelydistributed by the corporation and reissued in 1985. In the introduction toStillwell’s chapter it is recounted> how Westinghouse brought the Gaulard-Gibbs system to America, how it was> modified, and then given practical demonstrations by Stanley…and what has> happened since.> > In 1888 came Shallenberger’s brilliant invention of the induction meter. In> the same year Nikola Tesla was granted his United States patents covering the> polyphase motor and system. Westinghouse promptly secured the American rights.> Tesla came to Pittsburgh to develop his motor. He made vain attempts to adapt> it to the existing single phase, 133-cycle circuits…The obvious advantages> [emphasis added] of direct connection of engines and generators called for a> lower frequency…Two were selected as standard, namely 60 cycles for general> use and 30 cycles for conversion into direct current.20If we analyze the structure of this Stillwell quote, we note that although thetopic sentence refers to Shallenberger, the entire paragraph is about Tesla. Theword brilliant is used to describe an accidental discovery that a spring reactedto alternating currents21 when no adjective is used to describe the inventor ofan entire power system!Tesla refers to the same situation in his autobiography: “My system was based onthe use of low frequency currents and the Westinghouse experts had adopted 133cycles with the object of securing advantages in transformation [because theirGaulard-Gibbs system operated at that frequency]. They did not want to departfrom the standard form of apparatus and my efforts had to be concentrated uponadapting the motor to their conditions.”22With 120 power plants set up at 133 cycles per second, one can understand thepredicament Tesla was placed in. Since Shallenberger’s meter was compatible withthe prevailing 133-cycle single circuit, it appeared logical that Tesla’spolyphase motor could be made compatible as well.In December 1888, Edison’s propaganda battle against Westinghouse peaked whenEdison began to allow H. P. Brown (who was not an Edison employee) to come tohis Menlo Park laboratory in order to electrocute various animals with AC. A fewmonths earlier, Brown had experimented in electrocuting animals at the School ofMines, a division of Columbia University, in New York City. Brown, an electricalengineer who lived on Fifty-fourth Street, had become upset over the manyaccidental deaths of his colleagues. He had collected a list of over eightycasualties, and although many of the men died because of DC, Brown decided thatAC was the real culprit. Within two years, Brown began to manufacture electricchairs for various prisons which he sold for $1,600. He also planned to get paidto be the executioner. During the summer of 1888 the New York Times reportedthat he “tortured and electrocuted a dog…First try[ing] continuous currents at aforce of 300 volts…when the shock came the dog yelped…At 700 volts he broke hismuzzle and nearly freed himself. He was tied again. At 1,000 his body contortedin pain…‘We will have less trouble when we try alternating current,’ Mr. Brownsaid. It was proposed that he put the dog out of its misery at once. This wasdone on an alternating current of 300 volts killing the beast.”23A number of cities had adopted electrocution to rid the streets of unwantedcanines, but the state of New York went a step further and set up a commissionin 1886 “to report…on the most humane method of capital punishment.”24 Under theauspices of the Medico-Legal Society of New York, Brown arose as chiefspokesman.William Kemmler, a hooligan who had axed his mistress to death, became the testcase for the use of electricity as a means of capital punishment.Ostensibly, because the Westinghouse motors could produce the more deadlyfrequency, Brown surreptitiously purchased some working models in order tocontinue his gruesome experiments. Naturally, Westinghouse was upset over thedevastating publicity. He and Tesla faced the possibility that the new ACpolyphase system might never succeed in competition with existing AC and DCtechnologies, as both former systems required much lower voltages.As Brown prepared to experiment with larger animals in order to assure thecommission that electricity could kill criminals in a “humane” way, the Kemmlertrial proceeded to question various electrical experts on the use of theWestinghouse currents for the electric chair.Edison saw the controversy as a slick way to capitalize on the campaign againstWestinghouse and the new Tesla technology. “Edison’s scheme for electricalexecution of criminals is the best so far presented. He proposes to manacle thewrists, with chain connections, place…the culprit’s hands in a jar of waterdiluted with caustic potash and connected therein…to a thousand volts ofalternating current…place the black cap on the condemned, and at a proper timeclose the circuit. The shock passes through both arms, the heart and the base ofthe brain, and death is instantaneous and painless.”25Able to fuel his vendetta, Edison provided access to his famous laboratory forBrown to “Westinghouse” twenty-four dogs, which he purchased from the localchildren at twenty-five cents apiece. Edison also “Westinghoused” two calves anda horse!26Perturbed, George Westinghouse wrote a letter of appeal to the New York Timeswhich stated that AC was no more dangerous than DC, since people have beenshocked and injured by DC as well.27 Westinghouse assured the public of thesafety of his system; so Brown, also in the Times, challenged Westinghouse a fewdays later “to meet me in the presence of the competent electrical experts andtake through his body the alternating current while I take through mine acontinuous current. The A.C. must have not less than 300 alternations persecond.”28On July 23, 1889, Edison was questioned under oath by Kemmler’s attorney, W.Bourke Cockran, an Irish immigrant schooled in France, in his second term in theHouse of Representatives. Having gained a reputation locally for fightingTammany Hall, Cockran had also achieved national recognition as the “Boy Orator”for taking on William Jennings Bryan’s presidential opponent, William McKinleyin well-covered debates. Now he set his sights on tackling the Wizard of MenloPark.29> QUESTION: Has Harold P. Brown any connection with yourself or the Edison> Company?> > EDISON: Not that I know of…> > QUESTION: What would happen in case Kemmler should be kept on the chair> several minutes with the current working on him?…Would he be carbonized?> > EDISON: No. He would be mummyized…> > QUESTION: This is your belief, not from knowledge?> > EDISON: From belief. I never killed anybody…“Finally, Mr. Cockran alluded to the rivalry between the Edison and theWestinghouse Companies and asked Mr. Edison if he loved Mr. Westinghouse as abrother. There was more than usual stillness, followed by Edison’s answer: ‘Ithink Mr. Westinghouse is a very able man.’…Mr. Cockran gave the ‘wizard’ alight from his cigar stump he had been chewing and dismissed him.”30It would be another full year before the actual execution took place, but publicopinion continued to run against the dangerous Westinghouse current. AlthoughEdison did not author the electric-chair ideas, he did everything he could tohelp the cause, providing his staff, especially the ingenious A. E. Kennelly,later a professor at Harvard, to aid Brown; in addition, he lent his name.Outcries began to appear in various periodicals concerning the “electricalexecutioners.” For example, the following editorial was published in a number ofthe papers and journals: “It is hard to conceive of a more horrible experimentthan that which will be made on Kemmler…In a secret place, he will be compelledto go through a process of mental and moral, if not also, bodily torture andnobody can tell how long it will last.”31This ominous passage actually was not severe enough, for the execution ofKemmler became a nightmare. The job was completely bungled when, afterelectrocution, “to the horror of all present, the chest began to heave, foamissued from the mouth, and the man gave every evidence of reviving.”32The execution was likened to the work of barbarians and torturers and to scenes“worthy of the darkest chambers of the Inquisition of the 16th Century.” Oneeyewitness who was completely disgusted was Dr. Jenkins, who told the New YorkTimes, “I would rather see ten hangings than one such execution as this.” Topelectricians were also interviewed.“I do not care to talk about it,” Westinghouse said. “It was a brutal affair.They could have done better with an axe.”Even Edison was affected. “I have merely glanced over an account of Kemmler’sdeath,” he said, “and it is not pleasant reading…One mistake in my opinion wasin leaving everything to the doctors…In the first place the hair on Kemmler’shead was non-conductive. Then the top of the head I do not believe a good placeto give a shock…The better way is to place the hands in ajar of water…and to letthe current be turned on there…I think when the next man is placed in the chairto suffer the death penalty that death will be accomplished instantly andwithout the scenes at Auburn today.”33Although Westinghouse tried to distance himself from the nefarious deeds, hiscompany still suffered greater damage than Edison’s from a publicity standpointbecause it was AC that was used to electrocute Kemmler. Mass hysteria threatenedto overpower the attempt to institute the new Tesla AC invention, let alone theprevailing Gaulard-Gibbs AC system.Tesla realized that eventually the company would have to come around to thelower frequencies if they wanted to use his creation, but to his shock, “in1890, the induction motor work was abandoned.”34Westinghouse let it be known that his hands were tied, that his backers wouldnot continue throwing tens of thousands of dollars away on futile research. Theyhad given Tesla a fair chance to alter his equipment to satisfy the needs of thecompany. It seemed folly to destroy all prevailing equipment to satisfy theuntried requirements of this new technology. Furthermore, they were against theidea of paying royalties should the motor eventually prove profitable. Enoughwas enough.In a quandary, Tesla negotiated with Westinghouse a compromise solution. Hewould abandon the royalty clause of the contract if Westinghouse promised tocommit his workers once again to the invention.Westinghouse was in a corner. He knew that he had to curtail all work on themotor at this time to satisfy the tide of hostility that was rising againstTesla. He also realized that the invention was too important, and he believedthat eventually a solution would be found. No one knows for sure exactly whathappened, but it appears that Westinghouse made a tacit commitment to Tesla thathe would get the company to resume work on the motor if Tesla removed the$2.50-per-watt royalty clause in the contract. If the motor came on the marketand the polyphase system was adopted, the yearly figures cited above, aspayments against royalties (worth approximately $255,000), would be honoredinstead.Tesla was aware of the historical importance of his invention. He realized thatit would alter the world beneficially in measurable ways. His motor, forinstance, would provide an inexpensive replacement for potentially hundreds ofthousands of hours of manual labor. At the same time, his creation would carvehis name deep into the history books, alongside such heroes as Archimedes andFaraday. Moreover, he knew that his system was the most efficient, that it wasfundamental, and that, if adopted, it would prevail. He also wanted very much toresume his preferred path of pioneer inventor.Tesla was not counting out debits and credits on a balance sheet; rather, heviewed his partnership with Westinghouse in a more flexible way. He was alsonegotiating in good faith and assumed that if he lightened the potentialfinancial burden, the company would somehow reciprocate. By offering goodwill,he was hoping to reap what he had sown. Speaking of Westinghouse many yearslater, Tesla said: “George Westinghouse was, in my opinion, the only man on theglobe who could take my alternating current system under the circumstances thenexisting and win the battle against prejudice and money power. He was a pioneerof imposing stature and one of the world’s noblemen.”35This, however, was a public statement; his private feelings were more complex.It is clear from reading through decades of letters to the corporation thatTesla maintained a close relationship with Westinghouse. Yet often there wereundercurrents of resentment due mainly to lack of appreciation by theWestinghouse concern of Tesla’s sacrifice and continuing contribution to thecompany. Tesla was also upset because the full scope of his patents becamesimplified and implications arose to suggest that he merely invented aninduction motor and not an entire power system.Finally, after nearly two years of inactivity, the Westinghouse people resumedtheir efforts to make the Tesla motor practicable. In 1891, Benjamin Lamme, aportly, easygoing, but studious youngster, began to reexamine Tesla’s patentsand Tesla and Scott’s experimental motors. After conversing with Tesla in NewYork and talking over the matter with Scott, Lamme approached his overseers witha plan to resume work on the motor.Lamme realized that Tesla had “exhausted all the possibilities” of trying toadapt his motor to the higher frequencies and that he was forced to “return to[the] low frequencies…insist[ing] on the superiority of his polyphase system.”36This idea, as stated above, was rejected—most likely by Shallenberger andStillwell. Lamme, as the junior engineer, had to proceed carefully. With Scott’said, he “finally obtained permission” to take up the work on his own, althoughthere is little doubt that a number of officials opposed the idea. “By thistime, the 60-cycle system was coming in quite rapidly,” Lamme said, so hesuggested this frequency to the staff. Shallenberger “lost his temper and talkedsome plain-language to me.” No doubt he said that there would be no possible waythat they would utilize the lower frequencies. “This looked pretty serious tome, who as a mere boy in the test room, had got into a row with a chieftechnical authority of the company. I explained my situation to Mr. Schmid whosimply laughed about it…However, somewhat to my surprise, Mr. Shallenbergeralways took my part, thereafter…This, of course, gave me a larger idea of theman himself; and I have always looked back with the greatest pleasure to myacquaintanceship with such a man.”What happened, most likely, is that Schmid, along with Scott, went behind thescenes and explained to Shallenberger that here was their opportunity to finallymake use of the motor without giving any more credit to Tesla. They would simplylet it be known that a new and brilliant engineer working at the company had“discovered” the efficiencies of lower frequencies, and so the credit would goto Lamme. No wonder Schmid laughed about it. With a way out, Shallenbergerreversed himself and patted Lamme on the back, Lamme somewhat naively concludingthat he built “the first induction motor…which bears any close example to themodern type…I [also]…designed the great generators for Niagara which werewithout precedent. They were marvels of engineering achievement.”37 Havingrediscovered what Tesla had suggested all along, Lamme often made it seem asthough he were the originator of the idea.Uneducated readers, left with incomplete source materials, of which there aremany, were forced to conclude that when it comes to the AC polyphase system, itwas “that versatile genius B. G. Lamme, [who was the]…pillar of the Westinghousecompany” who made it possible.38 But people who read Scott carefully knew thetruth: “Strenuous efforts to adapt the Tesla motor to [the prevailing] circuitwere in vain. The little motor insisted in getting what it wanted, and themountain came to Mohamet.”39"},{"pageContent":"7BOGUS INVENTORS (1889-90) [002-toc.html#ch7]> Keely has discovered that all sympathetic streams, cerebellic, gravital,> magnetic, and electric, are composed of triple flows; this fact governing all> the terrestrial and celestial orders of positive and negative radiation…He has> discovered that the range of molecular motion in all quiescent masses is equal> to one-third of their diameters, and that all extended range is induced by> sound-force, set at chords of the thirds which are antagonistic to the> combined chords of the mass of the neutral centres that they represent.> > “Who Is the Greatest Genius of Our Age?”> > REVIEW OF REVIEWS, 18901Tesla left Pittsburgh in the autumn of 1889 to return to New York and start hissecond laboratory, now on Grand Street. There he would begin work on highfrequency apparatus, wireless transmission, and theories on the relationshipbetween electromagnetic radiation and light. In particular, the inventor wantedto replicate the findings of the German academician Heinrich Hertz, a student ofHermann Ludwig von Helmholtz’s who had recently published his landmarkexperiments in wave propagation. Tesla said that this work “caused a thrill ashad scarcely ever been experienced before.”2 “I was not free at Pittsburgh,” hecontinued. “I was dependent and could not work…When I [left] that situationideas and inventions rushed through my brain like a Niagara.”3Before he set up shop, the inventor traveled to Paris to attend the UniversalExposition and witness the unveiling of a gargantuan architectural triumph, theEiffel Tower. Returning to a city filled with fond memories, Tesla could sayhello to old friends and tell them how far he had come. There the buddingcreator could stop once again at the Louvre to gaze upon the “marvels” ofRaphael, his self-perceived counterpart in the fine arts.4 Nevertheless, Teslaalso had mixed feelings, as he was traveling in the shadow of his nemesis,Thomas Edison, who not only attended the fair but who also provided a one-acresite for displaying his various inventions. In particular, the phonographcreated a sensation, and Edison was received as a veritable demigod.While Edison, who was accompanied by his new wife, Mina, just twenty-two yearsold, lunched with Alexandre Eiffel in his apartment at the top of the tower,Tesla met with Prof. Wilhelm Bjerknes at the fair to “witness the beautifuldemonstrations [of his] vibrating diaphragms.”5 A Norwegian physicist from theUniversity of Stockholm, Bjerknes had, along with Jules-Henri Poincaré, not onlyreplicated the work of Heinrich Hertz on the propagation of electromagneticwaves through space; they had also, according to Hertz, discovered multipleresonance and had worked out the mathematics of the phenomena.6 Tesla was ableto study Bjerknes’s oscillator, which provided a variety of electromagneticwaves and a resonator for augmenting them, and also discuss with him theoreticalimplications concerning the properties of the electromagnetic waves therebyproduced.And while the Wizard of Menlo Park met with Louis Pasteur at his laboratory inParis and received the French Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor for hisachievements, Tesla developed one of his most important discoveries, namely,that so-called Hertzian waves not only produced transverse oscillations,suggested by Bjerknes, but also longitudinal vibrations structured much likesound waves, “that is to say, waves, propagated by alternate compression andexpansion…of the ether.”7 This conceptualization would come to play a pivotalrole in the wireless transmitters Tesla would construct over the next decade.As Tesla packed his bags for a brief visit to see his family,8 Edison continuedon his tour. In Italy he was honored by Queen Marguerite of Venice and KingHumbert of Rome, in Berlin he met with Helmholtz at his laboratory, and atHeidelberg, Edison displayed his phonograph before a “monster meeting” offifteen thousand people at which the machine “delivered a speech in goodGerman.”9 Edison’s favorite moment, however, was when he attended a large dinnergiven by Buffalo Bill, who was touring Europe with his Wild West Show. And asTesla left for New York, Edison continued on to London, where he could visit hiscentral stations but also learn firsthand that the new use of the Tesla AC washere to stay.10 In Deptford, for instance, in this year, an engineer by the nameof Ferranti installed probably the first-ever working single-phase generatingstation; with a Tesla system, he was able to transmit 11,000 volts seven milesaway to London.11 Although a truly epoch making achievement, this plant, forsome unknown reason, received virtually no publicity.This was a complex time in the history of the electrical industry; thoseelectrical experts in Europe and America who took the time to study the Teslacreation saw its benefits immediately. In Switzerland and Germany polyphaseinduction motors were being constructed by C. E. L. Brown and Michael vonDolivo-Dobrowolsky, and in America Elihu Thomson of Thomson-Houston and WilliamStanley did the same. As in any branch of science, it was customary to study andreplicate the work of others, but in electrical engineering success ensured notonly a place in history but also a substantial profit. Thus, there would bemany, such as most of those mentioned above, who would try and claim thepolyphase system as their own.There was another motor invention, however, called the hydropneumatic pulsatingvacuo engine, which was on much safer ground; nobody could replicate theintricacies of its machinery, and nobody but the inventor, John Ernst WorrellKeely, knew how it worked. Keely had gotten the idea for the motor after readingthe treatise “Harmonies of Tones and Colours, Developed by Evolution,” byCharles Darwin’s niece Mrs. F. J. Hughes, which discussed the structure of theether and various theoretical harmonic laws of the universe.12 Hailed as avirtual perpetual-motion machine, the Keely motor never ceased to intoxicate thepublic, for Keely had the uncanny ability to keep the secret going, butcontinually achieve abstruse results. “In the opinion of Madame Blavatsky,[Keely] has discovered Vril, the mysterious force of the universe in which LordLytton drew attention in his ‘Coming Race’…Keely calls it sympathetic negativeattraction.”13Rivaling snake-oil salesmen in the ability to “humbug” the public, Keely, aformer “circus sleight-of-hand performer,” had formed a company in 1874,capitalized with $100,000 of stock in order to sell his motor, and had beensuccessfully doing so for nearly fifteen years, until 1889, when his work wasquestioned.Public Opinion wrote that, “Engineers, scientific men, and capitalists madefrequent pilgrimages to Keely’s Philadelphia laboratory to see the ‘Keely motormote.’ Sometimes it moted and sometimes it didn’t, but Keely always had a greattale to tell. Keely’s chief accomplishment was a ready use of jargon ofscientific and unscientific terms. He talked about ‘triune currents of polarflow of force,’ the ‘reflex action of gravity,’ ‘chords of mass,’ ‘sympatheticoutreaches of distance,’ ‘depolar etheric waves’ and a lot of other things whichdidn’t mean anything, but [he] never told why his motor moted and [why he] nevertook a patent” (although he did have them drawn up).14T. Carpenter Smith, writing in Engineering Magazine described an eyewitnessaccount with the “inventor” at work: “Mr. Keely proceeded to produce the forceby striking a large tuning-fork with a fiddle-bow and then touching thegenerator with the fork. After two or three attempts, which he said failed byreason of not getting the ‘chord of the mass,’ he turned a small valve on thetop of the generator. When a slight hiss was heard, loud cheers greeted hisannouncement that he had ‘got it.’…The state of mind of the audience may beimagined when the shout of one enthusiast ‘Keely, you are next to God Almighty!’seemed only a natural expression.”15This mountebank inventor headlined the New York dailies with his newestcreations and also the accompanying cry of fraud. Factions of the publicdemanded he be jailed, the court giving Keely sixty days to “divulge hissecret,”16 but Keely held fast. Threatening to stop work on his inventionsunless the court dropped its suit,17 Keely was held in contempt of court and inNovember of 1888, he was placed in jail.18Shortly thereafter, through his counsel, Keely revealed that the “missing link”was a “copper tube in the form of a hoop,” and he was released on bail a fewdays later. He argued that he had indeed “obeyed all orders of the court” inexplaining his invention in detail and the suit against him was overturned!19Like Edison, who promised and gave the world the “Lamp of Aladdin,” and Tesla,who discovered and harnessed a purported alternating current perpetual-motionmachine, Keely billed his own invention as the “greatest scientific discovery ofthe century.”Apparently vindicated, Keely proceeded with his deception. In 1890 the worldcelebrity and palmist Count Louis Hamon, better known as Cheiro, visited theKeely lab; and by 1895, John Jacob Astor became an investor.Unfortunately for Tesla, however, like Keely, he, too, was gaining a reputationfor making outlandish claims. For instance, Tesla said that his system could“place 100,000 horse-power on a wire” and send it hundreds of miles with almostno loss of power when the prevailing technology could only send a few hundredvolts one mile, and in that case, with power dropping off markedly withdistance.20 Never mind that this prognostication came true just a few yearslater; Tesla’s style was that of a visionary, and the claim seemed ridiculous.To the unimaginative, the uninformed, or people who listened only to theopposition, he was little different from Keely, and so he suffered through guiltby association.21As far back as 1884, Scientific American had published an exposé on the Keelymotor, speculating that its source of power was a secret chamber of compressedair. This was confirmed in 1898, after Keely’s death, in an investigation of hislaboratory conducted by Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore’s son Clarence. Having waited forhis mother, an ardent Keely admirer, to pass on before he tore the place apart,Moore discovered in the cellar a large tank and a series of pipes leading upthrough the floor above where the demonstrations took place. Keely’s “‘ethericforce’ was nothing more than compressed air [released by]…the pressure of hisfoot tapping on a concealed spring valve.”22Other bogus inventors of the day included Gaston Bulmar, who tried to sellGeneral Electric (GE) special pills that turned water into gasoline; WalterHonenau, who derived free energy from an H2O “hydro-atomizer” and “King Con,”Victor “the Count” Lustig, who was eventually arrested for devising and sellinga special money machine that cranked out crisp twenty-dollar bills from insertedwhite paper.23In an age of new marvels that almost daily transformed society in irreversibleways, the public was “ripe for picking”; naive investors were often bilked bypromises of impossible schemes. Thus, the inventor was perceived incontradictory ways, as executioner or light bearer, con man or wizard.When Tesla returned from Europe, he wanted nothing better than to have his ACinvention placed in the hands of its new rightful owner so that he could proceedwith other burgeoning interests. Naturally, he would continue to aidWestinghouse in any way that he could, by continually offering advice to Scott,Schmid, or Lamme or stopping by at Pittsburgh to provide hands-on expertise.Throughout the 1890s, whenever the opportunity presented itself, Tesla wouldalso introduce eminent prospective clients to the Westinghouse concern. As washis custom and style, Tesla never considered a commission for this service,although he did obtain vital equipment for his laboratory, which at first wasprovided without cost.And as with Keely, Bulwer-Lytton’s electrical-like energy called “vril power”had also been attached to Tesla by this time as well, via a letter from a ladyin 1890, who “dreamed that if I [Tesla] would read the ‘Coming Race’ of Bulwer,I would discover great things which would advance [my work considerably].” ButTesla would not pursue the mystical treatise for a decade, and therefore itappears that although the inventions discussed in the story bore greatsimilarities to some of Tesla’s later creations, the reader must not sayafterward that “the beautiful things which I shall invent were suggested byBulwer.”24 Nevertheless, the similarities remain, and one wonders whether or notTesla actually read the book at the time or knew of its contents."},{"pageContent":"8SOUTH FIFTH AVENUE (1890-91) [002-toc.html#ch8]> At one bound [Tesla] placed himself abreast such men as Edison, Brush, Elihu> Thomson, and Alexander Graham Bell…His performance touched on the marvelous.> > JOSEPH WETZLER IN HARPER’S WEEKLY, JULY 11, 18911Tesla returned from Paris during the summer of 1889 to his new laboratory nearBleecker Street. Down the road from one of Edison’s showrooms, the lab took upthe entire fourth floor of a six-story building located at 33-35 South FifthAvenue (which today is called West Broadway). At the same time, he toured thehotels, moving into the Astor House, a posh five-story establishment situated bya trolley line in the heart of the city.Over the summer, Tesla’s “best friend,” Anthony Szegeti, passed away. He wrotehome to notify his family. “I feel alienated,” he told Uncle Pajo, “and it isdifficult [for me to adapt to the American lifestyle].”2Now part of the nouveau riche, and also the star of the family, the inventorbegan sending money home to his mother and sisters and also to some of thecousins. Addressing the letters mostly to his sisters’ husbands, all of whomwere priests, Tesla wrote Uncle Pajo, “Somehow it is hard to correspond with theladies.”3 Although occasionally he did write his sisters, mostly he just sentchecks, and each of them would repeatedly write back to try and get a morepersonal word from “the only brother that we have.”4 Throughout the 1890s, Teslasent several thousand forints, at 150 forints a clip, which was an amountequivalent to six months’ rent at a well-to-do home or six months salary for aSerbian workman. Some of the funds were given as gifts, some to pay back hisuncles for their aid in funding his education and sojourn to the New World, andother funds, which were partially obtained through European royalties, were usedas investments.5 To Uncle Petar, who had advanced to become a Metropolitan(Cardinal) in Bosnia, Tesla revealed that he was receiving many letters fromdignitaries and also such respect that it was difficult for him to describe.6Uncle Pajo occasionally shipped European bottles of wine to his finicky nephew,unhappy with the selection in the United States. Impatiently waiting for thesebottles was, for Tesla, like “waiting for the messiah.”7As Tesla’s fame grew, and reports of his successes made the headlines in theirlocal papers, Tesla became a virtual demigod to the Serbian and Croatian people,and a noble, though distant benefactor to his family. “We think about you evenin [our] dreams,” one of his brothers-in-law wrote.8Except for occasional dinners with such friends as T. C. Martin or necessarytrips to Pittsburgh, the inventor spent virtually all of his waking existence atthe lab. His partner, Alfred S. Brown, would stop by to help when needed, butmostly Tesla worked with either one or two assistants or alone. As was hiscustom, he could labor seven days a week and around the clock, stopping only tofreshen up at the hotel or for a necessary appointment. Monastic by choice andcompelled by an all-consuming desire to be a major player in the burgeoning newage, the wizard preferred working through the night, when distractions could beminimized and concentration could be intensified.Now free, he began his investigations along a number of separate butinterrelated lines. As an experimental physicist, he began to study thedifference between electromagnetic and electrostatic phenomena, and also therelationship of the structure of the ether to that of electricity, matter, andlight. As an inventor, he began to design equipment for generating extremelyhigh frequencies and voltages and for transforming direct into alternatingcurrent, or vice versa, and for creating uniform oscillations. Tesla also wantedto devise ways to manufacture light and to explore the concept of wirelesscommunication. Already concerned about the fragility of the earth’s naturalresources, the finite supply of timber and coal, Tesla spent endless hours incontemplation, reviewing and replicating the findings of others, criticizing orimproving upon their inventions, and also designing completely originalcreations. His goal was influenced by an evolutionary perspective and pragmaticconsiderations: He wanted to devise mechanical means for doing away withneedless tasks of physical labor so that humans could spend more time increative endeavors.Unlike Karl Marx, who saw the worker becoming “an appendage of the machine,”9Tesla realized that machines could liberate the worker.The inventor, in Tesla’s eyes, had always been and always would be the lightgiver of the species, guiding its future through advanced technology. Themasses, in turn, would benefit because machines would perform menial tasks sothat they could pursue more intellectual occupations. With increased technology,cultural evolution would proceed at ever faster rates. “Conversely,” Teslawarned, “everything that is against the teachings of religion and law ofhygiene…tend[s] to decrease [human energy].”10 Impure drinking water, inparticular, was one of the greatest dangers.Within the next eighteen months Tesla initiated most of the inventions thatwould occupy him for the next half century. During the last weeks of 1889,Martin met with him on several occasions in order to finalize his article on theSerb’s heritage and plans for the future. The inventor would talk late into thenight about his youth and the incessant struggle of his ancestors to fight offthe diabolical Turks. As Martin took notes, Tesla outlined some of hisinventions, particularly his work with high frequencies and his originaltheories on the relationship between electromagnetism and the structure oflight. Martin tried to talk the inventor into presenting his ideas before theAIEE, but Tesla evaded a direct response. “Suppose I were to obtain for you LordKelvin’s lectures? I know they are a bit wearisome, and somewhat beyondsolution, but I believe that you, Samson like, can wrestle the honey from thislion’s jaw.”11“Perhaps” was Tesla’s reply.On January 21, 1890, Professor Anthony took over the presidency of the AIEE fromElihu Thomson (who followed T. C. Martin) and opened the year with his ownlecture on new electrical theories.12 Happy to see the professor again, Teslaattended the seminar and was elected vice president. Participating in thediscussion which followed, he was joined by Irish mathematician Arthur Kennellyof the Edison Company and Michael Pupin, a physics teacher and fellow Serb.Having just returned from Helmholtz’s laboratory in Germany, Pupin was unawareof the extent of the animosity that existed between the Edison and Westinghousecamps.Pupin was from Idvor, a Serbian town north of Belgrade. His father had been aknez, or village leader, much like Tesla’s father, but unlike Milutin Tesla, Mr.Pupin was an illiterate peasant and not part of the clerical aristocracy. Manyof Pupin’s relatives, like Tesla’s, were war heroes who had fought off the Turksto protect the empire; and, like Tesla, Pupin had avoided military service.Michael Pupin emigrated to the United States in 1874. After working at odd jobs,he entered Columbia College in New York in 1878. Graduating in 1884 with a keeninterest in electrical theory and with honors, Pupin received a fellowship tostudy abroad. He wanted to go to Cambridge to learn under James Clerk Maxwell,but he found upon his arrival that Maxwell had been dead for four years.13 Thistendency to overlook the obvious appears to be a theme that runs through Pupin’slife. After Cambridge, he went on to the University of Berlin, where he receiveda doctorate in physics. In 1889 he returned to New York to become an instructorat Columbia College.In February 1890, the full-page Martin article on Tesla was published inElectrical World accompanied by a very prominent photograph of theyouthful-looking engineer. For Tesla it was excellent publicity, the first majoressay to appear portraying the up-and-coming inventor.A meeting of the AIEE, devoted entirely to the new Tesla AC system, was plannedfor the following month. In particular, the conference had been sparked by anumber of important developments; most notably plans coming from Switzerland andGermany for a proposed long-distance AC power-transmission experiment,14 theimpending success of the Westinghouse Company in instituting a hydroelectricplant utilizing the Tesla AC system at a mining camp in Telluride, Colorado, andthe announcement of an International Niagara Commission to look into the bestway to harness Niagara Falls.At the March AIEE meeting, Prof. Louis Duncan was the main speaker; his lecturebegan with a mathematical dissection of the workings of “the novel and admirablelittle machine invented by Mr. Tesla.” A former officer from the U.S. NavalAcademy, Duncan had recently transferred from the South Pacific to Johns HopkinsUniversity, where he stayed on to teach. An important ally, he gave the Teslainvention academic credibility. “The great advantage of the motor,” Duncan said,“lies in the fact that it has no commutator and it permits the use of very highvoltages. In the future, power will be transmitted electrically at voltages thatwill make machines with the commutator next to useless.” After the lecture,there was a discussion, and Tesla participated.15Pupin, who spoke that summer in Boston and again in New York the following yearon “Alternating Current Theory,” was fast becoming an admirer of Tesla’s work.However, at the same time, Pupin was also becoming embroiled in the controversyas to who was the real author of the AC polyphase system, and from Tesla’svantage point, Pupin made the mistake of befriending the wrong people.At the Boston meeting, Pupin “noticed that my audience was divided into twodistinct groups; one group was cordial and appreciative, but the other was ascold as ice. The famous electrical engineer and inventor, Elihu Thomson, was inthe friendly group, and he looked me up after the address and congratulated mecordially. That was a great encouragement and I felt happy.” Other prominentindividuals, however, tried to have Pupin fired from the electrical engineeringdepartment at Columbia because of his adherence to AC,16 but Pupin overrode thecontroversy and at the same time increased his friendship with Thomson.Unbeknown to Pupin, Thomson himself was in a quandary because he now recognizedthe clear advantage of the Tesla system, but he was locked out of its usebecause Westinghouse owned the patents.Although the Thomson-Houston Electric Company was extremely profitable, theconcern faced certain doom if it was unable to use efficient AC machinery. AsElihu Thomson had worked with AC for over a decade, he felt fully justified inadapting a Tesla-like system, especially because there were other engineers whoalso claimed legitimate priorities of aspects of the system, notablyShallenberger and Ferraris. Furthermore, Thomson himself had come close toconceiving a similar workable plan. That Tesla held fundamental patents on acompletely revolutionary invention was continually overlooked by Thomson as hesought ways to rationalize his position while working at his company, presidingat the AIEE, and writing in the electrical journals. He had successfullycircumvented the Edison lightbulb patents by paying Sawyer for a license toproduce the stopper lamp, (an exhausted light bulb similar to Edison’s whichused a rubber plug—stopper—to hold in the vacuum) and so he sought a similartack with AC.During a heated series of articles in Electrical World between Thomson andTesla, it appears that Thomson admits to some of his distaste for his rival whenhe writes, “I confess that my statement as to the motive of my critical remarksmay have been out of place. They were elicited, however, by Mr. Tesla having ona former occasion misunderstood my motives.”17 And so Pupin’s feelings for hisSerbian brother became undermined as his friendship with Thomson grew.Tesla agreed to present his work in high-frequency phenomena during a three-daysymposium of the AIEE, which was held in May 1891, three months after he firstpublished his research on the topic.18 A hall was booked at Columbia College,which, at the time, was located between Park and Madison avenues, on Forty-ninthand Fiftieth Streets, and the public was invited.19It is difficult to calculate the enormous impact that this lecture had on theengineers of the day and on the course of Tesla’s life, for it is clear thatafter the event Tesla was perceived in an extraordinary way. Joseph Wetzler, orJosh, as he preferred to be called, covered the talk for Electrical World. ButTesla’s lecture was too important for a single exposure in a journal of limitedcirculation, and Wetzler was able to also peddle the piece as a spectacularfull-page account in the prestigious Harper’s Weekly.“[With] lucid explanations in pure nervous English,” Wetzler proclaimed, “thisstripling from the dim border-land of Austro-Hungary…[had] not only gone farbeyond the two distinguished European scientists Dr. Lodge and Professor Hertzin grasp of electro-magnetic theory of light, but…he had actually made apparatusby which electrostatic waves or ‘thrusts’ would give light for ordinaryevery-day uses.” Tesla had not only presented a remarkable display of electricalphantasmagoria, he had also outlined new “fundamental and far reachingprinciples.”20Wetzler cogently pointed out that Tesla had gone far beyond Heinrich Geisslerand Sir William Crookes in the production of light by use of vacuum tubes, andhe had also “eclipsed” the Wizard of Menlo Park with his refinements of theincandescent lamp. “But Mr. Tesla was not satisfied with these results,brilliant as they were. He had set himself no less a task than to create a lampwhich, without any external connection to wires…would glow brightly when placedanywhere in an apartment.”21 And if that were not enough, for a conclusion,Tesla passed tens of thousands of volts of AC through his body to light uplightbulbs and shoot sparks off his fingertips and to show the world that it wasnot at all a killer current when utilized correctly. “Exhausted tubes…held inthe hand of Mr. Tesla…appeared like a luminous sword in the hand of an archangelrepresenting justice,” said one reporter.22With Gano Dunn, his assistant,23 Tesla began his talk somewhat nervously butgained momentum as he progressed: “Of all the forms of nature’s immeasurable,all-pervading energy, which ever and ever change and move, like a soul animatesan innate universe, electricity and magnetism are perhaps the mostfascinating…We know,” Tesla continued, “that [electricity] acts like anincompressible fluid; that there must be a constant quantity of it in nature;that it can neither be produced or destroyed…and that electric and etherphenomena are identical.” Having set up the premise that our world is immersedin a great sea of electricity, the wizard proceeded to astound the audience withhis myriad experiments. And at the end, Tesla’s matched his opening in poeticexpression: “We are whirling through endless space, with an inconceivablespeed,” he said. “All around us everything is spinning, everything is moving,everywhere is energy.” Based on this premise, Tesla ended with a propheticsupposition, which has often been interpreted by some to suggest that a zeropoint, or free energy strata, exists. “There must be some way of availingourselves of this energy directly,” he said. “Then, with the light obtainedthrough the medium, with the power derived from it, with every form of energyobtained without effort, from stores forever inexhaustible, humanity willadvance with giant strides. The mere contemplation of these magnificentpossibilities expands our minds, strengthens our hopes and fills our hearts withsupreme delight.”24Those who attended the lecture, including Professor Anthony, Alfred S. Brown,Elmer Sperry,25 William Stanley, Elihu Thomson, and Francis Upton, wouldremember the historic occasion for the rest of their lives.26 Robert Millikan,for instance, who later won a Nobel Prize for his work with cosmic rays, was agraduate student at Columbia at the time. He said many years later, “I have doneno small fraction of my research work with the aid of the principles I learnedthat night.”27Michael Pupin, who also attended, however, appears not to have been soentranced. “[While] I was lecturing,” Tesla told a Serbian reporter, “Mr. Pupin,with his friends, [most likely, Elihu Thomson and Carl Hering] interrupted…bywhistling, and I had difficulty quieting down the misled audience.”28 Pupinwrote to Tesla to smooth things over and to set up an appointment to see themotor, as he was scheduled to deliver a number of lectures on polyphasecurrents, but Tesla avoided him.29 In Europe rumors began to circulate about thenew electrical Svengali in America, and Tesla was quickly invited to speakbefore European scientific societies."},{"pageContent":"9REVISING THE PAST (1891) [002-toc.html#ch9]> Many of the investigations of the book apply to polyphase systems circuits> [with chapters] on induction motors, generators, synchronous motors, [etc.]…A> part of this book is original, other parts have been published before by other> investigators…I have, however, omitted altogether literary references, for the> reason that incomplete references would be worse than some, while complete> references would entail expenditure of much more time than is at my disposal…I> believe that the reader…is more interested in the information than in knowing> who first investigated the phenomenon.> > CHARLES STEINMETZ1Three months after Tesla’s Columbia College lecture, in August 1891, twoengineers, Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown, of the Swiss firm of MaschinenfabrikOerlikon, and Michael von Dolivo-Dobrowolsky, representing the German firmAllgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG), galvanized the engineeringcommunity when they successfully transmitted 190 horsepower from a waterfall ata cement factory on the Neckar River in Lauffen to the International ElectricalExposition, which was being held at Frankfurt, Germany, 112 miles away. With thesupport of three different governments, the lines passed through Wurtemberg,Bavaria, and Prussia before arriving in Frankfurt.2By using oil as an insulator, as Tesla had explained in his Columbia Collegelecture, Brown was able to generate as much as 40,000 volts on his equipment,25,000 of which he transported along the wires, stepping them down to usablefrequencies when they reached the exposition. The efficiency of 74.5 percentastounded his colleagues. Dobrowolsky, who suggested that the invention was hisconceptualization, utilized a three-phase AC with a working frequency of 40cycles per second (instead of the single-phase current, with a frequency of 133cycles per second, that the Westinghouse people kept insisting on). The powerwas so great at the Frankfurt site that a large advertising sign with a thousandincandescent lamps was lit, and a motor pump powering an artificial waterfallwas harnessed.3On December 16, Michael Pupin delivered a talk before the AIEE on polyphasesystems. Having given the same talk a week before at the New York MathematicalSociety, Pupin was proud to advance abstract theories on this new field ofpolyphase systems. With his hair swept back, wearing wire-rimmed glasses, abrush mustache tapered at the ends, and a professorial three-piece suit, Pupinwas fast readjusting to his return to the States. Now he was beginning to carvea name for himself. Dutifully, he had written Tesla before the talk to discusshis motors, but the inventor had eluded him.In his opening remarks at the AIEE, with Arthur Kennelly, Elihu Thomson, CharlesBradley, and Charles Steinmetz present, Pupin referred to the “beautifulinventions of Nikola Tesla and the completeness of the success which Dobrowolskyand Brown obtained by the practical applications of these inventions,” but healso described the German operation in such a way as to imply that aspects of itwere independently conceived.It appears that Tesla did not attend the lecture. Instead, he wrote Pupin theday after; but it was not to offer congratulations or to extend an invitation tomeet. Tesla suggested that Pupin obtain the original patent specifications; theGerman design was simply a copy of his work.But Pupin shot back, “I don’t think that you ought to find fault with me for nothaving given your inventions a fuller discussion…In the first place, it was alittle bit too soon to discuss the practical details…in a paper which treats ofthe most general fundamental principles of the polyphasal systems. Secondly, Iknow of your motors only by hearsay; I have not had the pleasure of being shownone by anybody…I looked you up twice at your hotel and wrote you once…but all myefforts were in vain.”4 Pupin tried at the end of the letter to set up apersonal interview, but Tesla was not one who could easily forgive such naïveté,especially from a Serb who spoke the native tongue so poorly.5 To thehypersensitive Tesla, Pupin was a man who spread falsehoods. And his continualassociation with Thomson did not help. As Tesla was about to take a trip toEurope, a meeting of amelioration never took place.Concerning the dispute over whose invention it really was, it is important torealize that obfuscation of the truth continues to this day.6 The problem beganwith Michael von Dolivo-Dobrowolsky himself, who was reluctant to admit that hegot the idea from Tesla, and it was perpetuated by his friend Carl Hering, whowrote a prodigious number of articles on the episode in the journals as theevent unfolded throughout 1891. Hering had been a professor of engineering atthe university in Darmstadt, Germany, in the early 1880s. His protégéDobrowolsky, a native of St. Petersburg and the son of a Russian nobleman,replaced Hering when he retired from the university at the end of 1883.C. E. L. Brown, a Swiss native and son of a designer of steam engines, begansuccessfully transmitting electrical power with AC dynamos he had constructedwhile working in Lucerne. Brown, who was a year younger than Dobrowolsky andseven years younger than Tesla, had received most of his training in Winterthurand Basel, where he worked for the Burgin machine shops. In 1884 he began hisemployment at Oerlikon and within two years became director of operations.7 OnFebruary 9, 1891, Brown delivered an address in Frankfurt on the subject oflong-distance transmisssion of electrical power, and that is where he metDobrowolsky. A partnership was formed between Oerlikon and AEG, and within sevenmonths, their success between Lauffen and Frankfurt was achieved.8Now, with Dobrowolsky’s claims and Hering’s one-sided reporting in theelectrical journals,9 factions of the American engineering community that werelocked out of the Tesla patents could extol the Lauffen-Frankfurt venture whileat the same time continuing to imply that Tesla’s work was not intrinsic to itssuccess. Ironically, the Westinghouse side wanted to downplay the event as well,not only because it proved Tesla right and them wrong but also because itdwarfed their success at Telluride. Thus, when perusing the Westinghouseliterature, one is hard-pressed to find any mention of Lauffen-Frankfurt at all.Pupin, in his lectures, did not support Tesla’s role, nor did Kennelly, Thomson,or Bradley. Charles Proteus Steinmetz, however, was in another category. LikePupin, he had just emigrated from Europe, and also like Pupin, he wasacademically oriented, with no particular economic stake in the invention atthat time.Steinmetz, who had fled Germany in 1889 in order to escape imprisonment forbeing a revolutionary socialist, was a brilliant student of mathematics from theUniversity of Breslau. A dwarf hunchback, with his head sunk into his shouldersand one leg shorter than the other, Steinmetz had to continually overcome hisodd appearance and frail disposition by displaying an advanced intellect. Justtwenty-six years old and still attempting to cultivate a mustache and beard,Steinmetz, who was gaining a reputation for his work on the law of hysteresis(which involved a mathematical explanation that explained the lagging ofmagnetic effects when electromagnetic forces are changed) recognized some flawsin Pupin’s talk. As this would be one of his earliest attempts to expresshimself before his peers in the difficult English language,10 he carefullybolstered the addendum by bringing along calculations and drawings. Working inYonkers, Steinmetz had developed a single-phase commutator motor a year before,in the summer of 1890.11With brazenly long shoulder-length hair, the gnome was dressed in a slightlywrinkled three-piece suit adorned with an opulent watch chain and a pair ofpince-nez that hung distinctively from a strap attached to his right collar.Standing to his full height of four feet and reaching for his glasses to readoff his calculations, Steinmetz noted in his German accent that “Ferraris builtonly a little toy.” He also went on to correct Pupin’s implication that theDobrowolsky creation was the first to use a three-phase system. “I cannot agreewith that in the least, for [that] already [exists] in the old Tesla motor.”Summing up, Steinmetz concluded, “I really cannot see anything new…in thenew…Dobrowolsky system.”12It would take a few months for Steinmetz to realize why his colleagues raisedtheir eyebrows as he dashed all hopes for Dobrowolsky’s claims. Nevertheless,they were impressed with his analysis and mathematical expertise. Elihu Thomsonreturned to his firm of Thomson-Houston in Lynn, Massachusetts, with theknowledge that a new mathematical genius had arrived from Europe, and soonthereafter Thomson-Houston offered Steinmetz a job at Lynn.Meanwhile, in Pittsburgh, unbeknown to Edison, Westinghouse had beensurreptitiously meeting with Henry Villard, Edison’s financial backer, over atwo-year period to discuss a possible merger. Villard, who had recently combineda number of smaller companies with Edison Electric to create Edison GeneralElectric, was well aware that Edison did not get along with Westinghouse.Villard was an immigrant from Germany, the son of a Bavarian judge. Having triedin his earlier days to set up a “free soil” German settlement in Kansas, Villardwas the individual who drove the golden spike in the Northern Pacific Railroadto link the West Coast with the East. He conferred with J. Pierpont Morgan, thereal power behind the operation, and had Morgan send Edward Dean Adams, alongtime banking associate, to Menlo Park to try and get Edison to align withWestinghouse. Thriving on “beating the other guy,” Edison would hear none of it.“Westinghouse,” he said, “has gone crazy over sudden accession of wealth orsomething unknown to me and is flying a kite that will land him in the mudsooner or later.”13Legal fees in trying to protect the Edison lightbulb patents had already costEdison $2 million and Westinghouse the same. The Edison camp had decided to sueWestinghouse rather than Thomson-Houston, because the Pittsburgh company hadpurchased United States Electric, the concern that held the competing patentsfrom Sawyer-Man and Hiram Maxim, while Thomson-Houston had only a leaseagreement. Thus, while two giants fought each other in what Edison called “asuicide of time,” Thomson-Houston got rich.On July 14, 1891, after many years of battles and appeals on priority ofinvention of the lightbulb, Judge Bradley ruled in favor of Edison. AlthoughWestinghouse was caught with the wrong lightbulb patents, his Tesla AC powersystem was an asset worth attaining; but Westinghouse was proving difficult tonegotiate with. Villard therefore began to make overtures to Tesla directly, butthe inventor had to yield to Westinghouse’s decisions.“Dear Sir,” Tesla wrote Villard in his tidiest penmanship, “I have approachedMr. Westinghouse in a number of ways and endeavored to get to anunderstanding…[but] the results have not been very promising…Realizing this, andalso considering carefully the chances and probabilities of success, I haveconcluded that I cannot associate myself with the undertaking you contemplate.”Tesla reluctantly concluded the letter by wishing the financier “best success in[his] pioneer enterprise.”14Villard switched tactics and approached Thomson-Houston with the thought ofbuying them out. He had gone up to Lynn, Massachusetts, in February and hadcontinued secret negotiations with Charles Coffin, chief executive officer (CEO)of Thomson-Houston, throughout the summer. In December a meeting was held at 23Wall Street, in Morgan’s office, to finalize plans for a merger. After Morganlooked over the financial records of both companies, he realized that EdisonElectric, which was in debt for $3.5 million, had less revenue than the smallerand solvent Thomson-Houston. Morgan thereupon reversed himself and suggestedthat Thomson-Houston buy out Edison Electric. Either way, he created a monopoly.Simultaneously, Morgan maneuvered Villard out of the company altogether—he hadto blame someone for the problems—and Charles Coffin took control of the newconsolidation. They named the company General Electric (GE).Because of the enormous debt of his company and the possibility that he wasworking with inferior DC equipment, Edison had lost his edge. The thought ofworking with that patent pirate Elihu Thomson and the removal of his own namefrom the marquee made the electrical wizard, for the time, a beaten man.Although he stirred the hornets’ nest before he left, Edison realized that a newage of electricity had arrived, one that would not countenance his commonsense,trial-and-error approach. Over a year before the actual merger was completed, hewrote Villard, “It is clear that my usefulness is gone…Viewing it from thislight you will see how impossible it is for me to spur my mind, under the shadowof possible future affiliations…I would now ask you not to oppose my gradualretirement from the lighting business, which will enable me to enter into freshand congenial fields of work.”15 And so Edison turned his interests tofurthering the work of Edward Muybridge, a pioneer in motion pictures. In 1888and 1891 he had his first patents on a device he called the kinetograph, and afew years later, he developed a fully working movie camera and projectionsystem. In 1893, Edison could write to the elderly Muybridge16 that he now had apeep-show device that people would pay five cents to see.17The “Morganization” of GE created an even greater foe for Westinghouse but alsoa critical problem for GE. Whereas Westinghouse was blocked from using anefficient lightbulb, GE was blocked from generating AC. As the Edison patentswere only valid for another two years, certainly Westinghouse was in the betterposition. But in 1891-92 it was still too early in the game to realize this.From the point of view of the courts, it was still undecided as to who theauthor of the AC polyphase system really was, even though Westinghouse had theFerraris patent trump card to back those of Tesla’s, and so, over the next fewyears, Westinghouse was forced to sue not only a number of subsidiaries of GEbut also some independents, such as William Stanley, who were now producingpolyphase systems on their own.From GE’s point of view, there was a whole host of patents in AC that Thomsonowned, but any others that they could obtain would undoubtedly help in the legalarena. Thus, they approached Charles Steinmetz with a scheme to work onimprovements on AC designs in such a way that they would obscure Tesla’s role.Attracted to the intrigue, Steinmetz accepted the challenge.18The fray between Westinghouse and GE took a new turn in the race to win the bidto light the upcoming Chicago World’s Fair and to harness Niagara Falls. In thecourts, the suits switched from lightbulbs to power generation, and at theirrespective plants attention turned toward a way to compete with the successachieved by Brown and Dobrowolsky.For Westinghouse Corporation, Schmid, Scott, and Lamme could confer with Tesla,while Stillwell and Shallenberger brooded, and the money men reluctantly agreedto dismantle the very lucrative but outmoded Gaulard-Gibbs machinery. For GE,the situation was more complex. They had hoped that someone like Steinmetz orThomson could come up with a competing design, but they hadn’t realized thatTesla held all the fundamental patents. Quite simply, there was no other system.Tesla had understood the foundation. One couldn’t proceed without him.Thomson and Steinmetz were reduced to figuring out ways to somehow bypass thepatents by designing “teaser currents”19 or some other smokescreen device inorder to pretend that they had created a separate invention. In a case ofindustrial espionage, Thomson-Houston apparently paid a janitor to steal theTesla blueprints from the Westinghouse plant.20 Embarrassed to explain how theblueprints ended up at Lynn, Thomson said that he needed to study the Teslamotor designs to make sure that his were different.The intrigue must have triggered a variety of emotions in Steinmetz. He hadalready lived a clandestine life in Germany; by editing a radical socialistnewspaper under a pseudonym during the so-called Reign of Terror, he had learnedto use secret passwords at radical meetings and write with invisible ink, aswhen he carried love notes between his leader, the charismatic revoutionaryHeinrich Lux, who had been jailed for his activities, and Lux’s girlfriend.Although Steinmetz never renounced his affiliation with the socialist movement,he supported a rather unscrupulous capitalistic corporate structure that wasmotivated not only by the all-consuming profit motive but also by its ability tosubvert the law to achieve its ends. This new situation thereby only served toheighten his contradictory nature.His affiliation with the Machiavellian policies of GE induced Steinmetz toabandon his ideals. His opus on AC, Theory and Calculations of AlternatingCurrent Phenomena, coauthored with Ernst Julius Berg, a colleague educated atthe Royal Polytechnikum in Stockholm, and first published in 1897, just threeyears after Tesla’s own compendium, omitted any reference to Tesla at all. (Bythe turn of the century, Berg’s name on the cover, like Lux’s love notes,disappeared.)At the time, Tesla’s book The Inventions, Researches and Writings of NikolaTesla, edited by T. C. Martin, was a veritable bible for all engineers in thefield. It included chapters on alternating-current motors, the rotating magneticfield, synchronizing motors, rotating field transformers, polyphase systems,single-phase motors, etc. That it does not appear in the bibliography ofSteinmetz’s work is astounding.In the foreword to Steinmetz’s second text, Theoretical Elements of ElectricalEngineering, written in 1902, the author tries to explain why he omittedreference to the inventor of the AC polyphase system. “Of later years,”Steinmetz wrote, “the electrical literature has been haunted by so manytheories, for instance of the induction motor, which are incorrect.”21 This wasa natural opening that might have catapulted Steinmetz into a discussion whichwould set the record straight, but he chose a pusillanimous path instead. Thisdecision not only aided in obfuscating the truth as to the origin of theinvention; it also bolstered his own image in the corporate community.As these texts on AC would serve as important templates for subsequent writers,it was quite common in the later years for engineers to obtain degrees, studyAC, and even write textbooks on the topic themselves and never come acrossTesla’s name.Clearly, it was to GE’s benefit to pretend that Tesla never existed, and it wasto Westinghouse’s benefit to pretend that the Lauffen-Frankfurt transmission hadnever occurred. The next generation of engineers, and those that followed, neverrealized that obfuscation had taken place; that is one of the main reasons whyTesla’s name practically vanished.Perhaps the most blatant case of misrepresentation occurred a generation later,when Michael Pupin published his Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography FromImmigrant to Inventor. Pupin was able to write long passages on the history ofAC and ignore Tesla almost completely. Tesla’s name appears only once, inpassing, in the 396-page book.22In this work Pupin described “four historical events, very important in theannals of electrical science,” that is, the Lauffen-Frankfurt transmission, theharnessing of Niagara Falls, the formation of GE, and the lighting of theChicago World’s Fair by AC. Mentioning the Westinghouse concern only once as acompany that was interested in AC, Pupin concluded, “If the Thomson-HoustonCompany had contributed nothing else than Elihu Thomson to…[GE], it would havecontributed more than enough…[Thus] the senseless opposition to the alternatingcurrent system…vanished quickly.23In the preface Pupin had the audacity to write that “the main object of [my]narrative [is]…to describe the rise of idealism in American science, andparticularly in physical sciences and the related industries…[As] witness tothis gradual development,…[this] testimony has competence and weight.”Considering that Pupin is generally remembered fondly by the engineering world,it is my opinion that he failed to live up to the standards to which he aspired.These attempts to alter the past turned the stomach of a number of key players,most notably C. E. L. Brown, of Oerlikon Works in Switzerland, and one of histop engineers, B. A. Behrend. A staunch man with a granite profile and hound-dogeyes, Brown, who, with Dobrowolsky, had been the first engineer to transmitelectrical power over long distances with Tesla’s AC invention, had learned ofTesla’s work from British engineer Gisbert Kapp, who published Tesla’s 1888 talkin his magazine Industries. Kapp, who authored one of the most “brilliant”textbooks on induction motors, wrote Tesla on June 9, 1888, to request the useof his paper for the magazine.24Based on Tesla’s treatise and Kapp’s refinements, Brown was able to construct“[before] Westinghouse…probably…the first successful motor…in 1890.”25 Brown’ssuccinct response, conspicuously placed in Electrical World, was directedspecifically to Carl Hering, one of the first writers to imply that theinvention was Dobrowolsky’s. “The three-phase current as applied at Frankfort,”Brown wrote, “is due to the labors of Mr. Tesla, and will be found clearlyspecified in his patents.”26Hering’s first response was to continue the artifice. “I do not think,” Heringsaid, “[that] Mr. Brown does proper justice to the real inventor of thismodification of the Ferraris-Tesla system, namely, Dobrowolsky.”27 But Teslademanded a more clear-cut communiqué. After a discussion with W. J. Johnston,who would later allow Hering to take over the editorship of Electrical World,Tesla was able to obtain the following response: “We desire to state righthere,” Johnston said, “that the Electrical World has over and over put itself onrecord as upholding Mr. Tesla’s priority.”28 The magazine was also able toextract from Hering the following: “Dobrowolsky, though he may have been anindependent inventor, admits that Tesla’s work is prior to his.”29Although Hering was loath to admit Tesla’s priority, at the same time he placedhis finger on an important point: Tesla himself had not demonstrated physicallythat his system could be used for long-distance transmission. CertainlyWestinghouse at that time was not aware of the vast benefits of the system. Hadit not been for the success at Lauffen-Frankfurt, Tesla’s apparatus might haveevolved differently in America. Hering did not have access to various details ofthe Westinghouse motors, and that was because the work was not in the publicdomain. Great amounts of money were spent to keep the work private. Had aLauffen-Frankfurt type of transmission occurred in America withoutWestinghouse’s permission, it would have clearly been a case of patent piracy.Tesla issued patents in most of the industrialized countries, and it appearslikely that Brown and Oerlikon licensed Tesla’s patents and paid him for theprivilege of using them.Coincidentally, Gisbert Kapp’s treatise, which was initially published in twoinstallments in December 1890 in the Electrician in London, appears also to havebeen used extensively by Charles Steinmetz in 1891 and 1892, while he wasconstructing AC motors at a machine shop in New York before he was hired byThomson, according to B. A. Behrend, author of one of the first definitive workson the AC motor. An émigré from Switzerland, Behrend came to work for the NewEngland Granite Company, a division of GE, in 1896. Particularly upset by thetactics of such writers as Steinmetz in using other people’s work and leavingtheir names out of the bibliography, Behrend would later become one of Tesla’smost important allies. In the foreword of his book, Behrend stated: “Thetendency to write books without references is due largely to the desire to avoidthe looking-up of other writers’ papers. The reader is not benefited by suchtreatment, as he may frequently prefer the original to the treatment of theauthor whose book he is reading. Besides, a knowledge of the literature of ourprofession is essential to an understanding of the art and to an honestinterpretation of the part played therein by our fellow workers.”30Writing to Oliver Heaviside specifically about such authors as Steinmetz,Behrend quoted Huxley: “Magna est veritas et praevalebit!” translating andmodifying the quote as follows, “Truth is great, certainly, but considering hergreatness, it is curious what a long time she is apt to take about prevailing.”The body of his book began with this sentence: “The Induction Motor, or RotaryField Motor, was invented by Mr. Nikola Tesla, in 1888.” Tesla’s picture alsoappeared as the frontispiece.Throughout his life, Behrend sought to set the record straight as to who thereal author of the AC polyphase system was. When Westinghouse sued New EnglandGranite for patent infringements, Behrend was placed in “an embarrassing anddisagreeable” position; the high command, which stemmed from Wall Street, wantedhim to testify against Tesla.On May 3, 1901, Behrend wrote back to the attorney Arthur Stem, “My dear sir…Youwill see that I am now, even more than I have been before, of the opinion thatit is not possible for us to bring forth arguments that could go to show theinvalidity of the Tesla Patents in suit…I cannot undertake this duty.”31"},{"pageContent":"10THE ROYAL SOCIETY (1892) [002-toc.html#ch10]> The lecture given by Mr. Tesla…will live long in the imagination of every> person…that heard him, opening as it did, to many of them, for the first time,> apparently limitless possibilities in the applications and control of> electricity.

Summoning hisprodigious powers of self-denial, depriving himself of sleep, and exerting thefull potential of his will, Tesla unfurled his creations as fast as he could. Itwas at this time that the grand vision arose of wireless transmission ofelectrical power, and he simply abhorred the thought that someone else shouldinvent it before he could. Thus, he began to build ever more powerful coilswhile at the same time continuing his numerous experiments in high-intensitylighting, ozone production, converting AC to DC, and wireless communication.In February 1891, Tesla applied for the first of three portentous patents forthe conversion and distribution of electrical energy.2 This invention, which wasfinalized after his return from Europe, was the mechanical oscillator, acompletely unique, multipurpose device. Unlike the Hertz spark-gap apparatus,which produced slow, rhythmic discharges, the Tesla oscillator supplied asmooth, continuous current which could not only generate hundreds of thousands,or even millions, of volts but could also be tuned to specific frequencies. Overhis lifetime, Tesla said, “I developed not less than fifty types of thesetransformers…each complete in every detail.”3The device was, in essence, a small engine, with almost no moving parts. The“work-performing piston was not connected with anything else but was perfectlyfree to vibrate at an enormous rate. In this machine,” Tesla proclaimed, “Isucceeded in doing away with all packings, valves and lubrication [although theutilization of oil was intrinsic to its design.]…By combining this engine with adynamo…I produced a highly efficient generator…[which propagated] an unvaryingrate of oscillation.”4 Since the current was so “absolutely steady anduniform…one could keep the time of day with the machine.”5 In fact, the inventoralso used the oscillator as a clock.In June 1891, Tesla came upon an article by Prof. J. J. Thomson. This Britishscientist, whose work would lead him to a Nobel Prize as the discoverer of theelectron, was in the process of directing electrical beams from cathode-raytubes so as to study the structure of electromagnetic energy. Theseinvestigations prompted a vigorous exchange in the electrical journals betweenthese two men6 and inspired Tesla to “return with renewed zeal to my ownexperiments. Soon my efforts were centered upon producing in a small space themost intense inductive action.”7 Tesla would describe these exciting results toThomson in person, six months later, during the lectures he gave in London.That same year, Tesla took out two more patents on AC motors which he owedWestinghouse; he also took out a patent on an electrical meter and a condenser,and two on incandescent lighting.On January 8, 1892, T. C. Martin, Josh Wetzler, and George Sheep sent Tesla aninvitation “to dine, and spend an evening…before your journey to Europe.”8Tesla’s glass blower, David Hiergesell, provided all of the tubes necessary forthe trip. Sailing on the sixteenth, Tesla arrived in London on the twenty-sixth.Sir William Preece provided a horse and carriage for the young inventor andinvited Tesla to stay at his house.9 Tesla’s plan was to speak before theInstitution of Electrical Engineers a week later “and leave immediately forParis” to lecture before the Société Française des Electriciens.It must have been gratifying that Preece took an interest, as he was part of theold guard. Twenty-two years Tesla’s senior and one of the patriarchs of theBritish scientific community, Preece was an amiable gentleman, with a full richbeard, high forehead, wire-rimmed glasses, and an air of self-assurance. As headof the government’s Postal Telegraph Office, Preece had worked with telegraphyas far back as 1860 and had brought Bell’s telephone, along with Bell himself,to the British Isles in the mid-1870s. He had also been associated with Edisonsince 1877, having coined the term “Edison effect” after visiting the wizard in1884 to study his work with vacuum lamps and a peculiar “effect” wherebyelectronic particles flowed through space from the negative pole to thepositive. Using this device as a voltage regulator Preece returned to England toshow his colleagues, especialy Ambrose Fleming.10After a few days of enjoyable company and a tour of London, Tesla relaxed, andon Wednesday, February 3, his discourse, entitled Experiments with AlternateCurrents of High Potential and High Frequency, was presented.“For a full two hours, Mr. Tesla kept his audience spellbound. Before suchcolleagues as J. J. Thomson, Oliver Heaviside, Silvanus P. Thompson, JosephSwan, Sir John Ambrose Fleming, Sir James Dewar, Sir William Preece, Sir OliverLodge, Sir William Crookes, and Lord Kelvin, Tesla proclaimed the driving forceof his motivation: ‘Is there, I ask, can there be, a more interesting study thanthat of alternating current?’…We observe how th[is] energy…tak[es] the manyforms of heat, light, mechanical energy, and…even chemical affinity…All of theseobservations fascinate us…Each day we go to our work…in the hope that someone,no matter who, may find a solution [to] one of the pending problems,—and eachsucceeding day we return to our task with renewed ardor; and even if we areunsuccessful, our work has not been in vain, for in these strivings…we havefound hours of untold pleasure, and we have directed our energies to the benefitof mankind.”11“Any feature of merit which this work may contain,” Tesla humbly stated, “wasderived from the work of a number of scientists who are present today, not a fewwho can lay better claim than myself.” Looking about the room and, with a gleamin his eye, Tesla continued.12 “One at least I must mention…It is a nameassociated with the most beautiful invention ever made: it is Crookes!…I believethat the origin [of my advances]…was that fascinating little book [on radiantenergy] which I read many years ago.”13Firing up his great coil, amid erupting thunderbolts, Tesla spoke as if asorcerer; he announced that with his knowledge he had the ability to makeanimate that which was inert. “With wonder and delight…[we note] the effects ofstrange forces which we bring into play, which allow us to transform, totransmit and direct energy at will…We see the mass of iron and wires behave asthough…endowed with life.”14Lamps suddenly burst forth in a variety of “magnificent colors of phosphorescentlight.” Tesla touched a wire, and sparks ejaculated from its end; he createdsheets of luminescence, directed electrical “streams upon small surfaces,” litwireless tubes simply by picking them up, and “erased” them by “holding a wirefrom a distant terminal” [i.e., grounding the effect] or by grasping the tubewith both hands, thereby “render[ing] dark” the area in between and pulling hishands apart in a steady stroke. And just as easily, he would rotate the tube inthe “direction of axis of the coil” and reignite the glow.15His theories on the relationship of wavelength to the structure and manufactureof light and his displays of wireless fluorescent tubes prompted one viewer topostulate that the future mode of lighting a dwelling might occur by actually“rendering the whole mass of the air in the room softly and beautifullyphosphorescent.”16Tesla unveiled the first true radio tube in this second month of 1892, in thepresence of all of the key forefathers of the invention of the wireless. Inorder to obtain the most perfect vacuum possible, the adept had extracted theair from a bulb that was contained inside another vacuum tube. Within this innerchamber, Tesla generated a beam of light “devoid of any inertia.” By producingextremely high frequencies, he created an electric “brush” that was so sensitivethat it responded even to the “stiffening of the muscles in a person’s arm!”This brush tended to “circle away” from an approaching person, but always in aclockwise direction. Noting that the ray was extremely “susceptible to magneticinfluences,” Tesla speculated that its direction of rotation was probablyaffected by the geomagnetic torque of the earth. He further expected that thisbrush would rotate counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Only a magnetcould get the stream of light to reverse its direction of rotation. “I am firmlyconvinced,” Tesla stated, “that such a brush, when we learn how to produce itproperly, may be the means of transmitting intelligence to a distance withoutwires.”17“Of all these phenomena,” Tesla began, in the next phase, “the most fascinatingfor an audience are certainly those which are noted in an electrostatic fieldacting through a considerable distance. By properly constructing a coil,” hecontinued, “I have found that I could excite vacuum tubes no matter where theywere held in the room.”18Referring to the work of J. J. Thomson and J. A. Fleming on the creation of aluminous thread within a vacuum tube, Tesla went on to discuss different methodsof exciting vacuum tubes by altering the wavelength or the length of the tube.Setting up a fan as an analog and discussing the research of Preece, Hertz, andLodge on the radiation of electromagnetic energy into the earth and space, Teslathen displayed “no wire” motors: “It is not necessary to have even a singleconnection between the motor and generator,” he announced, “except, perhaps,through the ground…[or] through the rarefied air…There is no doubt that withenormous potentials…luminous discharges might be passed through many miles ofrarefied air, and that, by thus directing the energy of many hundreds of horsepower, motors or lamps might be operated at considerable distances fromstationary sources.”19Based on research conducted the year before, which had been prompted by the workof J. J. Thomson in propagating streams of electrical energy, Tesla expandedupon his high-intensity button lamp, a device that could dematerialize or“vaporize” matter. This arrangement, as we shall see, is precisely theconfiguration required to create laser beams. Most likely, Tesla displayedactual laser beams at this time. However, neither he nor the other scientistspresent at the time recognized the unique importance of the directed ray, as itwas part of a combination of other lighting effects which resulted in thedisintegration of the material that was being bombarded.There are two types of standard lasers which correspond to Tesla’s work: (1) aruby laser, which reflects energy back to its source, which in turn stimulatesmore atoms into emitting special radiation, and (2) a gas laser, which consistsof a tube filled with helium and neon. High voltage is applied across twoelectrodes near the ends of the tube, causing a discharge to take place. In bothinstances, the excited atoms are contained in an enclosure and then reflectedinto one specific direction. They differ from ordinary flashlights not onlybecause they emit a uniform wavelength of light but also because there is apausing (metastable) state before the light is emitted.20Tesla worked with lamps constructed in exactly these ways. The first he called abutton lamp; the second, an exhausted or phosphorescent tube. Their primefunction was as efficient illumination devices. Their secondary functions wereas laboratory apparatus for a variety of experiments. In one tube filled with“rarefied gas…once the glass fibre is heated, the discharge breaks through itsentire length instantaneously.”21 Another bulb “was painted on one side with aphosphorescent powder or mixture and threw a dazzling light, far beyond thatyielded by any ordinary phosphorescence.”22“A common experiment [of mine]…was to pass through a coil energy at a rate ofseveral thousand horsepower, put a piece of thick tinfoil on a stick, andapproach it to that coil. The tinfoil would…not only melt, but…it would beevaporated and the whole process took place in so small an interval of time thatit was like a cannon shot…That was a striking experiment.”23Tesla also constructed a type of button lamp which could disintegrate anymaterial, including zirconia and diamonds, the hardest substances known toexist. The lamp was, in essence, a globe coated inside with a reflectivematerial (like the Leyden jar) and a “button” of any substance, most oftencarbon, which was highly polished and attached to a source of power. Onceelectrified, the button would radiate energy which would bounce off the interiorof the globe and back onto itself, thereby intensifying a “bombardment” effect.In this way the button would be “vaporized.”24Tesla next described precisely the invention of the ruby laser, over fivedecades before its reappearance in the middle of the twentieth century. Thedescription is quite explicit:> In an exhausted bulb we can concentrate any amount of energy upon a minute> button…[of] zirconia…[which] glowed with a most intense light, and the stream> of particles projected out…was of a vivid white…Magnificent light effects were> noted, of which it would be difficult to give an adequate idea…To illustrate> the effect observed with a ruby drop…at first one may see a narrow funnel of> white light projected against the top of the globe where it produces an> irregularly outlined phosphorescent patch…In this manner, an intensely> phosphorescent, sharply defined line [emphasis added] corresponding to the> outline of the drop [fused ruby] is produced, which spreads slowly over the> globe as the drop gets larger…A more perfect result used in some of these> bulbs [involves]…the construction of a zinc sheet, performing the double> office of intensifier and reflector.25The inventor’s talk ended with the speculation that with improvements in theconstruction of long-distance cables, per his suggestions, telephony across theAtlantic would soon be possible. It is significant to note that at this momenthe did not yet envision wireless transmission of voice, but rather wirelesstransmission of intelligence (i.e., Morse code), light, and power. Hisdiscussions with Preece, however, on the existence of earth currents wasbeginning to take hold, and shortly afterward, Tesla began to conceptualize theidea of transmitting voice and even pictures by means of wireless.“It has been my chief aim in presenting these results to point out phenomena orfeatures of novelty,” Tesla concluded, “and to advance ideas which I am hopefulwill serve as starting points of new departures. It has been my chief desirethis evening to entertain you with some novel experiments. Your applause, sofrequently and generously accorded, has told me that I have succeeded.”26At the end of the lecture “Mr. Tesla tantalizingly informed his listeners thathe had shown them but one-third of what he was prepared to do, and the wholeaudience…remained in their seats, unwilling to disperse, insisting upon more,and Mr. Tesla had to deliver a supplementary lecture…It may be stated, as Mr.Tesla mentioned but which hardly seems to be realized, that practically thewhole of the experiments shown were new, and had never been shown before, andwere not merely a repetition of those given in…America.”27Having seen the inventor handle such enormous voltages “so unconcernedly,” manyof the attendees mumbled surprise among themselves and gathered the courage toinquire how Tesla “dared to take the current through his body.”“It was the result of a long debate in my mind,” Tesla replied, “but thoughcalculation and reason, I concluded that such currents ought not to be dangerousto life any more than the vibrations of light are dangerous…Consider a thindiaphragm in a water-pipe with to and fro piston strikes of considerableamplitude, the diaphragm will be ruptured at once,” the inventor explained byanalogy. “With reduced strokes of the same total energy, the diaphragm will beless liable to rupture, until, with a vibratory impulse of many thousands persecond, no actual current flows, and the diaphragm is in no danger of rupture.So with the vibratory current.” In other words, Tesla had increased thefrequency, or alterations per second, but reduced the amplitude or powergreatly. The wizard thereupon fired up the coil once again, sending tens ofthousands of volts through (or around) his body and illuminated two fluorescenttubes which he held dramatically in each hand. “As you can, see,” Tesla added,“I am very much alive.”“That we can see,” one member responded, “but is there no pain?”“A spark, or course, passes through my hands, and may puncture the skin, andsometimes I receive an occasional burn, but that is all; and even this can beavoided if I hold a conductor of suitable size in my hand and then take hold ofthe current.”“In spite of your reasons,” another concluded with a shake of his head, “yourspeculation resembles to me the feelings that a man must have before plungingoff the Brooklyn Bridge.”28In listening to Tesla’s statement that he had only shown part of what he hadprepared, the perspicacious Professor Dewar, inventor of the Dewar flask, oreveryday hot or cold thermos, took the inventor at face value and realized thatthere was more information to impart. The wizard had simply run out of time. Asa member of the board of the Royal Institution, also situated in London, Dewarknew that there were many dignitaries who missed the grand event, especiallyLord Rayleigh, so he set himself the task of persuading Tesla to present anencore the following evening.After the talk Dewar escorted Tesla on a tour of the Royal Institution, where hedisplayed the work of his predecessors, especially Michael Faraday’s apparatus.“Why not stay for one more performance?” Dewar inquired.“I must go to Paris,” Tesla insisted, keeping foremost in his mind his desire tolimit the time of his visits at each stop so that he could return to the Statesas quickly as possible.“How often do you think you will have the chance to visit the laboratories ofsuch men as Crookes or Kelvin?” Dewar asked in his Scottish brogue. At the sametime, he invited Tesla to visit his own lab, where he was creating extremely lowtemperatures that approached absolute zero and conducting pioneer studies ofelectromagnetic effects in such environments as liquid oxygen.29 “You’ve alreadylived in Paris. Now see London!”“I was a man of firm resolve,” Tesla admitted later, “but succumbed easily tothe forceful arguments of the great Scotchman. He pushed me into a chair andpoured out half a glass of wonderful brown fluid which sparkled in all sorts ofiridescent colors and tasted like nectar.”“Now,” Dewar declared with a twinkle in his eye and a grin that brought one ofreciprocation on the face of his captive, “you are sitting in Faraday’s chairand you are enjoying whiskey he used to drink.”“In both aspects,” Tesla recalled, “it was an enviable experience. The nextevening I gave a demonstration before the Royal Institution.”30At the culmination of the lecture, much of which, again, was new material notpresented the previous evening (but integrated into the above discussion), Teslapresented Lord Kelvin with one of his Tesla coils,31 and Lord Rayleigh took overthe lectern for the conclusion. Tesla recalled, “He said that I possessed aparticular gift of discovery and that I should concentrate upon one big idea.”32Coming from this “ideal man of science,” one who had worked out mathematicalequations concerning the wavelength of light and who had also calculated theatomic weights of many of the elements, this suggestion made a great impression.A new sense of destiny swirled through Tesla as he began to realize that hewould have to figure out a way to surpass his earlier discoveries in AC.The next day, Tesla received an invitation from Ambrose Fleming to visit his labat University College on the weekend. Fleming had been successful in setting up“oscillatory discharges with a Spottiswoode Coil as the primary and Leyden jarsas the secondary,” and he wanted to show Tesla his results.33 Having been aconsultant to Edison in connection with the lighting industry, Fleming wouldfour years hence work with Marconi in the development of the wireless and a fewyears after that, come to invent the rectifier, a device for converting theincoming electromagnetic waves of AC into DC upon entering the receivingapparatus.34 Having attended both lectures, Fleming “congratulated [Tesla]heartily on your grand success. After th[is] no one can doubt yourqualifications as a magician of the first order.” The English aristocratconcluded by dubbing Tesla a member of the new fictitious “Order of the FlamingSword.”Tesla had sparked the imagination of his British colleagues, and rapidly anumber of them began to replicate his work and make their own advances. At SirWilliam Crookes’s lab, Tesla constructed a coil as a gift and taught Crookes howto build Tesla coils on his own, but Crookes complained: “The phosphorescencethrough my body when I hold one terminal is decidedly inferior to that givenwith the little one [that you made for me].”35As was his custom, Tesla toiled incessantly until the eclectic Crookes forcedhim to take a break, and at night, after dinner, the two scientists sat back andprognosticated. Topics ranged from discussions of the ramifications of their ownresearch and potential future of the field to religion, Tesla’s homeland, andmetaphysics.Twirling an elongated waxed mustache that fanned out like the tail feathers of abird of paradise, the bearded mentor revealed that he had experimented inwireless communication before even Hertz began his investigations in 1889.Crookes discussed the possibility that electrical waves would be able topenetrate solid objects, such as walls, and he argued against Kelvin’ssuggestion that the life force and electricity were at some level identical.“Nevertheless, electricity has an important influence upon vital phenomena, andis in turn set in action by the living being, animal or vegetable.” Here Crookeswas referring to various species, such as electric eels, iridescent sea slugs,and lightning bugs. Further speculation caused the two men to discuss thepossibility that electricity could be utilized to purify water and treat “sewageand industrial waste.”“Perhaps,” Crookes suggested, “proper frequencies could be generated toelectrify gardens so as to stimulate growth and make crops unappealing todestructive insects.”Expanding on the work of Rayleigh, Crookes discussed with Tesla the possibilityof setting up millions of separate wavelengths so as to ensure secrecy incommunication between two wireless operators. They also reviewed the work ofHelmholtz on the structure of the physical eye, noting that receptors on theretina are “sensitive to one set of wavelengths [i.e., visible light], andsilent to others.” In the same way, a receiving device for acceptingelectromagnetic signals might also be so constructed to receive certaintransmissions and not others.“Another point at which the practical electrician should aim,” Crookes said inresponse to one of Tesla’s more dauntless speculations, “is in the control ofweather.” Such goals as the elimination of fog or the ghastly “perennialdrizzle” that plagued the island and creation of great amounts of rain scheduledfor specific days were also discussed.36And if this were not enough, Crookes also introduced Tesla to a vigorousdiscussion of his experiments in mental telepathy, spiritualism, and even humanlevitation. As a member of the Society of Psychical Research and laterpresident, Crookes was in good company. Other scientists who would rise to thehelm of the psychic society included Oliver Lodge, J. J. Thomson, and LordRayleigh.37 Crookes straightforwardly presented a plethora of convincingevidence, including drawings by receivers that matched those created by senders,photographs from seances of ectoplasmic materializations generated by theclairvoyant Florence Cook, and eyewitness accounts of levitation by himself andhis wife.38Those statements were enough to raise the eyebrows of anyone, and they served torattle Tesla’s worldview. As a staunch materialist, up to that time Tesla hadabsolutely no belief in any aspect of the field of psychic research, includingrelatively tame occurrences, such as thought transference. But with Crookes’sdocumentation and the support of other members of the cognoscenti, especiallyLodge, and with Tesla already exhausted from the strain of his severe schedule,the Serb’s mind began to spin. He would drop off in the middle of conversationsand subsequently frightened his host. The reality that he had constructed andthe world of superstition he thought he had left behind when he emigrated fromthe Old World swarmed through his brain like a hive of bumblebees and shatteredmightily his worldview.The pressure Tesla was under caused Crookes to offer some friendly advice in aletter. “I hope you will get away to the mountains of your native land as soonas you can. You are suffering from over work, and if you do not take care ofyourself you will break down. Don’t answer this letter or see any one but takethe first train.” Ending the letter on a waggish note, Crookes added, “I amthinking of [going] myself, but I am only thinking of going as far asHastings.”39 Tesla wanted to take his advice, but he had to address the Parissociety first.Tesla crossed the English Channel during the second week of February and bookeda room at the Hotel de la Paix. At his upcoming lecture “before a jointconference of the Société de Physique and the Société International desElectriciens,” which was held on February 19,40 the inventor sought out thewell-known French physician Dr. d’Arsenoval, a pioneer in the field ofdiathermy. Tesla said later:> When…Dr. d’Arsenoval declared that he had made the same discovery [concerning> the physical effects caused by sending extremely high frequency through the> body], a heated controversy relative to priority was started. The French,> eager to honor their countryman, made him a member of the Academy, ignoring> entirely my earlier publication. Resolved to take steps for vindicating my> claim, I…met [with] Dr. d’Arsenoval. His personal charm disarmed me completely> and I abandoned my intention, content to rest on the record. It shows that my> disclosure antedated his and also that he used my apparatus in his> demonstrations. The final judgement is left to posterity.> > Since the beginning, the growth of the new art [of electrotherapy]…and> industry has been phenomenal, some manufacturers turning out daily hundreds of> sets.

Leaders in the profession have> assured me that I have done more for humanity by this medical treatment than> all my other discoveries and inventions.41(More recently, a number of researchers, particularly Dr. Robert O. Becker ofSyracuse University, have utilized electrical currents to help heal bones thathave difficulty knitting. Having studied regeneration capabilities of suchreptiles as salamanders whose tails he amputated, Becker has discovered thatthese animals generate a particular electrical frequency which serves somehow asa field for promoting the total regrowth of the missing appendage. By“artificially duplicating” the signal, Becker reports, “we have been able toproduce partial limb regeneration in [mammals such as] rats by a similartechnique, and some clinical applications are under study in human beings atthis time.”42)The Paris lecture ignited “the French papers…[with Tesla’s] brilliantexperiments. No man in our age has achieved such a universal scientificreputation in a single stride as this gifted young electrical engineer,” theElectrical Review reported.43Tesla met with a number of dignitaries while in Paris, including Prince Albertof Belgium, who was interested in supplying his country with a more economicalmeans of distributing electric power; Monsieur Luka, of the Helios Company ofCologne, with whom Tesla sold his AC motor patents for use in Germany;44 andAndré Blondel, an important theoretician in advanced theories with alternatingcurrents.Forty years later, Blondel recalled “with immense interest and admiration” theParis conference and congratulated Tesla on the elegant simplicity with which headvanced his concepts in alternating current well beyond the work of his Frenchcolleague Deprez and his Italian neighbor Ferraris.45Shortly after the lecture and in a state of “oblivion” associated by “mypeculiar sleeping spells, which had been caused by prolonged exertion of thebrain,” Tesla received a dispatch at the hotel informing him that his mother wasdying. “I remembered how I made the long journey home without an hour ofrest.”46 Greeted in Gospić by his three sisters, all of whom were married toSerbian priests, and by his Uncle Petar, the regional bishop, Tesla was in aterrible state. Entering the bedroom, he found his mother in “agony.”During this time, Tesla suffered from a peculiar malady similar to amnesia;where he claimed to have lost all memory of his earlier life. He also said thathe slowly regained this information before his return to the States. One aspectof this episode which is noteworthy is that it occurred over a long period oftime, beginning at the close of 1891, and culminating with his mother’s death inApril 1892. Tesla said that although he could not remember historicaloccurrences, he had no trouble thinking about the details of his researchincluding “passages of text” from his writings “and complex mathematicalformulae.”47 Simultaneously, Tesla also experienced a psychic event which“momentarily impressed me as supernatural. I had become completely exhausted bypain and long vigilance, and one night was carried to a building about twoblocks from our home. As I lay helpless there, I thought that if my mother diedwhile I was away from her bedside she would surely give me a sign.”48Having been influenced by “my…friend Sir William Crookes, when spiritualism wasdiscussed,” Tesla lay in anticipation. “During the whole night every fiber in mybrain was strained in expectancy, but nothing happened until early in themorning. [Awakening in] a swoon, [I] saw a cloud carrying angelic figures ofmarvelous beauty, one of whom gazed upon me lovingly and gradually assumed thefeatures of my mother. The appearance slowly floated across the room andvanished, and I was awakened by an indescribably sweet song of many voices. Inthat instant [or] certitude, [I knew] that my mother had just died. And that wastrue.”49Surprised and perhaps even frightened by the clairvoyant vision, Tesla wrote toCrookes for advice. For months, and maybe even for years after, the inventor“sought…the external cause of this strange manifestation.” Note how Teslaassumes a priori that the cause came from “outside” as opposed to “inside,” thatis, from the unconscious. Although he readily accepted the concept of wirelesscommunication, in no way was Tesla capable of allowing for the possibility thatthe human brain could also act as a receiver of mental vibrations. The idea oftelepathy, or spiritualism, for that matter, was a true threat to the paradigmhe was operating from, and so Tesla manufactured a physical mechanism as thecause of his noetic experience:“To my great relief,” Tesla wrote, “I succeeded after many months of fruitlesseffort” in solving the conundrum. The vision of the angels rising up, Teslaattributed to the memory of an ethereal painting of the same subject which hehad gazed on prior to the experience, and the sound of the serenading voices, helinked to a nearby church choir that was singing for an Easter mass.50 Whetheror not Tesla’s mother died on a Sunday morning is not known. But what is clearis that this analysis greatly relieved the tension Tesla was under, for itsupported, once again, a materialistic viewpoint.A question which remains, however, is whether or not Tesla’s excesses inwork-related endeavors is enough to explain his onset of amnesia? Onetheoretician speculated that the enormous voltages that Tesla passed through hisbody may have contributed to the problem.51 From a psychoanalytic point of view,one could speculate that Tesla was repressing, that is, unconsciously, butpurposefully forgetting events that he did not want to remember. Possibleunwanted memories included the way he felt as a child after his exalted brotherdied and the recent eradication of the royalty clause with the WestinghouseCorporation.After the death of his mother, Tesla stayed on in Gospić for six weeks torecuperate. On the positive side, it enabled the lone son to reconfirm emotionalties to his family; it also provided Tesla with probably the only extendedvacation he would ever take.He traveled to Plaski to visit his sister Marica, to Varazdin to see his unclePajo, and to Zagreb to lecture at the university. He sojourned to Budapest toconfer with Ganz & Company, as they were in the midst of constructing asubstantial 1,000-horsepower alternator. He also met with a delegation ofSerbian scientists who accompanied him down to Belgrade, where an audience wasarranged with the king. Young Alexander I conferred upon Tesla a special titleof Grand Officer of the Order of St. Sava, and the official plaque was shippedto him a few months later after his return to the States.52 Tesla also visitedthe great Serbian poet Jovan Zmaj Jovanovich,53 and he attended an assemblywhere he was honored by the mayor.In front of a welcoming committee, Zmaj read his poem “Pozdrav Nikoli Tesli,”and then Tesla took the podium. “There is something in me which is only perhapsillusory,” Tesla began, “[It is] like that which often comes to young,enthusiastic persons; but if I were to be sufficiently fortunate to bring aboutat least some of my ideas it would be for the benefit of all humanity.”Referring back to Zmaj’s poem, Tesla concluded with a message that would deeplytouch the hearts of his people. “If these hopes become one day a reality, mygreatest joy would spring from the fact that this work would be the work of aSerb.”54On his return leg, Tesla made a special trip through Prussia to see the eminentpatriarch Hermann Ludwig von Helmholtz, in Berlin, and his most famous student,Heinrich Hertz, in Bonn. A bearded, youthful man with soft features, a highforehead, and elongated face, Hertz had gained the world’s attention byperforming the first significant experiments in wireless, many of which Teslareplicated or expanded upon.In attempts to clarify the findings of James Clerk Maxwell on the nature ofelectromagnetic phenomena and its relationship to light and the structure of theether, in 1886, Hertz constructed “flat double-wound spiral coils” which he usedin induction experiments in attempts to measure the propagation ofelectromagnetic waves. Hertz, like Tesla shortly after him, displayed resonanceeffects between primary and secondary circuits and “established the existence ofstanding waves with their characteristic nodes and troughs in a long straightwire.” He was also able to measure the wavelength of the waves in the wire.55Hertz, however, differed markedly with Tesla in terms of his interpretation ofthe meaning of Maxwell’s equations and his subsequent conceptualization of thestructure of the ether.Deriving his clarifications more from theory than from actual experimentation,Hertz had created an elegant mathematical interpretation of Maxwell’s equations,but at the expense of some aspects of Maxwell’s theory, most notably vector (aquantity that has magnitude and direction) and scalar (a quantity that hasmagnitude, but no direction, such as a point or field) potentials. Induplicating Hertz’s work, Tesla postulated that these components should not havebeen eliminated.56 What he tried to tell Hertz, and what he wrote a few monthslater, was that electromagnetic waves might “more appropriately [be] calledelectric sound-waves or sound-waves of electrified air.”57“When Dr. Heinrich Hertz undertook his experiments from 1887 to 1889,” Teslatold an interviewer, “his object was to demonstrate a theory postulating amedium filling all space called the ether, which was structureless, ofinconceivable tenuity…and yet possessed of [great] rigidity. He obtained certainresults and the whole world acclaimed them as an experimental verification ofthat cherished theory, but in reality what he observed tended to prove just itsfallacy.“I had maintained for many years before that such a medium as supposed could notexist, and that we must rather accept the view that all space is filled with agaseous substance. On repeating the Hertz experiments with much improved andvery powerful apparatus, I satisfied myself that what he had observed wasnothing else but effects of longitudinal waves in a gaseous medium, that is tosay, waves propagated by alternating compression and expansion [emphasis added].He had observed waves in much of the nature of sound waves in the air,” nottransverse electromagnetic waves, as generally supposed.58Tesla tried to open a dialogue by noting that his experiments tended tocontradict the polished mathematical results Hertz had achieved, but Hertzrebuked him. “He seemed disappointed to such a degree,” Tesla recalled, “that Iregretted my trip and parted from him sorrowfully.”59Having replicated Hertz’s experiments, Tesla tried to show the German professorthat his own oscillator could produce a much more efficient frequency fortransmitting wireless impulses. Tesla already had his eye on the idea oftransmitting power through the ambient medium, and the Hertzian paradigmvirtually disallowed this possibility. But egos clashed, as one Weltanschauungthreatened the other, and Hertz would never come to realize that his device wasobsolete. Perhaps this was to Hertz’s advantage, for even to this day wirelessfrequencies are referred to as Hertzian waves, when, in fact, they are reallyTesla’s, as they are produced by high-frequency continuous-wave oscillators, notby the primitive Hertzian interrupted spark-gap apparatus.60During the voyage home, Tesla walked the deck of the ship and pondered anincident that occurred to him during a hike he had taken in the mountains duringthe trip. Having witnessed an oncoming thunderstorm, he had noted that the rainwas delayed until a flash of lightning was perceived. This “observation”confirmed Tesla’s speculations, with Martin and Crookes, that weather controlwas possible because it was the production of large amounts of electricity, inTesla’s eyes, that caused the downpour.Revealing a megalomaniacal streak, Tesla recalled his thoughts that day in theAlps:> Here was a stupendous possibility of achievement. If we could produce electric> effects of the required quality, this whole planet and the conditions of> existence on it could be transformed. The sun raises the water of the oceans> and the winds drive it to distant regions where it remains in a state of most> delicate balance. If it were in our power to upset it when and wherever> desired, this mighty life-sustaining stream could be at will controlled. We> could irrigate arid deserts, create lakes and rivers and provide motive power> in unlimited amounts…It seemed a hopeless undertaking, but I made up my mind> to try it, and immediately upon my return to the United States in the summer> of 1892, work was begun…for the successful transmission of energy without> wires.61"},{"pageContent":"11FATHER OF THE WIRELESS (1893) [002-toc.html#ch11]> The day when we shall know exactly what “electricity” is, will chronicle an> event probably greater, more important than any other recorded in the history> of the human race.

Setup on the “European plan” by Charles A. Gerlach, its manager, the Gerlach wasequipped with “elevators, electric lights and sumptuous dining rooms.” Theestablishment was family oriented and fireproof.4Located on Twenty-seventh Street, between Broadway and Sixth Avenue, the Gerlachwas just a few blocks from the new, magnificent Madison Square Garden, a moderngalleria with shops, theaters, restaurants, a thirty-story tower, and a coliseumwith a seating capacity of seventeen thousand. The Garden, which was still underconstruction, was financed by banker J. Pierpont Morgan, who was funding Edisonat the time; and it was designed and managed by Stanford White, the flamboyantarchitect of the prestigious firm of McKim, Mead & White, who would later becomean important associate of Tesla’s.Having unpacked his bags and cache of missives at the new hotel, on he went toSouth Fifth Avenue to his lab, which he had been away from for so long. In longstrides, the inventor weaved his way through “Washington Square, [to] the heartof that picturesque neighborhood known as the French quarter. [The streets were]teeming with cheap restaurants, wine shops and weather-beaten tenements,”establishments Tesla would never frequent himself. To his surprise, he noticedshop owners waving, whispering among themselves; some even displayed awe. Havingbeen elected to the Royal Society of Great Britain, now he had become acélébrite internationale and the neighborhood had been awaiting his return. Hecame upon what one reporter described as the “uninviting…huge yellowish brickbuilding of some half-dozen stories”5 which housed his lab. Eagerly, the “murkyinterior” was entered as Tesla traversed the stairs, taking two at a time. Heclimbed past the oily, smelly lower floors, which were devoted to a pipe-cuttingfactory, even managed a smile for the owners of the dry-cleaning service on thethird floor, and then entered his secluded haven on the fourth.The inventor had brought a number of books which he had purchased abroad, and heplaced them in his library before proceeding into the machine room, where hespent some time removing dust and cobwebs. Tesla’s prime concern was to exploithis advances in fluorescent lighting and wireless transmission of power. Overthe next few weeks he hired several workers and a secretary and began bydictating an article on experiments he had conducted with Hertzian frequenciesand their relationship to the surrounding medium.6 He refined his oscillatorsand designed an experiment whereby one of the terminals of a sizable transmitterwas attached to one of the city’s water mains, and he recorded electricalvibrations at different positions around town. “By varying the frequency,” hesaid, “I was able to watch for evidence of resonance effects at variousdistances…I think that beyond doubt it is possible to operate electrical devicesin a city through the ground or pipe system by resonance from an electricaloscillator located at a central point.”7 Using vacuum tubes and other tunedcircuits as detectors, Tesla began to study the principles of harmonics andstanding waves, noting that his instruments would respond at certain pointsalong the pipes but not at other positions.There was also mail to answer and equipment to order. In Septembercorrespondence was begun with Mr. Fodor, a German scientist who, with Tesla’shelp, translated his world-famous discourses into German.8 Shortly thereafter,Thomas Edison sent an inscribed photograph “To Tesla from Edison.”9 Tesla alsoconferred with Professor R. H. Thurston, a physics teacher from Cornell who hadexpertise in thermodynamics.10At the end of the month George Westinghouse stopped by with Albert Schmid towelcome the inventor home and discuss the fate of the Tesla AC system.11 In Mayof that year, Westinghouse had won the bid to furnish the power for the upcomingColumbian Exposition, which was going to be held in Chicago, and he reportedlyhad taken a million dollar loss in order to secure the contract. But even atthis juncture he was still not convinced that the Tesla system would prove to bemore useful than compressed air and hydraulic power for long-distancetransmissions.12 Although Tesla had great respect for the descendent of Russiannoblemen, he still had difficulty hiding his dissatisfaction. Schmid wasrelieved that the burden of convincing Westinghouse had shifted.“My conviction, Mr. Westinghouse, is that a motor without brushes and commutatoris the only form which is capable of permanent success. To consider other plansI consider a mere waste of time and money.”13Westinghouse asked for Tesla’s help, particularly in aiding Schmid, Scott, andLamme, and Tesla agreed.Having been assured once again that the Tesla system was all that it promised tobe and more, Westinghouse returned to Pittsburgh with a new sense of purpose.“In the early part of 1893,” Lamme wrote, “much entirely new and novel apparatuswas built for our Chicago World’s Fair Exhibit.”14 Tesla would commute to andfrom Pittsburgh during this hectic time to guide the workers on the constructionof the large dynamos, or Lamme, Schmid, or Scott would stop by in New York foradvice. They were also helping Tesla construct his own exhibit, which wouldappear under the Westinghouse banner. Scott was in charge of resurrectingTesla’s ingenious spinning egg, a device which not only aptly displayed theprinciples of the rotating magnetic field but also paid homage to ChristopherColumbus, the explorer whose accomplishments were being honored on this 400thanniversary of his transatlantic journey. Hence the title of the fair: theColumbian Exposition. The fair was slated to open in May, and this gave themonly a few months to complete what was truly a Herculean task.Westinghouse may have won the right to light the fair, but Edison would notallow him a license to produce his lightbulb. Fortunately for Westinghouse, hedid have a viable patent on a Sawyer-Man “stopper lamp,” which had a rubberbottom where the filament was attached in place of the Edison all-glassevacuated construction. Although less efficient, the Sawyer-Man lamp worked.With less than six months left until opening day, he had to produce 250,000 ofthese inferior bulbs. Coupled with the costs of legal disputes, the company wasinvolved in a great risk venture. However, the prize, if all went successfully,would be the right to harness Niagara Falls. Potential revenues from such acontract would be immense.Tesla arranged for Mr. Luka of the Helios Company of Cologne, to come toPittsburgh to discuss supplying the German concern with AC equipment for theircontract in Germany. “He has been sent here to gather information about railway,steam and other motors,” Tesla told Westinghouse. “I believe they would be readyto make a small cash payment and pay a moderate royalty, and I have done what Icould to facilitate an understanding.”15 Tesla had also secured other Europeanconnections, and soon revenues from abroad began to roll in.Nevertheless, there remained a good deal of animosity toward Tesla by some othermembers of the Westinghouse organization, partially because Tesla was paid sohandsomely for an invention that they considered had also been conceived byShallenberger and partially because they simply did not like the pompousforeigner. There were also great financial costs incurred in dismantling thehundreds of profitable Gaulard-Gibbs power stations which were dotted across thenation.In November 1892, Grover Cleveland, former hangman and sheriff of Buffalo,running on an antilabor ticket, was re-elected president of the United States.Cleveland’s second inauguration inflamed many segments of the population and nodoubt helped trigger the Panic of 1893.The calamity began in 1892 with the financial collapse of four major railroads.Then banks failed, and tens of thousands of people became unemployed;16 and theWestinghouse Company was just beginning a decade-long course of incurringenormous debt. Westinghouse realized that he had to back Tesla unconditionallyas the sole inventor of the AC polyphase system. Had there been any ambiguity inthe matter, competitors could seize an advantage by obscuring the origins of theinvention, and thus they would be able to produce Teslaic technology withoutroyalty payments to Westinghouse.On January 16, 1893, Westinghouse came out with an announcement touting theTesla multiphase, or polyphase, system which was circulated to the electricalmagazines and major competitors. Having “secured exclusive right to manufactureand sell apparatus covered by [Tesla’s] patents” the Westinghouse companypromised to use such apparatus to economically harness the many waterfalls whichwere wasting so much energy.Now that the problems in Pittsburgh were somewhat alleviated, Tesla could devotemore time to his upcoming lectures, which were going to be held at the FranklinInstitute in Philadelphia at the end of February and again, the following week,in March at the annual meeting of the National Electric Light Association in St.Louis. He was met in Philadelphia by Prof. Edwin Houston, formerly the partnerof Houston’s former student, Elihu Thomson.Tesla began his lecture in Philadelphia with a discussion of the human eye,“nature’s masterpiece…It is the great gateway through which all knowledge entersthe mind…It is often said, the very soul shows itself in the eye.”17The study of the eye suggested a number of different and distinct lines ofinquiry. For instance, it enabled Tesla to envision the precursor to television,with its numerous transfiguring pixels corresponding to the light-sensitivereceiving cells of the retina. In another vein, in conjunction with instrumentssuch as microscopes and telescopes, the eye also opened up new vistas forscientific inquiry. Alluding to the concept of the plurality of worlds, Teslawould say, “It was an organ of a higher order.”18“It is conceivable,” Tesla continued, “that in some other world, in some otherbeings, the eye is replaced by a different organ, equally or more perfect, butthese beings cannot be men.”19Obtaining information from all corners of the universe, at the same time, theeye interacted with that elusive realm called the mind. Furthermore, this organwas also a perfect analog of Tesla’s Aristotlean worldview, as the eye had to betriggered from an external source in order to function.20If we go back to one of Tesla’s earlier experiments with the “brush phenomena,”that is, the creation of a brush or stream of light generated within aninsulated vacuum bulb that responded to the faintest electromagneticreverberations, we see that to Tesla this precursor to the radio tube wasactually based on the principles inherent in the construction of the human eye.The brush, we remember, not only reacted to magnetic influences but also to theapproach of a person and to the torque of the earth, just as the eye also reactsto faint impulses from near or far. It is “the only organ capable of beingaffected directly by the vibrations of the ether.”21The ether was a nineteenth-century theoretical construct of an all-pervasivemedium between the planets and stars. In 1881, Michelson and Morelyunsuccessfully tried to measure the ether in their famous experiment with lightbeams and mirrors. The ramifications of their findings did not become evidentuntil after the turn of the century, a full decade after Tesla’s lecture, whenEinstein used the Michelson-Morley experiment to suggest that, by its nature,“the ether cannot be detected,”22 and further, that it was unnecessary forexplaining how light could travel through space.Physics professor Edwin Gora, of Providence College, whose mentors includedArnold Sommerfeld and Werner Heisenberg, stated that the ether could not bedetected with nineteenth-century techniques and that Einstein replaced the oldether with a new non-Euclidean space-time construct. This new more abstractether had such unusual properties as allowing space to curve aroundgravitational bodies.Completely disagreeing with Einstein, and never abandoning the concept of theall-pervasive either, Tesla said that space cannot be curved because “somethingcannot act upon nothing.” Light, according to Tesla, bent around stars andplanets because they were attracted by a force field.23 Gora agreed that the twoconcepts of curved space and force field may actually be different viable waysof describing the same thing.Returning to the 1893 lecture, for Tesla, the relationship of electricalphenomena to the structure of the ether appeared to be an important key tounderstanding how it could be transmitted without wires in an efficient manner.The problem of the transmission of electromagnetic energy through space wasdiscussed in all three of his lectures on high-frequency phenomena. One questionhe considered was whether the ether was motionless or in motion. When vibrationswere transmitted through it, it appeared to act like a still lake, but at othertimes, the ether acted like “a fluid to the motion of bodies through it.”Referring to the investigations of Kelvin, Tesla concluded that the ether mustbe in motion. “But regardless of this, there is nothing which would enable us toconclude with certainty that, while a fluid is not capable of transmittingtransverse vibrations of a few hundred or thousand per second, it might not becapable of transmitting such vibrations when they range into hundreds of millionmillions per second.”24Tesla would later claim spectacular results in wireless transmission neverduplicated by any other researcher; he states that his system was not bound tothe inverse-square laws, and it appears that his success, if indeed it was asuccess(!), was based on the premise that above certain frequencies the etherrevealed novel and heretofore unknown features. Perhaps threshold values wereinvolved.Tesla continued his discussion on the structure of the ether and itsrelationship to electromagnetic phenomena by making two observations: (1) “thatenergy [could be transmitted] by independent carriers” and (2) that atomic andsubatomic particles whirled around each other like little solar systems.25 Thesetwo concepts, which were tied to the mystery of the structure of the ether,predated similiar ideas proposed by quantum physicists Ernest Rutherford, NielsBohr, and Albert Einstein by at least a decade.In Rutherford’s case, he is often credited as the first physicist to view theatom as structured somewhat like a solar system. It is evident, however, thatRutherford referred to Tesla’s high-frequency lectures in 1895, when heconstructed high-frequency AC equipment for conducting long-distance wirelessexperiments.26Tesla stated that he could create electromagnetic oscillations that displayedtransverse and also longitudinal wave characteristics. The first (transverse)case corresponds to the concept of the ether as a medium for propagatingwavelike impulses; and the second (longitudinal) case corresponds to what todayis known as a quantum of energy analogous to the way sound waves travel throughair. Tesla maintained, against all opposition, even to this day, that hiselectromagnetic frequencies traveled in longitudinal, bulletlike impulses, andthus they carried much more energy than can be ascribed to Hertzian transversewaves. In fact, as alluded to before, Hertz wanted to eliminate the idea of massfrom the Maxwellian electromagnetic equations.image 2 [images/image-02.jpg]A drawing depicting Nikola Tesla displaying wireless experiments at the ChicagoWorld’s Fair of 1893.Tesla’s idea of longitudinal waves in the ether appear to be a directoutcropping of the research undertaken by Ernst Mach, who was still at Prague atthe time. Mach’s radical views on the relationship between consciousness, spaceand time, and the nature of gravity were beginning to alter greatly the thinkingof a number of key individuals. His idea, which came to be known as “Mach’sPrinciple,” hypothesized that all things in the universe were interrelated, forexample, the mass of the earth, according to this theory, was dependent on asupergravitational force from all stars in the universe. Nothing was separate.This view, which Mach realized corresponded to Buddhist thinking, paralleledclosely views espoused by Tesla. Although the following quote was written almosta quarter of a century later, its link to Tesla’s 1893 lecture is clear: “Thereis no thing endowed with life—from man, who is enslaving the elements, to thenimblest creature—in all this world that does not sway in its turn. Wheneveraction is born from force, though it be infinitesimal, the cosmic balance isupset and universal motion results.”27This idea was extended and interlinked between living organisms and inert matterby Tesla. All are “susceptible to stimulus from the outside. There is no gapbetween, no break of continuity, no special and distinguishing vital agent. Thesame law governs all matter, all the universe is alive.”28 The source of powerwhich runs the universe is that found within “the sun’s heat and light. Whereverthey are there is life.” As these processes were electrical in nature, to Tesla,the secret of electricity held the secret of life.Looking at the world around him, Tesla realized that it was a finite place andthat the natural resources which gave humans the fuel to produce electricitywould eventually run out. “What will man do when the forests disappear, when thecoal deposits are exhausted?” he asked his Philadelphia audience. “Only onething, according to our present knowledge, will remain; that is to transmitpower at great distances. Man will go to the waterfalls, [and] to the tides,”Tesla speculated, because these, unlike coal and oil reserves, arereplenishable.29Having set up the premise that it could be possible to derive inexhaustibleamounts of energy with properly constructed equipment, that is, “to attach ourengines to the wheelwork of the universe,” Tesla described, for the first timeever, his invention of wireless transmission. Cloaking his true goals in morepalatable language, he announced, “I…firmly believe that it is practicable todisturb by means of powerful machines the electrostatic conditions of the earthand thus transmit intelligible signals and perhaps power.” Taking intoconsideration the speed of electrical impulses, with this new technology,“all…ideas of distance must…vanish,” as humans will be instantaneouslyinterconnected. “First, we must know what capacity the earth is, and what chargeit contains.” Tesla also speculated that the earth was “probably a charged bodyinsulated in space and” and thus had a “low capacity.” The upper strata, muchlike the vacuum created in his Geissler tubes, would probably be an excellentmedium for transmitting impulses.30 We see here the precursor to the discoveryby Heaviside and Kennelly of the ionosphere. Tesla had already thrust largeamounts of electrical energy into the earth to try to measure its period offrequency, but he had yet to come up with a figure that appeared accurate.Nevertheless, he knew the size of the earth and the speed of light and thus wasalready at this time formulating optimum wavelengths for transmitting impulsesthrough the planet.During his talk, Tesla demonstrated impedance phenomena by turning on and off alightbulb by placing it at various positions along an electrified metal bar.Based somewhat on the work of Hertz, this experiment demonstrated the conceptsof wavelength and standing waves. He constructed circuits with two or threebulbs independently connected in a row and placed metal bars at various pointsalong the way, thereby illuminating or extinguishing one or another of thesebulbs by impeding or not impeding the electrical flow. He also displayedelectric lamps illuminated with only a single wire and therefore was able toestablish that the wire itself could be replaced by connecting the lamp directlyto the earth, which also was a conductor, as no return circuit (as found in theEdison bulbs) was necessary. As before, Tesla also displayed lamps illuminatedwith no connections whatsoever.With pure resonance, Tesla suggested, wires become unnecessary, since impulsescan be “jumped” from sending device to receiver. Naturally, the receivinginstruments would have to be tuned to the frequency of the transmitter. “If everwe can ascertain at what period the earth’s charge, when disturbed [or]oscillates with respect to an oppositely electrified system or known circuit, weshall know a fact possibly of the greatest importance to the welfare of thehuman race.”31Tesla proceeded to present a diagram which depicted how to set up the aerials,receivers, transmitter, and ground connection. The son of one of his assistantsdescribed the apparatus:> In the transmitter group on one side of the stage was a 5-kva high-voltage> pole-type oil filled distribution transformer connected to a condenser bank of> Leyden jars, a spark gap, a coil and a wire running up to the ceiling. In the> receiving group at the other side of the stage was an identical wire hanging> from the ceiling, a duplicate condenser bank of Leyden jars and a coil—but> instead of the spark gap, there was a Geissler tube that would light up…when> voltage was applied. When the switch was closed, the transformer grunted and> groaned, the Leyden jars showed corona sizzling around their foil edges, the> spark gap crackled with a noisy spark discharge, and an invisible> electromagnetic field radiated energy into space from the transmitter antenna> wire [to the receiver antenna wire].32Tesla elaborated: “When the electric oscillation is set up,” he said, “therewill be a movement of electricity in and out of [the transmitter], andalternating currents will pass through the earth…In this manner neighboringpoints on the earth’s surface within a certain radius will be disturbed.”Although Tesla’s main goal was to transmit power, he also noted that“theoretically,…it [w]ould not require a great amount of energy to produce adisturbance perceptible at great distance, or even all over the surface of theglobe.”33In Tesla’s autobiography, written a quarter of a century later, the inventorinforms the reader that there was such opposition to his discussion of wirelesstelegraphy at that time that “only a small part of what I had intended to saywas embodied [in the speech]…This little salvage from the wreck has earned methe title ‘Father of the Wireless.’”34 Tesla stated that it was Joseph Wetzlerwho told him to deemphasize his work in wireless in this lecture. Wetzlerprobably edited out a number of key passages which, in the long run, could havehelped Tesla establish more easily his priorities in the field. Nevertheless,the entire Philadelphia speech runs a hundred typeset pages and covers numerousother topics as well. What is important to realize is that for the first timeever, a major inventor announced bold possibilities in the field of wirelesscommunication; simultaneously, he explained in step-by-step fashion all of themajor components that would be needed for success.The question of who invented the radio is complex, for there was no singledeveloper. Experiments in wireless can be traced back to Joseph Henry, who, in1842, transmitted electrical energy across a thirty-foot room between magnetizedneedles and sensitive Leyden jars, and to Samuel Morse, who sent messages in1847 by means of induction across an eighty-foot-wide canal by using somethingcalled “current leakage.”35The first individual to transmit messages over long distances using aerials (inthe form of kites) and a ground connection was Mahlon Loomis. A dentist andexperimentalist who also used electricity to stimulate growth in plants, Loomisnot only received a patent on the device in 1872 but also successfullyintroduced the “Loomis Aerial Telegraphy Bill” before the U.S. Congress. Loomismade such an impact that $50,000 was appropriated to help him in his pursuit. In1886, Loomis sent wireless messages fourteen miles between two mountains inVirginia, and a few years later, he also sent messages between ships two milesapart in Chesapeake Bay. There is little doubt that Tesla was aware of Loomis.For one thing, his patent was registered, and Tesla always made it a practice tostudy the work of his precursors. Also, it should be noted that some of thewording from Loomis’s patent applications and published writings sound eerilylike the wording in some of Tesla’s discourses. For instance, Loomis discussesthe passing of “electrical vibrations or waves around the world,” and principlesof harmonics and resonance, and he also refers to harnessing “the wheelwork ofnature,” a favored term of Tesla’s.36In 1875, Thomas Edison, while working with Charles Batchelor, noticed an unusualsparking effect emanating from the core of an electromagnet which leaped tononcharged bodies several feet away. By using an electroscope, he was unable todistinguish a charge.37 In actuality, he had created a high frequency that couldnot be detected by his equipment. “By charging a gas main, Edison was able toobtain sparks from the fixtures in his house several blocks away…Edison thoughtthat since energy can take various forms, and it was possible to changeelectricity to magnetism, magnetism might be transformed into something else.”38Edison therefore announced to the scientific community that he had discovered anew “unknown force.” Possibly, Tesla’s ideas of connecting an oscillator to thewater mains of a city may have been influenced by this research.In the early 1880s, William Preece, electrical engineer for the British PostOffice, began directing experiments in wireless communication by means of aninductive apparatus. He was probably also the first inventor to realize that theearth itself was an integral component in the successful implementation of anywireless system. After isolating the role of the earth as either a primary orsecondary circuit, Preece utilized telephone receivers as detecting devices andconcluded that “on ordinary working telegraph lines the disturbance reached adistance of 3,000 feet, while effects were detected on parallel lines of atelegraph 10 to 40 miles apart in some sections of the country.” Preece’s workof detecting earth currents, which was duplicated by Western Union engineers inthe United States, significantly influenced the theories expounded by Tesla.39Preece had displayed a long-standing interest in wireless communications. He hadvisited Edison in the mid-1880s, just after Tesla emigrated to America, towitness firsthand Edison’s latest invention, which he called the “grasshoppertelegraph,” a device for jumping messages from dispatch stations to movingtrains. By means of induction or resonance, a metal strip attached to atelephone receiver on a moving railroad car would send or receive messages froma similar strip strung parallel to the track at the station. Although theinvention never evolved beyond this primitive early stage, the patent wouldlater have important legal significance in priority battles over the inventionof the wireless.Thus, Edison is clearly one of the fathers of wireless transmission, as areHenry, Morse, Loomis, and Preece. Concerning the history of radio tubes, Edisonalso had an important invention, discussed above, of a dualfilament lightbulbwhich displayed a flow of current between them, Preece having named it the“Edison effect.” J. J. Thomson used it to help in his discovery of the electron,and Tesla combined information from this device with Crookes’s work on radiationeffects inside evacuated glass tubes to invent his “brush phenomena,” which wasthe first such vacuum tube explicitly created for wireless transmission ofintelligence.Other precursors to Tesla included Heinrich Hertz, Oliver Lodge, and EdouardBranly. A French professor of physics, Branly, perhaps influenced by theknowledge of the Edison effect, noticed that the gap of Hertz’s tuned circuitscould be replaced by a glass-enclosed tube which contained finely scatteredmetallic particles. When current passed through the tube by means of wirelessinduction, the particles aligned themselves along the path of the gap and closedthe circuit. A light tapping on the tube opened the circuit once again untiltransmission occurred. Lodge perfected Branly’s 1890 discovery of particlecohesion and labeled it the “coherer.”40These scientists were not thinking about “wireless telegraphy” at the time oftheir initial work. They were explorers in a new field of electromagneticinduction, and it was not until 1894, by Lodge’s own calculation, that hethought in terms of utilizing the equipment as a means of conveyinginformation.41 On the other hand, we remember that Crookes, writing in 1892, atthe very time he was meeting with Tesla in England, noted that he hadexperimented in the wireless transmission of Morse code from one end of a houseto another at about the same time as Hertz and Lodge were experimenting in thelate 1880s, but he never publicized his work or furthered the invention beyondthis casual experiment.Tesla realized, as did Hertz, that the Hertzian frequencies through space werenot conductive for long-range communication, but unlike Hertz, Tesla sought away around this limiting factor. Therefore, he devised not only the means ofsecuring more powerful transmitters but also “concatenated tuned circuits,”which were, in essence, sensitive radio tubes for receiving information.42During this speech in Philadelphia, Tesla also introduced the concept of usingboth an aerial and ground connection and a single wire as a return for theoperation of “all kinds of devices.” This system of wireless transmission wasoutlined in detail in highly visible articles which appeared in 1891, during hisfirst public demonstrations of wireless Geissler tubes at Columbia College, in1892 in Europe, and were explicitly delineated in 1893. It would be another fullyear before a high school boy by the name of Guglielmo Marconi would begin hisfirst tinkerings in the field."},{"pageContent":"12ELECTRIC SORCERER (1893) [002-toc.html#ch12]> It was known that Mr. Tesla, who enjoys a high reputation as an electrician,> had been experimenting upon a practically new electric light, but it was not> known outside his laboratory that he had achieved such wonderful results or> come so near [to] revolutionizing the theory of light.

Accompanied by T. C. Martin, who wascovering both lectures for Electrical Engineer, they discussed the creation of atextbook based on the inventor’s collected writings. The first half would bedevoted to the full range of inventions associated with the AC polyphase system,with chapters on motor design, single phase and polyphase circuits, armatures,and transformers; the second half would contain Tesla’s three discourses onhigh-frequency phenomena, which he had presented in New York, London, andPhiladelphia. With an introduction written by Martin and a few miscellaneousarticles at the end, the treatise would run almost five hundred pages. JoshWetzler would be second editor. Publication date was set for the end of theyear.Martin had achieved a great coup, solidifying a deal with what many people weresaying was “the greatest living electrician.”2 The Inventions, Researches andWritings of Nikola Tesla would be a landmark text, becoming a virtual bible forthe numerous electricians who read it.On February 28, Tesla arrived in St. Louis, invited to speak by James I. Ayer,general manager of the local Municipal Electric Light & Power Company. Thearrival of the inventor created a jolt of excitement. His speech was billed as areplication of the London Lecture. “Over four thousand copies of the journalcontaining [a] biographical sketch were sold upon the streets…somethingunprecedented in the history of electrical journalism.”3 A procession of eightyelectrical utility wagons and metermen carts rolled down Main Street asthousands of people clamored to get tickets for the performance.4At the opening ceremony, both Tesla and Ayer were inducted into the associationas honorary members;5 afterward, Ayer introduced Tesla to one of his engineers,H. P. Broughton, a recent graduate of Cornell University, who was assigned as anassistant for the duration of the convention.6The chamber allocated proved to be too small, so the event was moved to theGrand Music Entertainment Hall, a large auditorium with a seating capacity ofover four thousand. Tickets were hawked on the steps for anywhere from three tofive dollars. Yet even this theater proved to be inadequate, for the house was“crowded to suffocation.”7Mr. Ayer introduced the inventor to the audience “with a sort of reverence asone who has an almost magic power over the vast hidden secrets of nature” andpresented Tesla with “a magnificent floral shield, wrought in white carnationsand red Beauty roses.”Peering out at the sea of faces, Tesla realized that it would be wise torestrict his lecture to the more “spectacular” experiments. With Broughton, hedisplayed his invention of wireless transmission of electrical energy bylighting up wireless receiving tubes by throwing a switch from the opposite sideof the room.“Of all the many marvelous things we observe,” he said, “to me it seems, avacuum tube excited by an electric impulse from a distant source, bursting forthout of the darkness and illuminating the room with its beautiful light, is aslovely a phenomenon as can greet our eyes.”8“By way of amusement,” Tesla created sheets of electricity between two condenserplates. He illuminated lightbulbs with and without filaments, ignitedphosphorescent globes that “threw a most dazzling light far beyond that yieldedby any ordinary phosphorescence,” and created strobe effects by whirling tubesthat “look[ed] like white spokes of a wheel of glowing moonbeams.”Tesla then approached his most powerful coil.Noticing Prof. George Forbes in the audience, the engineer from Glasgow who hadso highly recommended his AC system to the Niagara Power Commission, theinventor bowed in respect. Acknowledging his appreciation, Tesla predicted thatere long great surges of electrical energy based on this work would soon usherfrom the great waterfall.> These next series of experiments are shown with some reluctance; yet forced> thereto by the desire to gratify those who had shown such interest and formed> so large an audience, I see I have little choice…Charg[ing] my body with> electricity from an apparatus which I have devised, I can make the electricity> vibrate at the rate of a million times a second.

The appreciation> I have received from such a distinguished scientist as he has repaid me fully> for the pains to which I have worked to achieve these ends.10Tesla thereupon turned to the coil and announced that due to the enormouspotentials about to be generated, he had constructed the machine with hardrubber insulation, “as even dry wood is by far too poor” for protection.11> I now approach the free terminal with a metallic object held in my hand, this> simply to avoid burns. The sparks cease when the metal…touches the wire. My> arm is now traversed by a powerful electric current, vibrating at about a> million times a second.

So great is this agitation of the> particles, that when the lights are turned out you may see streams of feeble> light appear on some parts of my body. When such a streamer breaks out, it> produces a sensation like the pricking of a needle. Were the potentials> sufficiently high and the frequency low, the skin would probably be ruptured> under the tremendous strain, and the blood would rush out with great force in> the form of a fine spray.12Extending his fingers like a preening peacock, the electric sorcerer issuedflames of lightning as if he were Thor himself. “The streamers offer noparticular inconvenience,” he assured the audience, “except that in the ends ofthe finger tips a burning sensation is felt.”With his coil still charged and flames still shooting from his head, a number ofother effects were displayed, including the running of motors by way of energythrough his body and the lighting of a variety of colorful tubes which theinventor waved about as if they were phosphorescent rapiers. His finale includedthe stretching of a series of long cotton strings across the stage which hezapped with a pencil-line corona of violet that etched a dazzling glow along itslength, illuminating the stage in an eerie iridescence. Shouts of “Bravo”accompanied the thunderous applause as “the lecturer bowed again and again” inresponse.Shimmering from aftereffects and still “emitting ethereal flames and fine halosof splintered light”13 after the lecture, Tesla was called to the lobby so thathe could be greeted by many members of the admiring public. “So great was thedesire…to see Mr. Tesla closer…[that] several hundreds of the leading citizensseized the opportunity and Mr. Tesla’s hand in a very vigorous manner.”14Upon his return to New York, Tesla completed his citizenship requirements. Nolonger would his patent applications refer to him as “a subject of the Emperorof Austria,” but rather as “a citizen of the United States.” This was a proudmoment. He would keep these papers safely stored away in a vault in his room forthe rest of his life.Now a full “American,” Tesla decided once and for all to take on the mighty iconThomas Edison. Setting up one of his most provocative experiments, the upstartattacked head-on Edison’s carbon filament lamp. Taking two identical bulbs, onefilled with air and the other containing a vacuum, and attaching to it “acurrent vibrating about one million times a second,” Tesla demonstrated that thelamp filled with ordinary air did not glow but the one with the vacuum glowedbrightly. “This showed the great importance of the rarefied gas in the heatingof the conductor”; and furthermore, the new light was cool to the touch.Brazenly, Tesla could conclude: “In incandescent lighting, a high resistancefilament [Edison’s invention] does not at all constitute the really essentialelement of illumination.”15Taking the same two bulbs, Tesla then lowered the frequency, converted it to DC,and showed that the filament in the nonexhausted bulb now began to glow, thoughnot as intensely as the other. He concluded that with DC the filament was theessential component; with high-frequency AC, the atmosphere around the filament,and thus the vacuum, was paramount. The higher the frequency, the more efficientthe illuminant. In fact, he noted, if DC were abandoned altogether and extremelyhigh frequencies used, there would be no need for a filament at all!Edison became perturbed not only because he had sent men to the Orient, CentralAmerica, and the Amazon in order to find the perfect filament but also becauseone or two of them died in the quest.16 That pompous Serb was not only sayingthat AC was intrinsic to the development of any practical lighting system; hewas also proclaiming that Edison’s most famous work would eventually be fornaught.At a cottage by Edison’s rock-crushing factory in Ogden, New Jersey, a localnewspaper reporter asked the inventor about the “possibility of producing lightfrom electricity without heat.”17 Edison murmured that this feat had beenachieved, but the reporter pressed him. “I specifically mean with reference todiscoveries in the line taken up by Nikola Tesla.”Edison “rose from his easy chair,” spat another wad of tobacco off the porch,and barked, “It is a problem surrounded by difficulties.”“And what about Tesla?”“He has made no new discovery,” the chief wizard began, “but has shownconsiderable ingenuity in increasing vibrations. He gets his results from theinduction coil and the Geissler tube.”“Do you think it will replace your light bulb?”“Light without heat may be obtained some day, but I do not care to prophesy thatit will be a pleasant light. Its biggest trouble is its quality. It is a ghastlycolor, more like the light of lightning bugs than anything else.”Certainly, in this regard, Edison was entirely correct, as even today thelightbulb generates a more pleasant glow than fluorescent tubes. However, asanyone who has changed a lightbulb knows, Edison’s invention is constructed soas to break down within a few months, whereas Teslaic fluorescent lights canlast for years, even decades. Furthermore, according to Tesla’s view, theincandescent lamp created a harsh, bright light from a small central source. Itwas Tesla’s plan to create a pleasing light from a very large, sphericalsurface.Now, for the first time, Nikola Tesla was sought after by the popular press.Quoted as being “modest” by many interviewers and sometimes selfeffacing,initially Tesla avoided publicity. But his sensational accomplishments had madehim a folk hero, and it was now up to the journalists to find out why.The New York Herald was “the first” newspaper to capitalize on the rising star.In a long feature article adorned with an etching drawn from an outdatedphotograph, the Herald described the inventor’s demeanor and his heritage anddiscussed the full range of his future plans.“Mr. Tesla is such a hard worker that he has little time for social pleasures,if indeed he has any taste in that direction. He is a bachelor, tall, very spareof build, has dark, deep-set eyes, jet black hair and an expression thatsuggests at once the deep thinker. Though polite and even friendly to newspapermen, he has no desire to exploit himself in print.”Tesla described his parents and schooling, his invention of the rotatingmagnetic field, and also his new system of lighting, which he promised would be“a more practical illuminant than we have at present.” He discussed thepossibility of sending vast amounts of electricity along wires from NiagaraFalls and also the concept of wireless transmission of intelligence and powerthrough the earth and air “to any distance.”“From present experimental evidence it can be quite safely concluded that anattempt to transmit intelligible sounds through the earth from here, forinstance, to the European continent without any cable will succeed beyond adoubt…Such a result…which I have advocated for two years…if achieved, would, ofcourse, be of incalculable value to the world and greatly advance the progressof the human race.”The Herald ended with a question about how it felt to send hundreds of thousandsof volts through the body, and Tesla replied, “If you are prepared [for theshock] the effect on the nerves is not nearly as great. Initially, you feel aburn, but beyond that the feeling is scarcely noticeable. I have receivedcurrents as high as 300,000 volts, an amount which, if received in any otherway, would instantly kill.”18Although the travel and the lectures were digressions, Tesla accepted theengagements to solidify his place in the history of electrical science. For thecloistered conceptualist, naturally, the accolades and interaction withcolleagues were also inducements. However, it was only now, as he was beingsought after by reporters and the adoring public, that he began to realize, in aconscious sense, his latent desire for recognition. Every hour, every moment,that was not spent working on inventions was time away from his purpose. Eventhe intervals spent eating and sleeping delayed progress.Although both his parents had passed away at relatively young ages, there wereother kin whose life span had traversed more than ten decades. Perhaps in partas a defense, Tesla would exclaim that he expected to attain centenarian status.He had come to see the human body in its essence as a machine, one that could beefficiently regulated by the stern application of willpower, and so Teslaexerted his will to reduce his sleeping to a minimum and his eating to the barenecessities. Although over six feet tall, he kept his weight to a scant andunvarying 142 pounds.19 The strain was beginning to show, but the Serb was on aquest; his goal was nothing short of saving the whole of humanity through theapplication of his fertile brain.Having transmitted energy by means of wireless from one end of a room toanother, the inventor’s next task was to devise a way to extend this principleto generate larger amounts of power and to create separate, noninterferingchannels. Tesla began to experiment with more and more powerful oscillators,ones that would not only radiate high-frequency AC but also ones capable ofengendering physical pulsations.“The first gratifying result was obtained in the spring…when I reached tensionsof about 1,000,000 volts with my conical coil. That was not much in the light ofthe present art,” Tesla wrote a quarter of a century later, “but it was thenconsidered a feat.”20According to calculations performed by Professor John Tyndall, the Edisonelectric lightbulb had an efficiency of about 5 percent, meaning that 95 percentof the electricity produced went into the production of heat or was simply lostin transit. The gas flame, which was still by far the most common form ofartificial luminescence, had an efficiency of “less than one percent.” As Teslatold Martin, if “we were dealing with a corrupt government, such wretched wastewould not be tolerated.” This squander was “on a par with the wanton destructionof whole forests for the sake of a few sticks of lumber.”“The energy,” as Martin wrote, “is more or less frittered away, just as in Julythe load in an iceman’s cart crumbles and melts…along the street.” Whereas“armies of inventors had flung themselves on the difficulties involved in thesebarbaric losses occurring at every stage,” Tesla had designed an entirelyoriginal series of inventions which either converted electricity to rotaryaction or practically the reverse, that is, converted steam power intoelectrical energy.21In the first instance, Tesla constructed a high-frequency oscillator which wasimmersed in a vat of oil. By modulating the frequency of an AC, he caused theoil to flow at varying rates. Just like a waterwheel turning a turbine, this oilcaused a blade to rotate. By increasing the frequency, the flow would change,and the rotation of the turbine would be increased.In the second instance, that is, in the case of the steam generator, Teslacombined into one invention both an engine and a dynamo and created a devicethat was as much as one-fortieth the size of comparable traditionalconstructions. In the old-fashioned steam engine, the reciprocatingback-and-forth piston action had to be converted to a rotary effect by way of acrankshaft and flywheel. This device, in turn, was connected to a turbine, whichthereby produced electricity. In the Tesla generator, a steam driven pistonattached to a condenser was made to bob up and down within a magnetic field,cutting the lines of force, thereby producing a current. This procedure reducedmarkedly the loss involved in converting mechanical action to electrical power.There was no flywheel or crankshaft. Martin eloquently wrote: “We noteimmediately the absence of all the governing appliances of the ordinary engine.They are non-existent. The steam chest is the engine, bared to the skin like aprize-fighter with every ounce counting…Denuded in this way of superfluousweight, and driven at high pressure, the engine must have an economy far beyondthe common. With an absence of friction due to the automatic cushioning of thelight working parts, it is also practically indestructible. Furthermore, whereasthe ordinary steam piston, “weighing, perhaps as much as a thousand pounds,”could only change its direction, say, ten times per second, the Tesla oscillatorcould oscillate at “one hundred strokes a second.” Tesla hoped not only toreduce the complexity of existing equipment but also to create a current thatwould “maintain a vibration with perfect constancy.” He took out patents on bothof these devices in the summer.22With these various oscillators, Tesla could provide a plethora of effects.Electrically, he could generate precise frequencies that could be used totransmit information or electrical energy. When the oscillator was pulsating atthe frequency of light, he could manifest luminescence as well. And mechanicallyhe could create pulsations through metal bars, or pipes, and test for harmonicfrequencies and standing waves. By studying impedance phenomena, he couldtransmit electromagnetic energy through such a conduit and cause a light toilluminate at certain positions along its length but not at others, and if heincreased the vibrations and struck a harmonic frequency, he could get the ironrod to begin to vibrate with such intensity that it would crack itself in two.This effect was equivalent to that produced by Joshua’s horns at Jericho or tothe danger that could be initiated by soldiers marching in lockstep across asuspension bridge. If their beat struck the resonant frequency, the bridge couldsway violently and possibly collapse. Thus, soldiers are trained to break stridewhile walking across bridges to avoid this amazing type of catastrophe.> THE WORLD’S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION> > The Scene by Night> > Inadequate as words have been found to convey a realizing idea of the beauty> and grandeur of the spectacle which the Exposition offers by day, they are> infinitely less capable of affording the slightest conception of the dazzling> spectacle which greets the eye of the visitor by night…> > Indescribable by language are the electric fountains.

E. Cameron23On May 1, the Chicago World’s Fair, or Columbian Exposition, opened. Thisauspicious occasion came at a paradoxical time for the country, for on the onehand, the United States had announced that it was the new leader in the creationand deployment of new technology; on the other hand, it was embroiled in thePanic of 1893. Simultaneously, and for one exceptional time, the world at largewas experiencing universal peace.The Columbian Exposition covered almost seven hundred acres, had sixty thousandexhibitors and cost $25 million. With 28 million attendees, the Chicago Fairboasted a $2.25 million profit. Whereas the Paris Exposition of 1889 had thestupendous 984-foot tall Eiffel Tower, the Chicago Fair boasted the Ferriswheel. Revolving on the largest one-piece axle ever forged, the wheel stood 264feet high and had a seating capacity of over two thousand.24Every day, hundreds of thousands of visitors from every corner of the globestreamed into Chicago’s “White City.” The chief architect, Chicagoan DanielHudson Burnham, along with the other planners, based their design on a city ofwaterways, much like Venice, with a “Court of Honor” centrally placed to housethe major “palaces.” With wooden façades made to resemble marble, the buildingsrivaled even the great stone achievements of the ancient Romans and Greeks. TheManufacturers & Liberal Arts Pavilion, more than twice the size of the others,was “by far, the largest building in the world.” Nearly a third of a mile longand well over two football fields wide, the structure covered 30.5 acres and hada seating capacity of seventy-five thousand.Abutting Lake Michigan, at the far end above the Court of Honor, with columnsextended like the arms of a mighty conductor, was the magnificent Arch andPeristyle. Designed by head sculptor August Saint-Gaudens, this statue depicteda general, representing Christopher Columbus, thunderously entering the fairwith his mighty team of horses. Beneath this quadriga was the great, gildedsixty-five-foot Statue of the Republic, which rose from the main canal like abenevolent behemoth as it blessed not only the Manufacturer’s Pavilion but alsopalaces for agriculture (designed by Stanford White), machinery, administration,and electricity.And that was just the Court of Honor.Running perpendicular to the “great quadrangle” for nearly a mile was yetanother opulently lined moat containing most of the other large-scale pavilionsand displays described in one text as “a cacophonous confusion of advancedcultures, converted heathens, peculiar tongues, and queer importations.”25 Witha fleet of fifty gondolas driven by brand-new electrical engines, visitors couldmotor to any pavilion they wanted.The Electricity Pavilion, adorned with a dozen elegant minarets, four of whichrose 169 feet above the hall, was over two football fields in length and nearlyhalf that measure in width. Covering three and one-half acres, this “spaciousand stately” structure “befit[ted] the seat of the most novel and brilliantexhibit of the Columbian Exposition.”The ex-governor of the state of Illinois, William E. Cameron, described thepalace as housing the “magical achievements of Mr. Edison and his brotherwizards.”26 Containing the names of the forefathers of the science above aformidable statue of Benjamin Franklin launching his kite at the main vestibule,Electricity Hall presented a fascinating potpourri of advanced technologies.Foremost among the exhibitors were the megalithic corporations, such asWestinghouse and GE, from America, and the more modest sized AEG, from Germany.Whereas AEG reproduced some of the AC equipment Brown and Dobrowolsky used intheir “epoch-making” 108-mile Lauffen-to-Frankfurt transmission, GE presentedits own AC system. Westinghouse, having won the bid to light the fair with theonly bona fide patents, was in an odd situation. Legally, it should have beenable to block the competitors from advertising pirated apparatus, butpragmaticaly, considering time limitations and other factors, such a tacticalaction was out of the question. In fact, in some ways, they owed AEG gratitudefor pointing the way. Their course was to make it clear that there was only oneinventor. And so they erected a forty-five-foot high monument in the centeraisle of Electricity Hall which proclaimed the truth to the world. Thetestimonial read in big bold letters: Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co.Tesla Polyphase System. And with this method, from an annex of Machinery Hall,Westinghouse illuminated the entire World’s Fair. Having manufactured a quarterof a million Sawyer-Mann stopper lamps for the occasion, Westinghouse generatedthree times more electrical energy than was then being utilized in the entirecity of Chicago.27Not to be eclipsed, GE constructed a scintillating eighty-two-foot high Tower ofLight in the exact center of Electricity Hall. It comprised eighteen thousandlamps running the full length of the pedestal, capped by a single enormousEdison lightbulb ignited at the apex.Other features within Electricity Hall included, on the second floor, electricalgadgets to cure all ills, such as charged belts, electrical hairbrushes, andbody invigorators, and on the main floor, displays by the most prominentinventors of the day. Elihu Thomson, for instance, unleashed a high-frequencycoil that created sparks five feet long; Alexander Graham Bell unveiled atelephone that could transmit voice via light beams; and Elisha Gray presentedhis teleautography machine, a precursor of today’s fax machine. For a few cents,it would reproduce a person’s signature electronically at a distance.Tom Edison presented his own cornucopia of gadgets, including the multiplextelegraph, the fantastic talking machine known as the phonograph, and hiskinetescope, which for the first time in a public forum displayed “the varyinglabile movements” of a human being in motion.Tesla’s exhibit, which occupied part of the Westinghouse space, featured anumber of his early AC devices, including motors, armatures, and generators,phosphorescent signs of noted electricians, such as Helmholtz, Faraday, Maxwell,Henry, and Franklin, and a sign for his favorite Serbian poet Jovan ZmajJovanovich. Tesla also displayed vacuum tubes illuminated by means of wirelesstransmission, his rotating egg of Columbus, sheets of crackling light created byhigh-frequency discharges between two insulated plates, and other neon signsreading Westinghouse, and Welcome Electricians. These last two displays“produc[ed] the effect of a modified lightning discharge…accompanied by asimilar deafening noise. This was probably one of the most novel attractions ina sensational way seen in the building, as the noise could be heard anywherewithin Electricity Building and the flash of the miniature lightning was verybrilliant and startling.”28Tesla traveled to Chicago in August not only to visit the fair and present aweek of demonstrations but also to attend the International Electrical Congressthat was held there for that month. “At Electricity Hall, Professor Teslaannounces he will send a current of 100,000 volts through his own body withoutinjury to life, an experiment which seems all the more wonderful when we recallthe fact that the currents made use of for executing murderers at Sing Sing,N.Y., have never exceeded 2,000 volts. Mr. Tesla also shows a number of otherinteresting experiments, some of which are so marvelous as to be almost beyonddescription.”29On August 25, Nikola Tesla spoke before “one thousand electrical engineers” atthe International Electrical Congress in Agriculture Hall. In attendance was a“galaxy of notables,” including Galileo Ferraris, Sir William Preece, SilvanusThompson, Elihu Thomson, and honorary chairman Hermann Ludwig von Helmholtz,whom Tesla also took on a tour of his personal exhibit.“People crowded about the doors and clamored for admittance…The great majorityof those who came, came with the expectation of seeing Tesla pass a current of250,000 volts through his body…Ten dollars was offered for a single seat, andoffered in vain. Only members of the Electrical Congress, with their wives, wereadmitted, and not even they unless they were provided with credentials.” Beforethe lecture, a Chicago reporter inquired of Professors William Preece andSilvanus Thompson as to the use of the various equipment scattered about thehall, but they “gazed in wonder and confessed they could not guess…They [simply]lumped off the whole lot under the generic term of ‘Tesla’s animals.’“Presently, white-haired Elisha Gray was seen escorting a tall, gaunt young mantowards the platform. The young man smiled with pleasure but modestly kept hiseyes on the floor. His cheeks were hollow, his black eyes sunken…but sparkingwith animation;…Intense and continuous application of his work has sapped hisenergy until his friends say he has almost reached the point of dissolution. Agentleman who dined with him a week ago says he could scarcely make himselfheard across the table, he was so worn out. He has glossy black hair parted inthe middle, a mustache, heavy under his aquiline nose, but fading to asuggestion at the sides of his mouth…his ears are large and stand out from hishead. He wore a neat four-button cutaway suit of brownish gray.” Gray said to arousing applause: “I give you the Wizard of Physics, Nikola Tesla.”“I have with great reluctance accepted these compliments, because I had no rightto interrupt the flow of speech of our chairman,” Tesla began withcharacteristic humor. Appearing somewhat like a resurrected cadaver, Tesla spoketo allay the fears of all those concerned for his frail health. “A number ofscientific men urged [a group of electricians] to deliver a lecture. A greatmany promised that they would come, [but] when the programme was sifted down Iwas the only healthy man left…and so I managed to take some of my apparatus…andgive you a brief outline of some of my work.”30Tesla proceeded to display his new steam generators and mechanical oscillators,some of which were so compact “that one could readily carry them in the crown ofone’s hat.” He told the audience that his goals were multifaceted. Such a devicecould, among other things, be used to run motors with perfect synchrony, orelectric clocks. He had also produced a continuous-wave radio transmitter,although no one at the time understood the complete ramifications of theequipment. Nevertheless, when the resonant frequency was reached, wirelesslights would again illuminate, and in that way intelligence was wirelesslytransmitted.One of Tesla’s more unusual exhibits, which was similar to his egg of Columbus,was another ring which displayed not only the principles of the rotatingmagnetic field but also his theory of planetary motion.> In this experiment one large and several small brass balls were usually> employed.

In engineering circles Tesla was known as“one of the most remarkable discoverers of the age,”2 to the magazines as(heaven forbid!) “the New Edison,”3 to the newspapers as “Our ForemostElectrician,”4 to the masses as a wondrous wizard from a strange land, and tothe financiers as bankable.Having recognized the virtuoso from the outset, T. C. Martin, as head trumpeter,was now helping choreograph Tesla’s vault into the public arena. Commerford, ashe was known to his friends, had generated a propitious relationship to allconcerned when he met with Robert Underwood Johnson, associate editor of theCentury, to propose a feature article on the thriving electronic savant.“Take a seat,” Johnson offered as he scanned through toppling stacks ofmanuscripts scattered about the office to find a chair that could be easilycleared. A brother of a congressman and a poet, Johnson had, in 1889, beenhonored by the city when he was chosen to contribute an original sonnet for theunveiling of the Washington Square arch which he read before President Harrisonand other dignitaries. A temporary structure designed by Standford Whitecommemorating one hundred years since the inauguration of George Washington,this arch predated by a few years the permanent marble Arch also designed byWhite. Johnson was also knowledgeable about inventors, having visited Edison’slaboratory in the early 1880s as a reporter for Scribner’s Monthly, theprecursor of the Century. Tesla, no doubt, had already piqued his interest.Impressed with the eloquent portrait Martin had painted of Tesla, Johnsoninvited his colleague over for dinner. “Why not bring the wizard along. Perhapsthere is more than one article here for the offing.”On a first-name basis with such personalities as mayoral candidate TheodoreRoosevelt and writer Mark Twain, two frequent visitors to his Union Squareoffice, Johnson and his ebullient wife, Katharine, were the very essence of thephrase “gracious hosts.” Through their dinner parties at their home at 327Lexington Avenue, a visitor could dine with any number of luminaries, such assculptor August Saint-Gaudens; actress Eleonora Duse; poet and editor in chiefof the Century, Richard Watson Gilder; naturalist John Muir; activist forchildren’s rights Mary Mapes Dodge; conductor of the Boston Symphony MonsieurGericke; composer and pianist Ignace Paderewski; thespian Joseph Jefferson; orwriter extraordinaire Rudyard Kipling. Johnson had just returned with his wifefrom their second trip to Europe, where they had, by chance, run into Twain inVenice. The world was a cozy and romantic place for the Johnsons, in partbecause they found it that way and in part because they molded it that way.5Martin arrived with a “pallid, drawn and haggard” Tesla at the Johnson home inthe middle of the Christmas season. They were greeted by Katharine and RobertJohnson and their two children, Agnes, who was about sixteen, and Owen, who wastwo or three years younger.The inventor’s frail condition, which one reporter described as having “reachedthe limits of human endurance,”6 took the Johnsons, especially Katharine, bysurprise. A facile conversationalist, Katharine was a striking woman of Irishdescent, poised, with shoulders swept back, her head held erect. Although herhair was now beginning to streak gray, she still exuded an air of youth. It washer eyes in particular that visitors were drawn to. Slightly coquettish, theydisplayed a daring sense of play beneath a wistful stare.Triggering a constellation of emotions ranging from maternal instincts tobeguilement, Katharine became enthralled, some would say mesmerized, by theSerbian superman who had entered her world; and he had taken to her.Tesla talked about his European tour, particularly his meeting with Sir WilliamCrookes, and the Johnsons invited him for Christmas.“You are overworked, Mr. Tesla, and you should take a holiday,” Katharinedeclared. “Perhaps a good Christmas meal will keep you going through the firstmonths of the new year.”“I get all the nourishment I require from my laboratory,” Tesla retorted. “Iknow I am completely worn out, and yet I cannot stop my work. These experimentsof mine are so important, so beautiful, so fascinating, that I can hardly tearmyself away from them to eat, and when I try to sleep I think about themconstantly. I expect I shall go on until I break down altogether. Come, let usgo there for our dessert.” A carriage was called, and in short order theJohnsons were lured to the “magician’s den.”7“Be prepared for a surprise or two,” Tesla said as he, in the words of areporter who experienced a similar episode, “ushered [them] into a room sometwenty five feet square, lighted on one side by two broad windows, partiallycovered by heavy black curtains. The laboratory was literally filled withcurious mechanical appliances of every description…Snakelike cables ran alongthe walls, ceiling, and floor. In the center was [an electric dynamo which satupon] a large circular table covered with thick strips of black woolen cloth.Two large brownish globes, eighteen inches in diameter, [were sus]pended from[the] ceiling by cords. Composed of brass, coated [and insulated with] wax,[these globes] served the purpose of spreading the electrostatic field…”Tesla shut the doors and drew the curtains “until every chink or crevice for theadmission of light was concealed and the laboratory bathed in absolutelyimpenetrable gloom. [As we] awaited developments, exquisitely beautiful luminoussigns and devices of mystic origin began to flash about. Sometimes they seemediridescent, the entire room filled with electric vibrations, [as] tubes [and]bulbs [which we held] became luminous…What impressed [us] most of all, perhaps,was the simple but cheerful fact that [we] remained unscathed, while electricalbombardments were taking place on every side.”8A few days later, in honor of the celebration of the Serbian Christmas, onJanuary 6, Katharine sent Tesla a bouquet.“I have to thank Mrs. Johnson for the magnificent flowers,” Tesla wrote Robert.“I have never…received flowers [before], and they produced upon me a curiouseffect.”9Tesla would return to the Johnson home on a regular basis, for dinner or afteran evening on his own for a late nightcap; and the inventor reciprocated bytaking the Johnsons out on the town. They would be attending the galaperformance of Dvořák’s New World Symphony.“Upon receipt of your first note,” Tesla wrote Robert, “I immediately securedthe best seats I could for Saturday. Nothing better than the 15th row! Verysorry, we shall have to use telescopes. But I think the better for Mrs.Johnson’s vivid imagination. Dinner at Delmonico’s.”10Intrigued with Tesla’s fascinating heritage, Robert became interested in Serbianpoetry, and so Tesla began to translate for him. They obtained permission fromZmaj Jovanovich to feature some of his poems for inclusion in the Century, andalso in a book Johnson entitled Songs of Liberty. Their favorite was undoubtedlythe ballad about a warrior from a Montenegrin battle which took place in 1874.> Luka Filipov> > One more hero to be part> Of the Servians’ glory!> > Lute to lute and heart to heart> Tell the homely story:> > Let the Moslem hide for shame,> Trembling like the falcon’s game,> Thinking on the falcon’s name—> Luka Filipov.The verse goes on to describe a fierce battle, in which Luka captures a pashaand marches him back to the prince. However, on the way, Luka becomes wounded inan ambush, so his soldiers decide to retaliate by killing the arrested Turk.> We’d have fired, but Luka’s hand> Rose in protestation,> > While his pistol’s mute command> needed no translation:> > For the Turk retraced his track,> Knelt, and took upon his back> (As a peddler lifts his pack)> Luka Filipov!> > > > How we cheered him as he passed> Through the line, a-swinging> > Gun and pistol—bleeding fast—> Grim—but loudly singing…> [But] as couriers came to say> > That our friends had won the day,> Who should up and faint away?> Luka Filipov!”One can easily envision Robert’s and Katharine’s eyes aglow as Teslaspontaneously translated Zmai’s ode in their living room one special evening andhow Robert worked to hone it for publication. From this moment on, brotherRobert would be known as “Dear Luka,” and Katharine would be addressed as “Mrs.Filipov.”To Katharine, Tesla was more than a man; he was an icon of historicalimportance, a trophy to display before her lady friends, and even more thanthis, he was a tangible symbol of intangible longings. In her essence, Katharinewas a frustrated artist whose ever-present yearnings pulled her from moments ofexaltation to the edge of despair. She must have been a difficult person to livewith, but like Tesla, she had the capability to spark that realm that makes lifeall the more worth living. Selfish, egocentric, and histrionic at times,Katharine also had a dominant streak that not only pulled people to her butmanipulated them to her needs. Even the elusive hermit became a fly in her web.“Dear Mr. Tesla,” she wrote in January 1894, ‘We have had a hospital here sinceThursday. Robert and Agnes the invalids. Robert is better but not out, and wewant you to come…this evening and brighten us up…As a great favor come…to usimmediately.”12This beckoning to her auxiliary mate became a recurrent theme that replayeditself again and again through the next many years. For instance, in 1896 shewrote, “Dear Mr. Tesla, I shall expect to see you tomorrow evening”;13 in 1897,“Come soon”;14 and in 1898, “Will you come to see me tomorrow evening and willyou try to come a little early…I want very much to see you and will be reallydisappointed if you do not think my request worthy [of] your consideration.”15But Katharine was not alone in her infatuation; T. C. Martin had discovered him,but Robert would soon become Tesla’s closest confidant. A triad of intimacyquickly transpired as Commerford Martin’s hold on the inventor began to loosen.And just as much as the Johnsons would come to cherish Tesla, he would cherishthem. Here was a loving family the isolate could bind to.Tesla’s health constantly was an issue not only for their own concerns but also,for the good of the species. Martin, whose new article in the Century, wouldcertainly serve to advance his own career as well as Tesla’s, was just assolicitous, and he discussed the precariousness of the situation with Katharine.“I do not believe…that he will give up work at any very early date,” Martinwrote. “Talking of California with him in a casual way elicited the fact that hehad a couple of invitations to lecture there so that I don’t want to jam hishead into that lion’s mouth. I believe he is going to take more care of himselfand you may have done us all a great deal of service by your timely words. Yetin spite of that,” Martin continued, “I fear he will go on in the delusion thatwoman is generically a Delilah who would shear him of his locks. If you canmanage it, I believe it would be a good scheme to have that Doctor get hold ofhim…My prescription is a weekly lecture from Mrs. RUJ.”16 This passage, by aTesla colleague, is a rare glimpse at one of the enduring mysteries about Tesla,namely his supposed celibacy and mysterious sexual inclinations.By coincidence, only a fortnight later, Heinrich Hertz was dead. He was onlythirty-six. Martin wrote to Tesla, “For God’s sake, let it be a warning to you.All Europe mourns for such an untimely taking off.”17But Tesla would take no heed, and his custom of driving himself to the limitwould be a style of living that he would continue for many years. The future ofthe race and his role in it was clear to him; nothing could stand in his way.“The time will come,” Tesla told Katharine, “when crossing the ocean by steameryou will be able to have a daily newspaper on board with the important news ofthe world, and when by means of a pocket instrument and a wire stuck in theground, you can communicate from any distance with friends at home through aninstrument similarly attuned.”18 His gaze and seeming powers of divination tookher breath away. Penetrating his inner sanctum only added to her captivation.At the outset, Tesla’s unparalleled achievements, explosion into internationalstardom, and promise for the future generated an express desire for all to cashin, to sell his multitudinous array of inventions so that they could ascendtogether to the next social rung. Their goal was to become millionaires. Tesla’s“cold light” appeared to be the first ticket.As Martin’s erudite biographical essay had received words of praise even fromcompetitors, Johnson suggested that they plan a second piece, one that featuredthe lab. Johnson would get some of his more famous friends to come, and photoswould be taken. This would be an exclusive, the first ever with the newrevolutionary cold light. Johnson writes:> We were frequently invited to witness his experiments, which included…the> production of electrical vibrations of an intensity not before achieved.> Lightning-like flashes of the length of fifteen feet were an every-day> occurrence, and his tubes of electric light were used to make photographs of> many of his friends as souvenir of their visits. He was the first person to> make use of phosphorescent light for photographic purposes—not a small item of> invention in itself. I was one of a group consisting of Mark Twain, Joseph> Jefferson, Marion Crawford and others who had the unique experience of being> thus photographed.19Naturally, the Twain pictures would become the centerpiece.

Clemens, as hesigned his letters to Tesla, came to the laboratory on March 4, 1894, and againon April 26.20 Twain wrote to postpone the initial meeting for one day, andTesla and Johnson exchanged notes about it. Curiously, Twain’s private log forthis period makes no reference to the occasion. He had dined with Stanford Whiteat his Madison Square Garden tower in January and, the following month, hadreceived a notice that $160,000 in royalties were coming his way because of thePaige typesetting machine which he had backed, but that was all he jotted down,even though Twain had been aware of Tesla from the very first moment that theinventor had gone public with his creation of the AC polyphase system.21 Back inNovember 1888, Twain had written: “I have just seen the drawings & descriptionof an electrical machine lately patented by a Mr. Tesla, & sold to theWestinghouse Company, which will revolutionize the whole electric business ofthe world. It is the most valuable patent since the telephone.”22Twain had run into Tesla on occasion, at the Players’ Club or Delmonico’s, or atthe artist Robert Reid’s studio. One night, in Twain’s words, “the world-wideillustrious electrician” had joined the Reid party. Jokes and stories wereswapped, and songs were sung, particularly Kipling’s “On the Road toMandalay.”23 Tesla related the story of how Twain’s books saved his life when hewas a boy of twelve struck down with a case of malaria, and this tale served toendear Tesla to Twain to the point of bringing tears to the writer’s eyes.24Interested in inventions and their exploitation, Twain asked Tesla at the lab ifit would be all right if he could sell high-frequency electrotherapy machines torich widows in Europe upon his next sojourn; the inventor naturally agreed.Tesla, in turn, showed the great writer yet another creation which he claimedwould help these widows digest their meals.This contraption, he explained, “consists of a platform supported on elasticcushions that are made to oscillate by means of compressed air. One day, Istepped on the platform and the vibrations imparted were transmitted to mybody…Evidently, these isochronous rapid oscillations stimulated powerfully theperistaltic movements which propel the food-stuffs through the alimentarychannels.”“You mean, it’ll make me regular?” Twain inquired.“Precisely, and without the use of elixirs, specific remedies or internalapplications whatever.”Without further ado, Twain stepped aboard as Tesla tried to stop his assistantsfrom chuckling. As Twain had been so enthusiastic, Tesla neglected to inform himthat peristaltic action is induced almost immediately.“Suddenly, Twain felt an unspeakable and pressing necessity which had to bepromptly satisfied,” Tesla told the Johnsons the next day to their tearful glee,for he had to jump off the platform and find his way swiftly to the lavatory.“I think I’ll start with the electrotherapy machines,” Twain said upon hisreturn. “Wouldn’t want the widows to get too healthy all at one shot.”25The photos of Twain and the others were processed nearly one full year beforethey would appear in print. Tesla was elated and commented to Johnson that theone of Joseph Jefferson was “simply immense. I mean the one showing him alone inthe darkness. I think it is a [work] of art.”26 Katharine suggested that theyall celebrate at Delmonico’s and that he then join them for a summer holiday atthe Hamptons. Tesla wrote back: “I fear that if I depart very often from mysimple habits I shall come to grief.” However, realizing that he would soon bemissing “the pleasure of your company” he reluctantly agreed to go to dinner,but not to the holiday, and therefore signed off, “In the anticipation of thejoy [of dining with friends] and subsequent sorrows, I remain, Yours sincerely,N. Tesla.”27Concerning the photographs, which were the first ever taken with phosphorescentlights, Tesla, who had his eye on potential investors, became impatient for thepublicity; but Martin and Johnson were aghast.“I think that we ought to have a little talk about giving to the dailynewspapers a hint that Mr. Tesla has succeeded in taking photos byphosphorescence,” Martin warned. “It will leak out some hour and thensomeone…with the customary arrogance [will place it] in the papers…[We need] toget our priorities established. I think R. U. Johnson feels the same way.”28This became the beginning of a series of disagreements between the inventor andhis editor. The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla was now inpress, and Martin and Tesla were making money from the sale of the book;however, Tesla kept wanting to give copies away freely. He sent the text to eachof his uncles and his three sisters in Bosnia/Croatia and also mailed hisarticle on Zmai to his uncle Pajo and his sister Marica.29Martin had to tread carefully, for although he was unhappy with Tesla’s lack ofconcern for the financial side of the situation, he also in no way wanted toalienate himself from the wellspring. Martin wrote, “Your request [for more freecopies] is just too hard. It seems to me that the Pittsburgh boys, if they loveyou, ought to be willing to blow a little money of their own on the book. Butyou are the best judge of relations to them.” Martin promised to send Tesla adozen copies at reduced prices. “Perhaps,” Martin requested, “you would like tomake us a bid on the whole edition,” closing as follows: “When you write me,make it autographic as often as you can. People are beginning to deplete mystock.”30From Tesla’s point of view, it was his book, and Martin should simply do as heasked. This would become a sore point, especially because Martin would come tolend Tesla money based on profits that were due him as editor and Tesla wouldnever repay him.31 Martin would overlook it, for now.After the first photographs arrived, including the discreetly stylized engravingof Tesla based on his most recent portrait, Martin requested a sneak preview. “Iwill lock [them] up or put [them] in a safe deposit vault, if you wish, untilthe hour of publication,” promised Martin. “But I want to get one of the firstas an historical souvenir.” At the same time, Martin informed Johnson that theUniversity of Nebraska had offered Tesla an honorary doctorate in celebration oftheir twenty-fifth anniversary. “I have urged him to accept. I want you and Mrs.Johnson to bring your influence on him also. Her spell is now a potent one, Ifancy, with him, so far as any woman’s can be, next [to] his sisters.”32It is unlikely, however, that Tesla thought much about getting a doctorate fromthe obscure University of Nebraska. To a person of his background and education,the offer was virtually meaningless. Johnson thought it more appropriate for aprestigious institution, such as Columbia College, to grant such an honor. Teslahad just received the Elliott Cresson Gold Medal Award from the FranklinInstitute for “his earnest and indefatigable work as a pioneer in this field,and on account of the great value to science of his researches.”33 However, thiswas not the same as a doctorate, and so Johnson wrote to Hewey Fairfield Osborn,one of the dignitaries at Columbia, urging that they make the offer instead.> Johnson wrote:> > > > There would be a particular appropriateness in Columbia giving him a degree,> since his first lecture was, if I mistake not, delivered at the College and> since New York City is the scene of his most important discoveries…I think it> may truly be said that there are few men occupying this unique position…in> both the theoretical and practical phases of scientific work…As to his general> culture, I may say that he…is widely read in the best literature of Italy,> Germany and France as well as much of the Slavic countries to say nothing of> Greek and Latin. He is particularly fond of poetry and is always quoting> Leopardi…or Goethe or the Hungarians or Russians. I know of few men of such> diversity of general culture or such accuracy of knowledge.Johnson ended the letter with a character reference. His personality, he said,“is one of distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosityand force.”34Since Professor Osborn knew Tesla well and had been witness to the Columbialecture, he concurred with Johnson and thereupon spoke to Seth Low, thepresident of the university. “Poulton tells me,” Osborn said, “that Tesla wascovered with honors while in England and France. We certainly must not allow anyother university to anticipate us in honoring a man who lives under our veryeyes.”“Isn’t he a countryman of Pupin’s?” Low inquired.“Yes, of course. It was at the urging of Professor Pupin and Professor Crockerthat Tesla spoke here to begin with.”“Didn’t they have a row between them?” the president responded cautiously.“I have learned confidentially that there has sprung up some slight differencebetween them, but I’m sure it will probably be healed. In any event, there seemslittle doubt that Tesla is the leading electrician in the country.”35Within a few weeks, the inventor was given an honorary doctorate from Columbia,and shortly thereafter he received a similar honor from Yale.Having received professional recognition among his peers, Tesla had arrived.Feature articles were appearing in prestigious periodicals, and he washobnobbing with the most esteemed literary and social figures of the day."},{"pageContent":"14NIAGARA POWER (1894) [002-toc.html#ch14]> How extraordinary was my life an incident may illustrate…[As a youth] I was> fascinated by a description of Niagara Falls I had perused, and pictured in my> imagination a big wheel run by the Falls.

It hinged on very specific factors.The first serious scheme to harness the mighty cataract, the Evershed plan, wasproposed in 1886. Thomas Evershed, a civil engineer, who had worked on the ErieCanal, had conceived the idea of the creation of a complex network of canals andtunnels running adjacent to the Falls, whereby two hundred waterwheels andaccompanying industrial mills would be placed. He had probably ruminated overthe scheme for twoscore years, as Evershed had worked as a surveyor at Niagarain his youth as far back as the 1840s. Although the idea was attractive, it wascostly and dangerous to implement, as most of the nine miles of excavationrequired for the canals and wheel pits had to be done by blasting through stone;estimates ran as high as $10 million. Thus, the officials of the CataractConstruction Company sought counsel from notable engineers and inventors.2In 1889, Edison submitted a plan which boldly asserted that DC could betransmitted to Buffalo, approximately twenty miles away. As appreciable amountsof DC electricity had never traversed a distance in excess of one or two miles,this suggestion appeared highly optimistic, and it was doubted by most otherengineers, particularly Sprague and Kennelly, two of Edison’s coworkers.Westinghouse was also dubious of the feasibility of transmitting electricalenergy, and he suggested the implementation of a sophisticated system of cablesand compressed air tubes to transfer the power to Buffalo.3 Thus, for thesereasons, plans for harnesing the falls centered for the most part onconstructing an industrial complex adjacent to the falls.The long-distance transmission of electrical power was simply beyond imagining.It must be remembered that what Edison generated was meager amounts ofelectricity capable of illuminating lightbulbs, and then only in close proximityto the source of the power. Since his DC apparatus still made use of acommutator, he was incapable of transmitting appreciable amounts of power,although he could run a few motors if they were close to the generator. That iswhy the 1891 Lauffen-Frankfurt transmission was so startling. Brown andDobrowolsky had not only surpassed, by a factor of about one hundred, Edison’slong-distance record; they had also transmitted significant amounts of power, aspectacular achievement with no comparable precedent.Brown and Dobrowolsky had had predecessors. Two years earlier, Sebastian Zianide Ferranti, the son of an Italian musician living in Liverpool, England, hadbeen the first to use Tesla’s apparatus at a plant at Depford. Ferranti, abrilliant engineer with talents purported to have rivaled Edison’s, had alreadymade important modifications on the Gaulard-Gibbs AC apparatus for SiemensBrothers and also Ganz & Company at their London branch. His bold idea was tocreate a central station along the Thames so that electricity could be pumped tonumerous substations around town.4 In 1889, from Depford, Ferranti transmittedan unprecedented 11,000 volts to four substations of six to seven miles away,where 10,000 horsepower alternators were driven.5 This was a magnificentaccomplishment, but it appears doubtful that many people understood that it wasTesla’s system6 or even that true success had been achieved. In no way did itgain the publicity of the Lauffen-Frankfurt enterprise, nor did it spark theidea of spreading the energy of Niagara Falls beyond its surrounding area.Nor had Westinghouse’s initial achievements in electrical power transmissiondemonstrated the capabilities of the Tesla system. He had succeeded atTelluride, Colorado, with Stillwell, Shallenberger, and Scott, in transmitting60,000 volts of AC for a distance of four miles to run a 100 horsepower Teslamotor, and he had illuminated the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893. Both of thesewere great triumphs, but neither demonstrated that electrical power could betransmitted over long distances. In short, without the Lauffen-Frankfurtsuccess, there would have been no proof that AC was capable of traversing thetwenty miles from Niagara to Buffalo, let alone from Niagara to New York City,which was over three hundred miles away. That is why the financial backers ofthe Niagara project sent Edward Dean Adams, president of the CataractConstruction Company, to Europe to confer with Brown and Dobrowolsky, and thatis why Dobrowolsky intimated that the invention was his. There was no physicalproof to the contrary, as clearly he and Brown had been the first and onlyengineers to realize such a feat.Adams, from the firm Winslow, Lanier & Company, out of Boston, was a slight,gentle-looking man with large round eyes, small head, the face of a teenager,and a mammoth handlebar mustache. He began his relationship with longtime J. P.Morgan associate Charles Lanier in 1881. Working his way up to full partner,Adams was placed on the board of directors of a number of major railroads,including Henry Villard’s Northern Pacific, and also the Ontario and WesternRailroad, with lines stemming from Buffalo to New York City.7 He also sat on theboard of directors of the Edison Electric Light Company, as its second largeststockholder.In 1889, along with Villard, who was attempting to combine all the majorelectric companies into one large corporation, Adams tried to curtail the highlyexpensive lightbulb patent dispute between Edison and Westinghouse by gettingthem to confer with one another, but, of course, Edison wanted no part of suchan arrangement.8As president of the Cataract Construction Company, Adams sold his shares in theEdison concern so that he could be impartial in his investigations, and in 1890he “established the International Niagara Commission, with headquarters inLondon…His intention was to consult with leading European scientists andengineers and to examine the most advanced hydraulic-power [compressed air]techniques, a branch of engineering in which Switzerland excelled.”9In 1890, Adams traveled to Europe with Dr. Coleman Sellers, another executive ofthe Cataract Construction Company, where they conferred with engineers inFrance, Switzerland, and England. In London they visited Ferranti at hiselectrical station at Depford; they also met with Professor Rowland, who hadtraveled from Johns Hopkins University, and Gisbert Kapp, electrical engineeringeditor and author of the classic text Electrical Transmission of Energy. Rowlandargued in favor of AC, and Kapp recommended C. E. L. Brown as the most prominentengineer to undertake the project. He was located at the MaschinenfabrinOerlikon Works in Switzerland. Adams wired J. Pierpont Morgan, who was in Paris,with the suggestion that he return to Switzerland to meet with Brown. Morganconcurred.10Before leaving England, Adams met with Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), whomhe placed in charge of the International Niagara Commission, and a contest wascreated awarding cash prizes totaling $20,000 for the best plans submitted forharnessing the falls. L. B. Stillwell, who was in London with H. H. Byllesby, atthe Westinghouse branch, wired to Pittsburgh to request permission to compete bygiving Adams a plan based on the Tesla system; but Westinghouse turned down theidea because he did not want to give away $100,000 worth of advice for such apaltry sum.Of the twenty proposals submitted, most involved compressed air and hydraulicequipment. “Of the six electrical plans, four used direct current…[one] proposedsingle phase [AC], but ‘details were not fully described.’ The remaining plan byProf. George Forbes advocated polyphase installation.”11 Forbes, who was aprofessor from Glasgow and who was later hired as consulting engineer to theNiagara Power Company, wrote to the commission: “It will be somewhat startlingto many, as I confess it was at first to myself, to find as the result of athorough and impartial examination of the problem that the only practicalsolution lies in the adoption of alternating current generators and motors…Theonly [workable one] is the Tesla motor manufactured by the Westinghouse ElectricCompany and which I have myself put through various tests at their works atPittsburgh.”12Although initially rejected by the commission, the Forbes report caught the eyeof Adams. Nevertheless, Adams went to Switzerland to confer with C. E. L. Brown,who declined the offers to head up the Niagara project.Morgan’s emissary was Francis Lynde Stetson, a lawyer who was also part of theCataract Construction Company. He was sent to Switzerland and London to reviewthe prevailing technology for their company, GE, but it was starting to becomeobvious that the major patents were all owned by Westinghouse. In Tivoli, wherethere were waterfalls 334 feet high, Ganz & Company of Budapest, anotherWestinghouse-linked operation, was constructing a hydroelectric plant totransmit electricity to Rome, which was eighteen miles away, and in Portland,Oregon, at Willamette Falls, Westinghouse was also transmitting thousands ofvolts of AC over distances of twelve miles. Although Kelvin sided with Edison ininsisting that DC was superior, Adams now knew that Westinghouse held all thetrump cards.13In America, however, and from the point of view of GE, the outcome was not allthat obvious. The Panic of 1893 had taken its toll, and Charles Coffin, CEO ofGE, was forced to “ruthlessly” lay off a large number of their workers and cutthe pay of many others. Not only had production of electrical equipment fallendramatically, in-fighting between the Edison and Thomson camps peaked.14Although Thomson and Steinmetz now realized that AC was vastly superior to DC,they were unable to guarantee to Coffin that they could devise equipmentsuperior to Tesla’s. Desperate to compete, it appears that a memorandum was sentby Thomson to E. G. Waters, general manager of the GE plant in Pittsburgh, forthe purpose of recruiting an informant who worked for Westinghouse.15Noticing that blueprints were missing, Westinghouse accused GE of industrialespionage, and charges were brought against Thomson’s Lynn plant, where asheriff, acting under court order, found the missing documents. The GE officialsclaimed that their interest was in seeing whether Westinghouse was piratingtheir protected lightbulbs, and the jury split six to six on the decision.Westinghouse suspected that a janitor was the culprit, but the man was neverprosecuted.16Simultaneously, Steinmetz and Thomson were submitting patent applications for anAC motor which used a “teaser current” instead of a full-fledged polyphaseone,17 but it was obvious to the patent office that the apparatus was based onthe Tesla system, and their patent application was denied. This did not stopThomson from insisting that he was the real inventor of the AC system, and by1894, with Thomson’s great expertise, he devised an induction motor that in somerespects was superior to the one produced by Westinghouse.18 Ironically, even tothis day, biographies of Elihu Thomson often accuse Tesla of the piracy insteadof the reverse!19 Although GE was brought to trial for stealing blueprints, theyaudaciously continued for the next several years, through Waters, to pay spiesto obtain information from the Westinghouse plant.Nevertheless, Westinghouse’s success at Telluride and at the Chicago World’sFair eliminated any remaining doubts as to who would be awarded the Niagaracontract. In the first months of 1893, Forbes, Rowland, and Sellers visitedPittsburgh to test their equipment, and in May of that year the deal was signedwith Westinghouse.As J. Pierpont Morgan was the major force behind GE, it is interesting tospeculate about why he allowed Westinghouse to gain the bid. First of all, whenthe actual contract was signed, because the operation was so enormous (andbecause of Morgan’s ties to GE), a large portion of the work was also given toGE. Westinghouse constructed the “generators, switchgear and auxiliary equipmentin the powerhouse, [and] GE was awarded contracts for the transformers, thetransmission line to Buffalo, and the equipment for the substation there.”20Thus, although Westinghouse got the larger share, GE was by no means cut out andin fact ended up with a licensing arrangement which gave them their first legalfoothold on the fundamental patents held by the other company.Morgan had close ties to August Belmont, who was one of Westinghouse’s financialbackers, and it is possible that this connection had something to do with thearrangement. He acquiesced in part because of his respect for the commissionAdams had set up and also because of the advice he received from his lawyerWilliam B. Rankine, who lived in Buffalo and who had devoted his life to theenterprise, and his close associate, Francis Lynde Stetson, who told Morgan ofTesla’s “daring promise [as far back as 1890] to place 100,000 hp on a wire andsend it 450 miles in one direction to New York City, the metropolis of the East,and 500 miles in the other direction to Chicago, the metropolis of the West,[to] serve the purpose of these great urban communities.”21In 1894, Tesla hit his stride. The Martin article in the Century opened thefloodgates, and an army of reporters from newspapers and magazines descendedupon him. That year would find features on Tesla in such prestigious periodicalsas New Science Review, Outlook and Cassiers; McClure’s and Review of Reviewsboldly announced that Tesla was the founder of the discoveries which lay behind“the largest electrical enterprise in the world,”22 and the New York Timesprofiled him in a four-column spread complete with a large stylized portrait andan in-depth account of his philosophies and newest creations.23 The followingyear, the Times wrote, “To Tesla belongs the undisputed honor of being the manwhose work made this Niagara enterprise possible…There could be no betterevidence of the practical qualities of his inventive genius.”24Since the contracts with Westinghouse and GE had been signed, Adams no longerhad to pretend to be unbiased; now he was free to seek business ventures. Hecame down to New York to visit Tesla at his laboratory, and there Adams wasintroduced to the inventor’s new mechanical and electrical oscillators and to arevolutionary new AC system of lighting that was vastly superior to the existingone. Adams offered Tesla $100,000 for a controlling interest in “fourteen U.S.patents, many foreign patents,” and any future inventions which Tesla mightconceive. The inventor accepted the proposal.25 In February 1895, the creationof the Nikola Tesla Company was formally announced, with the directors beingTesla, Alfred S. Brown of New York, Charles Coaney of New Jersey, William B.Rankine of Buffalo, Edward D. Adams, and Adams’s son Ernest of Boston.26Tesla had reached the inner sanctum of the corporate world. He now had on hisboard two of the most important members of the Niagara project, and he wassitting on at least a half-dozen entirely new inventions, each of which had thepotential for creating completely new industries. His mechanical oscillatorslooked as if they were going to replace the steam engine; his electricaloscillators were intrinsic to his system of fluorescent lighting, remotecontrol, and his now secret work in wireless transmission; and there were otherideas as well, such as his work in artificial intelligence, ozone production,“cheap refrigeration, and cheap manufacture of liquid air, the manufacture offertilizers and nitric acid from the air.”27 However, all of these inventionswere still, to a great extent, in their developmental stages, and Tesla’s strongsuit was never in manufacturing. He gained his backers ostensibly because of histrack record in AC and because of the promise held by his cold light and variousoscillators. But his real interest, his passion, remained in the wirelesstransmission of power, and most of his time was spent in that direction."},{"pageContent":"15EFFULGENT GLORY (1894) [002-toc.html#ch15]> Dear Mr. Tesla,> > Early in 1894, I told our mutual friend…T.

McFarlan Moore1In February 1894, Tesla went with T. C. Martin to the laboratory of Mr. Bettini,an inventor who had advanced Edison’s work in the perfection of the phonograph.“He wants to display his marvelous collection of song cylinders—Madam Melba,deReszke, Salvini and Bernhardt,” Martin wrote. “He wishes the honor of catchingyour voice as well.”2During this time, Martin continued to forward reviews from Book News, PhysicsReview, and London Electrician. “Praise from Sir Herbert [Spencer] is praiseindeed,” the editor wrote. “Thanks for continuing the Russian translation; theGerman edition is selling as well.”3On the home front, Tesla had formed a new company with two of the coordinatorsof the Niagara project, and he was now turning his attention to designing awireless system that would be able to transmit light, information, andelectrical power. Thus, the inventor worked to perfect his mechanical andelectrical oscillators and vacuum lamps. The mechanical oscillator couldefficiently convert steam to electrical power, the electrical oscillator couldproduce the frequencies necessary for power transmission, and the wirelessfluorescent bulbs could be illuminated when the correct wavelengths were reachedcapable of engendering light. According to Tesla’s theory, if the ether could bemade to oscillate at 500 trillion times per second, pure light would be created.Below that figure, heat was produced.4T. C. Martin continued to play a role somewhat like a manager. In the spring heset up a sitting for the inventor before the sculptor Mr. Wolff, and to Tesla’sdismay, he also arranged an interview with S. S. McClure, the well-knownmagazine editor. Tesla had too many events crammed into his calendar, but T. C.persisted.“I cannot very well call off McClure now,” Martin wrote, “after your littledinner which has simply made him more eager than ever for the article.” Endingthe missive with customary praise, Martin wrote, “He knows now personally, whathe knew before only by hearsay, viz that you are a great man and a nice fellow.I excuse your blushes.”5It would take nearly a year for the Century to complete its own article andorganize the photographing of the celebrated individuals who came to 33-35 SouthFifth Avenue, but finally, in April 1895, Martin’s follow-up piece appeared.Even today, a century later, it remains a spectacular testament to the wizard’sfabled laboratory, for not only did it display many fascinating inventions andprognostications; it also presented dazzling multiple-exposure photographs ofsuch stars of the day as actor Joseph Jefferson, poet F. Marion Crawford, andsorcerer Nikola Tesla. “Martin’s article should be read very carefully to beappreciated,” Tesla wrote Johnson.6With thirty-five homes illuminated by gas for every one lit by electricity, themarket was ripe for a more efficient source. However, Tesla’s fluorescent lampswere still in an experimental stage, as evidenced by the ten-minute time-lapsephotograph of Mark Twain taken for the Martin article.7 The story for Tesla’ssteam dynamo was analogous. According to Martin’s figures, nine-tenths of alldynamos in the country were steam driven. The rest gained their power fromeither compressed air, waterwheels, or gasoline. Since the Tesla oscillator wasforty times more efficient than the prevailing steam-driven dynamo, it seemedthat the marketing of this product would be highly profitable. But again, theperfection of the device was not completed and therefore not yet marketable.Nevertheless, it was revolutionary, and Tesla contacted Babcock & Wilcox tobegin manufacturing prototypes.Before a large number of physicians and engineers of the AmericanElectro-Therapeutic Association at his laboratory in October 1894, Tesla usedthe oscillator to generate electricity for over fifty incandescent lamps andvacuum tubes. Also, “arc lights were shown in operation.” Naturally, theoscillator also generated the extremely high frequencies necessary forengendering beneficial electrotherapeutic effects.8Refining his theory on wireless communication, the inventor realized thatelectrical energy could be transmitted in two distinctly different ways, one asradiation through the air, and the other as conduction through the ground. Todaythis difference corresponds to FM and AM radio. (As an experiment to verify thatFM travels mostly through the air and AM mostly through, or along, the ground,drive your car into an underpass and turn on the radio. When you switch on AM[amplitude modulation], you will probably hear static, whereas FM [frequencymodulation] comes in loud and clear.) “When I showed my experiments to anaudience,” Tesla said, “it would happen that when I wanted to operate singlecircuits with some devices more than one circuit would respond, and people wouldcall my attention to this…I would then have to say that the circuits were notcarefully tuned.”9 Thus the inventor turned his attention to the problem ofcreating separate channels.By studying Herbert Spencer’s theories on resultant forces and nerveconduction,10 Tesla began to realize that he could design vacuum tubes whichwould respond only when a precise combination of two or more circuits were beingtriggered. One of the lamps held by Twain was illuminated in this manner, itsdual circuit triggered by a corresponding dual circuit created by two cableslaid around the room. Like the combination of a safety lock, this invention notonly explains the mechanism behind tuning into different stations on the radio,it also explains the principle behind telephone and TV scramblers. In this way,Tesla attained “the exclusiveness and non-interferability of impulses.11Transmitting messages from an outer circuit to an inner circuit twenty feet awaywas one thing; sending information over long distances was another matterentirely. Tesla had realized for a number of years that the earth carried acharge, and therefore he decided to utilize the planet itself as a carrier ofelectrical energy. If this were so and individualized channels could be created,transmission lines appeared to be superfluous. He therefore began to constructmany different-sized coils to connect to the ground (usually via the water-mainsystem) in order to ascertain the terrestrial period of frequency.With an oscillator constructed for this purpose, Martin wrote, “if he has notyet actually determined the earth’s [precise] electrical charge, or ‘capacity,’he has obtained striking effects which conclusively demonstrate that he hassucceeded in disturbing it…[When his oscillations] are in harmony with theindividual vibrations of the [earth], an intense vibration or surging will beobtained.”12 Martin ended the article with the suggestion that with this devicenot only could information and power be transmitted, but also the weather mightbe modified. “Perchance, we shall ‘call up’ Mars in this way some day, theelectrical charge of both planets being utilized as signals,” Martin concluded,quoting Tesla’s wish at the finale of the exposé.13Classifying Tesla was becoming more and more difficult. Martin portrayed him ina variety of ways—as a practical inventor, a wizard, and an iconoclast; criticsportrayed him as “an impractical…visionary enthusiast.”14 “His inventionsalready show how brilliantly capable he is,” one newspaper reported, but his“propositions…seem like a madman’s dream of empire.”15“One is naturally disappointed that nothing practical has as yet proceeded fromthe magnificent experimental investigations with which Tesla has dazzled theworld,” Lt. F. Jarvis Patten wrote in Electrical World.16 But his solidaccomplishments at Niagara could not be ignored. The article concluded:> Before the general public, he stands as a phenomenal inventor from the Eastern> world, from whom is expected little less than if he carried Aladdin’s lamp in> his hand, which, of course, is wrong, and an injustice both to the public and> to Mr. Tesla…He has doubtless much importance in store for us, but the> difference should never be lost sight of between the search for nature’s> truths in the lab of the physicist and the reduction of the results attained,> however great their promise, to a form suitable for commercial use…If some of> the dreams which Tesla and others are cherishing today ever come to> realization, the magnitude of the ensuing change in the material life of the> world simply defies the imagination.17In Manhattan, Tesla soon caught the eye of Joseph Pulitzer, the German-Hungarianimmigrant and owner of the New York World. Pulitzer sent his newest reporter,Arthur Brisbane, on the interview. Already one of the most widely readcolumnists in the nation, Brisbane had recently jumped from Charles Dana’s NewYork Sun, but at age thirty, Brisbane would soon also leave Pulitzer to becomehead shock reporter for William Randolf Hearst’s up-and-coming yellow Journal.He met Tesla in July 1894.While dining nightly at Delmonico’s restaurant, the reporter was introduced byMr. Delmonico to “a very handsome young man with a pointed black beard.”Brisbane wrote that “Mr. Delmonico lowers his voice when he speaks of Mr. Tesla,as Boston cab drivers used to lower their voicess in speaking of John L.Sullivan.”“That Mr. Tesla can do anything,” Delmonico contended. “We managed to make himplay pool one night. He had never played, but he had watched us for a littlewhile. He was very indignant when he found that we meant to give him fifteenpoints. But it didn’t matter much, for he beat us all and got all the money.”Delmonico noted that they were only playing for quarters, but “it wasn’t themoney we cared about, but the way he studies out pool in his head, and then beatus, after we had practiced for years. [It] surprised us.”18 Considering thatTesla was very proficient at the sport and had slyly kept that informationconfidential makes the story all the more interesting. Tesla could be deceptive,particularly in pecuniary matters.Although the article appeared somewhat disjointed and redundant, it neverthelessaptly described Tesla’s habits and appearance at that time. Tesla would dinefrequently at the popular establishment, always choosing a table by the windowand usually reading a newspaper. Brisbane described Tesla’s “eyes [as being] setvery far back in his head. They are rather light. I asked him how [that] could[be, as he was] a Slav. He told me that his eyes were once much darker, but thatusing his mind a great deal had made them many shades lighter.” This confirmed atheory on brain usage and eye color that Brisbane had heard about.Brisbane went on to write that Tesla “stoops—most men do when they have nopeacock blood in them. He lives inside of himself.” And yet the article wasadorned with the most fantastic full-body engraving of Tesla standing quiteunstooped, proud as a peacock, illuminated like a virtual Christmas tree.This full-page spread remains one of the most spectacular portraits of theinventor ever concocted, and it caused numerous people to ask Tesla how it feltto pump such huge amounts of electricity throughout his body. “I admit that Iwas somewhat alarmed, when I began these experiments,” Tesla admitted, “butafter I understood the principles, I could proceed in an unalarmed manner.”19When pressed for details a number of years later at the Harvard Club, theinventor responded:> [When] the body of a person [is] subjected to the rapidly alternating pressure> of an electrical oscillator of two and one half million volts [this] presents> a sight marvelous and unforgettable. One sees the experimenter standing on a> big sheet of fierce, blinding flame, his whole body enveloped in a mass of> phosphorescent streamers, like the tentacles of an octopus.

As he stretches out the arms, roaring tongues of> fire leap from his fingertips as myriads of minute projectiles are shot off> from him with such velocities as to pass through the adjoining walls. He is in> turn being violently bombarded by the surrounding air and dust.20Tesla was walking a difficult line and revealing contradictory natures:reclusive versus natural showman. The interest of the press made it difficult toprotect against piracy. He wanted to disclose, for public and historicalpurposes, his overall goal, but he had to keep vital details confidential. Onereporter who had spent a day with “this kindly wizard of Washington Square”revealed that Tesla “confided to me that he was engaged on several secretexperiments of most abundant promise, but their nature cannot be hinted at here.However, I have Mr. Tesla’s permission to say that some day he proposes totransmit vibrations through the earth [so] that it will be possible to send amessage from an ocean steamer to a city, however distant, without the use of anywire.”21 Even his laboratory workers were insulated from the details of hissecret experiments.22After calculating the size of the planet and the hypothetical wavelength ofsolar rays, Tesla constructed a transmitter with several circuits capable ofengendering their electrical charge into the earth. One end of the instrumentwas attached to the ground via the radiator or water main, and the other end wasconnected to a cable which Tesla brought to the roof of the building as anaerial connection. With Mr. Diaz Buitrago, his draughtsman, in charge of thetransmitter, the inventor would take his receiving instruments as far as fivemiles away. His first experiments were set up on the roof of the Hotel Gerlach,approximately thirty blocks from the lab. With balloons filled with hot air,helium, or hydrogen to hold the elevated terminal (aerial) high above thebuildings and a cable attached to the water main of the hotel, Tesla set up hisreceivers and verified that, indeed, electrical energy could be secured from histransmitter.23Had Tesla taken a reporter with him on any one of these excursions, it is quitepossible that the generally accepted history of the invention of wirelesstransmission would be completely different, because in all of Tesla’s years, henever demonstrated before a viewing body any long-distance wireless effects.Still three years away from expressing details of his wireless work in patentapplications, Tesla had actually hidden some of his plans in patents alreadysecured on his mechanical and electrical oscillators drawn up in 1891 and1893.24 This would present a problem for Michael Pupin, who was alsoexperimenting with resonance effects and the transmission of simultaneousmessages. However, Pupin’s goal involved the improvement of the prevailingtelephone and telegraph lines. He was not attempting to send messages withoutthem.Pupin realized that by equally spacing pulsations of AC, the rapidity and numberof transmissions could be increased greatly. Unfortunately, his February 1894patent prospectus was easily covered in Tesla’s existing inventions andhigh-frequency lectures.25Tesla had announced in London, in February 1892, that “if the wave length of theimpulses is much smaller than the length of the wire, then corresponding shortwaves…would [greatly] reduce the capacity [making it] possible to send over thewire high frequency currents at enormous distances. [Furthermore], the characterof the vibrations would not be greatly affected.” The creation of a “screen” to“cut the wire into smaller sections” would make it possible to transmit manytelephonic messages over the transatlantic cable.26These patents and published announcements in no way deterred Pupin. He felt thathe had discovered something, and he began a long campaign against the U.S.Patent Office in attempts to bulldoze his way into a legal foothold. The prize,if successful, would be enormous, as he would have exclusive rights on a way tosuccessfully transmit at the same time large numbers of noninterferinglong-distance telephonic and telegraphic conversations over the same wires.Pupin’s nemesis was John Seymour, commissioner of patents.The Columbia University professor’s first strategy was to write up a patentapplication. He submitted it on February 10, 1894, claiming, “I certainlyconsider myself the first to make a practical application of this principle tomultiple telegraphy.”27Seymour’s reply a few months later was that Pupin’s “claims…are rejected on thearrangement of apparatus shown…by patents by Thomson and Rice…[and by] Tesla’sarticle Experiments in Alternating Currents.” Seymour also cited the exact pageand figure number, concluding that Pupin had merely “multiplied Mr. Tesla’selectric light circuits,” which in no way was a new invention.28Hiring a lawyer to help him put together a legalistic-looking circular, Pupinargued that he had indeed been the inventor of the “Art of DistributingElectrical Energy by Alternating Currents.” The typeset brief, which resembledan official court document, read in part as follows: “Tesla produced luminouseffects, and did not consider multiplex signalling…He does not disclose severalexciting circuits acting on the main line, with means for tuning each excitingcircuit independently…The applicant was the first to apply the principle uponwhich the claims are based and did more than merely multiply the Tesla electriccircuit.”29Seymour wrote back: “Claims 1, 2 and 3 are again rejected on Tesla. It is wellknown in the art that several periodicities may be simultaneously impressed onthe same line…The examiner can see no more in these claims than a multiplicationof Tesla’s circuit in a manner well understood in the art.”30Pupin was adamant. He was convinced that he had been the first to invent theobvious and, furthermore, that he had a total right to make use of Tesla’soscillators, as they were now being generally accepted as the optimum-frequencygenerators for long-distance electrical transmissions. By studying eachrejection notice by the U.S. Patent Office, Pupin kept refining the language ofhis patent in order to try and come upon a way that would secure a legalfoothold for him. Moreover, Pupin continued to convince himself that indeed thisinvention was his.Altering history in his mind and erasing Tesla in his classroom, Pupin wouldcontinue his battle to secure this highly lucrative patent on the means oftransmitting many simultaneous messages over long distances. His battle wouldcontinue for another six years, until after John Seymour retired.The year 1894 was a banner one. In July the spectacular portrait of Teslaappeared in the World. He had major coverage in Electrical World, the New YorkTimes and Review of Reviews, and his AC polyphase system was going to beutilized at Niagara Falls. Tesla had formed a partnership with financiers fromWall Street, he had invited the historical giants of his age to his workplace,and he had made marked improvements in experiments in wireless communication.The year closed with an invitation by Tesla to the Johnsons to come to his shop.“Dear Luka,” Tesla wrote on December 21, “You have not forgotten the visit to mylaboratory tomorrow I hope. Dvořák will be there and a number of othercelebrities in America’s elite.”31Anton Dvořák, fifteen years Tesla’s senior, had immigrated from his nativeCzechloslovakia in 1892, to be appointed director of the National Conservatoryof Music. Forever homesick, Dvořák stayed in the United States for only threeyears, but during that time he composed some of his most famous works,particularly the New World Symphony. After the performance, Dvořák visited thewizard’s lab. Christmas and New Year’s Eve with the Johnsons would round out onetruly remarkable year."},{"pageContent":"16FIRE AT THE LAB (1895) [002-toc.html#ch16]> The destruction of Nikola Tesla’s workshop, with its wonderful contents, is> something more than a private calamity.

McFarlan Moore, a colleague of great promisein the field of fluorescent lighting, when the Serbian savant “deliberatelystopped” and pensively proclaimed, “Moore, after we have signalled from anypoint to any point on the earth, the next step will be signalling to otherplanets.”2Before the inventor could undertake such an enormous task, he first had toperfect wireless effects over long distances on the earth. One of his plans wasto send messages from his laboratory to receiving equipment which he was goingto place on a Hudson River steamboat.3 Unfortunately, on March 13, 1895, Tesla’slaboratory burned to the ground. The “whole floor collapsed and equipmentdropped to [the] second floor.”4For one fleeting moment, the civilized world was in shock, for the demolition ofthe maestro’s atelier was a tragedy of incalculable proportions. Fortunately,Tesla was not injured, for he was asleep in his hotel at the time. “Twotottering brick walls and the yawning jaws of a somber cavity aswim with blackwater and oil were all that could be seen [that fateful] morning…of a laboratorywhich to all who had visited it was one of the most interesting spots onearth.”5This “coming great man,” Current Literature noted, “[who] lives his life, as ina dream, forgetful of the lapse of time, and living only for the future…[wasabout to] revolutionize the cost and economies of electric lighting, and placeit within the reach of the humblest and poorest of people…To have all of…hisinnumerable marvels…swept away at one stroke is a calamity to the whole world aswell as to himself.”6 Perhaps in part to help cheer Tesla up and “in honor ofthe Serbian-American pioneer of electric communication, the Postal-TelegraphUnion of Serbia caused a sensation by connecting a simultaneous concert inBelgrade and Nis by telephone so that both audiences could hear it.”7“The Tesla laboratory was, in a sense, a private museum,” T. C. Martin wrote.“The owner kept in it many souvenirs of bygone toil and experiment.” Afterdescribing in detail its contents, Martin concluded: “Perhaps the most painfulloss of all is the destruction of Mr. Tesla’s notes and papers. His memory isall right, and flashes on any experiment of the past with the revealing power ofa search-light, but the time it will take for the inventor to recreate hisongoing investigations will also cost other experimenters years of sweat andpain…[Nevertheless,] while the ashes of his hopes lay hot…Tesla was at workagain with clenched determination.”8The strain was enormous, and Tesla steeled himself to fight off depression. Onepaper reported that he suffered a “physical collapse.”9To help keep his spirits up, Martin met with the inventor at a local cafe togive him more free copies of their book; he may have also given him money.10“Ere, it please your majesty,” the editor said with a bow, “your experimentshave been repeated in Berlin under your name with the Emperor’s brother, PrinceHenry, assisting. If you did not get a daily bolster from me you would have arelapse into dullness as you do when you miss your daily dose of electricity.”The duo sat down to review Martin’s article on the burning of the lab so that amore accurate description of its lost contents could be enumerated.”Westinghouse was still in the midst of battling William Stanley of the WilliamStanley Company and Elihu Thomson of GE in patent litigation, as each wascontinuing to produce AC induction motors illegally while at the same timeimplying that the invention was of their own design. Together, these twoconcerns outsold Westinghouse by 10,000 kilowatts for the period 1893-97.12According to some, their motors and generators were more efficient. Stanley, whocontinued to brazenly promulgate the sale of his polyphase system inadvertisements in the electrical journals, had by this time increased hisoperation from fifteen men to a few hundred, and GE was more than twice thatsize.Embroiled in the numerous patent disputes, the Westinghouse Company decided totake out a full-page advertisement which proclaimed:> Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company> sole owners of the> Tesla Polyphase SystemThe display continued: “The novelty of Mr. Tesla’s inventions was recognized byProf. Elihu Thomson, who said in discussing the Tesla inventions before theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1888: ‘I have certainly been verymuch interested in the description given by Mr. Tesla of his new and admirablelittle motor. I have, as probably you may be aware, worked in somewhat similardirections and towards similar ends. The trials which I have made have been bythe use of a single alternating current circuit, not a double alternatingcircuit.’”13Although GE intimated that the Tesla motor was dangerous because it gave off toomany sparks, there is no evidence that the fire in Tesla’s lab was caused by hisequipment. It had started in the floor below, in a dry-cleaning establishment.Some investigators intimated that a careless night watchman may have beenresponsible, perhaps by smoking near oily rags.14Estimates of the uninsured loss ranged as high as a million dollars, but theactual damage was probably closer to $250,000. O’Neill suggests that Adams cameto the rescue by advancing $40,000 in return for a piece of the company.15However, Adams was already a partner, and thus, he, Tesla, and the otherpartners all suffered losses. Still, there is some evidence that Adams didprovide further assistance at this time.16 Royalties from Europe and continuingmodest annual payments from the Westinghouse Company helped offset themisfortune, but clearly Tesla now needed to raise additional revenue in order toopen up a new place.In particular, Tesla received a number of letters from friendly members of theWestinghouse Company. Ernest Heinreich, an engineer and author, wrote, “I hastento offer you my sincere regret,” Not knowing the situation, he continued, “Itrust that you were well insured and will be able very soon to find anothersuitable location to carry on your work.”17Tesla was uninsured, but he had generated too much momentum to slow hisprogress. Within a few days, he was out scouting new locations. In the interim,he turned to the one lab where he knew vital equipment would be on hand. For thenext few weeks, Nikola Tesla rolled up his sleeves at Tom Edison’s workshop atLlewellyn Park, New Jersey, a laboratory that “shuts out everybody who has notbeen given a pass by Mr. Edison himself, or one of his assistants.”18Simultaneously, he contacted Albert Schmid for more equipment, scoffing, as washis nature, at any expense which might be incurred. “I shall rely, as to theprice, entirely on the fairness of the Westinghouse Co.,” Tesla said,concluding: “I believe that there are gentleman in that company who believe in ahereafter.”19Vice president and general manager Samuel Bannister shipped, as a gift, someearly Tesla models which had been saved from the World’s Fair and wrote of hisregret concerning “your misfortune…I am glad to know that you took off your coatto work to get everything back into shape as soon as possible.”20 However, thiswas little consolation, as the Westinghouse Company would begin to bill Teslafor the cost of machinery lost in the fire which was on loan; they also chargedhim for new equipment.In April, partly in response to Brisbane’s announcement that Tesla was “greatereven than Edison,”21 the rivalry between the two men, at least in the press,intensified. “Who Is King, Edison or Tesla?” the Troy Press of New Yorkinquired.22 Joseph Jefferson, speaking in Boston, left no doubt about hisposition. “Edison has been deposed,” the thespian proclaimed, “and Tesla hasbeen coronated [new potentate].”23The “Twin Wizards of Electricity” met in May in Philadelphia, along withAlexander Graham Bell, at the National Electrical Exposition. For the first timeever, Tesla’s AC was transmitted the grand distance of five hundred miles. Teslawas disappointed that no appreciable amount of power was transported along theexisting telephone lines for fear, by the underwriters, that damage or a firecould result. Nevertheless, the experiment was a complete success and dwarfedthe achievements of the old hundred-mile Lauffen-Frankfurt record.“The most amazing thing at this exposition,” Edison remarked, “is thedemonstration of the ability to deliver here an electric current generated atNiagara Falls. To my mind it solves one of the most important questionsassociated with electrical development.” Bell concurred, stating, “This longdistance transmission of electric power was the most important discovery ofelectric science that had been made for many years.”“[Bell] with Edison, looking into the future, realized that by means of thisdiscovery cities and towns remote from the places of electrical generation wouldbe able to obtain the services of this agent…with great economy…[and with] apractical convenience far superior than is now possible.”Tesla, “who solved the problem,” stated, “I am now convinced beyond any questionthat it is possible to transmit electricity…by water power…to commercialadvantage over a distance of 500 miles at half the cost of generation by steam[or coal]…I am willing to stake my reputation and my life upon thisdeclaration.”24No record exists of what was said between Tesla and Edison on this occasion, butit seems likely that each was privately amused by the rivalry played out in thepress, that Tesla thanked Edison for the temporary use of his laboratory, andthat Edison expressed his condolences for the loss of Tesla’s workplace.GE was now losing the propaganda campaign on all fronts. Even Edison wasadmitting Tesla’s accomplishment. Rumors began to circulate that an agreementwith Westinghouse was reached on the pooling of patents, but a total solutionwas a number of years away, partly because GE had so many divisions that werepirating the apparatus, and partly because Westinghouse saw no immediateadvantage in making a deal.25 After one significant loss in the courts, theheadquarters of GE was forced to abandon its position; but they would continueto bargain because their financiers controlled the Niagara enterprise. Moreover,the size of that venture prevented Westinghouse from tackling it alone. T. C.Martin, however, naively thought that a complete reconciliation and vindicationfor Tesla was at hand. “This would [now] mean the acknowledgement of supremacyof your polyphase patents,” he wrote. “I suppose each will license the other.”26It does not appear that Tesla enlightened him on the finality of the deal he hadsigned, because one full year later, the editor discussed the subject again. “Icannot tell you how pleased I am about the news of the recognition of yourpatents by G.E. Company, and I hasten to congratulate you…[This] ought to fillyour pockets with your own money,” Martin concluded.27At least from a historical perspective, vindication was at hand, for now it wasaccepted even by the opposition that Tesla’s work alone was making possible the“yoking into service of old Niagara herself”;28 but the inventor would neverreap any financial gains other than those he had already settled for.“This discovery forms the basis,” Review of Reviews announced, “of the NiagaraCompany’s attempt to utilize that enormous power which for centuries has beenrunning to waste, and thus to turn machinery in towns and cities so far away asBuffalo, 20 miles distant, and perhaps New York and Chicago.” And then themagazine dropped the bombshell. “And it underlies the hardly less bold ventureof the Westinghouse and Baldwin companies to drive a through railway express byelectricity. It is not too much to say that the Tesla motor is behind all thelarge attempts at power transmission by electricity which are being madethroughout the country, not only in the fields of manufacture andtransportation, but also in mining, irrigation and farming.”29> August, 7, 1895> > My dear Mr. Westinghouse,> > I learn from the journals of your friendly agreement with the Baldwin> Locomotive works…The news of your consolidation has been an agreeable> surprise.

The Westinghouse Corporation was billing himfor lost equipment and for new machines ordered, and yet they had just gainedtwo gargantuan contracts in two entirely separate fields, both based on hiscreation. Surely the corporation would overlook a few thousand dollars owed,especially when it was Tesla’s personality that played a key role in gatheringsuch principals of the Niagara Company as Edward Dean Adams, John Jacob Astor,and William Birch Rankine into the fold.It also occurred to the inventor that use of his induction motor in an entirelynovel field such as railway transportation was, in a sense, outside the originalintent of their contract. Should not he also benefit from such a fortuitous turnof events? Tesla would continue, somewhat naively, to bring new potentialclients to Pittsburgh, almost as if he were their private ambassador, but hewould never receive additional compensation for the service."},{"pageContent":"17MARTIAN FEVER (1895-96) [002-toc.html#ch17]> If there are intelligent inhabitants of Mars or any other planet, it seems to> me that we can do something to attract their attention…I have had this scheme> under consideration for five or six years.> > NIKOLA TESLA1John Jacob Astor III graduated from Harvard University at the age of twenty-twoin 1888. He was one of the wealthiest men on the planet, with assets in theneighborhood of $100 million. By comparison, J. Pierpont Morgan’s wealth wasperhaps $30 million. As a youth, Astor had been an inventor, having patented abicycle brake and a pneumatic walkway which won a prize at the 1893 ChicagoWorld’s Fair. Other inventions included a storage battery, aninternal-combustion engine, and a flying machine.2During his college years, when he was known by the unfortunate nickname of “JackAss,” Astor, who now sported long, tapered sideburns and a waxed mustache, hadundertaken courses with the inimitable astronomy professor William Pickering.One of Astor’s pet projects was to find a way to create rain by “pumping warm,moist air from the earth’s surface into the upper atomosphere,” but the U.S.Patent Office had turned him down.3 Thus, when Pickering mentioned that theseasons were due to the inclination of the earth’s axis off of the ecliptic,Astor became intrigued. If the earth were not tilted away from the sun,Pickering suggested, it would probably have one uniform, moderate climate evenat the extreme north and south latitudes.As part of the curriculum, Astor was introduced to the Harvard Observatory.There, along with such up and comers as Perceival Lowell, brother of thepresident of the university, Astor could peer through the great telescope andview such wonders as the craters on the moon, the satellites of Jupiter, andSaturn’s spectacular rings.In April 1890, Professor Pickering made headlines when he photographed what hesaid was a snowstorm on the planet Mars. He calculated that the area covered wasalmost equal to that of the United States.4 Two years later, during a celebratedtrip to Harvard’s observatory in Arequipa, Peru, the bushily bearded professorannounced another major discovery: “lakes in great numbers on Mars. The canals,”Pickering proclaimed, “have dark as well as bright regions. We also observedclouds, and the melting of snows, and this confirmed Herschel’s hypothesis thatthere was vegetation around the regions of water.”5The idea of attempting to signal “Marsians,” as they were then called, was afamiliar ambition of the day, and Astor, like Tesla, was caught in the fancy ofit. In 1894, Perceival Lowell announced in Nature his description of the canalsof Mars. At the same time, Astor, just thirty years old, completed a sciencefiction novel about space travel. Entitled A Journey in Other Worlds, his bookoffered a futuristic vision of what takes place one century into the future. Afew months after publication, in February 1895, the financier presented a copyto the great inventor.Although Tesla did not appear to be particularly impressed by the work, theinventor promised Astor to keep it “as an interesting and pleasant memento ofour acquaintance.”6Adorned with ethereal outer-space illustrations by Dan Beard, Astor’s talebegins in the year 2000, with a meeting at Delmonico’s restaurant of theTerrestrial Axis Straightening Company, whose task it is to create fair weatherthroughout the planet.Astor envisions for “the close of the 20th Century” a picture telephone, anairplane with the ability to fly to Europe in one day, an electric automobile,hidden phonographs by the police to record conversations of criminals, colorphotography, a rain-making device, the idea of colonizing the solar system, andthe understanding that the earth would appear like a crescent moon when seenfrom outer space.Perhaps Astor’s most impressive prediction is the path that his “spaceship”Callisto takes on its journey to Jupiter. Astor hypothesizes that just asmagnetism has a repelling force, gravity should as well. This energy, which hecalled apergy, is simply the opposite of gravity. By harnessing apergy, theastronauts in the story aim their ship first toward the sun, then “change theircourse to something like a tangent to the earth, and [receive] their final rightdirection [back out toward Jupiter] in swinging near the moon…to bring apergyinto play.”7 Exactly a century after this book appeared, NASA actually did senda spacecraft, named the Galileo, on a voyage along a remarkably similartrajectory, using Venus instead of the moon as the pivot for the swing-back outtoward Jupiter. Whereas this modern trip will take a few years, Astor’s wearytravelers cover the distance in a matter of days. Jupiter is abundant with life.Flowers greet them by “sing[ing] with the volume of a cathedral organ.” The redspot, they find out, was caused by a forest changing color due to a cold snap.8Armed, the astronauts are able to hunt down animals resembling mastodons whichthey kill for food. Fortunately, they also have the wherewithall to hop backonto the Callisto so that they can return to Earth.Fueled by a competitive spirit, the newspapers and magazines continued topromulgate the idea that Mars was inhabited by beings possibly more intelligentthan we. As Tesla made headlines in the New York dailies and electrical journalsfor his bold prediction that he would “signal the stars” and Astor made thebookstores with his space traveling “romance of the future,” other luminarieswere also capitalizing on the extraterrestrial fervor.In 1895, George Lathrop, son-in-law of novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, hadearthlings battle warriors from the Red Planet on the pages of the New YorkJournal. Their weapons were disintegrating death rays invented by the Wizard ofMenlo Park, Thomas Edison. The following year, George duMaurier, grandfather ofDaphne, wrote the novel The Martian, in which he describes telepathic wingedbeings “that descend from no monkey” but are able to adorn marble statues andirrigate the entire planet.9 And the year after, H. G. Wells gained notorietywith his serialized Person’s magazine horror story War of the Worlds, in whichghastly octupus-like Martians storm Earth in their egg-shaped spaceships andtake over.Although fictional, these stories were based on prognostications put forward bysupposedly sober scientists. The major culprit was the French astronomer andpsychic researcher Camille Flammarion. In Stories of Infinity: Lumen—History ofa Comet in Infinity, published in 1873, Flammarion interviewed “Lumen,” asagacious returning comet, on such topics as the speed of light, time travel,and life on other planets. Lumen: “Ah, if you knew the organisms that vibrate onJupiter or Uranus…you would know that some living beings can understand withouteyes, ears or smell; that there are other faculties of an unascertainable numberin nature essentially different than yours.”10This idea, called the plurality of worlds hypothesis, is an antediluvian conceptwhich, through the ages, has counted numerous scientists among its adherents.Early astronomers such as Kepler, Newton, Laplace, and Herschel took thisposition, along with such modern astrophysicists as Carl Sagan.Human beings, grasping the immensity of the cosmos, know that life is notnecessarily unique to Earth. Roman and Greek mythology, which concerned thelives and responsibilities of specific deities and included a god for each ofthe known planets, probably served as a psychological template for astronomers’speculations and corresponding religious beliefs.Carl Jung has linked such mythological thinking to the belief in UFOs, thesearch for meaning, and the search for God. Identifying God with the unknowable,the unconscious, and the wisdom revealed in dream interpretation, Jung says thatthe myth arises through attempts by the conscious to understand theunconscious.11 Thus, the mysteries of outer space are connected with those ofinner space. Primordial instincts, archetypes, would therefore be the mechanismevolved through attempts to explain celestial natural phenomena. Over time,these were transformed into the myths of our forefathers.This belief in ancient sky gods and extraterrestrial existence stems from acommon motif, that is, that humans cannot be the highest beings in the cosmosand, furthermore, that there is a supreme creator. Because the idea strikes adeep chord, through the centuries numerous scientists, artists, and authors havebeen seized by this notion.In 1835, Richard Adams Locke of the New York Sun created a series of front-pagearticles on astronomer Sir John Herschel, discoverer of Uranus and allegeddiscoverer of advanced life-forms on the moon. Locke’s hoax, which spread aroundthe world before it was exposed, was made possible by the fact that Herschel wasin South Africa at the time and therefore out of contact with the press.Herschel’s supposed discoveries of unicorn-like animals and winged humanoidswere made via a marvelous (and fictitious) telescope that was 150 feet long andcould magnify the heavens forty-two thousand times.12 Thirty years later, JulesVerne journeyed his readers to the moon, but by the late 1870s the destinationhad shifted to Mars.The first attempt to create a map of Mars and delineate the features seen on itcan be traced back to Bernard de Fontana and Christian Huygens in the mid-1600s.More detailed drawings were sketched by Herschel in 1830 and by numerous otherscientists in the 1860s and 1870s, such as Camille Flammarion,13 and in the1880s by Giovanni Schiaparelli, who named these channels canali.In two scientific treatises, The Plurality of Worlds and Mars and ItsInhabitants, Flammarion stated his belief that Mars not only housed life butalso intelligent beings. Dwarfed in stature, positioned next to hisfifteenfoot-tall telescope, the bearded French astronomer described in detailthe mountains, valleys, craters, lakes, and oceans of Mars in North AmericanReview in 1896. “It is obvious,” Flammarion concluded, “the world of Marsis…vigorously alive.” Perhaps unconsciously influenced by the 1835 New York Sunhoax, or du Maurier’s story, Flammarion suggested that due to the lightness ofthe atmosphere, “the inhabitants…may have received the privilege of flight…Maythey not rather be like dragon-flies fluttering in the air above the lakes andthe canals?”14Whereas Flammarion only set out to describe the Martians, Tesla actually madeplans to contact them. The most influential American proponent, however, wasundoubtedly the erudite Perceival Lowell, descendant of the famous MassachusettsLowell family. Influenced by Flammarion, Lowell would capture the front page ofthe newspapers on many occasions with “Mars inhabited” headlines. He would alsocome to author a number of scholarly accounts covered in such prestigiousjournals as Nature and Scientific American,15 all culminating in his weightytext The Canals of Mars, disseminated by the distinguished Macmillan PublishingCompany.16Unlike the warlike humans of Earth, Martians dwelled in a coordinated world,Lowell speculated. They had outgrown their savage instincts and “consciouslypractice peace.” These Martians were “sagacious builders” who conserved theirprecious water and learned to live in a civilized global society.Mars was an older and thus more experienced planet. Its people had lived throughthe technological revolution aeons ago, so they had learned to harvest andcultivate their planet from a global perspective.With humanity at the dawn of a new technological society, it was comforting tothink that we would not have to face this rapidly advancing condition alone. Asone of a community of intelligent planets, we had neighbors to whom we couldturn for guidance.By the late 1890s, Lowell had completed construction of his own gargantuantelescope at Flagstaff, Arizona, where it is still, today, one of the finest inthe world. There he would report each new discovery, including the cataloging ofgalaxies, which at the time were called “island universes.”It is hard to overestimate Lowell’s impact on contemporary thinking. Forinstance, the vegetation hypothesis was echoed by Wernher von Braun, Willy Ley,and P. Bonestell, who cowrote in their 1956 text The Exploration of Mars: “Andthis is the picture of Mars at mid-century: a small planet which ¾ths is colddesert, with the rest covered with a sort of plant life [most likelylichen]…Mars is not the dead planet…but neither can it be inhabited by the kindof intelligent beings that many people dreamed of in 1900.”17A society’s beliefs determines its reality. But society is made up ofindividuals, and in the case of the idea that Mars was inhabited, theseindividuals often embellished their supposed objective scientific findings.Supported vigorously by the press, the most important proponents of the “life onMars” scenario were the astronomers, but the position was also championed by theinventors.Elihu Thomson, a longtime stargazer and friend of Professor Pickering’s, was soenthusiastic that he often took his telescope to his factories so that workerscould see the Martian canal system with their own eyes.18 Other eminentscientists included Lord Kelvin, who, upon his arrival in America in September1897, announced to the press his idea to flash a signal at night from theglittering metropolis of New York City to Mars to let them know we are here. Nodoubt he discussed this plan with Tesla when he visited his laboratory duringthe journey.19 Edison, too, was caught up in esoteric causes, but his wish wasto invent a telephone-like device to contact departed spirits rather than livingMartians.“The possibility of beckoning Martians was the extreme application of [my]principle of propagation of electric waves,” Mr. Tesla told the interviewers in1896 in the article “Is Tesla to Signal the Stars?” “The same principle may beemployed with good effects for the transmission of news to all parts of theearth…Every city on the globe could be on an immense circuit. [Thus] a messagesent from New York would be in England, Africa and Australia in an instant. Whata grand thing it would be.”20"},{"pageContent":"18HIGH SOCIETY (1894-97) [002-toc.html#ch18]> Nikola Tesla is one of the great geniuses and most remarkable men who have> ever had anything to do with electricity…It is as much of an honor to propose> him for membership as his membership would be an addition to the club.> > LETTER TO THE PLAYERS’ CLUB BY STANFORD WHITE1Commuting to New Jersey was only a temporary solution, and within a few weeks,Tesla returned to New York, where he secured a laboratory just below GreenwichVillage, near Chinatown, at 46 and 48 Houston Street. Nervous and perpetually onthe brink of exhaustion, Tesla began to experiment with the healing propertiesof his oscillators as reports began to filter in from around the country aboutits remarkable curative properties. These high-frequency “vitality boosters”would generate a “universal healing agent” that, when applied, would enable thebody to “throw off all diseases,” said Dr. F. Finch Strong. “Effects obtained[included]…increase of strength, appetite and weight, induction of naturalsleep, and elimination.”2 Other doctors reported the ability to curetuberculosis.“Tesla believes that electricity is the greatest of all doctors and says thatwhen his laboratory was burned, nothing but regular daily applications ofelectricity kept him from sinking into a state of melancholia.”3 “My highfrequencies,” he would say, “produce an anti-germicidal action.” Thus, as partof his routine for a day at the lab, the inventor would disrobe, step upon hisapparatus, and turn on the juice. A prickly corona would envelop his body andrestore it to a more pristine condition.Electricity had become the new panacea; it could cure the sick, eradicate thecriminals, and even eliminate recalcitrant undergrowth that “interfere[d] withthe running of trains…Weeding has always been considered very hard work, butwith the aid of the electrical weeder, a man has only to touch a button and theweeds vanish.”4In May 1895, Tesla and the Johnsons attended the dedication ceremony for the newarch, situated as the gateway, looking south, to Greenwich Village at WashingtonSquare Park and looking north to the beginning of Fifth Avenue. Designed byStanford White, “the dashing man with the red moustache,” the lofty edificestood taller and wider than any comparable one erected by the mighty ancientRomans or Greeks. Johnson had recited one of his poems in honor of the originalwooden one which had been built in 1889.This was but one more connection between Tesla and the celebrated StanfordWhite, whose many other monuments and buildings were rapidly reshaping the cityinto a regal testament to the great and vibrant gay era. Tesla would often runinto White at the offices of the Century, where the artist would be commissionedto illustrate their covers, and at meetings involving the Niagara Fallsenterprise at Delmonico’s, the Waldorf, and the theater or the Madison SquareGarden roof restaurant. Having designed the Players’ Club in Manhattan in 1887,the Tennis Club in Newport, churches, and numerous mansions, White was also aninterior decorator. It was said that he knew the color of the boudoir of everywoman of note in the city. A trendsetter and sensualist, White became one of theleading choreographers of the ambience of the percolating metropolis. Goodfriends with the inventor, White often talked with Tesla about their sharedvision of the future.Tesla had met White in 1891 when the piano virtuoso Ignace Paderewski played theGarden for five breathtaking performances. Edward Dean Adams was in the midst ofcourting both men, Tesla for his inventions and White for his architecturalprowess, and he wanted to get the two together to discuss the best way to placeWestinghouse’s behemoth electric generators in the upcoming powerhouse.“My dear Mr. Adams,” White wrote, “I duly received the information of theCataract Construction Company and will pitch in [as soon as possible]…With McKimin Chicago and Mead in Canada I am here alone in a sort of maelstrom of work…Ifit were not for the Roof Garden and the ballet girls to cheer me up, I shouldhave been dead long ago.”5 By the end of the year, White had sent Adams designsfor the proposed buildings. Adams reciprocated by sending White a magnificenttext on precious stones and a “stunning gift” (most likely a ruby or emerald).6In 1893, Tesla and White crossed paths again, as both were cardinal participantsin the Chicago World’s Fair. The following year, White, then forty, urged theinventor to become a member of the Players’ Club. “Will you not let me put youup for membership?” he inquired. “It is an inexpensive club and the character ofmen I think you would like, and I know it would give me the greatest pleasure tomeet you there now and then.”7 Tesla requested that Johnson be included formembership, and White agreed.In the heart of winter, in early 1895, White invited Tesla “for a little supper[for] the artist, Ned Abbey, in my room in the Tower,” and Tesla “sharpened hisappetite for the occasion.”8 There, in White’s sanctuary, where one’s mind couldspin a thousand tales, the duo gazed out over the entire city. This momentsymbolized the pinnacle of social achievement, for only the elite could enterWhite’s chamber and only the imagination of the outsiders could discern whatmight transpire. A month later, the inventor reciprocated by asking White, hiswife, Bessie, and their son, Lawrence, to his den.> March 2, 1895> > My dear Tesla,> > I cannot thank you too much for your kindness in showing all your wonderful> experiments the other day. They made a deep impression on me, as they did> everyone, and I am going to see them again someday, if you will let me.> > Sincerely yours,> Stanford White9A fortnight later, the laboratory was in cinders, but for the electronic savant,it was almost as if he were simply shifting gears. In the spring he received arisqué invitation to White’s outrageous “Girl-in-the-Pie Banquet.” As the storygoes, and there are a number of versions, a dozen scantily clad maidens served atwenty-course meal at the notorious photography studio of Jimmy Breese at 5 WestSixteenth Street, the dinners having been shipped from Sherry’s. Attending theclandestine affair were other friends of White’s, including artists AugustSaint-Gaudens and Robert Reid, and the inventor Peter Cooper Hewitt. At theculmination of the feast, with the band playing, the young ladies returned ineven more provocative outfits, singing and wheeling out a pie the size of asmall automobile. To the tune of “Four and Twenty Blackbirds,” the crust burstopen with the flutter of a flock of canaries, and out popped a topless youngwoman. Mum was the word until sketchy details were published in the World.10Tesla became privy to the architect’s salacious activities and may have partakenhimself in discreet entanglements, although it is just as likely that his phobiafor germs or monastic inclinations would have inhibited him. White admiredTesla, as each, in his own way, was a sculptor of the New Age. Meetingoccasionally for a round of pool at the Players’ Club or at a boxing match,perhaps with Twain, at the Garden, Tesla also accompanied White for sailingjaunts out at Southhampton with a dozen members of the clique.On one occasion, White asked Tesla to join him for an outing with Mr. WilliamAstor Chamber, an African explorer. As usual, Tesla was busy at work, but aftersome tactful prodding, he relented. “I am so delighted that you have decided totear yourself away from your laboratory,” White said. “I would sooner have youon board than the Emperor of Germany or the Queen of England.”11The year 1895 was a peculiar one. The U.S. government was nearing bankruptcy. Inthe Panic of 1893 bondholders had wished to secure gold instead of paper money,and the mint had made good by depleting its reserves. By January 1895 the UnitedStates was within days of being unable to meet its debts. Quietly, PresidentCleveland had asked August Belmont, a wealthy Jewish businessman (and backer ofthe Westinghouse Company), to meet with the European Rothschilds to securereplacement gold reserves. The reality of the day, however, included anunfortunate worldwide wave of anti-Semitism. Only the year before, in a famoustrial in France, the Jewish captain Alfred Dreyfus had been convicted on a“trumped up charge of treason.” The Rothschilds were Jewish. How would it lookto have Jewish financiers bail out an entire nation? It was for this reason,according to Morgan biographer George Wheeler, that J. Pierpont Morgan, anupstanding Episcopalian, was brought into the picture.12 Morgan, with Belmont’shelp, was able to secure $60 million in foreign gold reserves, and the countrywas saved from insolvency. The incident also marked the anointment of Morgan asKing of Wall Street.In October, a twenty-two-year-old, well-mannered stenographer named GeorgeScherff walked into Tesla’s laboratory and applied for a job.13 The inventorreviewed the secretary’s credentials and hired him. Although Scherff knewnothing about electrical engineering, Tesla was impressed with his demeanor andintelligence, and within a matter of days the youth was busy at worktranscribing papers and taking over the general management of the office.In the same month, Tesla forwarded a book on Buddhism to Luka, whom he hadn’tseen since the end of the summer. Johnson had traveled with his wife to Italy toreceive a decoration from King Humbert for his work on securing a law forinternational copyright and during this period, Tesla had taken some time toattend lectures in Brooklyn on Buddhism by Swami Vivekananda.14. “My dear Friendand faithful stranger,” Johnson wrote back, “I am touched by your remembrance ofme in sending the book…[I’ll] drop into your laboratory some day for oldacquaintance’s sake.”15“Glad to know that you are again in town and established in the beautifulJohnson Mansion,” Tesla wrote Mrs. Filipov. “I cannot say as much for mylaboratory which is [still in need of] furnishing.”16Tesla reported the local gossip, such as how Stanford had difficulty decidingbetween which of two beautiful sisters to spend an evening with; the gist ofswami Vivekananda’s lectures on the external nature of God and thetransmigration of souls, and of his progress in netting more millionaires. Hewas meeting with railroad magnate and U.S. senator Chauncey DePew; J. BeavorWebb, a fleet captain, shipbuilder, and Morgan man; Darius Ogden Mills, a stockmarket manipulator and principal in GE; and John Jacob Astor.The wealthiest of the crew, except for Astor, was undoubtedly Mills, who hadmade his fortune in San Francisco during the California gold rush. Owner of theNew York Tribune, and a palace on Fifth Avenue “opposite St. Patrick’sCathedral…of which a Shah of Persia might have been proud,”17 Mills had been thesecond private citizen in history, after J. Pierpont Morgan, to have his abodeilluminated by electricity. As Herbert Satterlee tells the story, Mills was soimpressed with the Edison invention that he insisted on becoming a partner inthe company. “Only if for every share of Edison stock you purchase for yourself,you purchase one for me,” Morgan replied, and Mills agreed.18 Tesla had much totell his European traveling friends.At the end of the year, Tesla began to apply more pressure on Edward Dean Adamsto influence John Jacob Astor. The Colonel, as he was now called, was funding,of all people, mountebank John Worrell Keely. This was a situation that had tobe changed. Keely’s motor hadn’t motored in twenty years; Tesla’s had turned theworld. Martin wrote the inventor of his astonishment at Astor’s gullibility;19Tesla pressed Astor for a commitment.Attempting, perhaps, to capitalize on the Christmas spirit, Tesla met with Astorand his nautical counselor, J. Beavor Webb, on December 19 and pitched hiscause. “I am impressed with your endeavor, Mr. Tesla,” Astor commented,“although, as I understand it, your latest inventions are yet to reach the pointof being marketed. Nevertheless, I’ll speak to Mr. Adams. By all means, let’skeep the door open.”Tesla telephoned Adams that afternoon and wrote Astor the following day:> My dear Mr. Astor,> > [Adams] would be only too glad to have you with us. We agreed that we would> jointly provide from 500-1000 shares of the Parent Company for yourself and> Mr. Webb at the price of $95 a share of a par value of $100 each.> > The Parent Company owns my patents…[and rights in foreign and domestic> markets, which I believe] will profoundly affect the present state of the> mechanical and electrical arts, and will create a greater revolution in their> applications than my ideas on the transmission of power which are at present,> generally adopted.20Christmas was drawing near, and with it the renewal of the Serb’s link to hisadopted American family. The invitation from the Johnsons was wholeheartedlywelcomed. “My dear Luka,” Tesla wrote, “I am, as you know, very fond ofmillionaires, but the inducements you offer are so great that I shall set [them]aside…to partake in the splendid lunch which Mme. Filipov will [prepare]…[For]Christmas, I want to be at home—327 Lexington Avenue—with my friends, my dearfriends—the Johnsons. If you will prepare a dinner for a half dozen and invitenobody, it will suit me…We shall talk of bless[ed] peace and be merry untilthen.”21Tesla did his best to overlook the erotic tension emanating from Katharine asshe directed the servants, with Agnes, to set the dinner table and Tesla talkedshop with Robert and his son, Owen. Katharine could never be part of the bondthat existed between Tesla and Robert. Her heart ached for what it could nothave and yet, simultaneously, was filled with what it now possessed.With Robert out of the room, Katharine was too intense. She claimed a telepathiclink to the wizard, her breast palpitated when he was near, hormones gushed. Onone occasion she edged them to the line. He had no choice but to withdraw.On the last day of the year, Stanford dropped off a note. He wanted Tesla tohire a promising lad, the son of his friend Charley Barney, a banker with tiesto Whitney and Vanderbilt. “My dear Mr. White,” Tesla wrote back, “I heartilyagree that the young fellow who has two awfully pretty sisters, ought to behelped by all means. Unfortunately,” Tesla continued, he still had theresponsibility of “carrying three superfluous [work]men” who were not reallyworking because of the delay caused by the fire.22As the relationship with the Johnsons became more intimate, there may have beenrivalries between them over which one had the greater access to “Him.” Teslawrote after the new year: “My dear Luka, I am glad to know you shall love me,but I am much disappointed to learn that the boil has bothered you so much. Idoubt, however, that you are a hero, because heroes do not go to bed on accountof a boil.”23Although Katharine had seen Tesla twice in December, it only served to igniteher passion even more. Torn between loving a professorial and delightfulgentleman, who could count among his friends Mark Twain, John Muir, RudyardKipling, and Teddy Roosevelt, even if he did suffer from boils, and an exoticinternationally known virtuoso whose singular talents promised to transform anentire world, Katharine wanted “to feel herself en rapport’” with the wizard sothat she could discuss their psychic link:> February 12, 1896> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > I have had such a wonderful experience the past three years.

He would oftendine with women and tantalize with his eyes, but that would have to be theextent of a relationship.Apparently Tesla undertook a self-imposed vow of chastity, having beeninfluenced in part by Swami Vivekananda, who preached chastity as the path toself-transformation and enlightenment.Tesla met the Swami on February 13, 1896, at a dinner with Sarah Bernhardt afterone of her performances in the play Iziel. As with the rest of the world, Teslahad first heard of the Swami during the summer of 1893 when the “Hindoo” gainedovernight prominence after speaking at the Congress of World Religions, whichhad been held at the Chicago World’s Fair. As Tesla had been in Chicago within amonth of the talk, it is conceivable that he met or saw the Swami speak at thattime.Vivekananda told “the great electrician” about “Vendantic Prâna [life force] andAkâsa [ether], which according to [Tesla], are the only theories modern sciencecan entertain.”Having studied Madam Blavatsky’s theosophical teachings, Tesla was alreadyversed in the idea of Akâsa and the Akâshic Records, which are, in essence, therecords of all historical events existing in some vibratory state in this ether.“The Brahmâ, or Universal Mind,” the Swami continued, “produces Akâsa andPrâna.”Tesla agreed with the essential premise of this Buddhist view, replying that thetheory could be “proved mathematically by demonstrating that force and matterare reducible to potential energy,” and then the inventor invited SwamiVivekananda, some of his devotees, and Sarah Bernhardt to his laboratory for thefollowing week to demonstrate through experiments this principle.After Tesla showed the swami some of his “creations,” the swami advised thatpure creation, in the sense that “something” was born from “nothing” was notpossible. To Swami Vivekananda, creation was a process of combining existingelements into a new synthesis. This idea of the eternal nature of existence withno beginning and no ending was appealing to Tesla, and he later referred to thisand related concepts in some of his writings. Today, this theory in cosmologyrefers to the steady-state theory of eternal creation, which would oppose themore generally accepted big-bang theory, which hypothesizes a particular datefor the beginning of time. The reason that the big-bang theory is the moregenerally accepted one is because the universe is expanding. Working backward,it appears logical that all matter in the universe was together at one time inone location. Current estimates place the big bang at about 15 billion yearsago.24How Astor could be taken in by Keely, was a mystery to Tesla, for the financierdeclined at this time to partake in the venture. He had taken a month toconsider the proposal:> January 18, 1896> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > Your letter offering me some of your oscillator stock received…95 seems rather> a high price; for though the inventions covered by the stock will doubtless> bring about great changes, they may not pay for some time as yet, and, of> course, there are always a good many risks.> > Wishing the oscillator as much success as I could if financially interested,> and hoping soon to be able to use one myself,> > [I remain] Yours sincerely,> John Jacob Astor25Although a rejection, the letter was not a complete denial. It was going to takeone or two more go-arounds to land this big fish.The oscillators, for Tesla, of course, were never ends in and of themselves.Tesla’s goal was to send energy into the earth and use it as a conduit totransmit messages and power. Details of the plan, however, were such a tightlyheld secret that even his workers were not completely confided in. Somewhatsurreptitiously, Tesla took a train to Colorado Springs in late February 1896 tolook over a prospective site for a new laboratory and also to conduct the kindsof wireless experiments he had wanted to undertake before his laboratory burnedto the ground. Tesla instructed a colleague, perhaps a local engineeringprofessor, to transmit a musical song on an autoharp through Pikes Peak to hisreceiving equipment, which included another autoharp, attuned to the first, fourmiles away, on the other side of the mountain.The experiment was a success; the song “Ben Bolt,” played on one side of themountain, was picked up by means of a resonant earth frequency on the other.Tesla, however, completely confounded the details of the instrumentationinvolved. By implying to the press that the energy utilized derived from theearth and not from one of his oscillators, Tesla also succeeded in generatinghyperbolic headlines as well.Based on this false premise, page 1 of the March 8, 1896, Sunday magazinesection of the World announced not only Tesla’s historic wireless achievementbut also the supposed experimental verification that the earth was imbued with“free energy” of essentially unlimited amounts. By tapping this reservoir, thefuture was clear: “Electricity would be as free as air…The end has come totelegraph, telephone companies…and other monopolies…with a crash.”"},{"pageContent":"19SHADOWGRAPHS (1896) [002-toc.html#ch19]> The rising claims of the inventors revives an incident in connection with the> discovery of the Roentgen ray…Oliver Lodge [announced] apparatus by which he> saw through a man.

Michael Pupin wrote, “No otherdiscovery within my lifetime had ever aroused the interest of the world as didthe discovery of the X-rays. Every physicist dropped his own problems and rushedheadlong into the research.” Astonishingly, Pupin added, “To the best of myknowledge I was at that time the only physicist here who had had any laboratoryexperience with vacuum-tube research…I obtained the first X-ray photograph inAmerica on January 2, 1896, two weeks after the discovery was announced inGermany.”2 As Pupin could so neatly do, he foreswore any mention of hiscompatriot. To Pupin, Tesla was a nonperson.Roentgen gained world recognition virtually overnight with his announcement thathe had discovered a new energy emanating from cathode-ray tubes that couldilluminate light-sensitive chemicals at the far end of a room, penetrate solidobjects, and photograph the internal organs and bones of living beings. As Pupinnoted, scientists from all over the world dropped their current projects to joinin this exciting new venture. Tesla himself wrote no fewer than nine articles onthe topic in a two-year period. Although Tesla may have noticed these rays andtheir effects on photographic paper years earlier,3 he did not pursue theinvestigations and left no doubt that the discoverer of what he liked to call“shadowgraphs” was Wilhelm Roentgen.Tesla had taken the word “shadowgraph” from Søren Kierkegaard, who describedthem in his essay “Either/Or.” To the existential philosopher they were sketches“that derive from the darker side of life…[but] are not directly visible…The[shadowgraph] does not become perceptible until I see through the external…Notuntil I look through it, do I discover that inner picture too delicately drawnto be outwardly visible, woven as it is of the tenderest moods of the soul.”4In Europe meager X rays were being produced by static machines and Ruhmkorffinduction coils; Tesla suggested, instead, the use of a high-frequencydisruptive coil attached to a special bulb with two electrodes, a cathode insidethe vacuum, for generating the “cathode streams,” and an anode placed as faraway as possible outside the bulb to limit the reduction of the potential. Withthis apparatus, “effective pressures of about 4,000,000 volts were achieved.”5At first, the bulb will get hot and glow with a purplish hue, then the electrodewill disintegrate, and the bulb will cool. Use of a fan helps. “From [this]point on…the bulb is in a very good condition for producing the Roentgenshadows.” When the electrode is too hot, it is probably because the vacuum isnot high enough.6Generating such high voltages, this work not only was set up to measure thequality of the energy emanating from the bulb and to test its ability to pierceliving and nonliving objects or be reflected; it also laid the foundation forTesla’s later experiments with particle-beam weapons.Here, in 1896, Tesla discussed the idea promulgated by the quantum physicists afew years later that the energy had both particle-like and wavelike properties.Having set up a target to shoot the streams at, Tesla wrote: “The effects on thesensitive plate are due to projected particles or else to vibrations [ofextremely high frequencies].”7 The inventor further speculated that “the streamsare formed of matter in some primary or elementary condition…Similiar streamsmust be emitted by the sun and probably by other sources of radiant energy.”8Tesla also appeared to have come close to the idea of breaking up the electroninto subatomic particles. “The projected lumps of matter act as inelasticbodies, similarly to ever so many small lead bullets…These lumps are shatteredinto fragments so small as to make them lose entirely some physical propertiespossessed before the impact…[Might it not be possible] that in the Roentgenphenomena we may witness a transformation of ordinary matter into ether?9 [Or]we may be confronted with a dissolution of matter into some unknown primaryform, the Akâsa of the old Vedas.”10The inventor as physicist then proceeded to take X rays of small animals, suchas birds and rabbits, as well as his workers, and of his own skull, ribs, limbs,and vertebrae. As some shadowgraphs took as long as an hour to obtain, Teslanoticed that he would sometimes fall asleep while he was being bombarded by themachine.Week after week, Tesla would crank out yet another article on his “LatestResults.” On March 18, 1896, he announced in Electrical Review that he hadproduced shadowgraphs of humans at distances of forty feet and affectedphotosensitive paper at a distance of sixty feet from the source of the rays.The inventor also tested different metals to see which ones reflected the energyin the best way. Adorned with a lavish X ray of the bones of the wizard’s ownrib cage, the article conveyed an eerie impression.11“I told some friends,” Tesla wrote, “that it might be possible to observe by theaid of [a]…screen objects [and skeletons] passing through a street…I mentionthis odd idea only as an illustration of how these scientific developments mayeven affect our morals and customs. Perhaps we shall shortly get used to thisstate of things.”For Tesla, Roentgen rays were a gateway to a world invisible and ripe for newpossibilities. “Roentgen gave us a [wonderful] gun to fire…projecting missilesof a thousandfold greater penetrative power than that of a cannon ball, andcarrying them probably to distances of many miles…These missiles are so smallthat we may fire them through our tissues for days, weeks, and years, apparentlywithout hurtful consequence.”Throughout the year, the inventor suffered from “the grippe.” Although hisillness made the papers, nobody seemed to link it to his excessiveexperimentation with the mysterious energy. In fact, concerning the risk toone’s health, Tesla wrote: “No experimenter need be deterred from…investigationof Roentgen rays for fear of poisonous or generally deleterious action, for itseems reasonable to conclude that it would take centuries to accumulate enoughof such matter to interfere seriously with the process of life of a person.”12We now know, of course, that this view is wrong as long-term exposure to X rayscan be very dangerous to one’s health.Tesla did, however, refer to pain in the center of his forehead whenexperimenting with the rays and to “the hurtful action on the skin, inflammationand blistering,” but this he attributed to the production of ozone, which insmall quantities was “a most beneficial disinfectant.” Nevertheless, there was asevere accident in the lab “to a dear and zealous assistant…without a protectivescreen present. The worker suffered severe blistering and raw flesh exposed,”the inventor undertaking “the bitter duty of recording the accident” in order tolessen the danger for others.”13Edison was also making headlines with his work with Roentgen rays, especiallywhen he noted that the streams caused blind people to experience sensations intheir eyes. “The X-rays succeeded in eliciting from the blind the ejaculation,“I see; yes, I see a light!”14Edison, whose fluoroscope was already being used for lighting the eye during eyesurgery, saw the possibility that eyesight, in some way, might be restored withthe use of X rays.15 Tesla doubted it, and so the press took up the charge andcreated a new round of headlines placing the two pioneers once again againsteach other. “The humorless dark Hungarian [had the] unpleasant duty to say, ‘Isit not cruel to raise such hopes when there is so little ground for it…Whatpossible good can result?’”16Time proved Edison wrong, as X rays have not been used to “stimulate the retina”in such a way as to restore sight, but the two wizards did perform a number ofsuccessful miracles with the strange energy when each used the instruments tolocate bullets lodged in the bones of various patients. Fortunately, theKentucky School of Medicine helped bring the battle between the two to a closewhen they “combin[ed] the devices of Tesla and Edison” to extract bird shot fromthe wounded foot of a voter who had received the injury in a fight at anelection poll. After developing the X ray, which took only ninety seconds tomake, “every bone was distinctly shown, and the shot, about thirty in number,were plainly located.”17To celebrate the triumph and quell any purported hostilities, T. C. Martin wasable to coax Tesla into joining Edison and a number of other electricians for aday of fishing on a topsail schooner off Sandy Hook. The event was sponsored bythe Safety Insulated Wire and Cable Company. Although a storm erupted,accompanied by dark clouds and lightning, the “bold fishermen were undismayed…Instately grandness…as happy and well satisfied a party as ever rode the waves ofthe Atlantic’s billows…Toward nightfall, the [ship] turned her prowhomeward…Nicola Tesla [caught] a flounder of large dimensions…[and] Edisoncaught a shocking big fluke.”18"},{"pageContent":"20FALLS SPEECH (1897) [002-toc.html#ch20]> Nikola Tesla said much in a notable speech at a banquet to celebrate the> conveyance of power from Niagara to Buffalo.

He traveled with George Westinghouse, Edward Dean Adams,William Rankine, and Comdr. George Melville of the U.S. Navy. Also present wasThomas Ely, supervisor of motive power for the Pennsylvania Railroad. Tesla wasimportant to all five for almost as many reasons.A reporter for the Niagara Gazette greeted them upon their arrival. “Tesla is anidealist,” the journalist wrote, “fully six feet tall, very dark of complexion,nervous and wirey. Impressionable maidens would fall in love with him at firstsight, but he has no time to think of impressionable maidens. In fact, he hasgiven as his opinion that inventors should never marry. Day and night he isworking away at some deep problems that fascinate him, and anyone that talkswith him for only a few minutes will get the impression that science is his onlymistress and that he cares more for her than for money and fame.”Rankine predicted that Buffalo would receive electrical power by November, andWestinghouse predicted that costs would be cheaper than steam. “You could say itwill cost one half what steam power cost[s],” Rankine added in support.“Mr. Tesla, what is your opinion of the effect of this development of power onBuffalo and Niagara Falls?”“The effect will be that both cities will stretch out their arms until theymeet.”2Tesla looked up at the roaring cataract overcome with emotion as he and theothers donned their rain gear before entering the mighty wonder. He had grown upjust fifty miles from the magnificent maze of cascading flumes known as PlitviceLakes, but those were Lilliputian compared to this thundering colossus. Prideovercame the inventor as he trailed behind for a few moments to think, as he sooften did, of his mountain homeland. It had been four years since he had seenhis family, fifteen years since his first successful construction of a turbinethat could be driven by waterpower, and nearly thirty-five years since he hadtold his uncle of his dream of one day harnessing Niagara Falls. Humbled by thisawesome manifestation of nature, he sat for a moment to reflect as he watchedhis cohorts disappear along the catwalks into a mist of rainbows.“Let’s go, Mr. Tesla,” Adams called out, having waited as patiently as he could,for the next stop on the itinerary was the Edward Dean Adams Hydro-ElectricPower Station, the first of two that would be built in his name. Designed byStanford White, the edifice housed nearly a dozen gargantuan Tesla turbines,capable of generating collectively over 35,000 kilowatts. The men appeared likedwarfs sauntering amid a lustrous gadgetry assembled as if by giants—one longrow of towering, kettleshaped engines. From this chamber, an efficient,nonpolluting, never-ending source of electrical energy was about to be generatedcapable of driving the factories and illuminating the streets and homes ofnearly one-fourth of the entire continent. The echoes of their steps faded asthey stood for a moment in silence in the chapel of the dawning New Age.Upon his return to New York, Tesla found a letter from Sir William Preece.3 Ayoung man, half British, on his mother’s side, and half Italian, had stopped byPreece’s office with a wireless Morse-code apparatus based on the work ofHeinrich Hertz. Guglielmo Marconi, just twenty-two years old, had brought anotebook which reviewed the literature in the field (most likely the writings ofHertz, Lodge, and Tesla). Marconi had chosen wisely, as Preece was head of theBritish Post Office and had experimented himself in testing induction effectsthrough the ground from telegraph lines.4“After the experiments with the classical Hertz devices under the auspices ofthe Imperial Post Office in England,” Tesla reported many years later, “Preecewrote me a letter conveying the information that the tests had been abandoned asof no value, but he believed good results [would be possible by my system]. Inreply, I offered to prepare two sets for trial and asked him to give me thetechnical particulars necessary to the design. Just then, Marconi came out withthe emphatic assertion that he had tried out my apparatus and that it did notwork. Evidently he succeeded in his purpose, for nothing was done in regard tomy proposal.”5 Tesla’s first patent specifically for wireless transmission wasfiled a year later, on September 2, 1897 (no. 650,353).The following month, in August 1896, Tesla received a histrionic plea fromKatharine, who was vacationing with her family at a cottage in Bar Harbor,Maine. Wanting desperately for Tesla to join them, she could only allude to herwish.> August 6, 1896> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > I am so troubled about you. I hear you are ill…Leave work for a while.

The rumor is that you have melted in your laboratory.”7Perhaps Katharine was right, for Tesla was unavailable to the Johnsons even upontheir return. Tesla was also ignoring letters from his sisters from Croatia,particularly Marica, who, much like Katharine, asked him why he would notrespond. Roentgen rays had been left behind many months ago, but he was stillgaunt from illness and overwork. Now he was in a wireless race against newcomerslike Marconi. Fearing that his invention would be pirated, Tesla’s lab became amore mysterious place.> November 7, 1896> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > It may seem presumptuous [for] a stranger to address you, but Mrs. Johnson,> (my wife) whom you may remember having met, cannot refrain from uniting with> me in congratulating you on the success of the Buffalo experiment…If this> seems taking too great a liberty with one whom we know so slightly, I trust> you will attribute it to our interest in the progress of humanity.> > Respectively yours,> Robert Underwood Johnson8Tesla’s holiday spirit prevailed, and he joined his beloved Johnsons forChristmas dinner, apologizing for being so distant by bringing Mrs. Filipov anexquisite bouquet of flowers.The celebration of the inauguration of the Niagara power station was held at theEllicott Club in Buffalo in the midst of winter’s most dangerous month.Fortunately, the weather was permitting, and 350 of the nation’s most prominentbusinessmen made the January trek. Hosted by Morgan’s advance man, Francis LyndeStetson, a law partner of Grover Cleveland’s, the list of attendees included averitable who’s who of commerce. Curiously missing from the event, althoughinvited, were such notables as John Jacob Astor, J. Pierpont Morgan, and ThomasAlva Edison.“Mr. Stetson spoke of the pall of smoke hanging over Buffalo and said that theday should come when power would come from Niagara and not from smoke andsteam…The introduction of Nikola Tesla, the greatest electrician on earth,produced a monstrous ovation. The guests sprang to their feet and wildly wavednapkins and cheered for the famous scientist. It was three or four minutesbefore quiet prevailed.”9A constellation of psychological peculiarities accompanied the wizard’s lecture.He began in a self-deprecating manner: “I have scarcely had courage enough toaddress an audience on a few unavoidable occasions…Even now as I speak…thefugitive conceptions will vanish, and I shall experience certain well knownsensations of abandonment, chill and silence. I can see already yourdisappointed countenances and can read in them the painful regret of the mistakeof your choice.”10Why did Tesla “poison the well” with this dreadful opening? A deep sense ofinferiority appears evident and yet Tesla was also completely aware that thisdinner was in his honor and was therefore the pinnacle of his life to date—andthrough him an apotheosis for the whole of humanity. Why didn’t he simplycongratulate himself or accept praise well deserved? We see here the firsttangible manifestation of an overpowering feeling of inferiority, a clear-cutself-destructive element in his nature. The dark legacy of a deep-seatedrepression flooded through his veins, like a hydra about to annihilate.Nevertheless, it was his inventions that would change an entire world. It wasthe name Nikola Tesla which appeared a dozen times on the patent plaque of hisnew system. It was Nikola Tesla who was praised with “wild enthusiasm” by thecorporate and engineering intellegentsia. And it was Nikola Tesla who changed,in precise and measurable ways, the very direction humanity was taking. This wasa moment of anointment; through his specific action, the evolution of the raceand the texture of an entire planet would be permanently changed in a positiveway.Yet at this moment of the fulfillment of his greatest wish, a deep neuroticconstellation was also triggered. From the psychoanalytic perspective, Teslacould now repay his family for the death of his brother by symbolically bringingthe brother back to life—and, on the larger scale, give the world a new life,his AC polyphase system. But the shadow had its hold, and he was simply unableto accept the happiness of the moment without throwing a monkey wrench into it.His speech went on: “These remarks, gentleman, are not made with the selfishdesire of winning your kindness and indulgence of my shortcomings, but with thehonest intention of offering you an apology for your disappointment…But I amhopeful that in my formless and incomplete statements…there may be something ofinterest…benefiting this unique occasion.”11Tesla’s unconscious plan, the heart and soul of his neurosis, was to completelyundermine himself by downgrading the Niagara endeavor. It is possible thatStetson had read the speech on the train ride up to Buffalo and foresaw thetragic consequences, as it appears that he waited for a propitious moment to cutthe tail end off.Now that Tesla had arrived, he began to see himself as more than a mereinventor. He was a creator, not of great paintings or of great musicalcompositions but of great technologies. Niagara Falls was but a steppingstone tothe larger plan. His speech went on to pay homage to the “philanthropic spirit”of the businessman, and the great contribution of the scientist. Tesla alsohailed such individuals as arc lighting designer Charles Brush, vacuum tubeinventor Philip Lenard, and railroad engine designer Frank Sprague as well asWilhelm Roentgen, Lord Rayleigh, Elihu Thomson, Thomas Edison, and GeorgeWestinghouse. “All of these men and many more are untiringly at workinvestigating new regions and opening up unsuspected and promising fields.”> Among all these many departments of research, there is one which is of the> greatest significance for the comfort and existence, of mankind, and that is> the electrical transmission of power…We have many a monument of past ages> exemplif[ying] the greatness of nations, the power of men, the love of art and> religious devotion. But that monument at Niagara has something of its own,> worthy of our scientific age, a true monument of enlightenment and of peace.> It signifies the subjugation of natural forces to the service of man, the> discontinuance of barbarous methods, the relieving of millions from want and> suffering…Power is our mainstay, the primary source of our many-sided> energies.12Stetson saw his moment and returned to the stage to whisper in Tesla’s ear. “Iam just informed,” Tesla suddenly announced, “that in three minutes we have toleave…What can I say? (Cries of ‘No.’)…I can congratulate the courageouspioneers who have embarked in this enterprise and carried it to success.Buffalonians, I would say friends, let me congratulate you on the wonderfulexpanse of possibilities opened and let me wish that in no time distant yourcity will be a worthy neighbor of the great cataract which is one of the greatwonders of nature.”13 There was a train to catch. The rest of the speech wouldbe published in the electrical journals.It was a fortuitous break. For here we see a positive statement concerning thestupendous achievement at Niagara, and we also see the seeds of a new visionTesla was planting for the world. He was not a mechanic but an artist. Monetarygain was not an end; in fact, the providing of cheap power for the masses was agoal. Businessmen were not greedy capitalists but noble philanthropists. Thiswas a utopian dream which perhaps one day might come true. And as we shall see,it was also a justification, maybe even a rationalization, for some of theaudacious ways Tesla chose to spend the “contributions” of the financiers whocame to support his Promethean campaign.Playing the “Master Game” Tesla was gambling for all the stakes. His goal was noless than the ability to transform himself into a deity. This, as O’Neillwrites, was his “superman complex.”> We shall not satisfy ourselves simply with improving [present day methods], we> have a greater task to fulfill to evolve means for obtaining energy from> stores which are forever inexhaustible, to perfect methods which do not imply> consumption and waste of any material whatever…[I have] examined for a long> time the possibilities of operat[ing] engines on any point of the earth by the> energy of the medium [and] am glad to say that I have devised means which has> given me fresh hope that I shall see the fulfillment of one of my fondest> dreams; namely, the transmission of power from station to station without the> employment of any connecting wire.14Tesla had audaciously proclaimed in the written and published part of his speechthat this great enterprise which they were about to usher in (and the one westill use a century later) was already obsolete! He had a better plan. There wasno need for the millions of telephone poles that were to be erected, no need forthe megatons of copper that would have to go into an endless array ofinterconnected power lines, no need for the enormous production of rubber forinsulation or for the tens of thousands of acres required to support the system,and no need for the workmen who were soon to be hired to maintain the equipment,for all of this, the transmission of electrical power, light, and information,could be achieved without wires. No wonder Stetson cut Tesla short.This speech was the pivotal moment in Tesla’s career. He set out full force toachieve this end. Nothing but death would stop him in his attempts to realizethe dream."},{"pageContent":"21LUMINARIES (1896-98) [002-toc.html#ch21]> A memorable occasion was the first meeting of Tesla and Paderewski.

C. Martin, Francis Lynde Stetson,Darius Ogden Mills, and John Hays Hammond’s brother, Richard Hammond, who wasconsidering placing Tesla turbines at a dam in California. A Roentgen symposiumwas being coordinated by Martin and R. U. Johnson under the auspices of theCentury, and Tesla would help in the preparations, but disagreements with TomEdison, Elihu Thomson, and Michael Pupin had peaked, and Tesla declined aninvitation to a dinner of all the participants. “I can not explain, but it isreally impossible for me to join the company,”2 he said.Edison was about to join forces with Marconi. Thomson was still pirating Tesla’sinduction motor; Pupin, the Tesla oscillators. Stetson, as Morgan’s “attorneygeneral,” could smooth over the bumps in GE’s attempts to lay the groundwork fora pooling of patents with Westinghouse—GE would get the AC polyphase system inexchange for the Vanderpoel trolley patents—but he could never erase the growingvendetta against Tesla by a number of key men in his industry.This was a particularly difficult time for Martin and so a gap between Martinand Tesla began to form.At the end of January, Tesla sponsored another lavish feast followed by a tourof his lab. He invited John Jacob Astor and his stunning wife, Ava Willing, andMr. and Mrs. Stanford White. Due to the late hour, Lady Astor was “dreadfullydisappointed” to pass on the electrical pyrotechnics.3 However, White andcompany were able to take advantage of the entire affair.“My dear Tesla,” wrote White, “I cannot tell you how impressed I was the othernight at your laboratory, and how delighted I was to be there.” Signing theletter “Affectionately yours,” White also congratulated Tesla on his “address atBuffalo…[which was] so full of beautiful thoughts.”4 This was White’s secondvisit to the lab, and his feelings for Tesla continued to grow.> March 28, 1896> > Dear Luka,> > I happen to be free this evening.

If you have Paderewski, Roentgen or Mrs. Anthony I will come.> > Yours sincerely,> TGI5“Tesla Great Inventor” had met Paderewski for the first time at a dinner at theJohnson “salon” in April of 1896. After an invitation from Robert, Tesla wroteback, “Hope that Miss—I mean Mr. Paderewski will come.”6 He was referring toPaderewski’s trademark, a lush, unbridled mane which flared above his head as heplayed the piano during his concerts.Referring to this first meeting, Johnson wrote, “Like Tesla, he [Paderewski] hasa marvelous mind, which is a store-house of knowledge on all sorts of topics.”Johnson, who had written a poem about the virtuoso, likened Paderewski’s musicto “choiring angels in Paradise.”7Latter-day prime minister of Poland, Paderewski was the highest-paid performerof the decade. Richard Watson Gilder, editor in chief at the Century, frequentlyinvited, in Paderewski’s words, “all the great visiting artists, musicians,distinguished writers, sculptors, painters and politicans who came to America…Aconnoisseur of art and of life, [Gilder] appreciated and recognized at once theunusual in everything—in people as well.”8 Through Gilder, Johnson met manyluminaries, and through Johnson, Tesla followed.At this same time, in the spring of 1896, Tesla and the Johnsons were busyreading Rudyard Kipling’s recently published Jungle Book. “The stories ofKipling’s are charm itself,” Tesla wrote Mrs. Filipov. “I think Rikki Tikki Taviis the best.”9 Two days later, a party for Kipling was organized at the Johnsonhome. “Sorry I can not come to dinner,” Tesla wrote, “but will show up as soonas possible afterwards.”10Kipling, who was thirty at the time, had purchased a house from hisbrother-in-law in Brattleboro, Vermont, where he had written The Jungle Book,and now he had come to New York to help promote it.Much like Twain, Kipling was known as a “globe-trotter,” having visited suchplaces as Ceylon, India, New Zealand, and Australia. After the party, and hisstay in New York, Kipling traveled to England and then on to South Africa. Onthe boat trip over he ran into John Hays Hammond, and when he reached Cape Town,he talked Cecil Rhodes into giving him a tour of the front lines of the BoerWar. Upon his return to New York, in early 1899, he spent time with Tesla beforeanother formal dinner in his honor was prepared by the Johnsons. The followingletter, although written three years later, reflects the kind of friendship thetwo men shared:> Dear Mrs. Filipov,> > What is the matter with inkspiller Kipling? He actually dared to invite me to> dine in an obscure hotel where I would be sure to get hair and cockroaches in> the soup?11On the very day of the party, Kipling rocked the world, for he was taken illwith typhoid and nearly died. Katharine would spend the next few months helpingto take care of the ailing novelist.12 Kipling survived the ordeal, buttragically, his daughter Josephine perished. He was in such a weakened conditionthat his wife was forced to hide the young girl’s death from him until he waswell enough to be able to handle the news. As the newspapers carried dailyreports of Kipling’s condition on their front pages, the world mourned the younggirl’s loss, just as they rejoiced with his recovery. Having experienced familytragedy in his own life, Tesla hoped that the death would not impair Kipling’sability to write. “I am delighted Kipling has recovered,” Tesla told theJohnsons. “I just hope there will be no evil consequences except a sorrow thoughhard to bear.” Philosophically, Tesla added, “It will probably give his worksmore dignity and depth.”13> Do not thus drift with the mob.

Sixty years old, still in his prime, his hair was gray andlong and his face adorned with a beard that extended to his navel like scraggysagebrush. His eyes may have sparked in different directions because of an earlyindustrial accident, but his gaze proclaimed the aura of an enlightened one.Having dined with Muir at the Johnsons’ during the holiday season, and havinginvited the naturalist back to his lab, Tesla later told Katharine, that heappreciated Muir’s contribution to society. “I am always grateful to [Muir],” hewrote, “for his magnificent description of Yosemite Valley which I have readthrough in one breath.”15A founder of the Sierra Club with Johnson, Muir was, in a sense, Tesla’sdoppelgänger. Muir was a somewhat unkempt naturalist who spent most of his timein the forest, but part of him longed for civilization, and Tesla, ever thefastidious and smartly dressed metropolitan, spent most of his life in the citybut longed for the mountains. A former inventor himself, having fashioned anaward-winning bed that toppled the sleeper out onto the floor in the morning,Muir was not opposed, in principle, to human progress, only to callousobliteration of the precious wonders of the planet. Since Tesla’s inventionssought to utilize renewable energy and minimize destruction of naturalresources, in that sense, both Tesla and Muir shared a common end.Muir’s writings remain his most powerful statement to the spiritual path. Theimportance of his friendship with Tesla helps support the modern-conceptsconservation and ecological thinking. Placing it all in perspective, Muir wrote,“Who wouldn’t be a mountaineer! Up here all the world’s prizes seem nothing.”16"},{"pageContent":"22SORCERER’S APPRENTICE (1896-97) [002-toc.html#ch22]> Tesla had his rooms in the laboratory on Houston Street darkened [and] a> current was turned on invisibly.

Tesla’s writingsare “the greatest exciters to zealous work and study,” De Forest wrote in hisdiary. “His New York laboratory [is] a fabulous domain into which all ambitiousyoung electrical students aspire…to enter and there remain…How I pray that I mayequal or excel him, that all this belief in my genius is not idle and conceit.”In May 1896, De Forest was able to arrange a visit to the East Houston Streetden. “Now is the critical point in the curve of my life,” the youth scribbled onhis pad as he sat on the train waiting for his stop, “for I am about to seekwork with Nikola Tesla.”The expert greeted the novice and gave him a tour, but was unable to take him onas an apprentice. Noticing the dejected countenance on the budding inventor’sface Tesla told De Forest: “I see a great future for you as you are endowed witha keen mind. You will not need this job to succeed.” Tesla wished him well andsuggested De Forest contact him again.De Forest would apply once more in the spring of 1898, and probably again in1900 or 1901, but for various reasons he was never hired. In retrospect, Tesla’sdecision to reject the talented engineer was unfortunate, for De Forest wouldsoon rise to a premier position as a pioneer in the field of wirelesscommunication. He had a commercial mind and became a tenacious rival to Tesla’sother young competitor, Guglielmo Marconi.2Throughout 1896, Tesla applied for and received eight patents on his wirelesssystem. These were mostly different types of oscillators for generatingelectromagnetic currents of high frequency and high potential. His firstapplication specifically in the field of radio communication was in 1897; hissecond, remote control, in 1898. Earlier patents on oscillators dating back to1891 and 1893 also covered this work, though in veiled form. Over the next fiveyears, the inventor’s arsenal grew to thirty-three fundamental patents, coveringall essential areas of “transmitting electrical energy through the naturalmedium.”3As part of his overall scheme, Tesla also began working on perfecting a systemof telephotography. His interest could be traced to 1893 and the Chicago World’sFair, where Elisha Gray’s teleautographic machine was displayed. But over thesummer of 1896 competition peaked, especially when Edison announced his plans tomarket an “autographic telegraph.” “I’m getting it ready for you newspaperfellows,” Edison said, “and when I get working, all you will have to do is handyour copy to the operator say in New York, for example, the cover will be shutdown and presto! the wires will transmit it letter for letter to the machine atthe other end in Buffalo. The wires will transmit 20 square inches of copy aminute and will carry sketches and pictures as well.”4In attempts to outdo Edison, Tesla told the New York Herald of his own advances.Under the imaginative assumptions that images from the retina could be capturedand transmitted, Tesla included this esoteric idea along with a more realisticplan to transmit text and pictures over the phone lines and by wireless.5Even today, the facsimile machine holds a special place in our imagination, forsomething typed in an office in New York can be transmitted instantaneously bysatellite or over the phone lines to a receiver in San Francisco, Moscow, orTokyo. One can only imagine the sense of disbelief facing Tesla as he tried toconvince readers that pictures could be sent by means of wireless from one cityto another. Even primitive Morse-coded messages had yet to really be effectivelytransmitted.Nevertheless, Marconi was closing in rapidly on successfully demonstrating hiswireless apparatus as Tesla scoured the libraries to study the history oftelephotography.Tesla traced early work in inventions that led to the development of thefacsimile machine and television to English physicist Alexander Bain, who, in1842, first transmitted pictures by using a grid of electrical wires imbedded inwax held firmly beneath a sheet of chemically treated paper. All of these wirescould be channeled into one cable and strung to a receiving station where anidentical grid was constructed. If the receiver traced out the letter A, forinstance, with an electric stylus, the particular wires comprising the design ofthe letter would be electrified, and these, in turn, would treat that area ofthe paper on the receiving end to spell out the matching character. Autographsand drawings could also be transmitted in the same manner. As the processevolved, pictures could be broken down into a finite number of picture elementsso that they could also be dispatched. In the 1860s, this grid was replaced by asingle wire through the implementation of spinning disks and “perfectsynchronism between transmitter and receiver,” Tesla’s synchronous AC motorhelping augment the procedure in the late 1880s and early 1890s.6With the development of the photographic process, the first wireless pictureswere sent in 1898 by Küster and G. Williams, “but the arrangements involved theemployment of Hertz waves and were impractable.” In 1892, Tesla recalled manyyears later, “the attention of the scientific world was directed to awonderfully sensitive receiver, consisting of an electron stream maintained in adelicately balanced condition in a vacuum bulb, by means of which it wasproposed to use photography in the transmission of telegraphic and telephonicmessages through the Atlantic cables, and later also by wireless.”In 1904, Dr. Arthur Korn, an electrical engineer from the University of Munich,gained the attention of the scientific community when he successfullytransmitted wire photos from Munich to Nuremburg. According to Korn, who isoften credited as the inventor of the television tube, the apparatus utilized“Tesla currents.”7 Tesla notes that once Korn introduced “a sensitive place[and] a selenium cell to vary the intensity of the sending current,” the processwhich is called the television advanced a giant step. Korn’s “tube is excited bya high-frequency current supplied from a Tesla transformer and may be flashed upmany thousand times per second,” thereby attaining the moving television image.8Tesla dates Korn’s first experiments to 1903. A May 1899 article states thatTesla was working on a “visual telegraphy” system with the light-sensitiveelement selenium, thus predating Korn’s work by four years. It is probable thatTesla was replicating the experiments of Küster and Williams on precursors tothe video camera, although Korn, not Tesla, perfected it.9In essence, the modern television works in a way analogous to Bain’s first 1842construction. An electronic tube, similar to Tesla’s brush vacuum tube, is movedacross an entire TV screen in an instant. During its pass over the area wherethe image is formed, it releases synchronized impulses for each pixel. Theposition of the beam and its precise sequence of firing are directed by impulsesstemming from the broadcast station. Each pass over the entire screen creates aseparate image that when played in sequence portrays natural moving pictures.Tesla followed the advances in the field of telephotography as they occurred andexperimented himself. His first task was to figure out the optimal way totransmit the energy.Having tested the Hertz spark-gap apparatus, Tesla found that this device, whichMarconi was utilizing, was subject to static interference and involved arbitrarypulsed (damped) frequencies that were weak. They transmitted themselvestransversely through the air and did not take into account longitudinalproperties which were augmented when making use of extremely high potentials anda ground connection. Working out calculations that took into account the speedof light and the size of the earth, Tesla designed carefully constructedcontinuous (undamped) electromagnetic waves that were in harmony with those ofthe planet.By 1897, Tesla amassed all of the essential patents for generating, modulating,storing, transmitting, and receiving wireless impulses. In a letter to hislawyer, Parker W. Page, Tesla wrote, “I forward herewith M. Marconi’s patentwhich was just allowed…I notice that the signals have been described as beingdue to Hertzian waves, which is not the case. In other words, the patentdescribes something entirely different than what actually takes place…How fardoes this affect the validity of the patent?”10 Clearly, Tesla already suspectedthat Marconi was utilizing his equipment.In Tesla’s first patent specifically for wireless transmission, no. 649,621,filed on September 2, 1897, he discusses the need for a “terminal…preferably oflarge surface…maintained by such means as a balloon at an elevation suitable forthe purposes of transmission…[and another] terminal of the secondary…connectedto [the] earth…At the receiving station a transformer of similar construction isemployed.” The specification goes on to describe how the wavelengths can beconstructed and modified so as to tune the circuits and take into account thenatural properties of electromagnetic energy.Having taken into account the size and capacity of the earth, Tesla hadcalculated that with a coil fifty miles in length oscillating at 925 times persecond, a resonant relationship to the frequency of light was realized. Since hehad worked with exhausted tubes, Tesla knew that electricity traveled moreeasily through them than through air. Thus, he reasoned, if his transmissiontowers were placed on high elevations above obstructions and further raised bythe use of balloons, the upper atmosphere (or ionosphere) itself would serve asa means of transmission. Large power stations located near waterfalls wouldsupply the energy necessary for the wireless transmission to this upperstratum.11image 3 [images/image-03.jpg]In a separate way, the earth itself would also serve as a medium. The followingpassage from the same 1897 patent application criticized Marconi’s use of themore primitive Hertzian apparatus: “It is to be noted that the phenomenon hereinvolved in the transmission of electrical energy is one of true conduction andis not to be confounded with the phenomena of electrical radiation which haveheretofore been observed and which from the very nature and mode of propagationwould render practically impossible the transmission of any appreciable amountof energy to such distance as are of practical importance.”12Marconi, who was working with Lloyds of London in ship-to-shore experiments, wasusing a more trial and error method. In July 1896, in experiments with Preece,the Italian had successfully transmitted messages through walls and overdistances of seven or eight miles. In December he applied for a patent, whichPreece felt was “very strong,”13 although he knew the youngster had beenanticipated by Lodge and Tesla. The patent was not original, and it did not putforth any new principles; nevertheless, Marconi was definitely succeeding in thereal world, while Tesla advanced in his laboratory in refinements of apparatusand in the theoretical realm. The differences in sophistication of knowledge onthe subject are aptly described by one of Marconi’s associates, Mr. Vyvyan. “Weknew nothing then about the effect of the length of a wave transmitted governingthe distance over which communication could be affected,” the colleague stated.“We did not even have the means or instruments for measuring wave-length, infact we did not know accurately what wave-length we were using.”14Preece’s initial work in his study of earth currents and induction effectsgenerating from normal telegraphic lines in the 1880s and 1890s led him torealize the strength of Tesla’s system. Marconi, at that stage, had nounderstanding of the role of the earth in conveying electrical energy. He wasutilizing the principle of “radiation” through the air according to Hertz’sapparatus. Without understanding why, he did make use of an aerial and groundconnection, but this setup had already been published widely in 1893 by Tesla.Other principles were taken from Oliver Lodge, who was in a patent dispute withGuglielmo Marconi. William Preece was well aware that they had been anticipated,but he could also see Marconi advance markedly, while his precursors basicallystood still.After Marconi rejected Preece’s suggestion that they request the use of Tesla’sapparatus, the British nobleman was placed in a conflictual situation. In August1897 he mailed off a “terse” dispatch. “I regret to say that I must stop allexperiments and all action until I learn the conditions that are to determinethe relations between your company and the [British] Government Departments whohave encouraged and helped you so much.”15 But the die was cast, and Preecebecame helpless to stop what he knew was a complex form of piracy. He became illand retreated to Egypt, where he stayed a year.Marconi was also being aided by H. M. Hozier, director of Lloyds, who, accordingto one account, “succeeded in sending reasonably clear messages…[throughHozier’s apparatus]…in one place, at least where Marconi himself had failed.”16Lloyds also contacted Tesla “to rig up a wireless set, ship-shore in 1896 toreport the international yacht race, [but] Tesla refused the offer, claimingthat any public demonstration of his system on less than a world-wide basiswould be confused with the amateurish effort being made by otherexperimenters.”17Instead, Tesla performed a long-distance clandestine experiment which he told noone about, not even his workers. Sometime in 1896 or early 1897, the inventorturned on his generator to “produce continuous trains of oscillations” and tooka cab to the Hudson River. There he caught a boat and ferried up to West Pointwith a battery-operated machine “suitable for transportation.” “I did this twoor three times,” he told the courts in 1915. “[But] there were no signalsactually given. I simply got the note, but that was for me just the same.” Inother words, having brought a receiving instrument with him, the inventor simplytuned it to the point where it began to respond to the oscillations emanatingfrom his laboratory back at East Houston Street. “That is, I think, a distanceof about thirty miles,” Tesla said.18Tesla also considered harnessing wind power, the tides, solar and geothermalenergy, and also energy released during the process of electrolysis. If waterwas separated into oxygen and hydrogen, these explosive substances couldtheoretically be used to generate the heat to create steam. Working alongvarying lines of research, Tesla also patented ozone-production machines anddevised a scheme whereby nitrogen from the air would be electrically separatedout and blended with conveyor belts of soil to create a fertilizer machine.“All the agriculturist needs,” Tesla suggested, “is…[to] shovel…a quantity ofloose earth, treated by a secret chemical preparation in liquid form…into thecylinder. An electric current is passed through the confined atmosphere, theoxygen and hydrogen are…expelled, and the nitrogen which remains is thusabsorbed into the loose earth. There is thus produced as strong fertiliser for anominal price [right] at [the farmer’s] home.”19On April 6, 1897, Tesla spoke again to the public at the New York Academy ofSciences. Over four thousand people attended.20 With large photographs of dozensof radio tubes Tesla had designed gracing the walls, Tesla set out to explainhis advances in Roentgen rays. Certainly the audience was interested in seeing aremarkable device that revealed the human skeleton of a living person, butunquestionably most of them came to behold the sorcerer hurl his thunderbolts.21Tesla’s world telegraphy system had finally come into clear focus. His plan wasto disturb the electrical capacity of the earth with gigantic Tesla oscillatorsand thereby use these earth currents themselves as carrier waves for histransmitter. In 1897 he explained precisely how his world telegraphy systemwould operate:> Suppose the whole earth to be like a hollow rubber ball filled with water, and> at one place I have a tube attached…with a plunger…If I press upon the plunger> the water in the tube will be driven into the rubber ball, and as the water is> practically incompressible, every part of the surface of the ball will be> expanded. If I withdraw the plunger, the water follows it and every part of> the ball will contract. Now, if I pierce the surface of the ball several times> and set tubes and plungers at each place, the plungers in these will vibrate> up and down in answer to every movement which I may produce in the plunger of> the first tube.There is a peculiar addition to this paragraph: “If I were to produce anexplosion in the centre of the body of water in the ball, this would set up aseries of vibrations in the whole body. If I could then set the plunger in oneof the tubes to vibrating in consonance with the vibrations of the water, in alittle while and with the use of a very little energy, I could burst the wholething asunder.”The water corresponds to “terrestrial currents” (which are today known astelluric currents), and the plungers refer to his transmitters and receivers.“The inventor thinks it possible that his machine when perfected may be set up,one in each great centre of civilization, to flash the news of the day’s orhour’s history immediately to all other cities of the world; and stepping for asentence out of the realms of the workaday world, he offers a prophecy that anycommunication we may have with other stars will certainly be by such amethod.”22This article, which appeared in Scribners, also discussed Marconi’s successfulwireless transmission of eight miles in Europe. We see in these passagesstemming from 1896 and 1897, that Tesla had already conceived of a total planfor his world telegraphy system and that it utilized a variety of wirelessmodes, one being through the upper air strata, another by means of mechanicalresonance, which he called telegeodynamics, and a third, and his most important,by riding terrestrial currents. His next plan was to measure precisely thefrequency of the planet and construct transmitters in harmonic relations to it.Nodal points could then be mapped out from, say, a wireless transmitter placedat Niagara Falls to precise positions for receiving towers on differentcontinents.For all intents and purposes, no one, except for Marconi, had demonstrated thatwireless messages could be transmitted more than a few hundred feet. And successonly involved the modest goal of sending Morse coded messages. Marconi’s nextplan, which would capture the world’s attention, was to radiate the impulsesacross the English Channel. Certainly Tesla had demonstrated all of theprinciples found in the modern radio years earlier, but his publicdemonstrations were held within lecture halls. He had established that he couldilluminate lamps from a transmitter placed on the roof of his laboratory onHouston Street to his hotel twenty-six blocks away, but these experiments wereheld in secret and were never publicized.23 The 1895 fire also thwarted hisefforts to display long-distance effects.And when Lloyds of London contacted him, to the dismay of his secretary, GeorgeScherff, Tesla rejected the offer to demonstrate his system’s capabilities.Tesla, however, was not content with merely setting up a world broadcastingsystem that, from a conceptual perspective, is superior to our prevailingtechnology in that it would transmit power as well as information; he alsosuggested that he could contact the stars, create rain in the deserts, or causewide-scale havoc. Tesla became the quintessential mad scientist. Through hisinventions, the world could be dominated according to whim.The contradictions within the inventor began to pull him in opposite directions.In letters to the Johnsons he calls himself Tesla Great Inventor and impliesthat, like Paderewski and other luminaries, he was not a mere mortal, but duringhis Niagara Falls speech he denigrated himself. Tesla was somewhat wealthyduring this period, but the requirements of his operations were beyond hismeans. And yet Tesla shunned billing engineers when they sought his aid andvoided a royalty contract with Westinghouse, though it was now worth a fortune.In June 1897 it was reported that Westinghouse had paid $216,000 for hispatents.24 As Tesla and his partners, Brown and Peck, were receiving yearlychecks of $15,000, with an initial down payment of probably $70,000,25 thisworks out to about a quarter of a million dollars for a ten-year period. In aletter to Astor, Tesla places the figure at $500,000,26 but in either case, itwas still millions of dollars less than its actual value.By this time, Westinghouse and GE had formalized their “entente cordiale.” Thismeant that a second gigantic corporation with numerous subsiaries would bebenefiting from Tesla’s invention but the inventor would not receive a dime forit. The electric subway trains would also be implementing the Tesla motors andsystem, and again the inventor would get no compensation.Tesla’s new plans would require enormous expenditures. Westinghouse was makingit clear that his company would not be a source of funds beyond their formersigned agreement (although it is possible that Tesla did receive additionalrevenues for other inventions, such as for his oscillators). At the end of theyear, the inventor wrote his friend Earnest Heinreich, an engineer at theWestinghouse Corporation who also was a novelist. “My dear Heinreich,” Teslawrote, “It is true that I have not been quite well of late, but can assure youthat I am physically and mentally all right at present. I have however, still alittle ailment which may be best designated as financial anemia, from which youare yourself suffering, if I am not mistaken. I wish you would remember me toall the boys at about Xmas time for it is just possible that some of them mightfeel disposed to send me a token.”27There were other pressures as well. Tesla was having difficulties with hisfinancial backer Edward Dean Adams, who was opposing his efforts to promote hiswireless enterprise; there was this continuing competition with Marconi; andthere were the painful echoes of his Serbian past, from Kosovo and his lostyouth. His parents and brother were dead, and he was away from his family notjust in distance but also in spirit. In yet another of so many letters sent,sisters Marica and Angelina pleaded for a response. Tesla had sent funds on manyoccasions and a copy of his Martin text, but they wanted more. “Remember whatyour name is and where you come from,” Marica wrote, ending her letter with thecustomary “I am kissing you in spirit.”28 Part of him ached from the pain, andjust as he was coasting high and ahead of the pack on the crest of the wave.Maybe it was the influence of the Boer War or the unrest brewing in Cuba, butTesla’s destructive streak began to emerge. His previous inventions were alreadyreshaping human events; his newest creation could interlink every remote hamletor tear the world apart. He decided to experiment.With George Scherff present, Tesla placed one of his mechanical oscillators onthe center support beam in the basement of the Houston Street building where hislaboratory was located and adjusted the frequency to the point where the beambegan to hum. “While he was attending to something else for a few moments, itattained such a crescendo of rhythm that it started to shake the building, thenit began shaking the earth nearabout [and other buildings with support beams inresonantfrequencies]…The Fire Department responded to an alarm franticallyturned in; four tons of machinery flew across the basement and the only thingwhich saved the building from utter collapse was the quick action of Dr. Teslain seizing a hammer and destroying his machine.”“The device could be a Frankenstein’s monster,” Tesla confided many years later.“If not watched, no substance can withstand the steadily applied rhythm when itsresonance point is reached. Skyscrapers could easily be destroyed with thesteady building up of resonance from the timed strokes of a five-pound hammer.29In another rendition of the story, told at another time, Tesla claimed that hehad taken his alarm clock-sized oscillator to a building site “in the WallStreet district.” Finding one under construction, about “ten stories high ofsteel framework…” he clamped the vibrator to one of the beams and fussed withthe adjustment until he got it.“In a few minutes I could feel the beam trembling,” Tesla told a reporter.“Gradually, the trembling increased in intensity and extended throughout thewhole great mass of steel. Finally, the structure began to creak and weave, andthe steel-workers came to the ground panic-stricken, believing there had been anearthquake. Rumors spread that the building was about to fall, and the policereserves were called out. Before anything serious happened, I took off thevibrator, put it in my pocket and went away. But if I had kept on ten minutesmore, I could have laid that building flat in the street. And, with the samevibrator, I could drop the Brooklyn Bridge into the East River in less than anhour.”Tesla told the reporter that he could split the earth in the same way, puttingan end to mankind.“The vibrations of the earth,” he said, “have a periodicity of approximately onehour and forty-nine minutes. That is to say, if I strike the earth this instant,a wave of contraction goes through it that will come back in one hour andforty-nine minutes in the form of expansion. As a matter of fact, the earth,like everything else, is in a constant state of vibration. It is constantlycontracting and expanding.“Now suppose that at the precise moment when it begins to contract, I explode aton of dynamite. That accelerates the contraction, and in one hour andforty-nine minutes, there comes an equally accelerated wave of expansion. Whenthe wave of expansion ebbs, suppose I explode another ton…and suppose thisperformance be repeated time after time. Is there any doubt as to what wouldhappen? There is no doubt in my mind. The earth would be split in two. For thefirst time in man’s history, he has the knowledge with which he may interferewith cosmic processes.”Tesla calculated that this procedure might take more than a year to succeed,“but in a few weeks,” Tesla said, “I could set the earth’s crust into such astate of vibration that it would rise and fall hundreds of feet, throwing riversout of their beds, wrecking buildings, and practically destroying civilization.The principle cannot fail.”30"},{"pageContent":"23VRIL POWER (1898) [002-toc.html#ch23]> We entered an immense hall, lighted by…[a] lustre…but diffusing a fragrant> odor.

This device was unveiled at the Electrical Exposition held atMadison Square Garden during the height of the Spanish-American War in May 1898,but earlier precursors could be traced to wireless motors which he displayedbefore the Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1892.This single invention not only established all of the essential principles ofwhat came to be known a few years later as the radio; it also lay as the basisof such other creations as the wireless telephone, garage-door opener, the carradio, the facsimile machine, television, the cable-TV scrambler, andremote-controlled robotics. The precise nature of the invention, virtually itspatent application, was published in most of the technical journals at the timeof its inauguration.2The telautomaton paralleled precisely a model developed by British novelistEdward Bulwer-Lytton in 1871, although Tesla insisted in a missive to Johnson,written two years after the invention’s inauguration, that he had not beeninspired by this science-fiction tale.3As Bulwer-Lytton was perhaps the most popular author next to Charles Dickens atthat time, it is unlikely that Tesla was unaware of this story when he conceivedof the invention. In The Coming Race, Bulwer-Lytton describes a concept which hecalled “vril power.” This was an energy transmitted from the eye and body of thefictional advanced species which was used to animate automatons.4 In essence,Tesla built a working model that substituted electricity for the novelist’s“vril.” The story begins when the protagonist falls into a hole in the earth andcomes upon an advanced civilization: “In all service, whether in or out ofdoors, they [the people of Vril-ya] make great use of automaton figures, whichare so ingenious, and so pliant to the operations of vril, that they actuallyseem gifted with reason. It was scarcely possible to distinguish the figures Ibeheld, apparently guiding…the rapid movements of vast engines, from human formsendowed with thought.”5 As we shall see, key aspects of Bulwer-Lytton’s storycorrelate quite closely with positions espoused by Tesla.The electrical exhibition was organized by Stanford White, who worked with Teslato fashion a rainbow room of neon lights at the entrance, and it was presidedover by Chauncey Depew, another Tesla friend, who was also one of the principalsof the New York Central Railroad and a U.S. senator from New York. It had beenhoped that President McKinley would illuminate the exposition by means oftelegraph lines from Washington, but something went awry, so Vice PresidentGarret Hobart opened the proceedings instead. Representing the Marconi companywas Tom Edison’s son, Tom Junior, who obtained the position through T. C.Martin. This liaison marked the beginning of a partnership between Marconi andEdison, as the Menlo Park wizard had wireless patents which the Italian wantedto own in order to boost his legal position on priority of discovery. The eventalso portended the upcoming break in the friendship between Tesla and Martin.Animosities between Spain and the United States had run high for a number ofyears. Ever since 1895, when the Spaniards took repressive measures againstrebelling Cubans, many Americans began to champion the cause of Cubanannexation.The sinking of the battleship Maine in Havana harbor in February of 1898eliminated any doubts, and war was officially declared two months later. Teslahad been meeting with John Jacob Astor throughout this period in his continuingattempts to woo the financier as Astor spelled out more clearly his position onrelevant issues.6 While his wife played mah-jongg at home, the colonel jauntedalong the deck of his mighty ship, the Nourmahal, which he had armed with fourmachine guns in order to protect against potential pirates. Labeled as insipidand henpecked by gossip columnists, Astor sought his freedom on the high seas.Perhaps it was during an outing on Astor’s yacht that the inventor conceived ofthe idea of fashioning the teleautomaton in the form of a torpedo. “Come to Cubawith me where you can demonstrate your work upon the insufferable scoundrels,”Astor suggested.Tesla may have been tempted, but in the midst of a whirlwind of invention, hegraciously declined as he had been called “for a higher duty.”7Tesla finalized construction of his remote-controlled boat and considered how tomake amends as Astor conferred with President McKinley in Washington and thenhastened to the front lines. The colonel had donated $75,000 to the U.S. Army toequip an artillery division for use in the Philippines and lent the Nourmahal tothe navy for use in battle. The tall ship, nearly a hundred yards in length, wasequipped with a corps of military seamen. Able to feed sixty-five at onesitting, the steam-driven three-masted schooner made a formidable warship. Withhis honorary rank stepped up to inspector general, Colonel Astor sailed hisbattalion down to Cuba, where he could “watch Teddy Roosevelt in the Battle ofSan Juan Hill through a pair of field glasses.”8Beating the Spanish with modern instruments of destruction became the overridingtheme of the exposition. Tesla would have far and away the most sophisticatedconstruction, but he chose to portray it by deceptively emphasizing mysteriousfeatures: “In demonstrating my invention before audiences, the visitors wererequested to ask any question, however involved, and the automaton would answerthem by signs. This was considered magic at the time, but was extremely simple,for it was myself who gave the replies by means of the device.”9The boat, approximately four feet in length and three feet high, was placed in alarge tank in the center of a private auditorium, set up for special viewing forkey investors like J. O. Ashton, George Westinghouse, J. Pierpont Morgan, andCornelius Vanderbilt.10 By means of a variety of transmitters and frequencies,the inventor could start, stop, propel, steer, and operate other features, suchas putting lights on or off. Tesla was also planning on constructing a prototypesubmersible, perhaps to compete in the mock battles that were staged betweenmodels of the American ships and the Spanish fleet, but it was never built.Due to the lack of access the press had to this exclusive invention thenewspapers featured Marconi’s wireless detonation system instead. By means of abomb planted onboard the enemy frigate and a simple button placed in the handsof Tom Junior, “Spanish” ships were blown to smithereens. Marconi, however, hadnot solved the problem of tuning a frequency, and so, on one occasion, Edison’sson accidentally blew up a desk in a back room that had housed other bombs.Fortunately, no one was injured.11It appears that the public appreciated the dramatic Marconi contraption, whichappealed to baser instincts, as compared to Tesla’s masterwork, which wassixteen years ahead of its time operationally and at least a century ahead ofits time conceptually, that is, as envisioned in final form. Only the scientificjournals explained with any clarity the complexity of the device.12Tesla’s coy portrayal kindled a blitzkrieg of epithets from the press. Thefollowing fantastic prognostication particularly upset them:> Torpedo Boat Without a Crew> > My submarine boat, loaded with its torpedoes, can start out from a protected> bay or be dropped over a ship side, make its devious way along the surface,> through dangerous channels of mine beds…watching for its prey, then dart upon> it at a favorite moment…discharge its deadly weapon and return to the hand> that sent it…I am aware that this sounds almost incredible and I have> refrained from making this invention public until I had worked out practically> every detail.13By allowing the following editorial to appear in his journal ElectricalEngineer, T. C. Martin was, in a backhanded way, another to lead the assault.> Mr. Tesla and the Czar> > Mr. Tesla fools himself, if he fools anybody, when he launches into the> dazzling theories and speculations associated with his name…Just of late Mr.> Tesla has been given publicity to some of his newest work…We should be glad> personally to see him finish up some of the many other things that have> occupied his energies these ten years past.The editorial then went on to criticize Tesla’s oscillator and his method of“delivering large quantities of current…without wires, say from Niagara Falls toParis [which has also yet to happen]…Mr. Marconi has already telegraphed fromballoon to balloon without wires…over twenty miles, thus proving in advance thetenability of Mr. Tesla’s proposition.14Discredit of the wireless torpedo followed. This was in reaction to Tesla’ssuggestion that the ultimate weapons could be “devil automata.” Caught up in warfever, Tesla emphasized nefarious implications of his work: Automatons wouldfight while humans would live. He wrote, “The continuous development in thisdirection must ultimately make war a mere context of machines without men andwithout loss of life—a condition [which will lead]…in my opinion…to permanentpeace.”15This position was refuted by a number of individuals, the most eloquent byFrenchman M. Huart:> The Genius of Destruction> > Like all inventors of destructive machines, [Tesla] claims that his [devil> automata] will make the governments which are inclined to create international> conflagrations hesitate. On this account Nikola Tesla claims a right to be> called a benefactor of humanity. The genius of destruction would seem to have,> then, two aims. It creates evil but mostly good. Through its help the> abolition of wars may no longer be a utopia of generous dreamers. A blessed> era will open up to the people, whose quarrels will be settled in view of the> terror of the cataclysms promised by science. What contradictions of> conception is the human mind subject to?16Coincidentally, this view was espoused by Mark Twain, who wrote to Tesla fromEurope wanting to sell the patents to cabinet ministers in Austria, Germany, andEngland, by Bulwer-Lytton, and by Czar Nicholas of Russia, whom Tesla himselfwas negotiating with.17 (And that was how “Nicholas” Tesla became associatedwith the czar.) In the modern era, Edward Teller, one of the inventors of thehydrogen bomb, and, more recently, President Ronald Reagan in his 1980s StarWars speeches, have also expounded on this position. But Tesla (much likeEinstein) came to regret his initial view of how the agents of Armageddon couldlead humans to peace.The brazen essay, which had appeared in Martin’s journal, continued as anintroduction to Tesla’s “thoughtful” paper on electrotherapeutics and thenconcluded with the following convoluted backhand compliment:> It is not our desire to pose as apologists or publicists for Mr. Tesla. He> needs no assistance of that kind; and so long as he commands freely whole> pages of the Sunday papers, for which Mr. Wanamaker pays gladly his thousands> of dollars, the scientific journals have little to do with the matter.

No man has finished his work till he is dead, and> even then there are long, long centuries in which his ideas can prove> themselves true. The visionaries are thus often in the end the most sordid of> realists—something Mr. Tesla will never be.18As Martin had been, in a sense, Tesla’s advance man, his decision to allow thiscritique in his journal became a tacit sanction for other writers to unfurltheir condemnation. For instance, another scathing review appeared in both TheScientific American and the more popular Public Opinion. The article appeared onthe same page as the obituary of mountebank inventor John Worrell Keely.> Was Keely a Charlatan?> > In the death of J. W. Keely of Keely Motor fame…the world has been robbed of> one of its most unique and fascinating characters…[Keely] was always going to> startle the world but never did. It is sincerely to be hoped that Keely’s> alleged secrets have died with him.> > Science and Sensationalism> > …That the author of the multiphase system of transmission should, at this late> date, be flooding the press with rhetorical bombast that recalls the wildest> days of the Keely Motor mania is inconsistent and inexplicable to the last> degree…The facts of Mr. Tesla’s invention are few and simple as the fancies> which have been woven around it are many and extravagant. The principles of> the invention are not new, nor was Tesla the original discoverer.19This implication that Tesla was not the author of his system of wirelesscommunication echoed previous charges that he was not the genuine inventor ofthe AC polyphase system. This was what particularly angered him, as it wasessential that his work be original. “I wish I could lay upon the fellow all theforked lightning in my laboratory,” Tesla told the Johnsons at dinner at theirhome.20“Perhaps it would be more effective if an outside person came to your defense,”Robert suggested.“My dear Luka, I know that you are a noble fellow and devoted friend and Iappreciate your indignation at these uncalled for attacks, but I beg you not toget involved under any condition as you would offend me. Let my ‘friends’ dotheir worst, I like it better so. Let them spring on scientific societiesworthless schemes, oppose a cause which is deserving, throw sand into the eyesof those who might see. They will reap their reward in time.”21“Then how can we redress such an outrageous individual?”“Let us have a profound contempt for the creature,” Tesla concluded.“I don’t see Commerford in this same category,” Katharine offered, trying to setthe stage for a reconciliation.“I know you and Luka want me to forgive your friend Martin for his disparagingeditorial. It was well done, but not so painstakingly as many others before. Herenders me more and more valuable services.”“At least talk to him,” Katharine pleaded.Tesla grabbed his hat, coat, and gloves and waved his hand. “Sorry for him. Thatis all,” he said as he departed.22Tesla counterattacked with a spirited response to Electrical Engineer which theywere forced to publish:> On more than one occasion you have offended me, but in my qualities both as> Christian and philosopher I have always forgiven you and only pitied you for> your errors. This time, though, your offense is graver than the previous ones,> for you have dared to cast a shadow on my honor…Being a bearer of high honors> from a number of American universities, it is my duty, in view of this slur,> to exact from you a complete and humble apology…On this condition I will again> forgive you, but I would advise you to limit yourself in your future attacks> to statements for which you are not liable to be punished by law.23Tesla, of course, was angry with the general tone of their editorial; but whatparticularly upset him was the implication that he had abandoned his mechanicaland electrical oscillators and his cold lamps without filaments (fluorescentlights). He was in the midst of negotiating a large business transaction with anumber of investors, particularly Astor. In no way did he want there to be anyimplication that these endeavors were being abandoned.Martin’s rebuttal was published right after Tesla’s letter:> His Friends to Mr. Tesla> > One foremost electrical inventor [unnamed—probably Elihu Thomson]…has been> kind enough to say that the Electrical Engineer made Mr. Tesla.This statement was disputed by Martin as “a person’s actions make the person”;however, the journal (i.e., Martin) did cite the fact that in the past itpublished Tesla’s articles and book of his inventions and lectures and,furthermore, that it was their editor who has “striven with all the abilitypossessed to explain Mr. Tesla’s ideas.” This is completely true. For aneight-year period, 1890-98, Electrical Engineer published 167 articles by orabout Tesla, 40 more than Electrical Review and 70 more than Electrical World.24Moreover, it was clearly Martin who choreographed the reclusive inventor’sentrée into the American electrical arena.As Tesla often promised more than he delivered, the journal, as a “true friend,”felt an obligation to urge him to complete “a long trial of beautiful butunfinished inventions.” They (i.e., Martin) also took keen exception to thefantastic statements about Tesla’s remote-controlled flying machine that couldchange its direction in flight, “explode at will and…never make a miss.” Martincontinued: “Our past admiration of Mr. Tesla’s real, tangible work is on record,and stands; but we draw the line at such things as these. We are sorry Mr. Teslafeels so keenly, but we cannot help it.”25Given that this assault stemmed from one of Tesla’s closest allies, it bearscareful consideration. However, from a historical perspective, we should alsoconsider hidden agendas. For instance, in 1894, Tesla was freely distributinghis collected works and not paying for additional copies.“I made some money out of my Tesla book,” Martin confessed to Elihu Thomson manyyears later, “[but it was] promptly borrowed from me by the titular component,so that two years of work went for nothing.”26 The following year, in 1895,Tesla’s laboratory burned to the ground, and Martin wrote an admirabletribute.27 Perhaps that is why he did not insist Tesla repay him.Martin had been placed in an awkward position, for he was also a good friend ofTom Edison’s, a powerful Tesla rival; and as a reporter he had to be objectivein covering advances from other rivals, such as Marconi. Tesla’s irritatinghabit of living beyond his means and seeing projects completed before theyactually materialized was forever a source of frustration to his longtimeprotector. And history has so proved, in many ways, that Martin was right.Tesla’s oscillators were never a commercial success; his wireless system ofdistributing light, information, and power (in its total form) was neverrealized; and for reasons difficult to understand, Tesla’s fluorescent lightswere never marketed.On the other hand, Tesla was extremely prolific. He did build working models ofall of his inventions. For instance, the telautomaton was a fully functioningprototype. And it takes many years for one’s endeavors to come to fruition.Tesla had already proved himself in a variety of ways. That all of his projectsnever materialized is understandable given the great scope of his efforts.Tesla’s telautomaton remains one of the single most important technologicaltriumphs of the modern age. In its final form, it was conceived as a newmechanical species capable of thinking as humans do, capable of carrying outcomplex assignments and even capable of reproduction. The invention alsocomprised all of the essential features of wireless transmission and selectivetuning. Here was a true work of genius.Surprisingly, Tesla was an adherent of a stimulus-response model for explaininghuman behavior and consciousness rather than a proponent of a model espousing acreative unconscious. The rivalry between Ernst Mach and Carl Stumpf, Tesla’sphilosophy teacher, discussed earlier, and the work of Descartes on theself-propelled automata correlate to a number of key positions Tesla took whichinfluenced directly the development of his telautomaton. The mind, according tothis proposition, was nothing more than a simple compilation of cause-and-effectsensations. What we call ideas were secondary impressions derived from theseprimary sensations.Paradoxically, although Tesla’s achievement was highly original and although hetouted himself as the “creator of new principles,” in no way did the inventorthink that he had ever produced a new idea that did not stem from somethingexternal, for example, a mechanism present in nature or deriving from the workof others. A reader of great philosophers, Tesla fully understood what theadoption of his telautomaton would mean to the world. He saw clearly theimplication in the “coming race.” Machines would not only replace laborers, theywould think for themselves. Tesla’s genius, therefore, was not only in theappreciation of the advanced thinking of others but also and more important, inimplementing on a practical basis their abstract ideas. Whereas others sought tochange the world with thoughts, Tesla manifested on the physical plane realworking models. He certainly was the father of remote-controlled electronic“beings,” but he would have been the last person to claim that he was the fatherof the idea.In a famous article printed in the Century in 1900, Tesla explained the entireconceptualization behind his telautomaton: “I have, by every thought and everyact of mine, demonstrated and do so daily, to my absolute satisfaction that I aman automaton endowed with a power of movement, which merely responds to externalstimuli beating upon my sense organs, and thinks and acts accordingly. Iremember only one or two cases in all my life which I was unable to locate thefirst impression which prompted a movement, or a thought, or even a dream.”28Tesla neglects to mention that one of these two instances was the revelation hehad in Professor Poeschl’s class: He had seen that the commutator could beeliminated in the DC machines. In other words, Tesla’s most successfulinvention, the AC polyphase system, was initiated from intuitive insight.Nevertheless, Tesla stubbornly clung to the “tabula rasa” premise. Noinspiration, according to this pundit, began from within; self-directedresponses were initiated only after external stimuli were received. This is acomplex idea, as it seems from the first paragraph below that Tesla believes thereverse.> How Cosmic Forces Shape Our Destinies> > Every living being is an engine geared to the wheelwork of the universe…There> is no constellation or nebula, no sun or planet…that does not exercise some> control over its destiny—not in the vague and delusive sense of astrology, but> in the rigid and positive meaning of physical science.> > More than this can be said. There is no thing endowed with life—from man who> is enslaving the elements, to the humblest creature—in all the world that does> not sway in its turn.29At the time he conceived these ideas, that is, in the early 1890s, Tesla wasstudying Herbert Spencer and also Buddhist writings. He even gave his friendJohnson a copy of a book on Buddhism to read. Nevertheless, the influence ofMach’s principle and Newton’s laws concerning such correlates as the angularmomentum of the earth, sun, and galaxy also figured into his cosmologicalparadigm. “The Buddhist expresses it one way, the Christian in another, but bothsay the same: We are all one…Science, too, recognizes this connectedness ofseparate individuals, though not quite in the same sense that it admits that thesuns, planets and moons of a constellation are one body, and there can be nodoubt that it will be experimentally confirmed in times to come.30Having studied will psychology (occult psychological principles) as a youth,Tesla was a firm believer in self-determination and the incredible power of thewill. Somehow, however, he reconciled this internal procedure, which thephilosopher George Gurdjieff links to a direct expression of the soul, to hisexternal-behavioristic paradigm. For Tesla, the spark of life is not onlybiological but also present in the structure of matter: “Even matter calledinorganic, believed to be dead, responds to irritants and gives unmistakableevidence of a living principle within.”31Such things as metals respond to stimuli (e.g., magnets). Tesla refuses toseparate the motive forces involved in electromagnetic effects from reactions of“living” matter. This in essence was Bulwer-Lytton’s “vril power.” The energythat runs the universe directs life. “Thus, everything that exists, organic orinorganic, animated or inert, is susceptible to stimulus from the outside. Thereis no gap between, no break in continuity, no special and distinguishing vitalagent. The momentous question of Spencer, What is it that causes inorganicmatter to run into organic forms? has been answered. It is the sun’s heat andlight. Wherever they are there is life.”32As Tesla himself was a “self-propelled automaton entirely under the control ofexternal influences,” he could use the model of himself to build histelautomaton. What we call memory, Tesla further stated, “is but increasedresponsiveness to repeated stimuli.” Creative thinking and also dreaming wouldbe derived from secondary reverberations of these initial external stimuli.> Long ago I conceived the idea of constructing an automaton which would> mechanically represent me, and which would respond, as I do myself, but of> course, in a much more primitive manner to external influences. Such an> automaton evidently had to have motive power, organs for locomotion, directive> organs and one or more sensitive organs so adapted as to be excited by> external stimuli…> > Whether the automaton be of flesh and bone, or of wood and steel, it mattered> little, provided it could provide all the duties required of it like an> intelligent being.33To Tesla, his remote-controlled boat was not simply a machine, it was a newtechnological creation endowed with the ability to think. In Tesla’s view, itwas also, in a sense, the first nonbiological life-form on the planet. As aprototype, this first new life-form was “embodied,” in Tesla words, with a“borrowed mind,” his own! “[It will be able] to follow a course laid out or…obeycommands given far in advance, it will be capable of distinguishing between whatit ought and what it ought not to do…and of recording impressions which willdefinitely affect its subsequent actions.”34Very few individuals could comprehend the magnitude of the creation in 1898, andso they lashed out at Tesla instead.In November 1898, the examiner in chief of patents came to witness ademonstration of Tesla’s telautomaton before granting a patent, so“unbelievable” was the claim. “I remember that when later I called on anofficial in Washington, with a view of offering the invention to theGovernment,” Tesla wrote, “he burst out in laughter…Nobody thought then thatthere was the faintest prospect of perfecting such a device.”35"},{"pageContent":"24WALDORF-ASTORIA (1898) [002-toc.html#ch24]> November 29, 1897> > My dear Luka,> > I have concluded that so important a literary event as the appearance of your> splendid book of poems should be firstly commemorated by a dinner at the> Waldorf as Mrs. Filipov suggested in her peculiarly delicate way…As this does> not seem possible because of your immense popularity, I would like you to name> another evening very soon, however, for my money may run out.> > Yours sincerely,> N. Tesla1The Waldorf-Astoria was the tallest hotel in the world, a center for banquets,concerts, and conventions in the city, and the permanent or temporary residenceof the wealthiest and most eminent citizens of the day. Residing there became agoal to which Tesla aspired; it would be one he would achieve before the end ofthe year, and one he would maintain for the next two decades. Built in twoparts, the original Waldorf was completed by William Waldorf Astor in 1893; theAstoria, by his cousin, John Jacob Astor, in late 1897. At first, Jack wasreluctant to tear down his mother’s home to erect a hotel, but after the Waldorfgrossed $4.5 million in its first year, he changed his mind. Its opening “markedthe beginning of a new concept in living,” extolling the essence ofexclusiveness, cordiality, pomposity, and elegant grandiosity to the masses.2The manager, George C. Boldt, was a Prussian immigrant from the island of Rügen,situated near Denmark in the Baltic Sea. “Mild mannered, dignified andunassuming,” Boldt resembled “a typical German professor with his close-croppedbeard which he kept fastidiously trimmed…and his pince-nez glasses on a blacksilk cord.” Described also as “a martinet, and a man of mercurial moods,” Boldtwas a socialite, in certain ways, of the most superficial kind. “I would rathersee Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish enjoying a cup of tea in an all but empty Palm room,”Boldt declared, “than a dozen lesserknown guests there feasting.”3The manager also adored mechanical contrivances, sprinkling the hotel with suchmodern conveniences as pneumatic tubes, electric bulb carriage calls, flashingcontrol panels on the elevators, and “his network of hushed but authoritativebuzzers.”4 A few years later, the Waldorf would be the first hotel with a radiotower. No doubt, Tesla, himself an elitist, was attractive to Boldt. With hisposition of inventor extraordinaire well established, it is likely that theinventor was accepted in a distinct class above the manager. Once he moved in,Tesla may even have avoided paying rent in lieu of his connection with Astor, orhe may have negotiated a favorable deal.With over nine hundred on staff, the acclaimed “Oscar of the Waldorf” as chef,and Boldt’s capable wife overseeing the decor, there was no finer establishment.A regal fragrance wafted from every corner of the hotel, with exquisiteporcelain, exotic flowers, and expensive furniture decorating the halls, diningrooms, and suites. This was the alley where the peacocks came to strut. At oversix feet two inches and dressed in suede high-tops, tails, cane, top hat, andever-present white gloves, Nikola Tesla was one of the proudest and mostrenowned.The Spanish-American War dragged on through most of 1898 as Tesla continued totry to exploit his telautomaton for use as a naval weapon. He had offered hiswireless transmitters to aid in the organizing of ship and troop movements butwas turned down by the secretary of the navy for fear, as Tesla reported a yearlater, “that I might cause a calamity, as sparks are apt to fly anywhere in theneighborhood of such apparatus when it is at work.” Tesla tried to guaranteethat he had overcome “these defects and limitations,” but it was to no avail.5Public demonstrations and photographs of lightning bolts spewing from hisingenuity worked to hinder any assurances he might give. Instead, during theconflict, the navy utilized hot-air balloons connected to ships by telegraphlines instead. Being up in one would “make a man’s hair turn white,” since theballoon was an easy target, but soldiers had to “obey orders, and that was allthere was to it.”6Tesla contacted shipbuilder Mr. Nixon, designer of the Oregon (the Villard oceanliner he had fixed while working for Tom Edison in 1884), and also submarinebuilder John P. Holland.7 Two years later, Holland would sell the navy its firstsubmersible; it would weigh a commanding seventy-four tons and become aquintessential fighting machine,8 but in 1898 he was still having difficultynegotiating a deal. “The Navy Department was obliged to decline…[Holland’soffer] to go into Santiago Harbor and destroy the Spanish warships…as it smackedof privateering and was in violation of international law.”9 And Tesla alsoinvited military personnel to his laboratory, particularly U.S. Navy RearAdmiral Francis J. Higginson, chairman of the Light House Board, to discuss theuse of his wireless transmitters. But dealing with the government was anythingbut easy.10During this period, in June 1898, Richmond Pearson Hobson rocketed to stardom,capturing the hearts of America through his heroic efforts in the war. A fewmonths later, Hobson would become the key attraction of the Tesla-Johnson socialnet, and a decade after that, his fame so well established, he would become apresidential candidate.11On June 4, the New York Times reported that a bold American fighting frigate,the Merrimac, had “made a dash” into Santiago Harbor under “a lively cannonadeof fire” in attempts to attack the waiting Spanish armada. The ship was sunk,and “an officer, an engineer and six seamen were taken prisoners.” The Timesconcluded, “Everybody is astounded at the audacity of the American vessel.”12The following day, it was revealed that enemy fire had not sunk the ship at all.Rather, it had been deliberately scuttled by Lieutenant Hobson for the purposeof locking in the harbor the entire Spanish fleet. “This splendid stroke”effectively removed the feared Admiral Cervera from the war. “In a day, in anhour, the potent, all-pervading force of electricity…flashed his fame over theround world.”13 As Hobson was imprisoned in the dungeon of Morro Castle, hecontinued to make headlines as the world waited for the war to end and hishoped-for release.14As ever, Katharine continued to spread her Irish charms, inviting the Serbianmystic to dinner so that she could be “hypnotized” by his presence.15 The veryday of the sinking of the Merrimac, the inventor received the followingprovocative missive:> June 6, 1898> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > I want very much to see you [tomorrow evening], and will be really> disappointed if you do not think my request worthy of your consideration.> Robert is giving himself a birthday party and he is going to have some of your> Servian songs sung.> > You must save this evening for us.

But it is not satisfactory for it does not give the proper idea> of your hand which is large and free. Like yourself, this seems sticky, short,> I know what causes this, it is the shadows. You must try again and make your> hand be as large and grand as it is.> > Faithfully yours,> Katharine Johnson16In January, Tesla had published a full-page photograph of his hand forElectrical Review in his attempts to dramatically display the improvements hehad made in the efficiency of his vacuum lamps.17 Every line on the palm wasvisible, so effective was the illuminant (although, as Katharine points out, theshape is marred by an underlying shadow). The famous palmist Cheiro was the rageof the day, having published analyses of the hands of such celebrities as TomEdison, Sarah Bernhardt, and Theosophist Annie Besant. Mark Twain commented:“Cheiro has exposed my character to me with humiliating accuracy. I ought not toconfess this accuracy, still I am moved to do it.”18It seems likely that Tesla’s clever vanity had come upon a way to exploit hisfluorescent tubes and at the same time reveal in a veiled way the magnanimity ofhis being by exposing his hand to the world. Referring to a professionalpalmist, Tesla’s hand supposedly reveals “a flirtatious streak andhypersensitivity” seen in the Girdle of Venus; from the head line “incessantworries stemming from the past,” a close association with his mother (because itis tied to the heart line), “an irrational streak and blind spot in histhinking” (due to chaining, an undulating course, and foreshortening of theline); and all of this is counterbalanced by a “remarkable fate line, which,rising like a firm oak tree, reveals stability, vision, creative aspiration,stubbornness and an ability to withstand great stress and turmoil…The fate lineis the strongest line in the hand.”19During these months playful banter peaked between the inventor and the elusiveMadame Filipov; it seems she tried to get Tesla married. In February, Katharinewrote, “Another charming lady is to be here who does not believe that you are myfriend, that I even know you. I wish to convince her that you are on my list andyou shall sit beside her. Come and shed the radiance of your happy countenanceupon us all especially the Johnsons.”20In March she demands that Tesla join them for luncb to “bring solace to yourfriends” and a few days later invites him over again. “A very charming girl isto be here who wants very much to meet Mr. Tesla. A real one, I assure you.”21Tesla decides to have everyone for dinner first and writes, “I shall send myprivate equipage…to dine…at the Waldorf and I am getting up the appetite for theoccasion.”22Tesla’s celibacy has always been a question mark. It seems probable that he andKatharine had engaged in a “sticky” liaison a few years earlier, but at thisstage, due in part to Katharine’s arrangements, Tesla had become active withother women, and Katharine had enjoyed his pleasures vicariously. Three ladieswho interested him were Mrs. Winslow, Miss Amatia Kussner, and Miss MargueriteMerrington. The first, alas, was married; to the second, Tesla wanted to displayhis inventions at his laboratory; “There is another reason why she should comebut that is difficult to say…Well I do not want to say anything disparaging of alady.”23For yet another “Johnson blowout” Tesla wrote, concerning the third lady, “I’dsooner be glad to rely on your choice and only remember to suggest MissMerrington—if she would come. I know I would be her victim—before dinner, butafter that I think I could hold my own for she does not drink claret.”24 And afew months later:> March 9, 1899> > My dear Mrs. Johnson,> > I shall be glad to have any of your friends come but we must have one lady for> each gentleman—else you must dine without me…Agnes must come by all means> and—wouldn’t you invite Miss Merrington?

This success was followed two years later when she won a $500prize from the National Conservatory of Music for her libretto Daphne, which wasreviewed by, among others, Antonin Dvořák. “Tall, graceful and charming,” theregal Miss Merrington was a “frequent dinner guest at the Johnson home.” Anintegral part of the Gramercy Park set, Miss Merrington accompanied the youngOwen Johnson to Mark Twain’s birthday party in 1905 and maintained her creativespark throughout her life, writing a book on General Custer and his wife in1950, the year before she died, unmarried, at the age of ninety-one.26In August 1898, John Jacob Astor returned from the battlegrounds, but it was notuntil December that Tesla met with Astor at his home. While Jack was consideredby many to be “cold-hearted, humorless, weak-minded and almost completely absentof personality,”27 his wife, Ava, was seen as the most beautiful woman inAmerica. Tesla was particularly taken by Lady Astor’s loveliness, and it seemsthat she was enthralled by the inventor’s experiments. The three dined togetheron occasion at Delmonico’s or the Waldorf, and when Tesla arrived at the Astorresidence, he often brought along a bouquet of flowers. But although“Ava…sparkle[d] at every lighted candle and Jack…followed her about like abedraggled and slightly bad tempered spaniel,” all was not well with themarriage; where Astor was able to leave his exquisite wife for months on end,touring the high seas for adventure and the noble cause, she retreated byentertaining a zealous interest in bridge.28image 4 [images/image-04.jpg]Thus, even though Ava was on his side, the inventor was uncertain of hisstanding. “My dear Astor,” Tesla began, “I would like to explain why I could notgo down to Cuba with you.”“I understand,” Astor replied. “During the gunfire, perhaps that is when itdawned on me, I realized that your life was too precious to risk on such a trip.I see, however, from recent reports that you have been attacked after all, butit has been by reporters instead.”“I’m glad,” Tesla quipped, “that I am living in a place in which, though theycan roast me in the papers, they cannot burn me at the stake.”29Tesla thereupon called a meeting with Astor and two of his cronies, Mr. ClarenceMcKay and Mr. Darius Ogden Mills, so that he could display his continuingprogress with his oscillators and fluorescent lights as well as show them patentapplications, articles which had appeared in the technical journals, and reportson tests performed by the Royal Society in London and the Roentgen Society inGermany. “Let me read you the following dispatch from Sir William Crookes,”Tesla said. “Congratulations. The performance of your machine is marvelous.” AndTesla presented another report, which hailed his oscillator as “one of the mostsignificant of the age.”“You will see how many enterprises can be built up on that novel principle,Colonel. It is for a reason that I am often and violently attacked, because myinventions threaten a number of established industries. My telautomaton, forinstance, opens up a new art which will sooner or later render large gunsentirely useless, and will make impossible the building of large battleships,and will, as I have stated in my patent long before the Czar’s manifesto, compelthe nations to come to an understanding for the maintenance of peace.”30“You are taking too many leaps for me,” Astor said, causing the others toreconsider as well. “Let us stick to oscillators and cold lights. Let me seesome success in the marketplace with these two enterprises, before you go offsaving the world with an invention of an entirely different order, and then Iwill commit more than my good wishes. Stop in again when you have a soundproposal or call me on the telephone.”Tesla waited until the new year and then hit the colonel with a direct assault.“My dear Astor,” Tesla said, “It has always been my firm belief that you take agenuine, friendly interest in myself personally as well as in my labors…Now Iask you frankly, when I have a friend like J.J.A., a prince among wealthy men, apatriot ready to risk his life for his country, a man who means every word hesays—who puts such a value on my labors and who offers repeatedly to back meup—have I not a foundation for believing that he would stand by me when, afterseveral years of hard work I have finally brought to commercial perfection someimportant inventions which, even at the most conservative estimate, must bevalued at several million dollars.”Informing Astor that George Westinghouse had given him $500,000 for the ACpolyphase system and that Edward Dean Adams had invested $100,000 to become apartner in his later endeavors when he had “14 [new] U.S. and as many foreignpatents,” Tesla remarked that there was a “powerful clique” which still nowopposed him. “And it is chiefly for this reason that I want a few friends, likeyourself, to give me at this moment their valuable financial and moral support.”Having “placed faith” in Astor’s words, Tesla reveals that he had sold offsecurities to buy back control of his company, although “Mr. Adams still has aminority interest.” Having stated that his laboratory in the past has “paid$1500 for every $100 invested, on the average,” the inventor proclaims, “I amfully confident that the property which I have now in my hands will pay muchbetter than this.”“I now produce a light superior by far to that of the incandescent lamp with onethird of the expenditure of energy, and as my lamps will last forever, the costof maintenance will be minute. The cost of copper, which in the old system, is amost important item, is in mine reduced to a mere trifle, for I can run on awire sufficient for one incandescent lamp more than 1000 of my own lamps, givingfully 5000 times as much light. Let me ask you, Colonel, how much is this aloneworth when you consider that there are hundreds of millions of dollars investedto-day in electric light in the various chief countries in which I have patentedmy inventions in this field?“Sooner or later,” Tesla continues, “my system will be purchased either by theWhitney Syndicate, G.E. or Westinghouse, for otherwise they will be driven outof the market.”The inventor closed: “Then consider my oscillators and my system of transmittingpower without wires, my method of directing the movement of bodies at a distanceby wireless telegraphy, the manufactures of fertilizers and nitric acid from theair, the production of ozone…and many other important lines of manufacture as,for instance, cheap refrigeration and cheap manufacture of liquid air, etc.—andyou will see that, putting a fair estimate on all, I cannot offer to sell anyconsiderable amount of my property for less than $1000 a share. I am perfectlysure that I will be able to command that price as soon as some of my inventionsare on the market.”Telling Astor that he had contracts pending with “the Creusot Works in France,the Helios Company in Germany, Ganz and Company in Austria and other firms,”Tesla requested an investment of $100,000. “If you do not take that muchinterest you will put me at a great disadvantage.” Should Astor come in, otherAstor associates, such as Mr. McKay and Darius Ogden Mills, “would do the same.”If, Tesla wrote, “after six months you should have any reason to bedissatisfied, it will be my first duty to satisfy you.”31Astor stressed interest in seeing Tesla exploit his fluorescent lights, and theinventor agreed. On January 10, 1899, papers were signed whereby Astor gaveTesla $100,000 for five hundred shares of the Tesla Electric Company; in return,Astor was elected director of the board.32 At the same time, Tesla moved intothe Waldorf-Astoria. Tesla also received $10,000 from the dry-goods manufacturerSimpson and Crawford,33 and he may also have received funds from Mr. Mills orMr. McKay. The old Tesla Company, with William Rankine and Edward D. Adams, was,for all intents and purposes, dissolved, along with his relationship with AlfredBrown and Charles Peck, although all of these individuals may have in one way oranother been involved in the new enterprise.The first letter on Waldorf stationery written to the Johnsons is dated November3, 1898. It is one of the rare letters in which Tesla refers to Mrs. Johnson as“My dear Kate.” Tesla was about to hook a big fish, perhaps the wealthiest fishon the planet, and his sense of self-importance escalated accordingly. Inhaughty fanfare, the Serbian aristocrat separated his exalted ilk from “othersocial tribolites…plebians, drummers, grocerymen, [and] Jews.”34 Anti-Semiticreferences are rare in the Tesla correspondence, but no doubt he wasanti-Semitic, at least in the social sense, that is, as a common reflection ofthe times. Anti-Semitism against ethnic ghetto dwellers, such as those newlyarrived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and New York’s Lower East Side, was commonamong the upper classes, even though the Rothschilds, August Belmont, JacobSchiff, and Bernard Baruch were well respected and known to be Jewish. It is,however, clear evidence of one of Tesla’s prejudices. The letter also refers toTesla’s wish to meet Lieutenant Hobson, whose Cuban exploits had been featuredin the Century. “The interest in [Hobson] was at a fever heat [at our offices],”Johnson recalled, “[and] the estimates of the sale of his [proposed] book raninto the hundred thousands.” Unfortunately, shortly after his account appeared,a scandalous event occurred which was egged on by the “sensational press,” andthe idea for the book “fell flat.”35 The incident had to do with Hobson’shandsome appearance and the inability of women to refrain from kissing him whenhe came into their midst.“I would have cut off my right arm rather than to offend one of [those ladies],”Hobson declared, concluding, “The kissing episodes, what little there was tothem, were entirely beyond my control, and my conscience is clear.”36The dashing lieutenant was well liked by Tesla and the Johnsons, and his entréeinto their circle added a wonderful spark to their lives. He would join a groupthat included at this time the Gilders, Miss Kussner, Miss Merrington, Mrs.Winslow, Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Dodge, Rudyard Kipling, and John Muir. Playfuljealousies became evident as Tesla and the Johnsons vied for the war hero’sattention, Tesla daring even to tender to Hobson one lady with whom the inventormay have had intimate relations.“Remember, Luka,” Tesla teased, “Hobson does not belong to the Johnsonsexclusively. I shall avenge myself on Mme. Filipov by introducing him to Mme.Kussner and somebody will be forgotten.”37Tesla spent many “delightful” hours with Hobson, inviting him to the laboratory,to dinner, and out on the town. “He is a fine fellow,” the inventor concluded.38Their friendship would last.Hobson, twenty-eight, a southerner, was a striking presence in his uniform, withdeep-set, penetrating eyes, hair swept back, a firm, prominent chin, and ahandlebar mustache. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy in 1889, he had spentthree years in Paris studying at a maritime college and had worked for theOffice of Naval Intelligence.Gifted with a keen mind, Hobson had worked for the secretary of the navy duringthe China-Japan war. His family, on both sides, included lawyers, judges, agovernor, and a general.39 He was a ready-made hero, and he was a social catchof the first order.All the pieces of Tesla’s puzzle were now in place. He had obtained fundamentalpatents on wireless communication and remote control, he had calculated the typeof energy he needed in order to disturb the electical conditions of the planet,he had obtained a sizable sum of working capital from one of the wealthiest menin the world, he had begun serious negotiations with the U.S. Navy, and, as asocial triumph, he had moved into the Waldorf-Astoria. The budding entrepreneursettled upon a plan for marketing his oscillators and cold lamps—well, theycould wait for now—and then Tesla took the next bold step. He would test hiswireless theories on a grand scale.The laboratory at Houston Street was simply too small and vulnerable to firesand potential spies. With few people aware, Tesla had scouted the country toseek out potential sites for his new “Experimental Station.” George Scherff, hiscapable secretary, tried to get Tesla to reconsider, to stay in New York and dosomething tangible, something that would pay an immediate return, but he wastalking to a deaf ear. Destiny was urging Tesla westward."},{"pageContent":"25COLORADO SPRINGS (1899) [002-toc.html#ch25]> Nikola Tesla, the Servian scientist, whose electrical discoveries are not of> one nation, but the pride of the world, has taken up his abode in Colorado> Springs…On East Pike’s Peak avenue, with limitless plains stretching to the> eastward, and a panorama of mighty mountains sweeping away north and south, to> the west—Tesla has caused to be constructed a [wireless] station for> scientific research.> > DESIRE STANTON, COLORADO SPRINGS, 18991Having been invited to Colorado Springs to build his laboratory by Westinghousepatent attorney Leonard E. Curtis, a longtime adviser and friend through thedifficult years of the “battle of the currents,” Tesla shipped his equipment inearly spring, 1899. Before he left New York and as the coup de grâce to hisrelationship with T. C. Martin, Tesla met with competing editor Charles W. Priceof Electrical Review and professional photographer Dickenson Alley tochoreograph a spectacular piece on the wizard’s laboratory. Complete with a richdescription of his experiments and a sensational series of photographs, thearticle ran in the March 29, 1899, issue. Starting with a full-length portraitof the inventor grasping a basketball-sized wireless vacuum lamp glowingresplendently, the essay went on to describe the evolution of other inventions,such as his high-tension transformer, which resulted in Tesla’s flat, spiraltransmitting coil. This eight-foot transmitter, “easily recognizable by itsspider web appearance” was the first which efficiently enabled the inventor togenerate two individualized vibrations, or tuned circuits, simultaneously andalso produce many millions of volts.2 Other prints depicted the flamboyantengineer transmitting high currents through his body to illuminate a variety ofvacuum tubes, such as one which he whipped around his head in a multipleexposure. With one hand seeming to pluck a refulgent rod out of the midst of aspiral galaxy of blurred light and the other grasping a sparking, circularhigh-tension coil, “the operator’s body…[was] charged to a [great] potential.”3Tesla arrived in Colorado Springs on May 18, 1899, after stopping in Chicago todisplay his telautomaton to the Commercial Club, a local electrical society.Situated at the very gateway to the Rocky Mountains, at the edge of a plain thatstretched for hundreds of miles, the Colorado site would prove an excellentchoice not only for monitoring wireless energy generated from his transmitterbut also for studying a common phenomenon in the region, the electrical storms.Stepping from the station after his weeklong journey, the inventor was met byCurtis and a few dignitaries. A horse and carriage took him to his hotel, theAlta Vista, where he stayed, in room 207.4 Much like his childhood home inSmiljan, the town was situated at the foothills of a mighty chain of mountains.The Rockies arose so suddenly that they looked almost as if they were stillbeing formed. A view on a clear day stretched virtually to Wyoming to the northand New Mexico to the south, and it was a common sight to witness lightningstorms in the distance while standing in sunshine.Hoping to be the “Little London” of the West, the people of “the Springs”welcomed the great inventor by honoring him with a banquet, sponsored by Curtis,at the El Paso Club. Well known throughout the region because his AC powertransmission system had been adopted at lead, silver, and gold mines in suchcamps as Telluride and Cripple Creek, Tesla was happily met by society people,town officials, and the governor.5 A few days later, another notable also cameto town, Admiral Schley, recently back from his victory in Santiago Bay. Theentire town celebrated the hero’s visit.6 No doubt Tesla had easy access to theadmiral, and they probably discussed the potential use of his telautomaton as aweapon to help abolish war.As part of Tesla’s arrangement, with Curtis’s guarantee, the El Paso ElectricCompany provided Tesla with free electrical power to support the great quest.Local contractor Joseph Dozier was introduced to discuss construction of thelab. Off they drove down Pike’s Peak Avenue to what is now the corner of CoyoteStreet, near Prospect Lake, to look the site over. Dozier, it appears, had amystical bent, so discussions drifted to talk of life on other planets andunusual ways to search for gold in the nearby hills.7The inventor had traveled west for a variety of reasons, particularly his wishto experimentally verify that he could transmit light, information, and power tovast distances by means of wireless. “I wanted to be free of the disturbinginfluences in the city which make it very difficult to tune circuits,” theinventor added.8 Tesla had embarked on a massive plan that presupposed anunderstanding of a technology which even challenges today’s comprehension ofpower-distribution systems. Details of the work would remain secret, Tesla noteven revealing his intent to erect the station until almost the day hedeparted.9From the very first day of his arrival, he announced rather optimistic plans,telling town columnist Mrs. Gilbert McClurg, wife of the secretary of thechamber of commerce, who wrote under the nom de plume Desire Stanton,10 “With[my] wireless telegraph oscillator, [I]…could talk to the inhabitants of theplanet Mars…if they know enough to take a message…and will talk to the people ofthe earth, at any distance away, without the assistance of wires.”11There was a popular notion and even astronomical speculation that other planetswere inhabited and that Mars could be contacted. Growing large fields with floraplanted in different-colored symbols or creating giant reflecting surfaces toflicker signals were two other proposals espoused by writers in the technicaljournals that received serious consideration. With Percival Lowell’s magnificenttelescope only a few hundred miles away, in Flagstaff, Arizona, reports ofMartian activities were a commonplace topic of conversation.With Tesla’s arrival, in Desire’s words, “the day of ‘vril power’ is not fardistant.”“I would light whole cities and give to mere machines all the motions ofintelligence,” said Tesla. “But my first plan is to simply collect experimentaldata, mount instruments and record experiments at different atmospheric levels.”“Tesla’s plan for cabling across the Atlantic is to erect two terminal stations,one in London and one in New York, with the oscillators placed at the top ofhigh towers, communicating thence with great disks suspended in captive balloonsfloating 5,000 feet above the earth to catch the strata of rarefied air throughwhich electrical waves travel most easily. A message could be flashed instantlyby these lightning rays from the oscillator to the disk in the balloon, andacross the thousands of miles of intervening space to the second disk…Mr. Teslasays he is ready to put his wireless system into operation as soon as thepractical details can be arranged.”12His scheme was multifaceted. He could utilize the ionosphere to act as a conduitor a reflector of the electrical waves;13 he could use the intrinsic electricalimpulses of the earth itself, that is, its geomagnetic pulse as a carrier wave,or he could transmit energy in the more conventional wireless way “with onesingle tuned circuit on the transmitting and receiving end,”14 such as he haddemonstrated in his public lectures in London, Paris, New York, Philadelphia,and St. Louis, that is, by using a resonant tuned circuit, comprising atransmitter and a receiver, an aerial and ground connection, or he could useconventional copper lines.15With Colorado Springs six thousand feet above sea level, one of his firstexperiments involved the transmission of very high frequencies up long wires toterminals situated two miles in the sky.16 Helium-filled balloons more than tenfeet long were ordered from a “balloon farm” in Germany run by Professor Meyers,and thousands of feet of wire and cable were shipped from the Houston Streetlab.17Other equipment included batteries, receiving and measuring instruments,switches, transformers, vacuum pumps, and dozens of types of electronic tubesspecially prepared by a Manhattan glassblower. Also, his huge oscillators andgargantuan Tesla coils were shipped, although his novel, flat, spiraltransmitter, which appears so prominently in the 1898 photographs of his NewYork laboratory, was not sent. Louis Uhlman, one of his key engineers, wasplaced in charge of equipment at Houston Street, with George Scherff businessmanager and liaison.Tesla’s wireless experimental station was a large barnlike structureapproximately sixty feet wide and eighteen feet high, with a 200-foot-tallbulbous-topped aerial whose height could be adjusted to differing lengths.Situated on East Pike’s Peak Avenue, within walking distance of the center oftown, the building was connected by transmission lines to the El Paso ElectricalStation only “a few miles away,” From their circuit, Tesla was able “to draw,according to necessity, 100 horse-power and more.”18 Guarded by a sign whichread Great Danger, Keep Out, the lab housed a high-frequency transformer and aTesla coil with a diameter of forty-five feet.19 All of his experiments would becarefully recorded in his private Colorado notebook (which was discovered in the1950s among his papers at the Belgrade Museum). Theories, experiments,occasional personal observations, and highly technical mathematical equationsfilled the pages.20Tesla stated that his main reason for coming to Colorado “was to produce a[resonant transformer] which would be capable of disturbing the electricalcondition [of part], if not the entire globe…thus enabling me to transmitintelligence to great distances without wire.”21 The plan was actually quitesimple; Tesla assumed that the earth had a resonant frequency and thereforecould be measured and utilized as a gigantic carrier wave to distributeelectrical power. Since the entire earth was in a harmonic relationship with hisequipment, Tesla claimed that there would be “no diminution in the intensity ofthe transmitted impulses. It is even possible to make the actions increase withdistance from the plant according to an exact mathematical law.”22By regulating the height of the aerial, different wavelengths could be createdwhich could be measured in terms of their harmonic relationship to the naturalelectrical properties of the earth.A few weeks later, Tesla summoned Fritz Lowenstein. Just twenty-five years oldand a recent German immigrant, Lowenstein had only been working for Tesla for amonth. Thus, there was a question about his ability to be reticent about thework. Nevertheless, he was, as Tesla said, “a man possessed of the highesttechnical training”23 and probably the most formally educated of his crew.In June, Tesla experimented with a wireless telephone, although it is not knownwhether he actually transmitted spoken words.24 To Astor, he wrote, thefollowing year, “There is nothing novel in telephoning without wires to adistance of five or six miles, since this has been done often before…In thisconnection, I have obtained two patents.”25Whether or not Astor was completely aware of Tesla’s plan to leave New York toset up an experimental station in Colorado Springs is unknown. Astor had been inEurope during much of the planning stages of the venture, returning to New Yorkon June 14. Certainly Tesla notified Astor of his plans, but this authorsuspects that the financier did not find out until after their businessarrangement was solidified. As Astor was expecting progress on the oscillatorsand cold light, he probably had mixed feelings when he contacted Scherff tocheck on Tesla’s progress.26Professor Meyers’s balloons had finally arrived. “They should only be abouttwo-thirds inflated,” Meyers warned, “as otherwise they may burst when theyattain some height.”27 “He has also included some kites,” Scherff wrote with theshipment. The balloons were launched in July, “but they [are] too heavy and donot work well.”28 The scheme, although plausible, was cumbersome, as energywould have had to be transmitted up a long wire, which weighed down the balloon(or kite) in a somewhat haphazard fashion, and then another balloon placed atsome distance would be needed to receive the transmission and then send it downlong wires to instruments on the ground. For numerous reasons this line ofinvestigation was abandoned.Next on the agenda was the measurement of the electrical properties of theearth, monitoring electrical storms, and creating electromagnetic oscillationsthat would be in a harmonic relationship to terrestrial currents.Uppermost in Tesla’s mind was the problem of individualization of messages andprotected privacy. Therefore, most of his experiments involved the combinationof two or more frequencies and the construction of receiving instruments tunedto these specific arrangements. “The chief feature of a practical wirelesstelegraph system,” Tesla told Lowenstein, “is the secrecy, immunity andselectivity of the oscillating and receiving apparatus.” The inventor therebyset about to create a variety of mechanisms to produce multiple wavelengths.Whereas Marconi and the others were using inefficient Hertzian “pulsedoscillations at very high frequencies,” Tesla worked with “continuous [undamped]oscillations in the low HF [high-frequency] range.”29“Do you understand what we are now trying to achieve?”“Yes, Mr. Tesla,” Lowenstein replied, “I understand that in this invention theelements of the receiving apparatus respond to the elements of the transmitter,and that only the co-action of the responding of all these elements of thereceiver apparatus make the registering apparatus register.”“Excellent.”30On June 16, Tesla set out to create an efficient ground connection. His workerswere instructed to dig a hole twelve feet deep near a water main, and a copperplate twenty feet square was buried there. “Water was kept constantly flowingupon the ground to moisten it and improve the connection,” but the dry earth andthe problem of rock formations interfered with the creation of a completelyefficient setup. Nevertheless, “purposely unsensitive receiving instrumentsplaced 200 feet from the shop responded when connected to the ground. The actionof the device was strong even though it was concluded that the earth resistancewas still too great.”31For the next series of experiments, Lowenstein was in charge of the transmitter,and Tesla attended to his numerous receivers. Lowenstein recalled, “I handledmyself the big transmitter sending two vibrations through the ground by twoseparate secondary circuits…Mr. Tesla would then…go outside of the buildingleaving me instructions for continuously switching the oscillator on and off incertain intervals…I don’t know how far he went, but by the time he came backagain…[in] the afternoon, you may easily build an idea how far Mr. Tesla couldhave gone at the time I was standing at the switch.”32 In 1916, Tesla statedthat he occasionally conducted experiments as far as ten miles from the station.On the eve of July 4, one of the most stupendous electrical storms ever recordedin the region rocked Pikes Peak. “Observations made last night. They were not tobe easily forgotten for more than one reason. First of all a magnificent sightwas afforded by the extraordinary display of lightning, no less than10,000-12,000 discharges being witnessed inside of two hours…Some…were of awonderful brilliancy and showed often 10 or twice as many branches.”33While tracking the storm with his sensitive receiving apparatus, Tesla noticedthat even though the storm had passed out of sight, the instruments “began toplay periodically.” This was experimental verification of “stationary waves,”periodic electronic vibrations impressed upon the earth itself. Also troughs andnodal points were detected. “It is now certain that they can be produced with anoscillator,” Tesla wrote in his notebook, and then added in brackets, “[This isof immense importance.]”34Tesla wrote to his secretary the same day: “Dear Mr. Scherff, I have receivedmessages from the clouds 100 miles away.” And two days later: “We have justabout finished all [the] details; my work is really to begin in earnest rightnow.”35"},{"pageContent":"26CONTACT (1899) [002-toc.html#ch26]> My dear Luka,> > Everybody is after me since I was favored by the “Martians.”…My friend J.> Collier…has persuaded me to make a short statement regarding the subject of> interplanetary communication.> > Yours sincerely,> Nikola Tesla1The Colorado notebook is virtually a daily record of Tesla’s work at the time.Nowhere in the notes can there be found a distinct passage of the pivotal momentwhen he received unidentified impulses that he came to attribute toextraterrestrials; however, he does refer, on December 8, to this event, writingto friend and columnist Julian Hawthorne: “The art of transmitting electricalenergy through the natural media…will…perhaps make it possible for [man] toproduce…wonderful changes and transformation on the surface of our globe as are,to all evidence, now being wrought by intelligent beings on a neighboringplanet.”2And just a few weeks later, during the holiday season, while still in Colorado,Tesla, in a Christmas message to the local Red Cross Society “when it asked meto indicate one of the great possible achievements of the next hundred years,”3wrote: “I have observed electrical actions, which have appeared inexplicable.Faint and uncertain though they were, they have given me a deep conviction andforeknowledge, that ere long all human beings on this globe, as one, will turn[their] eyes to the firmament above, with the feelings of love and reverence,thrilled by the glad news: ‘Brethren! We have a message from another world,unknown and remote. It reads: one…two…three…’”4Throughout July, Tesla was carefully monitoring the electrical activity of theearth, verifying that it had a specific geomagnetic pulse and harmonics off ofthat pulse. On the twenty-eighth, he worked on increasing the sensitivity of hisreceivers by “magnifying the effects of feeble disturbances.” The inventor hadtuned his equipment so carefully that “in one instance the devices recordedeffects of lightning discharges fully 500 miles away, judging from theperiodical action of the discharges as the storm moved away.”5 Thus, hereasoned, he did not have to test transmitted oscillations by installing areceiver fifty, two hundred, or five hundred miles away, as he was alreadyproving that this could be accomplished simply by monitoring these distantelectrical storms. This was one way Tesla rationalized his decision not toconduct long-distance experiments; he had verification that they would work.6Three days later, on August 1, the inventor departed from writing out hisgrowing file of complex equations to compose a discourse of four thousand wordson the atmosphere and the climate. In these passages, he describes the “bafflingpower of the moonlight” for taking night photographs, the “amazing brilliancy ofthe stars,” magnificent sunsets and shooting stars, the peculiar ability ofvoices to travel several miles from the center of town to his laboratory, the“curious phenomena of the rapid formation and disappearance of cloudformations,” and the numerous unusual shapes that appeared therein.“The days were clear with just enough clouds in the sky to break the monotony ofthe blue,” he wrote. “No wonder…people in feeble health are getting on here sowell…I soon learned there were thousands of consumptives in the place…andconcluded that while this climate is certainly in a wonderful degree healthfuland invigorating, only two kinds of people should come here: Those who have theconsumption and those who want to get it…” Placing himself back into the mood ofscientific observations, he ended the essay with the following line: “But themost interesting of all are the electrical observations which will be describedpresently.”7It appears likely that this sudden burst of poetic reverie could be attributedto the mystical moment he had encountered three nights earlier while monitoringhis equipment alone at the lab.This event, which was to alter his destiny in many ways, as we have seen, didnot come out of the blue. Tesla had been planning for nearly a decade to makecontact.> TALKING WITH THE PLANETS> > Nikola Tesla> > The idea of communicating with other worlds…has been regarded as a poet’s> dream forever unrealizable…> > [Having] perfected the apparatus…for the observation of feeble effects [from]> approaching thunderstorms…so far from my laboratory in the Colorado mountains,> I could feel the pulse of the globe, as it were, noting every electrical> charge that occurred in a radius of eleven hundred miles.> > I can never forget the first sensations I experienced when it dawned upon me> that I had observed something possibly of incalculable consequences to> mankind.

Most likely he first thought that they were periodicoscillations stemming from the thunderstorms that he was monitoring. A few dayslater, it began to dawn upon him that the metronome nature of the beats did notcorrelate with the supposition that they were linked to lightning discharges.The article also speculated that they may have stemmed from Venus or Mars. Twodecades later, in 1921, Tesla wrote:> Others may scoff at this suggestion…[of] communicat[ing] with one of our> heavenly neighbors, as Mars…or treat it as a practical joke, but I have been> in deep earnest about it ever since I made my first observations in Colorado> Springs…> > At the time, there existed no wireless plant other than mine that could> produce a disturbance perceptible in a radius of more than a few miles.> Furthermore, the conditions under which I operated were ideal, and I was well> trained for the work.

Venus or other planets are also mentioned. In the 1921 articlehe says that Venus had been ruled out. Clearly this had to occur over two yearsafter the event, that is, some time after the 1901 article which still includedVenus as a possibility. “After mature thought and study,” Tesla himself dateshis “positive conclusion that they must [have] emanate[d] from Mars” to the year1907.10 In the Red Cross letter and the 1901 article Tesla is very specific inmentioning three beats. In the 1921 article the number of beats is obscured.Julian Hawthorne, who had written to Tesla while he was in Colorado Springs andwho met with Tesla in New York upon his return, also refers to “three fairytaps.” Tesla also alters the facts with regard to competing wireless operators.While Tesla was in Colorado, he received a number of letters from George Scherffconcerning competitors. For example on August 1, 1899:> Dear Mr. Tesla,> > Mr. Clark, the experimenter in wireless telegraphy called this morning seeking> a powerful oscillator or information on how to build one.11In August and September 1899, Scherff continued to inform Tesla about Clark, whocould send messages three miles, thereby obtaining employment by a New Yorknewspaper to report yacht races. Other wireless operators at this time includedProfessor D’Azar in Rome, Professor Marble in Connecticut, and Dr. Riccia inFrance.12 And, of course, there was Guglielmo Marconi, who captured theimagination of the media during the America’s Cup races that autumn. AlthoughScherff wrote, “The New York Times continues to boom Marconi,”13 Teslaconfidently replied, on September 22, 1899, to Scherff, “Do not worry about me.I am about a century ahead of the other fellows.”14Tesla, as one of numerous adherents to the group-fantasy belief that Mars wasinhabited, assumed that the impulses stemmed from there. In 1899 it was franklyinconceivable to him that he could have intercepted a competitor’s message.However, the fact of the matter is that Marconi was transmitting messageshundreds of miles across Europe and the English Channel during the summer of1899 and was using as a signal the Morse-code letter S (dot-dot-dot), whichprecisely corresponds to the three beats Tesla said he intercepted while he wasin Colorado.15On July 28, the very date it has been hypothesized that Tesla received thesignals, Marconi was with the British Admiralty and the French Navy in theEnglish Channel, demonstrating his wireless apparatus between ships in mockbattle maneuvers over distances of thirty miles, fifty-five miles, andeighty-six miles. “On 28 July, Marconi had inspected [the ship] Alexandra’sequipment in preparation for hostilities.”16 Most likely he transmitted theletter S at that time to see if it was picked up by the other warcraft. If Teslawas monitoring his equipment at twelve midnight, it would have been about 8:00A.M. in England, so the times correlate as well.At first, Tesla must have sincerely believed that the source of the impulseswere extraterrestrial, for he boldly stated as much in a series of publishedarticles.17 A few years later, the awful truth dawned upon him. Worse, Tesla mayhave intercepted Marconi’s impulses and made a fool of himself by claiming theyhad derived from superior intelligences. Marconi for Tesla was anathema. In1921, ironically, while Marconi was making headlines by trying himself tointercept messages from nearby planets, Tesla wrote: “I was naturally very muchinterested in [recent] reports that these supposed planetary signals werenothing else than interfering undertones of wireless transmitters. Thesedisturbances I observed for the first time from 1906-1907 occurred rarely, butsubsequently they increased in frequency. Every transmitter emits undertones,and these give by interference long beats, the wavelength being anything from 50miles to 300 or 400 miles.”18This statement supports the hypothesis that the 1899 impulses also stemmed fromsome competitor. Furthermore Tesla suggests the actual mechanism for hisencounter: an undertone effect; and it appears that he unfortunately alsoprovided, through Marconi’s piracy, the very oscillators used to transmit thesignals! The transmitter on the high seas in England, therefore, was attuned tothe receiving equipment in Colorado. Coincidentally, this realization in1906-1907 occurred, as we shall see, during a time of great emotional stress.Rather than face the truth, the mystical Serb clung to a supernaturalexplanation.The most ardent proponent of the outer-space scenario was undoubtedly thejournalist Julian Hawthorne. The son of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Julian authored aseries of elaborate treatises on Tesla’s philosophy, laboratory work,experiments in interplanetary communication, and place in history. Perhapsbecause he had engaged in a spectacular duel of articles with his brother-in-lawGeorge Lathrop, who wrote science-fiction tales about Tom Edison battlinginvaders from Mars in Arthur Brisbane’s New York Journal,19 Hawthorne took upTesla’s extraterrestrial cause.The competition between Edison and Tesla would never abate, and it continuedeven into the realm of science fiction. Like many creative individuals, Edisonhad an interest in the occult. With Charles Batchelor, he had studiedtelepathy,20 and he had worked with spiritualists on a “telephone” tocommunicate with departed souls. Edison was interested in space travel andinterplanetary communication. Lathrop, who had married Julian’s sister, hadworked with Edison since the mid-1890s in cowriting a number of articles thatbecame the precursors to latter-day fantastic tales. In Lathrop’s story“Edison’s Conquest of Mars,” when the Red Planet warriors invaded the earth, theWizard of Menlo Park “invented a disintegrating ray…and it was ‘Edison to theRescue of the Universe.’”21 The son of Nathaniel Hawthorne would not be outdone.> AND HOW WILL TESLA REPLY TO THOSE SIGNALS FROM MARS?> > Julian Hawthorne> > The other day, there happened to Mr. Tesla the most momentous experience that> has ever visited a human being of this earth—three fairy taps, one after the> other, at a fixed interval travelling with the speed of light were received by> Tesla in Colorado from some Tesla on the planet Mars!> > No thoughtful man can have much doubt then, that little as we are aware of it,> we must for ages have been subjected to the direct inspection of the men of> Mars and of the older planets.

Possibly they guide his> development; who can tell?22Perhaps more than any other writer, Hawthorne elevated Tesla to the order of aninterplanetary Adonis whose mystical destiny upon the earth was to give itsinhabitants electrical power, instrumentation, and enlightenment. Note theoverblown yet elegant description Hawthorne pens in meeting with the sorcerer:“Ever and anon there appears a man who is both scientist and poet [who] walkswith feet on the ground but with head among the stars. Men of this mark arerare. Pythagoras was one; Newton must have had a touch of the inspirational; inour own times Tesla is the man…He was born in Herzogovina, of Greek stock, oneof the oldest families there. I believe he is a prince at home.”23Hawthorne interviewed Tesla in the same article in which the inventor reiteratedhis extraterrestrial hypothesis and his technological vision of the future,creating a world in which cheap energy would be available for all and humanitycould begin to take its rightful place in the evolutionary hierarchy. Andalthough Hawthorne tried to introduce some doubt as to the definite reality ofthe extraterrestrial encounter, a quarter of the way through thefive-thousand-word treatise, the writer softened the potential criticism byrationalizing that “the hopes Tesla holds out embody things that ought to betrue; that would immensely enlarge and beautify the world if they were true…”Concluding with a rhetorical question, Hawthorne wrote, “And what aboutconversing with Mars?…Tesla will do what he was sent here to do.”Backed by the opposition, factions of the press also lashed out vigorously. Onesevere critic, under the byline of a mysterious Mr. X, cautioned “intelligentreaders”: “Mr. Tesla obviously wants to figure in the newspapers. Everyone wouldbe greatly interested if it were true that signals are being sent from Mars.Unfortunately, he has not adduced a scrap of evidence to prove it…Hisspeculations on science are so reckless as to lose an interest. Hisphilosophizing is so ignorant as to be worthless.”24While in Colorado, Tesla negotiated with officials of the U.S. Navy and LightHouse Board, with nine letters passing between them from the spring of 1899 and,upon his return to New York, through the autumn of 1900.25 On May 11, Rear Adm.Francis J. Higginson of the U.S. Navy wrote Tesla a letter which was forwardedto Colorado:> Dear Sir:> > I would like to ask you if you can not arrange to establish a system of> wireless telegraphy upon the Light-Vessel No. 66, Nantucket Shoals, Mass.,> which lies off about 60 miles south of Nantucket Island.26Higginson stated explicitly, “The Light-House Board [has] no money…[so funding]will have to be paid from some outside source.”Tesla sent his “humble apologies for a tardy reply,” because of a “severe cold,”and then ended the note with this seemingly innocuous line: “[It] is also mysincere hope that I am not standing in the way of some other expert moredeserving and better able to fulfill the task than myself.”27The statement strikes this investigator as odd. Why would Tesla write that hewas potentially “standing in the way of some other expert more deserving” whenhe knew that this was a completely false statement. No other expert was moredeserving or more knowledgeable than he. Moreover, he knew that it was verylikely that other experts were pirating his work, so why would he encourage moreof that activity? This was clearly a self-deprecating and self-destructiveelement. Be that as it may, the response from Commander Perry, Higginson’sassociate, was just as peculiar:> Office of the Light House Board> Washington, D.C. 16 August ‘99.> > Mr. N. Tesla> Experimental Station,> Colorado Springs, Col.> Sir:> > In acknowledging the receipt of your letter of 11 Aug. ’99…from certain> expressions used in it the Board fears there may be some misunderstanding, so> in order to prevent you from going to any trouble of expense, the board> desires to say that it has taken no action as yet toward providing any> apparatus for using wireless telegraphy, as no appreciation is available for> the purpose…> > When it does take up the question of installing apparatus for communicating> with light-vessels, your great name and fame in such matters will insure> earnest consideration of yourself.> > Respectfully yours,> T. Perry, Commander, U.S.N.Apparently, Commander Perry read into Tesla’s letter information that wasn’tthere. The inventor did not discuss reimbursement but took the opportunity inanother letter to chastise Perry for his miserly response, writing on August 20,1899, from his “Experimental Station” in Colorado Springs, to the Light HouseBoard, Washington, D.C.:> Gentlemen,> > …On this occasion permit me to avail myself of my> > acquired and precious prerogative as a citizen of the United States and to> express my deep astonishment that, in a country of such vast wealth, and> leading in enlightenment, so important a body as the Light House Board,> instead of being provided with unlimited resources, should be trivially> hampered and placed in…such an awkward position.> > Very respectfully yours,> N. Tesla28Although clever, Tesla’s response was short-sighted, as the benefits that wouldaccrue from installing wireless apparatus on this boat would clearly outweighany short-term loss. The equipment would have been far more advanced thanMarconi’s, the press and public would see, without doubt, Tesla’s superiority,and other branches of the navy and armed forces would have created contractswith the inventor. Furthermore, it would have been the first publicdemonstration by Tesla of long-distance wireless telegraphy. Unfortunately,throughout Tesla’s long career, he never demonstrated this capability to anyoneother than himself.Nevertheless, Tesla’s letter did not destroy his chances with the LighthouseBoard. On September 14, Commander Perry responded by offering Tesla the contractbecause the navy “preferred to award home talent” over Marconi.29Here was the opportunity of a lifetime. Certainly it was understandable thatTesla needed to stay in Colorado through the autumn. He would return to New Yorkthe first week of January 1900. The Colorado experiment was a costly endeavor,and the inventor had now built up momentum, pushing toward the grand conclusion,that is, his wish to send impulses around the globe. Perry wanted action“quickly.” But asking him to delay ninety days would not have been anunreasonable request. However, from the emotional point of view, Perry had saidthe wrong thing. He had mentioned the name of Signor Marconi.> Gentlemen,> > …Much as I value your advances I am compelled to say, in justice to myself,> that I would never accept a preference on any ground, the merit of my own work> excepted, particularly not in this case, as I would be competing against some> of those who are following in my path and as any pecuniary advantage which I> might derive by availing myself of the privilege, is a matter of the most> absolute indifference to me.> > But since you have reasons for preference, permit me to state…that a few years> ago I laid down certain novel principles on “wireless telegraphy” which I have> been since perfecting.Tesla went on to describe the seven features of his system: (1) an oscillator;(2) a ground and elevated circuit; (3) a transmitter; (4) a resonant receiver;(5) a transformer “that scientific men have honored me by identifying it with myname” (Tesla coil); (6) a powerful conduction coil; (7) a transformer in thereceiving apparatus. Having “carefully perused all the reports of the moresuccessful experimenters as they appeared,” Tesla discovered that “they are allusing, with religious care, these devices and principles, without the slightestdeparture, even in minor details…” He ended the letter by offering his servicesonce again but requesting that the navy purchase an even dozen transmitters,with the caution that> in the end one is apt to be accused of making outrageous prices. It is more> than probable that my apparatus will cost more than that offered by others as> I look to every detail myself.> > With many thanks for your good intentions I remain,> > Very respectfully yours,> N. Tesla30The navy never responded to this letter. One year later, on October 4, 1900,Tesla wrote Admiral Higginson. Four days later, the admiral responded: “Itwill…be necessary before asking Congress for money to carry on this work to havefurther estimates of cost.”Tesla’s style of writing to the navy was particularly irritating and filled withcontradictions. He claims to be “absolutely indifferent” to gaining a “pecuniaryadvantage,” and yet he tells Commander Perry that the cost might appear to be“outrageous.” At the dawning stage of a completely new industry, instead ofbuilding one or two prototypes to display before the government, Tesla insistson a sizable order. In an early letter he states that he does not want to standin the way of any competitor; in another he claims he did not know there wereany other competitors. In one passage, he accuses all his competitors of piracy(which was probably true), and yet in another he wishes them “hearty success.”His position was incongruous to say the least, and it served to scuttle his owncause. This would turn out to be one of the most significant blunders of hiscareer."},{"pageContent":"27THOR’S EMISSARY (1899) [002-toc.html#ch27]> Th[e] problem was rendered extremely difficult, owing to the immense> dimensions of the planet…But by gradual and continuous improvements of a> generator of electrical oscillations…I finally succeeded in reaching rates of> delivery of electrical energy actually surpassing those of lightning> discharges…By use of such a generator of stationary waves and receiving> apparatus properly placed and adjusted in any other locality, however remote,> it is practicable to transmit intelligible signals, or to control or actuate> at will any one apparatus for many other important and valuable purposes.> > NIKOLA TESLA1Tesla went to Colorado in part for reasons of secrecy. His allimportanttransmitting oscillators and general design had already been pirated, and hewould shortly be involved in a variety of priority battles. Looking at theColorado project from the technical point of view, the inventor was in a virginfield and needed to experiment in order to determine a workable plan fordistributing light, information, and power by means of wireless. The measuringof standing waveforms from the electrical storms throughout July confirmed whathe had suspected, namely, that the earth had a resonant frequency and couldtherefore be used as a carrier wave to transmit his signals.Letters between Scherff and Tesla continued on an almost daily basis throughoutthe summer. In August, Tesla received an “invitation to attend the banquethonoring the birthday of the Emperor Francis Joseph.”2 Correspondence also camein from Austria, India, Australia, and Scandinavia. “The [last] one,” Scherffwrote, “is a proposition to become agent or manufacturer of your new light forSweden, Norway and Denmark.”3 To the numerous business inquiries, Tesla wrote,“[Tell them] that I am on a scientific expedition, and will return in a fewweeks.”4 There was also correspondence with William Rankine, E. D. Adams, Mr.Coaney (a stockholder), and Alfred Brown.Bills were forwarded, and the inventor, in turn, would periodically mail offfunds to cover these expenses. Wages for the crew ran about ninety dollars a payperiod. The New York laboratory, in turn, prepared new equipment to be shippedwest, as Scherff continued to send details about their construction.> September 6, 1899> > Dear Mr. Scherff,> > Can you write about something more interesting than the> > pump. There are many things happening in a great city…[Try]> > and make your correspondence more interesting…[such as in sending] press> clippings.> > Sincerely,> N. Tesla5As was his custom, the inventor lived in the future, writing to Scherff in lateAugust that he expected to return to New York in a few weeks. It would be morelike four months. At the same time, Lowenstein requested permission to takeleave, as he wanted to return to Germany for some family matter. Tesla fearedthat he might be an industrial spy, but he was only going home to get married.Koleman Czito was called on to replace him.“Czito has just arrived,” Tesla wrote, “and I [am] glad to see a familiar faceagain. He looks a little too fat for the work I expect of him.”6 He would comejust in time to take part in some of the most spectacular electrical experimentsever performed. A hearty and trustworthy companion, Czito would stay at Tesla’scall until he was an old man. By that time, he had trained his son Julius totake over. Julius would eventually come to aid Tesla in some of his moreclandestine earth-lunar experiments as well as in dayto-day responsibilities.7Throughout September, Tesla designed a large number of electronic tubes for hisglassblower in New York to fashion, and for Scherff to ship, as he continued todocument his work with a local photographer. Electrical energy generatedexceeded 3 million volts. Tesla reported, “I drew 1-inch sparks between my bodyand an iron pipe buried in the ground about 100 feet from the laboratory.”8On the twenty-ninth, time-lapse pictures were mailed to John Jacob Astor, sugarrefinery king, H. D. Havemeyer, his wife and their daughter, Mrs. E. F. Winslow,Stanford White, socialite Mary Mapes Dodge, and the Johnsons. He also shippedcopies to Lord Kelvin, Sir William Crookes, Sir James Dewar, William Roentgen,Philip Lenard, and Adolph Slaby.9 “Look them over carefully before delivery,”the inventor instructed his liaison, “and do not allow the workers, other thanyourself and Mr. Ulman to see them.”10Throughout the autumn, the inventor continued to change the height of the ballat the top of the antenna to measure the change in capacity and relationship togenerated wavelengths in order to tune the equipment to the earth’s frequencyand “bring the oscillator into resonance with th[e] circuit.”11 Made out ofwood, the ball was coated with metal. He also studied the strange phenomena offireballs, which, when created by natural means, can appear like tumbleweeds oflightning that can roll down a street and smash into a tree or house. They arerarely seen, though there are documented sightings. Although Tesla himself hadnot witnessed any natural fireballs, he was able to create smaller ones in hislab. “Sometimes it apeared [sic] as if a ball would form above the coil, butthis may have been only an optical effect caused by many streamers passing fromvarious points in different directions…At [other] times, a big cluster of themwould form and spatter irregularly in all directions.”12 “He produced them quiteby accident and saw them, more than once, explode and shatter his tall mast andalso destroy apparatus within his laboratory. The destructive actionaccompanying the disintegration of a fire ball, he declared, takes place withinconceivable violence.”13In one instance, he pushed the experiments too far, and a fire started. Trappedby streamers that could maim or kill, the inventor had to roll to safety to savehis life. To Johnson he wrote, “I have had wonderful experiences here, amongother things, tamed a wild cat and am nothing but a mass of bleeding scratches.But in the scratches, Luka, there lies a mind. MIND.”14A few weeks later, while a photographer was present, Tesla set the roof inflames but was able to extinguish it before much damage was done. “The displaywas wonderful in spite of this,” he wrote in his diary.15Having studied the phenomena, Tesla attributed the generation of fireballs to“the interaction of two frequencies, a stray higher frequency wave imposed onthe lower frequency free oscillation of the main circuit.” They could also beproduced when “stray high frequency charges from random earth currents”interacted with charges from his oscillator.16The following week, he extended the ball to a height of 142 feet and began“propagating waves through the ground.”17> Referring to electrical or radio wave action at a distance, I know from> experience that if proper precautions are not taken, fires of all kinds and> explosions can be produced by wireless transmitters.

By increasing the frequency between pulsations,the inventor claimed to be able to boost horsepower to a few hundred thousand,although this amount of produced energy would last only a fraction of asecond.21Czito arrived for work one day in mid-autumn to find the inventor vigorouslywatering the ground around the metal plate which he had buried near the lab. “IfI could only insulate these wires with liquid oxygen, I could reduce lossesanother magnitude,” the inventor said. “Here, put these on.” He gave Czito apair of rubber-soled shoes as he laced up a pair for himself.“All the way today, sir?” Czito inquired.“To the limit, my friend. Now remember,” the inventor cautioned, “keep one handbehind your back at all times.”Czito responded with a nod of his head. He had no plans to risk electrocution bycreating a circuit through his heart.“Throw the switch when you see my signal.”“We had better use these, sir.” Czito handed his boss two cotton balls and tooktwo for himself, and they plugged them into their ears.The lanky Serb lumbered from his lab in his high shoes, past the mud, to placetesting equipment and cold lamps at various locations in the earth, andpositioned himself on a knoll about a mile away, near Prospect Lake. Even thoughinsulated, sparks jumped from the ground to his feet as he crunched along thepath.22The sun was low on the horizon as Colorado Springs began to turn on streetlightsand electric lamps in preparation for the night. “Now,” Tesla waved as Czitofired up the equipment.The sound began as a low rumble and built to a “roar [that] was so strong thatit could be plainly heard ten miles away.” The ground trembled with the noise asthe inventor gazed over to a nearby corral to watch a half-dozen horses rear ontheir hind legs and gallop frantically away. “Butterflies were carried aroundin…circle[s] as in a [whirlpool] and could not get out, no matter how hard theytried,”23 as the flume of streamers stormed up the shaft high above the roof ofthe lab and blustered out from the apex, splitting lightning bolts fully 135feet in length. Kaboom! Zip! Zap! Kaboom! Looking to the sky, the wizard heldhis wireless torches up in triumph as they flickered in his thunder.The end came abruptly, the Springs plunged into darkness. He had shorted out thetown.Fortunately “the powerhouse had a second, standby generator which was started upsoon after. Tesla was insistent that he be supplied with current from thisreserve machine as soon as it was running, but his demand was refused.” Forcedby El Paso Electric to fix the damaged generator himself, the inventor was backon line in a day or two. “In the future, he was told, he would be supplied withcurrent from a dynamo operated independently from the one supplying the [El PasoElectric] company’s regular customers.”24By the end of 1899, Tesla was ready to return to New York. He wanted to get homefor the holidays, to spend them with the Johnsons, but it would take him alittle longer to wind things down. In December, he sent for his photographer,Dickenson Alley, to capture his work in the best possible light. By usingmultiple exposures, Alley would create what is perhaps Tesla’s most famousphotograph: that of the inventor sitting calmly reading a book, dwarfed bymyriad tongues of explosive lightning. (This picture is a multiple exposure.Tesla, of course, was not sitting there at the time the oscillator was fired up;the electricity would have killed him.)> December 22, 1899> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > We will keep your memory green Christmas day…How lovely it would be if you> should suddenly appear in our midst…to spend it with us…> > I sometimes wonder if you could make me glad again, just to see you, it is so> long since gladness has been in my days.

Duffner and another watchman to look after thelaboratory, the inventor departed with inexplicit promises for future payment.His funds exhausted, he also left without covering outstanding bills he hadincurred with the local power company.2The Johnsons were thrilled with the wizard’s return, and they celebrated ingrand style by dining out. With Gilder’s approval, Robert suggested that Teslacompose a discourse on his recent endeavors.Coincidentally, Marconi was in Manhattan seeking investors and planning onlecturing on his progress in wireless.3 “When I sent electrical waves from mylaboratory in Colorado, around the world,” Tesla reported, “Mr. Marconi wasexperimenting with my apparatus unsuccessfully at sea. Afterward, Mr. Marconicame to America to lecture on this subject, stating that it was he who sentthose signals around the Globe. I went to hear him, and when he learned that Iwas present he became sick, postponed the lecture, and up to the present timehas not delivered it.”4Although fearful of Tesla, Marconi was also desirous of obtaining a greaterunderstanding of the master’s equipment. With Michael Pupin as intermediary,Marconi was introduced to Tesla at the New York Science Club.5 Pupin was inexceptionally high spirits, as John S. Seymour, commissioner of patents hadfinally retired. After six years of submissions, in his attempts to try andprove that his understanding of resonance and harmonics in the field of ACtransmission superseded Tesla’s, he had finally won. In December 1899 he appliedonce again for his patent, “The Art of Reducing Attenuation of ElectricalWaves,” and the new commissioner, Walter Johnson, sanctioned it.6 Apparentlyjust one month later, the trio left after dinner to visit Tesla’s lab. GeorgeScherff was working late and greeted them at the door.“I remember [Marconi] when he was coming to me asking me to explain the functionof my transformer for transmission of power to great distances,” Tesla recalled.Although the inventor obviously had mixed feelings about the meeting, henevertheless obliged with a discourse on the difference between Hertzianradiations and Tesla currents. “Mr. Marconi said, after all my explanations ofthe application of my principle, that it is impossible.”“Time will tell, Mr. Marconi,” Tesla shot back.7 Pupin was able to usher Marconito the door before discussions became more heated.“I understand completely what you are doing, Mr. Marconi,” Pupin began as hewalked the young Italian back to his hotel. “I would like very much to act as aconsultant in your operation.”“That would be an honor,” Marconi said as he discussed with Pupin a way to“persuade Signor Edison to come aboard.” Marconi’s reason, in particular, was toobtain Edison’s grasshopper patent, which described a wireless way for jumpingmessages from train stations to moving trains and which Edison patented in the1880s.Pupin was elated. Not only was he becoming professionally involved in anexciting international wireless enterprise; he had also begun to cash in on hisnew AC patent. In June, Pupin received a $3,000 advance for selling the rightsto John E. Hudson, president of AT&T, and a few months later he negotiated foryearly payments of $15,000 per year, for an amount totaling $200,000 for theinvention Commissioner Seymour called “tautological” and “no more…than amultiplication of Tesla’s circuit [that utilized principles] well understood inthe art.”8 In either case, the patent enabled AT&T to perfect long-distancetelephone transmissions and provided Pupin with a handsome income for many yearsto come. It also vindicated his position that he had understood Tesla’sinvention better than Tesla did.Tesla tried again to interest the submarine designer John Holland intelautomatics; he also worked to fashion “dirigible wireless torpedoes” or smallairships which could be controlled from the ground. “Everybody who saw them,” herevealed a few years later, “was amazed at their performance.”9After putting together a prospectus and conferring with his lawyers, theinventor packed his bags for Washington to speak in person with AdmiralHigginson of the Light House Board and Secretary John D. Long of the navy. Heplanned not only to offer his “devil telautomata” but also a scheme for“establish[ing] wireless telegraphic communication across the Pacific.” Met withridicule and skepticism, the inventor was shuffled into what Mark Twain called“the circumlocution office.” “My ideas,” Tesla said, “were thrown in the navalwaste basket…Had only a few ‘telautomatic’ torpedoes been constructed andadopted by our navy, the mere moral influence of this would have been powerfullyand most beneficially felt in the present Eastern complication [the Japanese warwith Russia].”10Tesla had hoped at least that the U.S. Coast Guard or Navy would come through ona smaller scale by financing the construction of modest-sized transmitters fortheir lighthouses and ships, but the agencies dodged any serious commitment andcontinued to hide behind a bureaucratic quagmire involving the need forcongressional approval.11“I’ve circumscribed the globe with electrical impulses,” he told Scherff uponhis return. “Let them have the Hertzian dabblers. They’ll come back around myway soon enough.”“What will you do with Professor Pupin, stealing your work in alternatingcurrent?”“He’s involved in sending voice over wires,” the inventor replied. “Who can bebothered.”It was at this time that Tesla commissioned an agent in Britain to locate anappropriate place for constructing a receiving station,12 as he continued torework blueprints for his transoceanic broadcasting system. Using his Englishroyalties as collateral, he asked George Westinghouse for a loan of a fewthousand dollars; he also tried to interest him in the wireless enterprise.13Westinghouse, however, declined to get involved, but he did advance the inventorthe requested funds, even though his company had overextended themselves nearly$70 million in their rapid expansion and changeover to the polyphase system.Incessant legal fees due to the never-ending litigation on patent prioritybattles, mostly with the countless subsidiaries were also a great drain. Swissemigrant B. A. Behrend, author of one of the early standard textbooks on ACmotors, wrote in his treatise that much to the chagrin of New England Granite’s(a GE subsidiary) patent attorney, he refused to testify against Tesla, “as suchevidence would be against [his] better convictions.”14This letter was written in 1901, a full year after Judge Townsend’s unequivocalruling vindicated Tesla as the sole author of the AC polyphase system (seechapter 3).15 Now Westinghouse could finally begin to collect damages and payback its enormous debt. George Westinghouse sent Tesla a thank you notecongratulating himself “for winning the suit” and congratulating Tesla for being“awarded the credit for a great invention.” Westinghouse ended the letter asfollows “You know I appreciate your sympathetic interest in my affairs.”16In the early part of 1900, Tesla filed for three patents related to wirelesscommunication.17 He made several attempts to contact the elusive Colonel Astorbut concentrated most of his efforts on working on an article for the Century.Robert had requested that Tesla write an educational piece about telautomaticsand wireless communication. The plan was to decorate the essay with photographsof the remote-controlled boat and the inventor’s fantastic experiments inColorado, but Tesla had other ideas. Influenced by Western philosophersFriedrich Nietzche and Arthur Schopenhauer about such ideas as the creation ofthe Übermensch through activation of the will and renunciation of desire and byEastern philosophers such as Swami Vivekananda on the link between the soul andGodhead, Prâna (life force) and Akâsha (ether) and its equivalence to theuniverse, force, and matter,18 the inventor decided to compose aonce-in-a-lifetime apocalyptic treatise on the human condition and technology’srole in shaping world history.Robert pleaded with him “not to write a metaphysical article, but rather aninformative one,” but Tesla would not listen. Instead, he sent back atwelve-thousand-word discourse which covered such topics as the evolution of therace, artificial intelligence, the possibility of future beings survivingwithout the necessity of eating food, the role of nitrogen as a fertilizer,telautomatics, alternative energy sources (e.g., terrestrial heat, wind, and thesun), a description of how wireless communication can be achieved, hydrolysis,problems in mining, and the concept of the plurality of worlds.Robert was now in a bind. Neither he nor Gilder wanted to publish a lengthy,controversial, abstract philosophical essay which might damage the magazine.However, they could not simply cross out sections they were unhappy with, forthey were dealing with a man who was born a genius and a friend who hadcontributed two previous gems that added greatly to the prestige of theirpublication. How to approach the hypersensitive savant was a difficult problemwhich Robert did not relish.> March 6, 1900> > Dear Tesla,> > I just can’t see you misfire this time.

Tesla20Tesla knew what he was doing. He had decided, once and for all, to put down asignificant percentage of the knowledge he had amassed into one treatise, andthere was no way he was going to change it. Most likely Robert conferred withGilder. Clearly, the essay was brilliant and original, and the more they readit, the more they realized its many layers of wisdom. The best tack to take atthis point, they reasoned, was to work to clarify the piece by usingsubheadings, by including all of the startling electrical photos from Colorado,and the telautomaton, and by having Tesla more carefully explain the details ofhis inventions, and then hope for the best. The published essay began asfollows:> THE ONWARD MOVEMENT OF MAN> > Of all the endless variety of phenomena which nature presents to our senses,> there is none that fills our minds with greater wonder than that inconceivably> complex movement which, in its entirety, we designate as human life. Its> mysterious origin is veiled in the forever impenetrable mist of the past, its> character is rendered incomprehensible by its infinite intricacy, and its> destination is hidden in the unfathomable depths of the future.Inherent in the structure matter, as seen in the growth of crystals, is alife-forming principle. This organized matrix of energy, as Tesla comprehendedit, when it reaches a certain stage of complexity, becomes biological life. Now,the next step in the evolution of the planet was to construct machines so thatthey could think for themselves, and so Tesla created the first prototype, histeleautomaton. Life-forms need not be made out of flesh and blood.As an environmentalist, Tesla was concerned about personal hygiene, air andwater pollution, and the needless waste of natural resources. Throughconcentration on energy problems, solutions could be achieved. Thus, many ofTesla’s inventions were created specifically to maximize efficient use of energyand prove out the principle that a self-directed thinking machine could alterthe course of civilization by gaining greater control over the evolution of theplanet.In the middle of the treatise, the inventor explained in vivid detail themechanism behind his wireless transmitter. Numerous photographs of hisexperiments at Colorado Springs also enhanced the impact of the message.Thirty-five pages later, he ended the treatise with a discussion of thecognitive hierarchy and the speculation that “intelligent beings on Mars…ifthere are [any]” most likely utilize a wireless energy-distribution system thatinterconnects all corners of their planet. Tesla concluded: “The scientific mandoes not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideaswill be readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter—for the future.His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point theway.”21When the article appeared in the June issue of the Century, it created asensation. Tesla circulated advance copies to friends, such as Mrs. DouglasRobinson, one of the founders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,22 JulianHawthorne, Stanford White, and John Jacob Astor. In Astor’s case, Tesla includedhis wireless patent applications, forwarding “this matter to your home, insteadof your office [for secrecy reasons]…The patents give me an absolute monopoly inthe United States not only for power purposes,” the inventor continued inanother letter to the colonel, “but also for establishing telegraphiccommunication…no matter how great the distance.”23 Those who were Teslasupporters rallied around him, Nature gave it a “favorable response,” and theFrench quickly translated it for their readers,24 but those who were against himnow had a new supply of ammunition for a frontal assault.The stage was set in March 1900, when Carl Hering was elected president of theAIEE; Professor Pupin was a close second.25 Hering, who would also become editorin chief of Electrical World & Engineer, set a new tone for the electricalcommunity. Just as he had called into question Tesla’s priority work on AC adecade before, when he had backed Dobrowolsky, he also challenged Tesla’scredibility in the field of wireless. Other opponents included ReginaldFessenden, who was trying to obtain competing patents on tuned circuits, andsuch traditional rivals as Lewis Stillwell, Charles Steinmetz, Tom Edison, andElihu Thomson. The first potshots appeared in the Evening Post26 and then inPopular Science Monthly.Tesla had suggested that the sum total of human energy on the planet, which hecalled M, could be multiplied by its “velocity,” V, which was measured bytechnological and social progress. Just as in physics, the total human forcecould be calculated as MV2. If humans go against the laws of religion andhygiene, the total human energy would diminish. In a primitive or agrarian-basedsociety the energy would progress arithmetically. However, if the new generationhad a “higher degree of enlightenment,” then the “sum total of human energy”would increase geometrically. Tesla was suggesting that with his inventions ofthe induction motor, AC power transmission, and his remote-controlled robots,human progress would evolve at ever increasing rates.In a highly visible discourse under the banner title “Science and Fiction,” ananonymous writer with the nom de plume “Physicist” vehemently attacked thispremise. “Unhappily,” this critic wrote, “Mr. Tesla in his enthusiasm toprogress…neglects to state which direction is the proper one for the human massto follow, north, south, east, west, toward the moon or Sirius or to Dante’sSatan in the centre of the earth…Of course, the whole notion…is absurd.”The editorial, which continued for six columns, called into question Tesla’sinvention of the telautomaton, his belief that fighting machines would replacesoldiers on the field—“international bull-fights…or potatoraces might do just aswell”—his work in wireless, and his support for the plurality of worldshypothesis. The author suggested that the Century, in future issues, shouldsubject these types of articles to a scientific board “for criticism andrevision if only for the protection against bogus inventions and nonsensicalenterprises.” Hurling epithets as if in combat with a mortal enemy, “Physicist”concluded, “The editors [of the Century] apparently impute to their readers adesire to be entertained at all costs…They evidently often do not know sciencefrom rubbish and apparently seldom make any effort to find out thedifference.”27The onslaught continued in Science and in a follow-up editorial again in PopularScience Monthly, this time by a mysterious “Mr. X.”“Science (Pseudo) contains an article from xxx. ‘Physicist’ is not in it,” Teslawrote to Johnson, adding sarcastically, “It is also highly complimentary to theeditors of your great magazine.”28 Other daily papers also attacked theinventor’s controversial claims.Tesla, however, maintained a blind eye to this credibility problem andaudaciously or foolheartedly followed up this article with the infamous piece“Talking With the Planets” in Colliers, which we reviewed in an earlier chapter.Making no secret of his identity, Reginald Fessenden, who was now embroiled in alegal dispute with Tesla, vehemently wrote in Hering’s journal that the sourceof “the so-called Martian signals have long been known…and only the crassestignorance could attribute any such origin.” Having at one time been “a seriousobstacle to multiplex systems, [they are now all but] eliminated.” Fessendensaid the signals were due to “street cars, lightning flashes and the gradualelectriciation of the aerial. Furthermore, the different kinds are easilydistinguishable. Those ignorant of the subject might mistake them forintelligent signals.”29Ever since his return to New York, Tesla made repeated efforts to rekindle hisfriendship with Astor, but the gadabout was proving difficult to corner. Overthe summer, the Johnsons tried to woo the inventor to Maine for a vacation, buthe was too intent on contacting the multimillionaire.image 5 [images/image-05.jpg]Nikola Tesla at the height of his fame in 1894image 6 [images/image-06.jpg]Above The Chicago World’s Fair at night, illuminated by Westinghouse Corporationutilizing the Tesla AC polyphase system.image 7 [images/image-07.jpg](Opposite above) Tesla displaying wireless fluorescent tubes before the RoyalSociety in England, 1892.image 8 [images/image-08.jpg](Opposite below) Thomas Edison (center) at his Menlo Park invention factory.Seated to Edison’s left is Charles Batchelor, key partner and the man whointroduced Tesla to Edison, probably in France in 1883.(Right) Thomas Commerford Martin, editor of the 1893 text The Inventions,Researches, and Writings of Nikola Tesla, the only collected works producedduring Tesla’s lifetime.

Tesla shot off another round of letters outlining his progresswith his oscillators, fluorescent light—“the commercial value…if rightlyexplored, is simply immense”—and wireless enterprise,33 but again Astor balked.Astor never directly told Tesla his real feelings. His reluctance in advancingthe partnership suggests that he was angry with Tesla for not exploiting theoscillators and fluorescent lights in 1899, as he had promised, but had insteadrun off to Colorado Springs to conduct his wireless folly.Certainly the onslaught in the papers injured Tesla’s reputation, but it is thisauthor’s belief that the attack by the press had little if anything to do withAstor’s turnabout. Tesla had deceived him. As wealthy as he was, Astor wanted toinvest in a sure thing. The oscillators and the fluorescent lights seemedpractically ready for market, but rather than perfect these inventions, Teslatook the capital to go off on another venture and returned without a dime. Astorwas enraged but too much of a gentleman to even let Tesla know. With StanfordWhite and Mrs. Douglas Robinson behind him, Tesla explored a fresh lead."},{"pageContent":"29THE HOUSE OF MORGAN (1901) [002-toc.html#ch29]> J. P. Morgan towered above all the Wall Street people like Samson over the> Philistines.> > NIKOLA TESLA1In May 1900, Gentleman Jim Corbett was KO’d by James Jeffries in a championshipbout held in Coney Island. Tesla, an avid boxing fan, probably attended. Back atthe hotel, a Serbian youth with a familiar name had left a message. It wasAnna’s son, the one and only girl Tesla had ever fallen in love with. Throughthe years they had maintained contact, so Tesla had been notified of the boy’sarrival. However, he was not prepared for the career that the lad had chosen.“I want to be a boxer,” the boy proclaimed.Unnerved by this announcement, Tesla conferred with Stanford, who helped set upthe youth at a boxing school near the Garden. Every so often Tesla would go downto the gym to follow the boy’s progress; finally, it was decided that he wasready to enter the ring. Stanford had done his best to set up a reasonablematch, but the youth persisted in seeking out a tougher opponent.One blow knocked the boy unconscious, and he died shortly thereafter in thehospital. “Tesla grieved for him as though he was his own son.”2In the fall of 1900, J. Pierpont Morgan announced the wedding of his daughterLouisa to Herbert Satterlee, Morgan’s latter-day biographer. It was amagnificent event with a guest list numbering twenty-four hundred. The Serbianwunderkind felt quite at home at the gala occasion, for many of his friends werethere, including John Jacob and Lady Astor, Mrs. Douglas Robinson and herbrother Teddy Roosevelt (whom Tesla had met at Mrs. Robinson’s Madison Avenuehome in March of 1899), William Rankine, Edward Dean Adams, Darius Ogden Mills,Chauncey DePew, and Stanford White. Other guests included Jacob Schiff, HenryClay Frick, Grover Cleveland, August Belmont, President William McKinley, andThomas Edison. Morgan was in an exceedingly good mood and personally greetedeach guest with a warm handshake.3 “I read your article in the Century, Mr.Tesla, and was very impressed.”Coincident with Tesla’s impending liaison with the House of Morgan and recenttriumphant return from Colorado Springs, his handwriting and signature began todisplay a frivolous abundance of ornate embellishments. Although these sampleswere written in moments of gaiety in letters to the Johnsons,4 they neverthelessreveal a subconscious, qualitative change in his state of mind as compared tohis usual lean, bare-bones handwriting. Graphologists note that “the paper [is]frequently treated as a substitute object…[Thus] the graphically expansive[writers]…usually are the same who not only dominate the paper, but also theirenvironment, [just as] the graphically timid ones are also timid in otherrespects.”5One could therefore speculate that Tesla was a very visible character at theaffair. And just as Tesla adorned his signature, he adorned his body, wearingthe latest suits, top hat, cane, and white gloves. He took extreme pride inbeing the leader of his field and one of the best-dressed men to walk FifthAvenue. Now tending toward flamboyance, the inventor began to identify moreheartily with the opulence and power that surrounded him.Twenty-eight-year-old Anne Tracy Morgan, Louisa’s younger sister, wasparticularly taken with the dashing inventor, and they began a friendship.“The Thanksgiving dinner at [Morgan’s home that] year was an unusually large andgay affair with its traditional four varieties of pies,”6 and Tesla was invitedto the day-after event, held Friday evening.7 Anne may have seen this as anopportunity to extend their friendship; they would come to exchange letters forthe duration of their lives—but Tesla saw it as a business opportunity. Thewizard brought along fascinating multicolored electric bulbs that emanateddancing spiderwebs of lightning, static-electricity devices that made a person’shair stand on end, and other wireless paraphernalia. The inventor exchangedhellos with J. P. Morgan Jr., now in his early thirties, and gave photographs ofhis work at Colorado Springs to Anne.After dinner, Morgan met Tesla privately in order to discuss a possiblepartnership. The tenor of the times is discussed by Herbert Satterlee, a man whoknew Tesla personally. Having written a virtual daily log of Morgan’s life,Satterlee deliberately deleted any reference to the Morgan-Tesla liaison; butthe following paragraph, which coincides precisely with this time, appears to bea justification for the financier’s decision to back the wireless venture: “Thedying year saw the completion of many combinations of the smaller companies inthe steel industry…They were all getting rich. Gates was speculating in WallStreet. Judge Moore began to buy fine horses…Conversely, Reid and the othersinvested in large country estates…[And Morgan gambled on an oddball inventor.]Dinners at the Waldorf-Astoria and at Sherry’s and lavish entertainments werethe order of the day, and everywhere there was evidence of rapidly accumulatedwealth. They all seemed to think that there was no end to it.”8Known among the clique for his collection of mistresses, Morgan extended hispassion to amassing an immense hoard of treasures, including ancient coins,precious stones, tapestries, carvings, rare plates, the paintings of themasters, statues, old books, and original manuscripts. Some of his most prizedpossessions included first drafts of Charles Dickens’s novels, a portrait ofNicolaes Ruts by Rembrandt, a number of eleventhcentury Byzantine medallions,and a Gutenberg Bible.9 Hanging in the study was his latest acquisition,Christopher Columbus by Sebastiano del Piombo.10 It was hung next to a paintingof the Commodore’s threehundred-foot-long yacht, which Morgan often preferred asa sleeping quarters to his home when it was docked near Wall Street during theboating season. Tesla eyed the del Piombo in great admiration.“Mrs. Robinson has talked me into donating it to the Metropolitan Museum.Naturally I hate to part with it, but you know how persuasive she can be.”The skittish Tesla had seen Morgan at close range before, but never for longperiods in so intimate a way. Plagued from his youth by a series of skinconditions, Morgan’s beet-red and deformed proboscis, retouched out of allofficial photographs, was often swollen and coated with warts. An art dealer,encountering Morgan in a similar circumstance, was quoted as saying:> I was unprepared for the meeting…I had heard of a disfigurement, but what I> saw upset me so thoroughly that for a moment I could not utter a word. If I> did not gasp I must have changed colour. Mr. Morgan noticed this, and his> small, piercing eyes transfixed me with a malicious stare.

I could not utter a sound, and when> at last I managed to open my mouth I could produce only a raucous cough. He> grunted.11“I want to know, Mr. Tesla,” Morgan began, eyeing one of the inventor’s Coloradophotographs, “how you survived among all of this lightning.”“I didn’t,” Tesla said, avoiding a direct stare. “Those are multiple exposures.”“How clever. White tells me you want to build a wireless tower?”“I have perfected an apparatus which permits the transmission of messages to anydistance without wires, making long and expensive cables as a means of conveyingintelligence commercially obsolete. This creation also enables the productionand manipulation of hundreds of thousands of horsepower, bringing instruments onany point of the globe into action regardless of their distance from thetransmitter.”“Instruments?”“Telegraph keys, phones, clocks, remote photography.”“You have a wireless means for transmitting pictures?” Morgan rebounded, raisinghis eyebrows.“There is nothing novel in telephotography. Edison has been working on it sinceElisha Gray’s device was presented at the 1893 Exposition. My patents simplyusurp the need for using wires.”“Don’t push my tolerance, Mr. Tesla. Your proposal as far as I understand onlydeals with telegraphy. I’m a simple man who wants a way to signal incomingsteamers during times of fog, to send messages to Europe, maybe get Wall Streetprices when I’m in England.12 Can you do this? Can you send wireless messagessuch long distances?”“Indeed I can, Mr. Morgan.”“And the problem of billing? Wouldn’t anyone with a receiver have free access tothis information? I’m not about to subsidize my competitors, or the public forthat matter.”“I can guarantee absolute privacy for all messages. Broad rights have beensecured which gives me a monopoly in the States and most of Europe.”“How ‘broad’ are your costs?”“Although this work concerns a decade of effort, I know that I am in thepresence of a great philanthropist, and therefore do not hesitate to leave theapportionment of my interest and compensation entirely to your generosity.”“Don’t flatter me, Mr. Tesla. Let’s get down to brass tacks. What will it cost?”“My plan requires two transmitting towers, one to transmit across the Atlanticand the other across the Pacific. The former would require an expenditure ofapproximately one hundred thousand dollars, the latter about a quarter of amillion.”“Let’s talk about one ocean at a time. What would I get for funding theconstruction of a wireless plant to cross the Atlantic?”“Its working capacity would equal at least four of the present ocean cables andit would take six to eight months to complete.”13“What about Marconi? Stetson says his costs are one seventh of your quote.”“That is so. However, there are key elements missing for his success, elementswhich can only be found in my patents, in apparatus universally identified withmy name and published in writings dating back to 1890 and 1893, when Marconi wasstill pulling his mother’s apron strings.”“He transmitted fourteen hundred words from ship to shore, right here in NewYork during last year’s America’s Cup races. I know, I was there. I saw hisequipment.”“Mere child’s play. He’s using equipment designed by others, and also the wrongfrequency. The slightest changes in weather will disrupt his messages, and hehas no device for creating separate channels. I have tested his Hertzianfrequencies at length, Mr. Morgan, and believe there is no commercial viabilityin them whatsoever.”“Why exactly are they so wrong?”“For one example, they do not make use of the natural electrical properties ofthe Earth. The Tesla currents on the other hand are tuned to the frequencies ofour planet. These are continuous waves, not pulsed interruptions. In short, myway is best for transmitting substantive information, and insuring totalprivacy.”14“I have a handful of articles with Marconi’s pictures all over them which appearto disagree with you. The British Post Office is using the Hertzianmethod.—Here’s a newspaper report I picked up in England from an Admiral who hasused Marconi’s transmitters for distances exceeding 80 miles: ‘Our [ship]movements have been directed with an ease and certainty and carried out with aconfidence which, without this wonderful extension of the range of signalling,would have been wholly unattainable. It is a veritable triumph for SignorMarconi.”15 And I have articles which question whether you have ever sentmessages beyond the confines of your laboratory.”“I see that I have taken up enough of your time,” the inventor said, looking athis watch. “I thank you very much for your hospitality.”“I’m not saying we can’t do business, Mr. Tesla, but I am going to have to thinkthis over.”“Very good.”Upon Tesla’s departure, Morgan took out a deck of cards and went through hisnightly ritual of playing solitaire. Before him was another file on Tesla’spatents, but these were not in wireless: “Mr. Tesla’s discoveries do away withthe carbon filament…[He] explained that by creating an electrostatic field,[cold vacuum] tubes could be hung anywhere in the room. [They can not burn out,because there is no filament to be destroyed]…The estimated manufacture ofincandescent lamps is 50,000 a day…”16> December 10, 1900> > Dear Mr. Morgan,> > Appreciating the immense value of your time…I have withdrawn more or less> hastily last Friday preferring to make a few condensed statements at long> distance which with a small effort on your part will put you in the possession> of knowledge I have gained only after a long and exhaustive study.This lengthy letter, one of the first of many, began with a quote from ProfessorAdolph Slaby of Germany, who referred to Tesla as “the father of thistelegraphy,” and also included quotes from Lord Kelvin and Sir William Crookeson other developments in the field, such as in the construction of hisoscillator for generating wireless frequencies. The letter also pointed outTesla’s legal position, having patented all of the fundamentals of the process,in America, Australia, South Africa, and Europe, and noted the specific flaws ofMarconi’s system (pointed out above). “Apologizing for this digression…I beg youto bear in mind that my patents in this still virgin field, should you take holdof them…will command a position which, for a number of reasons will be legallystronger than that held by those of my own discovery in power transmission byalternating currents.”Tesla ended the letter with a rousing challenge: “Permit me to remind you thathad there been only faint-hearted and close-fisted people in the world, nothinggreat would ever have been done. Rafael could not have created his marvels,Columbus could not have discovered America, the Atlantic cable could not havebeen laid. You of all should be the man to embark on this enterprise…[which willbe] an act of inestimable value to mankind.”17THE FIRST BILLION-DOLLAR TRUSTPerhaps the most outrageous character living in the Waldorf was thecigarchomping robber baron and stock market manipulator, John W. (Beta-Million)Gates, co-owner of the American Steel & Wire Company. During an average day,Gates could win or lose $40,000 in a poker game, and on some occasions, theswing could be ten times that much. Conferring with Henry Clay Frick, anotherWaldorf occupant and occasional poker companion, Gates helped choreograph one ofthe biggest deals of the century.On December 12, a dinner for the steel magnates was held in honor of CharlesSchwab at the University Club. Sponsored by Schwab’s boss, Andrew Carnegie, theattendees included J. Pierpont Morgan, Edward H. Harriman, August Belmont, JacobSchiff, John W. Gates, and Carnegie’s first manager, Henry Clay Frick.In an unrehearsed speech after the meal, with Carnegie now absent from themeeting, Schwab expounded, in a clear and forthright manner, on the advantagesof creating a giant steel trust.18 After discussions which lasted until three inthe morning, Morgan began to realize the great benefit of Schwab’s plan, andwithin a few months he finalized the merger, placing Schwab at the head of thenew $1.4 billion steel trust, the first company ever to be capitalized at over abillion dollars. Carnegie received approximately $226 million, Frick, $60million, and Rockefeller, for his iron mines, $90 million. Gates, the“gargantuan gambler,” playing it like a poker hand, held out as long aspossible, until Morgan threatened to erect a wire company without him, and sohe, too, walked away with a hefty profit. By March 1901, with the creation ofthe new corporation, Morgan was able to add steel to his portfolio, which atthis time included electrical, shipping, mining and power industries as well astelephone, railroad, and insurance conglomerates.19 Political cartoons of theday portrayed him as an Atlas with the earth on his back or as a Goliathtowering over less powerful individuals, such as the king of England, the GermanKaiser, or the president of the United States.In reaction to “Morganization,” anarchy started to become a viable politicalalternative. Furthermore, although Morgan stood for strength and stability inbusiness, in reality the creation of U.S. Steel was a magnificent gamble.Carnegie knew this and thus stated: “Pierpont is not an ironmaster. He knowsnothing about the business of making and selling steel. I managed my trade withhim so that I was paid…in bonds, not stocks! He will make a fizzle of thebusiness and default in payments of the interest. I will then foreclose and getmy properties back.”20Schwab also feared this. Within two years, the crafty conciliator had resignedfrom the firm to take charge of Bethlehem Steel, a much smaller gem that wassturdy and profitable.Thus, Morgan was to have his headaches with the steel monopoly partly because ofmarket problems and mostly because of labor disputes, particularly a strikewhich nearly crippled the company. Probably the main reason why U.S. Steelsucceeded was because of the invention of the automobile, which created anenormous new market.To offset the possibility of the great conglomerate folding and to raise thepotential for more revenues, Morgan “enlisted” the famous stock manipulatorJames Keene to create an artificial interest. Keene bought and sold large blocksof U.S. Steel to bogus investors in order to create the illusion of bullishinterest.21 The sham worked, and within a few weeks the New York Stock Exchangeexperienced the most active trading days in history. “Big Steel’s common stock,which had been offered on the market at 38, rose almost immediately to 55 andPierpont Morgan became the hero of the financial world and the principal demonof those who feared and hated monopoly.”22THE TESLA DEALTesla met with Morgan in the midst of these steel negotiations in attempts tosolidify a deal. At the height of Christmas season, he took a cab to Morgan’soffice at 23 Wall Street and handed the financier some of his specifications.“Mr. Morgan, my plan, and my patents, which I offer to you, will command aposition legally stronger than that held by the owners of Bell’s telephone or bythe holders of the patents based upon my discovery in power transmission byalternating current.”“Send me the paper work, and I’ll look it over.”“Sir, in view of the intense activity in this field, it is desireable that Ishould be placed without delay in a position enabling us to profit from myadvanced knowledge.”23Morgan moved over to the window and stared down Wall Street. “If I agree to helpbuild your station to transmit across the Atlantic, I want it understood that Iam,”—and then he turned to face the Serb and lowered his voice to barely awhisper—“a silent partner.24 Do you know what that means, Mr. Tesla?”“Yes, sir, I do.”“Good. I want to be frank. I do not have a good impression of you.25 You aboundin controversy, you are boastful, and aside from your deal with Westinghouse,you have yet to show a profit on any other creation. On the other hand, Iappreciate your talents, so let me put my cards on the table. If we proceed,whatever figure we decide upon shall be firm. I will not be bilked forcontinuing research funds.”26“It is not money I seek, although these inventions, in your strong hands, withyour consummate knowledge of business, can be worth an incalculable amount. Youknow the value of scientific advancement and artistic creation. Your terms aremine.”27“That is not good enough. Give me specifics. Give me a figure.”“As I stated at our first meeting, I think a hundred thousand dollars willsuffice for the construction of a ninety-foot-high transatlantic transmitter.”28“Let’s be certain on this. Shall we say one hundred and fifty thousand for theerection of said transmission tower and a fifty-fifty split on the company’sstock?”29 Morgan reached for his checkbook, wrote out a down payment, and handedit to the inventor.Overawed at his good fortune and humbled in the presence of the king, Teslacould not stop himself. “Let the control be yours, Mr. Morgan. I insist that youtake fifty-one percent and I forty-nine.”30“You are a strange man indeed. All right, it’s a deal. After the papers aredrawn up, you may draw on the House of Morgan as the need arises for the fulllimit.”31> January 3, 1901> > My dear Colonel Astor,> > Hearty wishes for the new Century…Mr. Morgan’s generous backing, for which I> shall be grateful all my life, secures me my triumphs in wireless telegraphy> and telephony, but I am still unable to put my completed inventions> [oscillators, fluorescent lights] on the market.

Pierpont Morgan33The octopus was not content with creating a simple partnership in wireless.Unbeknownst to the inventor, Morgan wanted the lighting concern as well andcontrol of Tesla’s patents. Boldly, these were added to the agreement. Tesla wasnow placed in a difficult situation, since Astor was the principal backer in theother enterprise and the inventor had not planned to include the actual patentsas part of his collateral. “When I received your formal letter,” Tesla wrotethree years later, “it specified an interest in fifty-one percent in patents onthese inventions. That was different though my share was the same. It was asimple sale. The terms were entirely immaterial to me and I said nothing, forfear of offending you. You have repeatedly referred to some stock, and it isjust possible, that a mistake was made.”34 Rather than confronting his newbenefactor head-on, Tesla acquiesced.> February 18, 1901> > Dear Mr. Stedleg [Morgan’s intermediary],> > …I need scarcely say that I would sign any document approved by Mr. Morgan,> but believe that there exists a misunderstanding in regards to my system of> lighting which was not included in the original proposition.Rather than try to amend the agreement to remove this vital concern, which, inTesla’s words in the same letter, “will create an industrial revolution,” theinventor pointed out the great advantages of the lighting venture and included apromotional announcement entitled “Tesla’s Artificial Daylight.” He concluded bystating that “besides myself, Col. Astor is interested…[Thus] it will benecessary for me to comply with a formality before making the assignments. Ishall attend to this matter at the earliest possible moment.”35A month before, perhaps in anticipation of this problem, Tesla had appealed onceagain to his original benefactor:> January 11, 1901> > My dear Colonel Astor,> > Since Mr. Adams and his associates are entirely out, I have practically nobody> but you and Mr. Morgan with me…Please let me hear from you…With me you are not> with some wild syndicate, but with a man to whom your name, credit and> interest are sacred.36Astor called on the telephone a week later. He told the inventor that he wasconcerned that Tesla did not have fundamental patents and that other inventorsmight have priority, particularly on the wireless enterprise.“Do not be misled by what the papers say, Colonel, I have the controllingrights. Why not come in with Mr. Morgan and myself.”37Astor avoided making any definitive statements, and so Tesla apparently simplyattached the lighting concern to the wireless deal with the commodore.38 NowMorgan controlled the fundamentals behind two completely independent newindustries. Tesla could hardly complain; he had agreed to the proposal.

Tesla1In March 1900 there was a fire in the East Houston Street building that housedTesla’s laboratory. “The Jews on the lower floor [were] burned out…[and this]frightened me nearly to death,” Tesla wrote the Johnsons. “It was a close shave,and if the misfortune had happened, it would have been probably the last of yourfriend Nikola.”2 Throughout this period the onslaught by the press alsocontinued in an unbridled fashion.> February 25, 1901> > My dear Mr. Tesla,> > We never forget old friends and defend them against all malicious assailants> at all hazards.> > Yours truly,> Earnest HeinrichOne of the old guard from the Westinghouse corporation, Heinreich, included anewspaper clipping which he had written. “Anyone who is ignorant,” Heinreichwrote, “…does not know that Tesla stands in the front rank of electricalinventors by what he has actually accomplished.”3Another who came to Tesla’s defense was T. C. Martin, who authored a word ofpraise in Science. “The ship was off its course,” Tesla wrote, “but I always hadfaith in the captain.”4> December 13, 1900> > My dear Tesla,> > I am delighted to get your kind favor of Dec. 12.

Martin5Unfortunately, there was also bickering between Tesla and Martin about theprevious editorial attacking Tesla in Martin’s journal and about Tesla’s slowprogress on his other inventions. Concerning the vacuum lamps, Martin wrote: “Ishould be delighted to see you or any other man give us the commercial art.”Perturbed, Tesla cut off his correspondence, and so the friendship remainedimpaired.6Just three months later, in March 1901, Tesla invited an admirer and disciple ofSwami Vivekananda, Miss Emma C. Thursby, to his laboratory. “My light will thenbe permanently installed and you and your friends—Miss Farmer in particular—willbe most welcome to see it.”7> Tesla’s New Surprise> > Julian Hawthorne> > Great preparations for an experiment upon a stupendous scale are being made at> the wizard’s laboratory on East Houston Street…An unannounced visitor gained> entrance today by chance.

The son,however, easily surpassed the father, as he was able to maintain five or sixretreats, including an estate on Long Island, an apartment in Gramercy Park, theGarden Tower suite, “the Morgue” on West Fifty-fifth Street, which he and hiscompatriots, like Saint-Gaudens, “used in a pinch,” and his “most infamoushaunt,” at 22 West Twenty-fourth St.11In March, Stanford became smitten by the exotic charms of the sixteen-year-oldFloradora siren, Evelyn Nesbit, who had been featured as a Gibson centerfold forColliers and as a nearly bare-breasted Spanish dancer in a popular musical onBroadway. White watched her perform night after night for many weeks before hewas able to arrange a rendezvous, which first took place in the heat of thesummer at the Twenty-fourth Street studio.12“Stanford had me put in an electric door,” the inventor told Hawthorne. “Youpress a button, and it automatically opens.”White had decorated his bachelor den in shades of red, with velvet curtains onthe windows, soft cushions on the floor, and tapestries, statues, and paintings,mostly nudes all around. In his loft, with the room set like a small forest, litwith a bright skylight, could be found a red velvet swing hanging from theceiling, like one of Chaucer’s toys, with green ropes trailing down from theseat, like vines from a tree.13Besides meeting with the mystical son of the renowned Gothic author, NathanielHawthorne, Tesla dined with Stanford White and sometimes Mark Twain at thePlayers’ Club, or with Spanish-American War hero, Richmond Hobson, RudyardKipling, or, of course, the Johnsons throughout this period. Katharine wascaught up in her interest in spiritualism and tried an experiment in thoughttransference without the inventor knowing. In jest, Tesla wrote back:> My dear Mrs. Johnson,> > There was no telepathic influence this time. I never thought of you even for a> moment.> > Sincerely,> Millionaire Kid!14Rooted in his materialistic philosophy, the superstitious “wizard who talks withother worlds”15 continued to repudiate the notion that human minds couldinteract by extrasensory means, even though he had recently saved some friendsfrom a train wreck because of a premonition.16 Overtly, however, he wouldmaintain that psychic phenomena was poppycock. Katharine would not only beteased for her mystical bent but also over possession of Hobson and over herlooks.> My dear Luka,> > When Mrs. Filipov is out of town I think of Mrs. de Kay as the most charming> lady of my experience. It would be advisable, Luka, to keep both ladies in> ignorance of this. A word to the wise is sufficient.17Considered much like an uncle to the family, Tesla also expressed his continuingaffection for the Johnson children. For Agnes, he would sign a New Year’s card“Nikola Hobson,” and for Owen, he took the time to read the youngster’s firstnovel, The Arrow of the Almighty. He also congratulated Owen on his impendingmarriage. Agnes would also later marry, and she would inherit the vast Johnsoncorrespondence, much of which was donated to Columbia University. According tothe present Mrs. Robert Underwood Johnson, the wife of Owen’s son (named afterthe grandfather), Agnes was “awful. I didn’t like her at all. Her daughter,however, was very beautiful. Paderewski felt that Ann had great talent…Owen wasvery dashing and attractive, and had a lot of his mother’s qualities. As awriter, he authored the Lawrenceville series and made a good living as anovelist.”The present Mrs. Johnson stated that Katharine had “an Irish personality.” Shecould be “gay and lively and fun loving, but also depressive underneath.” Thepresent Robert Underwood Johnson lived with his grandparents. “They had twoIrish servants, Josie and Norah. Katharine would go into one of her moods, andjust stay in her room and wouldn’t come down even for meals. Her depressionbecame more severe…after World War I.” She said that Robert was considered to be“boring, very formal with old world manners…a fine old gentleman. Katharine wasattracted to Tesla because he was imaginative and exciting from a European pointof view. He might have brought more gaiety into the house.”18> WARDENCLYFFE> > “Inventor Nikola Tesla has purchased a 200-acre tract at Wardenclyffe on the> Sound, nine miles east of Port Jefferson for the establishment of a wireless> telegraphy plant. The land and improvements will cost $150,000.”19On March 1, 1901, Tesla officially signed his contract with Morgan. He was nowable to begin construction of his laboratory and tower on Long Island,sixty-five miles from New York City. Two days later, Morgan officially announcedthe creation of U.S. Steel. No such announcement was made about the TeslaCompany. The above article, which appeared in a local paper, the Long IslandDemocrat, was perhaps the only one to make reference to the correct figure of$150,000, which Morgan provided. When John O’Neill wrote his biography in 1944,he did not know the details of the Morgan-Tesla relationship, even though he hadpersonally known Tesla for over thirty years. The inventor, whose papers werestill under lock and key at the time of the completion of the biography, hadtold O’Neill that the financier provided the funds in his capacity as aphilanthropist, although this was not the case at all. It was a simple businesspartnership.Tesla celebrated the new connection by giving a large party at theWaldorf-Astoria. He had discussed with Oscar the details of the menu andparticipated in tasting the various sauces. Impeccably dressed, he reserved oneof the smaller banquet halls, requesting his guests to arrive at seventhirtysharp. White was probably there, along with the Johnsons, Hobson, and perhapsMiss Merrington or Vivekananda acolytes Miss Thursby or Miss Farmer or AnneMorgan. As legend tells it, when it came time for dinner to be served, themaître d’ was forced to call Tesla aside to inform him that he owed the hotelback bills totaling more than $900. He was under orders. Dinner could not beserved unless the matter was straightened out first. With an ace up his sleeve,Tesla nonchalantly welcomed his guests and then eased out to see the manager.Mr. Boldt was cordial but insistent, so Tesla made a call and put him on thephone with Morgan. Flustered, Boldt was nevertheless able to hold his ground. Acheck was sent immediately, and the inventor was saved from embarrassment.20Soon after, Tesla met with real estate mogul Charles R. Flint, who arranged ameeting with James Warden, director of the North Shore Industrial Company.Warden, who was in control of an eighteen-hundredacre potato farm on Long IslandSound, in Suffolk County, provided Tesla with two hundred acres adjacent to whatis today called Route 25A. The inventor was also given the option to purchasethe remaining parcel. Perhaps to sweeten the deal or in lieu of certain otherarrangements, the cite was named Wardenclyffe, after the owner, and a postoffice under that appellation was established on April 2. Five years later, in1906, the name was officially changed to the Village of Shoreham.21Electrical World & Engineer reported: “The company is offering its stock forsale at $100 per share, expecting to pay 15 per cent dividends…The WardenclyffeBuilding Company shall have the first rightand privilege to do all building and make all constructional improvements…andshall have the first right of purchase of any additional land offered by it forsale.” Warden, who was interviewed for the article, predicted that “largeprofits will be realized in the future.” Describing Tesla as “the foremostelectrician of the age, whose achievements in electrical science eclipse inpractical importance all other discoveries of the century,” Warden noted thatthe inventor “has just closed a contract to expend…a very large sum of money inconstructing electrical laboratories and the main station for his wirelesstelegraphy system of communication with Europe and Australasia. This developmentwill require a large number of houses for the accommodation of the severalhundreds of people whom Mr. Tesla will employ.”22Tesla’s ultimate plan was to construct a “World Telegraphy Center,” with alaboratory, wireless transmitter, and production facilities for manufacturinghis oscillators and vacuum tubes. He had negotiated with Morgan the first step,that is, to build the laboratory and a simple tower for reporting yacht races,signaling ocean steamers, and sending Morse-coded messages to England.Simultaneously, he discussed with McKim, Mead & White the construction of anentire metropolis, “a model city,” using the eighteen-hundred acres available,with homes, stores, and buildings to house upwards of twenty-five hundredworkers.23 “Wardenclyffe will be the largest operation of its kind in theworld,” Tesla told the local newspapers. “The laboratory will draw men from thehighest scientific circles and their presence will benefit all of Long Island…24With a staff of 75 draftsmen, the eminent architectural firm of McKim, Mead andWhite is well suited to the task,” Tesla concluded. They billed him $1,168 forblueprints.25White, it appears, was placed in a precarious position: Morgan still hadreservations about his connection with the flamboyant engineer. In his capacityas interior decorator, White, in February, had located a statue in London whichhe knew the financier was interested in. “My dear Commodore,” the engagingredhead wrote, “it is really like parting with a pieceof my heart to give it up…[Thus] I would honestly rather [present it toyou, than sell it]…as my only desire…is to please you.” But Morgan insisted oncompensating him for the statue, paying White “double the normal commission” inorder to show that he, too, felt their affiliation transcended “business.”26> April 26, 1901> > Dear Nikola,> > I send you with this a new revised plan for your power house, also a very> close estimate which we have made ourselves in this office…The work could be> done for about $14,000.

In May blueprints for the laboratory were sent over toTesla for his approval, in June a contract with Sturgis and Hill wasfinalized,28 and in July the land was cleared, and a road was put in.29 Whiterecommended one of his associates, W. D. Crow, as architect in charge. Crowwould also do the actual construction of the tower.30The sun was out bright one morning in the early spring as the inventor strutteddown Peacock Alley and up Fifth Avenue toward Forty-second Street and GrandCentral Station, to transfer to Pennsylvania Station and take an early train toWardenclyffe. Golden shafts of light billowed through the upper windows of thecathedral-like edifice as Tesla crossed the mighty corridor and stepped aboardthe luxury car. Ordering a pot of coffee, he began to peruse his mail. The trainrattled out of the city, past Manhassett, Oyster Bay, where Vice PresidentRoosevelt lived, St. James near Smithtown, where White had his family estate,Port Jefferson, and finally to Wardenclyffe. With stops at the various towns,the trip took about an hour and a half, the Connecticut shoreline sometimesvisible across the Sound.

Unlikethe inventor, whose ideas existed in abstract and futuristic forms, thepragmatic financier’s mind was on the present. Morgan loved sailing and yachtraces and would resent another suggesting what a man in his position should orshould not do.Tesla reveals in this letter that he had to change his plans due to the“advantage shrewd competitors had” (e.g., due to Marconi’s pirating andconnections with Pupin, Edison, European investors, and sovereign rulers). Hethereupon decided to abandon the agreed-upon scheme of building a modest-sizedtransmitter and replaced it with the idea of constructing a skyscraping towersix hundred feet high, designs for which he scratched out on his fancyWaldorf-Astoria stationery.33 Ironically, for the ofttimes altruistic Tesla, itwas his greed, vanity, and megalomania which drove him into the new venture. Tohave his ideas stolen from him was abhorrent. In his autobiography, Tesla wouldlater refer to Marconi (although not by name) as a “parasite and microbe of anasty disease.” It was at this moment that the inventor decided to scrap thetrivial idea of sending mere Morse codes across the Atlantic. He wouldinaugurate a world communications enterprise to pulverize the vermin as apachyderm would crush a toad.Having reached the pinnacle of the ruling class, Tesla’s self-image swelled withthe occasion, for he had conceived a telecommunications enterprise moreefficient than the combined forces of today’s radio, television, wire service,lighting, telephone, and power systems! His ultimate plan even included theproduction of rain in the deserts, the lighting of skies above shipping lanes,the wireless production of energy for automobiles and airships, a universaltime-keeping apparatus, and a mechanism for achieving interplanetarycommunication. Having attained cosmic consciousness, he offered this creation tothe king of the financial world, and the king had accepted. To the inventor, itwas simply a detail that this vision was not in agreement with the specifics ofthe contract or that Tesla never really told Morgan his greater scheme; thiswork, like White’s statue, transcended the traditional rules of business.PANIC ON WALL STREETIt was just sixty days since Tesla had signed his contract with Morgan, thirtydays after Morgan sailed for Europe. Yet already Tesla had irreversibly changedhis plans. Since he had been a gambler and pool player in his salad days and wasnow living among the most audacious of high rollers at the Waldorf, these oldtendencies resurfaced now that he had “hooked the biggest fish on Wall Street.”He had calculated the odds based on certain assumptions about the stability ofthe economy and the quickness of his access to Morgan’s $150,000, and heproceeded boldly with the completion of the masterwork.How could the inventor know that on May 10 the stock market would crash and thatthe main culprit in the catastrophe would be his backer, J. Pierpont Morgan?The collapse of the stock market occurred because of a bitter rivalry thatexisted between Morgan and Ned Harriman. Morgan, who was in charge of theNorthern Pacific Railroad, having tossed Henry Villard out a decade earlier, hadbought control of an enormous line called the Chicago Burlington. This concernstretched its tracks from Atlantic ports to Chicago and down the Mississippi allthe way to New Orleans. Harriman, who controlled the Union Pacific, or southernroute to the west, wanted access to the Burlington as well, and he tried tonegotiate with Morgan for a seat on the board of directors. Unfortunately, dueto bitter disagreements stemming from an old railroad deal in which the craftyHarriman had outwitted the commodore, Morgan came to detest the man. Therefore,he would not share the Burlington and became irrational whenever Harriman’s namewas mentioned.34Thus, while Morgan enjoyed his art purchases in England and his mistress inFrance, Harriman, with the help of his broker, Jacob Schiff, clandestinely beganpurchasing Morgan’s Northern Pacific. Instead of trying to outbid Morgan for theBurlington, Harriman boldly bought Morgan’s own holding company out fromunderneath him! To accomplish this coup(!), it would take the adventuresomeHarriman close to $100 million, which he raised by selling enormous blocks ofUnion Pacific bonds, and Harriman actually successfully carried out theoperation. By the first week in May, Harriman owned more than 50 percent ofMorgan’s precious company, which had been affectionately called the Nipper. WhenMorgan received the fateful telegram from his underlings while in France, hetossed his paramour off his lap and wired back the order to buy Northern Pacificback at any price, for Harriman did not yet own a majority of the voting commonshares.On May 9, the stock rocketed from $150 to $1,000 per share! A panic ensued aspeople who bought in on the Nipper were unable to obtain possession of theirshares, as neither Morgan nor Harriman would release any; most of the otherstocks dropped when investors sold in order to cover their losses. The endproduct was the tumbling of the market and the creation of extreme economic andpolitical times and also monetary chaos. Stanford White was one of many who lostheavily in the market. For Tesla, costs increased dramatically, and credit wasnearly impossible to obtain. The front page of the New York Times reported thecalamity: “The greatest general panic that Wall Street has ever known came uponthe stock market yesterday, with the result that before it was checked manyfortunes had been swept away…”35Even Morgan’s precious U.S. Steel dropped from its current price of forty-six toa low of eight dollars a share.36 Numerous investors were financially ruined,and some purportedly committed suicide. (One rumor concerning this famous eventwas that Morgan won back the company because Harriman’s broker, Jacob Schiff,was in the synagogue on the fateful Saturday when Morgan began buying moreshares of Northern Pacific. Schiff, however, never intended to wrest the companyfrom Morgan. His goal was simply to obtain a large enough percentage of thecompany to force Morgan to give Harriman a piece of the Chicago Burlington.Harriman, in his frenzy, wanted to change their plan so as to gain control overall three railroads, but Schiff overruled him. Thus, the skyrocketing of thestock and ensuing crash of the market were based solely on Morgan’s buy orders.)The economic upheaval created heavy financial burdens on Tesla. However, hewould not completely realize the increasing financial difficulties immediately,for the affects on construction costs, wages, and incidentals would ripplethroughout the summer and fall.Before Pierpont’s departure for England, in April, he had assured Tesla that nowhe “had no doubts” about the inventor’s abilities,37 and even if, by some flukeof misfortune, Morgan should not supply additional funds, Tesla still had hisown money and the personality to attract additional investors. At forty-fiveyears of age, wealthy, established as a leader of his field (howevercontroversial), and rubbing elbows with the crème de la crème, the tall inventorwas well equipped for the task he foresaw."},{"pageContent":"31CLASH OF THE TITANS (1901) [002-toc.html#ch31]> Make a Tesla or buy a Tesla coil. I made one, find it…Get books on wireless> telegraphy.> > FROM THE PRIVATE NOTEBOOK OF THOMAS EDISON1Throughout the late spring and summer, Tesla commuted regularly to Wardenclyffe,often with a servant of Serbian extraction and a box lunch from theWaldorf-Astoria.2 At night he returned to the city, where he could stop in atthe Players’ Club, attend a concert, or dine at Delmonico’s or Sherry’s. InJune, having to forgo yet another “Johnson blowout,” he apologized to Robert andOwen for being “unable to meet the lady who inspired the celebrated author ofthe Arrows of the Almighty.”3White was on his yearly fishing vacation in Canada,4 so Tesla was on his own forthe month. Some of the time was spent scouting out possible apartments to rentin Shoreham, and George Scherff also had to look for a place. In July thearchitect returned, and talks resumed concerning the construction of the tower.Having recently joined the Automobile Club of America, which had itsheadquarters in Locust Valley and counted Vice President Teddy Roosevelt amongits members,5 White would motor out from the city to the club or to St. James inhis new “steam-powered Locomobile,” which required a driver, or on his own in afashionable “electric two-seater runabout.”6 With his estate just a few milesfrom Shoreham, the avid motorist could drive out past the endless flats ofpotato fields, along the same road that also led to the site of Wardenclyffe tooversee the work and perhaps take the inventor for a spin. The architect’s sonrecalled: “I remember Tesla well, as he often came down to stay with us on LongIsland. He used to wander around at night in the garden in the moonlight; andwhen my mother asked him why he wasn’t asleep, he replied: ‘I never sleep.’ Ialso remember going to his laboratory [in the city] as a boy, and watching himput several million volts through his body lighting up two Crookes tubes whichhe held in his hand.”7White made Tesla realize that a six-hundred-foot-high transmitter (roughlytwo-thirds the height of the Eiffel Tower) was simply out of the question, soTesla dabbled with harmonic ratios of one-half and one-quarter that size. Withprices so unstable, it would be difficult to calculate the new costs.The Johnsons were as excited as Tesla about the purchase of Wardenclyffe. ByJuly, with the land cleared, it became an opportune moment to visit thesite—just a few miles from a lovely beach on the Sound at Wading River and alsonot far from Southampton on the Atlantic side. A weekend was set aside to coaxTesla into spending some time swimming. It was a delightful moment, a time toenjoy the salt water and picnic grounds and pose for whimsical photographs oftheir heads placed in the notches of standard billboard pictures of bodies instriped bathing suits or, gaily adorned, sitting in the seats of an imitationautomobile.8In August, with the frame up on the lab and plans for the facing under way,Tesla once again refused a respite in Maine with the Johnsons, writing a teasingletter that as a member of the Four Hundred he could not meet with “people whosefathers have been fruit peddlers and grocers.”9 Perhaps Katharine’s father hadbeen such.10 With the tower now planned as a much larger venture and Morgandelaying payment of promised funds, Tesla pondered a way not only to obtain owedfunds but also to get Morgan to increase his investment.The monarch with the bulbous snout returned from Europe on the Fourth of July.Leaving the ocean liner from the stern in order to avoid the throng ofreporters, Morgan ignored his home and moved to the Corsair, his 300-foot-longyacht, living there for the month and staying in Bar Harbor, Maine, through partof August.11 The art connoisseur was pleased with his recent acquisitions ofpaintings, gemstones, and rare manuscripts—he did not shorten his yearlyEuropean excursion on account of a Wall Street crisis—but he was irritable,irrationally perturbed with Harriman, and fearful that the press and publicmight threaten his empire, if not his life. Morgan was an opinionated man,fair-minded much of the time but dangerously stubborn at other times. Havingdetested Harriman for outwitting him not once but twice, he must have beenfurious when the world viewed him as the villain who had destabilized theeconomy because of a personal vendetta. A turbulent labor strike by the steelworkers added to his unhappiness and the uncertainty of the times. Headlinessuch as the following caused him to seek armed protection:> THE RICH DENOUNCED BY SOCIALIST LABOR> > Thousands at Cooper Union> > Cheer Wordy Assaults on Capital.> > J. P. Morgan Accused of Trying to “Trustify the Earth.”> > “This is the century,” said chairman Lucien Sanial, “in which there is going> to be social revolution.”> > Whoop went the audience waving hats and yelling madly for a minute or> so…Charles Knoll [followed and] said he favored the adoption of such> resolutions as would “chill and make to shiver the spinal column of the> capitalists.”12To end the Northern Pacific fiasco, Morgan and Harriman allowed investors tosettle their accounts at $150 a share. The public was not supposed to noticethat this price would yield hefty profits to the giants who had purchased theirstock for one-third less than that price only days earlier. Instead, they wereperceived as noble in their attempts to restore order and sanity to the economy.At first, the government wanted Morgan to return stocks to the originalinvestors at original prices. In response, Morgan was quoted as saying that itwould be quite a feat to “unscramble the eggs and return them to their originalhens!” When accused of avoiding his responsibility to society, Morgan respondedin anger, “I owe the public nothing.” For this remark, Morgan would beinterrogated by the governmental investigative committees until his dying days,but he weathered the storm easily.Before Morgan left for Maine, he met with the inventor. In a new satchelpurchased for the occasion, Tesla brought his latest patent applications,drawings of the half-completed laboratory, and schematics for the tower. Thesecretary at 23 Wall Street ushered him in.“Mr. Morgan, you have raised great waves in the industrial world and some havestruck my little boat. Prices have gone up in consequence, twice, perhaps threetimes higher than they were and then there were expensive delays, mostly as aresult of activities you excited.”13“We’ve all suffered, Mr. Tesla,” Morgan said, already perturbed and testybecause of the more important imbroglios he was enmeshed in.Tesla pushed on, informing Morgan that he had decided to design a larger towerthan agreed upon because of Marconi’s piracy. Morgan looked on, at first indetached amazement, as Tesla continued.“Suppose a plant is constructed capable of sending signals within a givenradius, and consider an extension to twice the distance. The area being thenfour times as large, the returns will become more valuable. Approximatelycomputed, the average price will be tripled. This means that a plant, with aradius of activity twice as large, will earn twelve times as much. But it willcost twice as much…The greater the distance the greater the gain until, when theplant can transmit signals to the uttermost confines of the Earth, its earningpower becomes, so to speak, unlimited.“The way to go, [Mr. Morgan, is] to construct such a plant…It [will] give thegreatest force to my patents and ensure a monopoly…[and] offer[s] possibilitiesfor business on a large, dignified scale commensurate with your position in lifeand mine as a pioneer in this art, who has originated all essentialprinciples.”14“Let me understand you, Mr. Tesla. You have not exploited the lightingenterprise?”“Not yet, sir.”“You have not constructed a transmitting tower, but you have just aboutcompleted the construction of a laboratory?”“Yes.”“You have purchased, is this 200 acres? with an option on 1,600 more, and youhave run out of funds?”“Only temporarily, sir. Once you supply the balance…”“And if I relinquish these funds, will that be enough for the creation of your‘model city’?”“No, as I explained…”“If we double the size of the tower, I will earn twelve times as much. Is thatit?”“Precisely.”“Get out, Mr. Tesla.”“But, sir…,”Raising his voice to a dull roar, Morgan reiterated his command. Quietly, Teslapacked his satchel and slipped away.The inventor was in shock. One can only imagine which favored swear wordsMorgan, known “on Wall Street…for his gruffness and blunt expletives,”15unfurled upon the prima donna who had pranced into his office with his fantasticscheme and high and mighty demands. Tesla required a few days to regain hiscomposure. Morgan still legitimately owed him a significant amount of funds. Thebanker was upset, with the problems, with the Northern Pacific, and with theensuing denigration by the press. It will pass, Tesla reasoned. The best thingto do would be to reestablish credibility. He forwarded Morgan his most recentpatent assignments and then backed off.16The following week, White telephoned to suggest that they go with a rough stonefacing on the laboratory instead of brick, and the inventor agreed. “Please makesure they also put in a fireproof roof,” Tesla told his architect.17“Let’s not rush the tower,” White cautioned. “I’m still calculating figures foryou.”As White was courting during these very weeks on a daily basis Evelyn Nesbit andalso helping Tesla recalibrate the construction of the complex, it is possiblethat the tight-lipped inventor became privy to the architect’s intimateliaison.18In a financial predicament, Tesla reported to White that he had visited the“American Bridge people to ascertain whether they will be able to construct thecupola of my [tower] without much delay. As this item will consume the longesttime, it is necessary to take all the preliminary steps, so that the work may bebegun just as soon as you have passed upon the plans.“I believe that the American Bridge Company is the best concern to deal with inthis matter,” Tesla continued, “but I beg you not to pay any attention to mysuggestion, if you think otherwise. The Bethlehem Steel Company will furnish thesheets, but I cannot give the order until we have agreed upon all details.”19“You must enjoy parting with your money, if you are negotiating with AmericanBridge,” White responded. “I implore you to let me handle the contracts. Ishould have the figures in a few weeks, but I can tell you right now, a 300 foottower is out of the question so we do not know what size the cupola will be…Youmust also consider the extra cost for designing the tower so that eachindividual strut can be replaced if need be, without toppling the entireedifice.”“[Please understand, Stanford,] I went to the American Bridge Company simplybecause of my anxiety to have the work pushed through as fast as practicable. Iam only too glad to follow your advice, and beg you to consider yourselfabsolutely free in your choice and arrangements regarding this work.”20On Friday, September 6, 1901, President William McKinley journeyed to Buffalo toattend an exposition and see firsthand the remarkable project instituted atNiagara. Dwarfed by the colossal Tesla turbines, the president wove his way backto the train station shaking hands with many of the onlookers. While waiting onthe platform, a crazed anarchist lurched forward and fired at point-blank range.As McKinley struggled throughout the week at the edge of death, Tesla decided towrite to the president’s old-time friend Morgan, sending the appeal on theinventor’s favorite day, Friday the thirteenth, the day the president died.“McKinley’s passing,” Morgan cried, “is the saddest news I have ever heard.”21Beginning the letter with “I respectfully apologize for disturbing you at a timewhen your mind must be filled with thoughts of a more serious nature thanusual,” the inventor imprudently reiterated his recent proposal, suggesting thatif Morgan doubled his investment, Tesla would be able to send messages acrossthe Pacific as well as the Atlantic, or better yet, if Morgan tripled theamount, the wizard could send messages to any point on the globe, “no matterwhat the distance.”22 On the same day, he also wrote to White, who had finallygiven him precise figures on his proposed monster-sized tower.> My dear Stanford,> > I have not been half as dumbfounded by the news of the shooting of the> President as I have by the estimates submitted to you, which, together with> your kind letter of yesterday, I received last night. One thing is clear we> cannot build that tower as outlined.> > I cannot tell you how sorry I am, for my calculations show, that with such a> structure, I could reach across the Pacific.Tesla told White that because of the limitations on capital, he would have to“fall back on an older design…involving the use of two, and possibly threetowers, but much smaller.” The design would be the same, only the dimensionswould be reduced. “I shall make some calculations,” the inventor concluded, “tosee how far I can reduce the height without impairing materially the efficiencyof the apparatus, and will communicate with you as soon as practicable.”23The following day, Tesla wrote White again, agreeing to construct a tower with aheight of approximately 150 feet.24 Having worked with figures on a tower 600feet high in May, Tesla probably reduced it by half by the time he saw Morgan inAugust, and then in half again after White told him that the costs of a 300-foottower were prohibitive. Adding the figure of “1/6th larger,” which he mentionedto White in his last letter (or 25 feet), we come to 150 + 25, or 175 feet,which was just about the height of the actual tower. (After construction, it was187 feet.) However, Tesla also constructed a well beneath the tower, with anaccompanying spiral staircase, which ran ten stories below the ground, to adepth of 120 feet.25 Adding this figure to the total (i.e., 187 + 120), we cometo a length of approximately 300 feet, or 1/2 the size of the original plan andtherefore in a harmonic relationship to it. Even this tower, however, was tooexpensive to build, given the cost of the machinery, complex design of thehousing, which required that it be fireproof, and the inflation produced by thecrash.In pondering these letters, it becomes apparent that Tesla was not too perturbedby the assassination of the president. Self-engulfed, he was utterly amblyopicwhen it came to negotiating with Morgan, a man enmeshed in two potentially epiccrises and one history-altering tragedy. Theodore Roosevelt, who now becamepresident, was not a man who was going to be particularly kind to big business.To say that Tesla blundered here would be an understatement. His decision toalter his contract without telling Morgan and his resolution to proceed with thegrand vision when he knew that his funds would be inadequate were addlebrained.One suspects that once Tesla had signed a contract with the greatest financialforce on the planet, a deep-seated, subconscious complex was triggered involvingan impatient egomaniacal streak that forced the inventor to place everything onthe line when he should have proceeded in a more discerning way. Incapable ofcompromising and at the risk of self-obliteration, Tesla began construction ofthe tower after his falling out with Morgan. On the positive side, the inventorknew that he was in a race against pirates and for what he perceived as the“Holy Grail,” his peerless notch in history. Undaunted, the courageous inventormoved ahead with the conviction that his path was right and that he could notfail.Tesla’s seemingly foolhardy decision must be understood in light of the factthat fortunes had already been reaped on his former inventions by Morgan andothers. By 1901, for instance, Morgan’s General Electric Company was actuallyproducing more induction motors than the Westinghouse Corporation; Morgan wasinvolved, along with Westinghouse, in instituting an electric subway system inthe bowels of Manhattan based on Tesla’s polyphase system; and then, of course,there was Niagara Falls. Every home in the world was going to be illuminated byTesla’s system. The revenues pouring into the electric power companies for thisnew technology were staggering, but Tesla received not a cent. One way oranother, he felt that Morgan should give him carte blanche.It was a bleak autumn for the inventor when the ground was broken for theeighteen-story edifice, Tesla now naming it his “magnifying transmitter.”Although mostly constructed of wood, “50 tons of iron and steel” were also used,along with “50,000 bolts.”26 Taking into account the amount of lumber it took toline the well and build the staircase down, and the difficulty in digging it,one begins to visualize the enormous expenditures that were going to beinvolved. W. D. Crow stayed in charge of construction. Hoping for the best,Tesla wrote to Katharine on October 13:> My dear Mrs. Johnson,> > 13 is my lucky number and so I know you will comply with my wish…[to] come to> the Waldorf.

Tesla28Morgan’s continuing mistreatment of the inventor and lack of acknowledgment ofthe significance of the plans revealed were almost too much to bear. Tesla couldnot face the Johnsons or anybody for Thanksgiving and so declined theirinvitation. “Dear Luka,” Tesla wrote, “Kindly excuse and remember me with kindregards,” signing the letter, “Nikola Faraway.”29NEWFOUNDLANDSignor Marconi had been commuting regularly between England and the Statesthroughout this period, looking for sites to place his wireless stations. Primelocations included the eastern tip of Long Island, Martha’s Vineyard, and CapeCod. “In September 1901, the new equipment, including the immensely powerfultransmitter, was installed at Poldhu [England] and a great 200-foot diameterring of masts 200-feet high had risen like [a huge] skeleton…on the edge of thecliff. Test transmissions to other Marconi stations, in particular that atCrookhaven, Ireland, over two hundred miles away, had shown that the wavesdid—at least to this extent—follow the curvature of the Earth and not fly offinto space. Across the Atlantic, at Cape Cod, the twin station was similarlynearing completion, and plans were made with quiet optimism for the experimentto take place in a few weeks’ time.”30In September, gale-force winds leveled the aerial in Poldu, and in November thesame thing occurred on the Cape. Tenaciously, Marconi pressed on, gambling witha less powerful but sturdier transmitter in England and abandoning the idea ofconstructing a twin in the States. Instead, the Italian would try simply tointercept the signals of the English transmitter by fashioning an aerial withkites, high-altitude weather balloons, and a sensitive coherer as a receiver.On December 6, he landed, with a small crew, in Newfoundland, Canada, andfloated up his receiving antenna on a spot designated appropriately as SignalHill. December 12 was chosen as the day for the experiment, the beacon selecteddot dot dot, the Morse code for the letter S.On Friday the thirteenth, during a lull in a miserable storm of hail and rain,three faint taps were heard on his equipment. The world was rocked; GuglielmoMarconi’s name was irrefutably carved into the history books; the age of masscommunication had begun."},{"pageContent":"32THE PASSING OF THE TORCH (1902) [002-toc.html#ch32]> December 1901: Signor Marconi has scored a shrewd coup.

Preece assumed partial culpability, as he had requested fromTesla the use of this equipment for the work, but Marconi had announced that theTesla apparatus was unnecessary and ineffectual,2 and this had caused a rift inthe Italian’s relationship with Preece. Fleming, on the other hand, havingstudied Tesla’s work in earnest ever since he had received the inventor at hishome in London in 1892, saw no such conflict; for it was he who “arranged forMarconi the transmitting plant at Poldhu.”3 Tesla revealed many years later:“[Marconi had] declared that wireless communication across the Atlantic wasimpossible because there was a wall of water several miles high between the twocontinents which the rays could not traverse. But subsequent developments showedthat he had used my system in secret all the time, received the plaudits of theworld and accepted stolidly even my own congratulations, and it was only a longtime after that he admitted it.”4Thomas Commerford Martin arrived at his office on Monday, December 16 to reviewthe astonishing report from Newfoundland. With only Marconi and one aide as awitness and the plans having been kept secret until the deed was accomplished,many doubted the Italian’s proclamation. Prof. Silvanus Thomson, of GreatBritain, suggested that Marconi had probably received static caused by severeweather conditions. One of Martin’s colleagues concurred: “It’s a fake. Such athing cannot be done.”“I think I should seek another opinion,” the editor said as he put in a call toTom Edison.“Very doubtful. How’s it going to get around that blasted curve?” came Edison’shedging response. Martin dialed up Michael Pupin.“Professor, do you believe Marconi’s transmission is genuine?”“I most certainly do.”“Then I think we ought to celebrate it.”5It was the dead of winter when Tesla ducked out of the Waldorf-Astoria as thenew crowning electrical savant checked in. Tesla probably went to Wardenclyffeto stare at the first tier of the tower, which was finally under construction.With the temperature so cold, it was just one more annoyance to slow downprogress.With only a few days to prepare, Martin was able to book the Astor Gallery atthe Waldorf for the banquet, on Monday, January 13, 1902. With three hundredguests arriving, the task of arranging all the particulars put him in a frenziedstate. He brushed by fantastic pictures of a wizard’s laboratory as he hurriedout the door.The hall was decorated with a large map of the Atlantic placed on the wall and afestoon of wires “with clusters of three lights” blinking dot-dot-dot strungbetween large tablets reading Signal Hill in Newfoundland and Poldhu in England.Around the room, each table had its own model transmission tower, nameplates,and “Italian olive green menus” on card stock with pen and ink drawings of thetransatlantic accomplishment. At the upper dais “in the middle was a medallionwith Mr. Marconi’s portrait, draped with the Italian flag.” American and Britishflags and pendants for the AIEE and the Italian coat of arms were also placedthere.“At fitting times, [the lights] were flashed” to the applause of the audience;and to cap off the dinner, for dessert, a “procession of waiters” came marchingin with ice cream imbedded in ice carvings of incandescent lamps, ships at sea,electric vehicles, and wireless telegraph towers.6The four-foot gnome trimmed his goatee and checked his gold pocket watch beforesmiling at himself once more in the mirror as he departed for the affair.Although he rocked from side to side when he walked, Charles Proteus Steinmetzdeveloped a new swagger, for he had just been elected to the presidency of theAIEE. He was about to receive an honorary doctorate from Harvard and aprofessorship in engineering from Union College, located near GE headquarters inSchenectady, New York. The college appointment enabled Steinmetz to divide histime between academia and the corporate world.During the six-hour train ride down to the city, the abstract mathematicancarefully read through galleys of his opus on AC which was about to berepublished in a larger format by McGraw-Hill. It was a small matter to thepreeminent scholar that he had removed the name of his coauthor and hadcontinued the practice of eliminating reference to the source of his work, TheInventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla. Electricians, herationalized, would be more interested in his advanced concepts than “in knowingwho first investigated the phenomena.”7 By 1907, Steinmetz would lead inestablishing the AIEE Code of Ethics.8 Who was Tesla, anyway? Marconi was theman of the hour.At the upper dais sat a gaggle of Tesla adversaries. Aside from the newpresident, there was Professor Pupin, now financially tied to Marconi; ElihuThomson, who claimed priority on the invention of the AC motor and Tesla coil;Carl Hering, who had backed Dobrowolski in priority discussions of the inventorof long-distance AC transmission; William Stanley, who had pirated theTesla/Westinghouse induction motor and was now producing them legally for GE;Frank Sprague, who gained his reputation in part as the inventor of the electricrailroad when, in fact, it was all part of Tesla’s AC polyphase system; T. C.Martin, who was still angry about past moneys owed for sale of the inventor’scollected works; and, of course, Guglielmo Marconi, the chap who had beaten himto the punch. Tesla’s decision not to attend created an excellent atmosphere forgaiety—and for perpetuating Steinmetz’s published position of relegating thepioneer to the category of nonperson.Others present at the infamous upper dais included Alexander Graham Bell andgeneral counsels from Great Britain and Italy, and around the hall were JoshWetzler, D. McFarlan Moore, many of the men’s wives, and Mrs. Thomas AlvaEdison, who was representing her husband.Martin presided over the occasion, opening up the period for lectures withreadings of telegrams from those not in attendance. He began with a letter fromthe mayor and then read a communiqué from the Wizard of Menlo Park.> To T. C. Martin:> > I am sorry that I am prevented from attending your annual dinner to-night,> expecially as I would like to pay my respects to Marconi, the young man who> had the monumental audacity to attempt, and succeed in, jumping an electric> wave clear across the Atlantic. Thomas A. Edison9Martin did not announce that at Christmas Marconi had sent Edison a “cheerfultelegram” reiterating his success and offering to display personally to themaster his transatlantic equipment or that Marconi was already tendering Edisonoffers for his early wireless patents.10The New York Times reported “cheers when the toastmaster came to a letter fromNikola Tesla who said that he ‘could not rise to the occasion.’”11 No doubt,they masked the jeers. Grinning through his oversized mustache, Martin waitedfor the clamor to subside before continuing with the rest of the letter:> I regret not being able to contribute to the pleasure of the evening, but I> wish to join the members in heartily congratulating Mr. Marconi on his> brilliant results. He is a splendid worker, full of rare and subtle energies.> May he prove to be one of those whose powers increase and whose mind feelers> reach out farther with advancing years for the good of the world and honor of> his country.Prof. Elihu Thomson followed. “I had received the news of Marconi’s great featfrom over the telephone from a reporter, who wished to know whether I believedthat signals had actually been received across the Atlantic.” Riding on theaccolades of the audience, Thomson related his response: “As I told thereporter, if Marconi says that he received the signals, I believe they werereceived.” And then the hero took the pulpit. Waiting gratiously for theapplause to subside, he began.Signor Marconi explained his syntonic wireless system and pointed out that “hehad built very largely on the work of others and mentioned Clerk Maxwell, LordKelvin, Professor Henry and Professor Hertz.” At this time, its most importantuse was for communication between ships. The Italian was pleased to announcethat “over 70 ships now carried his wireless system, 37 for the British navy, 12for the Italian navy, and the remainder on large liners, such as the CunardLine, the North German Lloyd and the Beaver Line. There were also over 20stations in operation…with more on construction.” Marconi addressed the problemof selective tuning and suggested that he had such a system created so that“messages transmitted [from one ship] can in no way be received by any other,except that attuned to receive the message.”12 Stated as bravado, Marconi wasbluffing, as he had no system for creating separate channels.“It is my hope,” Signor Marconi concluded, “that at no great distant date, Ishall bring my system to the point of perfection of allowing friends andrelatives to communicate with each other across the ocean at a small expense.”Professor Pupin concluded. “Referring to claims made that previous to Marconiwireless signals had been transmitted over short distances,” Pupin said,glancing back to the upper dais, “any schoolboy by means of an Hertzianoscillator could transmit such signals over a short distance…but it required theengineer to make [such] work of avail to the world.” In attempting to allayfears that Marconi’s system would make obsolete Atlantic cables, Dr. Pupinshrewdly “pointed out, as an illustration, how the completion of electriclighting has aided the gas industry and enhanced rather than decreased the valueof [their] investments.”13On January 9, Tesla dispatched a letter to Morgan explaining that the patents ofthe “Marconi-Fleming syndicate” do not accurately reflect their actual apparatusbut are covered “by my patents of 1896 [and] 1897.” The balance of the letterdescribes the precursor to what became, a half century later, the majortelevision networks:> I need not tell you that I have worked as hard as I have dared without> collapsing…Hav[ing] examined and rejected hundreds of experiments…with the> capital at command, I am glad to say that by slow and steady advances, I have> managed to continue a machine…[which shall produce] an electrical disturbance> of sufficient intensity to be perceptible over the whole of the earth…[When] I> throw the switch, I shall send a greeting to the whole world and for this> great triumph I shall ever be grateful to you…> > [This system] will do away not only with the cables but with the newspapers> also, for how can journals as the present [stay in business] when every> [customer] can have a cheap machine printing its own world news?> > [The] beautiful invention which I am now developing, will enable me to spread> our name into [every] home, and it will be [able] everywhere to [hear] the> tune of my voice.14This would be the inventor’s last communiqué to the financier for fully ninemonths. He set himself the difficult task of completing construction of theeighteen-story transmission tower, knowing full well that he did not havesufficient funds. From bank records dating back to 1896, it is apparent thatTesla had nearly $50,000, some of which had been converted into land assets.15The last of Morgan’s money had probably been received, so it was at this time,in the midst of 1902, that the trailblazer began to tap his personal reserves tokeep the project going. Work would continue at a steady pace throughout theyear.OTHER COMPETITORSHaving received his doctorate in electrical engineering in 1899, Lee De Foresthad tried once again to gain entrée into his idol’s laboratory, but for a thirdtime Tesla refused him. De Forest decided, therefore, to set out on his own. In1901 he succeeded in sending wireless messages across the Hudson River over adistance of one or two miles and shortly thereafter sent impulses from StateStreet, in downtown New York, to Staten Island, seven miles away. By using“self-restoring detectors with telephone receivers instead of Morse inkers orsounders,” De Forest succeeded in increasing substantially the speed oftransmission. Now his apparatus threatened Western Union’s local telegraphlines. Working with D. McFarlan Moore, who had “studied Tesla’s monumental earlyvolume,” De Forest was able to decrease the problems of static interference. By1903 he was reporting yacht races at a speed of twenty-five to thirty words perminute, or about as fast as a Morse-code operator could send them. By 1904 hecould transmit messages “180 miles over land, between Buffalo and Cleveland,”and by 1908 his signaling device was jumping continents.16Perhaps it was because of Tesla’s regard for the Yale graduate or because of thecanniness of his patents that Tesla did not try to prevent De Forest from usinghis oscillators and general scheme. The same, however, could not be said forReginald Fessenden, whom he sued for patent infringement in April 1902.Fessenden, who had worked for both Edison and Westinghouse as far back as theearly 1880s, is generally credited with having invented the means of sendingvoice over the airwaves. Although Marconi was using the electromagneticfrequencies to mimic the impulse patterns of the Morse code, “it occurred toFessenden to send out a continuous signal with the amplitude of the waves varied(or ‘modulated’) to make the variation follow the irregularities of sound waves.At the receiving station, these variations could be sorted out and reconvertedinto sound. In 1906 the first such message was sent out from the Massachusettscoast, and wireless receivers could actually pick up the music. In this wayradio, as we know it, was born.”17 A year later, using his patented audion,which was, in essence, a modification of Tesla’s ‘brush tube,’ De Forestsucceeded in transmitting the voice of Enrico Caruso, who was singing at theMetropolitan Opera House in New York.18Interested for reasons of priority in obtaining Edison’s grasshopper wirelesspatent (dating from the 1880s), Fessenden sought a job with GE in 1902 toinaugurate construction of a wireless transmitting station at Brant Rock,Massachusetts. Although he stayed friendly with Edison and looked after hiswayward son, Tom Junior, who had been caught passing bad checks, Fessenden wasunsuccessful in obtaining Edison’s key wireless patent; the Menlo Park wizardhad sold it to Marconi for $60,000.19Legal entanglements were expensive, but Tesla felt that he had no choice but toprotect as many fundamental aspects of his system as he was able to. How elsecould he prove to Morgan that his work in the field really was the basis of thesystems that were succeeding?In June 1900, Reginald Fessenden had applied for a patent on tuned circuits. Thefollowing month, Tesla filed for one as well. It was a matter of public recordthat Fessenden’s application preceded Tesla’s. What was at issue was whether ornot Fessenden had compiled his invention from Tesla’s earlier experiments.Although Fessenden claimed that he had conceived the idea in 1898, Tesla pointedout that Fessenden was (1) unable to provide documentation of this earlier date;(2) he did not create a working model of his apparatus; and (3) the machine hadnot been used commercially.Whereas Fessenden’s application was rudimentary, Tesla’s delineated clearly amultiplicity of goals, for example, (1) operating distant apparatus; (2)controlling signals by using two or more idiosyncratic electrical frequencies;(3) producing a plurality of distinctive impulses onto a receiving apparatuscomprising a manifold number of circuits; and (4) creating a combinationtransmitter-receiver arrangement set up to respond to a succession of impulsesreleased in a given order. Whereas Fessenden could date his theoreticalconceptualizations to, perhaps, 1898, Tesla dated the onset of his work to 1889and provided his numerous publications as evidence. With specific reference tothe operation of “tuned circuits,” the inventor displayed his fully workingtelautomaton, which he introduced to the world in 1898. Without Tesla’s ACoscillators, Fessenden’s machinery could not operate. Unless he had lived in ahermitage, it would have been impossible for Fessenden to have conceived hisinvention without utilizing Tesla’s attainments. Parker W. Page questioned hisclient for hours; Tesla’s testimony would run seventy-two typewritten pages.Throughout mid-April the testimony continued, and after Tesla was finished, histwenty-nine-year-old manager, George Scherff, took the stand. Scherff, who wasliving at Wardenclyffe by this time, was able to substantiate that Tesla’s tunedcircuits and long-distance wireless experiments were first conducted in hispresence in 1895, when he began working for Tesla at his laboratory at 33-35South Fifth Avenue (before it burned to the ground). Scherff remembered theinventor transmitting wireless impulses from the Houston Street lab to the roofof the Hotel Gerlach, which was one or two miles away.20Fritz Lowenstein, just a year younger than Scherff, followed. Having returnedfrom Europe in February and newly married, Lowenstein had gained reemploymentwith Tesla at Wardenclyffe. In a heavy German accent, Lowenstein thoroughlydescribed the nature of the confidential experiments at Colorado Springs. “Mr.Tesla explained to me,” Lowenstein stated, “that the chief feature of apractical wireless telegraph system was the secrecy, immunity and selectivity;at the same time he explained to me how two oscillations are secured from oneoscillating apparatus…When I came to Mr. Tesla,” the college-educated engineerrevealed, “I didn’t understand anything at all about it, but he soon showed methe great value [of] tuned circuits, and then I understood what tuning was.”21> Dear Mr.Scherff,> > Mr. Page has just told me that my opponent’s attorney has admitted my> priority…[Mr. Fessenden] must be disappointed of course, and I am sorry for> him although you know he has written some articles which are not very nice…My> honor as the originator of the principle is assured.22Tesla may have won the case, but he was not about to celebrate. Foremost amonghis priorities was his wish to keep the details of the litigation secret. Thelast thing he wanted was publicity, for the transcripts of the trial revealedmany technicalities that would aid his competition in numerous ways. In theshort run, the inventor succeeded in protecting important aspects of hiswireless scheme; but in the long run the testimony became an important sourcetext for Fessenden, who now had a legal basis for fashioning a plethora ofsecond-order patents. By the time of his death, Fessenden had compiled anastounding five hundred patents, which was nearly as many as Tom Edison.Obviously, this work also aided Lowenstein, who became a wireless expertvaluable to different members of the new crop of engineers who were rapidlyemerging."},{"pageContent":"33WARDENCLYFFE (1902-1903) [002-toc.html#ch33]> While the tower itself is very picturesque, it is the wonders hidden> underneath it that excite the curiosity of the little [hamlet].

His records for 1902 reveallittle activity for the first third of the year except for the month of March.Extended note taking really began again in May and continued uninterruptedlyuntil July 1903. Each week, Tesla watched the tower attain a new height as heexperimented by measuring the capacitance of his apparatus and constructing aprototype planet to calculate “his theory of current propagation through theEarth.” On this sizable metal sphere, the inventor would transmit varyingfrequencies to measure the voltage, wavelength, and velocity of the transmittedenergy and also assess various nodal points, such as along the equator and atthe pole opposite the point of generation.2In February 1902, along with Stanford White, Tesla entertained Prince Henry ofPrussia who had come to New York to retrieve a royal yacht that had been builtin America. The brother of Kaiser Wilhelm, it had been Prince Henry who hadassisted in the performance of the inventor’s famous experiments under Tesla’sname in Berlin six years earlier. The yacht was being christened by AliceRoosevelt, daughter of the president.3 In June out at Wardenclyffe, “twogrey-haired East Hampton pilgrims drop[ped] in on their way to a Springretreat.”4 Kate’s eyes glowed as she broke off from Robert and Nikola toapproach the tower and feel it with her own hands. A radiant warmth flowedthrough her being as she watched the lanky engineer converse with her husband.By September, the transmitter had reached its full elevation of 180 feet.Exhausted of funds, with still the dome to place on top, the inventor had nochoice but to wind down activities and lay off most of the workers. Tesla hadsold his last major asset, a $35,000 land holding, but even that could not keepthe operation fully afloat. Nevertheless, with this new source of revenue, heprocured enough funds to keep a skeleton crew, cover Scherff’s and his ownlodging, and pay for a chef from the Waldorf to come out at regular intervals.Tesla also took this time to photograph the interior operations of his entireplant. These pictures not only included reproductions of all his machinery butalso contained a representative sample of the myriad different types of radiotubes that the inventor had designed. They numbered nearly a thousand.5The Port Jefferson Echo reported “War between Marconi and Tesla” in theirheadlines in 1902. According to the paper, the United States Marconi Company hadpurchased land west of Bridgehampton and was planning on constructing its owncompeting 185-foot tower, with New York City connections to Western Union. “Itshould become the most important wireless center in the country.” WhereasMarconi was going to send his signals through the air, the paper said, Teslaplans, through his “500-foot deep” shaft, to send messages through the earth aswell. Though the hollow was 120 feet, the gist of the report was accurate.Having first sent an emissary, Marconi himself hired a horse and buggy one rainymorning to go out to Wardenclyffe to meet with Tesla and see the operation withhis own eyes.6 Marconi’s limitations became apparent in conversation, and thisgave Tesla the courage to return to see Morgan. He had stayed out of Morgan’sway for nearly a year, but now it was clear to the inventor that once hispartner realized the work accomplished with so little funds at hand, he wouldreconsider his position and agree to resume investment. All the inventor had todo was change the man’s mind.On September 5, Tesla wrote the financier to inform him that the foreign patentshad been assigned to the company. The letter explained clearly that his wirelesssystem ensured privacy and had the ability to create a virtually infinite numberof separate channels that were dependent not only on particular combinations ofdiffering frequencies but also on “their order of succession.” In essence, theinventor had explained to Morgan the concepts inherent in such devices as theprotected channels on cable TV, digital recording, and the wireless telephonescrambler.In the letter, Tesla explained that he was forced to increase the power of hisapparatus because of “bold appropriations” of his equipment (Marconi’s piracy),but his mea culpa also betrayed paranoid tendencies, even though he wasattempting reconciliation: “The only way to fully protect myself was to developapparatus of such power as to enable me to control effectively the vibrationsthroughout the globe. Now, if I had received this necessity earlier, I wouldhave gone to Niagara, and with the capital you have so generously advanced, Icould have accomplished this easily. But unfortunately my plans were alreadymade and I could not change. I endeavored once to explain this to you, much tomy sorrow, as I impressed you wrongly. Nothing remained then but to do the bestI could under the circumstances.”Morgan’s response was utter astonishment. Tesla had not only reiterated thebreach of contract but had also revealed a striking flaw in his plan. Whereas hewould have to haul in continuing truckloads of coal to provide the energyrequired to fire up his transmitter on Long Island, if he had set up operationsat Niagara, there would have been easy access to unlimited amounts of power, andthus the operation would have been considerably less expensive to initiate.Furthermore, there was a standing offer by Rankine and his associates to providepower at the Falls for little or no cost, thereby reducing potential expenseseven more. Nevertheless, Tesla incredibly informs Morgan that even on LongIsland he could outdo the power of the giant cataract.“By straining every part of my machinery to the utmost,” Tesla wrote, “I shallbe able to reach…a rate of energy delivery of 10 millions of horse power.” Thisproduction, he proclaimed, would be equal to “more than twice that of the entireFalls of Niagara. Thus the waves generated by my transmitter will be thegreatest spontaneous manifestation of energy on Earth…the strongest effectproduced at a point diametrically opposite the transmitter which in thisinstance is situated a few hundred miles off the western coast of Australia.”Whether or not this statement was true, it was counterproductive to divulgethis. (Most likely Tesla is discussing the production of a single massive burstof electrical energy rather than a continuous, never-ending flow. In eithercase, having spent a year in the outbacks of Colorado, the bon vivant was notabout to give up his lifestyle at the elegant Waldorf for another lonelyexcursion to the dreary location near Buffalo.) Neurotically impelled , theinventor was stirred to impress the financial magnate when all Morgan wanted wasto signal ocean liners and send Morse code to Europe.Later in the letter the inventor did address this more modest task ofbroadcasting simple messages. Over transmission lines, dispatches from New YorkTelegraph & Cable could be delivered to Wardenclyffe, where they could then bedistributed to Europe by means of wireless to a central receiving station.> Since your departure, Mr. Morgan, I have had time to reflect…[on] the> importance and scope of your work, and I now see that you are no longer a man,> but as a principle and that every spark of your vitality must be preserved for> the good of your fellowmen.

Tesla7Perhaps it was the finale or the inventor’s rank or maybe the realization of thevalue of the fundamental patents that continued to flow into his office, but forwhatever reason, Morgan was moved to the point of allowing another meeting—aslong as it was expressly understood that the liaison would still be keptunpublicized.8Tesla’s plan was to seek new investors by selling bonds and capitalizing thecompany at $10 million. What he did not realize was that his silent partnerwanted to maintain his 51 percent control over the patents, take in “about image39 [images/image-39.jpg] of the securities,” and also be reimbursed for hisinitial investment.9 In other words, whereas Tesla required about an additional$150,000 to complete the tower, pay off his debts, construct the receivingequipment, and so on, the Wall Street hydra wanted his money back in full,wanted to maintain his large share of the concern, wanted the inventor to raisethe funds on his own, and wanted no one to know of his connection to theproject! If Tesla were to agree to all that, they would have a deal.Kate gazed out her window at the changing colors of the leaves as she went overthe Thanksgiving menu with Agnes.“Do you think he’ll come, Momma?”“Of course he will.”“He didn’t last year.”“Mr. Tesla was not himself,” Katharine stated matter-of-factly. Sitting by afizzling Edison lightbulb, she penned an urgent notice and hired a specialmessenger to deliver it.Tesla was working on his list of prospective investors when a loud banging athis door interrupted him. “Sorry, sir, it is important.”The inventor grabbed the letter and ripped it open. Thoughts of accident anddeath flashed through his brain as he reflected upon his relationship with theJohnsons and his inability to deal with them now. He wrote back:> Some day I will tell you just what I think of people who mark their letters> “important” or send dispatches at night.> > You know I would travel 1000 miles to have such a great treat as one of Mrs.> Filipov’s dinners, but this Thanksgiving day I have a great many hard nuts to> crack and I will pass it in quiet meditation.

I am with you in spirit.> > With love to all and Agnes in particular,> > Nikola10With this painful letter, Tesla succeeded in transferring some of his anguish tohis friends. Not only would he not attend the November holiday feast; he wouldalso not partake of the Christmas festivities. Unable to escape himself or dighis way out of the deep hole he was in, he passed the time cranking out ways toenlist new investors.When Katharine realized the depth of the inventor’s despair, she became alarmed.The emptiness at such an important occasion was almost too much to bear. “Agnes,please write Mr. Tesla once again and tell him that he may stop by at any timethat he likes, and forever long he wants.”“Don’t you think he knows what he is doing,” Robert interrupted. “He needs to beby himself right now.”“Don’t tell me what he needs!” Kate exploded, her Irish temper flaring. “Do it,”she commanded her daughter. Robert moved quietly into the living room to read abook of poems.As Agnes sat down to write, a peculiar dark and twisted expression passed overher mother’s face. Kate retired to her boudoir to sit there in her gloom. Teslawrote, “My dear Agnes,” back two days after the new year. “I have no time butplenty of love and friendship for all of you. I would like very much to see you,but it is impossible. Even kings are beginning to infringe my patent rights, andI must restrain myself.”11Katharine could take solace in the fact that her platonic aficionado had usedthe word love twice in two letters. In his own peculiar way, he had transformedthe pain of his career to their linkage, and in that sense, he had reached out,as never before, but it was by withdrawing, and this made her love him more.Thomas Commerford Martin may have had mixed feelings about having supported sovigorously a man he knew had infringed on Tesla’s patents, but Martin had warnedTesla nearly five years earlier that whereas Marconi was succeeding on thephysical plane, Tesla appeared to advance mostly in theory. A social gadfly,Martin had also upped his prestige considerably by hosting the gala Marconiaffair, and he continued to elevate his standing among the upper echelon of theelectrical community. Harper’s decided to do a feature on him, and Edison wasbecoming amenable to the idea of allowing him to write his biography.12 As aprecursor to the new venture, the editor prepared for the weekly a short pieceon the “volcanic lifetime of a master who has produced a patent every fortnightfor over thirty years.”> An “Edison Man” remains an Edison man to the end of the chapter, and is proud> of the stamp left upon his career by the great spirit with whom trials and> triumphs have been shared…[Although] Edison has always been surrounded by a> willing host of workers, [he] has always held easily his leadership among> them. This is by no means true of other[s]…Some powerful thinkers, whether> from instinctive distrust or unavowed jealousy, endeavor to hammer out their> conceptions in lonely struggle, and names could be mentioned here of> electrical inventors whose curse seems to be this sterile seclusion. In> Edison’s case, the sunny, kindly temperament of the man makes for> friendship.13Martin was almost certainly talking about Tesla here, and in so doing, hehighlighted ponderous debilities in the inventor’s personality. Tesla could beinordinately withdrawn, private, “distrustful,” an elitest, and yet envious ofothers, unable to share in the development of his ideas lest he would have toshare credit. Later in this article, Martin wrote that “a great many first-classinventors are sharply concentrated along one line,” while Edison had “many ironsin the fire.” As versatile and incredibly prolific as Tesla was, he stuck, untilthe end of his days, to the single monumental Wardenclyffe idea when any aspectof the grand plan, in and of itself, would have been a revolutionaryaccomplishment.Underneath it all, however, Martin was, without doubt, the one individual whohad accomplished the most toward explicating the wondrous achievements of thesequestered genius, and his connection to Tesla would remain sacred to him forthe duration of his life. Martin took the opportunity to let Tesla know thiswhen he gave the inventor an updated version of the collected works.“Many thanks for the book,” Tesla wrote his old-time friend. “It was a pleasureto read the dedication which tells me that your heart is true to Nikola.”14 Thisoccasion served to break the ice again, and the two resumed their friendship,albeit not with the same intensity as before.In a dreadful predicament, the inventor was beginning to stare down a canyon ofdoom, writing his letters now in pencil, abandoning the certainty of the pen.> Ever since I was a boy I was desirous of drawing on the Bank of England. Can> you blame me? I confess my low commercial interests dominate me…Will you> please give me a list of people almost as prominent and influential as the> Johnsons who desire to get into high society. I will send them my letter.> > Nikola Busted15Forced to approach both the Johnsons and his manager, George Scherff, for funds,both lent him thousands over the next few years.16 Simultaneously, he returnedto former enthusiasts such as Mrs. Dodge and Mrs. Winslow, and new investors,such as Mrs. Schwarz, wife of toy store owner F. A. O. Schwarz.17 The price forinvestment was $175 for each share.With his back to the wall, he approached again his Wall Street benefactor. “Willyou now let me go from door to door to humiliate myself to solicit funds fromsome jew or promoter and have him participate in that gratitude which I have foryou?,” he wrote Morgan. “I am tired of speaking to pusillanimous people whobecome scared when I ask them to invest $5000 and get the diarrhoea when I callfor ten.”18MAD SCIENTIST> “It is a mighty fine tower,” said one good farmer…last week. “The breeze up> there is something grand of a Summer evening, and you can see the Sound and> all the steamers that go by. We are tired, though, trying to figure out why he> put it here instead of Coney Island.”19Although operations were suspended, there were many avenues the inventor wouldexplore in his attempts to complete the vision. One of his first decisions wasto comply with George Scherff’s plan to become more pragmatic. Throughout thebalance of the year and much of 1903, Tesla began to manufacture oscillators andcontinue development of his fluorescent lamps. Revenues began to trickle in, andby midyear he had compiled enough savings to hire back a half-dozen workers andpay for the cupola, which was placed at the apex of the spire.20 Over fifty feetin diameter, ten feet tall, and weighing fifty-five tons, this iron-and-steelcrown, with its specially designed multitude of nodal points, would serve thepurpose of storing electrical charges and distributing them either through theair or down the metal column and into the hollow. The cupola was linked to fourlarge condensers behind the laboratory, which also served the purpose of storingelectrical energy, and these in turn were coupled with “an elaborate apparatus”which had the ability to provide “every imaginable regulation…in the control ofenergy.”image 17 [images/image-17.jpg]J. Pierpont Morgan: one of numerous political cartoons poking fun at the mostpowerful financier in the world, circa 1901At the base of the edifice, deep below the earth, along the descending spiralstaircase, was a network of catacombs that extended out like spokes of a wheel.Sixteen of them contained iron pipes which protruded from the central shaft to adistance of three hundred feet. The expense for these “terrestrial grippers” wasnotable, as Tesla had to design “special machines to push the pipes, one afterthe other” deep into the earth’s interior.21 Also in the well were fourstone-lined tunnels, each of which gradually rose back to the surface. Largeenough for a man to crawl through, they emerged like isolated, igloo-shapedbrick ovens three hundred feet from the base of the tower.Although the exact reason for the burrows has not been determined, theirnecessity was probably multifaceted. Tesla had increased the length of theaerial by over a hundred feet by extending the shaft into the earth.Simultaneously, he was able to more easily transmit energy through the groundwith this arrangement. It is possible that he also planned to resonate theaquifer which was situated slightly below the bottom of the well. The insulatedpassageways which climbed back to the surface may have been safety valves, whichwould have allowed excess pressure to escape. They also provided an alternativeway to access the base. Tesla may have planned to fill other shafts with saltwater or liquid nitrogen to augment transmission. There may have also been otherreasons for their construction.22Just as the inventor prepared to test his new equipment, creditors began toencroach more vigorously and Tesla was never able to put the final fireproofprotective outer facing on the cupola and tower. To Westinghouse he owed nearly$30,000,23 the phone company was billing him for the telephone poles and lineswhich they erected to connect him with civilization,24 and James Warden wassuing for taxes owed on the land.25 With the exigency of time inexorablypressing down, the inventor worked furiously to link his transmitter to thepower source and test its potentialities.Throughout the early part of 1903 the engineer “performed many measurements ofground resistance and insulation resistance of the tower. He even consideredtemperature [increases] caused by ground losses, differences when salty waterwas spread around the base, weather conditions and time of day.”26In the last week of July, just days before men came to cart away part of hisequipment, the inventor fashioned a way to couple his behemoth and fire it up.As pressures reached their maximum with the cupola fully charged, a dull thunderrumbled from the site, alerting the hamlet that something was about to happen.> Strange Light at Tesla’s Tower> > From the top of Mr. Tesla’s lattice work tower on the north shore of Long> Island, there was a vivid display of light several nights last week. This> phenomena [sic] provoked the curiosity of the few people who live near by, but> the proprietor of the Wardencliffe [sic] plant declined to explain the> spectacle when inquiries were addressed to him.27Tesla’s mushroom-shaped citadel spewed forth a pyrotechnic eruption that couldbe gleaned not only by those who lived nearby but also by the populaceinhabitating the shores of Connecticut, across Long Island Sound. But by the endof July the tower fell silent, never to raise its radio cry again.It was a foggy morning when the Westinghouse crew appeared with theirhorse-drawn wagon and court order granting them permission to cart away theheavier equipment. The gargantuan edifice loomed as a specter of what could be,its head still obscured by the low-hanging clouds. Except for a guard, GeorgeScherff, and a handyman, the entire crew was let go. His dream now hobbled, thesullen wizard crept back to the city to weep alone in his Waldorf suite."},{"pageContent":"34THE WEB (1903-1904) [002-toc.html#ch34]> July 14, 1903> > Dear Sir:> > I have received your letter…and in reply would say that I should not feel> disposed at present to make any further advances.> > Yours truly,> J. Pierpont Morgan1Mr. Boldt removed his monocle from his top vest pocket and eyed the mansuspiciously. The foreigner was sweating profusely from the August heat. “NikoTezlê,” he said in a heavy accent as he handed the hotel manager a crinkledenvelope.Momentarily sidetracked by a spot of dust, Boldt retrieved the document toinspect Tesla’s letterhead. “You may go up,” he said disdainfully as he slammedhis hand down on the clangor to call a bellhop.The man entered what appeared to him to be a palatial suite. “Jovan, so good ofyou to come,” the venerated engineer said in his native tongue. “You must findUncle Petar. It is a matter of utmost urgency.”“He may be in Bosnia.”“Then go there.” Tesla handed the man a round trip boat ticket, a communiquesealed with wax, and a billfold of spending money. “I am depending on you.”2Tesla’s three sisters, Angelina Trbojevich, Milka Glumicic and Marica Kosanovic,their husbands, all Serbian priests, and all of their children sat in therectory to listen to the spell-binding account the courier brought of Niko’slaboratory and world telegraphy tower. “Its head reaches up to the clouds,”Jovan said, spreading his arms to their full extent, “and some day it will sendmessages to the whole world—right here to this town.” Jovan’s cousins gasped inamazement as he passed around a photograph taken just three months earlier byDickenson D. Alley, the photographer also responsible for the Coloradopictures.3“How will we know when a message is sent?”“Everyone will have a little device, the size of”—Jovan looked around the roomand spotted a prayer book—“the size of this book, with a wire attached which youwill stick into the ground to receive the message!”Two first cousins, Nicholas Trbojevich and Sava Kosanovic, both just emergingfrom boyhood, listened intently. Fully captivated by such news from America,Nicholas announced proudly, “Some day I will be an inventor too.” Sava, destinedforty years later to be Yugoslavia’s first ambassador to America, smiled backand nodded in agreement.Uncle Petar stepped from the room to open the dispatch in private. Niko had toldhis uncle that the Panic had hit him hard, that he was out of funds. He wouldhave to close down the World Telegraphy Center if assistance was not receivedimmediately. He asked Petar to go to a local bank and borrow funds using sharesin Wardenclyffe as collateral. The bank, of course, would not comply,4 so Petarcalled a meeting with family elders for a pooling of resources. They thenreturned to Belgrade, where the transfer of funds could be accomplished. “Youwish Niko well for us,” Petar said, grasping Jovan with both arms. Teslareceived the money by the end of the month, but it was really only enough tokeep a door open for the balance of the year.> September 13, 1903> > Dear Mr. Morgan,> > Many years I was at your door with this invention, but I did not go in> thinking it would be useless…My last undertaking has returned more that two> dozen times the original investment and this in strong hands should do better> still.> > Help me to complete this work and you will see.> > Yours most faithfully,> N. Tesla5Altering his schedule, the inventor began visiting the lab only on weekends.Having thought the matter through, he abandoned the idea of meeting withsmall-time investors and placed his efforts in two separate directions. He wouldstep up the manufacture of the oscillators and enlist other tycoons.6 With themoney from his relatives, Tesla was able to hire back a few workers. Operations,however, were just about nil, and the rest of the crew were angry about notbeing paid.“You know, of course,” he told Scherff, “that when this panic came, a great manymanufacturers simply dismissed their men. Our employees should understand that Ihave tried to treat them generously in the hardest times this country has known,and they should be grateful instead of impatient. Although the panic ispractically over, there is still a general feeling of apprehension on thestreet. However, I have a few irons in the fire, and at any moment, I may comeup with the solution which confronts me. I am more than ever assured thatnothing can prevent my ultimate success.”7Tesla’s first stop was the home of John Jacob Astor. Taking with him Alley’s newdramatic glossies, the inventor tried his best to reignite the flame. Astor, whowas earning approximately $3 million per annum, was nevertheless not a frivolousman. Most of his money these days was being spent on his yacht, the Nourmahal.Whereas Tesla had had an ally in Astor’s wife, the marriage was now in decline,with Ava spending most of her time in Europe with her two small children and herhusband, Jack, continuing his practice of straying at home.8 “While wishing youall possible luck,” Astor wrote the inventor, “do not care to go into thecompany myself.”9Deciding that there were other fish in the sea worth hooking, Tesla compiled alist of the biggest ones and worked with a graphic designer to produce a flashymailer. Known as the “Tesla Manifesto,” the pamphlet boldly announced theexpectations of his world telegraphy enterprise.10Folded into a maroon vellum binder, the brochure contained lavish prints of theColorado Station and also the imposing laboratory and tower at Wardenclyffe, alist of relevant patents, past and future accomplishments, a statement of hisavailability to be hired as a consultant, and a declaration of the breadth andscope of his plan, all of this surrounded by a scalloped design of pen-and-inkdrawings of his many other inventions. Atop the new magnifying transmitter,drawn as part of the frame in fancy cursive, were the following words:“Electrical Oscillator Activity Ten Million Horsepower.” People on his listincluded numerous moguls, each worth anywhere between $20 and $200 million, justabout all personally known by the inventor.“Luka,” Tesla wrote to Robert Johnson, “Rockefeller and Harriman are now takingup every moment of my time, but I think I shall get through with them veryshortly.”11 Written partly in jest, this letter was not far from the truth, forTesla was becoming more successful in penetrating a number of other wealthyenclaves.> An Interview with Wizard Edison> > “Do you believe, [Mr. Edison] with Tesla that we should be able to talk around> the world one of these days?”> > “No, I do not look for developments in that line.

The public at large had yet to know of the Morganconnection, and yet Tesla had to inform potential investors of his interest. Dueto animosities that Morgan still held for Harriman, a contract with him was outof the question, but there were still many other financiers to consider.On October 12, 1903, Tesla met with Thomas Fortune Ryan. A stalwart, corpulentman five years Tesla’s senior, Ryan, whose real middle name was Falkner, hadgotten his start as a dry-goods clerk in Baltimore. His break came after hemoved to Wall Street, where he became a stockbroker and investor in largefinancial institutions. By 1905 his position had grown so extensively that hegained control of nearly $1.4 billion, which was equivalent to almost half ofthe entire public debt of the United States. Almost one-third of this figurestemmed from his acquisition of the controlling shares of Equitable LifeAssurance Society,13 and this came about a little over a year after his initialmeeting with Tesla. In and of itself, the connection would appear to beincidental; however, it was Tesla who arranged for a meeting between Ryan andMorgan in attempts to iron out an amenable agreement, and it is well known thatMorgan was the secret power behind the famous Equitable Life insurance scandalwhich erupted in 1905.Aside from the handful of diamonds he perpetually fondled in his palm, Ryan’sother assets included control over Mutual Life and Washington Life Insurance,New York City Railway, American Tobacco, Morton Trust, Metropolitan Securities,and Mercantile Trust. Ryan also sat on the board of a dozen other insurance,banking, rail, and utility concerns.14 He also owned an immense estate coveringhundreds of acres north of the city, near Monticello, where he had erected a$500,000 mansion. From this retreat, his wife, Mrs. T. F. Ryan made a name forherself as a philanthropist, founding a theological institution, erecting “amagnificent Catholic Church [and] a public hospital, [purchasing] fire companyequipment, and [making] scores of minor contributions for the good of thevillage.”15Known for his “striking [proficiency] of systematic organization…decisiveaction, secrecy and the art of using great power behind the throne,” Ryan’s mosteffective gift was his persuasive ability. “Mr. Ryan makes his headquarters inthe Morton Trust Company’s office, where he is Vice-President. He does not barthe door like John D. Rockefeller…Any caller gets to his secretary and veryoften to the inner room. There is none of the gruffness that so characterizesMr. Morgan…Mr. Ryan is suavely silent…He never does and never says an importantthing without consulting lawyers…Yet he always is polite, and never showsanger.”16Tesla had calculated that he required approximately $100,000 to complete hisproject, so his plan was to enlist “ten subscribers at $10,000 each.”“What is the use of going to so many people,” Ryan suggested, staring at thecontents of the vellum binder. “I shall take one-fourth. Where do I sign?”17Obviously, this was a great opportunity, but it was not a simple matter of justsigning a paper. Tesla had to go back to Morgan to confer, and $25,000 wouldstill leave him way short of his goal. “Would you consider underwriting theentire $100,000?”“That’s a possibility.”“Let me speak to my partner about your generous offer and get back to you.”“Is it anyone that I know?” Ryan inquired.“I am under orders to keep his name confidential.”“We are talking about a significant amount of money, Mr. Tesla. I want to knowwho I am going into business with.”“It is Pierpont Morgan,” the inventor said cryptically.“Morgan! Well, then, you couldn’t be in better hands.”Tesla wrote Morgan on the following day to arrange a meeting. “Mr. Ryan is agreat admirer and a loyal friend of yours and for this reason as well as onaccount of his ability, I am very anxious to enlist his cooperation. I have toldhim that $100,000 would be sufficient to reach the first commercial results,which will pave the way to other greater successes. Knowing your generousspirit, I have told Mr. Ryan that any terms you may decide upon will besatisfactory to me.”18For Thanksgiving, Tesla joined the Johnsons. He had good news to report. Justback from a two-month stint in Europe, Robert and Kate were eager to describetheir meeting with Queen Elena of Italy. Having been decorated by King Humbertin 1895 for his work on the international copyright, Robert was received by thewidowed queen as a distinguished personage. He read to her and the queen mothera selection from his most recent book of poems.19 They also stayed a few extraweeks to witness the jubilee at the Vatican, celebrating twenty-five years ofthe reign of Pope Leo XIII.“Mr. Tesla, do I detect a gleam in your eye?” Kate inquired.“You’re not about to become one of the detested wealthy elite, are you?” Robertteased.“My dear Luka, I do not want you to despise millionaires, as I am hard at workto become one. My stocks have gone up considerably this week.”“Morgan?” Katharine whispered hopefully.“Fortune Ryan,” Tesla said, taking out a bank note to display proudly. He wouldreceive a total of $10,000 from the financier. “If it continues for a few weekslike this, the globe will be girdled soon. Now Kate, where’s that turkey?”20At this time, Morgan met with Ryan. Obviously, the Tesla deal did not gothrough. The question is, why?Every indication suggests that the meeting went well. Ryan had been described byWheeler (one of Morgan’s harshest critics) as “a most adroit, suave andnoiseless man,”21 and this makes some sense, for a few years later it wouldbecome evident that Ryan was, in essence, a Morgan puppet.In 1899, Henry Hyde passed away. He had been controller of thehalf-billion-dollar Equitable Life Assurance Society, “comprising the scrapingsof the poor.”22 Fifty-one percent of the company was left to his son James, whowas twenty-three at the time. A rather eccentric and naive millionaire, Jamescharged the company for petty extravagances, such as importing barbers fromFrance and placing his personal chefs at all of his favorite restaurants. Themuckrakers were unable to tolerate the extravagent lifestyle of James,especially after it was learned that on January 31, 1905, he had spent $200,000on a Louis XV costume ball at Sherry’s. They demanded his resignation.No doubt, ever since Hyde’s father had passed on, Morgan had had his eye on thecompany, but because of the Northern Pacific debacle, he had to proceedcautiously. It is plausible to consider that at the meeting concerning the Teslaproject Morgan might have suggested that Ryan’s money could be better spent in adifferent area. Whatever he said, it appears to have been stated in such a wayas to not completely turn off Ryan, as he did invest and maintain interest inthe enterprise from the years 1903 to 1906, although he never paid Tesla morethan the initial modest subscription.In a situation that paralleled the Northern Pacific fiasco, Morgan fought forthe Equitable on one side against Harriman and his broker, Jacob Schiff, anotherfinancier who almost went into the Tesla deal. The end result was an obscuremaneuver whereby Thomas Fortune Ryan was able to purchase the controlling sharesof Equitable for a paltry $2.5 million. Young Hyde moved to France, where heremained for a quarter century.Rumors of mismanagement of the funds of a few million investors continued,however, and Ryan’s picture, throughout the summer of 1905, was slapped on thefront pages of every newspaper in town. Drawn as a rapacious spider in his web,clutching his prey of the Equitable in one political cartoon, Ryan was describedby southern banker and critic John Skelton Williams in a scathing article thatappeared in the World: “Mr. Ryan has the tendencies which, if his lines had beencast in a humble and contracted sphere probably would have made him akleptomaniac. His strongest impulse is to acquire money, and his one robustpassion is to keep it…Ryan is simply an acquiring machine and operates himselffor the purpose of getting what others have.”23Although Morgan, as head of a rival insurance company, supposedly had nointerest in Equitable, Herbert Satterlee, his son-in-law, uncharacteristicallyrevealed that Ryan was actually controlled by Morgan, stating that Morgan “wasentirely conversant with Mr. Ryan’s plans…They had his thorough approval andpossibly his financial backing.”24During the government investigations that continued relentlessly throughout thefirst decade of this century, it was discovered that dummy loans totaling $1.8million were made to a fifteen-year-old Negro messenger boy in Morgan’s New YorkLife Insurance Company.25 Ryan also sold his 51 percent interest in Equitable toMorgan for $3 million in 1910. Testimony from the investigation explains quiteclearly Ryan’s role as a Morgan puppet.> Q: Untermeyer: Did Mr. Ryan offer this stock to you?> > A: Morgan: I asked him to sell it to me.> > Q: Untermeyer: Did you tell him why you wanted it?> > A: Morgan: No; I told him it was a good thing for me to have…He hesitated> about it, and finally sold it.Taken from Wheeler’s Pierpont Morgan: Anatomy of a Myth, the author ended thepassage as follows: “During the Panic of 1907, Morgan, in his 71st year, trulymanipulated vast sums and groups of men [including President Theodore Roosevelt]in commanding fashion.”26As “the power behind the throne,” clearly Morgan dominated the conversation whenRyan came to invest in Wardenclyffe. Morgan redirected his new chess piece intothe insurance arena, but this still does not answer the question as to why. IfTesla’s enterprise were perceived to have become potentially profitable, havingRyan put in another $100,000 to complete it would have been an easy thing to do.We can therefore conclude that Morgan deliberately scuttled the Tesla venture.THE GUGGENHEIM CONNECTIONAside from being annoyed with the difficult inventor, Morgan was concerned aboutTesla’s suggestion that he could transmit “unlimited power” by means ofwireless. Tesla was boasting here, since he assured Morgan in future lettersthat Wardenclyffe would only be able to transmit “feeble amounts” of energy.We come to a juncture here where the decisions of individuals redirected thecourse of history. As John Stewart Mill has noted, individuals make the history,and here is a clear instance of this proposition. For all intents and purposes,Morgan made the decision in October 1903 to do his best to ensure the inventor’sdefeat.Morgan, however, was opposed philosophically to Tesla’s overall scheme. It hasbeen suggested that Morgan felt pressure from other Wall Street moguls, such asBernard Baruch, Thomas Fortune Ryan’s young and highly successful stockbroker.One day, Baruch had mistakenly suggested that Morgan, like him, was a gambler.Morgan was reported to reply, “I never gamble,” and, indeed, may have backeddown from the Tesla deal for fear of taking a chance that the controversialinventor might fail or that he might succeed in a way detrimental to existingcorporate structures.The following quotation is from physician and inventor Andrija (Henry) Puharich,a man of Yugoslavian heritage who was tangentially involved in helping shipTesla’s papers to the Tesla Museum in Belgrade in the early 1950s27 and whopersonally knew John O’Neill, Tesla’s first major biographer: “Now, I [Puharich]always got this second hand; you won’t find it anywhere in print, but JackO’Neill gave me this information as the official biographer of Nikola Tesla. Hesaid that Bernard Baruch told J. P. Morgan, ‘Look, this guy is going crazy. Whathe is doing is he wants to give free electrical power to everybody and we can’tput meters on that. We are just going to go broke supporting this guy.’ Andsuddenly, over-night, Tesla’s support was cut off, the work was neverfinished.”28From a technical and economic point of view, Morgan could not understand howfree information and/or power could yield returns. And whether it was Baruch ornot who warned Morgan, Tesla himself had voiced the opinion boldly, a decadeearlier in the Sunday World, that by providing a reservoir of electrical energythroughout the earth through his apparatus, “all monopolies” that depend onconventional means of energy distribution—that is, through wires, “will come toa sudden end.”29As the ultimate capitalist, Morgan’s existence was greatly defined bycontrolling the price and distribution of energy and maintaining a working classto support the giant corporate monopolies (called “public” utilities). Thus, hesimply could not support a system where wireless information and power could betapped by anyone with a receiving instrument and machines would replace the workforce. Reorganizing existing power, lighting, and telephone industries to pleasethe vision of a somewhat eccentric inventor was certainly an unlikelyundertaking for the cautious Wall Street financier. “All those businesses whowould [no longer] need loans [would] then [no longer] deposit the[ir] profits inhis bank.”30 Tesla, as the quintessential iconoclast, had struck a bargain withthe wrong king.31In 1903, Bernard Baruch, just thirty-three years old and one of the wealthiestmen on Wall Street, retired from the firm he had worked for, for over a decade,to set up his own office. One of his first major clients were the Guggenheimbrothers. Their interest lay in metals, so Baruch met with the miners DariusOgden Mills and John Hays Hammond Sr. to seek advice and gain investments. Millssuggested that Baruch go west and purchase mines himself, and Hammond was hiredby the Guggenheims to act as an adviser and acquire silver mines in Mexico. Oneof Baruch’s first acquisitions was the Utah Copper Company, for “he knew thatthere would always be a need for copper in the world.”32 Tesla’s wirelessenterprise clearly threatened the Baruch-Guggenheim investment that Morgan wastrying to involve himself in.By 1905 the Utah Copper Company was producing copper and other metals at a ratein excess of $100 million per year, and this was a pace which maintained itselffor another twenty-five years!33 In later years, John Hays Hammond would claimthat “the development of the electrical and automotive industries werepossible…‘only with assured large supply of copper.’”34 Unfortunately for Tesla,his ultimate world plan was perceived as a threat on quite a number of keyfronts.Tesla waited through the first weeks of December for a positive sign from themeeting between Ryan and Morgan, but none came. With no choice left, he wasforced to confront the financial potentate eyeball to eyeball. He decided totake a pragmatic approach. “Will you permit me to call this or any otherevening,” Tesla wrote, “[I wish] to bring a small instrument along to show youone or two experiments with my ‘daylight’?…The shark who will come after me willget the contract for lighting your home.”35Timing his visit to coincide with the holiday, Tesla purposefully chose thisopportune occasion to try and pierce the financier’s stalwart exterior. But atthe same time, he used the symbol of the shark in his letter, as this was ananimal which ate big fish. Anne Morgan was one of his allies. She met him at thedoor. Having recently become “a founder of the Colony Club, the first Americanladies’ [society], patterned after a British gentlemen’s club” and designed byStanford White, Anne had entered into the midst of an androgenous theater crowdwith ties to the infamous homosexual author Oscar Wilde. With Tesla’s sexualorientation perpetually an enigma and Anne about to dabble in a lesbian fling,36their bond transcended the surface amenities. Before meeting with her father,Anne was able to corral the avowed celibate and discuss with him the emergingview of the new women.“Mr. Tesla, I believe that it is absurd that in this day of enlightenment, womendo not yet have the right to vote.”“I concur wholeheartedly, Anne. I also believe that this struggle of the humanfemale toward sex equality will end up in a new sex order, with the femalessuperior.”“Indeed?” Anne responded, the pupils of her eyes widening into large blackpools. “I would have considered the sexes equal,” she said as her hand reachedout to touch the inventor.“The modern woman, who anticipates in merely superficial phenomenon theadvancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom of something deeper and morepotent fomenting in the bosom of the race. It is not in the shallow physicalimitation of men that women will assert first their equality and later theirsuperiority, but in the awakening of the intellect of women. As generationsensue, the average woman will be as well educated as the average man, and thenbetter educated, for the dormant faculties of her brain will be stimulated intoan activity that will be all the more intense because of centuries of repose.”37“Mr. Morgan will see you now,” the butler interrupted.“Mr. Tesla.”“Mr. Morgan, thank you for seeing me. My enemies have been so successful inrepresenting me as a poet and visionary that it is absolutely imperative for meto put out something commercial without delay. If you will only help me to dothis you will preserve a property of immense value.”“I am sorry, Mr. Tesla, as I said before…”“Won’t you enable me to complete the work and show you that you have not made amistake in giving me a checkbook to draw on your honored house. If you willimagine that I have found the stone of the philosophers you will be not far fromthe truth. My invention will cause a revolution so great that almost all valuesand all human relations will be profoundly modified.”“Had you simply achieved what I had asked, you would not be in thispredicament.”“Mr. Morgan, I beg to call again to your attention that my patents controlabsolutely all essential features and that my work is in such a shape thatwhenever you tell me to go ahead, I shall girdle the globe in three months assurely as my name is Tesla. I have promised to the St. Louis people to open thedoor of the Exposition with power transmitted from here. It is a greatopportunity, Mr. Morgan. I can easily do it, but if you do not aid me soon, itwill be too late. Please think for a moment what this means for me. What I havetold you long ago has happened. My competitors have collapsed, since theirwholesale attempts [at practicable wireless transmission] has not succeeded. Nowis the time to aid me. You know this better than anyone else.”“I have done my part. There are many other businessmen out there with thecapital to complete your project.”“But you, sir, are the controlling partner. Should I obtain a commitment fromanother, will you consider a renegotiation.”“I will think it over.”38Having met with Morgan in December, Tesla not only came away empty-handed; healso came away with the distinct feeling that his partner was not going tofacilitate finding new investors. Avoiding Katharine at Christmastime was oneway to telegraph the bad news. Using a full range of her feminine charms, thecoquettish Mrs. Filipov issued one more of her provocative missives.> December 20, 1903> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > You are most unkind…dear friend!

He feared it.> January 13, 1904> > My dear Sir,> > In reply to your note I regret to say that I should not be willing to advance> any further amounts of money as I have already told you.

Pierpont MorganClose to making deals with other investors but hampered by his relationship toMorgan, Tesla was particularly upuset that his partner replied on the same dayhis own letter was sent. Surmising that Morgan was not even considering thesituation, Tesla became enraged. For the first time he dropped all pretense andtold Morgan what he really thought of him.> January 14, 1904> > Dear Mr. Morgan,> > You wish me success! It is in your hands, how can you wish it?> > We start on a proposition, everything duly calculated; it is financially> frail.

Retaliating in any overt way would have beensuicide. And although Tesla had self-destructive tendencies, breaching acontract with J. Pierpont Morgan being one example, the inventor wanteddesperately to succeed. His goal was not so much to line his own pockets,although surely he sought to get rich from the invention, but rather to helpsociety. Tesla was well aware of his potential role in reshaping the course ofhuman events.Seeing no other choice, he brashly decided, in early 1904, not to hide theMorgan connection anymore but rather to publicize it and to maintain the frontthat everything was okay. To one of his worried investors, William Rankine ofthe Niagara Falls project, he wrote on April 10, “Doubt the light of the sun,doubt the brightness of the stars, but do not doubt the existence of the NikolaTesla Company.”43 Landing Morgan in the first instance had been a feather in hiscap. Now the bon vivant decided to exploit the connection and also brazenlyrebel against a man who seemed bent on sinking his ship. In quintessentialTeslaic fashion, he published a spectacular article simultaneously in ScientificAmerican and Electrical World & Engineer. In it he outlined his work to date andplans for the future, adorning the piece with breathtaking photographs of histransmission stations in Colorado Springs and Wardenclyffe.> The results attained by me have made my scheme of “World Telegraphy” easily> realizable.

Irrational components should be recognized. Thus, and in this sense,history is paradoxical; it is contradictory, dynamic, multileveled, anddialectic.2 Tesla’s worldview involved a philosophy based on the work ofWolfgang von Goethe. His inventions were for him not true creations in the sensethat they stemmed from nothing. They evolved from the work of others and fromuncovering secret mechanisms lying within hidden laws of nature.> Was it God who wrote each sign?> Which, all my inner tumult stilling,> And this poor heart with rapture filling,> Reveals to me, by a force divine,> Great Nature’s energies around and through me> thrilling?> Am I a God? It grows so bright to me!> Each character on which my eye reposes> Nature in act before my soul discloses.This idea can clearly be found in Goethe’s Faust, Tesla’s favorite poem, whichhe memorized in its entirety and which he referred to throughout his life.3 Itwas Faust which he recited in Budapest during his salad days, when he uncoveredthe secret to the rotating magnetic field, and it was a Faustian paradigm towhich he adhered when he linked the invention of the world telegraphy system tothe discovery of the Holy Grail.> There manifests itself in the fully developed being—Man—a desire mysterious,> inscrutable and irresistible: to imitate nature, to create, to work himself> the wonders he perceives…He subdues and puts to his service the fierce,> devastating spark of Prometheus, the titanic forces of the waterfall, the wind> and the tide. He tames the thundering bolt of Jove and annihilates time and> space. He makes the great Sun itself his obedient toiling slave…> > Can man control this grandest, most awe-inspiring of all processes in nature?> Can he harness her inexhaustible energies to perform all their functions at> his bidding?…If he could do this, he would have powers almost unlimited and> supernatural…> > [This] would be the supreme manifestation of the power of Man’s mind, his most> complete triumph over the physical world, his crowning achievement, which> would place him beside his Creator, make him fulfill his ultimate destiny.> Nikola Tesla4Two major themes which run through Goethe’s poem are that (1) secrets of naturecan be revealed and harnessed to human needs and that (2) humans are enticed bysatanic forces. Clearly, Tesla was driven by both tenets. In the second case,consciously or unconsciously, Morgan was sought out for the very reason that hewas a demigod, a superhuman, whose life transcended that of mere mortals. Justas Faust was tempted by Mephistopheles, Tesla was lured by the House of Morgan.In the financier’s “strong hands” Tesla willingly, and alas irrationally, handedover the 51 percent control, insisting on it. Knowing that the contract involvedrelinquishing his cornucopia of past and future patent applications, theinventor still sealed the Faustian pact, as “the terms were immaterial” to him.> MEPHISTOPHELES: Whatever promise on your Books find entry, we strictly carry> into act…for the present I entreat Most urgently your kind dismission.> > FAUST: Do stay but just one moment longer then, tell me good news, and I’ll> release thee.> > Dear Mr. Morgan,> > Since many years I have known one side of your character intimately.

Langley launched a heavier-than-air ship from the roofof a houseboat situated on the Potomac. With photographers from the SmithsonianInstitution present, the craft was slingshot “over the 70 foot rails and in amoment was free upon air. Then it wavered. Down the aerodrome sank…with itsdaring navigator [emerging from]…the disaster…suffering only a ducking.” Thepress called Langley’s airplane “a failure,”6 but Tesla rallied to Langley’sdefense. “Langley has perceived a great truth,” Tesla wrote in the New YorkHerald, namely, that “a machine heavier than air could be made to fly…Such a manshould be provided with the necessary means to complete his work, great honorattaches to this achievement, [and] also great practical utility which thiscountry can ill afford to lose.”7Tesla started off 1904 on the offensive with his manifesto and strikingpublications. Work on the wireless operation was suspended, and essentialcomponents were stripped from the tower and returned to digruntled creditors. Askeleton crew kept up appearances and continued the development of his lamps andoscillators. But as his Wardenclyffe notes reveal, there were no theoreticalwritings during this period;8 all of Tesla’s energies were concentrated in oneavenue: raising the funds to resurrect the project. Tesla’s attorneys hadlocated a manufacturer in Connecticut to “make all the metal parts” of hisoscillators, but there was still the problem of distribution, and the revenueswould not enable him to reopen the Wardenclyffe plant. Another predicament hadto do with Mr. Warden himself. Apparently he had not conducted a title searchwhen he purchased the land, and a legal shadow had fallen on the property. Teslaused the entanglement to further delay payment of the mortgage.9“One consideration,” he wrote Scherff, “is that the Edison-Pupin-Marconicombination, who have given me so much trouble, are in a worse fix.”10In February, Tesla attended a musical recital and party in Gramercy Park hostedby Stanford White and his wife, Bessie, for 350 of his friends, with dinnerafterward at Sherry’s.11 Most likely the inventor crossed paths with Morgan aswell as other potential investors. The following month, the inventor conferredwith the CEO (chief executive officer) of GE, Charles Coffin. “If [the GEpeople] refuse they are simply snoosers,” he wrote Scherff.12 Nothing came ofthe meeting, but in April a solid lead came via John S. Barnes, a well-connectedfinancier who had read Tesla’s article in Electrical World & Engineer. Anassociate of Col. Oliver Payne’s from the Rockefeller clique, Barnes had invitedTesla to his home for dinner and to discuss the inventor’s plans.“I have always had the highest regard for Col. Payne, and would be happy indeedshould he ever deem me worthy of his association.”“We are curious as to the details of the Commodore’s bestowal,” Barnesinterjected.“Mr. Morgan has not made a generous donation as you might have inferred from myarticle,” Tesla craftily retorted. “He is a man with a great brain and has seenthat [by forming a business partnership instead] he can make an extremelyprofitable investment.”13Although hesitant to make a commitment, Barnes nevertheless suggested that Teslahave his lawyers write up their evaluation of his patent applications.Because of his link to Colonel Payne, Tesla took the suggestion very seriously.A multimillionaire from the city of Cleveland, Payne had made his fortune as apartner of John D. Rockefeller; the duo had earned fifty cents per barrel forevery barrel of oil that was shipped by rail. This enormous kickback had beenset up as a rebate for their own crude and as a tariff for every competitor.With their vast holdings and Rockefeller’s ferretlike spirit, they had simplybullied the railroads into this contractual arrangement.14Known as a haughty fellow and “kin of God,” Payne never did take to John D., buthe did maintain the partnership. He had a residence in New York and was a friendand financial benefactor of Stanford White, whom he commissioned to purchase artfor him while in Europe and design his nephew’s mansion, Payne Whitney, in thecity.White, who was in an awful fix, nearly three-quarters of a million dollars indebt, mainly from the Northern Pacific fiasco, informed Tesla that Payne hadprovided him with notable assistance to help ease his burden. White was alsodisheartened because his girlfriend, young Evelyn Nesbit, had now begun dating aderanged multimillionaire from Pittsburgh, Harry Thaw. “I have heard storiesfrom the Floradora girls that he whipped one of them in bed with a cat-of-ninetails.”Ironically, White held no ill feelings for Morgan, even though the financier wasdirectly responsible for the market crash. At the close of 1903, White and hiswife, Bessie, joined the commodore on the Corsair to watch the yacht races, andWhite’s partner, Charles McKim, was still busily involved in constructing theMorgan Library. One wonders how Morgan might have felt when he boated up toNewport or Bar Harbor and looked to the eastern horizon and saw Tesla’smushroom-shaped behemoth. “Do you think he will ever reconsider?” the inventorinquired.“With Morgan, anything is possible” came the architect’s reply. “However, Ithink at this stage, Colonel Payne is a safer bet.”A Yankee cornerstone, the good colonel was connected to the highest echelons ingovernment. Through the marriage of his sister, he was linked to William C.Whitney, secretary of the navy, and also to John Hay, secretary of state;Payne’s father, Henry Payne, was a well-known senator, often discussed as apotential candidate for president of the United States.15 This was not a lead totake lightly.As a favor to this Ohio nobleman, Tesla opened up his storehouse to theCleveland Leader and conferred with Kerr, Page & Cooper for a way to create alegal document which would delineate the scope and fundamental might of hisarsenal of patents. In a comprehensive article entitled “Harnessing theLightning,” journalist Alfred Cowles noted that the inventor’s prognostications“were so startling that had they come from another source, one would naturallyconsider them the vagaries of a wandering mind. If he can accomplish what he isundertaking, his fame will, in future centuries, overshadow the greatest namesof the past.”Echoing sentiments Tesla had expressed during their interview, Cowles concluded,“Real inventions are only possible when the mental creation of the inventorproves to be in harmony with natural law; and such inventions, when they arenecessities, are in themselves a part of the evolutionary process, wheredevelopment is an adjustment to environment.”16> How all one whole harmonious weaves,> Each in the other works and lives!> See heavenly powers ascending and descending> The golden buckets, one long line extending.Tesla presented to Barnes and Payne a comprehensive lawyers’ brief delineatingessentially every feature of his master plan. Included were patentspecifications and plans for “distributing electric energy without wires fortelegraphic, telephonic and industrial purposes,” for storing the energy,localizing transmissions, insuring non-interferability, and for creatingseparate channels. Also included was Tesla’s work in telautomatics, means forcreating high frequencies, his oscillators, and “a method for insulatingelectric mains by refrigeration to very low temperature…By [this] means, powercan be conveyed to great distances cheaply, and literally, without any loss.”The plan also suggested the “perfect solution of the problem of undergrounddistribution in cities and populated districts.” Thus, the ultimate scheme wouldinvolve both wireless and conventional means of distributing the electricalenergy. Analyzing the viability of each of the twenty-three patents, lawyersKerr, Page & Cooper concluded, “We know of nothing to anticipate the claims andare of the opinion that they are valid.”17The report was also circulated to other major players, including Fortune Ryanand Pierpont Morgan. “I SWEAR,” Tesla wrote to Scherff, “if I ever get out ofthis hole, nobody will catch me without cash!” Simultaneously, he haggled withthe coal company to maintain fuel deliveries and with the telephone company tokeep his line at Wardenclyffe open. “I am now sure that the two lamps asproposed will be a perfect success and you know that after that I can draw onthe U.S. Treasury.”18 Problems with the lamp persisted, however, and it wouldnever be marketed under Tesla’s name.> OCTOBER 28, 1958> WESTINGHOUSE ANNOUNCEMENT> > Lamp Division> > The Westinghouse Corporation [is pleased to] announce [that] a “flat light> bulb” which has no filaments, which produces no heat, which is glare free, and> which will burn night and day for a year for less than a penny…has been> introduced…This marks the first time the public has been able to purchase an> electroluminescent lamp as a light source for the home.19As the Colonel Payne deal fell through, Tesla wrote to Morgan from Wardenclyffe,“I hope the unfortunate misunderstanding, the cause of which I have been vainlytrying to discover will be removed…and that you will recognize that my work isthe kind that passes into history and worthy of your support.”20Throughout the spring and summer, Tesla would visit the plant again and againfor strength and confirmation. In June he instructed Scherff to make sure thatthe lawn was manicured at Wardenclyffe, as he was arriving with anotherpotential investor.21 Yet his resolve was beginning to waver; everywhere heturned, he met rejection. He became convinced that his success rested onchanging the mind of a single man. In September a dispatch was hand-delivered toMorgan “assur[ing] contracts for several such plants in England and Russia,”22but no response came from the financier.During the height of autumn, Morgan conferred with the archbishop ofCanterbury.23 Taking this as a mystical sign in the aid of his quest, theengineering cognoscente authored, on October 13, his favorite day of the month,a thirteen-point letter spelling out the entire chain of events to theomnipotent capitalist. The letter began with a discussion of his patentapplications, the development of their liaison, and Tesla’s decision to changethe nature of the agreement because of Marconi’s piracy. Simply transmittingmere Morse-coded messages was beneath consideration for the pompousconceptualist. As he had aligned himself with the greatest economic force on theplanet, this confirmed the necessity of engaging in the larger endeavor.> Your participation called for a careful revision of my plans…Perhaps you have> never fully appreciated the sense of this obligation…> > Once I lost your support I could not because of your personality and character> of our agreement interest anybody else, at least not for several years, until> the…commercial value of my patents [was] recognized.> > [By increasing the size of the transmitter] until…the plant can transmit> signals to the uttermost confines of the Earth, its earning power becomes, so> to speak, unlimited…but it will cost scarcely twice as much [e.g.,> $300,000]…[This] offered possibilities for a business on a large, dignified> scale, commensurate with your position in life and mine as pioneer in this> art, who has originated all its essential principles…> > You had told me from the outset that I should not ask for more, but the work> was of such transcending importance…that I undertook to explain to you the> state of things on your first return from abroad.

This was most unfortunate…> > The audacious schemers who have dared to fool the crowned heads of Europe, the> President of the United States, and even His Holiness the Pope have> discredited the art by incompetent attempts [far more than they ever could by> success] and spoiled the public by false promises which it cannot distinguish> from legitimate right…and skill…> > I know you must be sceptical [sic] about getting hundredfold returns, but if> you will help me to the end, you will soon see that my judgement is true…I> have expended about $250,000 in all and a much smaller sum separates me from a> giant triumph…$75,000 would certainly complete the plant…This letter (greatly condensed here) was a fair and accurate assessment of whathad occurred and why. Clearly, it was written by a lucid savant, one who hadproved himself in industry on many other occasions and one who was on the vergeof altering the course of civilization in a dramatic and revolutionary way.Tesla was operating at the level of soul consciousness, and so he removed alldefenses and revealed the very depths of his being with the following salutationand sacred vow:> Since a year, Mr. Morgan, there has been hardly a night when my pillow is not> bathed in tears, but you must not think me a weak man for that.

I tell you I shall return your money a hundredfold.26The letter was followed up with testimonials to his abilities as espoused byvarious leaders in his field. It also explained in detail how this operationadvanced the work performed at Colorado Springs. On December 16, Tesla sent anultimatum. He requested either $100,000 to complete the plant or $50,000 “tofinish the indispensable parts, make everything perfectly fireproof…and take outinsurance,” or “if you do not want to do this, only one thing remains. Yourelease me of all obligations, give me back my assignments and consider the sumyou have invested as a generous contribution leaving it all to my integrity andability to work out the best results for you and for myself.” Tesla suggestedthat he could go on a lecture tour to raise the funds; then it would take him“not more…than a week to get a few million in Wall Street.”27On the seventeenth, Morgan wrote back:> I am not willing to advance you any more money as I have frequently told you.> As to your third proposition, I am not prepared to accept this either.

Tesla29To demonstrate goodwill, Tesla enclosed a royalty check on one of his patentsand an advance copy of his theoretical masterpiece “The Transmission ofElectrical Energy Without Wires as a Means of Furthering Peace.” A fortnightlater, on January 6, 1905, Morgan sent the 49 percent balance legally due theinventor.THE WARDENCLYFFE PEACE PLANPublished in Electrical World & Engineer, Tesla’s treatise ran nearly sixthousand words. It began with a discussion of how “philanthropy” and “thepractical utilization of electrical vibrations,” that is, a mass communicationsystem, might bring about “universal peace.” In defining and analyzing thistheme, Tesla noted that it may come about suddenly, as the result of a slowaccumulation of past efforts through history. “We must think cosmically…The raceenmities and prejudices are decidedly waning…So far, however, universal harmonyhas been attained only in a single sphere of international relationship: that isthe postal service…“A few strong countries [might] scare all the weaker ones into peace,” Teslasuggests, “[but] to conquer by sheer force is becoming harder and harder everyday.” Just as cruise missiles, CNN, and the world news organizations havealtered markedly the way war is conducted today, by having machines fightinstead of human (Nintendo war), and by usurping the old conventional chains ofcommand, Tesla prophesied similarly in 1905: “Had only a few [of my]‘telautomatic’ torpedoes been constructed and adopted by our navy [instead ofrejected], the mere moral influence of this would have been powerfully and mostbeneficially felt in the present Eastern [Russian-Japanese] complication. Not tospeak of the advantages which might have been secured through the direct andinstantaneous transmission of messages to distant colonies and scenes of thepresent barbarous conflicts.”His treatise went on to describe a new “quasi-intelligent” missile guidancesystem that he was developing which would have a “greater range and unerringprecision,” but also that “misunderstanding” is the basis of wars. Speaking toMorgan in veiled terms that help to explain why so many of Tesla’s mostimportant theoretical writings can be found in the pages of the New York Times,the Herald Tribune, the Sun and the World, the inventor wrote: “Mutualunderstanding would be immensely facilitated by use of one universal tongue…Nextto speech we must consider permanent records of all kinds…Here the newspapersplay by far the most important part…Disregarding the force of electricalinvention, that of journalism is the greatest in urging us to peace…That whichis most desirable…in the establishment of universal peaceful relations is—thecomplete ANNIHILATION OF DISTANCE. To achieve this wonder, electricity is theone and only means.”If Morgan were to fund him, universal peace would ensue. This was quite aresponsibility he placed on his benefactor’s shoulders. Continuing for five morefact-filled pages, Tesla described in vivid detail his entire world telegraphyoperation, precisely how it worked, and what it attempted to accomplish.Referring to the thunderstorm he had witnessed that summer night in the ColoradoRockies and his discovery of stationary waves, Tesla concludes: “On thatunforgettable day, the dark God of Thunder mercifully showed me in his vast,awe-sounding laboratory [the geomagnetic pulse]. I thought then that it wouldtake a year to establish commercially my wireless girdle around the world. Alas!my first “world telegraphy” plant is not yet completed, its construction hasprogressed but slowly during the past two years. And this machine I am buildingis but a plaything, an oscillator of a maximum activity of only ten millionhorsepower, just enough to throw this planet into feeble tremors, by sign andword—to telegraph and to telephone.”Although trying to assure Morgan that Wardenclyffe would not usurp the powercompanies, Tesla had to go on: “When shall I see completed that first powerplant, that big oscillator which I am designing?…Which will deliver energy atthe rate of one thousand million horse-power—one hundred Falls of Niagaracombined in one, striking the universe with blows—blows that will wake fromtheir slumber the sleeping electricians, if there be any, on Venus or Mars!…Itis not a dream, it is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering, onlyexpensive—blind, faint-hearted world!”Had he shown restraint, would this treatise have served its purpose,transforming the capitalist into the philanthropist? Probably not. In any event,Tesla further injured his position by ending the essay with a final stab:“Perhaps it is better in this present world of ours that a revolutionary idea orinvention instead of being helped and patted, be hampered and illtreated in itsadolescence—…by selfish interest, pedantry, stupidity and ignorance; that it beattacked and stifled; that it pass through bitter trials and tribulations,through the heartless strife of commercial exis[t]ence. So do we get our light.So all that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combatted,suppressed—only to emerge all the more powerfully, all the more triumphantlyfrom the struggle.”30> February 17, 1905> > Dear Mr. Morgan,> > Let me tell you once more.

Warden’s lawyer pressed for a mortgage payment,and one of Tesla’s previous workers, a Mr. Clark, was suing for past wages. Whensome of the bad news arrived at his Waldorf suite, the inventor “tore the lettersufficiently to prevent any undesirable person [from] read[ing] the terribleopen secret of Wardenclyffe.” Tesla tried to maintain a balance by perseveringwith the development of his oscillators and other inventions, such as atransformer, a condenser, and a steam turbine, but these operations werelong-range projects that would not provide immediate payoffs on the order neededto reopen the wireless operation. “The obstacles in my way,” Tesla wroteScherff, “are a regular hydra. Just as soon as I chop off a head, two new onesgrow.”32Tesla began to write exclusively in pencil during this period, his writingbecoming less distinct, lacking the boldness and clarity which had characterizedit at earlier periods. Beginning to feel run-down on a more regular basis, Teslalikened his task to that of a weight lifter. “Every ounce counts now,” he toldhis manager.> March 10, 1905> > My dear Luka,> > Won’t go to dinner [with you]. I am hard at work to get [Mrs. Filipov] that> fine automobile.33At the end of March, Tesla was “thunder struck at the Waldorf” when Warden’slawyer stormed the premises demanding immediate payment. The raising of even oneof Mr. Boldt’s eyebrows was enough to unsettle the struggling entrepreneur.“Hope to get out [to Wardenclyffe] Sunday.” Tesla wrote Scherff. “Need itbadly.”34Tesla set to work with his lawyers in April, finalizing patent applications forEngland, France, and Italy. But his inability to adequately compensate hisworkers on Long Island was creating a “[de]moral[izing] effect at Wardenclyffe.Perhaps we are nearing a revolution down there?” he inquired of Scherff.“Disappointments…and dangers…troubles and troubles again” continued to plaguehim.35 He was beginning to crumble.> May 1, 1905> > My dear Tesla:> > I know it will please you to hear of the great happiness that has come to me.> Miss Grizelda Houston Hull…has consented to become my wife and the wedding has> been [planned] for May 25th…Do you know, my dear Tesla, you are the very first> person, outside of my family that I thought of and which the ceremonies will> be very simple, I wish to feel you present in standing close to me on this> occasion so full of incoming in my life.> > Indeed, I could not feel the occasion complete without you.> > Sincerely yours,> Richmond Pearson Hobson36The joyful occasion was a needed respite, Tesla “chatting” with Hobson’smother-in-law, hiding his worries, and characteristically teasing his friend.“Hobson,” he declared, “now that you are married, your career is over.”37 This,of course, was far from the truth, as rumors had long been circulating about thepossibility of grooming the charismatic lieutenant for the presidency.“I must do something for our dear Mr. Tesla,” Katharine told Robert on the ridehome.“What could you do that he hasn’t?”“Appeal to the king,” she answered wistfully. Upon their arrival home, Katharineran to the house to hide her tears.While Morgan was away in Europe for his summer sojourn, Tesla met with JacobSchiff, a man in the midst of lending the Japanese large sums of money in theirwar against the Russians. “S. said that perhaps he may take it himself,” Teslawrote hopefully to Scherff. “I believe that he will be a valuable man to me.”38In August, Morgan returned. Tesla sent Scherff to hand-deliver his newest listof patents granted, which the octopus grabbed in his tentacles and tossed intothe wastebasket.> November 11, 1905> > Dear Mr. Scherff,> > Thirteen seems to be my lucky number.

Pierpont Morgan40Christmas was approaching, and Tesla had apparently struck a deal with anotherof the superrich. Frick, we remember, had earned upward of $60 million in 1901,when U.S. Steel was created. Ryan and Schiff were also involved in this newpotential syndicate. Tesla wrote Morgan to thank him for allowing the liaison tocome about. “You and Mr. Frick can take whatever you like. [I shall besatisfied] with a very small interest,” Tesla wrote in a first draft. “Iunderstand your attitude perfectly. You adhere strictly to principles. Never inmy life have I [met] a man who even in a small [way can approach] the state [asdescribed] by Goethe.”41Yet again Tesla reviewed their relationship, his decision to change thecontract, and his ultimate wish to transmit power for industrial purposes. Why?Morgan sidestepped a meeting with Frick in December. An ill wind was blowing.Tesla began to crumble, his handwriting now barely legible, written as a meager,wispy stroke in pencil.> December 24, 1905> > Dear Tesla,> > I have been sorry to hear of your recent illness—well concealed from your> friends and the public—and I am also now very glad to hear of your recovery.> Please stay well and strong.> > Yours sincerely,> T.

Completely on her own, Mrs. RobertUnderwood Johnson called a hansom. “Twenty-three Wall Street,” she said boldly.Morgan would not see her.44> February 2, 1906> > Dear Mr. Morgan,> > Please see Mr. Frick…He is going to call on you. Time is flying.45A fortnight later, Tesla wrote again, pleading with Morgan to allow theformation of “a reasonable foundation upon which I am justly entitled.” Teslarequested that Morgan agree to take one-third of the enterprise, therebyreducing his share by approximately 20 percent. “Please do not spoil the letterby unnecessary reference to your unwillingness of furnishing more money. Thewhole town knows it.”46Morgan did his best to scuttle the deal, and with it Tesla fell. His body shookviolently, and his eyes began to bulge out of his head. Forgetting to shave oreven shower, the ailing engineer grabbed the first train to Shoreham and ranfrom the station to his precious tower, just a few hundred yards away. Clutchingthe girders for support as he climbed, the pulverized sorcerer ascended fifteenstories to the apex and looked out at the flat land which lay undisturbed formiles in every direction.> April 10, 1906> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > I have received your letter and am very glad to know that you are vanquishing> your illness.

It was less than a month after the great SanFrancisco earthquake, but the jolt served to reawaken a new reserve of energy.Working with Scherff and a few men at the plant, Tesla continued development ofhis condenser and steam turbine which he was planning on placing inside atorpedo.Concerned about the stability of the buildings America was constructing,Stanford White wrote the city of San Francisco, telling them to pass “stringentlaws…The hot riveted steel building stood the shock wonderfully,” heconcluded.48White, like Tesla, was a victim of financial misfortune and he began drinkingheavily. Only fifty-four, his health was in decline, and he was suffering fromtuberculosis. In February the architect had planned to auction off $300,000worth of his tapestries, sculptures, and paintings in order to reduce his debtby half, but a fire wiped out the uninsured holdings just two weeks prior to thesale.Harry Thaw, having married Evelyn Nesbit, was having White followed day andnight. On June 25, 1906, with Evelyn present, Thaw snaked his way down the aisleof the Roof Garden restaurant at Madison Square Garden, pearl-handled pistol inhand. While entertainer Harry Short sang “I Could Love a Thousand Girls,” Thawspotted and shot the “Beast” between the eyes. Stanford White, designer ofMadison Square Garden, the agriculture building at the Chicago World’s Fair, theNiagara Falls power plant, the Capitol in Providence, the Washington Arch in NewYork, Rosecliffe and the Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, the Casino inNarragansett, the Boston train station, the Players’ Club, numerous churches andother mansions, the new extension on the White House, and Wardenclyffe was dead.Few attended White’s funeral for he had been accused of raping asixteen-year-old girl. But Tesla came.49 The dream vanquished; the Gilded Ageended.Throughout the year, Tesla’s handwriting began to unglue, and by August itcompletely disintegrated, supporting the hypothesis that he suffered a nervouscollapse at that time.50 Entering his own private hell, the inventor was forcedto endure an emotional enervation which caused a corresponding dysfunctionalshift in his personality. Self-alienation took hold, bitterness and displacedanger became manifest as the quirks in his nature became more pronounced.Letters even to his closest friends would be signed N. Tesla, not Nikola. Theuntimely death of William Rankine at the age of forty-seven in September wasanother nail in the coffin of his dreams.In a barely legible letter dated October 15, 1906, the last in this incredibleseries to Morgan, Tesla informed the Wall Street monarch that Messieurs Ryan,Schiff, and Frick were all willing to enter the partnership.> Every opportunity is there…I have high regards for you as a big and honorable> man…There is greater power in the leaf of a flower then in the paw of a bear.> That is as much as I’ll ever say…You are reputed as a builder of properties,> but if you prefer in this instance to chop down poles…go ahead.51> > > > FAUST: Gnash not so thy greedy teeth against me!—Great and glorious spirit,> thou that deniest to appear to me, who knowest my heart and soul, why yoke me> to this shame-fellow, who feeds on mischief and feasts on ruin?> > MEPHISTOPHELES: Who was it that plunged her into ruin?

His hairdisheveled, his clothes scattered about, the former man of the hour was going tohave to let the maid in soon. What would she say about the drapes he had placedover the mirrors? And then there was the tower. He had to go back there to sealup the property. Would he have the strength to make the journey?His appetite all but gone, Tesla hadn’t seen his friends for months. He manageda letter to Katharine as he rang room service to send up breakfast. “I’m ever inso much greater trouble,” he scratched out on his letterhead.3 But he wouldallow no one to truly know the hell he had entered. No sunlight must enter hisroom. He sat in the shadows and petted a wounded pigeon he had found flounderingby the New York Public Library. If Boldt ever knew, the bird would have to besmuggled back out.The withered man reached over to the envelope addressed to him in a femininehand. Carefully he removed the letter and theater ticket. Marguerite Merringtonhad invited him to her new play Love Finds a Way. He stared at the title andbroke down once again into uncontrollable sobs.4Reconciling the torment, Tesla eased himself back into the social net as 1907commenced. As part of his therapy, the recluse would surreptitiously board amoonlight train to Wardenclyffe. There, in the wizard’s chambers, the Balkangenie would hook up high-frequency apparatus to his skull and thereby impressmacabre waves of soothing electrical energy through his brain. “I have passed[150,000 volts]…through my head,” Tesla told the New York Times, “and did notlose consciousness, but I invariably fell into a lethargic sleep some timeafter.”In May, Tesla was inducted as a member of the New York Academy of Sciences.6Slowly, he began to see once again that perhaps his grand plan could beresurrected. To raise the capital to keep his ship afloat, the inventor took outa series of mortgages, subdividing the enterprise into a string of hypotheticalparcels. In the spring of 1904 he had borrowed $5,000 from Thomas G. Sherman, alaw partner of Stanford White’s brother-in-law, and in the winter of 1906 heobtained $3,500 from Edmund Stallo, a son-in-law of one of Rockefeller’sStandard Oil partners; but those funds had long disappeared. Having dodged theWaldorf management for nearly three years, he took out another mortgage for anadditional $5,000 against the rent he owed with the proprietor, George Boldt.7And thus began a fresh plan for continuing to live in the lap of luxury withoutlaying out another dime.Boldt had done exceptionally well for himself. Having hobnobbed with themegarich for many years, the Waldorf manager had been able to take advantage ofa number of inside opportunities. By 1907, a millionaire in his own right, hehad expanded his base to become a banker, orchestrating the creation of theLincoln Trust Company, which was located across the street from Madison SquareGarden.8Everyone except Tesla seemed to be flourishing. Morgan, through Jacob Schiff,had finally iced his deal with the Guggenheims to form the “Alaska Syndicate,”an enormous corporation which had been set up to exploit a copper find in theinviolable northern wilderness. Whereas the Guggenheim mountain in Utahcontained only 2-3 percent ore, this lode, according to John Hays Hammond’sreport, was 75 percent pure copper! A site of incalculable wealth, it would takea fleet of steamships, a thousandman crew, and an up-front capital investment of$25 million to construct a railroad just to reach the find.But copper was not all the “Morganheims” had their eye on. They also beganpurchasing coal and iron reserves and hundreds of thousands of acres offorestland. “Thus the press, the few environmentalists active at the time, and asignificant portion of the American people began to vigorously oppose theGuggenmorganization of Alaska.”9With the growing need for copper wire came also a demand for insulation. Seizingthe opportunity, Thomas Fortune Ryan and Bernard Baruch went to Europe to sign acontract with the king of Belgium (the former Prince Albert, an acquaintance ofTesla’s). Their plan was to take over the rubber industry in the African Congo.The financiers negotiated an even split, with the king allocating 25 percent forhis country and retaining 25 percent for himself. As Baruch returned to WallStreet to handle marketing, Ryan traveled to Africa to oversee the product’smanufacture. Naturally, the tire companies were just as interested as theelectrical concerns.Once it was realized that Tesla’s plans to do away with transmission lines hadbeen abolished, it seemed as if there began a feeding frenzy on copper stocks,as this market was now assured a continually increasing demand.PANIC OF 1907The first signs of economic distress was heralded in August, when John D.Rockefeller of Standard Oil was fined the staggering sum of $29 million forprice gouging and illegal tariffs. Suddenly, Wall Street became edgy. InOctober, F. Augustus Heinze, a well-known speculator and enemy of the Guggenheimsyndicate, began dumping large blocks of United Copper onto the market. Heinzemiscalculated in his attempts to buy back the stock at a much lower price, andhis shifty scheming resulted in a drop in the market and a run on his bank, theMercantile Trust Company. Due to Heinze’s links to other financial institutions,the hysteria spread, and the Panic of 1907 began. Depositors emptied out everybank they could get into.J. Pierpont Morgan called an emergency conference of all the bank and trustpresidents, gathering them together in his newly constructed library in anall-night vigil. Sitting among his tapestries, original manuscripts, paintings,and jewels, the Wall Street monarch did his best to orchestrate a bailout ofthose institutions that were salvageable. Some, however, were beyond repair, andthe stronger banks would go only so far in dipping into their reserves. CharlesBarney, director of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, and father of “two awfullypretty sisters,” pleaded for assistance, but he was rebuked. Barney went homeand put a pistol to his head. This act produced a wave of suicides, particularlyamong the Knickerbocker’s eighteen thousand depositors. With Henry Clay Frickacting as liaison, President Theodore Roosevelt would transfer $25 million intoMorgan’s control. Although this figure matched the pledge of the strongerinstitutions, the new influx could only stretch so far. Boldt’s bank, theLincoln Trust, along with the Knickerbocker, the Mercantile, and half a dozenothers, had gone under by the end of the week.10 Now Tesla’s chances ofresurrecting his own enterprise became even more remote.“These are simply awful times,” Tesla told Scherff. “I cannot understand at allhow Americans who are so daring and reckless in other respects can get scared tosuch a degree. My ship propulsion scheme is really great, and I feel sure thatit will pull me out of the hole. Just how, I do not see as yet because it seemsalmost impossible to [amass] any money at all.”“We’re still waiting to hear from the International Mercantile Marine Company,”Scherff said.“Be patient, my man. They are certainly interested, but make conditions which Iam unable to accept for the present. If I had just a little capital I would notworry about finishing my place.”“What about Astor?”“He told me over the phone, that he would see me as soon as possible, but up topresent, nothing has materialized. I know now, that if I am to get capital, Ican only get it from some fellow who has not less than a hundred million.”“Then, Mr. Tesla, let’s hope for the best.”11“Dulled by [his] own suffering,”12 Tesla began edging himself out of hisdepression by producing a number of acerbic essays for the electrical journalsand local newspapers. Covering a wide range of topics, the inventor sought tovindicate himself and thereby try and make sense out of an absurdly ironicsituation. Simultaneously, he sought to explain the Wardenclyffe vision yetagain in the vain hope that some financier with a transcendent vision would cometo his rescue. He was searching for a hero, not only for selfish desires but, inhis eyes, for the future of the planet.Under the guise of commenting on Commodore Perry’s exploration of the NorthPole, Tesla explained in detail the modus operandi of his world wirelessscheme.13 For Harvard Illustrated, he discussed Lowell’s Martian discoveries andthe way to signal the nearby planet;” for the World and English Mechanic & Worldof Science, he described how a tidal wave could be created by using highexplosives to set the entire earth in oscillation and discussed how this wall ofwater could be harnessed to “engulf” an advancing enemy;15 and for the New YorkSun and New York Times he drafted a flurry of letters to the editor on suchtopics as his dirigible wireless torpedo,16 the transmission of voice by meansof wireless, the “narcotic influence of certain periodic currents” whentransmitted through the body for therapeutic reasons, the inefficiency ofMarconi’s system, and the piracy of his oscillators by Marconi and anotherwireless inventor Valdemar Poulsen. Tesla also declared that the telephone wasinvented by Philip Reis before Bell and the incandescent lamp by King and J. W.Starr before Edison.17Unlike Bell and Edison, Tesla wrote, “I had to cut the path myself, and my handsare still sore.” After reviewing his bitter battle for vindication as the trueauthor of the AC polyphase system against such “feeble men” as ProfessorFerraris, the wizard went on to discuss his seminal work in wireless telegraphy.“It will never be possible to transmit electrical energy economically throughthis [planet] and its environment except by essentially the same means andmethods which I have discovered,” he declared, “and the system is so perfect nowthat it admits of but little improvement…Would you mind telling a reason whythis advance should not stand worthily beside the discoveries of Copernicus?”18This was a new Tesla—resentful, indignant, defiant, petulant. He was thediscoverer of the AC polyphase system, the induction motor, fluorescent lights,mechanical and electrical oscillators, a novel steam propulsion system, wirelesstransmission of intelligence, light, and power, remote control, andinterplanetary communication. He was an original discoverer, whereas Bell andEdison had merely modified the works of others. How dare the world deny him hisdue?Tesla’s inventions were even at the heart of the new electric subway systemwhich had just opened its doors beneath the thriving metropolis. Flooding,however, was a continual problem which marred this newest Tesla spin-off. Thepublic had to be warned lest water cause corrosion of vital components, therebyincreasing the risk of causing an explosion, and so another article advised theauthorities on ways to cure the problem.After one of his biweekly trips to his esteemed tonsorial artist for the warmcompresses on his face and vigorous head massage to stimulate brain cells,19Tesla picked up his walking cane and strolled out in his green suede high-topsto Forty-second Street, to the entranceway of the freshly tiled Interboroughcatacombs. He was looking for new office space. Descending the staircase, thecreator was overtaken with a pompous sense of pride as he stood by the tracks toawait the next train. It was an almost magical experience for him to drop downin one part of the city, only to pop up majestically in another spot a fewminutes later.While waiting at a stop one ordinary day in 1907, he was approached by a lad andasked if he were the great Nikola Tesla. Catching a gleam in the inquirer’s eye,the inventor answered in the affirmative.“I have many questions to ask you,” the youngster said as Tesla moved forward tostep aboard the train.“Well, then, come on,” Tesla responded, unable to understand why the boyhesitated.“I do not have enough money for the fare” was the embarrassed reply.“Oh, is that all,” the electronic savant chuckled as he tossed the youngster therequired sum. “What’s your name?”“O’Neill, sir, Jack O’Neill. I’m applying for a job as a page for the New YorkPublic Library.”“Good. We can meet there and you can help me research the history of somepatents I am investigating.”O’Neill, who also had a keen interest in psychic phenomena, would go on a decadelater to become a science reporter for the Long Island paper, the Nassau DailyReview Star. Eventually he took a position at the Herald Tribune, where he wonthe Pulitzer Prize before penning Prodigal Genius.20In June came yet another legal suit, again from Warden, only this time from hisheirs, as he had passed away. The amount was for $1,080, for money owed on anoption Tesla had on four hundred acres adjacent to the two hundred hecontrolled.“This is an old case which has been dragging in the courts for years,” Teslatold the Sun reporter. “I [had] intended to use this land for an agriculturalexperiment in fertilizing soil by means of electricity. I thought that by theuse of certain electrical principles [in producing nitrogen], the soil could beincreased very much, [and thus I had] agreed to take a certain option. Butsubsequently [I] discovered that the person who entered into the agreement hadno right to make such a disposition…I told him the option was off…[but] theheirs of the owner had simply pressed the claim, and it is very likely that itwill have to be paid.”21VTOL’S: A HISTORY OF VERTICAL & TAKE-OFF LANDING AIRCRAFT> June 8, 1908> > My dear Colonel,> > I am now ready to take an order from you for a self-propelled flying machine,> either of the lighter or heavier-than-air type.> > Yours sincerely,> Nikola Tesla22Astor was particularly interested in flying machines, but as would become hishabit, Tesla would be working at cross-purposes. He wanted the good colonel tofund this work in aeronautics, but, in actuality, his ultimate goal was to earnenough money so that he could return to Long Island and reopen his worldtelegraphy plant. Thus, any potential profits were always threatened by thegreater plan. This problem would continue to encumber any possible deal,especially with someone like Astor, who knew full well the inventor’s primaryintentions.One of Tesla’s most confounding prognostications came at the onset of 1908.Having finally located a new work space at 165 Broadway, Tesla felt that he wasgetting back on track. Shortly after he moved in, he received an invitation tospeak at a Waldorf-Astoria dinner in honor of himself and Rear Adm. CharlesSigsbee. “Th[is] coming year will dispel [one]…error which has greatly retardedaerial navigation,” Tesla prophesied. “The aeronaut will soon satisfy himselfthat an aeroplane…is altogether too heavy to soar, and that such a machine,while it will have some use, can never fly as fast as a dirigible balloon…Instrong contrast with these unnecessarily hazardous trials are the serious anddignified efforts of Count Zeppelin, who is building a real flying machine, safeand reliable, to carry a dozen men and provisions, and with a speed far inexcess of those obtained with aeroplanes.”23Assuming that the viscosity of the atmosphere exceeded that of water, Tesla hadcalculated that an airplane could never fly much faster than “an aqueous craft.”The inventor further reasoned that for highest velocities “the propeller isdoomed.” Not only was its rotational speed restrictive, it was also subject toeasy breakage. The prop plane, according to calculations, would have to bereplaced by “a reactive jet.”24In the short run, that is, for the next thirty years, the airship was thepreferred method of passenger travel.> BERLIN, May 30 [1908].

In expectation of the event…the Emperor and> Empress…and hundreds of thousands gathered there.25It would be two decades before Lindbergh would capture the imagination of thepublic by flying solo in a propeller-driven airplane across the high seas, butairships were already close to accomplishing that feat. In 1911, Joseph Bruckerformed the Transatlantic Airship Expedition, but he was beaten in the quest bythe British air force, which succeeded in crossing the Atlantic eight yearslater.26 During World War I, the zeppelin ran frequent bombing missions fromBerlin to London; Robert Underwood Johnson flew with fifty other passengers in asimilar “leviathan” over Rome just two years later, in 1919.27 However, by thelate 1920s this infamous legacy was all but forgotten, as these great airshipswere flying regularly across the Atlantic from Europe to both North and SouthAmerica, and Germany was enjoying a reputation as the new leader in futuristictechnology.One curious and unfortunate footnote to history was the senseless choice to fillthose blimps with hydrogen, a highly explosive gas, instead of nonflammablehelium. Had engineers insisted on the much safer medium by heeding Tesla’s 1915warning, the great Hindenburg disaster of 1937 would never have taken place, andthe use of zeppelins would probably have continued for many more years to come.The problem stemmed all the way back to the late 1700s, when Jacques Charles, aFrench scientist, discovered that hydrogen was fourteen times lighter than airand filled a balloon with it. Monsieur Charles, like Count Zeppelin of Tesla’stime, gained great notoriety by traveling in his balloon fifteen or twenty milesat a stretch.Today airships create stable platforms for TV sports cameras, advertisers usethem because of their unique ability to generate “brand-name recognition,” andthe military likes them because they offer singular advantages over thehelicopter. They can be used for low-flying rescue missions without creatinghazardous turbulence; they can be used to detect the submarine launching ofcruise missiles by positioning themselves in a single area for hours or days onend; and they are extremely difficult to locate by ground surveillance. “Whydon’t they show on radar?” a recent Popular Mechanics article asks. “Because theSkyship’s gondola is made of Kevlar, the envelope is of polyurethane fiber andit’s filled with helium.They all have little or no radar register…The next-generation [air] ships wouldsip fuel. And they would stay operational for months at a time. As these aredeveloped for military use, it is not too farfetched to predict that airships ofthe [21st century] may even be used for trans-Atlantic passenger service.”28Tesla reveals in his Waldorf-Astoria speech his prophecy of the inevitabledevelopment of the jet plane, which would be about as close as he would come toexplaining his highly novel and still obscure invention of an airplane thatoperated much like today’s VTOL “vectored thrust” aircraft. Tesla had playedwith a number of airship designs since his college days. One of his models,drawn up in 1894, was a traditionally shaped hot air balloon. Inspired by thosehe had seen at the World Fairs in Paris and Chicago, this dirigible received itscontinuing supply of heat from a gigantic induction coil that was placed highabove the gondola, in the center of the hot-air container.29The more recent model, which resembled a gigantic teardrop, took intoconsideration aerodynamic principles uncovered by such researchers as Leonardoda Vinci, Count von Zeppelin and Lawrence Hargrave, an Australian who, in 1890,fashioned rubber-band powered prop planes which traveled through the air overdistances exceeding a hundred yards. This design was schematically prepared inthe shape of a conventional airfoil by one of Tesla’s draftsmen in 1908.30> My airship will have neither gas bag, wings nor propellers…You might see it on> the ground and you would never guess that it was a flying machine.

Its lifting power will not depend on any such delicate> devices as the bird has to employ, but upon positive mechanical> action…[Stability will be achieved] through gyroscopic action of my engine…It> is the child of my dreams, the product of years of intense and painful toil> and research.31Tesla’s vehicle had the “reactive jet” placed at its “leading edge,” or bulkyend, and the fifty steering escape valves placed at the opposite, “trailingedge,” or tapered end. If fashioned as a lighter-than-air dirigible, the shipwould have been modeled, in part, after the work of Henri Giffard, a Frenchmanwho invented the first dirigible in 1852, as well as Count von Zeppelin, theinventor who had been the first to construct a successful prototype with a rigidmetal framework “within the bag.”32 Zeppelin was also one of the first to takeinto consideration wind resistance; his ships could travel at speeds of morethan forty miles per hour.A well-designed airfoil can develop “a lift force many times its drag. Thisallows the wing of an airplane to serve as a thrust amplifier…[If] the thrust isdirected horizontally, a vertical lift force large enough to overcome thevehicle’s weight can be developed.”33Thus, it appears that Tesla’s reactive-jet prototype could have also beenfabricated in a heavier-than-air design. Oliver Chanute, M. Goupil, and O.Lilienthal were other Gay Nineties aeronauts whose patented works Tesla hadstudied. Naturally, he was also influenced by Samuel Langley and the Wrightbrothers, both of whom had produced heavier-than-air models that had actuallyflown.34THE HOVERCRAFTAnother horseshoe crab-shaped VTOL designed by Tesla was called a hovercraft.This vehicle, which resembled a Corvette, placed the powerful turbinehorizontally within its center. Operating much like a great fan, the enginecreated a heavy downdraft which caused the vehicle to rise up and ride along theground on a layer of air.35 This invention, which apparently worked much likethe hovercraft depicted in the original Star Wars film, was the early precursorof the army’s car-sized “aerial jeep,” which “derive[d] its thrust from ductedfans mounted rigidly in the airframe. To fly horizontally, the entire craft[was] tilted slightly [by the leaning motion of the driver].” In 1960,Scientific American could write that “this design is being explored because ofits simplicity and…adaptability for flying at very low altitudes.”36It is doubtful that Tesla ever constructed any of the heavier-than-airhovercrafts, although he may have built a hydrofoil model to skim over theHudson. There is no doubt that he also constructed “lighter-than-air” vesselswhich could be operated by means of remote control.Ideas inherent in Tesla’s hovercraft and paramecium-shaped reactive-jetdirigibles evolved into today’s Harrier fighter plane, a supersonic aircraftconsidered one of the military’s “most potent fighting machines,” and the new,yet-to-be-built Lockheed Martin X-33, which is a lightweight VTOL replacement ofthe space shuttle having a new experimental engine, the plane itself beingshaped like a “flat-flying wing.”37The seeds of this technology can also be traced to the work of “A. F. Zahm, aprominent aeronautical engineer who patented [in 1921] an airplane with a wingthat would deflect the propeller slipstream to provide lift for hovering.”Although Zahm did not actually construct his plane, his concept, which may havebeen influenced by Tesla’s work, evolved into the English Hawker, a Britishfighter developed in the 1960s. This airplane utilized nozzles to deflect aslipstream downward for vertical takeoff or for hovering and horizontally fornormal flight. Utilizing “thrust vectoring,” this apparatus became more workablewith the development of the Pegasus engine, an extremely powerful turbojet foundin the Harrier, which was unyeiled in 1969.38 “From the pilot’s point of view,there is only one extra control in the cockpit: a single [lever] to select thenozzle angle.”39 “AV-8B Harrier: The U.S. Marines’ ground-support jet can takeoff vertically, hover close to a battlefield and let loose missiles, clusterbombs or smart bombs.”40FLYING ON A BEAM OF ENERGYWhether or not Tesla was able to perfect his design for aircraft that operatedwithout any fuel—by deriving energy from wireless transmitters—is unknown. Thisconcept, however, has been adopted by the military. In 1987, the New York Timesand also Newsweek reported large glider planes “powered without fuel.” Theirenergy is derived from microwaves beamed up from ground transmitters to large,flat panels of “rectennae” on each wing’s underbelly. These “special antennas,laced with tiny rectifiers that turn alternating current into direct current,power an electric motor to run the craft’s propeller.”41 This concept is alsoutilized as solar panels onboard spacecraft as well as on solar-poweredautomobiles.> THE FLIVVER PLANE> > Tesla Designs Weird Craft to Fly Up, Down, Sideways> Craft Combines Qualities of Helicopter & Plane> > Detailed descriptions were available yesterday of the helicopter airplane, the> latest creation of Nikola Tesla, inventor, electrical wizard, experimenter and> dreamer.> > It is a tiny combination plane, which, its inventor asserts, will rise and> descend vertically and fly horizontally at great speed, much faster than the> speed of the planes of today. But despite the feats which he credits to his> invention, Tesla says it will sell for something less than $1000.12Although this article was written in 1928, Tesla first applied for patents onhis new “method of aerial transportation” in 1921.43 Nevertheless, designs forpropeller-driven VTOL aircraft dated back even before the turn of the century.One of Tesla’s earliest and most primitive helicopters looked much like awashbasin, with vertical shaft rising from its center. Flailing out, like theskeletons of two umbrellas stacked above one another, were its dual horizontalpropellers. This vehicle evolved into the flivver plane, which took offvertically like a helicopter and then flew like a normal airplane, when thepropeller and craft were rotated 90 degrees into the horizontal position. Theconcepts found in Tesla’s flivver plane can be found in another advancedmilitary VTOL aircraft called the V-22 Osprey. In this design, the body of thevehicle resembles a normal military transport plane. It is the propellers, atthe ends of each wing, which rotate ninety degrees from the helicopter position,for vertical takeoff, into the normal airplane position for forward flight. Usedin the recent war with Iraq (February 1990), this vehicle, like the aerial jeepand VTOL Harrier fighter jet, evolved directly out of Tesla’s designs. AsTesla’s work in aeronautics has never received much publicity, it is quitepossible that the military adopted it in secret.VTOLs can be grouped into four general categories. The aircraft could be tilted,the thrust could be deflected, the propeller or turbojet engine could be tilted,or a dual propulsion system could be utilized. Bell Labs began constructingpropeller-driven VTOLs in the 1940s. Early models included the wing-tiltedXC-142A, developed by Vought, Hiller & Ryan, and the X-19 propeller tiltedcraft, developed by Curtiss & Wright.> THE NEW WEAPONS> > Every service has its favorite new weapon, and the Marine Corp’s favorite is> the V-22 Osprey, an aircraft that can take off like a helicopter and fly like> a plane.

Gilder’s passing was yet anothertangible sign of the end of an important era for the Century.Tesla came over for Christmas dinner, and the discussion drifted to the problemsRobert would now have in boosting a steadily declining circulation. Incompetition with a new crop of plebeian journals, Luka was forced to lower hisstandards by allowing the introduction of such four letter words as “hell” tograce the Century’s pages.Katharine was interested in discussing Sir Oliver Lodge’s recent contention thathe had located a medium that had spoken to “dead members of the Society ofPsychical Research,” but Tesla thought such form of “wireless communication”poppycock. He was more interested in tearing apart Professor Pickering’ssupposition that he could erect a set of mirrors in Texas with $10,000 to signalthe Martians.“The idea that mirrors might be manufactured which will reflect sunlight inparallel beams, for the time being is beyond our range of ability. But there isone method of putting ourselves in touch with other planets,” Tesla said as theeyes of his hosts lit up once again with the idea of Wardenclyffe. Capital, ofcourse, was the problem, so Tesla began to describe his newest moneymakingscheme; it was his latest invention.2Accused of being a visionary and dreamer, the consummate inventor “taxed hispowers of concentration in the calm retirement of the night” to cultivate a wayto bail himself out.3 Often he would leave his Waldorf suite to walk the streetsafter hours and cogitate. His favorite sanctum was the colossal hall at GrandCentral Station.1 There, in the slumbering chapel, at four in the morning, hecould follow the echo of his solitary thoughts down and into the tunnels towhere the trains were berthed or up and around the majestic marble staircaseswhich overlooked the vast commuters’ arena and skyward to the starry dome, wherethe constellations and corresponding mythical gods were painted on the ceiling.This was his grand station for bouncing ideas off Pegasus or Hercules, Virgo,Centaurus, Gemini, Hydra, or Orion. Perhaps Argus (the ship) could provide aclue.Wardenclyffe had become his obsession, and unless he was able to resurrect it intoto, he would never feel fulfilled. In-between measures were out of thequestion. Either he launched the entire edifice, or he would launch none of it.Scherff would visit the plant periodically with his wife, his father, andnewborn baby and handle the money on the taxes and salary for Mr. Hawkins, whowas retained as a guard.But Tesla’s competition had now caught up and in some ways was surpassing, ifnot replacing his vision. Airplanes and zeppelins were dotting the skies, thepowers opposing illuminants without filaments were becoming more entrenched, andwireless transmitters were springing up like mushrooms at the banks of awoodland stream. In January 1908 the French placed a broadcast station atop theEiffel Tower for the purpose of transmitting messages to Morocco. The directorof operations predicted that such impulses “should theoretically go around theworld [and] return to the tower.”5 Lee De Forest began to gain momentum in theStates and soon began contracting with the government and the millionaires forthe erection of “radio-telephones,” which he placed on the roofs of the talleststructures in Manhattan. In 1907 he had aired the voice of Enrico Caruso, whowas singing at the Metropolitan Opera House. Most of the listeners were innearby boats. Concurrently, De Forest had refined a way to boost the speed ofMorse-code transmissions. He could now direct telegrams at the astonishing rateof six hundred words per minute.“I can confidently predict,” De Forest proclaimed, “that within the next fiveyears, every ship…will be equipped with the wireless telephone…I look forward tothe day when by this means, the opera may be brought into every home. Some day,the news and even advertising will be sent out to the public over the wirelesstelephone.” De Forest went on to criticize Marconi’s devices, which still hadnot solved the problem of static interference, and predicted that his new systemfor tuning would eventually become standard.6 The following year, he signed acontract for the “radio wireless” with Bell Telephone and installed operationsbetween Philadelphia and New York.7 Tesla was becoming a footnote to the field,Mr. Boldt hurling his own insult by hiring United Wireless to place twoforty-foot wireless transmitters on the roof of the Waldorf and paying them$3,000 for the work.8Marconi, however, was still the man of the hour, his name a household word, asthe New York Times boasted in every Sunday supplement, a crest banner abovetheir masthead boldly depicting Marconi wireless transmitters traversingcontinents and seas.> THE PRIME MOVER> > The Tesla turbine is the apotheosis of simplicity. It is so violently opposed> to all precedent that it seems unbelievable.9With his wireless “project…evidently far in advance of the times,” Tesla devotedhimself “to other inventions which appealed more to practical men. After yearsof careful thinking, I found that what the world needed most…was an efficientprime mover.” Tesla was referring to his new invention of a powerful andlightweight turbine, one that could be used to replace the gasoline engine inthe car, fitted on airplanes, torpedoes, or ocean liners, or converted into apump for transporting air, solids, or fluids. This remarkable machine could beused to create liquid oxygen or even be placed above incinerators to convertwasted heat into electricity. Born of Dane and Niko’s childhood play withwaterwheels in Smiljan, the multifaceted and revolutionary device first becamemanifest in 1906-07. It was called the bladeless turbine.10> LATEST MARVEL FROM THE MONARCH OF MECHANICS> > Frank Parker Stockbridge> > “You have got what Professor Langley was trying to evolve for his flying> machine, an engine that will give a horse power for a pound of weight,” I> suggested.> > “I have got more than that,” replied Dr. Tesla. “I have an engine that will> give ten horse power to a pound of weight.

It is> an accomplishment that mechanical engineers have been dreaming about ever> since the invention of steam power.”11The inventor thereupon proceeded to explain its principles. Having studied theproperties of water and steam as they passed through a propeller, Tesla exploredthe relationship of viscosity and adhesion to the blade’s corresponding spin.“The metal does not absorb any of the water, but [some of] the water adheres toit. The drop of water may change its shape, [yet its] particles remain intact.This tendency of all fluids to resist separation is viscosity,” the inventorexplained. By exploiting these principles, Tesla had patented an entirely newkind of turbine which did away with the blades of an everyday propeller andreplaced them with a series of disks thinly spaced apart like a stack of pennieson their side. Each disk had a hole in its center for removing the incomingfluid and for turning the central shaft. Whereas “skin friction impedes a shipin its progress through the sea or an aeroplane through the air,” Teslaexploited this seeming obstacle so that the spin of the turbine would beenhanced rather than retarded by the adhesion and viscosity of the medium. Itwas another stroke of genius from the master.Spiral action was initiated at the periphery of each disk as the water formed atighter and tighter corkscrew pattern as the center hole was approached thusaugmenting spiral action. In this way, a fluid under pressure, such as steam,could enter the sealed chamber which housed the horizontal stack of disks andcause them to rotate. Following the natural tendency to create a whirlpool (likewater exiting a drain), the fluid would naturally spin faster and faster as itmoved toward the center. Simultaneously, its property of adhesion would carry,or drag, the corresponding disk around and around at a faster rate, and thisspin could be used, for instance, as a turbine to generate electricity;reversing the entire process would turn the instrument into a pump; and hookingit up to an induction motor could transform the instrument into a jet engine.> “One such pump now in operation, with eight disks, eighteen inches in> diameter, pumps four thousand gallons a minute to a height of 360 feet…> > “Suppose now we reversed the operation,” continued the inventor…Suppose we had> water, or air under pressure, or steam under pressure…and let it run into the> case in which the disks are contained—what would happen?”> > “The disks would revolve and any machinery attached to the shaft would be> operated—you would convert the pump into an engine,” I suggested.> > “That is exactly what would happen—what does happen,” replied Dr. Tesla…> > “Then too,” Dr. Tesla went on, “there are no delicate adjustments to be made.> The distance between the disks is not a matter of microscopic> accuracy…Coupling these engines in series, one can do away with gearing in> machinery…The motor is especially adapted to automobiles, for it will run on> gas explosions as well as on steam…> > “With a thousand horse power engine, weighing only one hundred pounds, imagine> the possibilities.

Anything you can do for me will be much appreciated,” Scherff wrote.13Instead of sending him money, Tesla sent a check for Mrs. Schwarz, yet anotherdisgruntled investor. In need himself, Scherff tried to divert the funds, butTesla, having been in Scherff’s position numerous times, wrote backlightheartedly, “I am sorry to note that you are losing your equanimity andpoise. Mrs. Schwarz is weak and you are fully able to fight your own battles.You must pull yourself together and banish the evil spirits.”14 Shortlythereafter, Scherff sent off another note informing Tesla that he had preparedthe taxes for Wardenclyffe. “A few nights ago,” Scherff added, “a burglarentered my house and cleaned all the cash out of my pockets.” Tesla took thehint and began recompensing his former secretary, sending a check in November.> November 11, 1909> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > Thank you for the $200…What gives me more pleasure than the money is the> concrete evidence it furnishes of your progress towards the success for which> you have battled so long and hard.> > Sincerely,> George Scherff15In March 1909, Tesla had formed the Tesla Propulsion Company with Joseph Hoadleyand Walter H. Knight. With stock capitalized at $1 million, it was announced inElectrical World that turbines were being sold to the Alabama Consolidated Coal& Iron Company.16 Tesla also set up other firms: the Tesla Ozone Company,capitalized at $400,000, which produced ozone, and the Tesla ElectrotherapeuticCompany, which marketed electrotherapeutic machines with Colonel Ray.PRESENT-DAY OZONE THERAPYDuring a recent symposium marking the hundred years since Tesla’s arrival inAmerica, G. Freibott, a medical doctor who used Tesla’s ozoneproducingequipment, stated that by injecting pure ozone directly into the bloodstream ofa man afflicted with colon cancer, “thirty tumors were released.” According toFreibott, this form of oxygen, which is naturally produced by the sun’s actionon the upper reaches of the atmosphere, contains “oxidizing, antiseptic andgermicidal power…bringing palliative and curative results to many individuals.”When questioned about the dangers of creating embolisms, Freibott noted that“air embolisms” are not caused by bubbles of oxygen in the bloodstream, as iscommonly believed, but rather by impurities carried by the oxygen. This work isnew and controversial, although verification of these findings has beenestablished by physicians.17Tesla, of course, did not inject ozone into people; however, he did construct anelectrotherapeutic device for Scherff’s wife, who was suffering from an ailmentat that time. “I believe that it will do you and Mrs. Scherff a lot of good,”Tesla wrote, adding for the sally, “unless you have no electric supply circuitin your home, in which case, it will be necessary to move into otherquarters.”18Throughout 1909 and 1910 the inventor shuffled back and forth betweenProvidence, Bridgeport, and New York City, where he had installed variousrenditions of his turbines. Most of the development work was at Bridgeport.“I am now at work on new ideas of an automobile, locomotive and lathe in whichthese inventions of mine are embodied and which cannot help [but] prove acolossal success,” he wrote Scherff. “The only trouble is to get the cash, butit cannot last very long before my money will come in a torrent and then you cancall on me for anything you like.” He added optimistically in another letter,“Things are developing very favorably, and it seems that my wireless dream willbe realized before next summer.”19In March 1910, Owen’s wife gave birth to their first son, Robert UnderwoodJohnson Jr., but in the spring a potential disaster of foreboding invaded theTesla circle when it was announced that John Jacob Astor and his son Vincentwere lost at sea. The inventor was one of the many who rejoiced when the newsarrived that one of the ten richest men in the world (and his son) emergedunscathed. It is uncertain to what extent Astor contributed to Tesla’s work withthe turbine, however, there is some evidence that the inventor installed ahydrofoil jet engine in a “mysterious craft” Astor had docked in the HarlemRiver. The New York Times reported that the vehicle “seemed to embody an airshipwith a practical water craft.”20 If this was a radical flying machine whichTesla was working on, both he and Astor made sure that the reporters were keptaway. One of the advantages of such a prototype was that the danger of deathresulting from experimental flights could be minimized, since the craft wastheoretically set up to hover only above water.Feeling well on the way to success, Tesla wrote his friend Charles Scott at theWestinghouse Corporation for an order of a million induction motors to drive histurbines. “But as I have learned to go slow,” he added to the letter, “I shalltake only one at first.”21In November 1910, with his newfound tidal wave of momentum, he moved hisheadquarters to the prestigious forty-eight-story Metropolitan Towers, locatedat 1 Madison Avenue, just across the way from the Garden. With an office suiteon the twentieth floor, right beneath the skyscraper’s famous tower clock, theinventor could look out on the burgeoning metropolis from the tallest buildingin the world to plan his next move for the recapture of his holy grail, hisworld-telegraphy scheme."},{"pageContent":"38THE HAMMOND CONNECTION (1909-13) [002-toc.html#ch38]> November 8, 1910> > My dear Mr. Hammond [Jr.],> > I was glad to read the enclosed newspaper reports.

Tesla1It is unclear as to exactly when, and in what capacity, John Hays Hammond Sr.became involved financially with Nikola Tesla. John O’Neill, who knew theinventor for nearly forty years, wrote in his biography that Hammond Senior gaveTesla a gift of $10,000 for the development of the telautomaton, which wasunveiled in 1898.2 John Hays Hammond Jr., or “Jack” Hammond, contradicted thisassertion, writing twelve years after the book’s publication, “My father wasfinancing one of his later inventions and in this way, I had the opportunity ofmeeting him even while I was at Yale (1907-1910).”3 Thus, based on Jack’sletter, Hammond Senior most likely helped finance Tesla’s bladeless turbine,although he may have invested in Wardenclyffe or some other enterprise.In either case, it is unlikely that Hammond presented Tesla with an outright“gift,” so it is clear that at least part of O’Neill’s statement is incorrect.One of Hammond Senior’s oldest friends stemming from childhood was Darius OgdenMills. Both men grew up as California gold miners.4 Mills, a long-standingfriend of Stanford White’s, became a principal in the Edison IlluminatingCompany back in 1883, along with J. Pierpont Morgan.5 As a business associate ofJohn Jacob Astor in the late 1890s, Mills was involved in the financing of theNiagara Falls enterprise and probably invested in Tesla’s company as well. Teslaalso knew Hammond’s brother Richard, who had been to Niagara Falls to hear theinventor’s invocation.Having correctly anticipated a “depression” resulting from Grover Cleveland’s1892 election, Hammond had traveled with his wife and family to South Africa torun the Bernarto Brothers’ gold and diamond mines. Thus, he was on the otherside of the globe at the time of Tesla’s work in telautomatics. Nevertheless, itis entirely possible that through Mills, Hammond participated in the venture.Jack Hammond, who would have been ten years old in 1898, would have thereforelearned about this technology at an impressionable age. As the focus of Jack’sextraordinary career revolved around his work in radio-guided weaponry systems,this early Tesla connection would help explain his ardent interest. AlthoughJack made no secret of crediting Tesla as being the primary inventor oftelautomatics, he may still have wished to suppress Tesla’s ultimate role ininfluencing so greatly the direction his life would take.According to Jack Hammond’s research, “Prof. Ernest Wilson in 1897 controlled atorpedo on the Thames by Hertzian waves. He is the pioneer inventor in thisart.”7JOHN HAYS HAMMOND SR.John Hays Hammond Sr., whose life became fictionalized as the “heroic Clay inSoldiers of Fortune,”8 was the ultimate daredevil. Born in 1855, Hammond’smaternal grandfather, Col. John Coffee Hays, was a Texas Ranger and the firstsheriff of the “wickedest city in the world,” the seaport and bonanza town ofSan Francisco. Raised in California during the gold rush, Hammond’s father,Richard Pindell Hammond, was a West Point graduate and a friend of Robert E.Lee’s and also Franklin Pierce. Hammond was also a gold miner and federal taxcollector for the port of San Francisco.Schooled at Yale University with a major in mining, Hammond continued hisstudies in the mid-1870s in Europe. After his return, the energetic adventurerset out for the Sierra Madre in his search for silver and gold. Traveling withhis family and brother Richard, Hammond encountered Apache Indians on thewarpath and Mexican desperadoes in his quest for buried treasure. “By way ofencouragement,” Hammond stated, “my wife frequently declared that in case Dickand I should be killed, she would faithfully promise to shoot: first thewomen,…then her child and then herself, rather than have them fall into thehands of the Indians.”9Other excursions included travel through alligator-infested swamps in CentralAmerica and “the cannibal country of Columbia.”10 Successful in finding gold inGuatemala, Hammond also opened up lead and silver mines throughout Mexico andthe Midwest. In 1891, with a six-gun strapped to each hip, he helped quell aviolent mining strike in Montana; but in 1893, unhappy with the new Democraticadministration, he decided to leave America, taking his family with him, tofulfill his childhood dream of searching for diamonds in the depths of the DarkContinent.Placed in charge of the British Consolidated Gold Fields, Hammond made hisfortune when he realized that searching for diamonds twenty-five hundred feetunder the ground would be much more lucrative when this type of land was sellingfor $10 per acre, whereas shallow mining stakes were going for $40,000 peracre.11Among his children, the most precocious was a five-year-old named John HaysHammond Jr., or Jack. There was also Harris, six years Jack’s elder, Richard, ayounger brother, and Nathalie, a little sister.Swept into the Boer War in 1896, Hammond was arrested by the Transvaalgovernment. Captured with Cecil Rhodes and the infamous Dr. Jameson, who had leda revolt against the Dutch, the elite members of the mining syndicate weresentenced to death by firing squad. With a plea from the U.S. secretary of stateand perhaps a nudge from Mark Twain, who was in South Africa at the time, theywere finally able to buy their way out. According to Hammond, Twain had informedthe Dutch that they had captured “some of the wealthiest bugs in the world.”President Krueger placed the ransom at $600,000, or $125,000 a piece. WithRhodes fronting the booty, the deal was struck, and they were released. Hammond,with his wife and family, were free to return to the States. He would pay backhis share with future profits from new mining ventures.Considered one of the wealthiest industrialists in the world, with a list offriends that included three presidents and former Yale classmate William HowardTaft, John Hays Hammond Sr. became a natural choice for vice president.Resigning from the Guggenheim copper coalition, Hammond sought the position asTaft’s running mate with full vigor in 1908,12 during the initial years ofTesla’s partnership with his son Jack.JOHN HAYS HAMMOND JR.After a short stay in England in 1900, the Hammond family returned to the Statesand took up residence in Washington, D.C. Hammond Senior also had an office onWall Street and a summer home in New Jersey. Having a keen interest ininventors, the mining engineer invited many of them to his home. Included on thelist were Alexander Graham Bell, Guglielmo Marconi, Tom Edison, Nikola Tesla,and the Wright brothers.13 In 1901, when Jack was just twelve years old, he wasinvited with his father to Menlo Park. There Edison, who was working on “a newprocess to extract gold from South African ore, showed Jack models of his firstphonograph, and gave the youth some original sketches. It may have been thiscontact,” Hammond speculated, “that stimulated my son’s interest in the study ofelectricity.”14Shortly after Jack entered Yale in 1906, he began to study Tesla’s inventions.He also worked for Alexander Graham Bell. Thus, it was during his college yearsthat his interest in remote control became (re)awakened. “Tesla and Bell were,so to speak, my scientific god-fathers,” Jack wrote in his diary. “I found themdeeply inspiring.”15 Jack’s “experiments started in early 1908, when hedeveloped an electric steering and [also an] engine control for a boat…[finding]that he could control this mechanism over short distances with a radioimpulse.”16It was at this time that the Hammonds set up permanent residence on the harborat the fishing village of Gloucester, Massachusetts, and it was there that theenthusiastic engineering student performed most of his investigations. Destinedto have more patents than any American inventor except Tom Edison, Jack beganhis interest in inventing during his New Jersey prep-school years. His firstsignificant creation, at age sixteen, was a reverse switch which automaticallyturned off his night light when the headmaster opened his dorm door to check tosee if he was reading after curfew.17 After this, the floodgates were opened,and by the end of his career, John Hays Hammond Jr. had amassed an astoundingarray of over eight hundred patents, including inventions in the fields ofmilitary warfare, music and sound (no relation to W. H. Hammond of electricorganfame), and home appliances. Some of Jack’s most unique contributions include acigarette case which “popped out a lit cigarette when opened,” a microwave oven,a push-button radio, a superheterodyne (which greatly amplified radio waves andwas coincident with Edwin Armstrong), aircraft guidance systems, atime-controlled gas bomb, a magnetic bottle cap, a combinationpiano-radio-phonograph, a windshield washer, a mobile housing unit, and a“telestereographer,” or “mechanism for projecting three-dimensional images viawireless.”18In September 1909, during his senior year, the budding wunderkind wrote to hisfather to arrange for a meeting with the “Serbian High Priest ofTelautomatics.”19 “Father, I have some important information that I desire toget from Mr. Tesla.”20Hammond Senior, who had just lost his bid for the vice-presidential slot, madethe arrangements. Jack met the fifty-three-year-old inventor at his MetropolitanTowers office in New York the week of September 26, and it is most likely thatTesla reciprocated by visiting Gloucester shortly thereafter. Hammond requestedthat Tesla send his patent information on wireless control of machinery, andTesla did so before the end of the month.21Moonlighting at the patent office in Washington D.C., Jack had already rigged,by this time, a forty-foot vessel to be maneuvered by means of wireless. Hisbroadcasting system, in part based on a Marconi design, also utilized Teslaoscillators and contained “two 360-foot radio control towers near the laboratoryoverlooking Freshwater Cove…With these devices, a man standing at a shorelookout station could steer an empty boat in the water.”22 Jack also asked Teslato speak at his Yale graduation.23This period in Tesla’s life was marked by extreme bitterness because Marconi wasrewarded for his piracy with the Nobel Prize in December. Tesla informed Jackthat the Italian tinkerer had “abandoned the old devices of Hertz and Lodge andsubstituted mine instead. In this manner the transmission across the Atlanticwas effected.”24 Jack, however, held no ill will toward Marconi and included himprominently in the four-volume compendium he was writing on the history ofwireless communication. He also invited Marconi to the Gloucester compound andformed a friendship that would last well into the 1930s.25Having returned from a European excursion, where he had visited electricalengineers (and psychic researchers) in London, Paris, and St. Petersburg, Jackwas able to complete his master’s dissertation:> Mr. Tesla in 1892 showed that the true Hertzian effect was not a means by> which it was possible for a sending station to communicate with a receiving> station at any great distance.

Today Mr. Marconi says that the maximum effective distance of> transmission is 6,000 miles.26Perturbed with Hammond’s decision to highlight Marconi’s dubious achievementsand proceed in his field of remote control, Tesla sought compensation. Workingwith Fritz Lowenstein and Alexander Graham Bell, Jack invented a “mechanicaldog” which followed its “master” when a lantern was beamed at it. Created in theshape of a milk carton on wheels, the “critter” made use of selenium cells for“eyes” to receive the glimmering command signal. Hammond assured Tesla that hewas not infringing upon his work in telautomatics, but Tesla remainedunconvinced, especially after an article in the newspapers reported that Hammondwas in the midst of displaying remote controlled torpedoes to the military.My dear Mr. Hammond,> Judging from the enclosed, I think that you are playing a wireless possum.> Notwithstanding your assurances, I will watch your progress and bring a> friendly suit for infringement as soon as I ascertain that you are in funds.27Jack wrote back to reconfirm that he would give proper credit, but Tesla wanteda contract and a percentage of any profits.“My dear Mr. Tesla,” the twenty-two-year-old wrote back, “I am very agreeable toshare the profits with you, but I shall only on the condition that you share ourliabilities also.”28“As I naturally surmise that your Papa would pay all our liabilities,” Teslareplied, “I am willing to share in these.”29Aside from the banter, Tesla was hoping that Hammond would succeed in hisinterface with the military, for now he would have a market for selling his newbladeless engines. Soon a partnership was formed, Hammond Senior footing thebill.“Go in on this with your brother Harris,” Jack’s father cautioned. “He is olderthan you and more experienced. And be careful with Mr. Tesla. He tends to spendgold as if it were copper.”Having studied Tesla’s method of selective tuning, Jack came to call it the“1903 prophetic genius patent.”30 Tesla had created this invention due to arecurrent problem which he had noticed in 1894-95, namely, that he had beenhaving difficulty illuminating particular bulbs in his laboratory withoutilluminating others. After studying the work of Herbert Spencer on the combinedaction of two or more nerves in the human body, the inventor came upon a planwhereby bulbs would illuminate only when a combination of more than onefrequency was transmitted. Jack noted that “Mr. Tesla resembles his system to acombination lock.”31 Explaining the particulars to the initiate, Tesla showedthat devices could be made to respond not only to one frequency but to two,three, or even more. This combined arrangement, analogous to today’s TV andtelephone scramblers, would not only ensure privacy, it would also allow for asystem with a virtually unlimited number of separate channels.32The corresponding patent, along with Tesla’s method of utilizing resonant earthfrequencies for transmission, that is, Tesla currents, became the backbone for aplethora of inventions ranging from military guidance systems to radio andtelecommunications. The further development and refinement of this foundationwould also eventually make Jack and a few other inventors millionaires, forexample, Edwin H. Armstrong.In 1911, writing from the patent office, where Jack was still employed, thewilling prodigy informed Tesla that he had contacted the War Department with thehope of selling ship-to-shore communication systems capable of transmittingtwenty words per minute. Jack had also begun the construction of amilitary-linked think tank at Gloucester, where he hired such competentengineers as Fritz Lowenstein and Benjamin Franklin Meissner. Born in 1890,Meissner, who would come to author a textbook on radiodynamics with some helpfrom Tesla,33 became chief assistant at the lab. Having worked for the U.S. Navyin 1908, Meissner had aided in the development of the electric dog andsuperheterodyne. He is also credited with inventing the “cat whisker” which wasa detector on the crystal radio set.” Jack was also conferring with ReginaldFessenden, Lee de Forest, John S. Stone, and Guglielmo Marconi.> Washington, DC> > February 16, 1911> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > Let us create an unpretentious company and call it the Tesla-Hammond Wireless> Development Company.

Tesla36Writing on his classy Wardenclyffe letterhead, with the magnifying transmitterposing at the top of the page, the inventor pens, in the estimation of thisauthor, a most exasperating dispatch. The tiff that Tesla had with Morgan hadbeen held in secret. Only a handful of people even knew the details of theircontract. Even Tesla’s closest friends and latter-day biographers were kept inthe dark. However, on another level, it had become obvious by 1911 to all butTesla that Wardenclyffe was a ship with a lead hull.Still intoxicated with the world-telegraphy idea, filled with hope that his newbladeless turbines would cause a revolution, the perennial iconoclast embarkedfoolhardly, albeit courageously, on the best-case scenerio: that he would raiseenough capital with new inventions to finally return to Long Island to completethe tower.Perhaps it was still possible at this juncture of his life if his motor, forinstance, replaced the gasoline engine in the automobile or the prop engine inthe airplane. However, what was not possible was the intimation in the letterthat Morgan was still “interested.” This was a blatant display of disinformationwhich the pompous Waldorf dandy conceitedly proclaimed in order to hide the veryfact, maybe even to himself, that his optimism was possibly delusion.Here was a chance to develop a concrete wireless system with the backing of thewealthy and powerful Hammond lineage, but Tesla turned the opportunity awaybecause of arrogant, tunnel-minded, and narcissistic proclivities—and possiblybecause of contractual limitations imposed by the Morgan contract. Had hedeveloped the wireless scheme with Jack, he may have had to legally compensateMorgan with 51 percent of any developments he achieved. Hammond hadn’t figuredthat the star he had hitched himself to was a half-baked comet.THE APOSTLE OF FIGMENTSIn May 1911, T. C. Martin invited Tesla to address thirteen hundred members ofthe National Electric Light Association, which was holding its annual symposiumat the Engineering Society Building on Thirty-ninth Street.“There is no enjoyment that I could picture in my mind so exquisite as thetriumph which follows an original invention or discovery,” the inculcationbegan. “But the world is not always ready to accept the dictum of the inventor,and doubters are plentiful, so that discoverers have often to swallow bitterpills, along with their pleasure.”But what magniloquent pills would this mad scientist force his congregation toingest! Tesla proceeded to dazzle the audience with slides of his AC polyphasesystem, telautomaton, and world wireless experiments, flashing pictures fromColorado with streamers extending sixty-five feet.In discussing his method of individuation, he stated that the broadcasting ofcombination and multiple frequencies was benefited in a system that did not usewires. “All the statements that you read in the newspapers that wirelessmessages are interfered with,” the inventor explained, “are because the workersin that field are laboring under delusions—they are transmitting messages byHertz waves, and in this way no secrecy is possible.”Having skyrocketed his vision to a world which was not of this earth, the wizardstepped into the shoes of Prometheus. “Now, the discovery [of standing wavesthat] I have made upset all that has gone before, for there was a means ofprojecting energy into space, absolutely without loss from any point of theglobe to another, to the antipodes, if desired. In fact, a force impressed atone point could be made to increase with distance…You can imagine how profoundlyI was affected by this revelation. Technically, it meant that the earth, as awhole, had a certain period of vibration.”37Set against a sky of thunderclouds, the Wardenclyffe citadel was flashed on thescreen, its mushroom-shaped vertex looming.“I have annihilated distance in my scheme,” deus roared, “and when perfected, itwill not be one mite different than my present plans call for. The air will bemy medium, and I will be able to transmit energy of any amount to any place. Iwill be able to issue messages to all parts of the world and send [forth] wordswhich will come out of the ground in the Sahara Desert with such force that theycan be heard for fifteen miles around.”38“It would be possible by my powerful wireless transmitter, to light the entireUnited States. The current would pass into the air and, spreading in alldirections, produce the effect of a strong aurora borealis. It would be a softlight, but sufficient to distinguish objects.”39 Naturally, the tower would alsobe powerful enough to send signals to nearby planets, especially if there wereany Martians out there to receive them.And this was just the introduction to the topic he came to divulge that night:the Tesla bladeless turbine.Tesla began to work on his new engines in earnest, shuffling between Providenceand Bridgeport, with most of his operations now shifted to the New York EdisonWaterside Station. He also looked for prospective clients. One of his plans wasto sell, probably through Jacob Schiff, five hundred engines to the Japanese.“By applying my turbine to their torpedo,” Tesla wrote Jack’s brother Harris, “Ican double the power. We should negotiate royalties on the basis ofhorsepower.”40 Tesla also conferred with GE and the exuberant SeiberlingCompany, leaders in the development of high-speed power boats.41Promising “great success,” the vulcan worked overtime, forging his revolutionaryequipment, as Jack continued perfecting a prototype remoteoperated boat and awireless broadcasting station. With a range of two thousand miles, the Hammondtransmitter became “the most important private sending station in the world.”Jack also studied telephotography, and he worked on perfecting his electric dog.“And, if you reverse the motor by pushing over the tail switch,” Jack announcedto the press, “you can make the dog back away most surprisingly in eitherdirection when you advance upon him with the light.”42Expanding his market, Tesla designed prototypes that could transmutate thegasoline engine in the automobile; he began to make overtures to Ford MotorCompany and also Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, who was planning on putting them intanks. As with any new creation, there were problems. For instance, because theball bearings were wearing down too quickly, the disks were not maintainingtheir spins at optimum accelerations. As a “sun dodger,” Tesla also had apenchant for working throughout the night, and therefore his labor costs wereoften double. Naturally, there were other expenditures.Jack suggested more publicity and sent over the well-known journalist WaldemarKaempffert to interview, in Kaempffert’s words, the “temperamental genius” forScientific American.43 But in Tesla’s estimation he had enough publicity. Heneeded more capital.Throughout the latter part of 1912 and through the first months of the new year,Tesla sent urgent pleas to his partner. He had expended $18,000, had workedwithout salary for all this time, and required $10,000 back immediately.> Dear Mr. Hammond,> > …in desperate need of money. I am unable to hold out any longer.44But Hammond, who was helping Lowenstein install his wireless equipment aboardnavy ships and competing against De Forest for a $50,000 amplifier deal withAT&T, ignored the request, his brother Harris taking a full quarter of a year torespond:> June 10, 1913> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > As you know, we have advanced a great many thousands of dollars in the> development of this turbine and have expected each week the past year to be in> a position to have tested it…[Now] we find that the turbine is only partially> set up at the Edison plant…[We are missing] a splendid opportunity of having> it thoroughly and honestly tested by people who would be the greatest benefit> to us should these tests be successful.> > Sincerely yours,> Harris HammondThe High Priest of Telautomatics was incapable of believing that the son of oneof the richest men in the world was scorning his entreaty. “Since my notice, Ihave done the best I could to save what was possible, the sacrifices which Ihave been compelled to make and the losses which I have suffered are such thatif I were dealing with a man less attractive to me than yourself, I woulddisdain to answer.” Tesla also enclosed glowing testaments to the turbine fromprofessors and chief engineers, but the partnership was over.45 Hammond wouldnot come through.THE CASTLE THAT JACK BUILTJack Hammond traveled to Europe only months before World War I to confer withvarious scientists in order to perfect a better receiving instrument than theMarconi coherer. It appears that Tesla and Hammond were working at crosspurposes. As would become obvious, the $10,000 Tesla requested would not havebeen sufficient to complete his work on the turbines. He probably needed fortyor fifty times that figure, and Jack’s main interest lay in the perfection ofwireless transmitting and receiving apparatus. The torpedo propellants werereally secondary.In retrospect, it seems that Tesla might have been better off abandoning theturbine for the time being and working with Jack to perfect the guidance system;but he was too close to a potential major success to sink more time into aninvention he had already perfected fifteen years earlier. Jack would go on in1913 and 1914 to demonstrate his remote-controlled boat before the U.S. militaryelite. General Weaver, chief of the U.S. Coast Artillery, and a small entouragetraveled up to Gloucester to witness the Natalia, the prodigal son’s newestsuccess, the general even taking the controls himself. “Again and again theflashing craft shot forth and manoeuvered [sic] about the harbor under invisiblecontrol, while natives of Gloucester gasped in amazement…They saw her headed fora definite mark a mile away, two miles, three miles away, and strike it withprecision every time.”46A few weeks later, Hammond Junior demonstrated the long-range capabilities ofthe vessel. It could operate while twenty miles away from the Gloucester radiotransmitter and in one way or another was directed the full distance of sixtymiles to the naval base at Newport by means of wireless. Jack had also perfectedthe problem of static interference and selective tuning. In December he wrote:> My dear father,> > We are now drawing up as systematically as possible the whole proposition to> the present to the Board of Ordinance. This work means a good deal in the> future financial success of the proposition.> > I am your affectionate son,> John Hays Hammond Jr.47It would be many years, however, before the U.S. government recompensed Jack forhis remote-controlled guidance system. He would expend over the next decade inthe neighborhood of three-quarters of a million dollars on the operation,expanding the system of radiodynamic control to include aircraft as wellsubmersibles.48 Problems in the creation of secret channels were made apparentin 1915 and 1916 when the USS Dolphin successfully interfered with a torpedolaunched by Hammond over distances of two hundred to three hundred feet, but theHammond system was successful when the torpedo was launched farther away.49 TheWar Department also wanted to sustain visual contact of the weapon, so Jackbegan working on a device to be directed from flying machines. Every problem heencountered he was able to overcome.The technology was still too new to be used during World War I, and the militarykept avoiding expenditures of any funds. Ostensibly waiting for Tesla’sfundamental telautomatic patents to expire, Jack finally presented his casebefore members of Congress. He stated that he had overtures from foreigngovernments, but he would refuse to negotiate with them because of theimportance of the work and loyalty to his country. And so, in 1919, while hisfather, John Hays Hammond Sr., continued to gain publicity for his idea of aWorld Court to prevent war, the U.S. Congress and President Wilson approved anappropriation of $417,000 for the war patents for Hammond’s son; however, stillno monies changed hands.50In the 1920s, Jack began working with David Sarnoff, who, along with GuglielmoMarconi and Edwin Armstrong, was forming the seeds of the Radio Corporation ofAmerica (RCA). And, in 1923, the fruits of his labor paid off when Jack sold aseries of wireless patents to RCA for $500,000,51 but he was still to becompensated by the U.S. government. In 1924, Hammond sent yet another dispatchto the War Department to gain the release of the appropriated funds, which werenow up to $750,000. “I have brought the development to a state where we havedemonstrated the feasibility of control of standard naval torpedoes whilerunning at depths of 6 feet or over, submerged at speeds of 27-30 knots/hr,”Hammond wrote.52 Finally, in December 1924, with the help of Curtis Wilbur,secretary of the navy and admirer of Hammond’s father, the government made good,recompensing Hammond and assigning his work to a secret file in the patentoffice. Assurances were also given that their exclusive patents did not competewith those sold to RCA. All this took place a full decade after his breakup withhis Serbian mentor, who “now [had] the pleasure of simply looking on when othersare using my inventions.”“I wish him luck,” Tesla said. “But still, I ought to have had something forit.” Tesla also pointed out that Hammond sought his patents just a few monthsafter Tesla’s had run out.53Now a millionaire on his own merits, Jack set out to fulfill a dream that beganin his youth, when the family moved to England, namely, to live in a castle. Healso fell in love with an artist, Irene Fenton, a lovely daughter of ashipbuilder who unfortunately was married to a shoe merchant. Irene, forty-five,got divorced and married Jack, thirty-seven, clandestinely in 1925, as he beganconstruction of the medieval dwelling which was situated on the cloistered andtreacherous coastal cliffs where Longfellow wrecked the fictitious schoonerHesperus in Gloucester. The site was less than a mile from his parent’s home.54Jack’s passion was music. Although not a musician, he had many acousticalpatents and also an organ that was so enormous, comprising eight thousand pipes,that a palace would be the only edifice capable of housing it. Hammond designedthe all-stone building around the instrument, complete with parapets, a moat,and a chain-link drawbridge. Inside could be found dark, winding corridors,hidden doorways, and breakaway walls at the entrance of the great room formoving organ pipes into it and out. In the center of the castle, which today isa museum, Hammond placed an indoor swimming pool and an atrium filled withplants and tropical birds. Ancient artifacts from Europe were purchased, and anude statue of the celebrated innovator was sculpted, Irene designing a metalfig leaf to subdue the piece.Jack continued to work on a long series of top-secret inventions for the WarDepartment and for himself as he lived the life of the bon vivant. Visitors tohis estate and to his pipe-organ concerts in the 1930s included the Hearsts,George Gershwin, Helen Hayes, David Sarnoff, Ann and Theodore Edison, theMarconis, J. Pierpont Morgan’s daughter Louisa and her husband, HerbertSatterlee, Helen Astor, Marie Carnegie, David Rockefeller, the Barrymores, NoëlCoward, and Leopold Stokowski.It is doubtful that Tesla ever visited the castle, although he might have, buton March 30, 1951, nearly a decade after the Serb’s death, another Slav andTeslarian, Andrija Puharich, stopped by.55 Still interested in extrasensoryperception, Jack had invited Puharich, a medical doctor and inventor of hearingaids, along with psychic Eileen Garrett, to his citadel for the purpose oftesting her telepathic abilities. Placed in a Faraday cage so thatelectromagnetic waves could be screened out, Garrett performed at a level thatastounded the experimenters.56A world traveler and prodigious innovator throughout his life, Jack spent muchof his time in the latter years traveling, with his wife, across the country ina mobile home he had designed. One day on a trip to see his friend IgorSikorsky, in Bridgeport, the inventor of the helicopter asked if Jack wanted oneas a present. “Only if it can take my mobile home,” Jack responded. After a longpause, with time out to stare at the mobile monstrosity, Igor responded, “It canbe done.”John Hays Hammond Jr. died in 1965 at the age of seventy-seven. A genius in hisown right, it is unfortunate that his relationship with Tesla was thwarted.Together they invented a rather sizable chunk of the appliances of the modernera."},{"pageContent":"39J. P.

M. Maxwell, superintendent of NewYork’s public schools, on a controversial project to electrify classrooms withhigh-frequency currents. Following in the footsteps of a highly publicizedexperiment in Stockholm whereby a group of children in such an environmentapparently showed increased scores on aptitude tests and accelerated growth,Maxwell was hoping to boost the health and intelligence of students in America.With the prestigious inventor wiring the walls with his “Tesla coil,”guaranteeing complete safety, and concurring with the general conclusions of thehypothesis, Tesla helped Maxwell set up a pilot study with “fifty mentallydefective school children.” If the study proved successful, the superintendentboldly stated, “the new system would overturn all methods hitherto applied inits schools and introduce a new era in education.”2Marconi’s talk, before eleven hundred members of the New York ElectricalSociety, was held on the very day the Titanic sank. Frank Sprague, who gave theeulogy, “visibly affected Mr. Marconi when he credited him with saving the livesof from 700 to 800 persons.”3 Unfortunately, Marconi was unable to save fifteenhundred other individuals, including Colonel Astor, who went down with the shipafter helping his new bride board one of the remaining lifeboats.If ever an event epitomized the loss of innocence, the myopic condition ofhumanity, it was the sinking of the Titanic. Reminiscent of Tesla’s own voyage,this watershed recapitulated the story of Icarus, the prideful aeronaut whocrumbled because of lack of respect for his limitations. With Tesla’s outlandishwish to transmit unlimited energy to the far reaches of the world and bring rainto the deserts, to become a master of the universe, it was inevitable that he,too, would succumb. The tragedy prompted Congress to pass into law an actrequiring the use of wireless equipment on all ships carrying fifty or morepassengers. It also focused national attention on twenty-one-year old DavidSarnoff, latter-day head of RCA, who was credited as the first wireless operatorto pick up the Titanic distress signal.4Tesla was not the only casualty in the wireless game. Reginald Fessenden’sconcern “all but ceased functioning in 1912” due to his erratic nature,infighting, and “prolonged litigation.” And Lee De Forest, who by now had nearlyforty patents in wireless, also went under when he was convicted with officersof his company in a stock fraud.5 Concerning Lowenstein, Tesla was backing hisprotégé’s attempts to install equipment on U.S. Navy ships using equipment basedon some of his fundamental designs. “He is much abler than the rest of thewireless men,” he wrote Scherff, “[so] this has given me great pleasure.”6 Theone edge Lowenstein had over Marconi was the Italian’s insistence on anall-or-nothing deal with the military. Either all ships were hooked into hissystem, or none were. The U.S. government, however, was loath to relinquishtheir upper hand to a private concern, so Marconi had great difficultyintegrating his system into the American marketplace.Nevertheless, Marconi was still the only major competitor, so Tesla set out toreestablish his legal right. Conferring with his lawyers, the pioneer began astrategy to sue the pirate in every country he could.In England, Tesla had allowed an important patent to lapse, so progress therewas halted. Oliver Lodge, on the other hand, was able to prevail and received1,000 pounds per year for seven years from the Marconi concern there.7 In theUnited States, where Tesla was applying for a renewal of his most fundamentalpatent, he had yet to formalize the suit, but in “the highest court in France”the inventor achieved a resounding success. Sending his written testimony toJudge M. Bonjean in Paris, Tesla explained his work in 1895, when he “erected alarge wireless terminal above the building…[and] employed damped and undampedoscillations.” He also enclosed two patents from 1897 and specifications for histelautomaton, which confirmed that he had displayed it before G. D. Seely, theexaminer-in-chief of the U.S. Patent Office in Washington, D.C. in 1898.Concerning Marconi’s June 2, 1896, patent, Tesla testified that the patent was“but a mass of imperfection and error…If anything, it has been the means ofmisleading many experts and retarding progress in the right direction…It givesno hint as to the length of the transmitting and receiving conductors and thearrangements illustrated preclude the possibility of accurate tuning…[Marconireplaced] the old-fashioned Rumhkorff coil [with]…the Tesla coil.”8Speaking in support of Tesla’s cause for Popoff, Ducretet & Rochefort, theFrench company that had initiated the action, was electrical engineer M. E.Girardeau, who described in detail the technical accomplishments of Tesla’sinvention. “Indeed,” Girardeau began, “one finds in the American patentextraordinary clearness and precision, surprising even to physicists oftoday…What a cruel injustice would it be now to try to stifle the pure glory ofTesla in opposing him scornfully.”9Judge Bonjean struck down Marconi’s patents and reestablished Tesla’s assuperseding. Most likely, compensation was also paid to him from the Frenchcompany that won the case.With this victory, however, came other defeats. The year 1912 saw legalentanglements against Tesla by Edmund K. Stallo, who was seeking damages of$61,000 for advances tendered in 1906; and also the Westinghouse Corporation,which sued for $23,000 for equipment loaned out in 1907. In the first instance,the Stallo syndicate, which had ties to Standard Oil, had invested only $3,500and was frivolously suing for the promise of an enormous profit. The inventor’sliability was thus minimal. In the second instance, Tesla argued that he was notpersonally liable, as the machinery was loaned to the company he was organizing.He did offer, however, to return the equipment which was still being guarded atthe Long Island laboratory.10 Although his financial losses were small, thenegative publicity undermined his reputation and caused the inventor to become amore invisible presence at the prestigious Waldorf, where he was still residingand piling up debt. And then there was Mrs. Tierstein, who Tesla said, “wantedto shoot me for throwing electricity at her.” Tesla “pitied the poor woman” buthad her sent, by way of Judge Foster, “to the asylum.”11The suit by Westinghouse caused quite a stir among the inner circle, and evenprompted Tom Edison to pen a rare missive of commiseration.> February 24, 1912> > My dear Mr. Edison,> > Acknowledging your kind letter…I wish to reiterate the sentiments and express> my great regret that I was unable to transmit them in person.> > With assurance of high regard, I remain as ever,> > N. Tesla12The Westinghouse Corporation, however, was not a monolithic enterprise, and itslegal department, in some ways, was an autonomous entity. Tesla continued toborrow equipment on a regular basis throughout the period (1909-17), and hefrequently conferred with various engineers, particularly Charles Scott, whom hebegan educating in the field of wireless. Tesla also continued to meet with therecently deposed chieftain George Westinghouse, who was working insemiretirement at his offices in New York City.“I suppose you cannot help feeling disappointed at the ingratitude of some whoare now heading the great enterprise which your genius has created,” theinventor remarked. “I sincerely hope that you will very shortly be again in theposition you have heretofore occupied. I know that the large majority of thepublic shares my sentiments.”“Thank you for your concern,” the descendent of Russian noblemen replied.13THE GERMAN CONNECTIONMarconi’s greatest rival in the legal arena may have been Nikola Tesla, but inthe battleground of the marketplace it was Telefunken, the German wirelessconcern. Although Marconi had patents in Germany, the Telefunken syndicate hadtoo many important connections on its home front and easily maintained amonopoly there. Formed through a forced merger, under orders of the kaiser, ofthe Braun-Siemens-Halske and Arco-Slaby systems, Telefunken had fought theMarconi conglomerate vigorously on every front. It was, without doubt, thenumber-two competitor in the world. Although Marconi had achieved a recent coupin Spain, Telefunken gained an edge in America when it constructed two enormoustransatlantic systems in Tuckerton, New Jersey, and Sayville, New York.For nationalistic reasons, Tesla had been prohibited from obtaining his rightfulroyalties in Germany, but Professor Adolf Slaby never hid the fact that heconsidered Tesla the patriarch in the field. Thus, when Telefunken came toAmerica, Slaby sought out his mentor not only on moral grounds but also forgaining a legal foothold against Marconi and to obtain the inventor’s technicalexpertise.A meeting was held between Tesla and the principles of Telefunken’s Americanholding company, the innocuous-sounding Atlantic Communication Company, at 111Broadway, the location of their offices. Present was its director, Dr. KarlGeorge Frank, “one of the best known German [American] electrical experts,” andhis two managers, Richard Pfund, a frequent visitor to Tesla’s lab, who was headof the Sayville plant, and “the monocle,” Lt. Emil Meyers, head of operations atTuckerton.Tesla asked for an advance of $25,000 and royalties of $2,500 per month butsettled for $1,500 per month, with a one month advance.14 The inventor met withPfund to discuss the turbine deal with the kaiser and also to fix a transmitterthat the Germans were working on at the Manhattan office. Shortly thereafter, hetraveled out to the two wireless stations with his plan to institute his latestrefinements in order to boost their capabilities.15 With Professor JonathanZenneck out at Sayville, Tesla calculated that they were wasting nearly 25percent of their energy in electromagnetic radiations. “Those waves willdissipate only a few miles off shore,” he told Zenneck, “whereas the energy thatwill reach Germany will be from your ground connection.”16After a grueling search along the imponderable ice field, John Jacob Astor’semaciated body was fished from the sea for a New York funeral. Documents fromhis estate revealed five hundred shares of Tesla Electric Company.17 A yearlater, J. Pierpont Morgan, the sultan of Wall Street, the octopus, was dead.Considering the resentment and disillusionment the inventor felt, he also boregreat admiration for the man he called a “towering” historical figure.Although Morgan’s son-in-law, Herbert Satterlee, could only provide a back-rowseat at the chapel, nevertheless, even to be present at the solemn occasion wasa great honor. The hall was speckled with numerous faces of colleagues andadversaries, many of whom could track a large percentage of their wealth, andeven their station, to Tesla’s creations. No doubt, the inventor endured somesnickering, particularly from the hydra’s underlings, but Tesla, ever thenobleman, transcended the petty titters as he walked up to Anne and J. P.Junior.“Please accept my heartfelt condolences on the death of the great man who wasthe head of your famous firm,” he told them. “When I can feel such a void in myheart and brain at the passing of Morgan, I can appreciate, in a measure, thedepth of feeling of those who were his lifelong comrades. All the world knew himas a genius of rare powers, but to me he appears as one of those colossalfigures of [the] past which mark epochs in the evolution of human thought.”18Two months later, within days of the termination of his relationship withHammond, Tesla approached the new head of the House of Morgan with a proposal tohelp fund his bladeless turbines. “Its application to the manufacture of ironand steel, alone will yield $100,000,000 a year through the utilization of thewaste heat and other economies, and it will have a similar effect on shippropulsion, railroad, automobile and many other large industries.” The monarchlooked over the proposal and advanced the inventor $5,000.19It was a time for reflection on the death and transmutation of his nemesis.Conflicting emotions of enmity and adoration poured through his being intorrents as he relived the exhilaration of his wireless odyssey and the anguishof its incompleteness.On July 7, 1913, three days before his fifty-seventh birthday, Tesla took thetrain back out to Wardenclyffe. He had much to think about, for his friendJohnson had decided to retire from the Century. Overseers of the company werepressing to lower the standards. Johnson offered to create a separate magazine,which would be more flashy, but he wanted to maintain the integrity of theoriginal; but he was outvoted. “It was really pathetic to see the way authorswould plead with me for another ‘damn,’”20 he told his friend. Katharine becamemore persistent in demanding that Tesla stop by for another visit. Now infinancial trouble, his friends could even lose their house. Tesla tried toscurry past the magnifying transmitter without looking up, to get to the safe inthe laboratory, but he was drawn like a magnet to the stalwart frame. As hegrabbed a rung from the bottom tier, a sorrow swept through him that stole hisbreath. He staggered to the door of Stanny’s building and let himself in. “I didnot exactly cry when I saw my place after so long an interval,” he wroteScherff, “but came very near doing it.”21Tesla began to court the new Morgan, trying not to fall into the trap he hadlaid for himself the first time around. He sent Jack an articulate proposaloutlining his wireless enterprise and explanation of his outstanding debt andarrangement with his father and also his plans in the field of “fluidpropulsion,” that is, bladeless turbines.“In either of these fields in which I have the good fortune to be a pioneer thepossibilities are immense and I can vouch for the fullest success; but my appealfor your support is on a higher plane…The proposition which I would respectfullysubmit is to organize two companies and to turn over to you my entire interestsin both, of which you may accord me such a part as you deem best.”22“I’m greatly impressed with your offer,” Jack responded. “But of course I couldnot consent to doing as you suggest. I wish to make a counter offer, which isthat you should proceed to organize your companies, and, if and as they workout, repay to Mr. Morgan’s estate either in securities or in cash, the money Mr.Morgan advanced. It seems to me, that you are entitled to the profits of thesecompanies, but that Morgan would, in strict justice, be entitled to a return ofhis money if it could be arranged.”23Tesla left the meeting with the old itch reactivated and another check for$5,000. He thanked Jack for his encouragement and forwarded an open letter whichhe had written to His Grace, the Most Reverend Archbishop of Ireland. “The dayis not distant when the very planet which gave him birth, will tremble at thesound of his voice: he will…harness the inexhaustible…intense energy ofmicrocosmic movement, cause atoms to combine in predetermined forms; he willdraw the mighty ocean from its bed, transport it through the air and createlakes and rivers at will; he will command the wild elements; he will push onfrom great to greater deeds until with his intelligence and force he will reachout to spheres beyond the terrestrial.”24“It is now clear to me,” Tesla told the new J.P., “that you are moved by thesame great spirit of generosity which has animated your father and I am morethan ever desirous of enlisting your interest and support. Destiny has placedyou in a position of great power and influence and here is a wonderfulopportunity.“As for myself,” the modest inventor continued, “I contemplated more thanfinancial success…A great monument will no doubt be built to Mr. Morgan, butnone in marble or bronze could be as lasting as the achievement which I haveproposed to link with his memory.”25To reassert his dominance as the preeminent inventor in wireless, the inventorforwarded a transcript of the entire French litigation proceedings, whereinMarconi’s work was overturned in favor of his. If Jack could help fight thelegal battle in the United States, the wireless enterprise, which theycontractually shared, could be revived.Jack, however, was not smitten by the same vision of destiny and graciouslydeclined to become involved in Wardenclyffe in any way. He had not ruled out theturbines, however, and told the inventor to keep him informed of any progress.Tesla returned to the Edison Waterside Station with a new transfusion of 23 WallStreet blood. To reflect the reactivation of the resurrected alliance, theinventor set out to search for more fashionable chambers. Within a few months hetook up residence in the brand-new Woolworth Building. Decorated with agold-leafed emerald-colored mosaic ceiling in the lobby and located by cityhall, near Wall Street on Park Row, the gothicstyled Woolworth soared above thecity to the dizzying height of eight hundred feet, eclipsing the MetropolitanTowers as the loftiest skyscraper in the world. Tesla took the Johnsons along tothe gala opening. The banquet began with the illumination of the building’seighty thousand lightbulbs by President Woodrow Wilson, who pressed a button inWashington, D.C. Tesla met with the mayor, Mr. “Dime Store” Woolworth, and otherdignitaries, and then Katharine lured her two escorts into one of thetwenty-four high-speed elevators to the roof, where they could gaze out over thesprawling megalopolis.“Do not worry about finances, Luka,” Tesla said confidently. “Remember, whileyou sleep, I work and am solving your problems.” Johnson brought up the old ACpolyphase debacle, and Tesla replied that there were “billions invested [in it]now. I won every suit without exception and had it not been for a ‘scrap ofpaper,’ I would have received in royalties Rockefeller’s fortune, but just thesame, I feel I am safe to invite you to dinner.”Tesla’s wit and latest maneuver once again brought a needed smile to theoft-brooding Mrs. Filipov. As usual, when the wizard returned to her orb, sheseemed to step back from the veil. Johnson, however, reiterated his concern thatwithout a job, 327 Lexington Avenue could go on the market.“Please take my words seriously,” Tesla insisted. “Do not worry, and write yoursplendid poetry in perfect serenity. I will do away with all difficulties whichconfront you. Your talent cannot be turned into money, but mine is one which…canbe transformed into car-loads of gold. This is what I am doing now.”26 Duringthis period, Tesla continued to pay back monies owed the Johnsons as he laboredwith his new engines.Throughout the latter half of 1913, the inventor prepared a careful marketingplan to exploit his new device. Not only would he show Hammond that he had madea costly mistake, he would also set up an industry that would ensure thefinances necessary to return to his beloved Long Island tower. His best leadscame from the Ford Motor Company in the United States and the Bergmann Works inGermany.Tesla had known Sigmund Bergmann since his first days in America. Bergmann hademigrated from Germany even before Tesla and became a valued employee/privatepartner and manufacturer for Thomas Edison. Maintaining a separate company fromthe other Edison works, Bergmann became highly successful. He returned toGermany in the early 1900s, becoming one of the leading manufacturers for thekaiser,27 a man who had also attempted to woo the Serb, especially before theturn of the century, when he was demonstrating his fantastic inventions inEurope and America.In September, Tesla forwarded photographs of his turbines and invited Morgan tothe Waterside Station to see them in person; however, Morgan was sailing forEurope. “Perhaps when I return some time in December,” Morgan replied, “it willbe possible for me to go into the question.”28 While the new Wall Street czarsailed for the Old World, Tesla set up meetings with emissaries from the mostconsequential markets. In a letter sent to Morgan upon his return, Teslaoutlined his numerous strategies for achieving financial success. His listincluded:> 1.

Very good chance for big business.Manufacturing had begun at some of these places, and royalty contracts werenegotiated with most. “As you can see, Mr. Morgan, here are decidedly valuableresults very gratifying to me but, on the other hand, I am almost despairing atthe present state of things. I need money badly and I cannot get it in thesedreadful times. You are about the only man to whom I can look for help. I havestated my case.”29Morgan agreed to defer interest payments on the amount, which was now up to$20,000, but decided not to increase the loan. Tesla, however, simply requiredthe funds and followed up the letter with a testimonial from Excellenz vonTirpitz, minister of marine, “who has been requested to the German Emperorrelative to the Tesla Turbine who is greatly interested in this invention.” VonTirpitz had “promised his Excellency that the machine will certainly be here onexhibition about the middle of January, so you know what that means.” Tesla alsoinformed Morgan that if the deal was consummated, Bergmann would come throughwith royalties on the turbine of $100,000 per year.30Considering Jack’s keen antipathy for the Germans, their connection to theJewish banking houses (he was notoriously anti-Semitic), and the long-standingpolicy of the House of Morgan to shun financial arrangements with Germany afterthey had double-crossed Pierpont many years before, it would seem unlikely thatJack would reverse his decision. However, unlike his father, the son was able tocompromise and allow his heart to rule at times. He graciously changed his mindand forwarded the additional funds.31As Tesla awaited news from the Bergmann Works, he labored to perfect a newspeedometer he had invented. The device, much simpler than the one then beingused, would cost half as much to produce and had a market in the hundreds ofthousands. Considering that his selling price would be around twenty-fivedollars each, the potential for large profits was great, and Tesla offered thedeal to Morgan. Jack declined and asked again for the interest payment due onthe loan.“In the turbine proposition,” Tesla replied, “I have received a painful setback.I installed the machine at the Edison Plant and made some very gratifying tests,but soon discovered that the castings of the bearings were full of small holeswhich allowed the water to enter and made it hazardous to run.” Tesla had torenew the parts, “but spent considerably more money than expected.” He also hadlawyers fees to contend with because of the upcoming suit with Marconi, so herequested that Morgan either be patient or help with the bills to complete theturbine project or protect their other common interest.32Besides the deaths of Astor and Pierpont Morgan, this period also marked thedeparture of two other lions from Tesla’s den, George Westinghouse andnaturalist John Muir; both men died in 1914. Westinghouse’s death was cushionedby some weeks of declining health, but Muir’s passage took Tesla by surprise.“He seemed so vigorous in mind and body when I saw him not long ago,” thetechnological conservationist told the Johnsons.33 Only a few years before, thesky had been blanketed with hundreds of thousands of passenger pigeons, and thebeauty of nature had been rekindled with Muir’s inspirational writings. As Teslastrolled to his favorite spot by the Forty-second Street library to spread seedamong the bird’s domestic cousins and consider a new tack for instituting hiswireless scheme, the last passenger pigeon disappeared from the earth. JackMorgan spent time with one of the few Jews he liked, Daniel Guggenheim,organizing Kennecott Copper, “America’s biggest copper producer.”34Tesla sent his tribute to Westinghouse to Electrical World.

Roosevelt> Acting Secretary of the Navy1Within two weeks of the beginning of World War I, Germany’s transatlantic cablewas severed by the British. The only reasonable alternative for communicatingwith the outside world was through Telefunken’s wireless system. Suddenly, theTuckerton and Sayville plants became of paramount concern. The Germans obviouslywanted to maintain the stations to keep the kaiser abreast of President WoodrowWilson’s intentions, but the British wanted them shut down.In March 1914, Marconi was made a senatore in Italy, a distinguished man ofscience, and he spoke before the royal couple. In July in Great Britain, theland of his mother, he was decorated by the king at Buckingham Palace. Now thefight against Telefunken would be fought on military as well as commercialgrounds as it became clear that the Germans were using their plants to helpcoordinate submarine and battleship movements. The wireless lines also markedthe burgeoning alliance forming between Italy and the British Empire.2As a pacifist, Wilson maintained a strict policy of neutrality, a positionbolstered by war hero and former president Teddy Roosevelt, himself a contenderfor the upcoming 1916 election. Although officially neutral, the sentiments ofthe majority of the American population was with England, particularly afterGermany stormed through the peaceful kingdom of Belgium. Nevertheless, fullyone-tenth of the population was of German stock, and their sentiments were withthe other side. George Sylvester Viereck, the country’s leading poet, colleagueof Johnson, and Tesla friend, began to sense the growing shift away fromneutrality, especially after the U.S. Navy appropriated the Tuckerton plant tosend its own “radio coded messages abroad.”Having just returned from Berlin and the midst of war, Viereck courted TeddyRoosevelt and emissaries of President Wilson. Simultaneously, he began a newpublication with other leading German Americans. Initially welcomed by thepress, the Fatherland soon achieved a subscription base of 100,000.3Ignoring Viereck’s plea for neutrality, Wilson prepared a presidential decree“declaring that all radio stations within the jurisdiction of the United Statesof America were [to be] prohibited from transmitting or receiving…messages of anunneutral nature…By virtue of authority vested in me by the Radio Act,” thepresident continued, “one or more of the high powered radio stations within thejurisdiction of the United States…shall be taken over by the Government.”4Throughout the beginning of the war, Tesla stepped up his legal campaign againstMarconi and continued to advise and receive compensation from Telefunken. Sincethe country was officially neutral (America would not enter the war for anotherthree years), the arrangement was entirely aboveboard. Nevertheless, few peopleknew about the German-Tesla link, although the inventor made no secret of it toJack Morgan.> February 19, 1915> > Dear Mr. Morgan,> > I am expecting to embody in their plant at Sayville some features of my own> which will make it practicable to communicate with Berlin by wireless> telephone and then royalties will be very considerable. We have already drawn> papers.5Camouflaged by the smoke screen of the American-sounding Atlantic CommunicationCompany, Telefunken swiftly moved to increase the power of its remaining stationat Sayville. Located near the town of Patchogue out on the flats of Long Island,just a few miles from Wardenclyffe, the Sayville complex encompassed a hundredacres and employed many German workers. With its main offices in Manhattan andits German director, Dr. Karl George Frank, an American citizen, Telefunken waslegally covered, for no foreigner could own a license to operate a wirelessstation in the country. (Thus, Marconi also had an American affiliate.) It wasan easy matter for Tesla to confer with Atlantic in the city and also go out tothe site of the plant.Within two months of Tesla’s letter to Morgan, the plant at Sayville tripled itsoutput by erecting two more pyramid-shaped transmission towers, five hundredfeet tall. Utilizing Tesla’s theories on the importance of ground transmission,resonating accoutrements spread out over the land for thousands of more feet.Thus, by shifting emphasis away from aerial transmission, Telefunken’s outputwas boosted from 35 kilowatts to over 100, catapulting Germany into thenumber-one spot in the wireless race. The New York Times reported on their frontpage, “Few persons outside radio officials knew that Sayville was becoming oneof the most powerful transatlantic communicating stations in this part of theworld.”6TESLA SUES MARCONI ON WIRELESS PLANTAlleges That Important ApparatusInfringes Prior Rights7Calling wireless “the greatest of all inventions,” Tesla made an additionalappeal for legal assistance to Morgan. “Can you put yourself for a moment in myplace?” he wrote the financier. “Surely, you are too big a man to permit such anoutrage and historical crime to be perpetuated as is now being done by cunningpromoters.” Expecting to “receive satisfaction from the Government,” since theyhad installed “$10,000,000 of [his] apparatus,” the inventor also revealed that“the Marconi people approached me to join forces, but only in stock and this isnot acceptable.”8Again Morgan declined assistance in protecting their patents held in common. TheWall Street mogul, however, had not at all abandoned the field, for he wasfunding a college radio station near Boston at Tufts University.9The years preceding America’s entrance into World War I contained anoverwhelming quagmire of litigation involving most countries and virtually everymajor inventor in the wireless field. At about the time of Tesla’s breakup withHammond, Fritz Lowenstein, who was paying royalties to both men (and to Morgan,through Tesla), began installing wireless apparatus aboard navy ships. Althoughthe equipment was also being used by Hammond to test the guided missiles, thiswork was classified, and Hammond’s patents became immune from litigation.10image 20 [images/image-20.jpg]Tesla polyphase generator used by Westinghouse Electric and ManufacturingCompany to electrify the Chicago’s World Fair of 1893.image 21 [images/image-21.jpg]Tesla at his Houston Street laboratory in 1898 sending 500,000 volts through hisbody to light a wireless fluorescent light in a multiple-exposure photograph.(MetaScience Foundationimage 22 [images/image-22.jpg]The wizard at his Colorado Springs laboratory sitting among sixty-footelectrical sparks in this illustrious multiple-exposure photograph.

(Westinghouse Corporation)Aside from Tesla’s priority battle, Telefunken was also suing Marconi, who, inturn, was suing the U.S. Navy as well as Fritz Lowenstein for patentinfringement.During the following spring, Marconi was subpoenaed by Telefunken. Due to theimportance of the case, he sailed off for America on the Lusitania, arriving inApril 1915 to testify. “We sighted a German submarine periscope,” he toldastonished reporters and his friends at dockside.” As three merchant ships hadalready been torpedoed without warning by the German U-boats the month before,Marconi’s inflammatory assertion was not taken lightly.The Brooklyn Eagle reported that this suit brought “some of the world’s greatestinventors on hand to testify.”12 Declared a victor in the Lowenstein proceedingsby a Brooklyn district-court judge, Marconi clearly had the press behind him.Nevertheless, he was beaten by the navy in his first go-around with them,13 sothis case against Telefunken, with all the heavyweights in town, promised to beportentous. Once and for all, it appeared, the true legal rights would beestablished in America.Aside from Marconi, there was, for the defense, Columbia professor MichaelPupin, whose testimony was even quoted in papers in California. Withbraggadocio, Pupin declared, “I invented wireless before Marconi or Tesla, andit was I who gave it unreservedly to those who followed!”14 “Nevertheless,”Pupin continued, “it was Marconi’s genius who gave the idea to the world, and hetaught the world how to build a telegraphic practice upon the basis of thisidea. [As I did not take out patents on my experiments], in my opinion, thefirst claim for wireless telegraphy belongs to Mr. Marconi absolutely, and tonobody else.”15 Watching his fellow Serb upon the stand, Tesla’s jaw dropped sohard, it almost cracked upon the floor.When Tesla took the stand for Atlantic, he came with his attorney, Drury W.Cooper, of Kerr, Page & Cooper. Unlike Pupin, who could only state abstractlythat he was the original inventor, Tesla proceeded to explain in clear fashionall of his work from the years 1891-99. He documented his assertions withtranscripts from published articles, from the Martin text, and from publiclectures, such as his well-known wireless demonstration which he had presentedto the public in St. Louis in 1893. The inventor also brought along copies ofhis various requisite patents which he had created while working at his HoustonStreet lab during the years 1896-99.> COURT: What were the [greatest] distances between the transmitting and> receiving stations?> > TESLA: From the Houston laboratory to West Point, that is, I think, a distance> of about thirty miles.> > COURT: Was that prior to 1901?> > TESLA: Yes, it was prior to 1897…> > COURT: Was there anything hidden about [the uses of your equipment], or were> they open so that anyone could use them?> > TESLA: There were thousands of people, distinguished men of all kinds, from> kings and greatest artists and scientists in the world down to old chums of> mine, mechanics, to whom my laboratory was always open. I showed it to> everybody; I talked freely about it.16As virtually no one knew about the West Point experiment, this statement wassomewhat deceptive, although it was true that thousands of people had witnessedTesla’s other wireless experiments, such as in St. Louis in 1893. Referringexplicitly to Marconi’s system, having brought the Italian’s patent along withhis own, the inventor concluded:> TESLA: If you [examine these two diagrams]…you will find that absolutely not a> vestige of that apparatus of Marconi remains, and that in all the present> systems there is nothing but my four-tuned circuits.17Another jolt to Marconi came from John Stone Stone (his mother’s maiden name, bycoincidence, was also Stone). Having traveled with his father, a general in theUnion army, throughout Egypt and the Mediterranean as a boy, Stone was educatedas a physicist at Columbia University and Johns Hopkins University, where hegraduated in 1890. A research scientist for Bell Labs in Boston for many years,Stone had set up his own wireless concern in 1899. The following year, he filedfor a fundamental patent on tuning, which was allowed by the U.S. Patent Officeover a year before Marconi’s.18 Stone, who never considered himself the originalinventor of the radio, as president of the Institute of Radio Engineers andowner of a wireless enterprise, put together a dossier of inventor priorities in“continuous-wave radio frequency apparatus.” He wanted to determine for himselfthe etiology of the invention. Adorned in a formal suit, silk ascot, highstarched collar, and pince-nez attached by a ribbon to his neck, the worldlyaristocrat took the stand:> Marconi, receiving his inspiration from Hertz and Righi…[was] impressed with> the electric radiation aspect of the subject…and it was a long time before he> seemed to appreciate the real role of the earth…, though he early recognized> that the connection of his oscillator to the earth was very material> value…Tesla’s electric earth waves explanation was the more serviceable in> that it explained [how]…the waves were enabled to travel over and around hills> and were not obstructed by the sphericity of the earth’s surface, while> Marconi’s view led many to place an altogether too limited scope to the> possible range of transmission…With the removal of the spark gap from the> antenna, the development of earthed antenna, and the gradual enlargement of> the size of stations…greater range could be obtained with larger power used at> lower frequencies, [and] the art returned to the state to which Tesla> developed it.Attributing the opposition, and alas, even himself, to having been afflictedwith “intellectual myopia,” Stone concluded that although he had been designingwireless equipment and running wireless companies since the turn of the century,it wasn’t until he “commenced with this study” that he really understood Tesla’s“trail blazing” contribution to the development of the field. “I think we allmisunderstood Tesla,” Stone concluded. “He was so far ahead of his time that thebest of us mistook him for a dreamer.”19Another case which did not receive much publicity but which became vital to theSupreme Court’s 1943 ruling in Tesla’s favor, was Marconi v. U.S. Navy, broughtJuly 29, 1916, two years after their first go-around. The Italian was seeking$43,000 in damages, suing for infringement of fundamental wireless patent no.763,772, which had been allowed in June 1904.E. F. Sweet, acting secretary of the navy, and also Assistant Secretary FranklinD. Roosevelt began a correspondence in September to review Tesla’s 1899 file tothe Light House Board.20 The history of Marconi’s patent applications to theU.S. Patent Office provided additional ammunition. In 1900, John Seymour, thecommissioner of patents, who had protected Tesla against the demands of MichaelPupin for an AC claim at this same time, disqualified Marconi’s first attemptsat achieving a patent because of prior claims of Lodge and Braun andparticularly Tesla. “Marconi’s pretended ignorance of the nature of a ‘Teslaoscillator’ [is] little short of absurd,” wrote the commissioner. “Ever sinceTesla’s famous [1891-93 lectures]…widely published in all languages, the term‘Tesla oscillator’ has become a household word on both continents.” The patentoffice also cited quotations from Marconi himself admitting use of a Teslaoscillator.Two years later, in 1902, Stone was granted his patent on tuning which thegovernment cited as anticipating Marconi, and two years after that, afterSeymour retired, Marconi was granted his infamous 1904 patent.21EDWIN ARMSTRONG“I have had a lot of fun at Columbia,” Armstrong said. The lecturer in physicsthat semester loftily disparaged the experiments of Nikola Tesla. “He even wentso far as to say that there was very little originality about Tesla.” Ever theaudacious student, Armstrong used the professor’s ignorance of Tesla’s teachingsto cause the man to receive a hearty shock from some electrical equipment. “Hecouldn’t let go, and pulled most of the apparatus off the table before thecurrent was turned off.”22Just after graduation, Armstrong invented a feedback amplifier, which was, inessence, a refinement and further development of De Forest’s audion tube.Influenced by the “Edison effect” or flow of electrons studied by Tesla in theearly 1890s in his “brush” vacuum tube, Armstrong had discovered a way to takethe De Forest audion and amplify its sensitivity and boost its power to anothermagnitude by connecting a second circuit, or wing circuit, to the grid insidethe tube and feeding it back into the grid. The end result was that with thisnew invention the young whippersnapper could pick up wireless messages from NovaScotia, Ireland, Germany, San Francisco, and even Honolulu.As Armstrong was one of Professor Pupin’s star pupils, Pupin was able to set upmeetings with Lee De Forest, David Sarnoff, representing Marconi Wireless, andDr. Karl Frank, head of the Atlantic Communication Company. Since De Forest’saudion lay at the center of the new device, De Forest claimed the “ultra-audion”as his own invention, so Marconi Wireless stepped aside to wait for the dust tosettle. Frank, on the other hand, had Armstrong put the equipment into thewireless plant at Sayville and paid him a royalty of $100 per month.23 Destinedto invent AM and FM radio and a nonconformist by nature, this new wizard on theblock had come upon his 1912 discovery because he had rejected the inferiorMarconi spark-gap apparatus that most of his wireless buddies were still playingwith and, like Stone, plunged himself into the continuous-wave technologydeveloped by Tesla.With Professor Pupin training many of the new breed of electrical engineers, itis no wonder that few of them would have the gumption of an Armstrong to seethat Marconi’s success was based on the work of another and, furthermore, thatMarconi succeeded in spite of the fact that he only partially understood whatTesla had attempted. Blinded by the Hertzian spark-gap research, Marconi spreadhis “myopic vision” through Pupin to the vast hordes of researchers in the fieldof wireless; and this policy has continued to this day. With Marconi’s highlyvisible early success, large-scale wireless enterprise, and Nobel Prize on hisside of the balance, it became much easier to credit him with the discovery. Theongoing Great War served to further cloud the issue, as the important legalbattle between Atlantic Cable Company (Telefunken) and Marconi Wireless wasabandoned before it was resolved.Due to the dangers that existed on the high seas, and the rumors that theGermans were out for Marconi’s head, the senatore did not sail back on theLusitania; he returned on the St. Paul with a disguised identity and under anassumed name.Marconi set sail as the new head of the AIEE, John S. Stone, was honored at adinner attended by a potpourri of leaders in the industry. Guests included LeeDe Forest, who was about to receive a quarter of a million dollars for sale ofhis patents to AT&T, J. A. White, editor of Wireless magazine; David Sarnoff, onthe verge of launching his radio empire; Rudolf Goldschmidt, the force behindthe Tuckerton plant; A. E. Kennelly; Fritz Lowenstein, who was about to earn$150,000 from AT&T for one of his inventions; and Nikola Tesla, who stoodbetween De Forest and Lowenstein for an official photograph.24A fortnight later; in May 1915, a German submarine torpedoed the Lusitania,killing 1,134 persons. The sinking, in lieu of the alternative procedure ofboarding unarmed passenger ships to check cargo, was unheard of. Quite possibly,Marconi could have been a target; however, the Germans used as their reason thecargo of armaments onboard headed for Great Britain. With only 750 survivors,this “turkey shoot” took almost as many lives as the sinking of the Titanic.According to Lloyd Scott of the Navy Consulting Board, “press reports statedthat the Germans seemed to revel in this crime, and that various celebrationswere held in Germany on account of it. Medals were being struck to commemoratethe sinking, and holidays were given to school children.”25 No longer neutral,Teddy Roosevelt hailed the event as “murder on the open seas.”The huge loss of life, however, did not stop George Sylvester Viereck fromsupporting the German position. Having traveled by zeppelin above Berlin duringthe war, Viereck stated in the New York Times that had the weapons made it toEngland, “more Germans would have been killed than died in the [boat] attack.”Viereck’s callous argument inflamed the populace against him. The formerrenowned poet was now hailed as “a venom-bloated toad of treason.”26The enemy seemed within. German spies were everywhere. Reports started filteringin that the Germans were creating a secret submarine base around islands off thecoast of Maine. It was also alleged that the broadcasting station out atSayville was not merely sending neutral dispatches to Berlin but also codedmessages to battleships and submarines.As Tesla, just a few months earlier, had boasted to Morgan that he was workingfor the Germans and with the Times reporting on their front page that “GrandAdmiral von Tirpitz [was] contemplat[ing] a more vigorous campaign againstfreight ships…[and planning] a secret base on this side of the Atlantic,”27 itis quite possible that the inventor became tainted with a smattering of“venom-bloated toad’s blood.”On July 2, 1915, the senate chambers in Washington were rocked by a terroristbomb. The following day, the fanatic who planted it, Frank Holt, a teacher ofGerman from Cornell University, walked into Jack Morgan’s Long Island hometoting a six-gun in each hand. With his wife and daughter leaping at theassailant, Morgan charged forward. Shot twice in the groin, Morgan was able,with the help of his fearsome wife, to wrestle the guns from the man and get himarrested. Recuperating at the hospital, the hero received a get-well letter fromNikola Tesla.28When questioned, Holt claimed he had not planned to kill the Wall Streetmonarch. He only wanted the financier to stop the flow of arms to Europe. A fewdays later, as Morgan recovered quickly and fired all German and Austrianworkers from his office, the self-righteous pacifist committed suicide in hisjail cell. His secret had been unveiled. Holt’s real name was Dr. Erich Muenter;he was a former German teacher from Harvard who had disappeared after murderinghis wife with poison in 1906.29A week later, on Tesla’s fifty-ninth birthday, the Times reported that not onlywere the Germans dropping bombs over London from zeppelins; they were also“controlling air torpedoes” by means of radiodynamics. Fired from zeppelins, thesupposed “German aerial torpedo[es] can theoretically remain in the air threehours, and can be controlled from a distance of two miles…Undoubtedly, this isthe secret invention of which we have heard so many whispers that the Germanshave held in reserve for the British fleet.”30 Although it seemed as if Tesla’sdevil automata had come into being, as the wizard had predicted a decade before,Tesla himself announced to the press that “the news of these magic bombs cannotbe accepted as true, [though] they reveal just so many startling possibilities.”“Aghast at the pernicious existing regime of the Germans,” Tesla accused Germanyof being an “unfeeling automaton, a diabolic contrivance for scientific,pitiless, wholesale destruction the like of which was not dreamed of before…Suchis the formidable engine Germany has perfected for the protection of her Kulturand conquest of the globe.” Predicting the ultimate defeat of the fatherland,the Serb, whose former countrymen were fighting for their own survival againstthe kaiser, no doubt stopped doing business with von Tirpitz, although heprobably continued his relationship with Professor Slaby, who may have beenmorally opposed to the war.Tesla’s solution to war was twofold, a better defense, through an electronicStar Wars type of shield he was working on, and “the eradication from our heartsof nationalism.” If blind patriotism could be replaced with “love of nature andscientific ideal…permanent peace [could] be established.”31The period from 1915 to the date of the United States entry into the war, in1917, was marked by numerous reports of espionage. Spies had infiltrated theBrooklyn Navy Yard to use the station to send secret coded messages to Berlin;through Richard Pfund, head of the Sayville plant, they had also installedequipment on the roof of 111 Broadway, the building that housed Telefunken’soffices.32 Shortly after America’s entrance into the war, Tesla informed Scherffthat Lt. Emil Meyers, “who ran the Tuckerton operation…[had been placed] in aDetention Camp in Georgia,” suspected of spying.33 Thus, the monthly stipendfrom Telefunken had come to an abrupt end.34The secretary of the navy, whose job it became to take over all wirelessstations, was Josephus Daniels; his assistant was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Inthe summer of 1915, Daniels, who was actively monitoring Jack Hammond’s work,had read a recent interview with Thomas Alva Edison. Impressed with thecontents, the secretary called Edison and set up a meeting with the idea ofcreating an advisory board of inventors. The hope was that should the country goto war, a civilian think tank, much like the one created in Great Britain, couldbe created. (Great Britain’s consulting board included J. J. Thomson, W. H.Bragg, Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge, and Ernest Rutherford.) Edison,who himself had received death threats from the fifth column, became presidentof this “Naval Consultant Board.” Working with Franklin Roosevelt, Edisonappointed numerous inventors to various positions, including Gano Dunne,Reginald Fessenden, Benjamine Lamme, Irving Langmuir, R. A. Millikan, MichaelPupin, Charles S. Scott, Elmer Sperry, Frank Sprague, and Elihu Thomson. Thejournalist Waldemar Kaempffert was also included because of his writingprowess.35It is possible that Tesla’s link to Telefunken was the reason his name was noton the list, although many other inventors were also excluded, for example,Hammond, Stone, and De Forest. Tesla also was not one to work again for ThomasEdison. Tesla’s work, however, was obviously vital to the government. WithPresident Wilson allowing his adviser, Col. William House, to set up a secretfund for Hammond to advance the Tesla inventions, Tesla himself slipped into amore surreptitious realm.36"},{"pageContent":"41THE INVISIBLE AUDIENCE (1915-21) [002-toc.html#ch41]> Dear Tesla,> > When that Nobel Prize comes, remember that I am holding on to my house by the> skin of my teeth and desperately in need of cash!> > No apology for mentioning the matter.> > Yours faithfully,> RUJ1On November 6, 1915, the New York Times published on its front page that Teslaand Edison were to share the Nobel Prize in physics that year. The source forthe report was “the Copenhagen correspondent of the [London] Daily Telegraph.”Although Tesla himself forwarded to J. P. Morgan Jr. original copies of theannouncement (which were also carried in a number of other journals),2 neitherTesla nor Edison ever received the Nobel Prize.In trying to ascertain what happened, Tesla biographers Inez Hunt and WanettaDraper wrote in the early 1960s to Dr. Rudberg of the Royal Academy of Scienceof Sweden. Rudberg, referring to an event which took place a half centurybefore, replied, “Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prizebecause he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous.”Thus, they concluded that the affair was “a sardonic joke.”3Curiously, this same Times article listed four other people for Nobel Prizes inliterature and chemistry who also did not receive the award that year, althoughthree of them eventually obtained it. The fourth, Troeln Lund, like Tesla andEdison, never received the honor.4Although the announcement came in November 1915, the nomination process actuallywas concluded nine months earlier. There were nineteen scientists on the physicscommittee, each allowed two bids. Out of the thirty-eight possible bids, twowere made for inventors in wireless, E. Branly and A. Righi; two were for thequantum physicist Max Planck; Tom Edison received one bid; and the Braggs tookfour. According to the Royal Academy’s records, Nikola Tesla was not nominatedthat year. (However, two bids, nos. 33 and 34, were missing from their files.) Aweek after the Times announcement, on November 14, Stockholm announced thatProf. William H. Bragg and his son would share the award in physics.The man who nominated Edison, Henry Fairfield Osborn, president of ColumbiaUniversity (who, twenty years before, had awarded Tesla an honorary doctorate),apologized to the committee for offering up Edison’s name. “Although somewhatout of the line of previous nominations,” Osborn wrote, qualifying hisdecision,” I would [like to] suggest the name of Mr. Thomas A. Edison…who isthrough his inventions, one of the great benefactors of mankind.” Tesla wouldnot be nominated until 1937 (by F. Ehrenhaft of Wien, who had previouslynominated Albert Einstein).5Certainly, both Tesla and Edison deserved such an award, and it is nothing shortof astounding that (1) neither of them ever received it and (2) no one at thetime discovered the reason behind this curious quirk of history.O’Neill, having interviewed Tesla on the subject, stated that Tesla “made adefinite distinction between the inventor, who refined preexisting technology,and the discoverer who created new principles…Tesla declared himself adiscoverer and Edison an inventor; and he held the view that placing the two inthe same category would completely destroy all sense of the relative value ofthe two accomplishments.”6Support for this interpretation can be found in a letter Tesla wrote to theLight House Board in Washington from his Colorado Springs Experimental Stationin 1899. The navy had written Tesla that they would “prefer” to give theirimpending wireless contract to an American rather than to Marconi.“Gentleman,” Tesla responded curtly. “Much as I value your advances I amcompelled to say, in justice to myself, that I would never accept a preferenceon any ground…as I would be competing against some of those who are following inmy path…Any pecuniary advantage which I might derive by availing myself of theprivilege, is a matter of the most absolute indifference to me.”7 If no one elsewould recognize his genius, Tesla certainly did. He would not think twice aboutgiving up mere cash when faced with the prospect of being compared, in this caseto Marconi.The following letter to Johnson, which the inventor took the time to rewrite ina careful hand, was penned just four days after the announcement and four daysbefore Sweden’s decision to give the award to the Braggs.> My dear Luka,> > Thank you for your congratulations…To a man of your consuming ambition such a> distinction means much. In a thousand years there will be many thousand> recipients of the Nobel Prize. But I have not less than four dozen of my> creations identified with my name in technical literature. These are honors> real and permanent which are bestowed not by a few who are apt to err, but by> the whole world which seldom makes a mistake, and for any of these I would> give all the Nobel Prizes which will be distributed during the next thousand> years.8This passage was contained in its entirety in the Hunt and Draper text; however,they incorrectly concluded that this “sober” message was overshadowed by“jubilation” because of the announcement.9 Johnson also incorrectly understoodthe full implication of the letter, because in March 1916 he refers to theaward, fully expecting Tesla to receive it.10In the New York Times interview on the day following their announcement, Teslastated that Edison was “worthy of a dozen Nobel Prizes.” The various Teslabiographers assumed that this was a public statement congratulating Edison when,in fact, it was a piquant snub to the Nobel committee. Tesla was stating betweenthe lines that the Nobel committee recognized only small accomplishments ratherthan truly original conceptualizations.“A man puts in here [in my Tesla coil] a kind of gap—he gets a Nobel Prize fordoing it…I cannot stop it.”11 Thus, Edison’s many “better mousetraps” could allbe honored, but none of them, in Tesla’s opinion, concerned the creation of newprinciples. They were simply refinements of existing apparatus.Edison would probably have agreed with Tesla on this point, for most of hisinventions were actually further developments of other people’s work. However,Edison did have a number of original discoveries and creations. In his ownopinion, his most important contribution was the phonograph, which certainly wasthe work of genius, even by Tesla’s criteria, and deserving of a Nobel Prize.Furthermore, Edison’s unparalleled success in bringing promising creations tofruition was exactly Tesla’s failure, and that, too, was a gift placing Edisonin a category all by himself.Quite possibly a letter much like the one sent to Johnson or the Light HouseBoard could also have been wired to the Nobel committee. If this hypothesis iscorrect, a prejudice would have persisted against Tesla and Edison, and thiswould explain the indefensible position of the Swedish Royal Academy in neverhonoring either of these two great scientists.WIZARD SWAMPED BY DEBTSInventor Testifies He Owes the WaldorfHasn’t a Cent in Bank12As 1915 was drawing to a close, Tesla began to find himself in deeper and deeperfinancial straits. Although an efficient water fountain which he designed thatyear was received favorably,13 his overhead was still too high. Expensesincluded outlays for the turbine work at the Edison Station, his office space atthe Woolworth Building, salaries to his assistants and Mrs. Skerritt, his newsecretary, past debts to such people as the Johnsons and George Scherff,maintenance costs for Wardenclyffe, legal expenses on wireless litigation, andhis accommodations at the Waldorf-Astoria.Some of the costs were deferred, particularly by the hotel, but Mr. Boldt’spatience had reached its limit. Tesla’s uncanny elusiveness and noble air hadworn thin. Rumors began circulating of peculiar odors and cackling soundsemanating from the inventor’s suite. The maids were complaining that there wasan inordinate amount of pigeon excrement on the windowsills. Boldt sent Tesla abill for the total rent due, nearly $19,000. Simultaneously, Tesla was hit witha suit for $935 for taxes still owed on Wardenclyffe.Tesla signed over the Wardenclyffe property to Boldt just as he was called intothe state supreme court. Before Justice Finch, the inventor revealed that “hepossessed no real estate or stocks and that his belongings, all told, werenegligible.” Under oath, Tesla revealed that he lived at the prestigious Waldorf“mostly on credit,” that his company “had no assets but is receiving enoughroyalties on patents to pay expenses,” and that most of his patents were sold orassigned to other companies. When asked if he owned an automobile or horses, theinventor responded no.“Well, haven’t you got any jewelry?”“No jewelry; I abhor it.”11This embarrassing article was published for all to see in the World. Yet, as washis custom with any article about himself, the inventor had his secretary pastethe mea culpa in the latest volume of press clippings. Looking much like amultivolume encyclopedia, this text, along with his other records andcorrespondence, would provide for posterity an accurate account of theinventor’s rich and complicated life. The inventor had chosen his wordscarefully when speaking under oath to the judge. As much as he loathed being ina debtor’s position, he wanted the Morgans, Marconis, Franklin Roosevelts, andWoodrow Wilsons to know of his plight, for in the final analysis this shamewould be theirs as much as his. Even T. C. Martin had turned against him,writing petty letters to Elihu Thomson at this time, complaining of how Teslachiseled money out of him for the opus he had created of the inventor’scollected works a generation ago.15Attempting to raise funds in a variety of ways, Tesla continued to try to markethis speedometer, push to get monies from American firms for the bladelessturbines, and collect royalty payments from Lowenstein and Telefunken for theTuckerton and Sayville plants. The elder statesman of invention also continuedto write newspaper articles for the World and the Sun for ready cash, and healso moved to exploit other creations, such as his electrotherapeutic machines,with Dr. Morrell. Tesla wrote Scherff that he expected the medical market to be$3-$4 million.16The publication of his wretched state in the public forum and the transfer ofWardenclyffe to another party produced in Tesla a deep sense of anger andcorresponding shame; for now the world had officially branded him a dud. Ifsuccess is measured in a material way, it was clear that Tesla was the ultimatefailure.On the exterior, the inventor kept up appearances, but this event would mark theturning point in his life. Now he began the slow but steady turning away fromsociety. Simultaneously, he traveled to live in other states, in part to conductbusiness in a fresh atmosphere and in part to remove himself from a hostileenvironment. He wrote a letter to Henry Ford in Detroit, hoping, finally, thatthe auto magnate would recognize the great advantages of his steam engine.“I can tell, any day, that Ford is going to contact me, and take me out of allmy worries,” Tesla confidently predicted to Julius Czito, Coleman’s son, who wasnow working for him. “Sure enough, one fine morning a body of engineers from theFord Motor Company presented themselves with the request of discussing with mean important project,” Tesla revealed a few years later.“Didn’t I tell you,” the prophet remarked triumphantly.“You are amazing, Mr. Tesla,” Julius responded. “Everything is coming out justas you predicted.”“As soon as these hardheaded men were seated,” Tesla continued, “I, of course,immediately began to extol the wonderful features of my turbine, when thespokesmen interrupted me and said, ‘We know all about this, but we are on aspecial errand. We have formed a psychological society for the investigation ofpsychic phenomena and we want you to join us in this undertaking.’”Flabbergasted, Tesla contained his indignation long enough to escort the waywardexplorers to the street.17A MEETING WITH A PRINCESSSuffering from an attack of the grippe throughout the first month of 1916, Teslamade the newspapers by posing for a portrait for the provocative painterPrincess Vilna Lwoff-Parlaghy. Daughter of Baroness von Zollerndorff and marriedand divorced from Prince Lwoff of Russia, Vilna had painted the portraits ofsuch greats as Field Marshall von Moltke, Bismarck, the Baroness Rothschild,Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, and Teddy Roosevelt. Reluctant at first to sitbecause of superstitious feelings of foreboding, Tesla soon acquiesced and founda comfortable chair among Her Highness’s various pets, which included, at onetime or another, “two dogs, an Angora cat, a bear, lion cub, alligator, ibis andtwo falcons.” Recently kicked out of the Plaza for unpaid bills totaling$12,000, perhaps the princess shared a good laugh with the Serbian nobleman, whohimself was in a similar predicament. The painting was reproduced in ElectricalExperimenter in 1919 and, once again, on the cover of Time for Tesla’sseventy-fifth birthday, in 1931.18This time period also saw the arrival of Tesla’s sister’s son, NicholasTrbojevich, himself an inventor who wanted to work as Tesla’s assistant.Apparently, Tesla was unable to spend much time with his nephew. Feelingrebuked, Trbojevich turned to the local Serbian community, where he found awilling Prof. Michael Pupin, who took the lad “under his wing” and on a tour ofthe city. Trbojevich endeared himself to the great professor and they becamefriends. Trbojevich would come to develop, in the 1920s and 1930s the hypoidgear and several sophisticated improvements in steering for the automotiveindustry. Working with mathematical principles, this inventor designed anelegant way to lower the driveshaft, running from the motor to the rear axle,nearly a foot. This advance enabled running boards to be eliminated, therebyallowing the car to become more streamlined. Simultaneously, it earnedTrbojevich a tidy sum. Moving to Detroit in the late 1920s, Trbojevich continuedto correspond with Uncle Nikki, who also came to visit around the time of theGreat Depression.19In February, Tesla received a letter from ardent admirer John (Jack) O’Neill,who was now working as a news correspondent for a Long Island daily and about totransfer jobs to the Herald Tribune. The young man reminded him of their 1907encounter in the subway and enclosed the following poem, “To Nikola Tesla,” asan “infinitesimal tribute to [the inventor’s] greatness”:> Most glorious man of all ages> Thou wert born to forecast greater days> Where the wonders thy magic presages> Shall alter our archaic ways.> > > > Your coils with their juice oscillating> Sent electrical surges through the earth> Sent great energies reverberating> From the center to the outermost girth.> > > > Is thy mind a power omnipresent> That fathoms the depths of all space> That speaks to an adolescent> The future triumphs of the race?20Tesla sent the youngster a letter in return “thanking him heartily,” although“your opinion of me is immensely exaggerated.” Enigmatically, he also suggestedthat O’Neill write a poem for J. Pierpont Morgan, “one man today on whom theworld is depending more than any other.” Should O’Neill do this, “it might beinstrumental in putting [him] in possession of a check.”21 Considering thatPierpont was dead, this was a rather peculiar recommendation.> THE EDISON MEDAL> > Were we to seize and to eliminate from our industrial world the results of Mr.> Tesla’s work, the wheels of industry would cease to turn, our towns would be> dark, our mills would be dead and idle. Ye[s], so far reaching is this work,> that it has become the warp and woof of industry.> > B. A. Behrend, 191722To those with eyes for the truth, Tesla’s state of crisis cut deep. One engineerin particular, Bernard A. Behrend, the Swiss émigré who had refused to testifyagainst him during the malevolent AC-patent litigation days, felt the urgency toact. Clearly, it was Behrend’s goal to help restore the reputation of hisspiritual benefactor. Having devoted a large measure of his life to refiningTesla’s invention of the induction motor, Behrend informed his mentor that he,Tesla, had been nominated to receive the Edison Medal. In fact, it had beenBehrend who had proposed the idea to the committee. Winners from the past hadincluded Alexander Graham Bell, Elihu Thomson, and George Westinghouse.That Tesla would be nominated by an organization dwelling under the banner ofthe Edison name was shocking enough to the brooding Serb. Edison himself musthave allowed the presentation to be made. It does not appear that Edison, havingjust turned seventy, was plagued by the reciprocal feeling of animosity thatTesla exhibited. It is more likely that the thought of giving Tesla the medalbrought a broad smirk to the Menlo Park Wizard’s visage.Tesla’s first reaction was abhorrence, and he flatly rejected the offer, butBehrend persisted. Here was an opportunity to recognize a worthy recipient alonefor his singular contributions. “Who do you want remembered as the author ofyour power system?” Behrend inquired. “Ferraris, Shallenberger, Stillwell, orSteinmetz?” Tesla reluctantly capitulated.The presentation of the Edison Medal was made on May 18, 1917, just two monthsbefore Tesla found out by telephone that vandals had broken into hisWardenclyffe laboratory and wrecked equipment valued at $68,000 and that “theTower [was] to be destroyed by dynamite.”23 Many familiar faces dotted thecrowd.The Johnsons and Miss Merrington attended, as did Charles Scott and EdwardDean Adams, the man most responsible for recommending Tesla for the NiagaraFalls enterprise.The opening speech was delivered by A. E. Kennelly, former Edison crony, who wasnow teaching at Harvard. Long a Tesla adversary, having been active in executinganimals with AC current during the heated Battle of the Currents in the early1890s, Kennelly spoke for fifteen minutes. During this time, the good professormanaged to not mention Tesla’s name even once.“Many people,” Professor Kennelly began, “suppose that the Edison Medal ispresented by Mister Edison, but that is a mistake. In fact, Tom Edison has beenso busy during his life receiving medals that he has not time to dispense any.”The speaker droned on, making Tesla more nervous with each obsequious sentence.“Every time a worthy recipient is honored with this Medal, Thomas Edison is alsohonored. In fact,” the Edison man continued, “We may look forward to a time, saya thousand years hence, when like this evening the one thousand and seventhrecipient will receive the Edison Medal, and once again Edison’s achievementswill be honored.”24As legend has it, Tesla disappeared from the room. Panic-stricken, Behrend ranout of the building to look for him, while Charles Terry, a prominent executivefrom the Westinghouse Corporation, reviewed Tesla’s great accomplishments.According to the story, Behrend found the lonely inventor across the street bythe library, feeding his precious pigeons.25During Behrend’s introduction, he stated, perhaps to counter Kennelly’s openingspeech, “The name of Tesla runs no more risk of oblivion than does that ofFaraday or Edison. What can a man desire more than this. It occurs to me toparaphrase Pope describing Newton, ‘Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night.God said, “Let Tesla be,” and all was light.’”“Ladies and gentleman,” Tesla began, “I wish to thank you heartily for your kindappreciation. I am not deceiving myself in the fact of which you must be awarethat the speakers have greatly magnified my modest achievements. Inspired withthe hope and conviction that this is just a beginning, a forerunner of stillgreater accomplishments, I am determined to continue developing my plans andundertake new endeavors.“I am deeply religious at heart, and give myself to the constant enjoyment ofbelieving that the greatest mysteries of our being are still to be fathomed.Evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, death itself may not be thetermination of the wonderful metamorphosis we witness. In this way I manage tomaintain an undisturbed peace of mind, to make myself proof against adversity,and to achieve contentment and happiness to a point of extracting somesatisfaction even from the darker side of life, the trials and tribulations ofexistence.”The electrical savant would go on to review much of his life—an anecdote fromhis childhood about a gander who almost pulled his umbilical cord out, his earlymeetings with Edison and work with Westinghouse, lectures in Europe, success atNiagara, and future plans in wireless.“I have fame and untold wealth, more than this,” the inventor concluded, “andyet—how many articles have been written in which I was declared to be animpractical unsuccessful man, and how many poor, struggling writers have calledme a visionary. Such is the folly and shortsightedness of the world!”26Tesla was aghast that Boldt had not protected Wardenclyffe adequately, for itwas valued at a minimum of at least $150,000. Even though he had signed it overto the hotel, he had done so, according to his understanding, to honor his debt“until [his] plans matured.” As the property, when completed, would yield$20,000 or $30,000 a day, Tesla was simply flabbergasted that Boldt would moveto destroy the place. Boldt or “the Hotel Management” saw Wardenclyffe now astheirs, free and clear, even though Tesla offered as proof “a chattel mortgage”on the machinery that the inventor had placed at his own expense. The hotel’sinsurance was only $5,000, whereas Tesla’s coverage for the machinery was valuedat $68,000. Why would Tesla independently seek to protect the property if hedidn’t still have an interest in it? Tesla saw the contract as “a securitypledge,” but the paper he signed did not specify any such contingency. Accordingto the Hotel’s lawyer, Frank Hutchins of Baldwin & Hutchins, “it was bill ofsale with the deed duly recorded two years ago. We fail to see what interest youhave,” Hutchins callously concluded.27Storming into their offices on Pine Street, Tesla demanded to find out firsthandwhat was to happen.“You will have to ask Smiley Steel Company. They are the ones in charge ofsalvage operations.”J. B. Smiley informed Tesla that indeed the tower was to be taken down, itsparts sold to cover outstanding debts. “A great wrong has been done,” theinventor wrote in reply, “but I am confident that justice will prevail.”28“Pay no attention to Tesla whatsoever, but proceed immediately with wrecking ascontracted,” Smiley told his wrecking crew after conferring with Hutchins.29> Waldorf-Astoria Hotel Company> > July 12, 1917> > Gentlemen:> > I have received reports which have completely dumbfounded me all the more so> as I am now doing important work for the Government with a view of putting the> plant to a special use of great moment…> > I trust that you will appreciate the seriousness of the situation and will see> that the property is taken good care of and that all apparatus is carefully> preserved.> > Very truly yours,> N. Tesla30The wizard decided that the only way to save Wardenclyffe was to extol itsvirtues as a potential defensive weapon for the protection of the country.Capitalizing on the excellent Nobel Prize publicity, the inventor once againstrained the reader’s credulity with another startling vision.> TESLA’S NEW DEVICE> LIKE BOLTS OF THOR> > He Seeks to Patent Wireless> Engine for Destroying Navies> by Pulling a Lever> > > TO SHATTER ARMIES ALSO> > Nikola Tesla, the inventor, winner of the 1915 Nobel Physics Prize, has filed> patent applications on the essential parts of a machine the possibilities of> which test a layman’s imagination and promise a parallel to Thor’s shooting> thunderbolts from the sky to punish those who had angered the gods.

This was his last chance to protect hiswireless patents and save the tower. “Words cannot express how much I havedeplored the cruel necessity which compelled me to appeal to you again,” theinventor explained, but it was to no avail.32 He still owed Jack $25,000 plusinterest; the financier ignored the entreaty and quietly placed Tesla’s accountin a bad-debt file.In February 1917, the United States broke off all relations with Germany andseized the wireless plant at Sayville. “Thirty German employees of theGerman-owned station were suddenly forced to leave, and enlisted men of theAmerican Navy have filled their places.”33 Guards were placed around the plantas the high command decided what to do with the remaining broadcasting stationslying along the coast. Articles began springing up like early crocus to announcethe potential “existence of [yet another] concealed wireless station [able] tosupply information to German submarines regarding the movements of ships.”34> 19 MORE TAKEN AS GERMAN SPIES> > Dr. Karl George Frank, Former> Head of Sayville Wireless> Among Those Detained35On April 6, 1917, President Wilson issued a proclamation “seiz[ing] all radiostations. Enforcement of the order was delegated to Secretary Daniels…It isunderstood that all plants for which no place can be found in the navy’swireless system, including amateur apparatus, for which close search will bemade, are to be put out of commission immediately.”36 Clearly, an overt decisionhad to be made about the fate of Wardenclyffe.Tesla’s expertise was well known to Secretary Daniels and Assistant SecretaryFranklin Roosevelt, as they were actively using the inventor’s scientific legacyas ammunition against Marconi in the patent suit. Coupled with the inventor’sastonishing proclamation that his tower could provide an electronic aegisagainst potential invasions, Wardenclyffe must have been placed in a specialcategory. However, there were two glaring strikes against it. The first was thatTesla had already turned over the property to Mr. Boldt to cover his debt at theWaldorf; and the second was the transmitter’s record of accomplishment:nonexistent. What better indication of the folly of Tesla’s dream could there bethen the tower’s own perpetual state of repose. To many, Wardenclyffe was merelya torpid monument to the bombastic prognostications of a not very original mindgone astray. From the point of view of the navy, Tesla may have been theoriginal inventor of the radio, but he was clearly not the one who made theapparatus work.A HISTORY OF NAVY INVOLVEMENTIn 1899 the U.S. Navy, via Rear Admiral Francis J. Higginson, requested Tesla toplace “a system of wireless telegraphy upon Light-Vessel No. 66 [on] NantucketShoals, Mass, which lies 60 miles south of Nantucket Island.”37 Tesla was on hisway to Colorado and was unable to comply. Moreover, the navy did not want to payfor the equipment, but rather wanted Tesla to lay out the funds himself.Considering the great wealth of the country, Tesla feigned astonishment at thepenurious position of John D. Long, secretary of the navy, via Commander Perry,who brazenly forwarded the financial disclaimer on U.S. Treasury Departmentstationery.Upon Tesla’s return to New York in 1900, he wrote again of his interest inplacing the equipment aboard their ships. Rear Admiral Higginson, chairman ofthe Light House Board, wrote back that his committee would meet in October todiscuss with Congress “the estimates of cost.”38 Higginson, who had visitedTesla in his lab in the late 1890s, wanted to help, but he had been placed inthe embarrassing position of withdrawing his offer of financial remunerationbecause of various levels of bureaucratic inanity. Tesla spent the time to godown to Washington to confer face-to-face with the high command—Hobson alsonegotiated on his friends behalf—but Telsa was essentially ignored and returnedto New York empty handed and disgusted with the way he was treated.From the point of view of the navy, wireless telegraphy was an entirely newfield, and they were unsure what to do. Furthermore, they may have been turnedoff by Tesla’s haughty manner, particularly when it came to being “compared” toMarconi, which had always enraged Tesla. (Keep in mind, however, that the navytook over ten years to recompense Hammond for his work on radio-guided missiles,and even then they almost didn’t come through. Tesla was by no means the onlyone to get the runaround from the military, and Hammond had the best connectionspossible through his influential father.)In 1902 the Office of Naval Intelligence called Comdr. F. M. Barber, who hadbeen in retirement in France, back to the States and put him in charge of theacquisition of wireless apparatus for testing. Although still taking a frugalposition, the navy came up with approximately $12,000 for the purchase ofwireless sets from different European companies. Orders were placed withSlaby-Arco and Braun-Siemans-Halske of Germany and Popoff, Ducretet andRochefort of France. Bids were also requested from De Forest, Fessenden, andTesla in America and Lodge-Muirhead in England. Marconi was excluded because hearrogantly coveted an all-or-nothing deal.39Fessenden was angry with the navy for obtaining equipment outside the UnitedStates and so did not submit a bid. Tesla was probably too upset with histreatment from the past and too involved with Wardenclyffe, which was underactive construction at that time, to get involved, and so the navy purchasedadditional sets from De Forest and Lodge-Muirhead.In 1903 a mock battle with the North Atlantic fleet was held five hundred milesoff the coast of Cape Cod. With the “White Squadron” commanded by Rear Adm. J.H. Sands and the “Blue Squadron” by Rear Admiral Higginson, Tesla’s ally, theuse of wireless played a key role in determining the victor. CommanderHigginson, who won the maneuver, commented, “To me, the great lesson of thesearch we ended today is the absolute need of wireless in the ships of the Navy.Do you know we are three years behind the times in the adoption of wireless?”40Based on comparison testing, it was determined that the Slaby-Arco systemoutperformed all others, and the navy ordered twenty more sets. Simultaneously,they purchased an eleven-year lease on the Marconi patents.41With the onset of World War I, the use of wireless became a necessity fororganizing troop movements, surveillance, and intercontinental communication.While the country was still neutral, the navy was able to continue their use ofthe German equipment—until sentiments began to shift irreversibly to the Britishside. Via the British navy, Marconi had his transmitters positioned in Canada,Bermuda, Jamaica, Columbia, the Falkland Islands, North and South Africa,Ceylon, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. His was a mighty operation. In theUnited States, the American Marconi division, under the directorship of thepolitically powerful John Griggs, former governor of New Jersey and attorneygeneral under President McKinley, had transmitters located in New York,Massachusetts, and Illinois.42 One key problem, however, was that the Marconiequipment was still using the outmoded spark-gap method.In April 1917, the U.S. Navy completed the seizure of all wireless stations,including those of their allies, the British. At the same time, Marconi was inthe process of purchasing the Alexanderson alternator, which was, in essence, arefinement of the Tesla oscillator. Simultaneously, the Armstrong feedbackcircuit was becoming an obvious necessity for any wireless instrumentation.However, the Armstrong invention created a judicial nightmare, not only becauseit used as its core the De Forest audion but also because De Forest’s inventionwas overturned in the courts in favor of an electronic tube developed byFessenden. Never mind that Tesla, as far back as 1902, had beaten Fessenden inthe courts for this development. With the Fessenden patent now under the controlof Marconi, the courts would come to rule that no one could use the Armstrongfeedback circuit without the permission of the other players.The most important ruling, concerning the true identity of the inventor of theradio, became neatly sidestepped by the War Powers Act of President Wilson,calling for the suspension of all patent litigation during the time of the war.France had already recognized Tesla’s priority by their high court, and Germanyrecognized him by Slaby’s affirmations and Telefunken’s decision to payroyalties; but in America, the land of Tesla’s home, the government backed offand literally prevented the courts from sustaining a decision. The Marconisyndicate, in touch with kings from two countries, with equipment instituted onsix continents, was simply too powerful.With the suspension of all patent litigation and the country in the midst of aworld war, Franklin Roosevelt, assistant secretary of the navy, penned thefamous Farragut letter. This document allowed such major companies as AT&T,Westinghouse, and American Marconi the right to pool together to produce eachother’s equipment without concern for compensating rightful inventors.Furthermore, it “assured contractors that the Government would assume liabilityin infringement suits.”43On July 1, 1918, Congress passed a law making the United States financiallyresponsible for any use of “an invention described in and covered by a patent ofthe United States.” By 1921, the U.S. government had spent $40 million onwireless equipment, a far cry from Secretary Long’s policy of refusing to pay afew thousand dollars for Tesla’s equipment eighteen years before. Thus, theInterdepartmental Radio Board met to decide various claims against it. Nearly $3million in claims were paid out. The big winners were Marconi Wireless, whichreceived $1.2 million for equipment and installations taken over (but not fortheir patents). International Radio Telegraph received $700,000; AT&T, $600,000;and Edwin Armstrong, $89,000. Tesla received a minuscule compensation throughLowenstein, who was awarded $23,000.44In 1921 the navy published a list of all the inventors in wireless who receivedcompensation from them. The list contained only patents granted after 1902.Inventors included Blockmen, Braun, Blondel, De Forest, Fuller, Hahnemann,Logwood, Meissner, Randahl, Poulsen, Schiessler, von Arco, and Watkins. Notethat both Tesla’s and Marconi’s names are missing.45 Marconi’s could be missingeither because his patents had lapsed or, more likely, because they were viewedas invalid from the point of view of the government. In the case of Tesla, allof his twelve key radio patents had “expired and [were] now common property.”46However, Tesla had renewed one fundamental patent in 1914,47 and this shouldhave been on the list, as should have Armstrong’s feedback patent.RADIO CORPORATION OF AMERICAThe U.S. government, through Franklin Roosevelt, knew that Marconi had infringedupon Tesla’s fundamental patents. They knew the details of Tesla’s rightfulclaims through their own files and through the record at the patent office. Inpoint of fact, it was Tesla’s proven declaration which was the basis and centralargument that the government had against Marconi when Marconi sued in the firstplace, and it was this same claim, and the same Navy Light House Board files,that would eventually be used by the U.S. Supreme Court to vindicate Tesla threemonths after he died, nearly twenty-five years later, in 1943.Rather than deal with the truth and with a difficult genius whose present workappeared to be in a realm above and beyond the operation of simple radiotelephones and wireless transmitters, Roosevelt, Daniels, President Wilson, andthe U.S. Navy, in the midst of war, took no interest in protecting Tesla’stower.In July 1917, Tesla packed his bags and said goodbye to the Waldorf-Astoria.Having lived there for nearly twenty years, he talked George Boldt Jr. intoallowing him to keep a large part of his personal effects in the basement of thehotel until he found a suitable place for transferring them. “I was sorry tohear about your father,” Tesla told the new manager, George Boldt Sr. havingdied just a few months before.Preparing to move to Chicago to work on his bladeless turbines, Tesla wasinvited to the Johnsons for a farewell dinner. Robert was now directing theaffairs of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, an organization whichcounted among its ranks Daniel Chester French, Charles Dana Gibson, WinslowHomer, Henry James and his brother William, Charles McKim, Henry Cabot Lodge,Teddy Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson. Katharine had been in bed for over a weekwith the grippe, but this evening was too important, and she dragged herself outof bed and put on her best gown.Dressed in straw hat, cane, white gloves, and his favorite green suedehigh-tops, Tesla arrived with a large bouquet of flowers and a check forJohnson.“Kate’s been ill,” Robert managed to say before the lady of the house appeared.Taking center stage, as she always tried to do when “He” was around, Kateradiated an intense glow of amorous pride as she held back the flood of tearswhile she chatted on an on about “how crazy [she was] about all of hergrandchildren.”48Taking a weekend train to Chicago, Tesla moved into the Blackstone Hotel,alongside the University of Chicago. On Monday morning the inventor hired alimousine to drop him at the headquarters of Pyle National Corporation. Havingalready shipped prototypes to give them a head start, he would now work at anintense pace in an entirely new setting, his goal being the perfection of hisrevolutionary bladeless turbines.49At night he liked to walk down the street from his hotel to the Museum of Artsand Sciences, the only building remaining from the World’s Fair of 1893. Therehe could stand by the great columns and think back to a time when, daily,hundreds of thousands would stream into a magical city powered by his vision.One Saturday, in the heat of summer, he took the mile walk along Lake Michigan,past the Midway, to a series of small lakes and a park which was once the Courtof Honor. There, at the entranceway, to a place that once was, he found, to hisdelight, the Statue of the Republic still standing, its gold plating all wornaway. With him was a letter from George Scherff.> August 20, 1917> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > I was deeply grieved and shocked when I read the enclosed, but I have the> supreme confidence that more glorious work will arise from the ruins.> > I trust that your work in Chicago is progressing to your satisfaction.> > Yours respectfully,> George Scherff50At the height of the world conflagration, the Smiley Steel Company’s explosivesexpert had circled the gargantuan transmitter to place a charge around eachmajor strut and nail the coffin shut on Tesla’s dream. With the Associated Pressrecording the event and military personnel apparently present, the magnifyingtransmitter was leveled, the explosion alarming many of the Shoreham residents.And with the death of the World Telegraphy Center came the birth of the RadioBroadcasting Corporation, a unique conglomerate of private concerns under theauspices of the U.S. government. Meetings were held behind closed doors inWashington between President Wilson, who wanted America to gain “radiosupremacy,”51 Navy Secretary Daniels, his assistant Franklin Roosevelt, andrepresentatives from GE, American Marconi, AT&T, and the WestinghouseCorporation. With J. P. Morgan & Company on the board of directors and theMarconi patents as the backbone of the organization, RCA was formed. It wouldcombine resources from these megacorporations, all of which had cross-licensingagreements with each other and co-owned the company.52 (Cross-licensingagreements also existed with the government, which also owned some wirelesspatents.) Here was another entente cordiale reminiscent of the AC polyphasedays, which was not so for the originator of the invention. It was a secondmajor time Tesla would be carved from his creation,53 a secret deal probablyconcocted which absolved the government from paying any licensing fee to Marconiin lieu of their burying their Tesla archives. David Sarnoff, as managingdirector, would soon take over the reins of the entire operation.The New York Sun inaccurately reported:> U.S. BLOWS UP TESLA RADIO TOWER> > Suspecting that German spies were using the big wireless tower erected at> Shoreham, L.I., about twenty years ago by Nikola Tesla, the Federal Government> ordered the tower destroyed and it was recently demolished with dynamite.> During the past month several strangers had been seen lurking about the> place.54> > The destruction of Nikola Tesla’s famous tower…shows forcibly the great> precautions being taken at this time to prevent any news of military> importance of getting to the enemy.55At the end of the war President Wilson returned all remaining confiscated radiostations to their rightful owners. American Marconi, now RCA, of course, was thebig beneficiary.56In 1920 the Westinghouse Corporation was granted the right to “manufacture, useand sell apparatus covered by the [Marconi] patents.”57 Westinghouse also formedan independent radio station which became as prominent as RCA. At the end of theyear, Tesla wrote a letter to E. M. Herr, president of the company, offering hiswireless expertise and equipment.> November 16, 1920> > Dear Mr. Tesla,> > I regret that under the present circumstances we cannot proceed further with> any developments of your activities.58A few months later, Westinghouse requested that Tesla “speak to our ‘invisibleaudience’ some Thursday night in the near future [over our…] radiotelephonebroadcasting station.”59> November 30, 1921> > Gentleman,> > Twenty-one years ago I promised a friend, the late J.

Partially materialized on thephysical plane as Wardenclyffe, this was the inventor’s Holy Grail, the key toanointment. In 1917 the project was demolished, and in that sense, so was theinventor. Capable of recognizing the absurdities of life and drawing fromtranscendent energies, the mystic sought regeneration by consummating his grandplan in fantasy form and by seeking a new philosopher’s stone.One year earlier, when Tesla’s project was at its bleakest, he had formed analliance with one of his most ardent admirers, Hugo Gernsback, editor ofElectrical Experimenter. Gernsback had first heard about Tesla when he was achild growing up in Luxembourg in the late 1890s. It was at this time that theten-year-old came across the fantastic picture of the emblazoned electriciansending hundreds of thousands of volts through his body and the declaration inthe accompanying article that he was the grandest wizard of the age. Consideredby most futurologists to be the “founder and father of science fiction,”Gernsback studied electronics at Bingen Technicum in Europe, before immigratingto America, at the age of nineteen, in 1903.2With his mind totally captivated by the fantastic union of science and fantasy,the exuberant youth wrote a spectacular tale which took place in the year 2660called RALPH 124C41 +, which he serialized in his new magazine ModernElectronics. Simultaneously, he also opened up Hugo Gernsback’s ElectroImporting Company, an all-purpose electronics shop located under the “el” atFulton Street. There the new breed of amateur ham operators could buy whateverthey wanted and browse through “the biggest bunch of junk you ever saw.”3Gernsback’s first meeting with Tesla was in 1908, when he stopped at theinventor’s lab to view the new turbine.4Gernsback wrote, “The door opens, and out steps a tall figure—over six feethigh—gaunt but erect. It approaches slowly, stately. You become conscious atonce that you are face to face with a personality of a high order. Nikola Teslaadvances and shakes your hand with a powerful grip, surprising for a man oversixty. A winning smile from piercing light bluegray eyes, set in extraordinarilydeep sockets, fascinates you and makes you feel at once at home.“You are guided into an office immaculate in its orderliness. Not a speck ofdust is to be seen. No papers litter the desk, everything just so. It reflectsthe man himself, immaculate in attire, orderly and precise in his everymovement. Drest [sic] in a dark frock coat, he is entirely devoid of alljewelry. No ring, stickpin or even watch-chain can be seen.”5In 1916 the inventor edited a consequential article for Gernsback on themagnifying transmitter. The inventor also promised to think more seriously aboutputting his life story down on paper; in fact, he wrote a short first draft forScientific American which he embellished for the Edison Medal acceptancespeech.6By this time, Gernsback had also secured the talents of the gifted illustratorFrank R. Paul. Destined to be the most influential science-fiction artist of thetwentieth century, Paul was able to “render the possible development of anyinvention [from]…a raw idea into a picture fantasy.” With a penchant for drawingfuturistic scenarios such as Goliath-sized insects, spaceships orbiting planets,and a variety of humanoidian mad scientists conquering galactic empires, Pauladvanced to become the premier cover artist for Electrical Experimenter, andlater Amazing Stories and Science Wonder Stories.7 He was assigned the role ofcompleting Tesla’s tower in picture form. The drawing, replete with fullyfunctioning Wardenclyffe transmitters and Tesla wingless airfoils beaming downdeath rays to incoming ships, not only became a fantastic cover for ElectricalExperimenter; it also became the centerpiece of the wizard’s new letterhead.As alchemist, Tesla transformed the ruins of his station into a fantasticGernsbackian World Telegraphy Center, as he also transformed himself, leavingNew York City to begin anew with his next major creation.Before he left, in June 1917, the inventor wrote Jack Morgan, hoping,optimistically, because of new developments, to pay off his debt to thefinancier “in about four months…My big ship is still to come in, but I have nowa marvelous opportunity having perfected an invention which will astound thewhole world.” Cryptically, Tesla said that the invention would “afford aneffective means for meeting the menace of the submarine.” Whether he was talkingabout a long-range radar system, a remote-controlled torpedo, or some otherinvention is uncertain.8The following month, Tesla moved to Chicago, and he stayed there throughNovember 1918, working with Pyle National on the perfection of his turbines.Here, during the day, with the slate clean, the gangly mechanic could continueto battle the demons by plunging himself into a brand-new endeavor. At night, ascreative author, the cognoscente sketched out the first draft of his expandedautobiography.Most of the time, he drew from his own capital for fear of causing difficultieswith the new partners.9 He knew he would eventually receive compensation becausethe Chicago company had signed an agreement promising “cash payments andguarantees” with the expiration of their option, but carrying costs werebecoming a problem.10To handle expenses in the interim, the inventor requested that Scherff step upthe pressure on receiving royalties from the various wireless companies. Hisgreatest source of income was probably the Waltham Watch Company, which was nowin the active stage of marketing his speedometer. Even though the war was stillgoing on, the inventor expected to receive compensation from Telefunken “afterthe hostilities cease,” even though he would have to “apply to the War TradeBoard under the Trading with the Enemy act for a license to receive payment.”11Progress on the turbines was hampered by numerous obstacles. Nevertheless, theinventor was delighted with the “extraordinarily efficient personnel” andoverall organization of the Chicago firm. As the disks could rotate at speedsranging from 10,000 to 35,000 rpm, the centrifugal force tended to elongatethem. Thus, they were subject to fatigue and ran the risk of cracking afterperforming for long periods of time. Perceived by skeptical engineers as fatalflaws, Tesla endeavored to hammer home the point that stress was a factor in allengines.12 Thus, much of the time in Chicago was spent experimenting withdifferent alloys and inventing means for instantaneously regulatingorthorotational speed and centrifugal pressure to minimize the stress factor.“For instance, suppose that the steam pressure of the locomotive would vary fromsay 50 to 200 lbs, no matter how rapidly, this would not have the slightesteffect on the…performance of the turbine.”13In January 1918, the U.S. Machine Manufacturing Company inquired about placingone of Tesla’s turbines inside an airplane, and a few months later, the ChicagoPneumatic Tool Company also expressed interest. Tesla was writing Scherff,expecting the invention to yield $25 million per year. However, there was stillthe difficulty of perfecting it, and Tesla was still not free of the numerousother problems of his life, such as the past debts and the continuing quagmireof litigation. During the summer, the inventor twisted his back and was laid upfor several weeks.14During Tesla’s time in Chicago, he calculated his operating expenses at $17,600,with revenues of $12,500. Pyle National tried to get out of their debt bysending a check for $1,500, but Tesla returned the token payment and threatenedsuit. Meanwhile, back at home, the sheriff took possession of the Woolworthoffice, so Tesla had to wrestle some capital from Pyle National to release hiscompany. In New York, George Scherff continued to handle all of the details.Concerning his relationship with the government (as stated in chapter 41), mostof Tesla’s wireless patents had expired, and his 1914 patent was complicated byits clash with the Marconi claim. However, he was negotiating with thegovernment on an engine for a plane, writing to the Bureau of Steam Engineeringat this time.15 In litigation, Tesla won a few thousand dollars from Lowenstein,lost a $67,000 case against a Mr. DeLaVergne, in part, because he refused totravel back to New York to testify, and had to pay out $1,600 to A. M. Foster,for nonpayment of services rendered.16Before returning to Manhattan for the last months of 1918, the inventor traveledto Milwaukee to visit the Allis Chalmers people. There he was met by the astutebut pedantic head engineer Hans Dahlstrand. After providing various articles andrecords from his work at the Edison station and Pyle National, a contract wasdrawn up for Tesla to return to Milwaukee and develop the engine withDahlstrand. Skeptical from the start, the learned head engineer reluctantlyagreed to defer to Tesla’s wishes and begin a preparatory investigation of theturbine before he arrived.Throughout the period 1917-1926, the inventor spent most of his time outside NewYork City. In the years 1917-1918, he was in Chicago with Pyle National; in1919-22 he was in Milwaukee with Allis Chalmers; for the last month of 1922 hewas in Boston with the Waltham Watch Company; and in the years 1925-26 he was inPhiladelphia working on the gasoline turbine at Budd Manufacturing Company.17Tesla also sold a motor which was used in motion-picture equipment to WisconsinElectric in 1918 and a valvular conduit, or “unidirectional fluid flow tube,” toan unspecified oil company.18 This last invention, which can also be called afluid diode, could not only be used to pump oil from the ground but also beattached to the bladeless turbine to turn it into a combustion engine. Accordingto Tesla expert Leland Anderson, this invention “is the only valving patentwithout moving parts. It has been used in attempts to develop micro-miniatureradiation hardened logic circuits and simple fluid computers.”19> Waltham Speedometers & Automobile Clocks> > Every progressive automobile manufacturer is adding improvements to his car.> This is why the only Air-Friction Speedometer in the world, invented by Nikola> Tesla, perfected and developed by Waltham…has won the unqualified approval of> the world’s great automotive engineers.

This agreement includedroyalties which he received until at least 1929. Pyle National eventually paidhim $15,000, and maybe $30,000 in 1925; from Budd National, he received $30,000for the turbines, and probably a similar amount from Allis Chalmers, from whomhe was expecting profits on the order of a quarter of a million dollars peryear.22 George Scherff received 5 percent from most of these contracts.Tesla arrived back home at the tail end of 1918 in time for Christmas dinnerwith the Johnsons. He stayed for a brief time at the Waldorf and then moved tothe Hotel St. Regis, where he lived off and on for the next few years. The greatinfluenza epidemic was just in its beginning stages, and Katharine was one ofthe first to display signs of its ravages. In the next year, over a billionpeople were infected and 20 million died world-wide. She was lucky to survive.Her health deteriorated throughout the year, and by the following Christmas sheexperienced episodes during which she lost consciousness three times within asingle day.23 Perhaps heightened by the severity of the situation and with newincome from Waltham, Tesla paid Robert checks totaling at least $1,500 duringthis period.Throughout 1919, Tesla’s autobiography appeared in serialized form inGernsback’s Electrical Experimenter. Paired with photographs and a series ofspectacular Frank Paul drawings, the story began as an unusual tale of awizard-child growing up in another era in a faraway land. The account of theearly years of Tesla’s life oozed charm and wit, with its numerous Mark Twainiandepictions of amusing anecdotes, harrowing experiences, life with his inventivemother, preacher father, prodigal brother, and three doting sisters. Diggingdeep into his past, Tesla explored the tragedy of his brother’s death, how itimpacted his career decision, the traumatic move away from the idyllic farm tothe clutter of Gospić, his college years, engineering training in Europe beforecoming to America, and his early meetings with Edison, Westinghouse, and membersof the Royal Society of London. Also included was an uncommon description of hispeculiar powers of eidetic imagery, out-of-body experiences, childhoodillnesses, phobias, and idiosyncrasies. In month after month of fascinatingreading, the pundit detailed the development of his ideas, his physicalbreakdown and “opening up of the third eye” experience and accompanyingrevelation which led to the development of the rotating magnetic field, hiscreation of the telautomaton, work in Colorado Springs, and the grandWardenclyffe world-wireless design.This liaison with Gernsback supplied the inventor with a steady income andhelped Electrical Experimenter boost its circulation to around 100,000.Simultaneously, My Inventions also provided the world with a notableautobiographical testimony of one of the most singular and controversialpersonalities of the age.The year also saw numerous articles about Marconi’s recent experiencesintercepting impulses possibly emanating from extraterrestrials. With ProfessorPickering writing Elihu Thomson that he might have detected vegetation on themoon24 and a resurgence of interest in the “Canals of Mars” scenario, the pressjumped at the Italian’s far-out declaration and grilled him for additionaldetails.Stealing Tesla’s thunder even on this front, Marconi proclaimed that he “hadoften received strong signals out of the ether which seemed to come from someplace outside the earth and which might conceivably have proceeded from thestars.” As to the language problem of communicating with the Martians, Marconisaid, “It is an obstacle, but I don’t think it is insurmountable. You see, onemight get through some such message as 2 plus 2 equals 4, and go on repeating ituntil an answer came back signifying ‘Yes.’…Mathematics must be the samethroughout the physical universe.”25Seeking redress in a variety of ways, Tesla sought publicity in ElectricalWorld, where he attributed the Italian’s signals to an undertone metronomeeffect emanating from other wireless operators. Anticipating the possibilitythat a critic might ascribe the same mechanism to his own extraterrestrialencounter of 1899, Tesla added: “At the time I carried on those investigationsthere existed no wireless plant [capable of]…produc[ing] a disturbanceperceptible in a radius of more than a few miles.”26 This, of course, was afalse premise, as Marconi at that time was already sending messages hundreds ofmiles.Johnson wrote Tesla that “When Marconi repeats [your] idea, it is no longerlaughed at,” but in some circles, this did not seem to be the case.> CELESIAL MOVIES> > Mr. Tesla has small confidence in the Marconian idea of getting into> communication by way of mathematics.

If> civilization on Mars is as old as we are asked to believe, the Martians have> no doubt acquired their own taste in faces.27Although the Christmas dinner of 1919 was marred by Katharine’s ill health, itwas overshadowed by good news: President Wilson had appointed Robert ambassadorto Italy! With mixed emotions and Katharine apparently recovering her health,Tesla’s friends left for Europe, where they stayed throughout the followingyear.Now, really alone, the wizard continued his slide from public scrutiny. Copied,mocked at, and ultimately abandoned by the world he helped create, Tesla triedto keep his life in perspective and contain his anger by doing his best totransform it; but over time the irony of it all took its toll and caused analready eccentric individual to exaggerate already strange ways. Tesla wouldbecome more fanatical about cleanliness and spend more time walking the streetsafter hours, circling his block three times before entering the St. Regis andavoiding stepping on cracks on the sidewalks. Some said he peeked in windows andliked to watch others in voyeuristic ways. Practicing “gastronomicalfrugality,”28 the celibate slowly turned away from the meat and potatoes of lifeand eventually from eating solids altogether. Now he would rarely write in pen,preferring the less definite pencil. He would spend more time by himself,feeding the pigeons at midnight by the Forty-second Street Library or stealingaway via the Staten Island ferry to a quiet farm where he could block out thecity and search once again for his fountainhead.29 With the Johnsons’ departure,he left for Milwaukee to consummate his relationship with Allis Chalmers.Much of his time in Wisconsin was invested in trying to perfect the turbine.However, he had reached an impasse, what Sartre calls a “counterfinality,” orunforeseen event which opposes the goal intended, with Hans Dahlstrand, headengineer. Thwarted, Tesla had no recourse but to return to New York. So upsetwas he that he refused to talk about it when his biographer, Jack O’Neill,questioned him on the Milwaukee experience.30Allis Chalmers had issued Dahlstrand’s detailed report describing a long list ofserious problems, as he saw it, in the manufacture of the turbine. Aside fromthe fatigue and cracking of the disks, Dahlstrand also cited additionalimpediments, including only a 38 percent efficiency performance, a decrease ofmechanical efficiency as steam pressure increased, a problem in designingattachment gears needed to join the turbine to other units, and a high cost ofproduction. Another factor was that the present-day motors, such as the Parsonsturbine which was being developed by Westinghouse, or the Curtis motor, beingdeveloped by GE, were operating satisfactorily.31This question of the failure of the Tesla turbine was posed to a number of Teslaexperts. Leland Anderson found that manufacturers interested in the Teslaturbine “all say it is a fine concept and an excellent machine, but there [are]too [many]…support systems…to be replaced for a machine not that much better inperformance. And that is the point—the Tesla turbine is good, but not that muchbetter.”32C. R. Possell, president and chief engineer of the American Development &Manufacturing Company, one of the only existing organizations working onmanufacturing Tesla bladeless turbines and pumps, offered a somewhat differentexplanation. Mr. Possell, who initially worked on the Tesla “boundary layer dragturbine” during the Korean War for the military and who has been actively tryingto perfect the turbine for thirty-five years, stated that the main problem hadsimply to do with the high cost of research and development.According to Possell, “Tesla was about twenty-five to thirty years ahead of histime. Metallurgy was not what it is today. Magnetic bearings are a whole newscience. He didn’t have the right materials. Instrumentation [for measuringperformance] was in its infancy, and it was hard to demonstrate the turbineadequately. Somewhere between the first prototype and the first use of it, youare going to have hundreds and hundreds of man hours, and the turbine didn’t getthat.” Possell gave as just one example (and there are numerous others), the“millions of man hours” required to get a plane to fly at Mach One.At present, the Tesla pump, based on the same technology, has been used by JerryLaBine as a replacement for the motor in the jet ski recreational vehicle, andalso, it has been further developed by Max Gurth, inventor of the “Discflopump.” Utilizing Tesla’s basic idea and principles associated with the structureof a vortex (responsible for such events as whirlpools and tornadoes) andlaminar flow, (i.e., the natural, gentle movement through fluids), Gurth hasbeen able to increase the space between the disks. Thus, he has improved itsability to move such difficult products as solid waste and petrochemicals.Whereas a normal pump would have their blades pitted and corroded by coming intocontact with the assorted troublesome products, the boundary layer drag pump hasno blades and therefore avoids that entire problem!33Possell not only sees a day when the pump will be used inside the human body,as, for instance, a heart valve, but also a day when the turbine is perfected.One of the great advantages of a bladeless Tesla engine is its ability towithstand extremely high temperatures. “Bladed turbines are about at theirmaximum,” Possell said, meaning that they can run at about 2,000 degreesFahrenheit, “although GE is experimenting with turbines that can run at 2,200degrees. If you could boost the temperature an additional 350 degrees, you woulddouble its Horse Power output.” Possell is convinced that the bladeless turbinebuilt with new ceramic components could run at about 2,700 degrees, which wouldeffectively “triple the Horse Power performance.” Thus, Possell is also workingto design an engine to compete with the Pegasus engine found in the VTOL(vertical takeoff and landing) Harrier jet. This VTOL of the future has beennamed the Phalanx. The vehicle will not come about, however, without largefunding and commitment from the highest levels of industry and government.34The waiter was surprised to see an elegant gentleman sitting at the breakfastcounter before the restaurant was officially opened. “Aren’t you Dr. Tesla,” thefellow inquired, amazed to see such an important man back in town after so manyyears.Having received permission from the owner to eat as early as possible, Teslareplied in the affirmative. He had journeyed to Colorado Springs from Milwaukee,retracing his past and looking toward a possible future when he might erectanother wireless station. With a key from Dean Evans of the local engineeringschool, the inventor was able to utilize the lab to work on some technicalcalculations. Enjoying the much-needed respite, and perhaps a quick jaunt in ahot spring, the inventor had returned to his beloved retreat. There the sprymountaineer could perch himself like a phoenix on a cliff, to sit andcontemplate Thor’s design, and watch the lightning storms that crackled alongthe jagged horizon.35"},{"pageContent":"43THE ROARING TWENTIES (1918-27) [002-toc.html#ch43]> I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years.

Shortlythereafter, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated his throne and fled to Holland; hiscountry had incurred a debt of $33 billion to the Allies. The new heroes of theage were aeronauts, like Eddie Rickenbacker, hailed as the top ace withtwenty-six downed Messerschmitts. Humans were leaping continents the followingyear, with the British propelling the sturdy Dirigible R-34 from Edinburgh toRoosevelt Field and back to London in seven days. This first-ever round-triptransatlantic airship journey was commanded by Maj. G. H. Scott of the Royal AirForce, complete with his thirty-man crew and Willy Ballantyne, atwenty-three-year-old stowaway. The same year, with Tesla, Thomson, Marconi, andPickering bickering about Martian signals and lunar plant life, Robert Goddard,military rocket expert and physics professor from Clark University, proposed aseemingly outrageous trajectory for sending a man to the moon. Even Teslathought the scheme far-fetched, for the known fuels of the day did not havesufficient “explosive power,” and even if they did, he doubted that a“rocket…would operate at 459 degrees below zero—the temperature ofinterplanetary space.”2In 1920, William Jennings Bryan led the campaign to institute Prohibition; AnneMorgan and her suffragettes gained the right to vote for women; and fourmotion-picture celebrities, Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, Mary Pickford, andher new husband, Douglas Fairbanks, formed United Artists. As the war faded,sports figures became the new heroes, the young Red Sox pitcher Babe Ruth makingthe papers after being sold to the Yankees for a whopping $125,000.Hugo Gernsback tried to put Tesla on the masthead of yet another futuristicElectrical Experimenter spin-off, but his financial offer was, in Tesla’s eyes,puny, and he rejected it. Feeling that he had been underpaid for hisautobiography, Tesla replied, “I appreciated your unusual intelligence andenterprise, but the trouble with you seems to be that you are thinking only ofH. Gernsback first of all, once more, and then again.”3 Gernsback, however,never wavered in his praise of Tesla and continued to feature Teslaic articlesand drawings in his various periodicals. On the topic of thought transference,as a materialist, Tesla completely rejected any concept related to ESP; however,he did think that it was possible to read out the thoughts of another person’sbrain by attaching TV equipment to the rods and cones of the retina, which was,in his view, the arena of cognitive processing.4 This invention, called the“thought recorder,” provided the basis for a number of Frank Paul spectaculars,such as his October 1929 Amazing Stories cover depicting two humans wearingthought-reading helmets.REVISITING WARDENCLYFFEThe 1920s marked a period of turmoil and revolution. Homeostasis had yet tosettle in. With the Johnsons still in Europe, Tesla was forced to face thepainful Wardenclyffe fiasco once again without the solace of his close friends.With his Manhattan attorney, William Rasquin Jr., Tesla took the train out tothe Supreme Court of Suffolk County to battle agents for the George C. Boldtestate and the Waldorf-Astoria, who were trying, once again, to recoupapproximately $20,000 in unpaid rent. The referee was the Honorable RowlandMiles.The case dragged on for months and covered over three hundred pages oftestimony. Tesla testified that in March 1915 he had put up Wardenclyffe ascollateral against past monies owed to Francis S. Hutchins, personal counsel forGeorge C. Boldt and the Waldorf-Astoria. Hutchins and the hotel interpreted thetransaction as an outright transference of the deed. Since the hotel now thoughtthat they owned the property, they felt that it was their right to resell theland and take down the tower to sell the lumber and other parts for salvage.When Tesla took the stand, he was asked if he remembered the day he deliveredthe deed.“I distinctly remember [telling] Mr. Hutchins that the plant had cost anenormous amount of money in comparison with which this indebtedness was atrifle, and that I expected great realizations from the plant, $30,000 a day, ifthe plant had been completed.” Tesla assumed that if he paid the $20,000 owed,he would have gotten back the plant. He further assumed that the Waldorf-Astoriawould take good care of the property because of its enormous value. They did nottake good care, however. Vandals broke in and stole equipment, such as expensivelathes.“Can you describe the structures and any other equipment that was in thelaboratory,” Tesla’s counsel asked. The plaintiffs attorney tried to block thetestimony, but the judge allowed Tesla to begin.The inventor sat back, removed his white gloves, placed them on the podium, andproceeded. “The building formed a square about one hundred feet by one hundred.It was divided into four compartments, with an office and a machine shop and twovery large areas.” “The engines were located on one side, and the boilers on theother side, and in the center, the chimney rose.”When asked how big the boilers were, Tesla said that there were two300-horsepower boilers surrounded by two 16,000 gallon water tanks that utilizedthe ambient heat for hot water. “To the right of the boiler plant were theengines. One was a 400-horsepower Westinghouse engine, and a 35-kilowatt outfitwhich, with the engine, drove the dynamo for lighting and furnished otherconveniences.” There were high- and low-pressure compressors, various kinds ofwater pumps, and a main switchboard for operating everything.“Towards the road, on the railroad side, was the machine shop. That compartmentwas one hundred by thirty-five feet with a door in the middle and it contained Ithink eight lathes. Then there was a milling machine, a planer and shaper, aspliner, three drills, four motors, a grinder and a Blacksmith’s forge.“Now, in the compartment opposite, which was the same size as the machine shop,there was contained the real expensive apparatus. There were two special glasscases where I kept historical apparatus which was exhibited and described in mylectures and scientific articles. There were at least a thousand bulbs and tubeseach of which represented a certain phase of scientific development. Then therewas also five large tanks, four of which contained special transformers createdso as to transform the energy for the plant. They were about, I should say,seven feet high and about five by five feet each, and were filled with specialoil which we call transformer oil, to stand an electric tension of 60,000 volts.Then there was a fifth similar tank for special purposes. And then there were myelectric generating apparatus. That apparatus was precious, because it couldflash a message across the Atlantic, and yet it was built in 1894 or 1895.”The court sat humbled. The opposing attorney tried to block Tesla’s furthertestimony, but the judge allowed the inventor to continue.“Beyond the door of this compartment,” Tesla continued, “there were to be thecondensers, what we call electric condensers, which would store the energy andthen discharge and make it go around the world. Some of these condensers were inan advanced state of construction, and others were not. Then there was a veryexpensive piece of apparatus that the Westinghouse Company furnished me, onlytwo of this kind have ever been constructed. It was developed by myself withtheir engineers. That was a steel tank which contained a very elaborateassemblage of coils, an elaborate regulating apparatus, and it was intended togive every imaginable regulation that I wanted in my measurements and control ofenergy.”Tesla also described “a special 100-horsepower motor equipped with elaboratedevices for rectifying the alternating currents and sending them into thecondensers. On this apparatus alone I spent thousands of dollars. Then along thecenter of the room I had a very precious piece of apparatus.” It was Tesla’sremote-controlled boat.“Was that all there was, generally speaking?”“Oh, no, nowhere near,” Tesla replied. The inventor then proceeded to describe aseries of closets that housed numerous other appliances, “each representing adifferent phase” of his work. There was the testing room, which includedprecious instruments given to him by Lord Kelvin, a breach, and otherinstruments such as voltmeters, wattmeters, ampere meters. In that small spacethere was a fortune.The opposing attorney asked that the statement “there was a fortune” be takenout.“Yes, strike it out,” said the judge.Tesla then went on to discuss the tower. After describing the structure abovethe ground, he described the shaft. “You see,” Tesla said, “the underground workwas one of the most expensive parts of the tower.” He was referring particularlyto special apparatus he invented for “gripping the earth.”“The shaft, your Honor,” was first covered with timber and the inside withsteel. In the center of this there was a winding stairs going down and in thecenter of the stairs there was a big shaft again through which the current wasto pass, and this shaft was so figured in order to tell exactly where the nodalpoint is, so that I could calculate exactly the size of the earth or thediameter of the earth and measure it exactly within four feet with that machine.“And then the real expensive work was to connect that central part with theearth, and there I had special machines rigged up which would push the ironpipes, one length after another, and I pushed, I think sixteen of them, threehundred feet. The current through these pipes [was to] take hold of the earth.Now that was a very expensive part of the work, but it does not show on thetower, but it belongs to the tower.“The primary purpose of the tower, your Honor, was to telephone, to send thehuman voice and likeness around the globe. That was my discovery, that Iannounced in 1893, and now all the wireless plants are doing that. There is noother system being used. Then, the idea was to reproduce this apparatus andconnect it just with a central station and telephone office, so that you maypick up your telephone and if you wanted to talk to a telephone subscriber inAustralia you would simply call up that plant and that plant would connect youimmediately. And I had contemplated to have press messages, stock quotations,pictures for the press and the reproductions of signatures, checks andeverything transmitted from there, but…“And then I was going to interest people in a larger project and the Niagarapeople had given me 10,000-horse power…”“Did you have any conversation with Mr. Hutchins or anybody representing theplaintiffs concerning the taking down of the tower or anything like that?” askedthe judge.“No, sir. It came like a bolt from the blue sky.”As the deed had been transferred in a legal manner with Tesla’s full compliance,Judge Miles ruled in favor of the hotel. The inventor’s lawyer countered,arguing that the Waldorf-Astoria sold equipment which they did not account forand destroyed a property worth $350,000 to try and recoup the $20,000 owed. “Theproperty despoiled exceeded the value of the mortgage, and therefore theplaintiffs [the hotel management] should have been held to account to defendantTesla.” Precedent cases were cited.The Waldorf-Astoria, however, had the last word. “As a solace to the wild hopesof this dreamy inventor,” their lawyer wrote, “if prior to that time he shouldgrasp in his fingers any one of the castles in Spain which always were floatingabout in his dreams, and had he paid the board bills which he owed, this wildscrubby woodland, including the Tower of Babel thereon, would cheerfully havebeen reconveyed to him. By no fair inference or construction can [Tesla’scounterclaim make void this judgment]. It was merely a sop to the vanity of abrilliant but unpractical mind. The judgement should be affirmed with costs.”5In the summer of 1922, Robert Johnson and his ailing “ambassadress”6 returned tothe States from Italy. They arrived in time to attend Paderewski’s comebackpiano concerto with their elusive friend at Carnegie Hall in November.Robert’s autobiography, Remembered Yesterdays, which was just completed,highlighted not only a memorable meeting between Tesla and Paderewski in thelate 1890s but also the virtuoso’s 1919 stint as president of Poland. As thepianist had held office for only ten months, Tesla was moved to jest that it was“just long enough to gain publicity for his next tour.”“That’s a terrible thing to say, Mr. Tesla,” Kate sparkled as they stepped intothe limousine that was to take the trio to the opening. Dressed in black capes,canes, and silk high hats, the tall “angular” gentlemen struck a smart pair asthey accompanied the suddenly recovering and radiant Mrs. Filipov.“Seeing Paderewski again is like falling in love all over,” she said between hermen. Tesla looked down and noticed the sorrow that lay hidden beneath her brow.His was apparent to her as well. Robert’s upper lip held them steady.The Bolsheviks were taking over in Russia; Communist and anarchist uprisingsreverberated throughout the world. In the United States there were race riots inChicago, Negro lynchings in Minnesota, a suspicious explosion outside the J. P.Morgan Building, in New York, killing thirty people and wounding three hundredothers, and forty thousand Klansmen marching on Washington. It was time to dosomething to stop the tide, so Attorney General A. M. Palmer rounded up threehundred Communists and sixty-seven anarchists in thirty-three cities. The lastgroup arrested faced deportation for bombing out the windows and homes of Palmerand also Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Roosevelt. Eugene V. Debs,still in prison for violating the Espionage Act, was nominated once again to runfor president by the Socialist party; Woodrow Wilson received the Nobel PeacePrize.The election of 1920 was the first to be broadcast by radio to a nationalaudience; Lee De Forest announced the wrong winner four years earlier to a muchsmaller crowd. With his running mate Calvin Coolidge, Warren Harding trouncedDemocratic contender James Cox and vice presidential hopeful Franklin Roosevelt.By this time, RCA was a megacorporation, writing million-dollar checks to JohnHays Hammond Jr. and Edwin Armstrong. Having uncovered a great new market, RCAhad increased its radio audience in 1924 to 5 million listeners. Profits weremade not only in selling air space to advertisers but also in selling the radiosthemselves. By 1928 national broadcasts would link all forty-eight states, andsoon after, regular shows featuring Buck and Will Rogers, Amos ‘n’ Andy, Burnsand Allen, the Shadow, Stoopnagle and Budd, and Jack Benny would become dailyfare. Such advertisers as Lucky Strike, Maxwell House, Canada Dry, Chesterfield,and Pontiac would soon insinuate themselves into the mass psyche. Tesla wouldsay that he cared not to listen to the radio because he found it “toodistracting.”Other milestones during this period included the anointment of the “ManassaMauler,” Jack Dempsey, as world heavyweight champion, a soaring stock market,and a number of key trials, most notably, Sacco and Vanzetti’s, allegedanarchists accused of murder, the Scopes monkey trial, and the $500 fine andten-day incarceration of Mae West for lewd improvisations during her hitBroadway play Sex. Newest crazes included speakeasies, Al Capone, flapperdresses, and such dances as the Charleston, waltzing till you dropped, and theShimmy. Although the radio was czar at home, for a night on the town, silentmovies were king. Deaths during the Roaring Twenties included T. C. Martin,Jacob Schiff, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew Carnegie, Enrico Caruso, WilliamRoentgen, Alexander Graham Bell, Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, and thethirty-one-year-old heartthrob Rudolf Valentino, who, along with Harry Houdini,died of a ruptured appendix, Vladimir Lenin, Sarah Bernhardt, PrincessLwoff-Parlaghy, and Katharine Johnson, who passed on during autumn 1925.7> October 15, 1925> > Dear Tesla,> > It was Mrs. Johnson’s injunction that last night of her life that I should> keep in touch with Tesla.

BETTINIThroughout the world, wireless inventors were becoming a precious commodity. InItaly, Mussolini “adroitly” redirected the Italian senate’s Fascist salute toGuglielmo Marconi for having established a national broadcasting system.9 A fewyears later, Il Duce approached Jack Hammond to institute a “foolproof secretradio system,” which, to Jack’s later revulsion, became a tool for killinganti-Fascists.10In the Soviet Union, Lenin contacted Tesla to ask him to come over to hiscountry to institute his AC polyphase and “regional power-distributionstations.”11 Sending emissaries to lure the Serbian nobleman. Tesla becameenmeshed in a shady organization known as the Friends of Soviet Russia. Withover 5 million people dying there of famine in 1922, the celebrated inventor hadbeen approached by Ivan Mashevkief, of the Russian Workers Club of Manhattan,and by Elsie Blanc, a Communist leader from Massachusetts, to speak at “monstermass-meeting” at the Grange Hall in Springfield in June 1922. The purpose of theconclave, which was coorganized by a group of “Italian radicals,” was ostensiblyto raise money for clothing and food for the starving and dying people ofRussia. Since a Russian “bomb factory” was discovered in a warehouse inManhattan at that time, no doubt some of the funds were also siphoned off formore nefarious activities.Traveling to Springfield with Mashevkief, who described “with considerableimagination the manufacturing industries of Russia,” Tesla heard the firstspeaker announce “that the only solution to the economic problem [in Europe] wasin the hands of the working class…[which] will have charge of all means ofproduction. ‘They will do this for humanity’s sake and not for profit.’ Thespeaker prophesied that an economic collapse of the entire industrial structureof Europe will come and when it does, the working class will then secure fullcontrol of affairs. The speaker emphatically stated that the famine in Russiato-day is caused by counterrevolutionary forces backed by world capitalists andnot because of the alleged poor rule of the bolshevists.”According to Adrian Potter, the FBI agent who monitored the event, “‘NicoloTesla’ was addressed by several Italians as ‘Bettini’…Tesla or Bettiniprophesied that Italy was soon to adopt a communist form of Government.”12Clearly, Tesla was, in some sense, a revolutionary and on the side of theworker, but more for the purpose of transforming and uplifting their station.Tesla’s inventions were purposely constructed so as to reduce consumer cost,preserve natural resources, and relieve humanity of unnecessary manual labor.The Serb believed in the profit motive and strove all his life to become whatLenin loathed, so the reader should read this FBI report with caution, asTesla’s supposed statement and motive for attending the meeting are not totallyclear. Most likely he was concerned with the plight of the starving people inRussia (the U.S. government would send a reported $60 million in aid to feed theSoviets over the next decade),13 and he was also looking to sell his inventionsto this new regime, with an accompanying vast potential market.Where the Soviet leadership sought Tesla out, the aging gnomewizard andodd-combination capitalist-socialist Charles Steinmetz initiated his owncontact, writing the Soviet premier a letter in February 1922. “Wishing Leninsuccess,” Steinmetz “express[ed] confidence that he would complete theastonishing work of social and industrial construction which Russia hadundertaken under difficult circumstances.”Joining a variety of Soviet organizations, Steinmetz also publicized hiscorrespondence with Lenin and “published two papers in the Electrical World thatdescribed Russia’s electrification plans.” Scratching his gnarled arthriticfingernails on GE’s capitalist blackboard, the self-righteous $100,000-per-yearsupposed academic implacably “called for American capital to support theproject.”14Although Lenin’s correspondence with Tesla has not been located, his response toSteinmetz is well known. “Lenin replied…that ‘to my shame’ he had heard the nameof Steinmetz only several months ago…thanked Steinmetz for his help, butsuggested that the absence of diplomatic relations between the United States andSoviet Russia would impede its implementation.” Lenin, however, would publishthe note from the prominent engineer and send Steinmetz an autographedphotograph of himself, which he received a few months later.15Just one year later, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, the four-foot giant ofelectrical engineering, bon vivant, and family man, was dead. He wasfifty-eight.16Tesla was living on Fifth Avenue, two blocks from Central Park, in the Hotel St.Regis, room 1607, for the years 1920-1923.17 Commuting to Milwaukee and payingan exorbitant fifteen dollars a day in rent, the inventor neglected tocompensate the hotel for a seven-month period and was promptly sued for thebalance, over $3,000.18 Forced to find other premises, he moved into the HotelMarguery on Park Avenue and Fortyeighth Street, just a few blocks from hisfavorite stomping grounds: Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, andthe great commuter’s hall at Grand Central Station. After hours, in the dead ofnight, the inventor would grab his coat, cane, white gloves, and derby andprance out for a tour of the park by the library, where he cogitated and fed hisprecious pigeons. Rumors began spreading about the gaunt eccentric who fed thepigeons, as Tesla purposely kept his identity concealed. “Midnight is the hourhe chooses for his visits…Tall, well dressed, of dignified bearing [the man]whistles several times, a signal for the pigeons on the ledges of the buildingto flutter down about his feet. With a generous hand, the man scatters peanutson the lawn from a bag. A proud man, yet humble in his charities—NikolaTesla.”19According to several researchers, Tesla was a homosexual, and it was supposedlythere, in the Hotel Marguery, that he liked to meet “his special friends.” Morelikely a celibate, the inventor did have one homosexual admirer, the youngjournalist Kenneth Swezey.20Born in 1905 and raised in a Brooklyn apartment, where he stayed his whole life,Swezey had constructed his first radio at the age of thirteen, during the heightof World War I. Shortly thereafter, forsaking secondary school, he began towrite science articles for a number of the local newspapers and magazines andeventually a textbook on chemistry. Able to reduce complex ideas to a levelunderstandable by the masses, Swezey was later congratulated by Albert Einsteinfor explaining Archimedes’ principle.21Having sifted through the data on the wireless, Swezey came to realize thatTesla was the unsung author of the invention and sought the hermit out for aninterview.With a round, boyish face, glasses, and a quick and perceptive mind, Swezeyquickly endeared himself to Tesla, who expressed surprise at the writer’s youth.Only nineteen at the time, Swezey and Tesla began a special friendship thatwould last until the end of the inventor’s life. Often they would meet inTesla’s apartment to go over some articles Swezey was writing or to discussaspects of Tesla’s work. Afterward, the youngster might join the inventor fordinner, or Tesla would walk the boy back to the gate of the subway.22 As thefriendship grew, the aging sage also came to rely on Swezey when he neededassistance, and by the time he was in his late seventies, their friendshipbecame so familiar that, according to Swezey, Tesla sometimes greeted him at thedoor stark naked. As the years progressed, Tesla’s new publicist becamevirtually one of the family, befriending Agnes Holden, Robert Johnson’sdaughter, and also Sava Kosanovic, Tesla’s nephew, who often traveled to NewYork from the newly formed Yugoslavia as its first ambassador.Swezey, who himself described Tesla as “an absolute celibate,” began to compilea large holding of articles, letters, and original manuscripts as he raced,unwittingly, Jack O’Neill, Tesla’s other journalist-compadre, to write thequintessential biography. Concerning Tesla’s habits, Swezey confirmed that theinventor rarely slept. Tesla claimed he slept less than two hours per night. Theinventor, however, did admit to “dozing” from time to time “to recharge hisbatteries.” For exercise, the inventor would walk “8-10 miles per day” and alsoloosen up in the bathtub (although he also touted a waterless bath whichinvolved charging his body with electricity in such a way as to repel allforeign particles). Later, Tesla would add to his repertoire the squishing andunsquishing of his toes one hundred times for each foot every night. He claimedthe practice stimulated his brain cells. “And how this man worked! I will tellyou about a little episode…I was sleeping in my room like one dead. It was threeafter midnight. Suddenly the telephone ring awakened me. Through my sleep Iheard his voice, “Swezey, how are you, what are you doing?” This was one of manyconversations in which I did not succeed in participating. He spoke animatedly,with pauses, [as he]…work[ed] out a problem, comparing one theory to another,commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closedthe telephone.”23In 1926, shortly after moving to the Hotel Pennsylvania, the inventor agreed toan interview for Colliers magazine. The sixty-eight-year-old philosopher choseas his topic of the evening the female of the species. Viewing the woman’smovement as “one of the most profound portents of the future,” the “tall, thin,ascetic man” told the interviewer, “This struggle of the human female toward sexequality will end in a new sex order, with the female as superior.”24 Happy withthe article, Tesla forwarded a copy to Anne Morgan, with whom he still kept intouch and Anne wrote back to review her own twenty-year odyssey as an advocatein the women’s movement.25During this same time period Tesla divulged in the World his unbridledattachment to the city’s pigeons. “Sometimes I feel that by not marrying I madetoo great a sacrifice to my work,” he told the reporter, “so I have decided tolavish all the affection of a man no longer young on the feathery tribe. I amsatisfied if anything I do will live for posterity. But to care for thosehomeless, hungry or sick birds is the delight of my life. It is my only means ofplaying.”In the same article, Tesla poignantly reveals a fondness for one particularpigeon that had a broken wing and leg. “Using all my mechanical knowledge, Iinvented a device by which I supported its body in comfort in order to let thebones heal.” Carrying the bird up to his suite, Tesla calculated that “it costme more than $2,000 to cure [her].” It took over a year and one-half of dailycare, and afterward Tesla hand-carried the bird to one of his favorite farms,where “it is now one of the finest and prettiest birds I have ever seen.”26Concerning his potential affinity for males, Tesla certainly displayed anaffection for muscle men, often, in the later years, inviting boxers such asHenry Doherty, Jimmy Adamick, and the Yugoslav welterweight champion FritzieZivic out to dinner or to his apartment.27 Having “made a study” of the 1892championship match between Gentleman Jim Corbett and John L. Sullivan (which hadbeen held in New Orleans), Tesla made the sports headlines in 1927 by predictingthe outcome of the rematch between Gene Tunney and Jack Dempsey, the “ManassaMauler” having been deposed the year before in a ten-round decision.> DR.

He is a lifelong bachelor.28With Katharine’s death came a new level of intimacy between Tesla and Luka.Often they would meet for dinner or at the cinema, and when Spanish-American Warhero Richmond P. Hobson returned with his wife to live in the city, he wouldjoin them. According to Mrs. Hobson, “these two dear friends [Tesla and Hobson],about once a month or sometimes oftener, would meet and go to a movie and thensit in the Park, and talk till after midnight! Richmond always came home withenthusiasm over some new invention of Tesla’s and well I recall the night hetold Richmond, ‘I can shake the world of its orbit, but I won’t do it,Hobson!’”29Certainly Tesla’s relationship with Katharine had been, at least at one time,provocative, and no doubt he reviewed details with Hobson, but apparently,according to his own words, he had “never touched a woman.”30 One could make acase for a germ phobia, although his relationship with the pigeons would seem todispel that myth, magnified greatly by the O’Neill biography;31 or Tesla’saversion to sexual intimacy with women could be evaluated from a psychoanalyticperspective. In 1924, Tesla wrote in a condolence note to Jack Morgan, “Themother’s loss grips one’s head more powerfully than any other sad experience inlife.”32image 33 [images/image-33.jpg]Tesla’s reactive jet dirigible, circa 1909.

These included (a)a machine for harnessing cosmic rays; (b) a means for transmitting mechanicalenergy; (c) a particle-beam weapon; and (d) a mechanism for communicating withother planets. In addition, Tesla also continued to refer to (e) hisWardenclyffe idea. The identification of each separate invention became asomewhat confusing task for journalists and researchers because each of theseideas involves the transmission of energy to distant places; and the thirdinvention, the so-called death ray apparently, in its final form, comprisedfeatures from some, if not all, of the other inventions.Throughout Tesla’s seventies, that is, from the mid-1920s until about 1934,Tesla continued his practice of traveling to industrial centers throughout theNortheast and Midwest in his quest to market his wares. While commuting toPhiladelphia during the years 1924-25 to work on his gasoline turbine (he hadworked on the steam turbine in Chicago and Milwaukee), Tesla met with John B.Flowers, inspector of airplanes and engines at the local naval aircraft factory.He had known the inspector since 1917.2 As it became more apparent that thebladeless turbine was stuck in the endless cycle of research and development,Tesla returned to his first love, wireless transmission of power, and began apublicity campaign to espouse its merits. By implementing a series of centralstations to pump energy into the ground and surrounding medium, the ultimateconservationist-pragmatist theorized that airplanes and automobiles, equippedwith specially designed receiving devices, could operate without fuel onboard;they would simply derive their power from his towers.On October 10, 1925, Flowers traveled to New York City to confer with the wizardin his suite at the Hotel Pennsylvania. There they drafted out the entire schemeso that it could be presented to physicist J. H. Dillinger, head of the RadioLaboratory, Bureau of Standards, in Washington, D.C.In a carefully worded ten-page document, complete with schematic drawings of theearth imbued with Tesla-created standing waves, Flowers unveiled a plan foroperating cars and planes powered by electromagnetism. “Dr. Tesla said that theWireless Power System would supply power to airplanes at any point around theearth,” Flowers told Dillinger. “In addition,” Flowers continued, “Dr. Tesla hasalready developed the oscillator to provide the power and is willing to furnishthe U.S. Government his plans if they agree to build the plant.” Flowers alsoset up a meeting in Washington to go over the proposal.In the interim, Dillinger referred the proposal to H. L. Curtis, a fellowexpert. After canny consideration, Curtis rejected the plan, his main objectionbeing that “as he understood it, Tesla’s scheme was to create standingelectrical waves around the earth as a sphere. There would then be considerableconcentration of energy at the nodes and it was at the nodal points Teslaexpected to develop his energy. The system proposed by Mr. Flowers does not havethis feature. He proposes to collect energy at any point…[Thus] some means wouldhave to be devised for concentrating this energy and making it available. Nosuch method is proposed, and I do not think of any that appearsfeasible…[Furthermore] I do not know of any wireless apparatus…of sufficientmagnitude to warrant the expectation that power can be economically transmittedby radio methods.”3The basic criticism that the energy would not be available at any point of theglobe, but only at the nodal points, was countered on numerous occasions byTesla (although, apparently, the towers, which were not near power sources,would have to be placed at nodal points). One of Tesla’s favorite analogies wasto view electricity as a kind of fluid and his magnifying transmitters as aseries of pumps. Just as with a hydraulic system the fluid would be present atall points in equal pressures, so, too, would Tesla’s electrical oscillations.And just as electrical energy is present at every connected electrical outlet inthe world but is not used until an appliance is plugged in, so, too, was Tesla’selectricity available, but not used until the receiver was turned on.In a comprehensive article published in Telegraph & Telephone Age in October1927, which was probably written as a rebuttal to Curtis and Dillinger, Teslaalso explains that the oscillations would spread from the magnifying transmitter> with a theoretically infinite speed, slowing down first very quickly and> afterward at a lesser rate until the distance is about six thousand miles,> when it proceeds with the speed of light. From there on it again increases in> speed, slowly at first, and then more rapidly, reaching the antipode with> approximately infinite velocity. The law of motion can be expressed by stating> that the waves on the terrestrial surface sweep in equal intervals of time> over equal areas, but it must be understood that the current penetrates deep> into the earth and the effects produced on the receivers are the same as if> the whole flow was confined to the earth’s axis joining the transmitter with> the antipode. The mean surface speed is thus about 471,200 kilometers per> second—57% greater than that of the so-called Hertz waves.4Tesla likened the effect to the moon’s shadow spreading over the earth during aneclipse. Here was the first of a number of instances in which Tesla disagreedwith the findings of Einstein’s theory of relativity, as the so-called Teslawave supposedly traveled faster than light.5In 1928, Tesla traveled to Philadelphia to attempt construction of hishelicopter-airplane, probably with John Flowers, and to Detroit to try to marketit as a “flying automobile” to GM. On a more practical level, he also peddledhis speedometer to the Ford Motor Company.One of the problems in the speedometer was cost, the Tesla invention havingbecome a premium item only found in the more expensive vehicles. He also visitedwith his nephew Nicholas Trbojevich, who was helping fund the helicopter, andwho was on the verge of becoming very wealthy from his various automobileinventions associated with economizing the transmission and steering.Trbojevich, like his uncle, was somewhat of a workaholic, and Tesla cautionedhis wife to give her husband “unceasing care [and love],” as in the long run“your husband is sure to acquire great wealth and when his battle is won, youwill have everything to your heart’s desire.”6Shortly after, Tesla returned to Detroit and met Trbojevich for a late snack atthe Book-Cadillac Hotel, the city’s “finest.” According to William Terbo, “themaitre d’ suggested they wait five minutes, when the five dollar cover chargewould be lifted. Tesla would hear none of it and marched in.” As this was duringthe Great Depression, when a quarter could buy three hot dogs and two cokes,this wasted expense was enormous, and it became a great point for laughter amongthe Trbojevich family, which tended to view Tesla as simply their old eccentricuncle rather than one of the most important inventors in the world. When thenephew tried tactfully to bring up the matter of the cover charge, Tesla evadedby responding, “I’ll never die rich unless the money comes in the door fasterthan I can shovel it out the window.”7During this period (1925-38) Tesla also negotiated with Myron Taylor, CEO ofU.S. Steel. Interested in the steel company for a variety of reasons, theever-prodigious inventor had developed special equipment for purifying ores,“degasification of steel,” and also conservation of sulphur during ironprocessing. In the late 1920s he asked Taylor if he could install equipment tosee if the procedure worked. Taylor agreed, and so Tesla traveled up to theirWorcester plant in September 1931 to install it. Although he hoped for asuccessful demonstration, this apparently did not occur, since the archives ofU.S. Steel have only one short paragraph referring to Tesla’s dealings with thecompany.8 Tesla’s ultimate plan, which apparently was not tested, was to installhis bladeless turbine in the heat exhaust system, with the idea of convertingthe enormous amount of wasted heat into useful electricity. Ever theconservationist, this was one of Tesla’s most elegant ideas.From Worcester, Tesla moved on to Buffalo for a top-secret experiment, accordingto Peter Savo, a cousin living in New York. There the inventor reportedlyrefitted an automobile that, according to the story, ran on electrical powerfrom an outside source.> The car [was] a standard Pierce Arrow, with the engine removed and certain> other components installed instead. The standard clutch, gear box, and drive> train remained…Under the hood, there was a brushless electric motor, connected> to [or in place of] the engine…Tesla would not divulge who made the motor.> > Set into the dash was a “power receiver” consisting of a box…containing 12> radio tubes…A vertical antenna, consisting of a 6 ft. rod, was installed and> connected to the power receiver [which was] in turn, connected to the motor by> two heavy, conspicuous cables…Tesla pushed these in before starting and said:> “We now have power.”9If this tale is to be believed, it would mean that Tesla had also installed oneof his powerful oscillators somewhere near Niagara Falls to provide the wirelessenergy needed to power the vehicle. An alternative possibility was that Teslawas testing one of his gasoline or steam turbines in the automobile, and Savomistook it for the wireless device. “The aging inventor, a tall, thin, almostspiritual figure in the sort of brown cutaway suit that older men wore beforethe World War, received interviewers in one of the public rooms in the Hotel NewYorker, where he lives. Before he would speak of his present work, he reviewedhis past achievements, which entitle him more than Edison, Steinmetz or anyother, to be called the father of the power age…”10There was a new king of the hill. Ever since the 1919 confirmation of his theoryof relativity, that space was curved and that light traveled at a constant speedirrespective of the movement of its source, Einstein began to occupy the spotformerly held by such technical wizards as Bell, Edison, the Wright brothers, orTesla. First postulated in 1905, Einstein’s theories not only shifted theprevailing space-time paradigm, that self-assuring Newtonian world that the oldguard grew up in; his theories also threatened Tesla’s position as premiermastermind. Although the measurement of the starlight bending around the sunduring the 1919 eclipse was experimental proof of Einstein’s new postulate,” forthe most part the theoretical physicist was exactly that, a theorist, whereasTesla, as hands-on creator of new technologies, was able to prove out hisassumptions in the everyday world. This was the inventor’s advantage, and heused it to attack the new Nobel Prize-winning upstart.As Einstein’s theory abandoned the old nineteenth-century ether, it explainedthe bending of light rays around large bodies as being caused by thenon-Euclidean curving of space-time. This, in essence, became the new and moreabstract ether. Mathematical equations accurately predicted the precise amountof bending that occurred. “In general relativity, the gravitational field andthe structure or geometry of space are identical…The gravitational field is thecurved space.”12Tesla completely disagreed with the concept of space being curved, saying thatit was “self-contradictory.” Since “every action is accompanied by an equivalentreaction,” it appeared to Tesla’s “simple mind…[that] the curved spaces mustreact on the bodies and, producing the opposite effect, straighten out thecurves.” To Tesla, the light bent because the large body (e.g., the sun) had aforce field which influenced it.13Ironically, Einstein’s contemporaries at the Carnegie Institution of Washingtonwere using the Tesla coil in their new 1929 experiments in attempting to splitthe atom,14 while Tesla was discussing a more esoteric source of energy, cosmicrays:> A principle by which power for driving the machinery of the world may be> derived from the cosmic energy which operates the universe, has been> discovered by Nikola Tesla, noted physicist and inventor…> > This principle, which taps a source of power described as “everywhere present> in unlimited quantities” and which may be transmitted by wire or wireless from> central plants to any part of the globe, will eliminate the need of coal, oil,> gas or any other of the common fuels…“The central source of cosmic energy for> the earth is the sun,” Dr. Tesla said, but “night will not interrupt the flow> of the new power supply.”15On July 10, 1931, Tesla turned seventy-five. Time honored the senior inventor byplacing his portrait on the cover. Tesla’s life was briefly reviewed, and hismost recent mysterious research on harnessing “an entirely new and unsuspectedsource [of energy]” was discussed. Unwilling to reveal more about the adjuvant,the venerated iconoclast startled the interviewer by referring obliquely to hismost esoteric invention, the “Teslascope,” a device for signaling the nearbystars: “I think that nothing can be more important than interplanetarycommunication. It will certainly come some day, and the certitude that there areother human beings in the universe, working, suffering, struggling likeourselves, will produce a magic effect on mankind, and will form the foundationof a universal brotherhood that will last as long as humanity itself.”16 HugoGernsback couldn’t have said it better.Simultaneously, Kenneth Swezey wrote a flurry of letters to every notable hecould think of, requesting a birthday greeting. Accolades poured in (many quotedthroughout this text) from E. F. Alexanderson, B. A. Behrend, W. H. Bragg, LeeDe Forest, Gano Dunn, Jack Hammond, A. E. Kennelly, Arthur Korn, Oliver Lodge,Robert Millikan, D. McFarlan Moore, Valdemar Poulsen, Charles F. Scott, GeorgGraf von Arco, H. H. Westinghouse, and Albert Einstein. VIPs who wrote back todecline included Guglielmo Marconi and Michael Pupin.17By October, Thomas Alva Edison was dead; the lights in the city were dimmed inhonor of the great man’s passing. Perhaps it was the death of his nemesis or thenew round of adulation, or Tesla’s advanced age that prompted him to alter hisstyle of avoiding publicity. Whatever the reason, from 1931 on the inventor madeit an annual practice on his birthday to invite the press to his flat andannounce his latest discoveries. With the talent of a mystery writer, theelectrician stretched out the secrets of his various creations, revealing just alittle more each year.By 1935, on his seventy-ninth birthday, Tesla, although exceedingly gaunt, wasstill exuberant and expected to live past 110. His mind ever evolving, thesorcerer utilized this occasion to lay out in considerable detail the variousparticulars of a number of his more exotic creations. With movie cameras rollingand the inventor “treating the press, about 30 in number, to a gourmet’sluncheon…Mr. Tesla sat at the head of the table.” Eating little more than breadand warm milk, which he heated up in a chafing dish at the table, the wizardtalked while the reporters “feasted.”18> INVENTOR, 81, TALKS OF KEY TO> INTERSTELLAR TRANSMISSION> > & Tube to Produce Radium Copiously and Cheaply> > > > Reports of discoveries by which it will be possible to communicate with the> planets and to produce radium in unlimited quantities for $1 a pound were> announced by Dr. Nikola Tesla yesterday on his 81st birthday at which he was> honored with high orders from the Yugoslav and Czechoslovak Governments…> > “I am expecting to put before the Institute of France an accurate description> of the devices with data and calculations and claim the Pierre Guzman prize of> 100,000 francs for means of communication with other worlds, feeling perfectly> sure that it will be awarded to me.

This discovery of mine will be remembered when everything else I> have done, is covered with dust.”19In discussing this invention, one runs into murky waters, for it appears thatTesla tied the concept of the radium-producing tube to the interplanetarycommunicator. These, however, may be two unrelated creations. Another problemwas that the inventor was also discussing at this time the idea of capturingcosmic rays that travel at velocities fifty times greater than that of light. Ifthis invention utilized cosmic rays, it would imply that Tesla planned totranscend the speed of light and communicate with other stars.In reading the text carefully, it appears that Tesla does not mention otherstars but, rather, the planets, which are relatively close to the earth;furthermore, he does not really discuss communicating with extraterrestrials somuch as transmitting energy. It is known that as early as 1918, while workingwith Coleman Czito’s son, Julian, the inventor was bouncing laserlike pulses offthe moon and testing some type of “scope.”20 Therefore, it is possible that hewas working on more than one device to send energy into outer space.Verification for Tesla that there existed particles that traveled faster thanthe speed of light were purportedly discovered in the late 1890s when heinvented a device to capture radiant energy. The machine, patented on November5, 1901, comprised, in essence, an insulated plate, resembling a fly swatter,made out of “the best quality of mica as dielectric.” This was attached to acondenser. Stemming from his work with radiant energy, X rays, and Lenard tubes,the device could also capture what he called cosmic rays.21> I made some progress in solving the mystery until in 1899 I obtained> mathematical and experimental proofs that the sun and other heavenly bodies> similarly conditioned emit rays of great energy which consist of inconceivably> small particles animated by velocities vastly exceeding that of light. So> great is the penetrative power of these rays that they can traverse thousands> of miles of solid matter with but slight diminution of velocity. In passing> through space, which is filled with cosmic dust, they generate a secondary> radiation of constant intensity, day or night, and pouring upon the earth> equally from all directions.22Since Victor Hess’s discovery in 1911 and Robert Millikan’s confirmation, therehave been many scientists who have measured cosmic rays. We now know thatemitted uncharged elementary particles known as neutrinos possess thepenetrative powers suggested by Tesla, but no researcher, to my knowledge, hasdiscovered rays that transcend the speed of light. This supposed finding ofTesla also violated relativity.Tesla was insistent that such particles did exist; he saw them as a source whichcould be converted into electrical power. During the summer of 1932 he told JackO’Neill that he had “harnessed the cosmic rays and caused them to operate amotive device…The attractive features of the cosmic rays is their constancy.They shower down on us through the whole 24 hours, and if a plant is developedto use their power, it will not require devices for storing energy, as would benecessary with devices using wind, tide or sunlight.” When pressed for moredetails, Tesla revealed that he would tell O’Neill “in a general way [theirmodus operandi…] The cosmic rays ionize the air, setting free many charges—ionsand electrons. These charges are captured in a condenser which is made todischarge through the circuit of the motor.” Tesla also told O’Neill that he“had hopes of building such a motor on a large scale.”23FREE ENERGY?As the years rolled on, it became a challenge for reporters to wrestle moredetails about each invention from the wizened prestidigitator, since Teslacontinued to maintain his perpetual reticence about revealing particulars.Concerning the cosmic-ray accumulator, the reporters were able collectively topry from the inventor the following: “My power generator will be of the simplestkind—just a big mass of steel, copper and aluminum, comprising a stationary androtating part, peculiarly assembled…Such a source of power obtainable everywherewill solve many problems with which the human race is confronted…[The] machineryfor harnessing it would last more than 5,000 years.”24Cosmic rays, he asserted, are produced by the force of “electrostaticrepulsion”; they consist of powerfully charged positive particles which come tous from the sun and other suns in the universe. He determined, “afterexperimentation,” that the sun is charged “with an electric potential ofapproximately 215,000,000,000 volts.”25> Owing to its immense charge, the sun imparts to minute positively electrified> particles prodigious velocities which are governed only by the ratio between> the quantity of free electricity carried by the particles and their mass, some> attaining a speed exceeding fifty times that of light…> > At great altitudes, the intensity of the rays is more than 10,000% greater> than at sea level…The energy of the cosmic radiations impinging upon the earth> from all sides is stupendous, such that if all of it were converted into heat> the globe quickly would be melted and volatilized…Rising air> currents…partially neutralize [their intensity]…Those who are still doubting> that our sun emits powerful cosmic rays evidently overlook that the solar> disk, in whatever position it may be in the heavens, cuts off the radiations> from beyond, replacing them by its own.26Coupled with his view that all bodies in the universe obtain their energy fromexternal sources, and possibly influenced by Walter Russell, an artist,philosopher, and longtime friend of Tesla’s who hypothesized that the periodictable of elements was constructed in a hierarchical spiral of octaves, Tesla was“led to the inescapable conclusion that such bodies as the sun are taking onmass much more rapidly than they are dissipating it by the dissipation of energyin heat and light.”27 Similarly, radioactive decay was not caused by thedisintegration of the nucleus of the atom; rather, it was a “secondary effect ofexternal rays and two-fold—one part coming from the energy stored, the otherfrom that continuously supplied.”28 In other words, radioactive material was, toTesla, apparently a kind of conduit for the ever-present primary substance“Akasa,” which was being absorbed in such a way as to cause the emission of theradioactive material.These Tesla offerings would appear as evidence of a great mind gone astray, forthe various discoveries and suggestions inherent in Tesla’s theory violate notonly such accepted theories as relativity and quantum physics but also, on thesurface, common sense. The idea that the inventor could construct a simpledevice made up basically of a receiving plate and a condenser to provideelectricity to run motors from cosmic rays harks the reader back to the inanedays of the Keely motor and the obtuse concepts of perpetual motion and freeenergy. Yet underneath the veneer of the theory is an exciting notion that thesun is somehow absorbing energy from the universe and that there does exist someform of it which transcends the limiting factor of the speed of light. Called byother researchers tachyons (i.e., particles that travel faster than the speed oflight) and linked to other such concepts as black holes, worm holes, stringtheory nonlocality, the implicate order, hyperspace, gravitons, and Mach’sprinciple, Tesla’s theories, when viewed within the matrix of the bizarre newphysics, may not be so far-out.Another of Tesla’s discoveries involved the transmission of mechanical energy todistant places. By strategically placing one of his mechanical oscillators on,for example, solid bedrock, a mechanical impulse could be sent into the groundto accomplish “at least four practical possibilities. It would give the world anew means of unfailing communication; it would provide a new safe means forguiding ships at sea into port; furnish a kind of divining rod for locating oredeposits…; and finally, it would provide scientists with a means for laying barethe physical conditions of the earth.”29 The essential principle behind thisinvention is, of course, used today in sonar for ships and by geophysicists instudying the interior of the earth, mapping fault lines, studying the core, andso on.> TESLA, AT 78, BARES NEW ‘DEATH-BEAM’> > Dr. Tesla…has perfected a method and apparatus…which will send concentrated> beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they> will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 250 miles> from a defending nation’s border and will cause armies of millions to drop> dead in their tracks.30Tesla’s discovery of a death ray stems all the way back to his work in the early1890s with his creation of a button lamp that could bounce electrons off of acentral filament made of almost any substance (e.g., carbon, diamonds, zirconia,rubies) onto the interior of a self-reflective bulb and then bounce back to thesource. This device would not only produce an extraordinarily brilliant light,it could also “vaporize” the button. As stated previously, it was only a shortstep from this machine to the invention of the ruby laser. For instance, ifthere was a scratch or imperfection in the coating of the glass, the energywould stream out through this opening in laserlike fashion.In the late 1890s, Tesla was bombarding targets with X rays at distances inexcess of forty feet, and by 1915 he had announced in the New York Times a typeof electronic defensive shield which today corresponds to what has been calledSDI, or the Strategic Defense Initiative.HARRY GRINDELL-MATHEWSDuring World War I, another Teslarian, Harry Grindell-Mathews, was provided with25,000 pounds by the British government for the creation of a searchlight beamwhich he said could control aircraft. A wireless electrician and veteran of theBritish army, wounded at the turn of the century during the Boer War,Grindell-Mathews eventually refined this invention and changed it into a“diabolical ray.” This new electronic beam, he said, could not only destroyzeppelins and airplanes, but also immobilize marching armies and nauticalfleets. Although he would not divulge the specifics of his creation, he made nosecret of his admiration for Tesla, whose technologies had “inspired” itsgroundwork.In July 1924, Grindell-Mathews traveled to America to see an eye specialist. Heprobably met with Hugo Gernsback at that time and might also have visited Tesla.Staying at the Hotel Vanderbilt, the British inventor was interviewed by anumber of the local dailies. “Let me recall to you the air attacks on Londonduring the [world] war. Searchlights picked up the German raiders andilluminated them while guns fired, hitting some but more often missing them. Butsuppose instead of a searchlight you direct my ray? So soon as it touches theplane this bursts into flame and crashes to the earth.”31Grindell-Mathews was also convinced that the Germans had such a ray. They wereusing a high-frequency current of 200 kilowatts, which as of yet they were“unable to control.”Working with the French government in Lyons and performing successful testsbefore members of the British War Office, Grindell-Mathews instituteddestructive effects at distances of sixty feet but was hoping to extend theforce to a radius of six or seven miles. Asked for specifics, he said that hisdevice utilized two beams, one as a carrier ray and the other as the“destructive current.” The first beam would constitute a low frequency and wouldbe projected through a lens; the second, of a higher frequency, would increaseconductivity so that destructive power would be more easily transmitted. Themotor of an airplane, for instance, could be the “contact point” at which theparalyzing ray would do its handiwork. He admitted, however, that if the objectwere grounded, it would be protected against such a force.32Hugo Gernsback, along with Dr. W. Severinghouse, a physicist from ColumbiaUniversity, tried unsuccessfully to duplicate the effects using heat beams, Xrays, and ultraviolet rays. Doubting Grindell-Mathews’s claims, Gernsbacknevertheless featured the “diabolical ray” with characteristic Frank Paulianpanache on the cover of his magazine and with a series of exposés.33Leaders from other countries were less critical than Gernsback, and manyproclaimed that their scientists also had such diabolical rays. Herr Wulle, amember of the German Reichstag, announced that “three German scientists haveperfected apparatus that can bring down airplanes, halt tanks and spread acurtain of death like gas clouds of the recent war.” Not to be outdone, LeonTrotsky stated that the Soviets had also invented such a device. Warning allnations, Trotsky proclaimed, “I know the potency of Grammachikoffs ray, so letRussia alone!”34This theme of all-powerful efficient weaponry reappeared during the 1930s as theseeds of World War II were sown. At this time, Tesla began to reveal more andmore about his own diabolical ray as he criticized the Grindell-Mathews scheme.“It is impossible to develop such a ray,” [Dr. Tesla says]. “I worked on thatidea for many years before my ignorance was dispelled and I became convincedthat it could not be realized. This new beam of mine consists of minute bulletsmoving at a terrific speed, and any amount of power desired can be transmittedby them. The whole plant is just a gun, but one which is incomparably superiorto the present.” The inventor further claimed that the new weapon, which was tobe used for defense only, comprised “four new inventions”: (1) an apparatus forproducing the rays; (2) a process for producing immense electrical power; (3) amethod for amplifying the power; and (4) a tremendous electrical repellingforce.35Working in two undisclosed locations, including a secret laboratory under theFifty-ninth Street Bridge, near Second Avenue,36 Tesla perfected hisparticle-beam weapon, as he conspired with unabashed anarchist and architectTitus deBobula, to design the all-purpose power plant that could generate highvoltages or capture cosmic rays and convert them into his defensive electronicshield.37 Believing that entire countries could be protected by such plants, theinventor clandestinely approached the war departments of each of the Allies withhis scheme."},{"pageContent":"45LIVING ON CREDIT (1925-40) [002-toc.html#ch45]> If you mean the man who really invented, in other words, originated and> discovered—not merely improved what had already been invented by others, then> without a shade of doubt, Nikola Tesla is the world’s greatest inventor, not> only at present, but in all history.> > HUGO GERNSBACK1Tesla was leading a double life in his later years, one as the elegant anthor ofthe electrical power system and father of the wireless and another, morelabyrinthe existence as the quintessential mad scientist whose ultimatecreations would rule not only the earth but other worlds as well.In 1935, with the help of newsreel photographers, Tesla designed and produced anelectrified extravaganza which he offered to Paramount Pictures. “Paramount saidthe film came out unusually good, both in respect to pictorial and soundeffects,” he told George Scherff, “but they feel that the subject was tootechnical.”2 Nevertheless, Teslaic themes continued to make their way into themass consciousness. The most important movie person to implement the inventor’swizardry was revolutionary movie producer Carl Laemmle and his special-effectsexpert Kenneth Strickfadden. Together, they unleashed one of Tesla’sunforgettable coils in the Boris Karloff classic Frankenstein. (Strickfaddenalso resurrected the same paraphernalia forty years later when Mel Brooksrecreated the set for the spoof Young Frankenstein.)3 Tesla was partial toLaemmle, whom he referred to as a genius, because Laemmle, too, successfullyfought the powerful Edison clique a generation earlier when Edison held amonopoly on key movie making patents and would not allow competitors to usethem. Routing his product through Europe, Laemmle was able to withstand morethan 200 legal actions against him to create Universal Pictures and therebydefeat Edison.4Hugo Gernsback, of course, also continued to espouse Teslaic motifs in ScienceWonder Stories5 with such fresh galactic escapades as “The Mightiest Machine,”“Interplanetary Bridges,” and “A City on Neptune.”Other apostles, such as John Hays Hammond Jr. and Edwin Armstrong, were ridingout the Great Depression living like kings. Hammond’s castle, throughout the1930s, became a haven for Hollywood stars, corporate giants, and virtuosos; theretreat also doubled as a top-secret military think tank.As Tesla continued to work at his hideaway by the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge,Edwin Armstrong continued to engage in a never-ending court battle with Lee DeForest over the invention of the heterodyne. Holding eighty thousand shares ofRCA stock, Armstrong was powerful enough to ride out the litigation as hecontinued to design a variety of new patents. Starting up his own radio station,Armstrong unveiled his newest invention, FM radio, a novel system which reducedsuch problems as static caused by ground interference so often encountered withAM. Little did Armstrong know that the litigation caused by this latest creationwould make the De Forest trial seem like a kindergarten spat.6Getting on in years, Tesla decided to hire a few Western Union boys to feed thepigeons for him. Dressed in their official caps and snappy uniforms, the ladscould be seen like clockwork at 9:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. at three differentlocations around the city: in front of the New York Public Library, in BryantPark, at the library’s rear, and at St. Patrick’s Cathedral.7 The inventor hadconstructed special wooden cages complete with a birdbath for taking care ofwounded as well as healthy feathered friends, and he befriended other dovefanciers to whom he could deliver the birds.In 1925, Tesla’s office was moved from 8 West Fortieth Street, near the New YorkPublic Library, to fashionable quarters at 350 Madison Avenue. His secretaries,Dorothy Skerrett and Muriel Arbus, during the later years, shared duties withSlavic professor Paul (Rado) Radosavljevich, from New York University, whoedited Tesla’s articles and screened incoming visitors.8 By 1928, however, theupkeep on the office had become too burdensome, and Tesla closed it for good.All of his holdings, consisting of thirty trunks, including his pricelesscorrespondence, theoretical papers, and prototype inventions, were carted to thebasement of the Hotel Pennsylvania, and that is where they remained untilNovember 21, 1934, when he transferred them to the Manhattan Storage Warehouse,located at Fifty-second Street and Seventh Avenue.9A contented member of the cognoscenti who had lived a life full of triumph wasmerely the persona, for underneath the appearance Tesla was often bitter,seeking an essentially solitary existence, displacing his anger in editorialsthat lashed out at Edison and Marconi and on unfortunate hotel managers who hadto contend with the thought of throwing the grand master out on his coattailsfor not paying his rent. In 1930, Tesla was escorted out of the HotelPennsylvania after residents complained about the interminable droppings fromhis “flying rats,” and because he was “$2000 behind in his rent.”10 As B. A.Behrend quietly reimbursed the hotel to the best of his abilities, the inventorhired a crew to cart his beloved avian companions to George Scherff’s home northof the city. Escaping their confinement, the pigeons returned to Manhattan justin time to move in with Tesla at his new abode, the Hotel Governor Clinton.11Working on a variety of new fronts, Tesla entered a furtive realm which wouldput him in touch with a series of nefarious agents and heads of manygovernments. Naturally, he required funds, for he began to lag behind yet againin his rent.When he stopped by Hugo Gernsback’s office for another twenty dollars,12 thescience-fiction editor showed Tesla an article on Westinghouse’s new radiomachinery. Realizing that this company was essentially pirating his wirelesspatents, Tesla strode into their offices and demanded royalty payments. He metwith Victor Beam, assistant to the vice president.“It would be painful to me to resort to legal proceedings against a greatcorporation whose business is largely founded on my inventions,” the inventorstated matter-of-factly, “and I trust that you will recognize the advantage ofan amicable understanding.”“Which statement do you claim to be an infringement?” Beam replied, feigningnaïevté.“Statement!” Tesla shot back. “Surely you must admit that my claim is toopalpably evident to be denied.”Beam inquired as to a price for purchasing Tesla’s wireless patent no.1,119,732, but it was really a stall tactic, as no genuine offer was made. Inexasperation, Tesla went home to draft a technical letter spelling out each andevery infringement of his fundamental work and concluded: “We [Charles Scott andTesla] have offered this revolutionary invention repeatedly virtually on yourown terms and you did not want it. You have preferred to take it by force. Youhave robbed me of the credit that is due and injured me seriously in business.Instead of showing a willingness to adjust the matter in an equitable way, yousay you want to fight. You may think you can secure an advantage by suchmatters, but we doubt it, and certainly they will not meet with public approvalwhen all the facts are published.”13One of the problems Tesla had to deal with was the continuing legacy ofresentment toward him by some members of the corporation. Unfortunately, one ofthe key antagonists was Andrew W. Robertson, a Westinghouse official who wouldsoon become chairman of the company. Just a few years later, while Tesla wasstill alive, Robertson came to write a small treatise on the AC polyphase systemfor the 1939 World’s Fair. In it, he neatly sidestepped any clear mention ofTesla’s role in the development of the system, suggesting, rather, that WilliamStanley was the inventor. Robertson even had the audacity to write thefollowing:> In George Westinghouse’s time, an inventor was recognized as owner of his> ideas and was given a patent to protect him in that ownership. Now we are told> that patents are evil monopolies, used to prevent people from getting the full> benefits of an individual’s work. If we are thinking clearly, we must draw the> conclusion that these signs all point to a common hostility against the…great> inventor…If this hostility continues, it cannot but result in an environment> certain to interfere with the growth and development of individual research> and inventiveness.14Here is a classic case of the Freudian defense mechanism known as projection,whereby one’s real feelings are attributed to others: Robertson suggests thatcommon people resent the great inventor when in fact it is really he who harborsthis resentment. Tesla had first offered his wireless patents to the company inthe early 1920s; a long time elapsed before the issue was resolved.As Tesla continued to make headlines for his invention of a diabolical ray, healso was becoming more and more adept at slipping past the manager of theGovernor Clinton. If he had to wait for Westinghouse to come through, so wouldthe hotel.Tesla was now working with the notorious architect and arms merchant TitusdeBobula, whose offices were located at 10 East Forty-third Street; deBobula washired to design the tower, power plant, and housing for the inventor’s“impenetrable shield between nations.”“We can project destructive energy in thread-like beams as far as a telescopecan discern an object,” said the seventy-eight-year-old inventor. “Dr. Tesla’sdeath ray can annihilate an army 200 miles away. It can penetrate all but thethickest armor plate, and a country’s whole frontier can be protected [withplants] producing these beams every 200 miles.” Dr. Tesla concluded: “The planeis thus absolutely eliminated as a weapon; it is confined to commerce.”15Born in 1878 in Hungary, with ties to Tesla probably through the Puskasbrothers, deBobula had emigrated to the United States during the Gay Nineties.At that time, Tesla “took the youth under his protection” and aided him inobtaining passage for a boat trip back to his homeland.16 Short and stocky instature, with a brush mustache and ruddy complexion, deBobula returned to theStates a few years later to study architecture. Having borrowed the money fromTesla ostensibly because he needed medical help in Budapest, deBobula hadactually returned home to help his father out in his moving business and becausehe wanted to complete other studies at the local “polytechnic.” Neverreimbursing the inventor for his aid and having lied about his real intentions,deBobula apologized and appealed for funds once more, in 1901. Writing fromMarietta, Ohio, where he was attempting to design a church and school for aparish, he requested “$70 or $80.” Perhaps in lieu of repayment, the newarchitect offered to draw up plans for the laboratory at Wardenclyffe, but thisassignment had already been undertaken by Stanford White.17At about 1908, deBobula moved to Pittsburgh, where he met and married EuranaMock, niece of Bethlehem Steel czar Charles Schwab. Shortly thereafter, hedesigned and built Schwab’s new mansion; he also secured loans from the steelmagnate to finance a series of real estate ventures.By 1910, deBobula was back in New York, earning his way by designing churchesand constructing large apartment buildings in Manhattan and the Bronx. Playingfast and loose with Schwab’s capital, deBobula returned to Ohio, where hecrossed the border into West Virginia and Kentucky to purchase eleven thousandacres.18 Now well connected, the Hungarian offered to set up a syndicate ofwealthy English steel men to help refinance Wardenclyffe, promising to raise amillion pounds “without going to very much trouble, providing, of course, thatwe could demonstrate things to them satisfactorily.” But Tesla declined theoffer and “resolved to fight my own battles.”19Known as a “racketeer,” having never paid taxes on the land deal, deBobula alsoreneged on a series of other loans. Naturally, Schwab became angry, particularlybecause he had lent deBobula additional monies to keep him out of debtor’sprison. Paradoxically, deBobula became interested in workers’ rights at thistime and in the growing anarchist movement.Seen as a gold digger and bully by Schwab, the wealthy financier was reported tohave said that “Bob is dishonest, and I would give a million dollars if he wouldjump out this window right now.” This event unleashed a powder keg of animositybetween the two, deBobula suing Schwab for $100,000 for defamation of character,Schwab severing connections between his niece and deBobula and the family.20Attracted to violent activities, deBobula continued to associate with a varietyof radical and paramilitary groups; he also caught the eye of the SecretService. In 1923, during a bizarre interlude, deBobula returned to his home inBudapest and aligned himself with a pro-Hitler group. There he authored a paperwhich attacked Jewish physics and espoused the developing new world order.Charged with conspiring to overthrow the Hungarian government, he escaped backto America.Throughout this entire period, deBobula would regularly correspond with Tesla todiscuss various ideas he had, such as how to perfect a projector bomb, which hehad a patent pending on, and he also discussed his latest encounter with a cabalof international warlords. The following letter suggests the possibility thatTesla’s attacking Einstein may have been prompted by anti-Semitic sentiments asmuch as by philosophical differences:> MUNITIONS INC.> 295 Madison Ave.> New York, NY> > > > My dear Mr. Tesla,> > I hugely enjoyed your comments on relativity, which we, way back in 1921,> attacked in my Budapest paper, as a theory of the fundamentals of which, if> logically developed, would inevitably lead to an anthropomorphic Jehovah with> all the evil trimmings in philosophy and social order.> > Yours sincerely,> Titus deBobula21In full support of Tesla’s desire to resurrect a new Wardenclyffe, deBobulacarefully drafted for Tesla blueprints of a 120-foot-tall teleforce powerhouseand transmission tower; at the same time, he set up a factory for his munitionscompany in New Jersey with Capt. Hans Tauscher. The tower, set up somewhat likea high-tech Van deGraaff generator, with Van deGraaffs primitive cardboard beltreplaced by a vacuum stream of ionized air, had at its bulbous apex aturret-rotating particle-beam cannon, able to move about to attack planes andairships with information provided by an earth-current radar system the wizardhad also designed during his days at Wardenclyffe.Tauscher, a German American, was closely linked with the Fatherland through hisdaughter, who still lived there. Through this and other channels, Tesla could beintroduced to potential weapons buyers. Simultaneously, he could also besupplied with small amounts of dynamite, which he used to test telegeodynamicequipment that he was trying to sell to such companies as Texaco Oil Company forgeophysical exploration.22Titus deBobula was now making his living selling rifle grenades, fragmentationand gas bombs, and other armaments to both domestic police departments andforeign governments in Europe and South America. Unfortunately for theHungarian, unwished-for newspaper publicity concerning a lawsuit with Tauscherdrew the attention of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Having hid hisrelationship with the munitions factory, deBobula not only attracted the taxcollectors but also the seemingly omniscient J. Edgar Hoover, who monitored hisactivities for the next ten years. He was accused of being a German agent andillegal alien involved in subversive activities, and Hoover “recommended that[deBobula] be considered for custodial detention in the event of a nationalemergency.”Although they maintained their relationship during this stormy period, Tesla’santennae were raised, especially when deBobula requested loans from him “inamounts you would not miss” just at the time he declared bankruptcy: DeBobulawas $750,000 in debt. Hoping to make Tesla a partner in the company, deBobularaised Tesla’s ire when he used his name as a reference when working an armsdeal with the minister of Paraguay. Tesla called deBobula and statedemphatically that he was not to use the inventor’s name.23Unable to maintain his Manhattan apartment, deBobula moved to the Bronx, wherehe was eventually arrested. A search of his apartment revealed an arsenal ofhand grenades, dynamite, and tear-gas bombs. The architect claimed that theywere simply part of the inventory from his company, and he was interrogated andreleased. Presumably an anti-Semite who apparently had ties to Henry Ford,deBobula disavowed any relationship to either the Communist party or theGerman-American Bund. Although he was monitored throughout the World War IIyears, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was unable to prove that he hadviolated any federal statute, and deBobula was allowed to move to Washington,D.C., where he set up another munitions arsenal right in the heart of the city!In 1949 he wrote directly to J. Edgar Hoover to “get them off his back,” andapparently Hoover complied, as articles and references to him faded away at thattime.24As the Great Depression wore on, Tesla’s expenses continued to mount. He was now$400 in debt to the hotel, which, during those dreary days, was a considerablesum. Cornered by the management, the sly conceptualist fell back on a strategemthat had worked so well when he was at the Waldorf-Astoria: he would live oncredit. He thereupon offered as collateral “a working model” of his death ray,which he told the establishment was worth $10,000. They asked for a receipt inwriting, and he agreed. The treacherous device and his note were carefullyplaced in locker no. 103 in the hotel’s back-room vault.25Although he had solved the problem of meeting the rent, Tesla’s finances werestill in a precarious state. He was even having trouble coming up with thefifteen dollars per month storage costs at the Manhattan Storage Warehouse. In1934, with a bitter taste in his mouth, he drafted a long letter to J. P. MorganJr. In it the inventor revealed that he has made overtures to sell his “Chinesewall of defense” to war departments in America and England. “The Russians arevery anxious to render their border safe against Japanese invasion, and I havemade them a proposal which is [also] being seriously considered.” The inventorwent on to acknowledge his outstanding debt to Morgan from the turbine affairand his willingness to pay back the sum, about $40,000, and then made an appeal.“If I had now $25,000 to secure my property and make convincing demonstrations,I could acquire in a short time colossal wealth.” Tesla ended the letter bylambasting FDR’s “New Deal,” which “poured out billions in public money [justso] it can remain in power indefinitely.” This “perpetual motion scheme,” inTesla’s view, was antidemocratic, “destructive to established industries, anddecidedly socialistic.”26Needless to say, Morgan did not lend Tesla any money. However, what isinteresting in this passage is Tesla’s reference to property he needed to securein order to make convincing demonstrations. This suggestion that he had, infact, erected a working death ray would become important later, when thequestion was raised whether a functioning model had actually been constructed.According to Hugo Gernsback, through to his prompting, the WestinghouseCorporation agreed to help their former champion out. Gernsback stated that hehad called up the Westinghouse officials “in the late 30’s…to discuss what couldbe done. I apprised [them] of the fact that Tesla was a very proud man who,under no circumstances, would consider charity. I suggested that perhaps hecould be put on the staff in an honorary capacity as a consultant. This wasagreed upon and from that time until his death…Tesla received a modestpension.”27Gernsback may certainly have called the company. However, his interpretation ofwhat occurred conflicts with the timing of the contract and the reasons for thedeal. Tesla had settled with Westinghouse about four years before thescience-fiction publisher’s gracious call. On legal footing, the inventorcontinued to press his case. Finally, on January 2, 1934, the president, F. A.Merrick, acquiesced and agreed to pay Tesla “to act as a consulting engineer for$125/month for such a period as may be mutually agreeable.”28 To solve the agingpatriarch’s psychological problem of refusing to pay his rent, Merrick alsoagreed to cover Tesla’s rent. The debt owed to the Hotel Governor was neversettled; rather, Tesla moved, after signing of the agreement to the Hotel NewYorker; and there he would live, so far as he was concerned, rent free to theend of his days.29"},{"pageContent":"46LOOSE ENDS (1931-43) [002-toc.html#ch46]> Then there appeared the vision of a man from a strange, new world.

A decadelater, Stoilkovic returned to America as an emissary of the Yugoslavianconsulate, and they became close friends for the next ten years. At the age ofninety, Stoilkovic would recall their visits.As with many other Serbs, Stoilkovic was unhappy about the split between Teslaand Pupin, and like others before him, he tried to bring the two men together.Perceiving Pupin as ungrateful and deeply hurt by his association with “thatdonkey” Marconi, Tesla wanted nothing to do with his fellow Serb.

Pupin2In Dunlap’s classic text Radio’s 100 Men of Science, the author writes, “Pupinwas a man of complete intellectual honesty; if he made an error in an equationon the blackboard, he would quickly admit the mistake, rub out the blunder andbegin again.”3We have discussed in the past Pupin’s insistence that many of Tesla’s inventionswere his own and how Pupin removed Tesla’s name from the discussion of thehistory of the AC polyphase system and of the wireless in his four-hundred-pagePulitzer Prize-winning autobiography, which he had dedicated to “the rise ofidealism as a qualified witness whose testimony had competence and weight.”4This tack also carried over to his legendary courses at Columbia University inwhich he camouflaged Tesla’s role in the etiology of a variety of inventions.“When Marconi came to New York, in 1927 to lecture…Dr. Pupin presided at theInstitute of Radio Engineers…‘Marconi, we love you,’ said Dr. Pupin; ‘we havecome not so much to hear what you have to say, but to see your boyish smile.’”5When Pupin became ill in 1935, he asked his secretary to go see Stoilkovic and“plead with him to get Tesla to visit Pupin in the hospital. He wanted to makepeace before he passed on.”Greeting Stoilkovic at the door in his favorite lounging outfit, a red robe withblue slippers, Tesla was taken aback by the request. He said he needed to sleepon the matter. The following day, he called his friend and said he would go ifStoilkovic would accompany him.> In Pupin’s room there were a few doctors alongside his bed.

Tesla attended the funeral.6Four years Tesla’s senior, Robert Underwood Johnson left for a tour of Englandas a widower in 1927 and went again to France and Italy in 1928. Tesla lent hisfriend $500 for the trip and $800 for the mortgage on his home. Upon his returnin 1929, Johnson joined Tesla and Richmond P. Hobson for a movie and an eveningout on the town. Hobson, who was living with his wife, Grizelda, at the HotelWeylin on Fifty-fourth Street, also had a residence in the nation’s capital.Tesla was seeing his friends on a daily basis at this time; Johnson wasparticularly lonely, even though he had children and grandchildren whofrequently came to visit. The following year, now an octogenarian, the old poetset off again for Europe. On this trip he was hoping to interview Madame MarieCurie.Although Tesla was able to spend much of the 1930s with Johnson, Hobson left thecity after only a short stay to purchase a cattle ranch with his son inVancouver. In April 1937, Tesla forwarded a new biography of his life that hadbeen translated from Serbo-Croatian into English to Johnson, who passed it on tothe editor in chief of the New York Times. At eighty-five years of age, Johnsonwas too weak to write a thank-you letter in his own hand, but he was able tosign it “R. U. Johnson—Luka Filipov.” Both Johnson and Hobson died shortlythereafter; the famous lieutenant, barely sixty years old, was buried inArlington Cemetery. With the help of Agnes Holden, Robert’s daughter, Tesla senta “gorgeous flowering azalea” to Grizelda, who appreciated greatly the kindthoughts of this dear friend.7Another character who stayed friendly with Tesla in the later years was GeorgeSylvester Viereck, wunderkind poet. Viereck was a sensualist, cynic, and Germanpropagandist during World War I and Nazi spokesman during the 1930s and WorldWar II. Tesla’s link to Viereck extended back thirty years, to when Gilder andJohnson introduced such provocative Viereck poems as “The Haunted House” in theCentury in 1906, which was a poem about an enchanting partner whose body was,alas, “a haunted place…When I did yield to passion’s swift demand,” Viereckpenned, “one of your lovers touched me with his hand. And in the pang of amorousdelight, I hear strange voices calling through the night.”8Viereck, who was probably an illegitimate grandson of Wilhelm II, abdicatedkaiser of Germany, was a multifaceted character and self-proclaimed genius.Having interviewed many of the greatest minds of the epoch, the German-Americanintellectual had rattled the souls of such individuals as Theodore Roosevelt,George Bernard Shaw, occultist Aleister Crowley, H. G. Wells, Sigmund Freud,Albert Einstein, Kaiser Wilhelm, and Adolf Hitler. A man in intimate contactwith his irrational side, Viereck had passed many a day with Sigmund Freud,explicating the great theoretician’s libido theory, influencing Freud’swritings, and applying the master’s psychology to modern life. Freud, Viereckwrote, was “motivated not only by a desire to complete his own world view, butby a belief that each individual represented a special expression of the worldspirit.”9Not an anti-Semite, having, for instance, cowritten a series of books with aJewish professor, Viereck, a lifelong German apologist, was nevertheless somehowable to rationalize the Nazi spiel, and he became an American spokesman forAdolf Hitler. Although Freud saw in this journalistic “lion hunter” a greatmind, he said that Viereck suffered from “narcissism, had delusions ofpersecution and a fixation on the Fatherland.” Once Viereck began to rationalizeHitler’s rhetoric, Freud saw the journalist as “debasing himself” and would notcorrespond with him anymore.10During one of a series of interviews Viereck conducted with Tesla, he revealedthat Tesla “was not a believer [in God] in the orthodox sense…To me, theuniverse is simply a great machine which never came into being and never willend. The human being is no exception to the natural order…What we call the‘soul’ or ‘spirit’ is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body.When this function ceases, the ‘soul’ or ‘spirit’ ceases likewise.” According toJohn O’Neill, this “meat machine” theory was really a ruse used to hide thenumerous mystical experiences that Tesla had.On his vision of the twenty-first century, Tesla foresaw a world in whicheugenics would be “universally established.” Perhaps spurred by Viereck’sdiscussion of the Aryan vision or the iniquitous American practice ofsterilizing criminals and some mentally retarded individuals, Tesla supportedthe idea of “sterilizing the unfit and deliberately guiding the mating instinct.A century from now,” the celibate concluded, “it will no more occur to a normalperson to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitualcriminal.”On diet, the slim epicurean revealed that he had given up meat altogether. Teslabelieved that in the future inexpensive and healthy food would be derived frommilk, honey, and wheat. As the 1930s progressed, the inventor would continue tolive on an ever-receding subsistence diet, moving from meat to fish tovegetables and finally to warm milk, bread, and something he called “factoractus.” Eliminating solid food altogether, the thinning wizard had concocted ahealth potion made up of a dozen vegetables, including white leeks, cabbagehearts, flower of cauliflower, white turnips, and lettuce hearts.11 Although hestill maintained that he might live to 140, a psychoanalytic view of thisregimen of meager victuals could only construe it as an anorexic, unconsciousplan for selfextinguishment.“Long before the next century dawns,” the oracle predicted, “systematicreforestation and the scientific management of natural resources will have madean end of all devastating droughts, forest fires and floods. Long distancetransmission of electrical power by harnessing waterfalls will dispense with thenecessity of burning fuel; robots and thinking machines will replace humans, andthe trend of spending more on war and less on education will be reversed.” Amajor reason for this would be Tesla’s latest discovery of his defensive shieldbetween nations.“If no country can be attacked successfully, there can be no purpose in war. Mydiscovery ends the menace of [war]. I do not say that there may not be severaldestructive wars before the world accepts my gift. I may not live to see itsacceptance.”12In the habit of meeting with Viereck and his family at their home on RiversideDrive on a somewhat regular basis, Tesla accepted an invitation to attend adinner party. Present was Viereck’s son Peter. Today, as a PulitzerPrize-winning poet and English professor, Peter remembers Tesla as almost anuncle.13 Also present was the youthful Elmer Gertz, who, at the time, waspreparing a biography of Viereck. A friend of Carl Sandburg and also biographerof voluptuary Frank Harris, Gertz would later come to defend such illustriousindividuals as Nathan Leopold (and Loeb), pornographic writer Henry Miller, andassassin Jack Ruby (in an appeal of the death sentence). At a spry eighty-fiveyears of age, Gertz remembered the meeting, which took place fifty-seven yearsbefore, when he was twenty-nine.“In a communicative mood, [at the dinner party] Tesla told his life storyunostentatiously, simply, with quiet eloquence. He told of his platonic affairsof the heart…explained the inventions that have made the world his debtor…[and]told of his plans, of his credo, of his foibles. It was a tale of wonders, toldwith guileless simplicity.”Struck by the fact that they were in “the same house that had seen Einstein,Sinclair Lewis, and countless others,” Gertz noted that “Viereck wascomparatively silent much of the night, but he was subtly responsible for theintellectual thrills of the evening.”14Pressed for other details, Gertz revealed that “Tesla knew all of Viereck’spoems by heart.” Tesla also discussed his platonic affair with Sarah Bernhardt,whom he had met while in Paris at the 1889 exposition. Differing with O’Neill’soft-quoted suggestion that Tesla avoided her eyes when he picked up herhandkerchief, Gertz said that Tesla had met with her on several occasions,perhaps also in New York. So taken with her was he that “Tesla had saved andpreserved her scarf without ever washing it” and still had it to that day.15Viereck provides a fascinating link between Tesla and Sigmund Freud: self-denialand eros. Stoilkovic told a story of how he was invited to Tesla’s New Yorkerapartment and a valet “brought in a bottle of wine in a dish of ice,” but Teslanever allowed it to be opened. When this event was replayed another evening,Tesla revealed that he kept the bottle there to prove that he could preventhimself from drinking it. A man of rigid habits, Tesla denied himself certainpleasures as a way to supposedly establish total control over himself. And yetTesla was a complete slave to his idiosyncrasies and to a cauldron of phobias.Going out of his way to avoid handshakes, displacing his amorous affections ontobirds, keeping hotel servants at a distance of at least three feet, throwing outcollars and gloves after one use, Tesla had other rigid requirements as well.The hotel was requested to keep one table permanently reserved for himself. Noone else was allowed to eat there. If a fly landed on the table, it had to bereset and a new plate of food brought forth. When it came to money matters,Tesla also showed little ability to restrain himself, and as we have seen, hehabitually refused to honor rent payments. From the Freudian point of view,Tesla was an anal-compulsive personality, fixated in the latent stage of sexualrepression, with a displacement of his energies into scientific endeavors. Bydenying his libido, his censor had converted his primal sexual energy into anodd mixture of prelogical behavior patterns that tended to diffuse, redirect,and sublimate the highly cathected complexes the inventor wished to deny. Itappears quite possible that Viereck strove to psychoanalyze Tesla, to have theinventor dig deep into his childhood in an effort to release submerged eventsthat may have blocked or redirected his life in neurotic fashion. Viereck, whowas known to partake of “opium tincture,” probably entered an altered state whenconversing with the ethereal prophet.16 Nearly eighty years old at the time,exceedingly frail and thin, Tesla wrote Viereck a long letter reviewing thetraumas of his childhood.> It was a dismal night with rain falling in torrents. My brother, a youth of> eighteen and intellectual giant, had died. My mother came to my room, took me> in her arms and whispered, almost inaudibly, “Come and kiss [Dane].” I pressed> my mouth against the ice cold lips of my brother knowing only that something> dreadful had happened. My mother put me again to bed and lingering a little> said with tears streaming, “God gave me one at midnight and at midnight took> away the other one.”17Viereck not only wanted Tesla to reactivate the hidden complexes associated withthe death of Dane but also to reflect on the very process of how his fertilemind gave birth to ideas. One can only guess as to whether or not Viereck trodinto the realm of Oedipus and Narcissus, dead-brother kissing rituals, andTesla’s monastic life of quirks, self-denial, and affection displaced ontofeathered friends.In 1937, on his eighty-first birthday, at a luncheon in his honor, Tesla was“bestowed” both the Order of the White Lion from the minister of Czechoslovakiaand the Grand Cordon of the White Eagle, the highest order of Yugoslavia, fromRegent Prince Paul by order of King Peter. Belgrade also set up an endowment of$600 per month, which they paid to him for the rest of his days. Looking muchlike an eagle himself, with his long, hawk-shaped proboscis accentuated by hisextreme leanness, the skeletal inventor “followed his annual custom [after theaward ceremony] by playing host to a group of newspaper men at his Hotel NewYorker suite.” There, dressed in his finest tuxedo, the wizard read a preparedtreatise outlining his latest inventions and plans for contacting nearbyplanets.18Just a few months later, in late autumn, while negotiating with emissaries fromthe war departments of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, England, the Soviet Union,and the United States, Tesla was run down by a taxicab. Refusing to see adoctor, the inventor managed to limp home. He stayed in bed on and off for sixmonths. He had cracked three ribs. Thus, in May 1938, still in the process ofrecuperation, he declined an invitation to attend another award ceremony at theNational Institute of Immigrant Welfare in honor of him, Felix Frankfurter, ofHarvard Law School, and Giovanni Martinelli, of the Metropolitan Opera.Accepting the award in Tesla’s honor was Dr. Paul Radosavljevich, professor ofpedagogy at New York University. Rado read a statement from Tesla whichapparently verified the famous 1885 Edison story that Edison had laughed off thepromised debt to Tesla of $50,000 for redesigning machinery.19In 1939, just as World War II was about to start, George Sylvester Viereck setoff on a surreptitious journey to the Fatherland. There, amid the pageantry ofswastikas and the Gestapo, he met yet again with Adolf Hitler and received acommuniqué signed by the Führer in his own hand. The date was February 26, 1939.Upon his return, Viereck continued his practice of preaching the Nazi line in avariety of publications, writing some articles under an assumed name,interpreting FDR as having a “messianic complex” and Hitler as “a dynamicgenius, and a poet of passion…first in war, first in peace, first in the heartsof his country-men.” Viereck was arrested and indicted on two counts ofseditious conspiracy. It was quickly established that he was on the Germanpayroll supposedly as a journalist but obviously as a paid propagandist.Conceited and selfdeluded, the bewildered and obtuse philosopher was sent tojail, where he wrote poetry for the next few years.20 Just as references toTesla were deleted from engineering texts, Viereck’s name was “dropped from manyanthologies, and Who’s Who.”21 Thus, both individuals disappeared from historybooks but for totally different reasons.As World War II began, Tesla was becoming more feeble, lapsing in and out ofstates of coherence. During one of his more lucid moments, he wrote (with thehelp of his nephew Sava Kosanovic) the foreword to Vice President HenryWallace’s address on “The Future of the Common Man” for the Serbo-Croatianedition. The essay not only portrays a prophet who envisions a better world inthe future; it also betrays the conflict and humiliation he himself suffered inhis dealings with the greedy industrialists who capitalized on his inventionswith little regard for his well-being, let alone the welfare of mankind as awhole: “Out of this war, the greatest since the beginning of history, a newworld must be born that would justify the sacrifices offered by humanity, wherethere will be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich; where theproducts of intellect, science and art will serve society for the betterment andbeautification of life, and not the individuals for achieving wealth. This newworld shall be a world of free men and free nations, equal in dignity andrespect.”22The old man gazed out the window as his nimble fingers unconsciously preened theruffled feathers of his beloved white pigeon with the brown-tipped wings.Although it was January, a lightning storm rumbled in the distance. “I’ve donebetter than that,” the wizard mumbled as the sun peeked through the clouds toreveal the iridescent purples, violets, greens, and reds of the neck feathers ofanother of the more hearty birds that came to visit. Tesla thought backaffectionately to his days as a boy on the farm, rolling down the hill carefreewith Mačak, his pet cat. And then his mind swirled with thoughts of violentarguments with Morgan, his unfinished fifteen-story transmission tower, and hisfriend Mark Twain, who was now in financial trouble. Requesting funds fromKosanovic, Tesla handed the money to a messenger to deliver to Twain, giving asthe address his old laboratory on South Fifth Avenue, a street that no longerexisted. Unable to locate the deceased writer, the boy returned to Tesla, buthis explanation was ignored. The old man told the boy to keep the money if hecould not deliver it.23Having neglected to pay the rent on his belongings held at Manhattan Storage,the wizard had managed somehow to mail out a check for $500 to a Serbian churchfund-raising event held in Gary, Indiana.24 G. J. Weilage, manager of ManhattanStorage, threatened to put the lot up for auction. The outstanding bill was$297. Perhaps too disillusioned to care, Tesla ignored the last warning, andWeilage made good on his promise, placing an announcement in the local papers.Noticing the advertisement, Jack O’Neill rushed to contact Tesla’s nephew SavaKasanovic, who was now the Yugoslavian ambassador stationed in New York.Kasanovic covered the debt and continued to make the carrying charge (fifteendollars per month), saving this invaluable legacy from tragic dismantlement.“One night,” Tesla wrote, “as I was lying in bed in the dark, solving problemsas usual, [my beloved pigeon] flew through the open window and stood on my desk.As I looked at her I knew she wanted to tell me—she was dying. And then, as Igot her message, there came a light from her eyes—powerful beams of light. Whenthat pigeon died, something went out of my life. I knew that my life’s work wasfinished.”25Lingering at the abyss throughout the beginning years of World War II, Teslacontinued to lead his dual life, meeting with friends and dignitaries wheneverpossible and lending out his secret papers to mysterious men. A few monthslater, he was dead. The date was January 7, 1943; he was eighty-six years old.> 2000 ARE PRESENT AT TESLA’S FUNERAL> > Great in Science Attend> > > > The President and I are deeply sorry to hear of the death of Mr. Nikola Tesla.> We are grateful for his contribution to science and industry and to this> country.> > Eleanor RooseveltThe funeral service was held in Serbian in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.With the coffin open, the Sermon for the Dead was conducted by the venerableReverend Dushan Shoukletovich, rector of the Serb Orthodox Church of St. Sava.Over the radio, New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a moving eulogy writtenby Croatian author Louis Adamić, as a long line of mourners filed past. The listof honorary pallbearers included Dr. Ernest Alexanderson of GE, who gained hiswealth and fame from inventing a powerful high-frequency transmitter; Dr. HarveyRentschler, director of the research laboratories of Westinghouse; EdwinArmstrong, father of FM radio; Consul General D. M. Stanoyevitch of Yugoslavia;William Barton, curator of the Hayden Planetarium, where Tesla often went tomeditate; and Gano Dunn, president of J. G. White Engineering and Tesla’sassistant a half century before, during his paradigm-shifting experimentsdelivered just a few blocks away at Columbia University.26“We cannot know, but it may be that a long time from now, when patterns arechanged, the critics will take a view of history,” Hugo Gernsback wrotepropitiously in his magazine. “They will bracket Tesla with Da Vinci, or withour own Mr. Franklin…One thing is sure,” Gernsback concluded. “The world, as werun it today, did not appreciate his peculiar greatness.”Col. David Sarnoff, president of RCA, also took the soapbox in Tesla’s behalf:“Nikola Tesla’s achievements in electrical science are monuments that symbolizeAmerica as a land of freedom and opportunity…His novel ideas of getting theether in vibration put him on the frontier of wireless. Tesla’s mind was a humandynamo that whirled to benefit mankind.”Edwin Armstrong, who was about to sue Sarnoff and RCA for infringing his FMpatents, helped place Tesla in the proper historical perspective when he said,“Who today can read a copy of The Inventions, Researches and Writings of NikolaTesla, published before the turn-of-the-century, without being fascinated by thebeauty of the experiments described and struck with admiration for Tesla’sextraordinary insight into the nature of the phenomena with which he wasdealing? Who now can realize the difficulties he must have had to overcome inthose early days? But one can imagine the inspirational effect of the book fortyyears ago on a boy about to decide to study the electrical art. Its effect wasboth profound and decisive.”27On September 25, 1943, just nine months after Tesla’s death, the BethlehemFairfield Shipyards near Baltimore launched the USS Nikola Tesla, aten-thousand-ton Liberty ship. Sponsors at the ceremony included a number ofCroats, such as Louis Adamić and violinist Zlatko Balokovic, and also Serbs,such as Tesla’s nephews Sava Kosonavic and Nicholas Trbojevich.28> The New York Sun editorialized:> > > > Mr. Tesla was eighty-six years old when he died.

Ralph E. Doty> Chief, Washington Branch1After Tesla’s death, the FBI, the Office of Alien Property (OAP), and factionsof the War Department conspired to impound and protect the Tesla secret-weaponrypapers. The United States was in the midst of a world war, and Tesla’s ties toarms merchants, Communists, through his Yugoslavian nephew, and a notoriousGerman propagandist all helped prompt the covert agencies to safeguard thismaterial until it was properly analyzed. A half century later, they have yet torelease it.Raised to the level of a national hero within the Slavic countries, Tesla wasconsidered practically of royal stock. Thus, his nephew, Sava Kosanovic, rose tobecome a representative of the newly forming Yugoslavia republic at the “EasternEuropean Planning Board,” which met in Czechoslovakia.2 Kosanovic, like Tesla,wanted a unified country, but their orientations were different.In 1941 the Nazis continued their policy of intimidation and deception by tryingto force a treaty with King Peter of Yugoslavia. Backed by the people, Peterrefused to agree to an alliance and therefore suffered a fatal blow when Germanymasterminded a brutal invasion involving troops from Bulgaria, Italy, andHungary and also three hundred Luftwaffe bombers.3Prof. Michael Markovitch of Long Island University, a Serb living in Croatiaduring World War II, has said that ninety thousand Serbs were killed by theCroats; and when I inquired why, he said, “Because the Croats were fascists,”that is, because they had aligned themselves with the Nazis. As a youth in themidst of the war, Markovitch had watched the bodies float down the river. Whenasked why he survived, his reply was “sheer luck.”Concerning the Tesla mythology, Markovitch said that ever since he was a child,he was aware that Tesla was considered a great national hero. Years later, asHitler’s invasion became imminent, Markovitch and his countrymen had expectedTesla himself to return to Belgrade and shield it from the Nazis by harnessinghis impenetrable death shield! Unfortunately, Tesla never came.4Kosanovic was not as romantic a figure, and although a Serb, he abandoned theexiled king in order to back the rising Croat leader, Joseph Tito (Josip Broz),and his Communist doctrine. Tito was a solid choice; although he was an ally ofthe Soviets, he was able to maintain autonomy. He also sought to unify thewarring factions; his marriage to a Serbian woman was a powerful symbol inadvancing this goal.5Since the Soviet Union was an ally, Kosanovic, as a Yugoslavian ambassador, wasable to travel freely to America to discuss various diplomatic tactics with thenew leadership. Thus, during the course of World War II, he was able to attendto his ailing uncle in New York and also try to finalize plans to set up amuseum in Belgrade in order to honor the great inventor.In 1942, Tesla became more seriously ill and suffered from palpitations andfainting spells. Although Tesla’s true commitment was to the young exiled kingPeter, Tesla’s nephew was able to coax the inventor into sending a message toTito which preached unification between Serbs and Croats. Kosanovic alsoadmitted shielding Tesla from factions of the Serbian royalty at the same time;however, when Peter arrived in New York City, he actively helped arrange ameeting between Tesla and the king.Having unsuccessfully talked with Churchill in England and Roosevelt inWashington, both of whom were reluctantly backing Tito, King Peter was at leastconsoled by Eleanor Roosevelt, who attended a large party in his honor at theColony Club in New York. Organized by the American Friends of Yugoslavia, theking’s mother, Queen Marie, and also Anne Morgan, Pierpont’s daughter, attended,but Tesla was too ill to come.Therefore, King Peter (with Kosanovic) took a cab to the Hotel New Yorker toconfer with the virtual patriarch of his country. Shocked by Tesla’s cadaverouscondition and upset by the terrible chain of events in his country, Peter toldthe inventor that he had hoped that he could have returned to Yugoslavia to freeit from the Nazis. In his diaries, Peter also revealed that he and Tesla wepttogether “for all the sorrows that had torn apart [their] homeland.”6A few months later, Tesla was dead. A maid discovered his body on January 8,1943. While Hugo Gernsback rushed to make a death mask, Kenneth Swezey, SavaKosanovic, and George Clark, director of a museum and laboratory at RCA, enteredthe apartment. With a locksmith and the hotel management present, they removedvarious documents from the inventor’s safe. Although the FBI alleged that“valuable papers, electrical formulas, designs, etc., were taken,” the hotelmanagement confirmed that Kosanovic removed only three pictures and Swezey tookthe 1931 testimonial autograph book created for the commemoration of Tesla’sseventy-fifth birthday.These events were monitored by the ubiquitous surveillance mastermind J. EdgarHoover, hard-line anti-Communist and protector of American interests. Hooverwrote in a memorandum under the heading “Espionage,” that he feared thatKosanovic, as heir to the Tesla estate, “might make certain material availableto the enemy.” Kosanovic had been identified as a member of the Eastern EuropeanPlanning Board, but because of the complicated condition of the Balkan states,there was essentially no way for Hoover to ascertain exactly where Kosanovic’salliances rested. He could have been affiliated with King Peter, the CommunistTito, Fascist factions associated with Mussolini, Hitler, the Soviet Union, ornone of the above.7Consistent with his suspicious nature, Hoover also questioned Tesla’ssympathies, even though the inventor was friends with Vice President HenryWallace and Franklin Roosevelt through letters to his wife, Eleanor. One of themain reasons for Hoover’s concerns was Tesla’s address before the Friends ofSoviet Russia which he gave at the Grange Hall in Springfield, Massachusetts, in1922.8On January 8, Abraham N. Spanel, the forty-two-year-old president of theInternational Latex Corporation of Dover, Delaware (now Playtex), who wasresiding in New York City, had called FBI agent Fredrich Cornels to discussTesla’s death-ray experiments. As the inventor had just died, Spanel feared thatKosanovic would obtain the pertinent papers and pass them to the Soviets.Spanel had already begun to make a name for himself in media and militarycircles by having invented floating pontoon stretchers for soldiers wounded inamphibious landings and by turning back the million-dollar profits to thegovernment for the war effort. Born in Odessa in 1901, Spanel would later becamea vociferous anti-Communist who spent upward of $8 million throughout the 1940sand 1950s “buying space in the United States press to reprint articles thatwould contribute to an understanding of world problems.” Having fled to Francein 1905 to escape the anti-Semitic pogroms of Russia with his family as a child,Spanel, at the age of seven, came to the United States in 1908. A graduate ofthe University of Rochester, Spanel had invented electrical appliances andpneumatic products in the early 1920s before starting the International LatexCorporation in 1929.9 Realizing the potential importance of the Tesla inventionin the “democratic” fight for world supremacy, Spanel had contacted Dr. D.Lozado, adviser to Vice President Wallace, and a Mr. Bopkin of the Department ofJustice. Bopkin agreed to contact J. Edgar Hoover regarding the affair, andLozado conferred with Wallace and perhaps even FDR, calling Spanel back shortlyafter their conversation to convey that the government was “vitally interestedin Tesla’s papers.”10Spanel had also contacted one Bloyce Fitzgerald, whom the FBI had pegged as “anelectrical engineer who was a protégé of Tesla’s,” who had also called Cornels.Having met Fitzgerald at an engineering meeting a few years earlier, Spanelbecame highly interested in the Tesla weapon, possibly hoping to become involvedin a profitable business developing the death-beam device for the U.S. military.Fitzgerald, still in his twenties, had been in postal communication with Teslasince the late 1930s. He had called the inventor on his birthday in 1938 tocongratulate him and continued this practice for the next four years. In 1939,Fitzgerald tried to meet Tesla, but it appears that he did not do so at thattime. Just two weeks prior to Tesla’s death, Fitzgerald proposed anothermeeting; it may have taken place. He was working at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology with Professors Keenan, Woodruff, and Kay “in the solution ofcertain problems regarding the dissipation of energy from rapid fire weapons”and desired to discuss his “radiation problem” with the elderly inventor.11It is plausible that at this delicate time Fitzgerald was able to borrow thevarious papers in which he was interested. Coincidentally, Tesla had declaredthat “efforts had been made to steal the invention. [My] room had been enteredand [my] papers examined, but the…spies left empty handed.”12 Fitzgerald, whoalso worked for the Ordinance Department of the U.S. Army, later told Cornelsthat he “knows [that] the complete plans, specifications and explanations of thebasic theories of these things are some place in the personal effects ofTesla…[and] that there is a working model [of the death ray]…which cost morethan $10,000 to build in a safety deposit box of Tesla’s at the Governor ClintonHotel.”13To corroborate this story, another acquaintance of Tesla’s, Charles Hausler, ahired hand who took care of the inventor’s pigeons, later said that Tesla “had alarge box or container in his room near the pigeon cages. He told me to be verycareful not to disturb the box as it contained something that could destroy anairplane in the sky and he had hopes for presenting it to the world.” Hausleralso added that the device was later stored in the basement of a hotel.14Fitzgerald reported that Tesla had claimed that he had eighty trunks indifferent locations in the city containing inventions, manuscripts, and plans ofhis various work. The young engineer reiterated the need for the government toobtain the Tesla papers “for use in war.” He was also worried about the “loyaltyand patriotism to the Allied Nations” of Sava Kosanovic and another nephew,Nicholas Trbojevich.During these same days, Cornels’s overseer, D. E. Foxworth, an assistantdirector of the FBI, assured those concerned that “this matter would be properlyhandled,” that Tesla’s “nephew, who is his heir,” would not be able to send thepapers to “the Axis Powers.”15 On the eleventh, yet another FBI agent, T. J.Donegan, brought up the possibility that the New York district attorney couldhave Kosanovic and Swezey picked up “discretely on a burglary charge.” However,this was not done. Three days later, Donegan notified Hoover that the situation“was being handled as an enemy custodian matter and therefore we should take nofurther action.”16OFFICE OF ALIEN PROPERTYWhat happened appears to be this: The FBI attempted to remove themselves fromthe responsibility in the Tesla case, thereby allowing the OAP to take charge.Nevertheless, because of the FBI’s initial involvement, numerous peoplecontacted them through the years in attempts to gain access to the Tesla estate.The OAP questioned the legality of their own jurisdiction, since Tesla was anaturalized citizen. However, as Kosanovic was probably legally entitled to hisuncle’s estate, the OAP had justification in considering the material alienproperty. According to Irving Jurow, who was the attorney assigned to the Teslacase at the time of his death, “the activities of the OAP were not only not‘illegal,’ it was the only government agency with statutory power to seize‘enemy assets’ without court order.”17 Because of this unique jurisdiction, itwas the OAP and only the OAP that maintained legal control over the papers untilthey were released ten years later. Naturally, both real and imagined concernsinvolving the war situation were the key factors influencing what to theuninformed appeared to be an illegal action. The Germans still controlled alarge part of Europe, and the outcome of the war was by no means determined inJanuary 1943. Rumors that the enemy was also developing an ultimate weapon werealso well founded.18Walter Gorsuch, alien property custodian, thereupon ordered all of Tesla’sbelongings, including the safe from his apartment and other holdings in thebasement of the New Yorker, shipped to where Tesla’s other possessions were,Manhattan Storage. Gorsuch, however, was out of the office the day Tesla’s bodywas discovered, and it was the young attorney Irving Jurow who handled the case.“At about noon, on Saturday, January 9th,” Jurow recalled, fifty years later, “Iwas ordered by telephone from the Washington office not to close up shop, but towait for further instructions. I was informed that a Nikola Tesla had just died,that he was reputed to have invented, and in the possession of a ‘death ray,’ asignificant military device capable of destroying incoming war planes[presumably Japanese on the West Coast] by ‘projecting’ a beam into the skiesand creating a ‘field of energy’ which would cause the planes to ‘disintegrate.’Moreover, it was suspected that German [enemy] agents were in ‘hot pursuit’ tolocate the device or the plans for its production.”With orders to impound all of Tesla’s belongings, Jurow was also instructed to“visit other hotels where Tesla had resided and to take similar action.” Jurowwas accompanied by four individuals from the Office of Naval Intelligence, armyintelligence, and the FBI. Arriving at the Hotel New Yorker, “We learned thatTesla had been found dead by the service maid. We were told that he was laid outin his bed…with only a pair of stockings on.” The officials were also told thatKosanovic had been in the room and had removed three photographs.The military officers were “concerned about the death ray model, but I was theonly one who had authority.” Taking a taxi, Jurow and the others visited each ofthe hotels, which included the St. Regis, the Waldorf-Astoria, and the GovernorClinton, and they also visited Manhattan Storage. Tesla’s possessions wereimpounded there, and the safe-deposit box at the Governor Clinton was alsoimpounded.With Walter Gorsuch, Jurow went to visit Ambassador Kosanovic at his hotel onCentral Park South, where they apparently also met Nikola Trbojevich, Tesla’sother nephew, and an elderly lady who did not speak English. Gorsuch and Jurowsaw the photos on a table and left. “I was told later,” Jurow recalled,“probably through the staff of the OAP, that Tesla’s trunks contained mostlynewspapers and bird seed, and that the safe deposit box contained a model ofsome type of device, whether the ‘death ray’ or not, is not clear. It was alsorumored that the Soviet Union had offered Tesla $50 million to come to the USSRand work on his ‘death ray’ but he refused.”As Jurow had never heard of Tesla before January 8, 1943, he saw the inventor asa “deadbeat” because he did not pay his hotel bills. “He may have been‘disturbed’ because he spent so much time feeding pigeons,” Jurow said. But thestory was too strange and too incomplete for him, so he called the Westinghousepeople to try to verify who Tesla was. “They were ecstatic,” Jurow recalled.“They said that without Tesla there would have been no Westinghouse.”19The Manhattan Storage inventory did not mention the birdseed, which played soprominently in Jurow’s memory. Possessions listed included “12 locked metalboxes, 1 steel cabinet, 35 metal cans, 5 barrels and 8 trunks.” Gorsuch alsoordered the “large hotel box at the Hotel Governor Clinton held for over 10years as security for unpaid bills sealed.”20 Jack O’Neill’s papers were alsoconfiscated,21 although they were probably returned to him, for he was able topublish his extensive biography a year later.Although Kosanovic assured O’Neill that “there was no reason to worry” and thatthe OAP “conveyed full rights” to the Tesla papers to him; in fact, Kosanovicwas highly concerned. He hired Philip Wittenberg, from Wittenberg, Carrington &Farnsworth, to protect his interest. Although the lawyer pleaded the case, thegovernment countered with advice from the War Policies Unit of the Department ofJustice. They ruled that Kosanovic could not touch the estate. This edict wasmaintained throughout the 1940s. Tesla’s secret weaponry papers were scrutinizedby various divisions of the military, although the nephew was given thecombination to the safe and took care of the fifteen dollars-per-month rent forthe storage of the property during the entire period.Within a week of Tesla’s death, Walter Gorsuch met with his Washingtonrepresentative, Joseph King, and together with H. B. Ritchen of the AntitrustDivision of the Department of Justice, they called in Colonel Parrott ofMilitary Intelligence and “Bloyce Fitzgerald of the U.S. Army,” whom theyconsidered “a former employee of Tesla’s.” One key problem discussed was thatTesla was “supposed to have been working for, and in the pay of the Yugoslavgovernment-in-exile.” Fitzgerald also discussed the supposed Tesla model held ina vault at the Governor Clinton Hotel.22It was determined that before Tesla’s estate could be released to Kosanovic, athorough probe of its contents should be undertaken. Prof. John O. Trump,director and founder of MIT’s High Voltage Research Laboratory and secretary ofthe Microwave Committee at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) of theOffice of Scientific Research and Development, was commissioned to go to thewarehouse and conduct the investigation of the contents of the eighty-eight-oddtrunks. They were held in rooms 5J and 5L. Trump set aside two days for thetask. He was aided in the search by an inventory of the Tesla holdings compiledby Mr. O’Sullivan, one of the guards at Manhattan Storage.Trump was accompanied by five individuals: two members of the OAP—John Newinton,from the New York office, and Charles Hedetneimi, chief investigator fromWashington—and three from Naval Intelligence—Willis George, a civilian agent;John Corbett, who served as stenographer; and Edward Palmer, who tookphotographs and probably microfilm copies. Both Corbett and Palmer were alsolisted as chief yeomen of the U.S. Marine Reserves.23As the only qualified scientist able to comprehend the work, Trump spent littlemore than half this time actually perusing the wizard’s cache. “The second daywas somewhat cursory in character,” Hedetneimi reported reluctantly, “since Dr.Trump was confident that nothing valuable would be found. He was entirelyconvinced that it would be useless to look in the 29-odd trunks which…had…beenstored since 1933.”24The Trump papers, which included a synopsis of about one dozen articles by orabout Tesla, began with an opening letter. The professor acknowledged that heand his colleagues investigated the Tesla trunks at Manhattan Storage on January26 and 27, summarizing first that (1) “no investigation of the Tesla trunks heldfor 10 years in the basement of the Hotel New Yorker was conducted”; (2) “noscientific notes, descriptions of hitherto unrevealed methods or devices oractual apparatus…of scientific value to this country or which would constitute ahazard in unfriendly hands [was found]…I can therefore see no technical ormilitary reason why further custody of the property should be retained.”Nevertheless, Trump “removed…a file of various written materials which coverstypically and fairly completely the ideas which he [Tesla] was concerned [with]during the later years” and forwarded it or copies of it to Mr. Gorsuch of theOAP.Trump concluded in his report that the last fifteen years of Tesla’s life were“primarily of a speculative, philosophical and somewhat promotional character.”On his return to Washington, Trump met with Homer Jones, chief of the Divisionof Investigation and Research. “Sir,” the MIT professor smugly concluded, “uponthe basis of my examination, it is my opinion that the Tesla papers containnothing of value for the war effort, and nothing which would be helpful to theenemy if it fell into enemy hands.”“Are you quite certain in this conclusion, Dr. Trump?”“I am willing to stake my professional reputation on it.”25Satisfied, Jones sent the report and Trump’s recommendations to Lawrence M. C.Smith, chief, Special War Policies Unit of the War Division of the Department ofJustice, and that, for one faction of the government, ended the matter.26Trump drew up a report which described a number of articles by the inventor,interviews, and scientific treatises. Exhibits D, F, and Q refer to a highlytechnical and heretofore underground Tesla treatise written in 1937 entitled TheNew Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the NaturalMedia. This article, in contradiction to Trump’s statement, contained explicitinformation which had never been published describing the actual workings of aparticle-beam weapon for destroying tanks and planes and for ignitingexplosives. Novel features included (1) an open-ended vacuum tube sealed with agas jet “while at the same time, permitting and facilitating the exit of theparticles”; (2) a way to generate many millions of volts for charging minuteparticles; (3) a method of creating and directing a non-dispersive stream ofsuch particles with a trajectory of many miles.Written virtually as a patent application, the Tesla article presents in clearand straightforward terms the mathematical equations and schematics of his deathray. Aside from the unpublished drawing and mathematical analysis of itscapability, it employed three most unusual features. The first was its mechanismfor creating a non-dispersive beam of particles. “I perfected means forincreasing enormously the intensity of the effects, but was baffled in all myefforts to materially reduce dispersion and became fully convinced that thishandicap could only be overcome by conveying the power through the medium ofsmall particles projected, at prodigious velocity, from the transmitter.Electrostatic repulsion was the only means to this end…Since the cross sectionof the carriers might be reduced to almost microscopic dimensions, an immenseconcentration of energy, irrespective of distance, could be attained.”The second feature involved the creation of an open-ended vacuum tube byreplacing the walled enclosure or glass window with a “gaseous jet of highvelocity”; and the third outstanding feature was the means for generating largevoltages. Having studied the precursors in the Van de Graaff electrostaticgenerator (a device which Tesla said was all but useless for generating usableamounts of energy), Tesla replaced the circulating cardboard belt thattransferred the charge with an ionized stream of air hermetically sealed in a220-foot-long circular vacuum chamber. Analogous to the way a shock can becreated and transferred by rubbing one’s shoes along a carpet on a dry day, thenew fluid airstream belt achieved the same end but to a degree “many timesgreater than a belt generator.” This charge, which apparently could be as muchas 60 million volts, was in turn transferred to the myriad small bulbs at thetop of the tower, their round shape and internal structure constructed toaugment the accumulation of energy.Atop this domed citadel, which was planned to be over a hundred feet in height,was the particle-beam weapon. Nestled in a turret as a supergun, the weapon wasset up so that tungsten wire could be fed into its highvacuum firing chamber.There minute “droplets” of this metal would be sheared off and repelled out thelong barrel at velocities exceeding 400,000 feet per second.27 The entireapparatus apparently was also constructed for nonmilitary purposes, such as fortransmitting streams of electrical energy to distant places, much like microwavewireless telephone trunk lines do today.Although Trump downplayed the importance of this paper, it is, to the presentday, classified top secret by the U.S. military, with copies at the time goingto naval intelligence, the FBI, the OAP, the NDRC, Wright-Patterson Air ForceBase, MIT, and most likely, the White House.AMTORG TRADING CORPORATIONExhibits D, F, and Q state explicitly that Tesla sold the plans for theconstruction of his particle-beam weapon to A. Bartanian, a Soviet agent of theAmtorg Trading Corporation! These exhibits also specify that Tesla offered thedevice to the U.S. military, Great Britain, and Yugoslavia.28Surprisingly, the FBI did not exploit this blatant Soviet connection, eventhough this was just the kind of thing that J. Edgar Hoover thrived on. Onepossible reason was that the Soviet Union was an ally at that time. Furthermore,a number of major corporations, such as Bethlehem Steel, RCA, and Westinghouse,were selling equipment to the Soviets via Amtorg, a company that did over abillion dollars of business in America by the time of World War II. FDR, forinstance, in 1933, approved $4 million in credit to Amtorg to purchase cottonfrom American suppliers. Amtorg, in return, supplied the country with furs,caviar, oil, and precious metals. Still operating in America today, Amtorg wasunable “to find any mention of Mr. Tesla [in their] records.”29If Tesla really did receive $25,000 from Amtorg in 1935, which the communiquéwith the Soviets implied, why wouldn’t he have paid off his debts to the HotelsPennsylvania and Governor Clinton and retrieved his secret device held ascollateral? An amount as large as $25,000 at the height of the Great Depressionwas worth roughly twenty times that figure today, yet there is no indicationthat Tesla obtained great wealth during that period, although he may havereceived this amount and used it to pay off other debts and purchase otherequipment.A few days after viewing the estate, Trump went to the Governor Clinton to viewthe actual death ray held in their vault. Charles Hedetneimi of the OAP,reported that “officers of the hotel showed us the handwritten letter in whichTesla stated that he was leaving the equipment as security and that it was worth$10,000.” Trump later recalled the incident: “Tesla had warned the managementthat this “device” was a secret weapon, and it would detonate if opened by anunauthorized person. Upon opening the vault…the hotel manager and employeespromptly left the scene.”The Trump letter went on to describe his reluctance to remove the brown papercovering and that before summoning his courage, he looked outside and noticedthat the day was pleasant. “Inside was a handsome wooden chest bound withbrass…[containing] a multidecade resistance box of the type used for aWheatstone bridge resistance measurements—a common standard item found in everyelectric laboratory before the turn of the century!”30“At this point,” Hedetneimi concluded, “Dr. Trump indicated that he had nofurther interest in the case.”An FBI report written just two weeks prior to Trump’s visit to the hoteldescribed the managers’ assessment of the inventor somewhat differently, and itdoes not appear that they took him as seriously as Trump alleges. “The Hotelmanagers report he [Tesla] was very eccentric, if not mentally deranged duringthe past ten years and it is doubtful if he has created anything of value duringthat time, although prior to that he probably was a very brilliant inventor.”31DID TESLA ACTUALLY BUILD A PROTOTYPE OF THEDEATH RAY?The inventor appears to have told both Hausler, his pigeon caretaker, andFitzgerald, the army engineer, that he did build a working model; and in aninterview I had with Mrs. Czito, whose husband’s father and grandfather wereboth trusted Tesla employees, she recalls that her father-in-law used to recountstories of Tesla bouncing electronic beams off the moon. This is not a deathray, but it certainly supports the hypothesis that the inventor created workingmodels along these lines.The well-known columnist Joseph Alsop, who interviewed Tesla at the Hotel NewYorker and who was one of the first to fully report Tesla’s work withparticle-beam weapons, described an experience Tesla had when experimenting withcathode-ray tubes, “Sometimes a particle larger than an electron, but still verytiny, would break off from the cathode, pass out of the tube and hit him. Hesaid he could feel a sharp, stinging pain where it entered his body, and againat the place where it passed out. The particles in the beam of force, [i.e.,the] ammunition…will travel far faster.”32Other evidence has been reported by Corum and Corum, who assert that thisinvention was an outcropping of Tesla’s work on X-ray machines patented in themid-1890s. Thus, we can trace the Tesla death ray to at least three earlierinventions, his Tesla coil and work in high-frequency currents from the early1890s, his work in bombarding targets with Roentgen rays in 1896, and also his1901 ideas associated with transmitting energy by means of wireless by beamingup an ionizing ray from his magnifying transmitter and using it is a conduit toreach the ionosphere. With this mechanism, Tesla planned not only to circle theglobe with information but also to illuminate shipping lanes over the oceans andcontrol the weather.The deBobula schematic, the Corums write, having studied the plans in Belgrade,was also taken to Alcoa Aluminum, which said that it was ready to supply thematerials as soon as Tesla raised the necessary capital.33 Alcoa, however, wasunable to locate any reference to Tesla in their corporate records.34At the age of eighty-one, Tesla stated at a luncheon attended by ministers ofYugoslavia and Czechoslovakia that he had constructed a number ofbeam-transmission devices, including the death ray, for protecting a countryfrom incoming invasions and a laserlike machine that could send impulses to themoon and other planets (in Exhibit I). He also said that he was going to takethe death ray to a Geneva conference for world peace. When pressed by thecolumnists to “give a full description…Dr. Tesla said, ‘But it is not anexperiment…I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will passbefore I can give it to the world.”35Considering that Tesla had two secret laboratories throughout the 1930s in whichno reporter ever set foot,36 we are left with a mystery. Did Tesla really “scam”the hotel by frightening the management into accepting a bogus invention in lieuof $400 rent? Feeling that the world owed him a place in which to live, perhapshe purposely chose not to pay for his housing. This certainly was a compulsiveand self-destructive pattern during the latter quarter of his life. Lessermortals often fore the brunt of his repressed rage. He was known to be abrasiveto maids and office secretaries. Having made it a habit to live on credit, Teslamay have derived great pleasure during those lugubrious nights when he wasforced to face his failures in thinking back to the chaps at the Hotel GovernorClinton trembling at the terrible weapon they kept protected in their midst.THE CONSPIRACY SCENARIOSecret agents break into Tesla’s New Yorker Hotel safe without Kasanovicknowing, remove keys to his Hotel Governor Clinton vault, and steal thedeath-ray prototype, substituting the equipment Trump found a week or two later.This potential incident would have had to have taken place between January 9 andJanuary 29, 1943, the dates of Tesla’s death, and the end of Trump’sinvestigations. The agents who performed this task, if it occurred, could havebeen Bloyce Fitzgerald and Ralph E. Doty. The evidence is as follows:Sava Kosavonic’s secretary at this time was Charlotte Muzar. She reports thatshe saw Tesla during his last days for the purpose of delivering funds that herequired and that she was also present at the opening of the safe after Tesladied. Present were Kenneth Swezey, Sava Kosanovic, and George Clark. Accordingto her story and official reports, a locksmith was called in to change thecombination of the safe and give the new combination to Kosanovic, who was theonly one who had it. In the safe, before he locked it again, was a set of keysand the 1917 Edison Medal. About ten years later, when the estate was finallyshipped to Belgrade and the safe opened, the Edison Medal and the keys werefound to be missing. The medal was never recovered, but the keys were foundoutside the safe “in one of the numerous cases of documents.”37A January 12, 1943, OAP memorandum states that Charles McNamara, assistantmanager of the Hotel Governor Clinton, “permitted [the OAP] to seal safetydeposit box #103, which contained the $10,000 machine…Box #103 is not aspecially constructed box as Fitzgerald said. It is, however, one of the largestboxes of the lower tiers.” The day before this, at the Hotel New Yorker, Tesla’sbedside safe was opened. Present, according to another OAP memorandum, asidefrom Swezey, Clark, and Kosanovic, were two hotel personnel from the New Yorker,Mr. L. O. Doty, credit manager, and Mr. L. A. Fitzgerald, assistant creditmanager.It strikes this researcher as a rather odd coincidence that these twoindividuals carried the same last names as a colonel from military intelligenceand the ever-present Bloyce Fitzgerald.If, in fact, these two supposed credit managers were really government agents,it would have been a fairly easy task for them to retrieve the key (or make acopy) to box no. 103 and swap the device.A further investigation of the FBI files reveals that on October 17, 1945, E. E.Conroy from the New York office, sent two copies of the Trump report to J. EdgarHoover and reviewed with him, once again, the roles played by Fitzgerald,Spanel, a censored person “X” and Kosanovic. Conroy said that “X” (probablyanother FBI agent) suspected that Spanel was “definitely pro-Russian inattitude” and that Spanel was spreading pro-Communist propaganda in full-pageads in various newspapers and yet also suing these newspapers for libel. Conroyalso reiterated that Spanel had ties to Vice President Henry Wallace, so cautionwas advised.It appears that Spanel had met Fitzgerald (a friend of “X”) at an engineeringmeeting in November 1942. Fitzgerald at the time was an army private at WrightField, Dayton, Ohio. He was described in the FBI report as “a brilliant20-year-old scientist who spent endless hours with Tesla before hisdeath…Fitzgerald had developed some sort of anti-tank gun.” Spanel tried to forma partnership with Fitzgerald in order to sell this weapon to the Remington ArmsCompany, but for some reason “Spanel blocked the final sale” and then tried toarrange a more lucrative deal with Eiogens Ship Building Company of New Orleans.In November 1943, Eiogens fired Fitzgerald, and a year later the young engineerreturned to the army. “Today, [1945, Fitzgerald is]…engaged in a highly secretexperimental project at Wright Field…In spite of his rank of private, Fitzgeraldis actually director of this research and is working with many top youngscientists…on perfection of Tesla’s ‘death ray’ which in Fitzgerald’s opinion isthe only defense against offensive use by another nation of the atom bomb.”38Conroy suggested cooperating with Fitzgerald in order to secure “legalpossession of Tesla’s effects.” The goal, of course, was to obtain and protectthe details of the weapons system, yet also to set up a “memorial foundation…forthe preservation of the inventor’s memory.” Fitzgerald purportedly alsointerested Henry Ford in the project.On October 19, 1945, Brig. Gen. L. C. Craigee, Chief Engineering DivisionControl Equipment Branch, Wright Field, writing at the request of BloyceFitzgerald, David Pratt, Herbert Schutt, and P. E. Houle, all engineers workingat Wright Field, contacted Harvey Ross of the FBI in New York in order toofficially “request…in the interest of National Defense, access…to the effectsof Dr. Nicola Tesla held in Manhattan Storage Warehouse.” Col. Ralph Doty, frommilitary intelligence in Washington, followed up the inquiry by working as aliaison officer between the War Department, the OAP, and the FBI.39Since the FBI had no jurisdiction over the Tesla estate, Fitzgerald, Conroy, andCraigee were referred to the OAP.On September 5, 1945, Lloyd Shaulis, of the OAP, mailed off two copies of theTrump report to Colonel Holliday of the Equipment Laboratory, Propulsions andAccessories Subdivision, who no doubt forwarded them to Fitzgerald. “These werethe full photostatic copies, not merely the abstracts.”40 Two years later,Colonel Duffy of Air Material Command, Wright Field, wrote to the OAP that thepapers were still being evaluated.By 1950, Kosanovic was still barred from the warehouse.41 He was now officiallythe Yugoslavian ambassador to both the United States and the United Nations, andhis patience had reached its limit. Kosanovic wanted his uncle’s effects inBelgrade, where they would be rightly honored. In March he went to the warehouseto inform them of the inventor’s wishes to send the estate to the Tesla Museum.It was at this time that the ambassador was informed that the FBI hadmicrofilmed the entire contents. He called J. Edgar Hoover to request a copy ofthe microfilm, but Hoover said that they did not have such a copy. Kosanovic hadprobably been misinformed; one of the warehouse people may have mistaken theTrump people for the FBI; or another group microfilmed the papers (now held inthe Library of Congress) at a different time.Finally, in 1952, arrangements were made, and the entire eighty trunks wereshipped to Belgrade. Included were many valuable original papers completelyunknown to O’Neill, such as Tesla’s 1899 Colorado diary, various photographs,tens of thousands of letters, and most of his inventions, including theremote-controlled boat, wireless fluorescent lamp, motors, turbines, plans forhis vertical takeoff flivver plane, and a model of the magnifying transmitter.Tesla’s ashes were sent at a later date.Spanel would be questioned by Joseph MaCarthy, and the copies of the death raypapers moved further underground.THE PROBABLE TRAIL OF THE SECRET PAPERIn 1984, Andrija Puharich presented Tesla’s secret death-ray paper to theInternational Tesla Centennial Symposium, held in Colorado Springs. It waspublished in the proceedings. Puharich told this author that the original sourceof the report was Ralph Bergstresser, author of a notable Tesla articlepublished in 1957. Puharich thought that Bergstresser, along with an associate(who may have been Bloyce Fitzgerald), was linked to the FBI and thus obtainedthe paper in that capacity. In the 1940s, Bergstresser worked for RCA and“Marconi’s boys. I always believed that Marconi was the inventor of thewireless…Then I found out it was all a lie.” Bergstresser, who was about eightyyears old when I spoke to him, recalled that Marconi had lived on a ship on thehigh seas to avoid subpoenas Tesla tried to give him.At the outbreak of World War II, Bergstresser began to work on “behalf of thewar effort…[when] he [Tesla] turned over to me [his various papers]. I wouldtake and read them and return them to him.” According to one source,Bergstresser was under the command of the new secret organization the Office ofStrategic Services (OSS), (later the Central Intelligence Agency [CIA]), and inthat capacity he was analyzing the papers for their military significance.Bergstresser recounted that he had only known Tesla during the last six monthsof his life. “He was skinny, tall, stooped, emaciated—didn’t eat right.” Infurther questioning, he also said that he had known Jack O’Neill and hiscolleague William Lawrence, author of the 1940 New York Times death-ray article,which sparked such interest by the FBI and factions of the armed forces, andthat he and Bergstresser had attended Tesla’s funeral together in 1943.During the conversation, I asked Bergstresser if he had any proof to support hiscontention that Tesla’s papers had been systematically removed from libraries.He said that the conspiracy was massive and extremely complex, going back to J.Pierpont Morgan and his wish to suppress Tesla’s wireless power distributioninventions because they threatened to provide cheap or free power for themasses. He was upset that Tesla’s entire estate was “hauled away…behind the IronCurtain” and partially blamed Lawrence, who he said was later found to be aCommunist. He agreed that Bloyce Fitzgerald had probably taken the papers toWright-Patterson Air Force Base, but he declined to comment on any relationshipto Fitzgerald or the trail of the secret papers.Puharich had said that the particle beam article had been passed fromBergstresser to Bob Beck of the U.S. Psychotronics Society around 1981 and fromthere they were passed to him.42INFLUENCE OF THE MCCARTHY PERIODIt was true that by the time the FBI and federal government became activelyinvolved in suppressing Tesla’s scientific papers, the inventor had alreadyslipped from the mass consciousness. Nevertheless, an air of secrecy, supportedby the taint of ties to a German fifth column or the Communists via his Yugoslavheritage, served to submerge even further the inventor’s work. This wasaugmented by the transfer of Tesla’s papers to the remote city of Belgrade.STAR WARSTesla’s numerous inventions could be applied in a variety of ways for militarypurposes, for example, particle-beam weapons, worldwide radar, earthquakecontrivances, brain-wave manipulation. One or more magnifying transmitters couldsupposedly send destructive impulses through the earth to any location. Thus, awell-placed jolt of many millions of volts could theoretically destroy thecommunications network of any major city. Recent discourses on potential futurewarfare technologies stemming mainly from war games analyst Lt. Col. Tom Beardenand parapsychologist Andrija Puharich, M.D., suggest that the Soviets hadharnessed various Tesla weapons, including apparatus for seismic, weather, andmind control.43According to Bearden, the Tesla magnifying transmitter produced a fundamentalone-point gravity vector (or electrostatic scalar wave) that disturbs the veryfabric of the space/time grid itself and therefore is not bound by the speed oflight. Thus, a theoretical instantaneous Tesla wave, emitted from the magnifyingtransmitter, could potentially affect the planet’s geomagnetic pulse and therebybe directed to any number of targets on any continent.44This research is highly controversial and speculative, and should be read withcaution. Nevertheless, in 1977, in its May 2 issue, Aviation Week published aseven-thousand-word article on Soviet particle-beam weapons. The exposé, which“shook Washington,” was also abstracted in Science. It contained a schematicdrawing of a particle beam weapon which bears a remarkable resemblance toTesla’s then unpublished drawings made four decades earlier. Coupled with therealization that the Soviets were well advanced in this area, this is strongevidence in support of the claim that Tesla did, in fact, sell the schematics ofsuch a device to them in the mid-1930’s.Aviation Week also described the use of “young geniuses under [the age of]29…located at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton Ohio” who weretrying to conceive of a breakthrough in the technology; and also, surprisingly,that “the President [Jimmy Carter] was screened from vital technicaldevelopments by the bureaucracy of the CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency.” Thesource was General George Keegen, former head of Air Force Intelligence.45Three intriguing points emerge: (1) the concept of intense secrecy ofparticle-beam weapons; (2) the mention of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base; and(3) the policy of utilizing bright young geniuses. All of these variables areevident in the FBI files on Tesla reviewed earlier. Great support is lent to theconspiracy hypothesis that Tesla’s work and papers were systematically hiddenfrom public view in order to protect the trail of this top-secret research,which today is known as Star Wars.Particle-beam weaponry is still more a dream than a reality, at this time in1996. Therefore, if indeed the inner sanctum of one or both superpowers hasaccess to Tesla’s plans, why is it that no death ray has ever been constructed?Perhaps there are prototypes, but it seems to me that they should have beentried out in the field during such wars as Vietnam, Afghanistan, or Kuwait/Iraq.This part of the story must remain a mystery."},{"pageContent":"48THE WIZARD’S LEGACY [002-toc.html#ch48]> When a man looks back over the events associated with his work…he begins to> realize how minor is that part which he himself has played in shaping the> events of his career, how overpowering the part played by circumstances> utterly beyond his control.> > EDWIN ARMSTRONG ACCEPTING THE EDISON MEDAL1As an echo from the Tesla-Morgan affair, Edwin Armstrong had to battle the giantRCA to get FM accepted over AM radio, even though it was a superior means fortransmitting music. Col. David Sarnoff, “Napoleonic” head of RCA and NBC, hadsimply pirated his friend’s FM invention because he required it for use intelevision. With the help of CBS, Sarnoff also manipulated the FederalCommunications Commission (FCC) to create a stipulation that severely restrictedthe power of FM transmitters “to one tenth their intended level…and shifted theFM band to a less desirable frequency range.” That is why AM became the dominantband for long-distance radio transmission.Required to rebuild his own radio station because of the FCC ruling and forcedto battle the media Goliath in the courts for patent infringement, Armstrongcashed in his remaining block of RCA stock to finance the enormous expenditurethat would be required. Lawyers for NBC were able to persuade the high court inNew York that it was their engineers that invented FM and not Armstrong!Although the Institute of Radio Engineers as a group filed a formal protest (anunprecedented move in such situations), which eventually caused the ruling to bereversed by the Supreme Court, it was too late for Armstrong. With his marriagein shambles, his key patents expired, and his fortune drained by litigation, hejumped out a thirteen-story window in the dead of winter of 1954, spirituallytrammeled by the very people who profited from his creative endeavors. ThatTesla survived such a fate is a testament to his fortitude and transcendentnature.2In 1956 there was a celebration of the centenary of Tesla’s birth. To highlightthe event, with Nobel laureate Niels Bohr as a speaker, a centennial congresswas held in Tesla’s honor. Simultaneously, the Yugoslav Postal Service issued acommemorative Tesla stamp, and the Yugoslav government placed Tesla on the 100dinar note (equivalent to a U.S. dollar). Statues of the inventor were placed atmuseums in Zagreb and Vienna, a school was named after him in Illinois, a Tesladay was proclaimed in Chicago, and in Munich the Institute ElectrotechnicalCommittee agreed to adopt the name “tesla” as the unit of magnetic flux density.Now Tesla could take his rightful place beside such other luminaries as Ampère,Faraday, Volta, and Watt.Twenty years later, as a gift from the Yugoslavian people, in 1976 a statue ofTesla by sculptor Franco Krsinic, was placed at Niagara Falls and an identicalcompanion statue erected on the village square in Gospić, Croatia, where Teslawas raised as a boy. (Unfortunately, this Gospić statue was purposely blownapart during the war in 1993.) President Tito gave a speech in Tesla’s honor inSmiljan before thousands of Croats, Serbs, and Bosnians (who were separated byarmed guards and demarcation fences), and the celebration also continued inAmerica. Plaques were posted at the site of his residence at the Hotel Gerlachin New York City and at the Wardenclyffe laboratory, which still stands atShoreham, Long Island.In 1983 the U.S. Post Office honored Tesla, along with Charles Steinmetz, PhiloFarnsworth, and, alas, Edwin Armstrong, in a block-offour commemorative stamp.In Boston a giant Tesla coil can be found at the Museum of Science, and Tesla’spicture can be found hanging in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.There are also two major organizations in his honor, the Tesla Memorial Society,in Lackawanna, New York, and the International Tesla Society, which has heldconferences every two years since 1984 at the society’s headquarters in ColoradoSprings.William Whyte wrote in The Organization Man that as beneficial as the largecorporations can be, they are also static, delusory, and self-destructive.During the inevitable conflict between the individual and society, theorganization man is caught in a bind because the company provides a livelihood,but at the expense of the worker’s individuality. This is what Whyte calls a“mutual deception”: “It is obvious to fight tyranny; it is not easy to fightbenevolence, and few things are more calculated to rob the individual of hisdefenses than the idea that his interests and those of society can be whollycompatible…One who lets the Organization be the judge ultimately sacrificeshimself.”3The corporate view becomes the very embodiment of rationality itself,structuring, restructuring, and thereby controlling consciousness.4 As was thecase with the Tesla situation, the more the corporate world rejected theWardenclyffe idea, the more unworkable it appeared to the engineers working inthe industry, because they, as products and extensions of the corporations, hadtheir consciousness shaped by its policies. Ultimately, Tesla’s worldview becamea threat, and it was easier to dismiss him as an eccentric than consider thathis plans may have been viable.A modern example of a famous innovator who became somewhat of a nonperson isSteven Jobs, cofounder of Apple Computer. Realizing, in the mid-1980s, that theMotorola microprocessor was superior for graphics capabilities to the one in theApple II computer and the one being used by Bill Gates/Microsoft for IBM, Jobsproduced the Macintosh. First-generation Macintoshes, which were admittedlyunattractive for business use and constructed so that they were not expandable,were not immediate successes in the marketplace. The inferior IBM disk operatingsystem (DOS) was, of course, the standard. Undeterred, Jobs wanted to scrap theobsolete but highly profitable Apple II to go solely into production of Macs.Even though he was the wunderkind cocreator of the billion-dollar enterprise,Jobs became a threat to its financial stability. In a stunning move, Jobs wasnot only deposed; he was literally barred from working at Apple, even though hewas still the largest shareholder! A decade later, the Bill Gates/IBM-compatible(Intel/Pentium) chip, although endowed with graphics (Windows) capabilities, isstill based on an inferior design as compared to the Power-Mac. Nevertheless,the Gates/Intel chip is by far the leading system in the country, even thoughthe Power-Mac by necessity is the standard in such fields as graphic design.Coyly, Gates said it this way: “People were coming out with completely newoperating systems, but we had already captured the volume, so we could price itlow and keep selling…[And] believe me, it would have been a lot easier to writeWindows so it didn’t run DOS applications. But we knew we couldn’t make thetransition without that compatibility.”5PSYCHOANALYSISBeing aware of the criticisms of the Freudian paradigm and the problem ofoversimplification, I argued in my doctoral dissertation that in order toexplain Tesla’s unusual personality, self-proclaimed celibacy, and allegedhomosexuality, it is possible that he may have suffered repressed guilt feelingsassociated with the untimely death of his older brother Dane when Tesla was fiveyears old. In the throes of the Oedipal complex and admittedly overattached tohis mother, young Niko experienced great trauma not only because Dane wasDjouka’s favorite son but also because Niko was at that age of gaining hissexual identity and learning to transfer love bestowed upon himself to others.Possibly the mother rejected Tesla after Dane’s death, and thus Tesla bestowedthe love back upon himself and became narcissistic. Wishing to gain back theperceived loss of love from his mother and lost brother, later in life Teslawould unconsciously seek out figures that would combine the dynamics of “olderbrother/mother surrogates,” for example, strong, nurturing authority figures,such as Westinghouse and Pierpont Morgan. This combination of brother and mothermight also explain the confusion associated with Tesla’s sexual identity.To recapture their lost love and, in the symbolic sense, to bring the brotherback from the dead (for that would be the only way to repair the damage), Teslawould have to form a sacrifice as penance. In Westinghouse’s case, he ripped upthe royalty clause, and it cost him millions of dollars (he could have set up adeferred payment schedule);6 and in Morgan’s case, the inventor insisted thatthe financier take the larger share of the partnership, that is, 51 percent,even when Morgan suggested fifty-fifty.Due, however, to a multitude of personality factors, including egomania,overambition, and his impatient wish to crush the competition, Tesla breachedhis contract with Morgan by deciding to build a larger tower than was agreedupon. This was a self-destructive move (although it might have succeeded and wasalso, on another level, simply a calculated risk). From the psychoanalyticstandpoint, unconsciously he was hoping that the financier would forgive hissins (show his surrogate son that he still loved him) by providing him with theadditional funds to complete the tower. When Morgan said no, the unconsciouscould not face such a harsh rejection, so Tesla tried obdurately to turn the manaround; and even when it was clear that Morgan would never come through, theself-perceived surrogate son continued to try.Turning to Tesla’s persistent wish to contact extraterrestrials, from apsychoanalytic perspective these outer space entities may have symbolized beingsexisting in the afterworld. Certainly the need to believe in extraterrestrialsis a powerful and popular one. It explains why so many people accepted PercivalLowell’s “Canals of Mars” hypothesis and, in today’s world, the extremepopularity of such movies as Star Wars, Star Trek, and ET. In Tesla’s case theextraterrestrials may have prelogically stood for his dead brother and mother.The insistence that he had probably been contacted by Martians became anunconscious safety valve which allowed him to hypercathect (release) much of theanxiety associated with the death of his older brother, as the brother wouldstill be, in a sense, alive. Thus, if Dane still existed, the trauma of hisdeath would be diminished, and Niko’s mother would love him again.This form of regressive behavior could also explain Tesla’s obsession withcaring for pigeons. After Dane died, the family was wrested from their idyllicfarm in Smiljan to the bustling city of Gospić. The pigeons were not onlysubstitute mistresses for Tesla; they also symbolized a return to the utopia ofhis early and untroubled childhood in Smiljan.As a counterhypothesis to the psychoanalytic paradigm (and as no solid evidenceof homosexuality has been discovered by this researcher), one must place Teslawithin his time period. Like William James and other intellects of that day, theidea of dedicating oneself to science at the expense of marriage was not aunique occurrence. Tesla was keenly aware that the responsibilities of marriagewould have interfered too greatly with his inventive élan. Purposely, andadmittedly through self-denial, he transformed his instincts in the alchemicalsense to raise them to a higher level. This view, however, does not completelyexplain the natural proclivity to partake of the passions, especially when oneconsiders that at his height, in the Gay Nineties, the rising star couldprobably have had his pick of any number of willing females, for example,Marguerite Merrington. Nor does it explain his overattachment to the citypigeons.Nevertheless, the Freudian paradigm falls short in its attempts to explain thenature of Tesla’s wizardry in that it tends to see this ability as a sublimationrather than an end in itself. Tesla’s emphasis on ritual and such obsessions ascleanliness and self-denial were just as much linked to his childhood bouts withcholera, caused by impure drinking water, as to his wish to change his state ofconsciousness through a set routine so that he could prepare his mind to do itswork. Unlike most inventors, Tesla’s creativity did not just lie in one plane.He adapted his mental faculties to a number of separate fields, designingfundamental inventions in lighting, electrical power distribution, mechanicalcontrivances, particle-beam weaponry, aerodynamics, and artificial intelligence.This great versatility of achievement places the inventor in a category all hisown. Ultimately, Tesla was a journeyman searching for the Holy Grail. His goalwas nothing short of altering the very direction of the human species throughextensions of his effort.CULT FIGURE> It was the coil that I noticed first—because I had seen drawings like it years> ago…“Hank, do you understand?

The event wasplanned by three individuals: George Van Tassel, author of I Rode a FlyingSaucer; George King, purported telepathic contactee with extraterrestrials, andMargaret Storm, author of the occult Tesla biography Return of the Dove, a bookwhose “transcripts were received on the Tesla set, a radio-type machine inventedby Tesla in 1938 for interplanetary communication.” By July 1 it was assuredthat the “Martians” would have “full scale operations” in Washington, D.C., NewYork, and “general North American areas.” It was also revealed that “Tesla was aVenusian, brought to this planet as a baby in 1856, and left in a remotemountain province in what is now Yogoslavia [sic].”In attendance at this meeting was a man who preferred to remain unnoticed. Hewas an FBI agent assigned to continue the expanding file on the enigmaticSerbian inventor Nikola Tesla. It is quite likely that a copy of thisnewsletter, which is in the FBI file, was also read by J. Edgar Hoover, a manconcerned about the growing interest in the flying-saucer phenomena and thesecrecy surrounding various adherents.Margaret Storm’s supposition that Tesla was born on another planet to give usour entire electric power and mass communications systems stemmed from acolorful history of the inventor’s ties to the group-fantasy belief that life onMars was a virtual certainty. Fueled by McCarthyism and the fear of Communist(alien) infiltration and also theosophical literature, Storm proclaimed thatTesla had descended from the sixth-root race, a new species of human that wasevolving on the planet. To complicate matters, she was also friends with ArthurMatthews, author of Wall of Light: Nikola Tesla and the Venusian Spaceship. Abizarre electrician who had once written to Tesla in the 1930s, Matthewscontended that he and his supposed employer, Tesla, had traveled many times tonearby planets aboard Venusian spacecraft and that Tesla, as late as 1970, wasstill alive, living as an extraterrestrial.8Relegated to occult status for many decades, Tesla has also been fictionalizedas one of any number of mad scientists in science-fiction literature, as part ofthe composite New Age hero John Galt in Ayn Rand’s novel Atlas Shrugged, as asource for future technology in James Redfield’s 1996 bestseller The TenthInsight, and as the extraterrestrial (played by rock star David Bowie) in theNicholas Roeg movie The Man Who Fell to Earth. As a cult figure in the UnitedStates, Tesla has also seen a panegyric resurgence with the younger generationbecause of a rock band which goes by the same name.In Japan, however, Tesla’s cult status is much more complicated. On the onehand, Dr. Yoshiro NakaMats, the world’s leading inventor, whose creationsinclude the floppy disk, is a great proponent of Tesla and has created acelebration in Tesla’s honor. On the other hand, Tesla’s secret weaponry workhas also attracted the attention of one of the most dangerous cults of moderntimes.Just one month after the January 1995 earthquake in Kobe destroyed the city andkilled 5,000 people, followers of the “charismatic psychopath” Shoko Ashara, theman responsible for poisoning the subways with Sarin gas in Tokyo, flew intoBelgrade to infiltrate the Tesla Museum with hopes of obtaining the inventor’sschematics for his supposed telegeodynamic earthquake machine. Ashara’s cult,known as Aum Supreme Truth, had an Internet of supposedly tens of thousands ofmembers in a half dozen countries with access to state-of-the-art high-techdevices, a large data base of military secrets, firearms, and laser apparatus,and other more esoteric New Age weaponry systems. Seeking world domination,their plans were interrupted by the earthquake. Rather than seeing the event asa natural occurrence, Ashara suggested that the Kobe disaster was caused byelectromagnetic experiments conducted by one of the Japanese megacorporations orby American or possibly Russian military tests of a top-secret Teslatelegeodynamic instrument.Raised in a country that had seen its cities destroyed by the atom bomb, Asharahad been influenced by apocalyptic science fiction stories, by the book TeslaSuperman written by Japanese author Masaki Shindo, and by such Teslaphiles asLt. Col. Tom Bearden, whose model for the Tesla magnifying transmitterhypothesized that it could be used as an intercontinental “electrostaticscalar-wave” delivery system. Realizing that Armageddon was at hand, the Kobeearthquake being proof of the prophecy, Ashara now planned to seize the highground by constructing his own “Tesla howitzer” while at the same timeperfecting the death ray.9Christopher Evans, in his text Cults of Unreason, suggests that cults appear as“stop-gaps” for people in society—ways for them to deal with life’s mysteriesand also for the unsettling feeling associated with the rapid pace of ourtimes.10 According to Evans, cults exist in order to discover the “Holy Grail,”the supposed secret behind the universe. Tesla himself called his magnifyingtransmitter the “philosopher’s stone.” To him, it was the mechanism by which totransform society and interlink the entire globe. Following a Goethean path,Tesla’s weltanschauung suggested a hierarchy of intelligence to the universe.Not only were his creations derived from natural law, through them, humans couldattain godlike status and communicate with other interstellar neighbors.“According to the idea of esotericism, as applied to history,” says Russianphilosopher P. D. Ouspensky, “no civilization ever begins of itself.”11 Esotericschools involve other (higher) dimensions, says astrologer Dane Rudyar. Certainindividuals, often referred to as avatars, Rudyar suggests, are actually “seedmen” who one way or another have within their being knowledge that can lead aculture into transcendence.Tesla had possession of certain knowledge which for various reasons was rejectedby mainstream science and society or suppressed by powers that perceived hiscontributions as threatening. Yet the essence of Tesla’s work is available forthe seeker. Described by popular New Age writer Robert Anton Wilson as an“illuminati,” Tesla remains a cult hero because of his esoteric status, becausehis life’s work has served as a template for numerous science-fiction charactersand cinematic themes, and because he provides answers for those who study hiswork for its inner meaning.12Unlike so many other esoteric figures, however, Tesla is in a unique positionbecause so many of his inventions were incorporated into our modern high-techworld. Had his ultimate world broadcasting plan actually coalesced during hisheyday, there is no telling how history might have proceeded and how the qualityof our lives might have changed.image 34 [images/image-34.jpg]The Tesla particle beam weapon. (© Lynn Sevigny 1995)"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX ATHE MAGNIFYINGTRANSMITTER: A TECHNICALDISCUSSION [002-toc.html#appendixa]At the 1990 International Tesla Conference held in Colorado Springs, Dr.Alexander Marincic, curator of the Tesla Museum in Belgrade; Robert Golka, theonly modern electrical engineer to construct large-scale magnifyingtransmitters; and I were engaged in a conversation on the viability of Tesla’splan. Both Marincic and Golka concurred that Tesla’s ultimate plan, that ofsending energy around the earth for industrial purposes, was not practicable.Leland Anderson, an electrical engineer and Tesla expert for nearly forty years,agreed. Tesla’s experiments at Colorado Springs, according to Anderson, wereprobably a local effect caused by the fortuitous placement of his tower next tothe Pikes Peaks range along a great plain. When Tesla detected lightningdischarges and standing waves, he made the incorrect assumption that these waveswould encircle the globe. In fact, Anderson wrote, the standing waves Tesladetected were probably “unrecognized reinforcement effects” rebounding off PikesPeak, and his generated waves probably did the same thing. His conclusion wasbased on measurements that electronic scientist Ralph Johler made ofthunderstorms occurring along the peak.1Two experts who have concluded that the Tesla apparatus was viable are ProfessorJames Corum and Eric Dollard, both designers of transmitting equipment based onTesla’s findings. Dollard writes that the invention (circa 1920) of the“multiple loaded flat top antenna” by “Steinmetz’s protégé, Ernst F. W.Alexanderson,” was really “fashioned after those developed by Tesla.” One suchplant, located at Bolinas, California, sets up a resonant transformer betweentwo separate “earth plates” and an “elevated plate.” This arrangement producesthree separate types of wireless frequencies: “atmospheric induction, antennatransmission, and earth induction.” Acting as a “virtual ground” the aerialtransmitting energy down into the earth sets up standing waves that“continuously bounce back and forth between the earth and the reflectingcapacitance at a rate tuned to a natural rate of the earth.”2A simple tuning fork experiment can be used to explain the importance of theground connection. It resonates much more powerfully when the fork is attachedto a ground, such as a table. Due to the conductive property of the earth,individualization of impulse transmission is also facilitated. The electricalenergy “does not pass through the earth in the ordinary acceptance of the term,it only penetrates to a certain depth according to the frequency.”3Corum, who holds a doctorate in physics and is a former professor of electricalengineering at West Virginia University writes, “It has been common in the pastto discard Tesla’s far-sighted vision as baseless. [I] believe that suchdepreciation has stemmed from critics that were uninformed as to Tesla’s actualtechnical measurements, and physical observation.” Having performed variousexperiments himself, Corum surmises that Tesla’s mathematical results written inhis May 16, 1900, patent application “could have only been obtained as a resultof authentic terrestrial resonance measurements.” In other words, he concludesthat Tesla’s claims that he (a) measured a terrestrial pulse that rebounded offthe antipode of the earth and (b) calculated the resonant frequency of the earthare essentially correct.4Looking at the wireless project from the technical point of view, most likely,Wardenclyffe was to be set up mainly for the purpose of distributing informationand meager amounts of electrical power, just enough to run clocks and stocktickers, but not enough to charge factories. Each tower could act as a sender ora receiver. In a letter to Katherine Johnson, Tesla explains the need for wellover thirty such towers.5Further, the magnifying transmitter was conceived to transmit electricity in avariety of ways. Tesla could utilize the carrier waves traveling within theearth (e.g., the Shuman cavity, and/or the earth’s geomagnetic pulse), he couldtransmit frequencies through the air, or he could beam a carrier wave up to theionosphere and use it for transport:> I will confess that I was disappointed when I first made tests along this line> on a large scale. They did not yield practical results. At the time, I used> about 8,000,000 to 12,000,000 volts of electricity.

In other words, the length of the wireswound in the transformer were in a harmonic relationship to the distance lightwould travel in a given time. With the production of standing waves resonantwith the planet, “nodal points” on the earth’s surface were also plotted out.8A tremendous charge, in excess of 30 million volts and in a harmonic frequencyto the electrical and/or geophysical state of the earth, would be driven downthe tower, into the ground, and out to sixteen 300-foot- long iron spokespositioned in a spiral down the entire length of the 120-foot well. Therebygripping the earth, this pulse would generate an electronic disturbance in aharmonic relationship with the naturally occurring geomagnetic pulse that wouldreach the other side of the globe and in turn would bounce back up the tower. Bycontrolling the period of frequency, this pulse could be modulated and actuallyincreased in intensity in the same way one can make a well-made bell resound inincreasing loudness by tapping it at precisely timed faster and faster rates.Also, the energy would be stored at the top of the tower and in specially builtcondensers by the laboratory. Stationary waves in resonance with known earthcurrents would thereby be established.9Like a vibrating spring with a weight on it, this device enabled Tesla todetermine and manipulate the electrostatic capacity (in analogy, like thepliability of the spring) and the inductance (analogous to the weight on thespring) of the carrier vibrations.10 Tesla also maintained that the use ofliquefied air (-197°F) would greatly augment the production and/or reception ofvery high frequencies while also reducing impedance caused by friction orheat.11 By transforming energy to higher frequencies on the rebound flow, Teslaincreased the efficiency of his towers. Each could act as both a sender andreceiver. One tower situated near a waterfall could “jump” energy to anothertower situated at another point on the globe.Just as electricity is available throughout the electrical circuits that runthrough the transmission lines that circumscribe our planet, electricity wouldalso be available throughout the entire electromagnetic grid of the earthitself. In the same way electricity is not utilized by conventional means untila plug is placed in a socket and a switch turned on, electricity would also notbe utilized in the Tesla system until it too was connected up to a wirelessinstrument and that instrument was turned on. Electricity by the Tesla systemwould not be wasted by being diffused, no more so than electricity is wasted bypresent means, such as with wireless car telephones or by being made availablethrough transformers and high-tension wires that run from transmission pole totransmission pole.12It appears that the tower could at this point serve in a variety of ways. Forinstance, intelligible signals (wireless telephone) could be transmitted to anyregion of the globe. Power also could be provided by the same mechanism,probably within a confined region of each tower, to thousands of specificmachines after they sent a coded request impulse or simply to another tower notlocated by a power source. And this second tower, situated in a remote area,could be connected to home appliances and telephones by way of conventionalwires or by wireless. If two transmitters were utilized and separated by manymiles, vector waves could more easily place impulses in desired locations.13Referring to Figure 1: A power source (such as coal or water) would generateenergy into a transformer comprising both a secondary (tuned to the wavelengthof light) and primary coil. The secondary coil in the transmitting tower wouldbe the inside thinner one, which is longer and has more turns. The generatedfrequency would be lowered when induced into the thicker primary, which hasfewer turns and is shorter. The transmitter would then pump the energy into thenatural medium, broadcasting it via earth or air (i.e., two different ways).According to Tesla:> At the receiving station, a transformer of similar construction is employed;> but in this case, the longer coil [of many turns]…constitutes the primary, and> the shorter coil [of fewer turns]…the secondary…It is to be noted that the> phenomenon here involved in the transmission of electrical energy is one of> true conduction and not to be confounded with the phenomena of electrical> radiation.14AN ADDITIONAL CRITICISME. Kornhauser, a professor of electrical engineering at Brown University, inreviewing this section, is doubtful that this form of power transmission couldbe effectively achieved because the earth is not an efficient conductor (e.g.,as compared to a copper wire). Concerning the possibility of creating wirelesscommunication that could circumscribe the planet, Kornhauser conceded it waspossible. He stated that the navy had unsuccessfully tried to institute a worldradar system utilizing extremely low frequencies. Project Seafarer, as it wasnamed, purportedly could have set up communication even with submarines deepunderwater at any point of the globe. However, the plan was scrapped, itappears, mainly because of the potential to markedly disturb existing radio andtelevision frequencies and fear of damage to the environment.image 35 [images/image-35.jpg]Figure 1. The sending and receiving magnifying transmitters are builtessentially the same way. The length and size of the tower and transformer is ina harmonic relationship to the electromagnetic properties of the earth. It has amultipurpose function. Standing waves generated in resonant relationship toknown Earth currents could be used as carrier frequencies for transmittingelectrical power.The efficiency of Tesla’s radio receiving tubes was also questioned byKornhauser, who thought it was doubtful that they would have been efficientenough as it would take another fifteen years before radio tubes of any meritcame into being. Kornhauser did say, however, that the modern AM radiobroadcasting stations use the earth as their primary means of transmitting theirimpulses. FM and television also use the earth, but the atmosphere in theseinstances is the more important medium for impulse transmission."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX BTHE TUNGUSKA INCIDENT [002-toc.html#appendixb]A question often asked is whether Tesla had anything to do with the massiveexplosion which occurred in Tunguska, Siberia in June of 1908. As no meteor orcrater was found, a rumor stemming from Andrija Puharich, picked up by Tad Wisein his Tesla novel suggested that Tesla used Wardenclyffe to deliver the charge.Since the tower became disoperational in 1903, I saw no reason to include theincident in the first edition of Wizard. However, because the story was repeatedon TV, rumors have persisted. Roy Gallant estimates in his book The Day the SkySplit Apart that the Tunguska explosion devastated a forty square mile area, andreleased energy 2,000 times greater than the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima!Tesla expert James Corum allowed that if Tesla had the capability of releasingjust 1% of the earth’s magnetic charge, in theory, he could have producedcomparable results. However, both Corum and the author are in agreeement thatTesla not only did not do this, but further, Wardenclyffe simply had nowherenear that kind of capability. As Gallant suggests, the Tunguska explosion wasprobably caused by a comet or asteroid, which barely missed the earth byskipping along its atmosphere two or three miles above the site."},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHY [002-toc.html#bibliography]FREQUENTLY USED ABBREVIATIONSNT Nikola TeslaFOIA Freedom of Information ActCSN Colorado Springs NotesITS International Tesla Society, Colorado Springs, Colo.TMS Tesla Memorial Society, Lackawanna, N.Y.RESEARCH FACILITIESLA Leland Anderson, personal archives, Denver, Colo.American Friends of the Hebrew University, New York, N.Y.SWP Avery Library, Manuscript Division, Columbia University, New York,N.Y.

Beckhard, Electrical Genius, Nikola Tesla (NewYork: Julian Messner, 1959). Beckhard’s book, clearly written for young adults,utilized only one referenced source, the O’Neill work. An imaginative writer,Beckhard made up the names of the townspeople from Tesla’s childhood as well. InTesla: Man Out of Time (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1981) MargaretCheney repeats the rumor without referencing it.

Letter to Westinghouse Corporation, February 6, 1898 [LC]; Tesla may havealso been influenced by the consensus concerning the noble profession ofscientist. For instance, Louis Pasteur also refused to seek financialcompensation for his discoveries.

It was the term “without effort” which I believe has been misinterpreted.From Tesla’s point of view, energy was not truly available without effort.Machines instead of humans could be constructed that would extract this “freeenergy.” Solar, wind, and water power are all ways to extract “free energy”without the exertion of human effort.25.

Hertz’s decision to eliminate scalar potentials was also a puzzlement toOliver Heaviside, who corresponded frequently with the German scientist duringthis same period. “I am quite of your opinion, that you have gone further onthan Maxwell,” Heaviside wrote in 1889, “[but] electrostatical (scalar)potential and magnetical (scalar) potential ought to remain I think.” Heaviside,however, like Hertz, was in agreement with the idea of dispensing with vectorpotentials.57.

Tesla researcher Tom Bearden has gone so far as to say that the Hertziandecision to eliminate scalar waves and vector potentials from Maxwell’sequations created a flaw in the next theoretical development called quantummechanics. It was for this reason, Bearden speculates, that Einstein could notcreate a unified field theory. Bearden suggests bringing back these componentsalong with another abandoned aspect called quaternion theory. He furthersuggests that by utilizing Tesla transmitters to produce converging powerfullypumped scalar waves, spinners and twisters can be created, that is, localspace/time can be curved, and large amounts of power can be transmittedwirelessly over long distances (Tom Bearden, “Scalar Waves and TeslaTechnology,” paper presented at the International Tesla Society Symposium,Colorado Springs, Colo., August 1988).61.

According to present-day understanding, the ionosphere, orKennelly-Heaviside layer, does not act as a carrier of the electrical waves, asTesla hypothesized, but as a reflector, causing the energy “to bounce back andforth rapidly for long-distance transmission,” and that is how it goes aroundthe entire curve of the earth (Stanley Seifer, private correspondence, 1985).14.

The primary of the coil was a specially prepared cable spanning the insideperimeter of the building itself, and the secondary was a tubular shaped smallercoil in the center of the structure which encircled a transmission tower thatrose from a support column as a single spire. With a removable roof to augmentthe adjustment of the aerial, and a small bulb at its apex, the transmittercould be extended to a variable length that could reach a maximum of 200 feetfrom the ground. A. Marincic, Colorado Springs Notes Commentary, in NikolaTesla, Colorado Springs Notes, A. Marincic, ed. (Belgrade, Yugoslavia: NikolaTesla Museum, 1979).20. Due to Tesla’s extraordinary powers of eidetic imagery, a myth, perpetuatedby O’Neill and Tesla’s own autobiography, arose suggesting that the inventorworked out all designs and calculations solely in his mind. The originalcurators of the Tesla Museum therefore kept the Colorado notebook a secret, asthey did not want to destroy this image of the inventor’s extraordinary mentalabilities. According to the present curator, Dr. Marincic, “The appearance ofthe Colorado notebook would show Tesla to be human, that he made mistakes, andso on.” Marincic’s position was totally different. He felt that the more peopleunderstood the real Tesla, the better would be the appreciation of hisaccomplishments. It was for this reason that Marincic prepared the notebookwhich was published by the musuem in 1979 (Tesla Museum, A. Marincic, ColoradoSprings, August, 1990.)21.

Recent biographers, such as Hunt and Draper, attributed the impulses to“radio waves coming from the stars” or to pulsars. Tesla researcher Prof. JamesCorum suggests that he may have intercepted pulsed frequencies emanating fromJupiter or “the morning chorus,” which are charged particles that “slosh backand forth between the North and South poles in the early morning.” Additionalpossibilities include other natural phenomena associated with the lightningstorms or telluric currents, faulty equipment, or self-delusion.18.

When exciting both coils, smallfireballs sometimes appear. Placing a “thumbprint of carbon” on one of the coilsalso helps augment the process. It is possible, in this latter case, that themicroparticles of carbon, when electrified, attract additional charges. RobertGolka, another Tesla researcher, has also produced fireballs. He suggests thatrotational motion of a boundary layer of charges may be involved in the process.James Corum, “Cavity Resonator Developments,” lecture before the InternationalTesla Society, Colorado Springs, August 1990.17.

One curious feature to this episode is that aside from lighting patentsdating from 1890 to 1992, no circa-1900 Tesla patents have been uncovered whichare specifically written up to describe fluorescent or neon lighting. Thisconclusion is corroborated by correspondence with other Tesla researchers (e.g.,Leland Anderson and John Ratzlaff). If Tesla drafted patents on this invention,they were never filed in Washington. There may be copies in Morgan’s archives orthe Tesla Museum, or the invention might be somehow linked to other patents. Acongressional investigation provides tangential evidence that Morgan purposelysquelched this invention: “The introduction of fluorescent lighting in thiscountry was slowed up by GE and Westinghouse, through control of patents, lestits efficiency cut too drastically the demand for current.” (Invention and thePatent System, Report of Joint Economic Committee Congress of the United States,88th Cong., 2d sess., December 1964, p. 100.)39.

On a number of occasions, Tesla stated that Wardenclyffe was set upprimarily for transmitting telephone conversations. Apparently his plan was tocreate identical magnifying transmitter-receivers at strategic points around theglobe. These would be connected by means of wireless; however, individualsubscribers could be linked to the central stations by means of conventionalwires although a wireless connection to the local central station was alsopossible. So, for instance, a subscriber in Australia calling up America wouldmake the wireless connection via the main intercontinental trunk line. Thus, theproblem of providing free electricity was easily circumvented (My Inventions, p.178).32.

There is some evidence that Tesla travelled to Krasnodar, Russia, east ofthe Black Sea, before the fall of the czar, circa 1914-16, where he lectured andgave demonstrations “at the circus building where the Kuban cinema is now,”according to Semyon Kirlian (1896-1978). If he had actually seen Tesla (asopposed to a “Teslaic” demonstration by another engineer), this would mean thatTesla traveled to Europe probably right before World War I broke out. As he wasnegotiating with the king of Belgium, the kaiser of Germany, and engineers inItaly and Russia, it is possible that Tesla did indeed make a grand tour then,and if so, he would have most likely also visited his sisters in Croatia/Bosnia.Further evidence would be needed to support this hypothesis.

After reviewing the original caption and conferring with Tesla expertLeland Anderson, it has been ascertained that the man is not Tesla at all, butrather John Carson of AT&T. Coincidentally, this photo has been used by the GEpublic relations people on numerous occasions with all people but Einstein andSteinmetz airbrushed out. See Life Magazine, 1965 and B.

Anderson, Swezey said that the O’Neill stories of Teslawiping his plates at the dinner table were untrue, the proof beign the pigeonlink. “Meticulous,” Tesla was clearly obsessed with avoiding contaminated water,phobic and fearful of germs, and so it seems likely to this researcher that hedid, indeed, clean off his silverware and plates with napkins at eatingestablishments. Caring for pigeons, even in one’s apartment (probably in aseparate room where he kept a lab), is quite different than eating from uncleandishes.32.

Trump’s conclusion, was that since the device was similar to the Van deGraaff electrostatic generator, Soviet engineers would find no ultimate value init. This is somewhat astonishing, as Trump also enclosed an article written byTesla in 1934 in Scientific American where he states explicitly that his devicewas, operationally, completely unlike the Van de Graaff generator. As Trumpworked with Van de Graaff at MIT, it would seem that his cavalier dismissal ofthe particle-beam weapon was based on professional jealousy. To Trump’s credit,however, here we are, a half century later, and the Tesla weapon has yet to beperfected. (Trump report, FBI archives; N.

Along the way, there were many individuals and institutionsthat helped me in my research. The first person to thank is my former partner inthe field of consciousness research, Howard Smukler, who gave me the O’Neillbook in 1976 along with the nutty text Wall of Light: Nikola Tesla and theVenusian Space Ship. Shortly thereafter, in 1977, I wrote my first article onthe inventor. The second major hurdle was accomplished in 1979, after spendingtwo years poring through the microfilm letters between Tesla and J. PierpontMorgan, George Westinghouse, George Scherff, and Robert Underwood Johnson, whichwere obtained from the Library of Congress by Roberta Doren of the InterlibraryLoan Department at the University of Rhode Island (URI). After Robertatransferred to a different division, Vernice (Vicky) Burnett took over helpingme, and she continued to do so unabated for another dozen years. I would like tothank Vicky for her resourcefulness and extraordinary efforts, and the rest ofthe staff at the URI library.In 1980, I began a doctoral program at Saybrook Institute, San Francisco. Thework resulted in a 725-page doctoral dissertation entitled Nikola Tesla:Psychohistory of a Forgotten Inventor. Stanley Krippner was not only my mentor;he was also a keen editor who corrected and criticized the entire treatise. Itwas a mammoth undertaking for him, and I am most appreciative. Other Saybrookcommittee members I wish to thank include Henry Alker, Octave Baker, JurgenKramer, Debra White, and the outside reader William Braud of the Mind ScienceFoundation in San Antonio, Texas. The dissertation was completed in 1986.In 1987, I began to work full-time on a full-blown biography. Many entirely newavenues were revealed not covered in the doctoral dissertation. A number of keyindividuals, particularly Tesla experts, helped me enormously. From the start,Mike Markovitch of Long Island University provided me with important sourcematerial and translations; William Terbo, Tesla’s grandnephew, spent endlesshours over many years with me discussing various details. In Belgrade, AlexanderMarincic, director of the Tesla Museum and, in particular, his assistant,Branimir (Branko) Jovanovic, aided me in vital ways. And in the United States, Imust also thank heartily Dr. Ljubo Vujovic, Jim and Ken Corum, and the patriarchof Tesla experts, Leland Anderson, whose cache of material, which, like thedocuments provided by the Tesla Museum, was indispensable in creating thistreatise.Other experts who helped include John Ratzlaff, of the original Tesla BookCompany, John Pettibone of Hammond Castle, Paul Baker, Nick Basura, Tom Bearden,Ralph Bergstresser, Zoran Bobic, Nancy Czito, Steve Elswick, Uri Geller, ElmerGertz, Robert Golka, Toby Grotz, James Hardetsky, Mrs. R. U. Johnson, Jr., JohnKaranfilovsky, Nicholas Kosanovich, John Langdon, J. W. McGinnis, SanfordNeuschatz, Nicholas Pribic, Dr. Andrija Puharich, Sid Romero, Lynn Sevigny,Richard Vangermeersch, J. T. Walsh, Tad Wise, and Japanese inventorextraordinaire Dr. Yoshiro NakaMats. Through their works, Hugo Gernsback,Kenneth Swezey, Inez Hunt and Wanetta Draper, Herbert Satterlee, andparticularly Matthew Josephson and John O’Neill.Important institutions included the Berkeley, Cornell, Harvard, MIT, Brown, andYale University libraries, archives from the University of Prague, ColumbiaUniversity Butler and Avery libraries, the New York Public Library and New YorkHistorical Society, the Edison Menlo Park Archives, the J. Pierpont MorganLibrary, Hammond Castle, the Westinghouse Corporation Archives, Hugo GernsbackPublications, the Library of Congress, the National Archives, the SmithsonianInstitution, the FBI, the OAP and the instrument known as the Freedom ofInformation Act.I would also like to thank my close friend Elliott Shriftman for his wisdom,great generosity, and continuing encouragement; the late Prof. Edwin Gora forhis understanding of Tesla’s link to theoretical physics, Roger Pearson, formerdean of Providence College School of Continuing Education; and Raymond LaVertue,of Bristol Community College, for helping me put bread on my table; my sagaciousagent John White, who has been with the project for over ten years; Allan Wilson(for believing in me) and Donald Davidson of Carol Publishing Group; and myloyal and altruistic partner in the screenplay Tesla: The Lost Wizard, TimEaton, visual effects editor for Industrial Light & Magic of Marin County.The treatise is dedicated to my parents, Thelma and Stanley Seifer, my sisterMeri Shardin, her husband, John Keithley and their children, Devin and Dara; mybrother, Bruce Seifer, and his wife, Julie Davis; and my wonderful andunderstanding spouse, Lois Mary Pazienza, who has been with me throughout theentire twenty-year project.This book is also dedicated to the Teslarians, who seek the truth from the pastand a sane, ecologically minded technology for the future."},{"pageContent":"INDEX [002-toc.html#index]Abafi, 11AC polyphase system, 42-43, 62, 110-11, 119, 133, 145, 149, 178, 198, 201, 215,328, 350, 393, 430, 437; builds first model, 21-26, 29-30; explained 16, 22-23,47-48Adamic, Louis, 444-45Adams, Edward Dean, 76, 133-37, 151, 159, 162, 171-72, 190, 210, 230, 245, 254,385Adamick, Jimmy, 414Akâsa (Akâsha), 164-65, 169, 239, 424Albert, Prince, 93, 326Alexander I, 95Alexanderson, Ernest, 390, 471Algemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG), see Brown, Charles Eugene Lancelot;Dolivo-Dobrowolski, Michael vonAlley, Dickenson, 294Allis Chalmers Company, 398, 401alternating current (AC), 16, 36, 133.
