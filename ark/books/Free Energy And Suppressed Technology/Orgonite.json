[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"A Brief History of Orgone Research In the 1930's and 1940's, Dr. Wilhelm Reich was able to detect and measure the existence of etheric energy ( life energy, chi, etc. ), which he called orgone , using a modified geiger counter. Dr. Reich determined that stacking alternating layers of fiberglass (an organic substance) and steel wool (an inorganic substance) would actually attract and collect orgone/etheric energy of both the life-beneficial positive form (which Reich called \" OR \" or \" POR \") and harmful negative etheric energy (\" deadly orgone \" or \" DOR \"). He constructed large boxes called orgone accumulators or \" oracs \" using this simple layering principle and was able to successfully heal his patients of various ailments, including various forms of cancer, by having them sit inside the box for periods of time. In 1986, scientists at the University of Marburg, Germany published the results of a blind study 1 which showed that 30-minute orgone accumulator treatments caused consistent, positive psycho-physiological effects not seen with the all-fiberglass box used for a control, stating \"the results received in our investigation furnish evidence for the assumption that the physical properties of the orgone accumulator and its psychophysiological efficacy on human organisms, postulated by Reich and his associates, factually exist.\" Reich's work was continued in earnest in the 1960's by more open-minded Russian scientists such as Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev (1908-1983), who also scientifically proved that such unseen energies indeed exist all around us, and who's Reich-inspired work led to the unfortunate development of practical Soviet military defense applications which utilized principles of so-called \" torsion fields \" (e.g., etheric energy). Kozyrev's work, which indeed confirms both Reich's research and our empirical experiences with orgonite, was classified until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Following in their footsteps, thousands of Ph.D.-level researchers from both sides of the Iron Curtain spanning multiple generations have continued Kozyrev and Reich's pioneering work, slowly forcing"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"mainstream Western science to finally, \"officially recognize\" the concept of a universal, unseen energy medium they call \"dark matter,\" \"vacuum flux\" or \"zero-point energy,\" depending on who you ask. It is commonly understood among orgonite enthusiasts that these are all essentially describing the same thing, which Reich called \"orgone\". The Advancements of Orgonite Reich built his research lab, dubbed Orgonon , in rural Maine, USA, as this location was at the time very isolated from sources of \"deadly orgone,\" which his accumulators would collect indiscriminantly. Operating an orgone accumulator near sources of DOR (such as nuclear power plants, radio towers, etc.) has the potential of harming anyone receiving treatment inside it, so geographical location was and is an important factor for orgone accumulator operation. In 2000, a couple named Don and Carol Croft discovered through some Internet research and empirical observation that mixing catalyzed organic fiberglass resin with inorganic metal shavings, poured into small molds such as paper cups and muffin pans, would produce a substance which would attract etheric energy similarly to Reich's accumulators. Carol Croft, gifted with a keen sense of discrete energies, realized the significance of this finding and took it a step further by adding small quartz crystals to the mixture for their ability to efficiently collect, transmute and emit etheric energy. This addition to the resin/metal matrix creates a substance which functions as a self-driven, continuously-operating, highly efficient DOR → POR (negative to positive) energy transmutation factory. When orgonite is within range of a source of DOR/negative energy, it will efficiently and continuously transform it into POR/positive energy as it is being transmitted, which essentially creates positive energy transmitters out of any and all emitters of harmful negative energy, which are totally defenseless against the effect. The resin in orgonite shrinks during the curing process, permanently squeezing the quartz crystal inside which creates a well-known piezoelectric effect inside the crystal, meaning its end-points become"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"polarized electrically. It is believed this is also what causes the orgonite to function so effectively as a positive energy generator . Thus orgonite represents a very significant improvement over Reich's early work with orgone accumulators, since Reich's \"oracs\" attract deadly orgone energy as well as positive and do nothing to transmute it into a purely beneficial form, which orgonite does inherently and continuously. Within a year of this development, Don began publishing reports of his and his wife's experiences in, among other things, the tactical deployment of small pieces of orgonite near any and all sources of DOR, or life-negative energy, such as cellphone towers, nuclear power plants, underground bases and natural Earth energy gridlines and vorticies. Don included in his reports the specific life-positive, cleansing, healing, confirming effects they would notice following such \"gifting\" activities, causing Don to strongly encourage his readers to replicate his efforts in their own communities. Cloudbusting: Then and Now In addition to his effective health treatments, Dr. Wilhelm Reich also utilized his advanced knowledge of discrete energies to build and successfully test a weather modification device called a \" cloudbuster \", which operated on the principle that clouds are held together by orgone energy, and removing this energy causes clouds to rapidly disintegrate . Reich developed a superior weather prediction model which took into account the otherwise-ignored etheric component of our weather and produced more accurate weather predictions than the popular and incomplete \"pressure system\" model. Reich's cloudbuster consisted of a set of turret-mounted metal pipes connected by rubber tubing to a body of water for energetic grounding which would dissipate clouds by draining the orgone energy holding them together and, with careful and time-consuming effort, significantly alter overall weather patterns, in some cases intentionally causing the complete reversal of drought conditions in the desert in a matter of months. Reich's design was proven very effective as intended, but could also be very dangerous if mis-handled. Large amounts of DOR accumulate in the pipes during operation, and even momentary contact with bare skin has caused some operators everything from intense pain to long-term paralysis, simply from brushing past the pipes with a bare leg. Don Croft has invented a more advanced, effective and safer version of Reich's cloudbuster called a chembuster which combines the original cloudbuster's basic operating principles with the advantages of orgonite. A typical chembuster consists of 6 six-foot copper pipes embedded in a base of orgonite (typically poured in a paint bucket) with double-terminated quartz crystals in the base of each pipe to create an etheric energy vacuum effect which literally sucks the negative energy from the sky within a several mile radius into the orgonite base where it is then transmuted into harmless, beneficial positive energy . Unlike Reich's cloudbusters, chembusters can be safely left in continuous operation where they will quickly restore and maintain atmospheric energy balance within an area. In drought-stricken regions of the globe, this always occurs in the form of rain sufficient to end the drought conditions . This has been successfully demonstrated in variuos parts of Africa , California and in many other locations around the world by various dedicated individuals. The infallibly-beneficial nature of orgonite eliminates the need for special training, safety precautions, or rigorous effort to operate a chembuster, since it simply transmutes any negative energy it attracts from the atmosphere while the rest of the device functions as an etheric vortex generator, actively balancing the energy"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"between sky and ground, eliminating smog/air pollution and negatively-charged artificial cloud formations called \" chemtrails \", replacing their spreading blanket of poisonous DOR clouds with the deep blue skies and puffy white natural clouds we all remember from childhood. Detailed instructions for building your own chembuster (which costs about $150 USD using all new materials) can be found in our section on How to Make Orgonite . The Orgonite Gifting Movement It has been the experience of many chembuster enthusiasts that the widespread deployment of digital cellular communications towers across the populated areas of the world in the last several years has created a thick blanket of DOR/negative energy which saturates our homes and communities, promotes drought, negativity, fear, etc., and significantly hinders chembuster operation (among many other detrimental effects). However, it has been widely experienced that these negative effects can be disabled and chembusters can be made to start working properly again simply by tossing or burying small muffin-sized chunks of orgonite called TowerBusters (TB's) near all the cellphone towers in their area, an increasingly-popular activity which has become known as \"gifting\" , and is conducted literally all over the world now by thousands of selfless and highly- dedicated individuals and Internet-organized groups . This site is intended to provide a basic, accurate, efficient introduction to orgonite for those interested in learning more about it. If you wish to perform further research, we have a comprehensive list of informational resources in our Further Reading section. The positive, self-empowering effects of working with orgonite quickly become obvious to those who choose to make and use it.
