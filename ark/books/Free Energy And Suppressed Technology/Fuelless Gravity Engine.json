The Fuelless Gravity models 1 through 3 use an input power source such as a high efficiency air compressor and air cylinder to simply push the counter weight back up into the balance position at the 6:00 mark. The 6:00 mark is the only time energy is needed and it is only for a split second, gravity and inertia take over and do the rest! Question: Why use a standard air compressor at all? that’s not free energy? Answer: Y es it is! (it’s a small amount ) but can be used to help run, test and activate the fuelless gravity engine. Build it and you will find out what we mean. If you use a small free energy electric motor to turn the compressor the entire system can run itself! Our Fuelless Engine electric motor is great for this. Build a small 5 hp motor. Be sure to use a high efficiency air cylinder as well. This motor uses very little air at all to run. This is simply the first phase of construction, But, we do suggest that you start with the air compressor method first to test your system to make sure there is no problems, then go on to build model 4, it is far better and will produce more free energy output than models 1 - 3.

It is unlike any other gravity motor we have ever seen before The FGE2 Gravity Engine or ( Motor ) can be designed to run itself very easily! The FGE2 Gravity Engine is basically a gravity, inertia driven motor which get s it’s torque power from leverage as well as speed. The slider arms and the 33 lb weights for example, are off balanced in the 1 1:00 mark position, the longer the arm and weight is from the center shaft point, the higher the torque pounds, which can be calculated into horsepower as well. The rpms are adjustable from 1 to 600 rpms. The speed can be adjusted by adjusting the input energy of the power source at the 6:00 mark. Example: if you build the air model # 3, the more air pressure you add the more speed you gain, but efficiency is lost using the air compressor compared to using a High V oltage solenoid to move the arm weight up at the 6:00 position. In our Model # 4, the higher the voltage driven into the solenoid coil, the higher the rpms will be as well as the efficiency of the motor. The solenoid is of a special design, it uses Neodymium disk magnets (# N40 or #N38 ) as the plunger rod, thus the solenoid coil acts as a Generator as well as a linear motor plunger! The back EMF from the coil should be more than what was put into the coil to run it. The back emf can be collected and stored back into the 12 volt battery. A 12 v marine type battery is used to run a 115 volt AC inverter x 175 watts or less. The inverter is used to power a voltage multiplier circuit using diodes and special capacitors! ( See our step up voltage plans ) The multiplier steps up the voltage as high as 2000 vdc x 3 amps, the coil will only use 10 to 40 milliamps. Just imagine, the FGE2 could then be hooked up to a 10 kW x 120 v x 60 Hz generator, some of that energy could be used to run the engine itself as well as other household appliances. A 10 kW x 120 vac generator which is rated at about 500 rpms can be purchased at www.graingers.com The idea is to use very little energy at the 6:00 position of the slider arm and weight to produce more energy coming out than what is coming into the system. If we build a Gravity motor to run at about 10 hp and compare that to a commercially built 10 hp electric motor, the gravity motor would win in efficiency over the commercial 10 hp motor, in that the commercial 10 hp motor would fire at about 6 to 8 times to get the rotor to rotate at 10 hp, but our gravity engine only fires 1 time to push the weight back up into a perfect balance position which is from the 6:00 position to the 12:00 position and our gravity motor uses a free energy solenoid to do it! If you purchased our #362 Fuelless Engine plans then you will see that you can use the magnetic coil air design as well as the homemade copper pipe SW motor commutator method to switch the power on to the solenoid at the 6:00 position and turn it off at the 5:00 position,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"# F G E 2 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C re a tiv e C re a tiv e & R e s e a rc h PO BOX 557 N ew A lbany , IN. 47 151 U SA Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research 3 3 l b 3 3 l b Page 6 Part # 11 12:00 POSITION 6:00 POSITION Part # 4 # 22 Air SW lever # 17 Air T ank # 9 Air hose SW # 14 to air hose coming from air compressor # 16 High Efficient DC motor, 90 to 1000 volts # 15 High Efficient Air Compressor Special High Efficiency Air Compresso and motor. # 10 Roller Contact, hits air SW lever and turn on air to air cylinder, pushing weight up at 6:00 mark. # 19 Air release hole # 20 T o Air SW #18 AIR CYLINDER / High Efficiency uses very little air to push an enormouse amount of weight! # 21 Rocker pin P a r t # 7 Par t # 6 Pa rt # 5 Part # 3 Part # 17 Part # 1 Slider Arm Part # 2 Slider Arm Part # 12 Part # 8 1/4” steel FLYWHEEL 33 lbs 33 lbs A Basic Model # 3 Air type Gravity Motor Since the gravity motor runs at a low rpm, it is best to buy a low rpm windmill generator or build your own."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"# F G E 2 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C re a tiv e C re a tiv e & R e s e a rc h PO BOX 557 N ew A lbany , IN. 47 151 U SA Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research 3 3 l b 3 3 l b Page 7 Part # 11 12 volt dc battery 115 vac inverter 12:00 POSITION 6:00 POSITION Part # 4 Free Energy Electric Motor / Fuelless motor AIR HOSE AIR HOSE P a r t # 7 Par t # 6 Pa rt # 5 Part # 17 Part # 1 Slider Arm Part # 2 Slider Arm Part # 12 Part # 8 1/4” steel FLYWHEEL 33 lbs 33 lbs A Basic Model # 3 Air type Gravity Motor Capacitors Voltage Multiplier OUTPUT 805 vdc Capacitors = 360 v x 200 uf Diodes = 600 v x 6 amps 115 vac input + + + + + + + + + WARNING!

Riding between smooth hardened rods, steel balls within the slide roll parallel to the line of motion (coefficient of friction is 0.003). The rated load must be centered and distributed over the slide, and the base must be fully supported on a flat mounting surface, so the slide does not acts as a beam. Ball slides are lightly lubricated during assembly and are self-cleaning in normal service. Additional lubrication is required for speeds above 1800 inches per minute and is advisable at lower speeds where high loads are applied in continuous duty applications.

At the 12:00 position the arm or arms begin to move outward causing an off balance of the balanced wheel. From the 12:00 to the 6:00 position, gravity, leverage and inertia take over producing free energy . At the 6:00 position the arm is forced back up into a perfect balanced position and the heavy steel flywheel continues to rotate in a balanced state from the energy created from the inertia of the off balanced positions from 12:00 to 6:00. Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 4 Stage 5 Stage 6 Stage 7 Stage 8 Stage 9 Stage 10 If the balanced weight on both sides is moved to the left starting at the 12:00 or 11:55 position(s) it creates an off balance, producing high torque at the rotor shaft of the motor. #7 - 10 is in the perfect balance positions, if the weight was not pushed back into balance the motor would not run."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"# F G E 2 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C re a tiv e C re a tiv e & R e s e a rc h PO BOX 557 N ew A lbany , IN. 47 151 U SA Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research 3 3 l b 3 3 l b Page 10 Sh aft 1\" or 5/8\" P ill o w B e a ri n g B lo ck P ill o w B e a ri n g B lo ck 1 \" x 1 0 \" P u lle y Bas e E xte nsi on 5\" P ulley Or y ou c an ru n a L ow R PM W ind m ill ge nera tor d irect to s haft 10\" P ulley 3\" p ully to 12 dc Ge ner ato r / t o b at.

Who is suppressing the manufacturing of free energy devices, IT’S BEST THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW!...................."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Fuelless Gravity Engine How It Works: This engine uses gravity, balance, weight, leverage and inertia as it's main Free Energy Source. The weight is shifted to the left to off balance the fly wheel. this happens between the 12:00 and the 6:00 positions. from the 6:00, 3:00 to the 12:00 positions inertia takes over there is no resistance other than what comes from the air and shaft hook ups. Part #6 is the Push arm from the drawings it may look like it will hit something but it wont, it rotates with the fly wheel and completely misses parts # 7 & 5. When arm roller switch reaches the 6:00 Position it hits #22 releasing a surge of air pressure to #18 the Air cylinder. The air cylinder uses very little air to push a large amount of weight. Of course you can use much more weight than what we are showing in our drawings! Using more weight and longer slide arms will cause the engine to have more horse power. but in doing so you will have to redesign your slide arms to take that much weight. Plus the more weight and speed you have the more the whole motor will try and move around, there is a lot of force potential here! you'll have to bolt the bottom base to the floor and secure the right side to a wall, T ake it from experience your engine will tip over and hurt some one. Remember that much weight and speed is very powerful and can kill you, be careful. The speed ( Rpm's) can be adjusted up or down by simply regulating your air pressure on your compressor tank. Note: Make sure you use a high efficient electric motor for your air compressor , a 1 phase or 3 phase if you got 3 phase, or use a high efficient motor rated at 220 volt ac. the main thing you want to accomplish is to bring down your amperage as low as you can. Or better yet as we mentioned before, use our small 5 hp Fuelless Engine motor. Also use a low Rpm High CFM Compressor, This will allow you to use a low horse power and low amperage electric motor to run the air compressor NOTE: When slide extension arm is in the 6:00 Position and roller switch activates air switch you must have enough air pressure to push the arm up fast before it leaves the 6:00 position . and when it's in the 3:00 position it must be let down fast. ( the air must escape the air cylinder quickly. ) if extension arm does not come down quickly it will cause arm to prematurely come out before the 12:00 Position and offset the balance and cause the engine to slow down and be less efficient. The use of springs may need to be used. This engine is designed to provide Free Electricity for your Home. Y ou have many choices on how to build and run this engine/ motor, #1 Y ou can Make it run itself. By using a DC wind mill low rpm generator to charge a 12 volt DC deep cycle battery to run a 175 watt DC to AC 1 15 vac Inverter. The inverter is then used to power a homemade capacitor diode voltage multiplier to step the voltage up to the proper voltages used to run one of our Fuelless Engine motors ( Free Energy Electric Motors ) see our plans #362rc cost is $40 and can be downloaded or mailed. Shipping cost if mailed is $5.95, to send by e-mail download is only $3.95 for office service charges. Y ou don't have to be a machinist to build this engine, you can let a machine shop make some of the parts for you or just make it the best way you can, it may be a little less efficient but it should still work well. # F G E 2 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C re a tiv e C re a tiv e & R e s e a rc h PO BOX 557 N ew A lbany , IN. 47 151 U SA Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research 3 3 l b 3 3 l b Page 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Suppliers List P ARTS LIST Grainger's Louisville,KY . 502-499-0001 Small Parts Inc.

It is best to use a cobalt or other type of strong metal permanent magnet if you are going to build a larger hp motor. The magnets have to t ake the pounds of pressure applied to them or they could crack. Neodymium magnets are very power magnets but they will crack, it is best to use Neodymium magnets for smaller hp motors. you can use them in a larger motor if you use less weight and add longer arms to gain more leverage power to make up for the weight loss and still produce the torque you desire. If you have a large outdoor barn or such, you could build a giant gravity motor as tall and as wide as your barn. The sliders arms and weight would be about 20 feet long. Just imagine what the torque would be. WOW! And you could make one very cheap! Y ou will want to glue the magnets together using LOCTITE 326, it is a 2 part glue and is for proffesional motor use. A 2nd choice would be a 2 part 2 ton epoxy made by DEVCON co. The magnets can then be glued to a steel rod, when the magnets are connected to the steel rod, the entire rod will become one strong magnet. Be careful this is a very powerful set up. Make sure rod is secure with 2 way stoppers and push springs or pull springs. If you don’t the magnet plunger could fly out like a cannon ball and kill someone. DISK MAGNETS Polarity will depend on if the plunger pushes out or in. Build a small toy model first. It is best if you can build the solenoid to attract as in Figure B. Use #27 copper coated wire 66 lbs there of for larger motors and # 34 for a small toy motor, coil should weigh about 6 lbs. I do not know how many winds that is? Wind from left to right. Glue PVC bobbins with PVC glue that you can buy online or at any hardware stor. PVC sheets can be baought at any sign shop or sign supply company.
