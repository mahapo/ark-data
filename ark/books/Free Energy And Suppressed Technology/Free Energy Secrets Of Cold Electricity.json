Only recently has sufficient information emerged to enable me to finally piece all of the clues together and reach a definitive conclusion. In \"The Free Energy Secrets of Cold Electricity,\" I share this 27 - year odyssey and the knowledge that has evolved along the way. Edwin Gray discovered that the discharge of a high voltage capacitor could be shocked into releasing a huge, radiant, electrostatic burst. T his energy spike was produced by his circuitry and captured in a special device Mr. Gray called his \"conversion element switching tube.\" The non - shocking, cold form of energy that came out of this conversion tube powered all of his demonstrations, applianc es, and motors, as well as recharged his batteries. Mr. Gray referred to this process as \"splitting the positive.\" These claims were incomprehensible; however, because Gray did not reveal anything about the conditions the circuit had to create in order to produce the effect. This was the mystery. It wasn't until I correlated Gray's clues with an analysis by Gerry Vassilatos, published in 1996, detailing Nikola Tesla's experimental work in the late 1880\"s, that the picture started coming into focus. These ex periments resulted in the discovery of what Tesla called \"radiant energy\" and led to the development of his Magnifying Transmitter. This material was the clue that unraveled the Gray mystery. An exhaustive comparison between Gray's \"cold electricity\" syst ems and Tesla's \"radiant energy\" systems leads to the reasonable conclusion that these two discoveries are one and the same. Finally, in this light, Gray's circuit schematics are \"corrected\" and all of the omissions are filled in. It is my belief that enou gh information is provided herein to enable anyone interested in the pursuit of free energy to reproduce these \"cold electricity\" effects with relatively simple equipment. It is my hope that thousands of engineers and experimenters will now begin looking i nto reproducing this, the \"Mother Lode\" of Free Energy effects. Many people have given invaluable assistance and counsel during this journey of mine, and I wish to acknowledge them with profound thanks.

In an article authored by reporter Tom Valentine, (Figure 1) the headline read: “ Man Creates Engine That Consumes No Fuel; Invention Could Change History by 1984. ” Well, I was young and gullible but I'd sure never seen a newspaper headline like that before. The article went on to say: A California inventor has found a way to create limitless electric power without using up fuel, potentially the greatest discovery in the history of ma nkind. Edwin Gray, Sr., 48, has fashioned working devices that could power every auto, train, truck, boat and plane that moves in this land perpetually; warm, cool, and service every American home without erecting a single transmission line; feed limitless energy into the nation's mighty industrial system forever, and do it all with - out creating a single iota of pollution. After several paragraphs devoted to such subjects as raising capital and bringing a working team together, the article continued to desc ribe two very interesting tests which the writer had personally witnessed at Gray's laboratory in Van Nuys, California in the company of several other scientists: The Tattler was given a thorough demonstration of Gray's “impossible but - true” methods for u sing electricity. The first demonstration proved that Gray uses a totally different form of elect rical current - a powerful but “ cold ” form of the energy. A 6 volt car battery rested on a table. Lead wires ran from the battery to a series of capacitors, w hich are the key to Gray's discovery. The complete system was wired to two electro - magnets, each w eighing a pound and a quarter. “ Now if you tried to charge those two magnets with juice from that battery and make them do what I'm going to make them do, you would drain the battery in 30 minutes and the magnets would get e xtremely hot, ” Gray explained. “ I want you to watch what happens. ” As Fritz Lens activated the battery, a voltmeter gradually rose to 3,000 volts. At that point, Gray closed a switch and the re was a loud popping sound. The top magnet hurled into the air with tremendous force and was caught by Richard Hackenberger. A terrific jolt of electricity had propelled the top magnet more than two feet into the air - but the magnet remained cold. `The am a zing thing,' Hackenberger said “ is that only 1% of the energy was used - 99% went back into the battery. ” Gray explained, “ The battery can last for a long time because most of the energy returns to it. The secret to this is in the capacitors and in being able to split the positive. ” Whe n Gray said “ split the positive ” the faces of two knowledgeable physicists skewed up in bewilderment. (Normally, electricity consists of positive and negative particles, but Gray's system is capable of using one or the other separately and effectively.) Tom Valentine then described the second demonstration as shown in the photograph in Figure 2. Gray showed this Tattler reporter a small 15 - amp motorcycle battery. It was hooked to a pair of his capacitors, which in turn were h ooked up to a panel of outlets."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"2 Figure 2 Edwin Gray Demonstrating His Circuit Figure 3 Tom Valentine With \"Cold\" Light Bulb in Water"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"   3 The Edwin Gray Mystery Figure 4 Second Article from The National Tattler"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"4 Chapter 1 He flicked a switch and the ti ny battery sent a charge into the capacitors. He then plugged in six 15 - watt electric light bulbs on individual cords, a 110 - volt portable television set and two radios. The bulbs burned brightly, the television played and both radios blared and yet the sm all battery was not discharging. `You couldn't begin to get all this current out of that battery under ordinary circumstances,' Gray said. `This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen,' exclaimed C.V. Wood, Jr., president of the McCulloch Oil Corporation , who was also present at the demonstration. He began looking around for hidden outlets from the wall. `May I prove it doesn't come from any wall plug' Gray offered. A 40 - watt light bulb screwed into an ordinary extension socket was plugged into the panel powered by Gray's system. The following portion of the demonstration is shown in the photograph in Figure 3: The bulb lit, then Gray dropped it into a cylinder filled with water. `What would be happening if this was getting ordinary power right now?' Gray asked, as he stuck his hand in the water with the glowing light bulb. `You'd be electrocuted and that thing would be popping and sputtering until the then put his finger into the water with the light. No shock. `Gentlemen, this is a new manifestation of el ectricity,' Hackenberger said . flywheel, run the motor. Hackenberger, an electronics specialist explained, `A series of high - voltage energy spikes are developed in our circuitry. These energy units are transferred to a control unit which acts much like a d istributor in an internal combustion engine. Every time a magnet is charged, most of the energy is recycled back into the batteries without losing power. Figure 5 Article from Probe The Unknown Well, this was quite literally the most amazing thing I had ever read in a newspaper. I was completely hooked. The next week I picked up the second article in the series, titled \"Miracle No Fuel Electric Engine Can Save Public $35 Billion A Year In Gasoline Bills\" (Figure 4). It centered on an amazing new type of e lectric motor that ran on Gray's system: The silent pollution - free EMA motor recycles its own energy and can run indefinitely. Gray's prototype is powered by four 6 - volt batteries which `will wear out before they'll run down.' The same `cold' energy repell ing magnets, arranged on a Around that same time, there appeared another article in a magazine called Probe The Unknown authored by Jack Scagnetti called \"The Engine That Runs Itself.\" (Figure 5) He presented very similar information as that contained in t he articles by Tom Valentine. Gray describes the operation of his EMA motor as similar to recreating lightning: Richard Hackenberger, Vice President in Engineering for EVGray, explains how the EMA motor system operates. `Power from the high voltage section is put through a system of electrical circuitry to produce a"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"   5 The Edwin Gray Mystery Figure 6 Letter from EVGray Enterprises"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"6 Chapter 1 series of high voltage energy spikes. The spikes are transferred to a control unit, which in turn operates the maj or motor unit'. `While this occurs, the recycle/ regeneration system is recharging the battery with 60 to 120 amp pulses.' These several newspaper articles totally captivated my imagination. Shortly afterwards, my brother and I wrote to EVGray Enterprises in Van Nuys, California expressing our interest and desire to have more information. I received the following letter from them in October, 1973: \"Dear Mr. Lindemann: I would like to thank you for showing such interest in EVGray Enterprises, Inc. and for ta king the time to write us. I have also sent your brother a letter. But due to our security, we are unable to give out any information about the motor or the Company.\" (Figure 6) Needless to say, this was extremely disappointing. So, reluctantly, I put the Valentine and Scagnetti articles and the Figure 7 Cover of NewsReal Magazine letter from EVGray away in a file, which eventually grew into my very extensive research on the subject of \"Free Energy.\" Unfortunately, I didn't read any more about Ed Gray fo r the next couple of years. In 1977, however, I came across another article by Tom Valentine in an issue of a magazine called NewsReal (Figure 7) devoted to suppressed inventions. Valentine wrote about a wide variety of subjects ranging from making oil fro m coal, to making gasoline from water, to airplanes that won't stall, and other amazing inventions. Included was an update on Edwin Gray entitled, \"EMS - Electronic Power That Could Change The World's Economic Power Picture.\" (Figure 8) In this article, Ed Gray says: `I remember getting a shock when I grabbed a charged capacitor off a workbench. That simple fact never left my mind. Then I watched when the government people were testing the first radar across the Potomac River. It stuck in my mind when one o f the men explained it as `pulse out, pulse back'. And I've always been a nut about thunderstorms. I watched lightning by the hours. I noticed how much stronger it appeared to be when closer to the earth, and just naturally concluded that the more air had something to do with it. These three principles, plus a super secret means of generating and mixing static electricity, make up Gray's EMS motor.' Later in the article: `There is no motor like this in the world' Dr. Chalfin told the group. `Ordinary electr ic motors use continuous current and constantly drain power. In this system, energy is used only during a small fraction of a millisecond. Energy not used is returned to an accessory battery for reuse.' `It is cool running,' Dr. Chalfin added, putting his hand on the motor. `There is no loss of energy in the system.' Gray's first patent, issued in June of 1975, was titled \"Pulsed Capacitor Discharge Electric Engine.\" (Figure 9) I"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"   7 Figure 8 Article from NewsReal Magazine The Edwin Gray Mystery"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"8 Chapter 1 Figure 9 Gray's Motor Patent Cover Sheet Figure 10 Gray's Motor Patent Schematic received a copy of it in 1978 . It is a rather extensive patent with 18 pages, 19 illustrations, and 18 claims. It describes an engine that is run by discharging capacit ors through electromagnets that oppose each other. (Figure 10) But I discovered soon enough that if you try to build this motor according to the principles outlined in this patent, it doesn't perform anything like what was described in the Valentine articl es. In fact, it doesn't produce a cold form of electricity at all. If you happened to get into the discharge path of those capacitors, you'd be thrown clear across the room. What's more, the amount of energy that could be recycled from this arrangement is negligible compared to what Gray is talking about in those articles. It became quite obvious to me, that in spite of the fact that this patent protected the specific design of the motor, it did not reveal the technique of its operation. From the beginning, I was always more interested in the solid - state circuit. I realized that the production of cold electricity really had nothing to do with the motor and that the motor was a secondary event. After all, when Gray was popping the magnets with cold electricit y and running the TV and the light bulbs on cold electricity, he didn't need the motor. Intuitively, I knew from the outset that the key to unraveling the secret of Gray's discovery lay in an attempt to completely understand his solid - state circuit. Howeve r, the resources I had gathered thus far were inadequate at best, and by the late 70's , I had pretty much exhausted all the information that was available on this subject. During the late 1980's, I only heard rumors that Gray was continuing his work, but a ll I could really determine was that no more news articles, or anything else for that matter, ever appeared about him."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"   9 The Edwin Gray Mystery In the mid - 1990's, however, a research associate of mine told me that he had heard that Gray had been issued othe r patents and this completely intrigued me. Would these new patents contain the answers I was looking for? I didn't know for sure, but I knew I needed to get hold of these documents. Unfortunately, my associate didn't have them, and he didn't know what the patent numbers were. So once again, my search for Ed Gray's \"cold electricity\" came to a dead end, at least for a few more years. In June of 1999, while visiting the IBM Intellectual Property Network on the internet (now the Delphion Intellectual Property Network), I noticed that the search engines within the patent database had been recently updated so it was now possible to restrict a search just to the Inventor Line. \"Gray\" into a search and looked at every word in every patent from 1971 forward, you go t so many hits you couldn't possibly go through them all. Now, however, I was able to plug \"Gray; Edwin\" into the Inventor Line of this newly updated search engine. Lo and behold, on my screen 30 seconds later, the numbers of two other patents that had bee n issued to Edwin Gray came up. I was ecstatic! Figure 11 shows the first of these patents entitled \"Efficient Power Supply Suitable for Inductive Loads\" issued in June 1986. Understanding this patent will be the primary focus of this book. The other paten t entitled \"Efficient Electrical Conversion Switching Tube Suitable for Inductive Loads\" (Figure 12) was issued approximately ten months later, in April 1987. These two patents are very closely linked and are almost identical. One of them describes the cir cuit that drives this switching tube and the other one describes the switching tube itself.

Figure 13 shows the circuit diagram for the first one. I had searched 26 years for this diagram, and finally I had a chance to understand what Gray was doing. I felt sure that I wa s looking at the basis of his \"cold\" electricity circuits, but Gray was still holding his cards quite close to his chest. Reading the diagram, it was not clear how these components behaved, or what they did, or why. The more I studied the text, which is re latively short compared to the motor patent, the more I realized I was looking at something that was really quite foreign to me. Intuitively, I felt I had all the pieces, but I still didn't know how the pieces fit together, and I didn't know what the true picture looked like. Why was this circuit able to create free energy? Once again, there were still far too many unknowns. I was heartened, though, by several interesting references stated in the patent. For instance, in one small section, Gray states: Ther e is disclosed herein an electrical driving system which, on theory, will convert low - voltage electrical energy from a source, such as an electric storage battery, to a high - potential, high - current energy pulse that is capable of developing a work force at the inductive output of the device that is more efficient than that which is capable of being developed directly from the energy source. That statement may sound a bit obscure, but actually as far as I was concerned, it was a pretty sneaky way of saying \" free energy.\" Further on it says: This system accomplishes the results stated above by harnessing the 'electro - static' or `impulse' energy created by a high intensity spark generated within a specially constructed electrical conversion switching element tu be. This element utilizes a low voltage anode, a high voltage anode, and one or more electro - static or charge receiving grids. These grids are of a physical size, and appropriately positioned, as to be compatible with the size of the tube, and therefore, d irectly related to the amount of energy to be anticipated when the device is operating As I continued to read this patent, I was most intrigued by components # 42, # 44, and # 46. The patent states: A spark - gap protection device, 42, is included in the cir cuit to protect the inductive load and the rectifier elements from unduly large discharge currents. Should the potentials within the circuit exceed predetermined values, fixed by the mechanical size and spacing of the elements within the protected device, the excess energy is dissipated (bypassed) by the protective device to the circuit common (electrical ground)...\" diodes 44 and 46 bypass the excess overshoot generated when the energy conversion switching element tube is triggered. So here we have three e lements, # 42, # 44 and # 46 in this circuit, which are specifically designed to dump excess energy when this tube fires! What this suggests is that there is the possibility of producing so much energy here that it can damage the rest of the circuit. Certa inly this was quite promising, but I still didn't really understand what phenomenon would create those conditions -- or why. It was definitely apparent to me, however, that Gray expected something extremely \"large\" to happen when this conversion switching tube fired. I was convinced I had discovered the secret of the device, but I still didn't really understand what I was looking at. I needed a \"Rosetta Stone\" -- something that would translate all of these unknowns into an understandable context. Luckily, I found it. That Rosetta Stone was a book called Secrets 6f Cold War Technology: Project HAARP and Beyond, written by Gerry Vassilatos in 1996 and currently available through Adventures Unlimited Press (Figure 14). In Chapter 1,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"12 t itled \"Nikola Tesla and Ra diant Energy,\" Vassilatos recounts those heady days back around 1890, when Nikola Tesla is developing the experiments which led to the invention of his magnifying transmitter.

He was one of 14 children. At age eleven, he became interested in the emerging field of electronics when he watched some of the first demonstrations of primitive radar being tested across the Potomac River. He left home at 15 and joined the Army, attending t heir advanced engineering school for one year before he was discovered and honorably discharged for being under age. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he re - enlisted in the Navy and served three years of combat duty in the Pacific. After the War, he worked as a mechanic and continued his studies in electro - magnetics. After experimenting for years, he learned how to \"split the positive\" in 1958 and had his first Electric Magnetic Association (EMA) motor model running in 1961. His third EMA prototype was succ essfully tested for 32 days straight before it was torn down for analysis. With this report in hand, Gray started looking for serious funding. After being turned down by every major corporation and venture capital group he approached, he formed his own lim ited partnership in 1971. By early 1973, EVGray Enterprises, Inc. had an office in Van Nuys, California, hundreds of private investors and a new (# 4) EMA motor prototype. Ed Gray had also received a \"Certificate of Merit\" from Ronald Reagan, then Governor of California. By the summer of 1973, Gray was doing demonstrations of his technology and receiving some very positive press. By later that year, Gray had teamed up with automobile designer, Paul M. Lewis, to build the first fuelless, electric car in Amer ica. But trouble was brewing. On July 22, 1974 an unprovoked Los Angeles District Attorney's Office raided the office and shop of EVGray Enterprises, and confiscated all of their business records and working prototypes. For 8 months, the DA tried to get Gr ay's stockholders to file charges against him, but none would. Gray was eventually charged with \"grand theft,\" but even this bogus charge couldn't stick and was finally dropped. By March 1976, Gray pleaded guilty to two minor SEC violations, was fined, and released. The DA's office never returned his prototypes. In spite of these troubles a number of good things were happening. His first US. Patent, on the motor design, issued in June of 1975, and by February 1976, Gray was nominated for \"Inventor of the Ye ar\" for \"discovering and proving a new form of electric power\" by the Los Angeles Patent Attorney's Association. Despite this support, Gray kept a much lower profile after this time. In the late 1970's, Zetech, Inc. acquired Gray's technology and EVGray En terprises ceased to exist. In the early 1980's, Gray offered the US. Government his technology to augment Reagan's SDI program. He actually wrote letters to every member of Congress, both Senators and Representatives, as well as the President, Vice Preside nt, and every member of the Cabinet. Remarkably, in response to this letter writing campaign, Gray did not receive a single reply or even an acknowledgment! During the early 1980's, Gray lived in Council, Idaho, where he wrote and was granted his other two US Patents. By 1986, he had a facility in Grande Prairie, Texas, where a number of new prototype EMA motors were built. By 1989, he was working on propulsion applications of the technology, and maintaining his residence in Council, Idaho, as well as shop facilities in Council, Grande Prairie, and Sparks, Nevada. Edwin V. Gray died at his shop in Sparks, Nevada, in April 1989, under mysterious circumstances. He was 64 and in good health."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"14"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"   15 The following chapter is excerpted from Chapter 1 of Secrets of Cold War Technology: Project HAARP and Beyond, by Gerry Vassilatos and is reprinted here by permission of the publisher, Adventures Unlimited Press. Chapter 2: The Rosetta Stone James Clerk - Maxwell predicted the possibility that electromagnetic waves might exi st. In theoretical discussions designed to more thoroughly explain his mathematical descriptions, Maxwell asked his readers to consider two different kinds of electrical disturbances possibly existing in nature. The first consideration dealt with longitudi nal electric waves, a phenomenon, which required alternating concentrations of electrostatic field lines. This densified and rarefied pulsation of electrostatic fields necessarily demanded a unidirectional field, one whose vector was fixed in a singular di rection. The only variable permitted in generating longitudinal waves was the concentration of the field. Subsequent propagation along the electrostatic field lines would produce pulsating thrusts of charges, pulsation movin g in a single direction. These “ electrical soundwaves ” were rejected by Maxwell, who concluded that such a condition was impossible to achieve. His second consideration dealt with the existence of transverse electromagnetic waves. These required the rapid alternation of electrical fields along a fixed axis. Space spreading electrical lines wo uld supposedly “ bend to and fro ” under their own momentum, while radiating away at the speed of light from the alternating source. Corresponding forces, exact duplicates of the alterations produced at the source, would be detected at great distances. He encouraged that experimenters seek this waveform, suggesting possible means for achieving the objective. And so the quest to find electromagnetic waves began. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz announced that he h ad discovered electromagnetic waves, an achievement at that time of no small import. In 1889, Nikola Tesla attempted the reproduction of these Hertzian experiments. Conducted with absolute exactness in his elegant South Fifth Avenue Laboratory, Tesla found himself incapable of producing the reported effects. No means however applied would produce the effects which Hertz claimed. Tesla began experimenting with abrupt and powerful electric discharges, using capacitors charged to very high potentials. He found it possible to explode thin wires with these abrupt discharges. Dimly perceiving something of importance in this experimental series, Tesla abandoned these experiments, all the while pondering the mystery and suspecting that Hertz had somehow mistakenly a ssociated electrostatic inductions or electrified shockwaves in air for true electromagnetic waves. In fact, Tesla visited Hertz and personally proved these refined observations to Hertz who, being convinced that Tesla was correct, was about to withdraw hi s thesis. Hertz was truly disappointed, and Tesla greatly regretted having to go to such lengths with an esteemed academician in order to prove a point. But while endeavoring toward his own"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"16 Chapter 2 means for identifying electrical waves, Tesla was bless ed with an accidental observation, which forever changed the course of his experimental investigations. In his own attempts to achieve where he felt Hertz had failed, Tesla developed a powerful method by which he hoped to generate and detect real electroma gnetic waves. Part of this apparatus required the implementation of a very powerful capacitor bank This capacitor \"battery\" was charged to very high voltages, a n d subsequently discharged through short copper bus bars. The explosive bursts thus obtained produced several phenomena, which deeply impressed Tesla, far exceeding the power of any electrical display he had ever seen. These proved to hold an essential secret, which he was determined to uncover. The abrupt sparks, which he termed \"disruptive disc harges\", were found capable of exploding wires into vapor. They propelled very sharp shockwaves, which struck him with great force across the whole front of his body. Of this surprising physical effect, Tesla was exceedingly intrigued. Rather, more like gu nshots of extraordinary power than electrical sparks, Tesla was completely absorbed in this new study. These electrical impulses produced effects commonly associated only with lightning. The explosive effects reminded him of similar occurrences observed wi th high voltage DC generators. A familiar experience among workers and engineers, the simple closing of a switch on a high voltage dynamo often brought a stinging shock, the assumed result of residual static charging. This hazardous condition only occurred with the sudden application of high voltage DC. This crown of deadly static charge stood straight out of highly electrified conductors, often seeking ground paths which included workmen and switchboard operators. In long cables, this instantaneous charge effect produced a hedge of bluish needles, pointing straight away from the line into the surrounding space. The hazardous condition appeared briefly at the very instant of switch closure. The bluish sparking crown vanished a few milliseconds later, along w ith the life of any unfortunate who happened to have been so \"struck\". After the brief effect passed, systems behaved as designed. Such phenomena vanished as charges slowly saturated the lines and systems. After this brief surge, currents flowed smoothly a nd evenly as designed. The effect was a nuisance in small systems. But in large regional power systems where voltages were excessive, it proved deadly. Men were killed by the effect, which spread its deadly electrostatic crown of sparks throughout componen t systems. Though generators were rated at a few thousand volts, such mysterious surges represented hundreds of thousands, even millions of volts. The problem was eliminated through the use of highly insulated, heavily grounded relay switches. Former engin eering studies considered only those features of power systems that accommodated the steady state supply and consumption of power. It seemed as though large systems required both surge and normal operative design considerations. Accommodating the dangerous initial \"supercharge\" was a new feature. This engineering study became the prime focus of power companies for years afterward, safety devices and surge protectors being the subject of a great many patents and texts. Tesla knew that the strange superchargi ng effect was only observed at the very instant in which dynamos were applied to wire lines, just as in his explosive capacitor discharges. Though the two instances were completely different, they both produced the very same effects. The instantaneous surg e supplied by dynamos briefly appeared super - concentrated in long"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"   17 The Rosetta Stone L ines. Tesla calculated that this e lectrostatic concentration was several orders in magnitude greater than any voltage that the dynamo could supply. The actual supply was somehow being amplified or transformed . But h ow? The general consensus among engineers was that this was an electrostatic “ chocking ” effect. Many concluded it to be a “ bunching ” action, where powerfully applied force was unable to move charge quickly through a system. Mysterious, the combined resistance of such systems seemed to influence the charge carriers before they were able to move away from the dynamo terminals! Like slapp ing water with a rapid hand, the surface seemed solid. So also it was with the electrical force, charges meeting up against a se emingly solid wall. But the effect lasted only as long as the impact. Until current carriers had actually “ caught up ” with the applied electrical field, the charges sprang from the line in all directions. A brief supercharging effect could be ex pected until the char ges were distributed , smoothly flowing th rough the whol e line and system. The dynamo itself thus became the brief scene of a minor shockwave. He began wondering why it was possible for electrosta tic fie lds to move more quickly than the actual charges themselves, a perplexing mystery. Was the field itself an entity that simply drive the more massive charges along? If this was true, then of what was the electrostatic field itself “ composed ” ? Was it a field of smaller particles? The questions were wonderfully endless. D espite the w onderful ideas, which this study stimulated, Tesla saw a practical application that had never occurred to him. Consideration of the dynam o supercharging effect suggested a new experimental apparatus. It was one that could greatly outperform his capacitor battery in the search to find electrical waves. A simple high v oltage DC generator provided his e lectric field source. Tesla understood that the resistance of lines or components, viewed from the dynamo end, seemed to be an impossible “barrier ” for charge carriers to penetrate. This barrier caused the “ bunching ” effect. Electrostatic charges were literally stopped and held for an instant by line resistance, a barrier which only existed d uring the brief mi llisecond interv al in which the power switch was closed. The sudden force application against this virtual barrier squeezed charge into a density impossible to obtain with ordinary cap acitors. It was the brief application of power, the impact of the charge against the resistance barrier, which brought this abno rmal electro - densified condition. This is why the conductive wi res in his present experiment often exploded. The analogy to steam power and steam engines was unmistakable: Large steam engines had to be valved very carefully. This required the expertise of old and well - experienced operators who k new how to “ open up ” an engine without rupturing the vessels and causing a deadly explosion. Too suddenly valved, even a large steam engine of very hig h capacity could explode. Steam had to be admitted into a system gently, until it began smoothly and gradually flowing into every orifice, conduit, and co mponent. Here too was the mysterious “ choking ” effect, where a large capacity system seemed to behave like an uncommonly high resistance to any sudden and sustained applicati on of force. The academic world of experimenters was yet fixated on his former discovery of high frequency alternating currents. It seem ed that Tesla alone now exclusively studied these impulse discharges. He was producing explosive impulses, which had not been o bserved in laboratories. Every component was carefully insulat ed, himself implementing insulator rods and rubberized regalia to insure complete safety . Tesla had observed electrostatic machines whose"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"18 Chapter 2 ability to charge insulated metals was potent, but this demonstration exceeded the mere charging of wire by the instantaneous switch closure. This effect produced \"springing\" ch arge, phenomena like no other before witnessed by Tesla for its sheer strength. Whatever the conditions observed in previous systems, he had now learned how to maximize the effect. Balancing voltage and resistance against capacity, Tesla learned to routine ly produce supercharge states which no existing device could equal Empirical observation had long taught that ordinary capacitor discharges were oscillating currents, spark currents which literally \"bounced\" between each capacitor plate until their stored energy was wasted away. The high voltage of the dynamo exerted such an intense unidirectional pressure on the densified charges that alternations were impossible. The only possible backrushes were oscillations. In this case, charges surged and stopped in a long series until the supercharge was wasted away. All parameters which forced such oscillations actually limited the supercharge from manifesting its total energetic supply, a condition Tesla strove to eliminate. Indeed he spent an excessive time develop ing various means to block every \"backrush\" and other complex current echo which might force the supercharge to prematurely waste its dense energy. Here was an effect demanding a single unidirectional super pulse. With both the oscillations and alternation s eliminated, new and strange effects began making their appearance. These powerful and penetrating phenomena were never observed when working with high frequency alternations. The sudden quick closure of the switch now brought a penetrating shockwave thro ughout the laboratory, one that could be felt both as a sharp pressure and a penetrating electrical irritation. A \"sting\". Face and hands were especially sensitive to the explosive shockwaves, which also produced a curious \"stinging\" effect at close range. Tesla believed that material particles approaching the vapor state were literally thrust out of the wires in all directions. In order to better study these effects, he poised himself behind a glass shield and resumed the study. Despite the shield, both sh ockwaves and stinging effects were felt by the now mystified Tesla. This anomaly provoked a curiosity of the very deepest kind, for such a thing was never before observed. More powerful and penetrating than the mere electrostatic charging of metals, this p henomenon literally propelled high voltage charge out into the surrounding space where it was felt as a stinging sensation. The stings lasting for a small fraction of a second, the instant of switch closure. But Tesla believed that these strange effects we re a simple effect of ionized shockwaves in the air, rather like a strongly ionized thunderclap. Tesla devised a new series of experiments to measure the shockwave pressure from a greater distance. He required an automatic \"trip switch\". With this properly arranged, a more controlled and repetitious triggering of the effect was possible. In addition, this arrangement permitted distant observations which might cast more light on the shield - permeating phenomenon. Controlling the speed of the high voltage dyna mo controlled the voltage. With these components properly adjusted, Tesla was able to walk around his large gallery spaces and make observations. Wishing also to avoid the continuous pressure barrage and its stinging sparks, Tesla shielded himself with sev eral materials. The arrangement of rapidly interrupted high voltage direct currents resulted in the radiation of stinging rays, which could be felt at great distances from their super - sparking source. In fact, Tesla felt the stings right through the shield s! Whatever had been released from the wires during the instant of switch closure,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"   19 The Rosetta Stone successfully penetrated the shields of glass and of copper. It made no difference; the effect permeated each substance as if the shield were not there at all. Here was an electrical effect that communicated directly through space without material connections. Radiant electricity! In these several new observations, the phenomenon was violating electrostatic charge principles experimentally established by Fa raday. Projected electrostatic charges normally spread out over the surface of a metallic shield; they do no penetrate metal. This effect had certain very non - electrical characteristics. Tesla was truly mystified by this strange new phenomenon, and searche d the literature for references to its characteristics. No such reference was found, except in the surreptitious observations of two experimenters. In one case, Joseph Henry observed the magnetization of steel needles by a heavy spark discharge. The extrao rdinary feature of this observation (1842) lay in the fact that the Leyden jar, whose spark apparently produced the magnetizations, stood on the upper floor of an otherwise electrically impervious building. Brick walls, thick oak doors, heavy stone and iro n flooring, tin ceilings. Moreover, the steel needles were housed in a vault in the cellar. How did the spark affect such a change through such a natural barrier? Dr. Henry believed that the spark had released special \"light - like rays\", and these were the penetrating agencies responsible for the magnetizations. A second such account (1872) occurred in a high school building in Philadelphia. Elihu Thomson, a physics instructor, sought to make the sparks of a large Ruhmkorrf Spark Coil more visible for his ne xt lecture. Attaching one pole of the coil to a cold water pipe, and reactivating the coil, Thomson was thrilled to find that the nature of the spark had changed from blue to white. Wishing to amplify this effect, Thomson attached the other pole to a large metal tabletop. Again reactivating the coil produced a shrieking silver - white spark, entirely visible to any whom sat in the last row. Wishing to show this to a colleague, Edwin Houston, Thomson made for the door and was abruptly stopped. Touching the bra ss knob on the otherwise insulated oak door, Thomson received an unexpected sizzling shock. Turning off the Ruhmkorrf Coil, Thomson found it possible to stop the effect. Calling for Edwin, he summarized what had occurred. Then turning the unit back on agai n, the stinging charge effects returned. The two gentlemen ran throughout the huge stone, oak, and iron building with insulated metal objects now. Each touch of a penknife or screwdriver to anything metallic, however distant from the coil or insulted from the floor, produced long and continuous white sparks. The account was written up as a short article in Scientific American later in the same year. In studying each of these two prior observations, events each separated by some thirty years, Tesla perceived an essential unity with that of his own discovery. Each observation was perhaps a slight variant of the very same phenomenon. Somehow accidentally, each experimenter had managed to produce the explosive super charging effect. In the case of Dr. Henry, the explosive bursts occurred in a single flash, electrostatic machines being used to accumulate the initial charge. The second case was peculiar, since it evidenced the sustained and continuous production of super - charging effects. The effect was rare becaus e it obviously required very stringent electrical parameters. Tesla deduced this from the simple fact that the effect was so infrequently observed by experimenters the world over. In addition, he was quick to remark concerning the anomalous attributes atta ched to the phenomenon. Tesla knew that, despite the extremely penetrating effects in each case, he had secured the only means for achieving the \"complete\" and"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"20 maximum manifestation of supercharging. His was an apparatus with no equal, capable of releasi ng an aspect of the electrostatic field which others very apparently had .not. Though discovered by Tesla in 1889, the preliminary observation of this effect was published after an intensive battery of investigations. The \"Dissipation of Electricity\", publ ished just prior to Christmas of 1892, is the pivotal Tesla lecture. This is the departure point in which Tesla abandons research and development of high frequency alternating current. Divorcing himself from the field entirely, Tesla describes the shockwav es and other effects of IMPULSES. In addition to those physical sensations, which he describes in characteristic understatements, Tesla also enlarges upon the \"gaseous\" aspects associated with the phenomena. He observed that the abruptly charged wires in h is experiments projected a strange gaseous stream when immersed in an oil bath. A phenomenon, which he once thought due entirely to wire - adsorbed gases, he found that the effect could be so continuously produced from a single wire that no volume of ordinar y adsorbed gas could supply the flow. Indeed, he was able to produce streams of this kind in oil, which so powerfully projected from charged wire ends that they visibly depressed the oil into a hole, some two inches in depth! Tesla began to realize the tru e nature of the fine issuing \"gas\" which projected from wire ends immersed in oil. He now prepared an extensive series of tests in order to determine the true cause and nature of these shocking air pulses. In his article, Tesla describes the shield permea ting shocks as \"soundwaves of electrified air\". Nevertheless, he makes a remarkable statement concerning the sound, heat, light, pressure, and shock which he sensed passing directly through copper plates. Collectively, they \"imply the presence of a medium of gaseous structure, that is, one consisting of independent carriers capable of free motion\". Since air was obviously not this \"medium\", to what then was he referring? Further in the article he clearly states that \"besides the air, another medium is prese nt\". Through successive experimental arrangements, Tesla discovered several facts concerning the production of his effect. First, the cause was undoubtedly found in the abruptness of charging. It was in the switch closure, the very instant of \"closure and break\", which thrust the effect out into space. The effect was definitely related to time, IMPULSE time. Second, Tesla found that it was imperative that the charging process occurred in a single impulse. No reversal of current was permissible, else the eff ect would not manifest. In this, Tesla made succinct remarks describing the role of capacity in the spark radiative circuit. He found that the effect was powerfully strengthened by placing a capacitor between the disrupter and the dynamo. While providing a tremendous power to the effect, the dielectric of the capacitor also served to protect the dynamo windings. The effect could also be greatly intensified to new and more powerful levels by raising the voltage, quickening the switch \"make - break\" rate, and s hortening the actual time of switch closure. Thus far, Tesla employed rotating contact switches to produce his unidirectional impulses. When these mechanical impulse systems failed to achieve the greatest possible effects, Tesla sought a more \"automatic\" a nd powerful means. He found this \"automatic switch\" in special electrical arc dischargers. The high voltage output of a DC generator was applied to twin conductors through his new arc mechanism, a very powerful permanent magnet sitting crosswise to the dis charge path. The discharge arc was automatically and continually \"blown out\" by this magnetic field."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"   21 The Rosetta Stone Imperative toward obtaining the desired rare effect, the capacitor and its connected wire lines had to be so chosen as to receive and di scharge the acquired electrostatic charge in unidirectional staccato fashion. The true Tesla circuit very much resembles a pulse jet, where no backpressure ever stops the onrushing flow. Electrostatic charge rises to a maximum and is discharged much more q uickly. The constant application of high voltage dynamo pressure to the circuit insures that continual successions of \"charge - rapid discharge\" are obtained. It is then and only then that the Tesla Effect is observed. Pulses literally flow through the appar atus from the dynamo. The capacitor, disrupter, and its attached wire lines, behave as the flutter valve. The high voltage dynamo remains the true electrostatic source in the apparatus. This was a fact well appreciated by Tesla, who disliked the painful ra diant effects proceeding into space. It was evident that the dynamo had somehow been modified by the addition of these \"pulsing valve\" circuits. The dynamos being used provided deadly voltages, capable of killing a man. The valve circuits were forcing a st range radiance of those deadly field energies. Somehow, the dynamo energy was being expanded into space with dangerous and painful force. But how? By what mysterious and provocative means was this condition established? The result of this experimental seri es fixed a new concept in Tesla's mind. Tesla had of course realized the implications of his mysterious shocking - field effect. This was radiant electricity. Tesla first conducted elaborate and extensive . investigations in order to comprehend the exact nat ure of this new electrical effect. Tesla realized that this strange \"shocking field\" actually radiated through space from the impulse apparatus. If this was electrostatic energy, it was more intense and more penetrating than any electrostatic field he had ever observed. If this was merely a \"stuttered\" electrostatic field, why then was its strength so very intensified? Tesla began to believe that he had discovered a new electrical force, not simply a treatment of an existing force. It is for this reason tha t he often described the effect as “ electrodynamic ” or “ more electrostatic ” . By properly adjusting the inherent circuit parameters, Tesla learned how to produce an extremely rapid series of unidirectional impulses on demand. When the impulses were short, a brupt, and precise in their successions, Tesla found that the shocking effect could permeate very large volumes of space with apparently no loss of intensity. He also found that the shocking effect penetrated sizable metal shields and most insulators with ease. Developing a means for controlling the number of impulses per second, as well as the intermittent time intervals between each successive impulse, he began discovering a new realm of effects. Each impulse duration gave its own peculiar effects. Able t o feel the stinging shocks, though shielded at a distance of nearly fifty feet from his apparatus, Tesla recognized at once that a new potential for electrical power transmission had been revealed to him. Tesla was first to understand that electrical shock waves represented a new means for transforming the world, even as his Polyphase system had done. Tesla fully intended to disclose his discoveries to the world at large. Radiant electricity had special characteristics of which the scientific world had no k nowledge. Working with a simple but powerful embodiment of his original apparatus, Tesla found that radiant electricity could induce powerful electrical effects at a distance. These effects were not alternations, not alternating waves. They were longitudin al waves, composed of successive shocking waves. The advance of"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"22 Chapter 2 each shocking wave, followed by short neutral zones together comprised the radiant field. Vectorial components of these shockwave successions were always unidirectional. The stuttering shockwaves were capable of forcing charges in the direction of their propagation. Objects placed near this device became powerfully electrified, retaining a singular charge sign for many minutes after the magnetic discharger had been deactivated. Tesla found it possible to amplify these single charge effects by a simple asymmetrical alignment of the magnetic discharger. By placing the magnetic discharger closer to one or the other side of the charging dynamo, either force pos itive or force negative vectors could be selected and projected. Thus, charge could be projected into or drawn from any object in the field space. This was a new electrical force. Tesla realized more than ever that he was in unknown territory. The fact tha t these radiant forces traveled as light - like rays distinguished them from the electromagnetic waves of Maxwell. Tesla wished to determine the effect of gradually decreased impulse durations, a job that required the greatest skill and precaution. Tesla kne w that he would be exposing himself to mortal danger. Controlling the rapidity of current blowout in the magnetic DC arc, Tesla released a new spectrum of light - like energies throughout his large gallery space. These energetic species were like no other wh ich the world has since seen. Tesla found that impulse duration alone defined the effect of each succinct spectrum. These effects were completely distinctive, endowed with strange additional qualities never purely experienced in Nature. Trains of impulses, each exceeding 0.1 millisecond duration, produced pain and mechanical pressures. In this radiant field, objects visibly vibrated and even moved as the force field drove them along. Thin wires, exposed to sudden bursts of the radiant field, exploded into v apor. Pain and physical movements ceased when impulses of 100 microseconds or less were produced. With impulses of 1.0 microsecond duration, strong physiological heat was sensed. Further decreases in impulse duration brought spontaneous illuminations capab le of filling rooms and vacuum globes with white light. At these impulse frequencies, Tesla was able to stimulate the appearance of effects, which are normally admixed among the electromagnetic energies inherent in sunlight. Shorter impulses produced cool room penetrating breezes, with an accompanying uplift in mood and awareness. There were no limits in this progression toward impulses of diminished duration. None of these impulse energies could be duplicated through the use of high frequency harmonic alte rnations. Few could reproduce these effects because so few understood the absolute necessity of observing those parameters set by Tesla. These facts have been elucidated by Eric Dollard, who also successfully obtained the strange and distinct effects claim ed by Tesla. By 1890, after a period of intense experimentation and design development, Tesla summarized the components necessary for the practical deployment of a radiant electrical power distribution system. Tesla had already discovered the wonderful fac t that impulse durations of 100 microseconds or less could not be sensed and would do no physiological harm. He planned to use these in his power broadcast. Furthermore, shocking waves of 100 microsecond duration passed through all matter, a fitting form o f electrical energy to broadcast throughout a power - needy city. Tesla made a most startling discovery the same year, when he placed a long single turn copper helix near his magnetic disrupter. The coil, some two feet in length, did not behave as did solid copper pipes and"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"   23 The Rosetta Stone other objects. The thin - walled coil became ensheathed in an envelope of white sparks. Undulating from the crown of this coil were very long and fluidic silvery white streamers, soft discharge s that appeared to have been considerably raised in voltage. These effects were greatly intensified when the helical coil was placed within the disr upter wire circle. Inside this “ shockzone ” , the helical coil was surrounded in a blast, which hugged onto it s surface, and rode up the coil to its open end. It seemed as though the shockwave actually pulled away from surrounding space to cling to the coil surface, a strange attractive preference. The shockwave flowed over the coil at right angles to the windings , an unbelievable effect. The sheer length of discharges leaping from the helix crown was incomprehensible. With the disrupter discharge jumping 1 inch in its magnetic housing, the white flimmering discharges rose from the helix to a measured length of ove r two feet. This discharge equaled the very length of the coil itself! It was an unexpected and unheard of transformation. Here was an action more nearly \"electrostatic\" in nature, although he knew that academes would not comprehend this term when used in this situation. Electrostatic energy did not fluctuate, as did his shockwaves. The explosive shockwave had characteristics unlike any other electrical machine in existence. Yet Tesla stated that the shockwave, during the brief instant in which it made its explosive appearance, more nearly resembled an electrostatic field than any other known electrical manifestation. Just as in electrostatic friction machines, where current and magnetism. are negligible, a very energetic field component fills space in radia ting lines. This \"dielectric\" field normally launches through space in a slow growth as charges are gathered. Here was a case where a DC generator provided the high voltage. This voltage charged an insulated hoop of copper, growing to its maximum value. If all values in the circuit were properly balanced, in the manner prescribed by Tesla, a sudden charge collapse would then occur. This collapse was necessarily very much shorter than the interval required to charge the hoop. The collapse comes when the magn etic disrupter extinguishes the arc. If the circuit is properly structured, no backrush alternations ever occur. This unidirectional succession of charge - discharge impulses causes a very strange field to expand outward, one, which vaguely resembles a “ stut tering ” or “ staccato ” electrostatic field. But these terms did not satisfactorily describe the conditions actually measured around the apparatus, a powerful radiant effect exceeding all expectable electrostatic values. Actual calculation of these discharge ratios proved impossible. Implementing the standard magneto - inductive transformer rule, Tesla was unable to account for the enormous voltage multiplication effect. Conventional relationships failing, Tesla hypothesized that the effect was due entirely to radiant transformation rules, obviously requiring empirical determination. Subsequent measurements of discharge lengths and helix attributes provided the necessary new mathematical relationship. He had discovered a new induction law, one where radiant shoc kwaves actually auto - intensified when encountering segmented objects. The segmentation was the key to releasing the action. Radiant shockwaves encountered a helix and \"flashed over\" the outer skin, from end to end. This shockwave did not pass through the w indings of the coil at all, treating the coil surface as an aerodynamic plane. A consistent increase in electrical pressure was measured along the coil surface. Indeed, Tesla stated that voltages could often be increased at an amazing 10,000 volts per inch of axial coil surface. This meant that a 24 - inch coil could absorb radiant"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"24 2 shockwaves, which initially measured 10,000 volts, with a subsequent maximum rise to 240,000 volts! Such transformations of voltage were unheard with apparatus of this volume and simplicity. Tesla further discovered that the output voltages were mathematically related to the resistance of turns in the helix. High resistance meant higher voltage maxima. He began referring to his disrupter line as his sp ecial \"primary', and to the helical coil placed within the shockzone, as his special \"secondary\". But he never intended anyone to equate these terms with those referring to magneto - electric transformers. This discovery was indeed completely different from magneto - induction. There was a real and measurable reason why he could make this outlandish statement. There was an attribute which completely baffled Tesla for a time. Tesla measured a zero current condition in these long copper secondary coils. He determ ined that the current, which should have appeared, was completely absent. Pure voltage was rising with each inch of coil surface. Tesla constantly referred to his \"electrostatic induction laws\", a principle which few comprehended. Tesla called the combined disrupter and secondary helix a \"Transformer\". Tesla Transformers are not electro - magnetic devices; they use radiant shockwaves, and produce pure voltage without current. Each transformer conducted a specific impulse duration with special force. Therefore each had to be \"tuned\" by adjusting the disrupter to that specific impulse duration. Adjustments of arc distance provided this control factor. Once each transformer was tuned to its own special response rate, impulses could flow smoothly through the syste m like gas flowing in a pipe. Finding that gas - dynamic analogies and applications indeed provided him with a consistent record of successful assessments in these regards, Tesla began considering whether or not the white flame discharges, so different from anything he had every seen, might not be a gaseous manifestation of electro - static force. There were certainly abundant experimental instances in which a purely gaseous nature, so unlike anything electrical, was being clearly made manifest. The manner, in which the radiant shockwave traveled over the wire coilings in white flimmering lamniar streams, brought a new revolution in thought. Voltage pulses traversed the secondary surface like a gas pulse under increasing constriction. Until reaching the free end of the coil, these gaseous pulses flowed over the copper surface rather than through it. Tesla referred to this specific manifestation as the \"skin effect\". In this the discharge greatly resembled the manner of gases in motion over surfaces. Furthermore, whenever a metal point was connected to the upper terminal of one of his Transformers, the stream became more directive. It behaved just like a stream of water in a pipe. When the white flimmering stream was directed at distant metal plates, it produced el ectronic charges. This charge production could be measured as amperage, \"current\", at the reception site. In transit however, no such amperage existed. Amperage appeared only when intercepted. Eric Dollard has stated that the space surrounding Tesla Impuls e Transformers so surges with these streams that the \"interception current\" can reach several hundred or even thousands of amperes. But of what was this mysterious stream composed? Tesla struggled with the doubt that these discharge phenomena might be ordi nary electricity behaving in extraordinary ways. But did electricity indeed have a smooth, soft, and flimmering nature? The electricity with which he was familiar was shocking, hot, burning, deadly, piercing, stinging, all the attributes of an irritant. Bu t this discharge phenomenon"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"   25 The Rosetta Stone was, whether cool or warm to the touch, soft and gentle. It would not kill. Even the manner, in which the pulse exploded as bright white discharges of greatly transformed voltage, s uggested the way in which gases behave when released from their confinements under pressure. These reflective meditations convinced Tesla that this effect was not purely electrical in nature. Closely examining the white flames, Tesla realized why there was no measurable \"electrical current\" at the crown of these activated coils. The normal heavy charge carriers, electrons, could not travel as quickly as the radiant pulse itself. Choked in the metallic lattice of the coil, electrons became immobile. No elect ron current moved through the coil at all. The radiant pulse, which moved over the coil surface, was therefore not electronic in nature. Additionally, Tesla discovered an amazing phenomenon, which removed all doubt concerning the true nature of energetic c arriers at work in his apparatus. Tesla arranged a very heavy U - shaped copper bus bar, connecting both legs directly to his disrupter primary. Across the legs of this U - shaped bus bar were placed several incandescent lamps. The arrangement was a very evid ent short circuit. The lamps were illuminated to a brilliant cold white light, while being shorted by a heavy copper shunt. Uncharacteristic of particulate current electricity, the bright but cold lamps revealed that another energetic current was indeed fl owing through the \"short - circuits\". Those who observed this experiment did not expect it to perform any function save the incineration of the disrupter circuit and possibly of the dynamo itself. Instead of this, witnesses beheld a marvel. The lamps lit to an uncommon brightness. In this simple demonstration, Tesla was illustrating but one of his many evidences. Electronic charges would prefer the least resistant circuit, rejecting the incandescent bulbs for the copper path. The current in this situation cho se to conform to a contradictory principle. Perhaps this was true because the currents were not electrical. Tesla repeatedly used this demonstration to evidence the \"fractionation\" of currents electronic, from currents neutral. A single question remained, the answer to which would provide him with the essential information needed to create a new technology. What so separated or \"fractionated\" the diverse mobile carriers in his transformer? It was the geometric configuration of the coil, which inadvertently separated each component. Electrons were blocked from flowing through the wire length, while the radiant pulse was released over the coil surface as a gaseous pulse. Electrons should have drifted through the wire but, during each impulse period, were block ed by the line resistance. Thus, the gaseous mobile carriers were released to flow outside the wire, a pulse that traveled along the outer coil surface from end to end. Here then was evidence that electrical discharges were indeed composed of several simul taneous mobile species. Tesla now comprehended why his first high frequency alternating currents never evidenced these powerful actions. It was the abruptness, the violence of the impulsive discharge, which gave free mobility to this unsuspected \"gaseous\" component. Impulses, unidirectional impulses, were the only means by which these potentials could be unlocked. Alternations were absolutely useless in this regard. Moreover, because alternations could not unleash the second gas - dynamic component, it remain ed an unusable and pitifully weak means. Tesla forever viewed his high frequency alternating devices as failed projects. This has great bearing on his highly critical views of Marconi and all the others like him who pursued high frequency alternating wave"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"26 Chapter 2 radio. Tesla began to study a topic, which has found more enemies and critics than any this century. Tesla, with greatest interest now, began researching \"the aether\". Tesla came to believe that dielectric fields were actually composed of aether streams. Theoretically then, one could derive limitless energy by trapping and conducting a naturally occurring dielectric field line. The problem was that no ordinarily accessible material could resist the aether enough to der ive any momentum from it. With a stream so rare as to pass through all known materials, the kinetic energy inherent in dielectric field lines would remain an elusive energy source. Tesla believed he may have found the secret to tapping this energy, but it would not require an ordinary kind of matter. Tesla viewed voltage as streams of aether under various states of pressure. Raising these stresses could produce enormous xther streams, where the observed voltage would then be extremely high and luminous. Thi s was the very condition which Tesla had come to believe had been established in his Transformers. In fact, Tesla repeatedly stated that his Transformers effected powerful movements in the aether. In one truly mystifying experiment indicative of these comp rehensions, Tesla describes the production of very rapid impulse trains with a subsequent production of \"cool misty white streamers extending a yard into space\". These were cool to the touch, and harmless. If electrical in nature, they would necessarily ha ve been several million volts in potentials. Their harmlessness is coupled with their sinuous nature, one completely unlike electrical currents. Indeed, to understand Tesla technology one must eliminate the notion that electrons are the \"working fluid\" in his radiant energy designs. With the lower coil end connected directly to the dynamo, high voltage aether stream were projected from the upper terminal. When describing each of his relevant patents in this new technology, Tesla forever spoke of \"light like rays\" and \"the natural medium\". The first term refers to the tightly constricted aether streams, which are propelled from his Transformers along infinitesimal ray lines, and the latter refers to the all - pervading aether atmosphere in which his technology operated. It is impossible to comprehend Teslian Technology apart from the controversial topic concerning the aether. Many analysts will reject the concept without first seeking out and discovering the proofs, which have been established by experimenters s uch as Eric Dollard. Tesla addressed the notion that aether streams were being pulled through his Transformers, drawn in at higher natural pressure, and accelerated in the sharp electrical discharge. As electrical systems, Tesla apparatus cannot completely be understood or explained. One must view Teslian Technology as a aether gas technology, one capable of being explained only through gas - dynamic analogues. It was now easy to understand how such projected rays, aether gas streams under high pressure, coul d penetrate metals and insulators alike. These powerful rays often could penetrate certain materials with inexplicable efficiency. Electricity did not perform these wonders. Tesla also now understood why these discharge streams produced their smoothly hiss ing sounds, visibly appearing like gas jets under high pressure. Aether gas under pressure. Tesla was completely mystified. He had successfully released the mystery current, normally suppressed and bound in electronic charge carriers. Unidirectional impuls ive discharges of high voltage and abrupt durations released them. What other potentials would aether gas technology release? The original cylindrical coils were quickly replaced with cone shaped coils."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"   27 The Rosetta Stone With t hese bizarre geometries, Tesla was able to focus the gas - dynamic component, which now rose up like a jet of hissing white light from the coil tip. Tesla recognized that these discharges, white spectacular and awe inspiring, actually represented lost power. A power broadcast station had to evenly disperse the energetic radiance in all directions. Flame - like discharges caused the available power to undulate in space. This would produce unpredictable power drops at great distances. Consumers would not receive a reliable and consistent stream of energy. If his Power Transformer was to operate with highest broadcast efficiency, these flame - like discharges necessarily had to be suppressed. But suppressing these excessive aether jets proved problematic. Tesla found that the white flimmering streams were absorbed in large capacity volumes, masses in which the streams were absorbed, filtered, and expelled. The use of copper spheres atop his Transformers forced the streams sufficiently apart to suppress the white flame . Power was now evenly dispersed throughout space as required. But a new problem appeared. The copper spheres, being impacted by the high voltage streams which they were forced to now conduct, expelled electronic components. These appeared along with the r adiance, producing truly dangerous conditions. The problem was stimulated by conduction, a case where the spherical copper ball was impacted throughout its volume. The white flimmering streams permeated the copper and expelled electrons. These contaminants concentrated their escape from the system as harmful, blue stinging dartlets. By comparison, the white flame - like discharge was a smooth and harmless glow. Comparing the two species, Tesla recognized the difference in charge carriers. Tesla was once nearl y killed when one such dartlet jumped three feet through the air and struck him directly over the heart. The copper spheres had to be removed and replaced by another dispersion component. Metals were apparently of no utility in this case, being natural res ervoirs of electrons. Tesla eventually suggested that metals manufactured electrons when impacted with these special flame - white currents, the carriers in the white flames becoming concentrated within the metallic lattice. He had already observed how the v ery air near these transformers could be rendered strangely self - luminous. This was a light like no high frequency coil ever could produce, a corona of white brilliance, which expanded to ever enlarging diameters. The light from Tesla Transformers continua lly expands. Tesla described the growing column of light which surrounds any elevated line which has been connected to his transformers. Unlike common high frequency alternations, Tesla radiant energy effects grow with time. Tesla recognized the reason for this temporal growth process. There were no reversals in the source discharges, therefore the radiant energy would never remove the work performed on any space or material so exposed. As with the unidirectional impulse discharges, the radiant electric eff ects were additive and accumulative. In this respect, Tesla observed energy magnifications, which seemed totally anomalous to ordinary engineering convention. It was easy to control the brilliance of a room by controlling the voltage in his transformers. T he light from this sort of illumination was curiously bright to human perception, but nearly impossible to photograph on film. Tesla found it necessary to make long time exposures of his discharges before the faintest sort of streamers could be made visibl e. This strange inability to register photographically was contrasted against the brilliance perceived in the eyes, one which required delicate control. Tesla also designed, built, and utilized large globe lamps, which"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"28 Chapter 2 required only a single external plate for receiving the radiant energies. However distantly placed from the radiant source, these lamps became brilliantly illuminated. Theirs was a brilliance approaching that of an arc lamp, and exceeding any of the conv entional Edison filament lamps by several factors. It was also easy for Tesla to control the heat of any space. By controlling both the voltage and impulse duration of energy in his Transformers, Tesla could heat up a room. Cool breezes could also be arran ged by appropriately setting the impulse duration. The key to producing all aetheric action was to secure a means for actually effecting aetheric deviations, the very thing now possessed by Tesla alone. Sir Oliver Lodge stated that the only means for “gett ing at the aether” was “an electrical means”, but not one member of the Royal Society had been able to achieve this feat with the rare exception of Sir William Crookes. The Tesla method used aether to modify aether! The secret was separating the contaminan ts from the aether current at the very source of generation, a feat that he had achieved in his Transformers and magnetic arc disrupters. Tesla used the violence of magnetically disrupted arc discharges to chaoticize electronic and aetheric carriers in met al conductors. Breaking the agglomerations that bind them together, each component was free to separate. This condition could not be achieved in arc discharges where currents were allowed to alternate. In such apparatus, the electronic carriers overwhelmed the release of aether and, while aether was present in the discharge, could never be separated from the composite current. The extraordinary efficiency of the magnetic arc disrupter in developing aetheric currents derived from several principles. Tesla sa w that electrical current was really a complex combination of aether and electrons. When electricity was applied to the disrupter, a primary fractioning process took place. Electrons were forcibly expelled from the gap by the strong magnetic influence. The aether streams, neutral in charge, remained flowing through the circuit however. The magnetic disrupter was his primary means for fractionating the electrons from the aether particles. Aether particles were extremely mobile, virtually massless when compar ed with electrons, and could therefore pass through matter with very little effort. Electrons could not “keep up” with either the velocity or the permeability of aetheric particles. According to this view, aether particles were infinitesimals, very much sm aller than electrons themselves. The aetheric carriers contained momentum. Their extreme velocity matched their nearly massless nature, the product of both becoming a sizable quantity. They moved with superluminal velocity, a result of their incompressible and massless nature. Whenever a directed radiant matter impulse begins from some point in space, an incompressible movement occurs instantly through space to all points along that path. Such movement occurs as a solid ray, an action defying modern conside rations of signal retardations in space. Incompressible raylines can move through any distance instantly. Should the path be 300,000 kilometers long, the impulse at the source end will reach that point as quickly as at all other points. This is superlumina l velocity, instantaneous propagation. Radiant matter behaved incompressibly. In effect, this stream of radiant matter, virtually massless and hydrodynamically incompressible, was a pure energy! Radiant Energy. Here was a distinct phenomenon, one that did not in fact manifest with other than impulse applications. Tesla alternately called these pure aetheric expulsions “radiant matter” and “radiant energy” Neutral in charge and infinitesimal in both mass and cross - section, Radiant Energy was unlike"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"   29 The Rosetta Stone any light seen since his work was concluded. If asked whether Radiant Energy can be compared with any existing physical item today, one would have to decline. We cannot draw parallels between Radiant Energy and the lig ht energies with which science has long been preoccupied. But if light - like at all, Radiant Energy is possessed of qualities unlike any light, which we have learned to generate. And this is precisely the problem. Tesla Technology is Impulse Technology. Wit hout the disruptive, unidirectional IMPULSE, there are no Radiant Energy effects.

These impulses must be generated through the explosive ag ency of a disruptive discharge, just as Tesla prescribed."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"30"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"   31 Chapter 3: Verifying Tesla's Secret Before I return to the discussion of Ed Gray's cold electric circuits, I would like to take a little time to present evidence in support of Vassilatos' thesis. I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to acquire a copy of Tesla's lecture, \"The Dissipation of Electricity,\" so I have been unable to refer to that document to verify Vassilatos' analysis. However, I felt that his point of view was such a different way o f looking at Tesla's work that I simply could not ask you, the reader, just to take it on faith that these are the facts. Therefore, I began researching the voluminous materials available on Tesla these days in an effort to find documentation to verify Vas silatos' thesis. In the large volume entitled Nikola Tesla: L ectures, Patents and A rticles, I believe I was able to find more than enough evidence in Tesla's own writings to support Vassilatos' analysis of his work. First, this quote is taken from Tesla' s article, \"The Problems of Increasing Human Energy\", that first appeared in The Century Illustrated Morrthly Magazine in June of 1900: Since I described these simple principles of telegraphy without wires, I have had frequent occasion to note that the ide ntical features and elements have been used in the evident belief that the signals are being transmitted to considerable distances by Hertzian radiations. This is only one of the many\" misapprehensions to which the investigations of the lamented physicist have given rise. About 33 years ago, Maxwell, following up on the suggestive experiment made by Faraday in 1845, evolved an ideally simple theory which intimately connected light, radiant heat, and electrical phenomena, interpreting them as being all due t o vibrations of a hypothetical fluid of inconceivable tenuity called the xther. No experimental verification was arrived at until Hertz, at the suggestion of Helmholtz, undertook a series of experiments to this effect. Hertz proceeded with extraordinary in genuity and insight, but devoted little energy to the perfection of this old fashioned apparatus. The consequence was that he failed to observe the important function which the air played in his experiments and which I subsequently discovered. Repeating hi s experiments and reaching different conclusions, I ventured to point out this oversight. The strength of the proofs brought forward by Hertz in support of Maxwell's theory resided in the correct estimate of the rates of vibration of the circuits he used. But I ascertained that he could not have obtained the rates he thought he was getting. The vibrations with identical apparatus he employed are, as a rule, much slower, this being due to the presence of air which produces a dampening effect upon a rapidly v ibrating electric circuit with high pressure as a fluid does upon a vibrating tuning fork. I have, however, discovered since that time, other causes of error, and I have long ago ceased to look upon his results as an experimental verification of the poetic al concepts of Maxwell. The work of the great German physicist has acted as an immense stimulus to contemporary electrical research, but it has likewise, in a measure, by its fascination paralyzed the scientific mind, and thus hampered independent inquiry. Every new phenomenon, which was discovered, was made to fit the theory, and so, very often the truth has been unconsciously distorted."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"32 Chapter 3 Figure 15 Tesla's Mechanical Circuit Controller"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"   33 Verifying Tesla's Secret Obviously, Tesla did not agree with the work of Helmholtz, Hertz, and Maxwell! For those readers who do not know who these gentlemen are, Hermann von Helmholtz laid the foundation for what is now known as the \"First Law of Thermodynamics\", which states that \"Energy can be changed from one form to another, but it is neither created nor destroyed.\" James Clerk - Maxwell's equations are the backbone of modern electromagnetic theory, and Heinrich Hertz' supposed verification of Maxwell's work was deemed so important that they named the measur ement of frequency after him. These esteemed gentlemen are pivotal personalities in the way electrical science is taught today. But, as we can see, Tesla dismissed them all as not being relevant to his experimental findings. In other words, if we follow th is path back into the aethers, we must be willing to leave behind the ideas and limitations defined by the \"First Law of Thermodynamics\" and Maxwell's equations. We now will peer beyond the boundaries of these tools, and move into a completely different re alm of study. In the closing remarks from the article called “ The Transmission of Electric Energy Without Wires, ” published in “ Th e Electrical World and Engineer ” in March of 1904, Tesla states: When the great truth accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed is fully recognized that this planet with all its appalling immensity is to electrical currents, virtually no more than a small metal ball, and by this fact many possibilities, each baffling imagination and of incalculable consequence, are rende red absolutely sure of accomplishment; when the first plan is inaugurated and it is shown that a telegraphic message, almost as secret and non - interferrable as a thought can be transmitted to any terrestrial distance, the sound of the human voice, with all of its intonations and inflections, faithfully and instantly reproduced at any other point of the globe, the energy of a waterfall made available for supplying light, heat or motive power, anywhere - on sea or land or high in the air - humanity will be li ke a ant heap stirred up with a stick: see the excitement coming! Here it sounds as if Tesla really has something astonishing, that he understands it, and that he is expecting it to be unlimited. It sounds like something way beyond anything that had ever b een done before. Even now, a hundred years later, we are only opening the door to some of these possibilities, particularly insofar as the transmission of the human voice is concerned. But we are certainly not there with regard to the availability of energ y everywhere on land or sea or air. Clearly, Tesla is referring to something that has not been brought into full, public use. What, then, was Tesla doing? What evidence do we have that Tesla was working on the kinds of systems that Mr. Vassilatos is talkin g about in his book? First, there is the evidence that Tesla was working on circuits with spark - gaps in an attempt to achieve higher and higher spark - gap discharge speeds Figure 15 represents one of Tesla's many patents called \"Electric Circuit Controller. \" This patent is very interesting because it consists of two electric motors, each turning in opposite directions with a spark - gap in - between the two moving members. It is evident that Tesla was clearly trying to achieve faster speeds than he could get jus t by rotating one member. This is a clear example of Tesla's work on a mechanical spark - gap controller in an attempt to increase speed, as Vassilatos suggested in his book. Figure 16 represents the only illustration in the Lectures, Patents, Articles book of a magnetically quenched spark - gap. However, it uses an electric magnet rather than a permanent magnet as referred to by Vassilatos. From this, it is clear that Tesla"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"34 Figure 16 Magnetically Quenched Spark Figure 17 Hot Air Quenched Spark"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"   35 Verifying Tesla's Secret Figure 18 Tesla's Electrical Transformer was working with magnetically quenched spark gaps. This illustrates one of his many experiments to \"blow - out\" or quench a spark discharge. This mechanism is particularly interesting, b ecause it was obviously designed for a DC spark. DC spark discharges do not start very easily. The presence of the spring - loaded handles on either side allow the spark mechanisms to be brought closer together to draw the initial spark by tapping one end or the other. Then they would spring back to their preset distances, enabling a DC spark discharge to begin under these very difficult conditions. Figure 17 is an illustration showing another spark - gap mechanism. In this one, Tesla is blowing hot air across a spark discharge path and, as indicated in the accompanying text, there is also a magnetic field present, Since Tesla was using both hot air and a magnetic field with a spark - gap in this apparatus, clearly he was looking at a wide variety of possibilities to get more controllable spark discharges, and, obviously, DC spark discharges with high voltage. The cover sheet for a patent called Electrical Transformer is shown in Figure 18. Tesla states that this is the invention that he plans to employ in construc ting improved coils and a manner of using them for transmission of energy over long distances. One of the illustrations from that patent (Figure 19) clearly shows that he has the construct that Vassilatos was talking about: just a few turns in the primary and a conical coil in the secondary. So all the structures that Vassilatos wrote about are Figure 20 is an illustration from the Tesla patent called the Art of Transmitting Electrical Energy Through the Natural Mediums. The diagram in Figure 21 is an enlargement of a section of this illustration showing the same basic structure of source \"B\" powering a 2 - turn primary with a spiral coil in the middle of it. This apparatus was designed for broadcasting energy to great distances, so it also inclu des connections to the ground and the sky. (E) is the connection to the earth, and (E) is what Tesla called an \"elevated capacitance\". This was the heart of the magnifying transmitter system that Tesla attempted to construct at Wardenclyffe, New York, in o rder to broadcast energy to all points on the planet. What is interesting about this is the source for energizing the system \"B\". When you look at this diagram, \"B\", on the left, looks like the symbol for a simple generator. However, the following excerpt from the patent text expands on the idea of exactly what source \"B\" is: In Figure 1, `A' designates a primary coil forming part of a transformer and consisting generally of a few turns of stout cable of inappreciable resistance, the ends of which are conne cted to the terminals of a source of power for electrical oscillations diagrammatically represented by B'.

In Figure 21, I refer to the image on the right side, as \"Tesla's Magnifying Transmitter Illustration as Described in the Patent Text.\" This shows the capacitor and the disruptive spark - gap (in this case a magnetically quenched gap) so he could control the impulse characteristics the way he wanted. Quoting from the text of this patent again, Tesla claims: I have found it practicable to produce in this manner an electrical movement t housands of times greater than the initial. So once again, he is talking about a tremendous gain in electrical movement. This is not just a gain in voltage like in ordinary transformers, but a gain in power. Just prior to that quote on the same page, Tesla states: These adjustments and relations being carefully completed and other constructive features indicated rigorously observed, the electrical movement produced in the secondary system by the inductive action of the primary, `A', will be enormously magni fied... Tesla obviously believed, and stated repeatedly, that this system was capable of producing more energy out than he was putting in. Today, that concept is referred to as \"Free Energy.\" For more evidence that Vassilatos' analysis is correct, I refer back to the Lectures, Patents, Articles book. On page L112, (Figure 22) you can see \"On the Apparatus and Method of Conversion.\" Illustrated here is a generator that can produce alternating currents into the circuits on the left and direct currents into th e circuits on the right. Figure 23 is a close up view of the direct current side. In the middle image, Tesla is taking direct current from the main generator and running it through another apparatus that, as the text tells us, raises the DC voltage even hi gher. The circuit then charges a capacitor and discharges it through a magnetically quenched spark gap to run light bulbs and other apparatus. This is direct evidence, in Tesla's published writings, that he was working with all of the components described by Vassilatos. True, he obscures them in a collection of other possibilities, but the essential elements are all present and explicitly defined. Add to this, the following astonishing statement by Tesla taken from \"The Problems of Increasing Human Energy\" in the June, 1900 issue of Century Magazine (page A145): Whatever electricity may be, it is a fact that it behaves like an incompressible fluid and the earth may be looked upon as an immense reservoir of electricity.... Considering that Nikola Tesla is the inventor of the polyphase electrical distribution system used all over the world today, it is astonishing that he states that he does not know what electricity is, but that it definitely acts like a fluid under pressure! This understanding of electricity is, of course, completely outside the accepted view. Tesla's statement that electricity behaves like an incompressible fluid only begs the question: What fluid is he referring to? Could this be one of Tesla's cryptic references to ether gas as Vassilatos s uggests? From the text of the same article, on page A148, are these other relevant statements: Finally, however, I had the satisfaction of accomplishing the task undertaken by the use of a new principle, the virtue of which is based on the marvelous proper ties of the electrical condenser. One of these is that it can discharge or"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"   39 Tesla's Magnifying Transmitter Illustration I Tesla's Magnifying Transmitter Illustration as Described in the Patent Text Figure 21 Tesla's Magnifying Transmitter as Descri bed in the Patent"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"40 Chapter 3 Figure 22 Illustration from a Tesla Lecture. February 1893 should possess, besides instructive, also entertaining features and as such, a simple experiment, such as the one cited, would not go very far towards the attain ment of the lecturer's aim. I must therefore choose another way of illustrating, more spectacular certainly, but perhaps also more instructive. Instead of the frictional machine and Leyden jar, I shall avail myself in these experiments, of an induction coi l of peculiar properties, which was described in detail by me in a lecture before the London Institution of Electrical Engineers, in Feb. 1892. This induction coil is capable of yielding currents of enormous potential differences, alternating with extreme rapidity. With this apparatus I shall endeavor to show you three distinct classes of effects, or phenomena, and it is my desire that each experiment, while serving for the purposes of illustration, should at the same time teach us some novel truth, or show us some novel aspect of this fascinating science. But before doing this, it seems proper and useful to dwell upon the apparatus employed, and method of obtaining the high potentials and high - frequency currents which are made use of in these experiments. O N THE APPARATUS AND METHOD OF CONVERSION. These high - frequency currents are obtained in a peculiar manner. The method employed was advanced by me about two years ago in an experimental lecture before the American 'Institute of Electrical Engineers. A numbe r of ways, as practiced in the laboratory, of obtaining these currents either from continuous or low frequency altemating currents, is diagrammatically indicated in Fig. 1, which will be later described in detail. The general plan is to charge condensers, from a direct or alternate - current source, preferably of high - tension, and to discharge them disruptively while observing wcll known conditions necessary to maintain the oscillations of the current.

Another of its properties, equally valuable, are that its discharge may vibrate at any rate desired up to many milli ons per second. I arranged such an instrument so as to be charged and discharged alternately in rapid succession through a coil with a few turns of stout wire forming the primary of a transformer of induction coil. Electrical effects of any desired charact er and of intensities undreamed of before are now easily producible by perfected apparatus of this kind, to which frequent reference has been made, and the essential parts of which are shown in Figure 6. For certain purposes, a strong inductive effect is r equired; for others the greatest possible suddenness; for others again, an exceptionally high rate of vibration or extreme pressure; while for certain other objects immense electrical movements are necessary. So, now we have what I believe are ample and su fficient references in Tesla's own words supportive of Vassilatos' main thesis that, indeed, Tesla was actively engaged in charging capacitors with high voltage DC sources; he was discharging them through magnetically quenched spark gaps; he was doing this at extremely high rates of vibration, even up to many millions of times per second, and finally, that this w as the method of operating his “ magnifying transmitter, ” the device that produced and captured what Tesla called “ Radiant Energy. ” The question is, in spite of all of this written evidence, do we have any direct proof that Tesla's Magnifying Transmitter produces a different form of electricity? To answer this question, I refer to Figure 24, a black and white version of the color image of the discharg e from Eric Dollard's Magnifying Transmitter shown on the front cover of this book. This photograph was taken by Alison Davidson in 1986 and was provided to me by Tom Brown in New Zealand. The wooden top of the coil is about 8 inches across. The voltage re presented by this discharge is anyone's guess, but certainly mast be approaching 400,000 volts. The other end of the coil is driving more than 4 amperes into the ground connection, measured on a radio frequency ammeter, and the entire system is drawing les s than 2000 watts from the wall. This image shows an imperfectly purified etheric discharg e, complete with “ blue dartlets ” , just as Tesla described. At this point I would like to add one more piece of eyewitness testimony concerning the nature of Tesla's r adiant energy and cold electricity. On the same day Alison Davidson's photograph was taken, Tom Brown and I conducted an astonishing experiment. I picked up an ordinary filament light bulb and held the outer screw base in my right hand. Then I asked Tom to step over and touch the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"   43 Verifying Tesla's Secret bottom connection of the light bulb with his finger. As soon as he did this, the light bulb filament lit to full brightness in our hands. I was about six feet away from the magnifying transmitter and To m was about eight feet away. I felt no unusual sensations at all, but I was quite startled. At that time I had no idea how really safe this form of energy is. To summarize, Tesla accidentally discovered an electrostatic \"super - charging\" effect while trying to verify Hertz' discovery of electro - magnetic waves. After hundreds of experiments, he learned how to control and maximize this phenomenon. This led him to the discovery that electricity is made up of different components, that can be separated from each other, and that a pure, gaseous etheric energy can be fractionated away from the flow of electrons in a circuit designed to produce short duration, unidirectional impulses. When all the conditions were right, this gaseous, etheric energy would manifest it self as a spatially distributed voltage that would radiate away from the electrical circuit as a \"light - like ray\" that could charge other surfaces within the field. From now on, I would like to refer to this phenomenon as \"The Electro - Radiant Event\" and su mmarize its characteristics as follows: • The Electro - Radiant Event is produced when a high - voltage, direct current is discharged across a spark - gap and interrupted abruptly before any reversals of current can occur. • The Electro - Radiant Event leaves wire s and other circuit components perpendicular to the flow of current. • The Electro - Radiant Event produces a spatially distributed voltage that can be thousands of times higher than the initial spark discharge voltage. • It propagates instantaneously as a l ongitudinal, electrostatic \"light - like ray\" that behaves similarly to an incompressible gas under pressure. • Electro - Radiant effects are solely characterized by impulse duration and voltage drop in the spark gap. • Electro - Radiant effects penetrate all ma terials and create \"electronic responses\" in metals like copper and silver. In this case, \"electronic responses\" means that an electrical charge will build up on copper surfaces exposed to Electro - Radiant emissions. • Electro - Radiant impulses shorter than 100 microseconds are completely safe to handle and will not cause shock or harm. • Electro - Radiant impulses shorter than 100 nanoseconds are cold and easily cause lighting effects in vacuum globes. The \"Electro - Radiant Event\" is essentially the \"gain mecha nism\" that Tesla discovered that is the basis of his Magnifying Transmitter. It is the foundation of his claim that he was able to create more energy in his output than it took to initiate it in his input. • This effect is greatly increased when the source of direct current is a charged capacitor."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"44 Summary of The Electro - Radiant Event 1.

To better understand what his circuit is and how it operates, Figure 26 shows Gr ay's \"schematic\" on the left, as it is presented in Patent # 4,595,975, and on the right, it shows what I refer to as the \"Simplified Gray Circuit `Schematic.\"' (I'm using the term \"schematic\" in quotes because this is not entirely a schematic diagram.) In order to better understand this circuit in its most fundamental form, I would like to eliminate a number of components, temporarily, that serve functions outside of its essential operation, as follows: • Components # 64 and # 66 (shown within the dotted - li ne box) indicate an alternate way of running the circuit from an AC supply. These parts can be eliminated without changing the circuit in any significant way because the circuit can be run from the batteries. • Components # 42, # 44, and # 46, which are th e safety overshoot mechanisms referred to earlier, can be eliminated because we learned in Chapter 1, reading from the patent text, that these parts are included simply to protect the circuit in case it generates too much energy. • Component # 26, which G ray calls a \"commutator,\" is part of the timing mechanism. However, the vacuum triode, # 28, is sufficient to give us the timing impulses for the discharge of our capacitor, so # 26 can be eliminated. • Component # 48 is a switching mechanism that allows t he operator to change which battery is powering the circuit and which battery the circuit is charging. This can be eliminated by simply indicating that battery 18 is running the circuit and battery 40 is receiving the charging impulses. When all of these c omponents are removed, we are left with the \"Simplified Gray Circuit `Schematic\"' as shown on the right side of the diagram. Figure 27 shows Tesla's Magnifying Transmitter Circuit next to Gray's Cold Electricity Circuit. I call this The Common Features of Tesla's Magnifying Transmitter and Gray's Cold Electricity Circuit. The important common features are as follows: • They both start off with a source of high voltage direct current. In Tesla's case, it's a high voltage direct current generator, Source \"B\". In Gray's case, it starts with a battery, # 18, whose output is chopped through a multi - vibrator, #20. The impulses coming from the multi - vibrator power the low voltage, primary winding on transformer #22. The high voltage secondary winding of # 22 is the n rectified with the full wave bridge, # 24. The output from # 24 is high voltage DC. But either way, both circuits begin with high voltage DC. • The next component in both circuits is"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"48 4 the capacitor. In Tesla's circuit it is \"C\"; In Grays, it is # 16 . Both circuits operate by having the capacitor charged repeatedly by the high voltage DC source. • The next component in both circuits is the spark gap. In Tesla's circuit it is represented as \"d - d\". In Gray's diagram it is # 62. For each circuit to work properly, the spark in the gap must be characterized by two features: first, there must be a means to insure that the discharge will occur in only one direction, and second, there must be a means to control the duration of the spark. In the case of Tesla's circuit, we have the continuous pressure from the high voltage generator to insure the unidirectional discharge of the capacitor, and a magnetic field across the spark gap to blow - out the current as soon as it appears. The duration of the spark can be det ermined by both the strength of the magnetic field across the gap and by the size (capacitance) of the capacitor. In the case of Gray, we know that he was using very large capacitors, so he wasn't discharging the entire capacitor at one time. But his circu it was performing two functions: the resistor, # 30, limited the current in the discharge, and the vacuum tube, # 28, could not only shut off the discharge at whatever pulse duration he desired, but it also insured that no reversals of current appeared in this section of the circuit. So, again, all the necessary features are present. • Next, both circuits have what I call the \"Preferred Location for the Electro Radiant Event.\" In Tesla's case, it is \"two turns of stout wire,\" (\"A\") as he calls it, which is the primary of his electrical transformer. But as we know from reading Mr. Vassilatos, this is not a magnetically inductive transformer. The magnetic coupling is very weak between the primary and the secondary coils. In fact this device runs on what Tesla refers to as his new \"electrostatic induction rules.\" In the case of Gray, the preferred location for the Electro Radiant Event is what he calls his \"conversion switching element tube,\" # 14. This component is clearly an electrostatic device, as we read ea rlier. It is specifically designed to have an explosive, electrostatic event radiate away from its central member. • The next common element is the \"Preferred Means to Intercept the Electro - Radiant Event.\" In Tesla's case, it's the secondary coil of his tr ansformer, \"F\"; this is the conical or spiral shaped coil that Vassilatos mentions and that we've already seen in his patents. In Gray's case, it's the charge - receiving grids, # 34, that collect the radiant voltage. It's important to see that in both of th ese circuits, there is no direct connection between the source of energy and the \"receiver element.\" Only the induced electro radiant charge appears on these output components. • The next element is the \"Connection to the Preferred Output.\" In Tesla's case , the output is the connection to the ground (E) and the elevated capacitance (E) that constitutes his World Broadcast System. In Gray' case, the output discharges from the \"charge receiving grids\" are directed to the inductive load, # 36. This element can represent either the jumping magnets or a transformer output that ran his cold electric circuit or the repulsive magnets in his motor. So again, each circuit has a preferred means to intercept the Electro - Radiant Event and a preferred method to connect it to the output. • And finally, Gray was able to reconvert some of this excess energy back into ordinary electricity, and recycle enough"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"   49 Decoding Gray's Patents Common Features of Tesla's Magnifying Transmitter and Gray's Cold Electricity Circuit Fi gure 27 Common Features of Tesla's Magnifying Transmitter and Gray's Cold Electricity Circuit"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"50 Figure 28 Gray's Circuit “ Schematic ”"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"   51 Decoding Gray's Patents of it to actually recharge his battery, as we read earlier. Tesla was not concerned with this recycling process, since his system was designed to be powered by a hydroelectric power plant. So it is clear from this analysis that Tesla's Magnifying Transmitter and Gray's Cold Electricity Circuits are, for all intents and purposes, the same circu it. They do the same things, in the same places, in slightly different ways, and they both claim to produce extremely high gains of a cold form of \"electrostatic\" energy in the output. Tesla's system was obviously much, much larger since he was planning to power up the whole world. Gray was only planning to power up your home or your car. But for all intents and purposes, these systems perform the same functions and release the same \"Electro - Radiant\" gain mechanism. Once again, Figure 28 shows Gray's circui t \"schematic\" from his \"Efficient Power Supply Suitable For Inductive Loads\" patent. I realized, after studying this diagram for a long time, that there were a number of basic problems with the way it was drawn. First of all, let's look at component # 42. As this is drawn (remember that this is a spark overshoot device) there is a line connecting all the way through the bottom half. If this were supposed to be an actual electrical connection, it would produce a short circuit, and would not allow capacitor # 16 to charge up. So, it can clearly be seen that this part of the drawing has problems. Next we will look at components # 26 and # 28 which are defined in the patent text as follows: Control of the conversion switching element tube is maintained by commut ator 26. A series of contacts mounted radially about a shaft or a solid state switching device sensitive to time or other variable may be used for this control element. A switching element tube type one - way energy path, 28, is introduced between the commut ator device and the conversion switching element tube to prevent high energy arcing at the commutator current path. If the commutator, # 26, were a solid state device, there would be no \"arcing\" to prevent. Therefore, the stated purpose of # 28 in the pate nt text is misleading. However, component # 28 is described as a \"one - way energy path.\" Gray is specifically saying that energy in this section of the circuit can only be allowed to move in one direction. This is the important condition to establish, becau se it is in strict compliance with the conditions Tesla set forth in order to create the \"Electro - Radiant\" event. There is also another glaring omission in connection to component # 28. The control grid in this triode device is not attached to anything, an d that, of course, is what could control the timing of the spark discharge. In the patent text, there is no mention of how component # 28 functions and no mention of how the grid is controlled. Recognizing that component # 28 had no means of being controll ed was an important realization for me. The next problems I found were in the inductive load, component # 36. The first is that # 36 is described as an inductor but is not illustrated by a coil symbol as we see with components # 22 and # 66. Second, there are also two odd arrows associated with this component. The patent text implies that these may actually be two coils that repel each other to produce mechanical work. With this in mind, the arrows may represent the idea of two members deflected away from e ach other in some way. This is not made clear in the patent text. Third, we don't see any real current path through this component, so we don't know where the discharge goes. And finally, fourth, the circuit comes to the second capacitor, # 38. In the pate nt text this component is described as being a part of the recharging mechanism. However,"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"52 Chapter 4 none of these component connections make any sense. For instance, if impulses coming from the inductor, # 36, start charging up capacitor # 38, there ar e no circuit connections shown that would allow it ever to be discharged. Therefore, because of these omissions, I came to view this section of the circuit more as a block diagram than as an actual schematic. I came to the conclusion that all that is reall y apparent is that the charge receiving grids are in relationship to the inductive load, which is in relationship to the receiving capacitor, which is in some relationship to the recharging of the battery. Therefore, this section is a block diagram, merely indicating that these components are in relationship to each other, rather than showing exactly how they are wired together. As we move towards a more complete understanding of what Gray's schematic diagram may actually look like, we will now turn our att ention to his \"conversion element switching tube\" (Figure 29). This, finally, is the heart of the matter, the component that Gray always referred to as the \"super secret means of generating and mixing static electricity.\" This is the element where the free energy is generated and collected. The conversion element switching tube is really three components in one. It consists of the resistor # 30, the spark gap (the space between # 32 and # 12), and the area surrounded by the charge - receiving grids (# 34a & # 34b). Even though it is not stated in the patent text, we do know that the spark - gap is rated at about 3,000 volts, based on statements made by Gray in the newspaper articles quoted in Chapter 1. The rear extension of what Gray calls his \"high voltage ano de\" (# 12) is the surface from which the Electro - Radiant event will be projected. This free energy blast will radiate away from # 12, perpendicular to the flow of current in the path of the spark discharge moving down that surface. The material composition of # 12 is represented as being relatively thick. It is not just a wire. But what are its characteristics? The patent doesn't describe them. We might hypothesize that this material is a bare metal with no insulation on it. It could possibly have a mirror finish, made of stainless steel or a non - magnetic material. A wide variety of options need to be tested here, but very possibly the element's diameter could be an important factor, as well as whether or not it is solid or hollow. These questions need to be explored and remain among the only unknowns. The concentric receiving grids (# 34a & # 34b) around # 12 are designed to intercept the electro - radiant event. As indicated before, the patent states, \"This element utilizes a low voltage anode, a high voltage anode, and one or more electrostatic or charge - receiving grids.\" This drawing clearly shows two charge - receiving grids. In the section from Gray's patent, which refers to this component, he says: The shape and spacing of the electro - static grids is also s usceptible to variations of application, voltage, current, and energy requirements. It is the contention of the inventor that by judicious mating of the elements of the conversion switching element tube and the proper selection of the components of the cir cuit elements of the system, the desired theoretical results may be achieved. It is the inventor's contention that this mating and selection process is well within the capabilities of intensive research and development technique. I'm sure this was his very nice way of saying, \"This is all I'm going to tell you, but you can probably figure it out if you know what you're doing.\" Then he says: The preferred embodiment of this invention merely assumes optimum utilization and optimum benefit from this invention when used with portable energy devices similar in principle to the wet cell or dry cell battery. This invention proposes to"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"   53 Decoding Gray's Patents Figure 29 Grays Conversion Tube Diagram"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"54 4 Figure 30 Edwin Gray and His # 6 Motor Prototype utiliz e the energy contained in an internally - generated, high - voltage electric spike to electrically energize an inductive load, this inductive load being then capable of converting the energy so supplied into a useful electrical or mechanical output. Here we ha ve clear statements by Gray that the conversion element switching tube is the source of the useful outputs. In fact, this component is what powered his magnet popping experiment; this is what ran his circuit, that ran the TV, radios, and light bulbs, and t his is the component that ran his motor. This is the element where the energy is both magnified and characterized as \"cold electricity.\" Henceforth, I will refer to this structure as an \"Electro - Radiant Transceiver\", because it is designed to both broadcas t and receive the \"Electro - Radiant Event.\" Having established these points, there are still a number of unknowns which need to be explored. For instance, there appears to be no provision, in these drawings or in the patent text, to determine whether or not We also don't know the physical size of this device, and we don't know the physical dimensions of the charge receiving grids, including their length or diameter. That is, until we examine the photographic evidence of Tom Valentine. there's a vacuum in this enclosure, or if it is filled with air or some other gas. The quotes from Gray in the NewsReal article reveal that he learned ho w to harness this effect by studying lightning. The article also states that he noticed lightning was stronger nearer the ground and that he assumed it had something to do with \"more air.\" So, it is possible that the inside of the tube is not a vacuum envi ronment. Although we know that the output \"cold electricity\" won't shock you, the capacitor discharge could, so the case around the component, # 50, might still be for safety reasons. Two safe assumptions are: 1) # 50 can be considered a mechanical means o f holding the components together, and 2) that there is probably air in this enclosure."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"   55 Decoding Gray's P atents Figure 31 Edwin Gray and Fritz Lens in 1973 In Figure 30 (and the color photograph shown on the back cover of the book), Ed Gray is standing before a meeting of his stockholders. In the enlargement of the inset image on the back cover, the “magi c component” can clearly be seen. A lot of information is revealed in this photograph about the layout of the device; in particular, the physical dimensions of the conversion element switching tubes, that I am now calling the Electro - Radiant Transceivers. There is a row of three conversion tubes and each one is being fed by the discharge of a single capacitor. Three very large capacitors can easily be seen. I had this image digitally scanned, and when I looked at the markings on this capacitor in extreme ma gnification, it read “2 micro - farads” and “4000 Volts DC.” So, where Gray's motor patent shows a bank of eighteen capacitors being charged and discharged in sequence to run the motor, that's not what he was really doing. The evidence from the circuit paten t and this photograph clearly shows that the motor coils were being powered from the output of the conversion tubes, and not directly from the capacitor discharges. The photograph shows only one wire coming out of each of the three conversion tubes going u p to the commutator, with just a single wire return. So, it is most likely that Gray is discharging the charge receiving grids to ground through his magnet coils. The inset enlargement clearly shows two charge receiving grids in the tube, about 1/4 of an i nch away from each other. Exactly how they are connected is still not certain. The patent suggests that each grid is wired out to the plug, # 60, and that there is one connection from there to the output Inductor. Figure 31 shows another unpublished photog raph taken by Tom Valentine in Ed Gray's laboratory in 1973, showing Ed Gray and Fritz Lens at their laboratory bench. The arrangement of parts shown in the foreground is the setup used to demonstrate the \"popping magnets.\" In the lower left portion of the photograph is what appears"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"56 4 Figure 32 Gray's Inductive Load to be an air core transformer wound on a 4 - inch diameter piece of PVC, resting on some wooden blocks (Figure 32). This circuit element is probably taking the discharge from the conversion element switching tube and inductively coupling it to a secondary winding. It is the secondary winding that powers the magnets, which are wired in series, making them fly away from each other. In order to create repulsive impulses that are timed perfectly to each other, Gray has this air core transformer powering the magnets simultaneously. He is using an air core transformer here in the first stage, because the impulse frequency is so high. A digitally - enhanced close - up image of this component shows the ce ntral winding as two layers of ten turns each of what looks like spark plug wire. This, then, is Gray's “inductive load.” This is how he is harnessing the energy from the charge receiving grids of the conversion element switching tube, enabling him to do r eal work. But possibly the best piece of evidence that supports this concept of the output, is that found in Tesla's US Patent # 685,958 titled \"Method of Utilizing Radiant Energy.\" Figure 33 shows one of the illustrations from this patent. Here we see pla te \"P\" being exposed to some source of Radiant Energy and then being discharged to ground through the primary winding of a transformer. So all of the evidence supports this idea of the output. At this point, we have enough evidence to theorize on what Edwi n Gray's cold electricity circuit schematic may actually be.

In the output section, I s how the two grids of the Electro - Radiant Transceiver, # 34, wired to each other. They, in turn are connected to the primary of the air core transformer, which is connected to the ground. The secondary of the air core transformer is a voltage step - down to p ower lights and other medium voltage appliances. This section of the circuit is also connected to another step - down transformer whose secondary would be rectified to charge another capacitor, # 38. As current pulses accumulate, this capacitor, # 38, will c harge to a voltage that is higher than battery # 18, and therefore will begin to charge this secondary battery. The spark overshoot mechanism, # 42, is shown as two separate high voltage spark gaps, one on the primary line used to dump any Electro - Radiant discharge that backs up in the primary circuit, and the other used to dump any excess voltage in the output circuit. Referring to the vacuum tube # 28, we know first of all, according to Vassilatos, that in order to create the non - shocking form of electric ity, Tesla said the spark duration must be limited to anything less than 100 microseconds. We also know from Dr. Chalfin's statement in the NewsReal article, that Gray used power for “only a small fraction of a millisecond.” The pulse timing I have suggest ed, at between 10 and 50 microseconds, represents between 1% and 5% of a millisecond. This certainly represents “a small fraction.” Secondly, the vacuum tube # 28 also acts like a super - fast diode to prevent any reversals in current. As stated before, cap acitor # 16 discharges through the Electro - Radiant Transceiver back to the positive of the battery. Normally, if a capacitor is discharged, the high voltage positive would be discharged back to the negative terminal. However, it is indicated that Gray disc harged his capacitor back to the positive of the battery. Tesla clearly showed that this is not necessary to create the Electro Radiant Event, but Gray must have felt it was important. The significance of this is not yet known, but it certainly must be rel ated to his idea of \"splitting the positive,\" a piece of jargon used in early reports about his technology. Clearly, it had nothing to do with \"recharging\" battery # 40. The voltage drop at the spark gap reduces the amount of energy that can be returned to this battery to near zero. So this cannot be the recharging mechanism. In all probability, by connecting back to the positive of the battery, Gray is characterizing the Electro Radiant Event in a more \"positive\" way. When I say \"positive\", I mean electro positive. So, now we have some notion of where Gray's terminology, \"splitting the positive\" comes from, and what its"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"58 Figure 34 Probable Schematic for Gray's Cold Electricity Circuit"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"   59 Decoding Gray's Patents significance might be. Also, Gray claims that he uses only a positive form of energy. Certainly what gets radiated out onto his charge receiving grids is a positive, electro - static charge. When that impulse is discharged to ground, he is only using the positive side of electricity. Therefore, eve rything Gray said makes sense. The photographic evidence in the image on the back cover strongly suggests that the charge receiving grids in Gray's conversion tubes are copper. As we have said before, Electro - Radiant effects create “electronic” responses i n certain metals. Gray must have figured out that he could create an electronic charge on his receiving grids if he intercepted the Electro - Radiant Event on copper. In Tesla's large radiant energy system, he learned to avoid using copper to prevent the ele ctronic contamination it created. But in Gray's smaller system, this was just what he needed. The more the Electro - Radiant energy interacts with copper again, the sooner it returns to a form of electricity that will actually charge the battery in a fairly normal way. This then is how Edwin Gray produced cold electricity. To summarize, Gray's cold electricity circuit runs like this: It starts with power out of the battery; he raises it to 3000 volts DC that he stores in a very large capacitor. He then discha rges impulses through a spark gap, clipped by a vacuum tube, such that the impulse duration is less than 50 microseconds. This staccato of impulses flows through the Electro - Radiant Transceiver, which creates a series of radiant, electrostatic fields of sp atially distributed voltage that is picked up by the charge - receiving grids. As soon as the Electro - Radiant Event ceases, these charged grids discharge to ground through the primary of the “inductive load.” The output recovery system is inductively couple d to this discharge primary with a voltage step - down to run light bulbs and other medium voltage appliances, as well as another step - down transformer to recharge the secondary battery. By switching the batteries back and forth periodically, Gray could k eep the system going indefinitely, and still produce a sizable output. At this point, there is only one final error to point out. In the patent text, Gray proposes a theory as to where the excess energy is coming from. He suggests that the gain in energy t hat appears on the receiving grids is the “equivalent” of the current from the low voltage anode (battery # 40) times the voltage from the high voltage anode (Capacitor # 16), combining in the spark discharge. He states: “Because the duration of the arc is very short, the instantaneous voltage, and instantaneous current may both be very high. The instantaneous peak apparent power is therefore, also very high.” This is clearly not true. I have tried dozens of methods to combine the voltage from one source wi th the current from another source in an attempt to create a power cross - product. It doesn't work. But the best evidence that Gray was not doing this he in these two points. First, such a scheme, if it were possible, would produce normal, HOT electricity. And second, Gray's conversion tube has a resistor between the spark - gap and the battery source, clearly blocking the availability of unlimited current. So, Gray's explanation of the “gain mechanism” cannot be true. He either put this in the patent because he didn't really understand the effect himself, or because he thought this explanation would get past the Patent examiners more easily. (I personally believe Gray understood how to create the effect, but he didn't know how to explain it.) Gray's statement that he only used 1% of the energy and that 99% went back into the battery is actually a meaningless attempt to explain this phenomenon in Thermodynamic terms. Actually, all of the energy in his primary circuit is lost. The capacitor # 16 discharges into t he spark - gap,"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"60 Chapter 4 where 99% of the work potential of the energy is lost in the voltage drop, not to mention th e fact that there is no output “ work device ” in the discharge path to take advantage of the impulse. So, 100% of the input energy is los t in terms of ordinary work conversion. It does do something else though. It produces a series of unidirectional disch arges that release a series of “ Electro - Radiant ” events that are discharged throug h the real output “ work device. ” This work output is 100 times greater than the energy lost to create it. If, at this point, there is still skepticism regarding the properties of Gray's circuit, the following may help to put all of this in perspective. Figure 35 shows a classic image of the enigmatic Testatika Machine, designed by Paul Baumann at the Methernitha Community in Linden, Switzerland. Mr. Baumann claims he learned how to build this device by studying lightning. It has a Wimshurst Machine as the high voltage, electro - static front end, which charges two capacitors or Leyden Jars. The high voltage from those capacitors goes down into the tops of the large cans, (the insides of which Mr. Baumann has never let anyone see) then, comes out the bottoms and meets in a spark gap. There has been endless speculati on regarding the c onstruction of these “ big cans, ” ranging from Uranium doped capacitors to strange arrangements of crystals and magnets. B ut, I submit to you that these “ big cans ” are Electro - Radiant Transceivers, and that they are not altogether differen t from Gray's Conversion Tube design. It is interesting to note that Mr. Baumann has placed one can on either side of the spark - gap, the first, probably producing a positive Electro - Radiant Event, and the second, producing a negative Electro - Radiant Event. You may recall that Vassilatos reported that Tesla said, depending on the location of the spark - gap, he could either project a charge or deplete a charge from a surface. So this is what a fully balanced system might look like, where the output pulses actu ally resolve the charge from an Electro - Radiant positive surface to an Electro - Radiant negative surface, instead of just from one grid to ground, like in Gray's system. Figure 36 clearly shows that this little Wimshurst Machine has no trouble at all creati ng big lighting effects. The claim in this image is 1,000 watts of light. The gain here must be close to 1000 to 1, not to mention the fact that the machine is turning itself. All the evidence supports the conclusion that Edwin Gray's “ Cold Electricity ” ci rcuit ru ns on Radiant Energy, and is a “ close cousin ” of devices developed by Dr. Nikola Tesla and Dr. Thomas Henry Moray. This also places it within a larger group of technologies that effectively tap the Ether for usable work. It is the only explanation that fits all of the evidence. In order to understand these Etheric technologies better, the researcher must study only those teachings that contribute to these vitalistic traditions. The model of the Ether that I have found to be the most accurate and use ful, is that set of ideas put forward by Dr. Rudolf Steiner. (The best source book to study Steiner's Ether model is Etheric Formative Forces in Cosmos, Earth and Man by Dr. Guenther Wachsmuth.) In this model, there are four primary octaves of the Ether. T hese are the Light Ether, the Warmth Ether, the Chemical Ether, and the integrated synthesis of these first three, called the Life Ether. St einer describes electricity as “ an unnatural combination of Warmth Ether and Light Ether. ” The term “ unnatural ” used here simply means, not found in nature. While these terms are slightly different, you may be able to see the parallels between this idea and the conclusions that Tesla was arriving at. The Light Ether is related to voltage, capacitance"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"   61 Decoding Gray's Patents Figure 35 Paul Baumann's Testatika Machine Figure 36 Testatika Machine Lighting a Light Bulb"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"62 Chapter 4 and the dielectric forces in nature, where as the Warmth Ether is related to current, resistance, and the magnetic forces in nature. Lo ngitudinal rays of Light Ether propagate instantaneously to any distance, even to inter - stellar and inter - galactic distances. This medium is cool, and not wholly responsive to what is generally referred to as electrical resistance. This means that even Ohm 's Law is useless for accurately determining circuit behaviors when this medium is present. More importantly, however, this relates to the great quest for the so - called “room temperature super - conductor.” It's possible that looking for the lowest resistanc e conductor may be the wrong goal. A purified stream of Light Ether is the true “room temperature super - conductee.” This medium is best “conducted” by pure carbon, according to Tesla, but it can also be \"reflected\" down a wide variety of mirror finish, sil ver metals, and transparent plastic polymers. Electricity is not a monolithic event, and it is definitely not simply the movement of electrons. Tesla demonstrated that electricity can be split into its Warmth Ether and Light Ether fractions. When this happ ens, the Light Ether speeds off at right angles, leaving the Warmth Ether behind, and entrains a huge volume of energy from the environment. It is imperative for modern day researchers to understand that the Laws of Thermodynamics and Maxwell's equations d o not pertain to Etheric technologies, and therefore do not define the total set of possible realities that can be investigated in electrical science. Besides Tesla, Gray, and Baumann, there are many other inventors who also discovered how to tap the Ether and make it do useful work. Among these are: John W. Keely in 1872, Nathan B. Stubblefield in 1880, Thomas Henry Moray in 1926, Viktor Schauberger in the 1920's, Dr. Wilhelm Reich in 1940, and dozens of others in the last 50 years. Most notably are Trevor Constable, and Dr. Robert Adams, of New Zealand. In light of this, there is ample evidence to suggest that God has been trying to give the peoples of this world low cost, clean energy, in the form of Etheric technology for over 120 years.

Many engineers and in ventors, working in the alternative energy field, still mistakenly believe that the “Laws of Thermodynamics” are univer sally true. For them, the “free energy” machine can only be a clever scientific slight of hand where the machine be comes “outlaw”, breaking some fundamental universe law. For progress to be made in this field, the l imitations and errors inherent in the “Laws of Thermodynamics” must be exposed . Only then will people realize that scien tific experimentation is the only reliable tool for revealing the behavior of physi cal reality. In order to bring this about, it will be helpful to quickly review some of the pivotal historical events which helped shape the modem scientific era with regards to ther modynamics. Before the year 1800, perpetual motion machines were considered possible and heat was not regarded as a form of energy. Both of these long standing assump tions, dating back thousands of years, were effectively toppled by the ideas of Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 when he postulated that since no one had ever been able to build a working perpetual motion machine, th at just probably, it was not possible. In order to deny the possibility of perpetual motion and hold the argument together, he had to assume that energy in the system was being conserved. It had long been ob served that mechanical devices could not transfe r energy perfectly. There was always some friction in the working parts. Friction was not only known to impede the transfer of energy in the machine, but it was known to produce heat. In order to simultaneously explain the work loss and the heat gain, so & FREE ENERGY by Peter A. Lindemann that conservation could be satisfied, Helmholtz postulated that heat was a form of energy consisting of a small, random motion in the molecules of matter. He went on to speculate that the loss of work in the ma chine as large scale motion was still present as heat in the small scale motion of the molecules in the material the machine was made o£ He suggested from this that both the heat and work must be considered energy, and that it was the total that was conserved, rat her than the heat or work separately. By 1850, Rudolf Clausius was able to synthesize the work of Helmholtz, James Joule, Sadi Camot and others to express a generalized statement that has become known as the “First Law of Thermodynam ics.” It states that “ energy can be changed from one form to another, but it is neither created nor destroyed.” By the time this thought became universally believed, it had totally transformed the intellectual land scape of mechanics, physics and energy dynamics. This was a cle an break from the set of thoughts and assumptions that had come forward from antiquity. A new era in science had begun. In understanding these historical devel opments, it is important to realize that besides the new theoretical explanation about the natur e of heat, all of the other data that led to the new theoretical generalizations was derived experimentally. This can be illus - trated by an observation made by Sadi Camot in his extensive work regarding the behavior of heat in machines. He states that \"in all cases in which work is produced by the agency of heat, a quantity of heat is consumed that is proportional to the work done; and conversely, by the expenditure of an equal quantity of work, an equal quantity of heat is produced.' This statement by Carn ot was based on hundreds of experi mental measurements. Aftersuch convincing experimentation, it was not unreasonable for Clausius to conclude that heat could be converted into mechanical work It was, however, a theoretical leap of logic to con clude that energy, in general, could be changed from one form to another. Before we go on, it is important, for our purposes, to be reminded that this new idea expressed as the \"First Law of Thermody namics\" consists of a number of overlapping ideas and assumptions t hat can be expressed as follows: 1) Perpetual motion machines are impos sible 2) The nature of heat is reduced to the random motions of molecular matter 3) Energy can be changed from one form Borderlands - 6 - Third Quarter 1994"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" Researcher s in the “free energy” field should not concern themselves with the outmoded ideas presented as the so - called \"Laws of Thermodynamics\".

It is the intellectual overlay of Hehnholtz and Clausius, on this experimental work, where the prob lems are introduced. The theory of conversion and the ideas about th e nature of heat will be taken up again later in this article, after more ground work has been laid. The “Second Law of Ther - modynamics” evolved out of further studies of the behavior of heat in closed systems. Re - markably, there is no one statement that i s universally recognized as the definitive expression of this so called Law.\" Among the more popu lar statements which reflect the general understanding of the \"Second Law of Thermody - namics\" are the following. \"In a closed system, entropy does not decreas e', \" The state of order in a closed system does not spontaneously increase without the applica - tion of work\", \"Among all the allowed states of a system with given values of energy, number of particles and constraints, one and only one is a stable equilibr ium state\", and It is impossible to construct a device that operates in a cycle and produces no other effect than the production of work and exchange of heat with a single reservoir.\" For those who can fathom the language, these statements clearly do not a ll express the same idea. Some have brad ramifica tions while others are more narrowly defined. All of these statements grew out of the idea, expressed fairly well as the last statement in the series, that a perpetual motion machine could not be made that operated on the a work/heat exchange when quantity of heat at the start After that amount of heat was converted to work and ture ambient temperature outside, n o further This is not only reasonable, but it is backed up by thousands of experiments. narrowly defined as a statement that reflects upon the behavior of heat in author has no problem with agreeing completely. Problems arise, however, with some of he more generalized interpretations of dosed system does not spontaneously increase without the application of to univer - define our terms. We must understand what is meant by the \"state of order\" in a boundaries of the \"closure\" of that system. In the first ca system is generally regarded as the temperature. Understanding this, we can rephrase this statement to say, that in a thermally not increase unless work or energy is added to the syst clearly defining our terms, and limiting the discussion to heat and work, we have a ment backed up by mountains of experimental data. If, a generalized \"quan tity of energ further define the \"dosed system\" as the Universe, we are led to believe that under possible to create a condition where the spon taneously. This is not true! While it should be underst ood that electri cal equipment and heat generally do of the planet does not. The Etheric Energy Field behaves in direct opposition to the he \"Second Law of Thermodynamics\" and experimental data. One of the best documented examples of this is the the \"orgone accu mulator', invented by Dr. Wilhelm Reich in 1940. He enclosure made of alternating layers of organic and inorganic density of the Etheric Energy Field to be concentrated in the local area, without the ap work. This new and higher energy concent tion is then reflected as a spontaneous rise ture. This situation does not break the \"Second because we admit that new energy is en It does break the \"Second Law\" in the gen e nergy is entering without the appli cation of designed as an attempt to shield and isolate this energy from its presence in the how ever, that he was not able to isolate y effects inside the accumulator be penetrated the walls of the enclosure.

It is when it is incorrectly assumed that all forms of energy behave this way and that enclosure of the system is possible at all levels, that grossly false con - clusions can be drawn from what started out as experimentally derived ob servations. The scientific community - at - large obviates these problems simply by denying the existence of the Etheric Energy Field because it doesn't fit within their intellectual model Unfortu nately for them, the mounting experimental evidence is making t his increasingly hard to do. Certainly, the best evidence to date of the existence of the Etheric Energy Field and its capability of being drawn to high concentrations without the application of work is demonstrated by the Etheric Weather Engineering techn iques developed by Trevor James Constable and his Atmos Engineering group. As a member of this group, I have personally seen how simple Etheric Energy projectors, that do no work in the classical sense, can cause the etheric potentials in the atmosphere t o rise to such high concentrations that millions of gallons of water will precipitate from the air for hours at a time. When these Etheric Energy projectors are motorized, they draw a few hundred watts of electric energy. If the rain produced is dropped be hind a dam and then released through a hydroelectric turbine, the electri cal energy gain in the system can be enormous, on the order of 100,000 to 1. This method of creating \"free energy\" is a prac tical reality today. While I know of no community using t his method for supplying its energy needs, it is eminently practicable. This example is theoretical in the sense that it has never been done, but it is a good model of other \"free energy\" systems under development around the world today. Because the input to motorize the Etheric Energy projectors is electric and the output from the hydroelectric generators is electric, many people might mistake this for a so - called \"over - unity' system There is nothing \"over - unity\" about this situation. Each and every compon ent of the machinery used in this system has operational and frictional losses. The energy tapped by the system is the atmospheric ether and all of the energy gain in the system occurs outside of the equipment The fact that a small electric input yields a huge electric output does not mean the system is operating \"over - unity.' The problem with the `over - unity' con - cept goes back to the \"First Law of Thermodynamics\" and its inherent idea about the ability to convert one form of energy into another. This assu mption in - cludes the idea that these various conversions are accomplished at known and accepted rates of exchange. The idea of efficiency of conversion requires that the various rates of exchange are fixed and ad as an upper limit for the calculation of a ratio that approaches one (10096) where the nu - merator of this fraction is the \"output' and the denominator is the \"input.\" Since it is generally agreed that every machine experi - ences so - called losses, the idea that this ratio could be greater than one is , of course, ridiculous. This, coupled with the assump - tion in the \"Second Law' that all energy systems are dosed, (meaning that no new energy can enter the system in - between the \"input\" and the \"output\") makes the idea of an \"over - unity' system even more impos sible than a mere perpetual motion machine. The line of logic embodied in the \"Laws of Thermodynamics\" is flawless. The problem doesn't exist in the logic, but it does illustrate that logic alone is not enough to reveal the truth. The problem exists in certain interpre - tations of these \"Laws.\" Let's go back and look at the \"First Law' again in light of our \"over - unity\" discussion. \"Energy can be changed from one form to another, but it is neither created nor destroyed.\" This seems simple enough to und erstand. Underneath the surface, however, there is an assumption that this also means that energy will not spontaneously appear or disappear from the system. This is also a necessary condition if conservation of energy is to be satisfied LOCALLY as well as UNIVERSALLY. This discussion becomes relevant, for instance, in describing the operation of the rotating magnet generator, the so called N - machine or Space Power Generator (SPG). Most of the important work in this field has been done by Bruce DePalma and P aramahams a Tewari. The following is a brief summary. The rotation of the magnet sets up two force fields that act at right angles to each other. These two force fields are the racially distributed inertial frame of space (centrifugal force) and the inters ecting axi ally distributed magnetic field of the rotating magnet The area of magnetized, polarized, inertial space appears to open up a region through which new energy can enter the system. When careful measurements are taken of current flows in the gener ator and in the external circuit, evidence suggests that electric charges are appearing at the periphery of the generator and disappearing at the center of the generator that do not actually pass through the generator. This experimental finding may explain why this configuration of electric generator experi - ences less mechanical drag than standard generator designs for each unit of electrical output produced. While energy is probably not being created or destroyed in the univer sal context, it is apparently appearing and disappearing from the machine during op eration in the local space. This extra energy can be used to produce useful work in external circuits. Tewari has shown that twice as much hydrogen can be generated from an electrolysis cell run from t he output of a SPG than if the cell is run directly. It is impossible to rationalize the behavior of this style of electric generator with the ideas of simple conversion and local conserva tion as they are postulated in the \"First Law of Thermodynamics.\" I n a standard generator, if all losses are ignored for the moment, conventional theory says if 550 Ft Lbs of work are applied to the input shaft in one second, 746 Watts will be delivered at the output If I blindly believe that the generator simply has the mysterious ability to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy, l don't ask the follow ing questions: what is the mechanism of this conversion?, where does the torque go?, and where does the electrical energy come from? The apparent observation that the generated current produces a motoring ef fect that opposes the input torque should not be interpreted as a vindication of the conser vation rule, but as an admission that this is an inefficient way to generate electricity. The Space Power Generat or experiences far less drag per unit of electrical output than a standard generator. This opens up a much larger discussion about the validity of the conversion idea all together. Are there actual and universal equivalents between the various forms of hea t, mechanical work, and electricity? At this point, all we know for sure are the various measurements that have been taken from the devices that demonstrate these energy translations. For instance, in 1845, James joule found that if he placed a small paddl e wheel in a bucket of water, he had to Borderlands - 8 - Third Quarter 1994"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" “Over - unity” is an oxymoron that should be removed from the vocabulary of the alterna tive science, community. apply 772.5 foot - pounds of mechanical work to spin the paddle wheel t o raise the tem perature of one pound of water, one degree Fahrenheit. This has led to very careful calculations that now set this \"universal conversion' between mechanical work and heat at 778.26 FT - Lbs = 1 BTU. For paddle wheels in water, this is no doub t true. But what happens if paddle wheels are not used? Is there another method that does not use paddle wheels in water to convert rue chanical work to heat that does the job better, with less expenditure of work for the same heat gained? The answer is ye s. In fact, there are numerous patents on record to accomplish this. One uses rotating parallel disks, not unlike the design of Tesla's tur bine, to heat water with less than half the mechanical expenditure. Once again, we have entered a new scientific era where the exact equivalence between mechanical work as foot - pounds, electrical work as watt - hours, and heat work as BTU's is not known! A wide variety of physical experiments have demonstrated a broad range of differing energy translation effects. The int ellectual edifice of Clausius' conversion idea is crumbling; and no one should allow their thinking to be con strained by it any longer. The results of physical experiments have all but disproved it. The \"First Law of Thermodynamics\" should be seen only as an outmoded, intel lectual MODEL that is not supported by all of the experimental data. Likewise, the idea of \"over - unity\" should be abandoned by those working on 'free energy\" systems as it is an intellectual contradiction based both on the belief in con version and the ability to circumvent it 'Over - unity\" is an oxymo ron that should be removed from the vocabulary of the alternative science com munity - This brings me back to the other problem presented earlier, namely, the nature of heat itself. Is heat, a s Hermann Yon Helmholtz suggests, simply the random motion of molecular matter, or is it something com pletely different, whose presence causes molecular matter to exhibit random mo tion?. This is a very long and involved exploration that has already been handled masterfully by Rudolf Steiner in March of 1920 and published as his Warmth Course . I will s ummariz e some of these ideas briefly. The ancient's believed that there were four 'elements\" that all physical reality was composed o£ These were Earth, Wate r, Air and Fire. In modern language, we can restate this as follows. There are four \"states\" that all matter appears as. These are solid, liquid, gas and heat. From an etheric science point of view, heat is the fourth state of matter and the transition sta te between matter and ether. Here is why. The only difference between the appearance of ice, water, or steam, for example, is its tempera ture or internal heat condition. Heat is absolutely fundamental in all considerations regarding matter because a chang e in heat is the only element required to bang about a change of state from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. In solid matter, the \"atoms\" are very close together and they bind each other in a way that allows them to hold their shape without being in a container. Heat can be added to the solid and its tempera ture will rise, correspondingly, until the melting point is reached At this point, adding more heat does not raise its tempera ture, but rather causes the material to change state as the solid mel ts into a liquid. Once all of the material is liquefied, adding more heat once again causes the temperature to rise. In liquid matter, the `atoms\" are less close together and they bind each other in a way that allows the liquid to take the shape of whateve r open topped container it is put in. As more heat is added to the liquid, the \"atoms\" move farther apart until the boiling point is reached. At this point, once again, adding more heat does not raise its tempera - ture, butrather causes the material to cha nge state as the liquid boils into a gas. Once all of the material is gaseous, adding more heat once again causes the temperature to rise. In gaseous matter, the \"atoms\" are so far apart that they will hold no shape at all and can only be contained by a co mplete enclosure. As more heat is added to the gas, the \"atoms\" become so dispersed that eventu - ally, all thatis left is the heat_ The relationships between heat, temperature, matter and state are quite complex and cannot easily be reduced to simple explan ations. Steiner's explorations of these relationships go into great detail, forming a seamless line of logic, backed up by a great deal of experimental data. Anyone interested in the nature of heat should study Rudolf Steiner's Warmth Cours e. While this ma y make no sense to people trained in mechanistic thought processes, it is much closer to the truth about heat than the ideas of Helmholtz, with which Steiner was completely familiar. Helmholtz's idea that the nature of heat can be fully described by the ra ndom motions of molecular matter is far too simplistic. It ignores many of the well known behaviors of heat and matter as well as the existence of the Etheric Energy Field. It should be considered an \"interest - ing' historical attempt to describe heat that is not supported by all of the experimental data. For those who are not familiar with etheric science, it might be useful to review some of the characteristics of the Etheric EnergyField at this time. The Etheric Energy Field is made up of an extremely fin e, mass - free fluid. Its activity can be divided into four main levels. These different aspects of the Ether have been called: the Warmth Ether, the Light Ether, the Tone (or Chemical) Ether, and the Life Ether. The Etheric En ergy Field, as a whole, penetr ates all matter, flows around and through the planet in well defined ways, exhibits elastic characteristics, and spontaneously moves from low concen trations to high concentrations before discharging. Understanding all of these fac tors has made engineerin g the weather a practical reality today. Many other amazing technologies also become possiblewhen the ether is fully understood. Likewise, many aspects of today's science that are still con fusing eventually become clear. One area of the greatest confusion lies in Borderlands - 9 - Third Quarter 1994"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"       123 Two Articles by Dr. Peter Lindermann the field of electrical science. The entire study ofwhat has been called \"static electric ity' is just a confusing encounter with the Light Ether as it behaves under certain circumstances. When fully understood, so called \"static electricity\" will be seen to be neither static nor electricity. Normal electric ity always flows from high potential to low potential and usually requires metallic con ductor s to flow along. On the other hand, \"static electricity\" does not discharge in the same way, and readily moves and collects on both conductors and insulators. Because \"static electricity\" behaves more like ether than electricity, I am going coin a term for this form of energy when it is present in wires and circuits. I call it “ETHERICITY”, to distinguish it from electricity all together. In some ways, electricity behaves like electricity and in some ways it behaves differently. This has been the source of confusion. Up until now, most people have thought that there was only one kind of energy moving in electrical style circuits. This can now change. Electric appliances are designed to run on the discharge of electric potential from high to low, as in the dr aining of a battery to power a load. Prop - erly designed circuits employing ethericlty run the appliance on the charging phase, as the energy spontaneously moves from low potential to high. Once the behaviors of etheric ity are clearly understood, it will b e just as easy to run motors and lights from this source as we now do on electricity. In the 1940's, Dr. Wilhelm Reich demonstrated both lighting and motoring effects running on the Etheric Energy Field that he tapped using his \"orgone accumulators\" and sp ecial circuitry. Bit many other ways have been discovered to harness elecricity. The patent office has many designs of so - called \"electro static' motors on file that work quite well They all run on ethencity, including some powered by circuits set up betwe en the ground and a wire suspended high in the air. Many types of capacitors will spontaneously charge up on days with low relative humid ity. This, too, is the classic appearance of ethecricity. I have seen how an \"electrostatic\" generator failed to do an ything, one humid morning, until the moment that sunlight fell on the metallic surfaces. It then jumped to life. This was one of the most convincing demonstrations I have ever seen that \"static electricity\" (ethericity) is related to light (the Light Ether ). Here then are some of the known charac - teristics of elecricity that engineers and inventors should understand 1) Ethericity can be accumulated from the ground or the air at almost any location 2) It can be \"reflected' down wires (this is not conduction) 3) Flow s of electricity can be interrupted by diodes and Mosfet type devices 4) Its potential can be raised or lowered in air core transformers 5) It can be stored in capacitors 6) It will operate neon style lighting; when the potential is high enough 7) It can create fields of opposing forces in coils and motor windings \"Free energy' is here in the Etheric Energy Field. Etheric Energy can be accu - mulated without the expenditure of work, and then released in controlled ways to perform work, in properly engineered sys - tems. Un derstanding this fact presents engineers and inventors the most direct and dear path to follow. Systems that precipitate heat directly from the ether have already been demonstrated in Dr. Reich's accumu - lator. Placing one of these accumulators over a movin g body of water increases the precipitation of heat dramatically. This is a rich vane of truth waiting to reveal its secrets to the systematic researcher. Likewise, power circuits that - run on ethericity for lighting and motive power are waiting to be perfe cted. Researchers in the \"free energy\" field should not concern themselves with the ideas presented as the so - called \"Laws of Thermodynamics\". The \"First Law\", with its ideas of conversion and conservation, is essentially incorrect There is no way to conve rt mechanical energy into etheric en - ergy, actually make one into the other. This one example is enough to disprove the universal interpretation of the conversion idea all together. Beyond this, the energy forms that can be transmuted by the action o£ cert ain kinds of machines, apparently do so within a wide range of activity, depending on the geometry of the machine. This throws into question the idea of conservation, espe cially local conservation. These experimental findings render the \"First Law\" withou t any basis in fact The real universe does not behave in accordance with these ideas. In the narrow case, the \"Second Law' is really only a statement which describes the behavior of heat under certain circumstances. This much is basically true, as it is fo unded on experimental observation. In the general case, however, the \"Second Law' is an intellectual extrapolation that does not accu rately describe the behavior of physical reality under all circumstances. It embodies an erroneous concept of a mechanical ini - verse which mysteriously burst forth (Big Bang) as a fully wound spring that has been unwinding ever since (\"in a dosed system, entropy does not decrease\"). It is a lifeless, empty vision that ignores the Source of the energy it started with and dose s the minds of its adherents to the solutions at hand. Learning how to tap the non - thermody namic forces in nature is the hope of the future. A modem society needs light, heat, and motive power, all of which can be derived directly from the Etheric Energy Field without consuming limited physical resources owned by monopoly interests. In this society, theoretical science has been elevated to a very high level of pres - tige. Under this system of belief, the real needs of humanity have not been well served. Iti s time that these incorrect theories be carefully examin ed an d discarded, so that experimental science can once again take the leading role in defining the nature of physical reality. Only then will Etheric Science be free to offer its bounty of solu tions to a desperate and waiting world.

Lindemann In June of the year 1900, Nikola Tesla published an article in Century Magazine titled The Pr oblems of Increasing Human Energy. Never be fore or since has there been such a masterful and exhaustive discussion of how to extract useful energy from the environment In its original magazine for mat, this article is 31 pages in length. After discussing every known method for energy generation then in use, Tesla begins a discussion of \"a departure from known methods - possibility of a 'self - acting' engine - the ideal way of obtaining motive power\". Beginning on page 200, and continuing to page 204 of the original Century Magazine article, Tesla outlines his ideas. The following quotations are extracted from this section of the article. \"...a survey of the various ways of utilizing the energy of the medium convinced me, ..that to arrive at a practical solut ion, a radical departure from the methods then known had to be made. The windmill, the solar engine, the engine driven by terrestrial heat, had their limitations in the amount of power obtain - able. Some new way had to be discovered which would enable us to get more energy.\" \"..the problem was to discover some new method which would make it possible both to utilize more of the heat - energy of the medium and also to draw it away from the same at a more rapid rate.\" \"I was vainly endeavoring to form an idea of how this might be accomplished, when I read some statements from Carnot and Lord Kelvin which meant virtually that it is impossible for an inanimate mechanism or self - acting machine to cool a portion of the medium below the temperature of the surrounding, and operate by the heat extracted. These statements interested me intensely. Evidently, a living being could do this very thing, and since the experiences of my early life ... convinced me that a living being is only an automaton, or, otherwise stated, a ' self - acting engine,' I came to the conclusion that it was possible to construct a machine which would do the same.\" \"Suppose that an extremely low temperature could be main tained by some process in a given space; the surrounding medium would then be compe lled to give off heat, which could be converted into mechanical or other form of energy, and utilized. By realizing such a plan, we should be enabled to get at any point of the globe a continuous supply of energy, day and night.\" \"A closer investigation of the principles involved, and calcula tion, now showed that the result I aimed at could not be reached in a practical manner by ordinary machinery, as I had in the beginning expected. This led me, as a next step, to the study of a type of engine generally designated as `turbine,' which at first seemed to offer better chances for a realization of the idea.\" \"..my conclusions showed that if an engine of a peculiar kind could be brought to a high degree of perfection, the plan I had conceived was realizable, a nd I resolved to proceed with the development of such an engine, the primary object of which was to secure the greatest economy of transformation of heat into mechani cal energy.\" \"(In early 1895) Dr. Carl Linde announced the liquefaction of air by a self - cooling process, demonstrating that it was practicable to proceed with the cooling until liquefaction of air took place. This was the only experimental proof which I was still wanting that energy was obtainable from the medium in the manner contemplated by me.\" \"Much 01 \"3 task on which I have labored so long remains to be done.

Design a machine powered by the heat resident in the ambient air that produced an output of mechani cal energy and refrigeration simultaneously. He called it \"the ideal way of obtaining motive power\". Such a machine would be able to produce useful energy at any time of the day or night, at any location on the globe, drawing upon the vast heat reservoir o f the atmosphere. He worked for years toward this goal and absolutely convinced himself, by the power of his own nearly infallible logic, of its potential reality. To my knowledge, Testa never finished the work on this invention. But his pioneering efforts clearly conceived the idea, as well as outlined most of the engineering problems to be solved. It's remarkable to me, that with all of the attention given to Nikola Testa in the last few years, I have not heard any mention of this aspect of his work. Volu mes have been written on so - called \"free energy\" devices, wherein the would - be in - ventors are searching in vain for a ubiquitously present, inexhaustible source of energy from which their machines may draw. Imaginative theories have postulated \"tachy - ons\" , \"zero - points\", and \"magnetism\" as the source of choice from which to extract energy. And, while future work may prove that these sources can be made practical, it is still surpris ing that the most readily available, untapped source of energy from which to draw, atmospheric heat, has been all but neglected. The patent office is crammed with hundreds of \"permanent magnet motors\", none of which work, to my knowledge. Testa dismisses these ideas with a short stroke, \"We may even find ways of applying forces such as magnetism or gravity for driving machinery without using any other means. Such realizations, while highly improbable, are not impossible.\" While leaving the door open, Tesla considers this area of research worthy of only a brief mention. He then g oes on for four pages, discussing his efforts to tap the ambient temperature as a source of power. Tesla was a master thinker and inventor. His mind penetrated the ultimate solution to humanity's energy needs. Like a scientific Sherlock Holmes using the po wer of his own deduction, when all of the 'improbables' and \"impossibles\" were removed, what remained must be the solution. Atmospheric heat was the largest untapped reservoir of energy on the planet Tesla refused to over - looked the obvious. He was that ra re fish capable of contemplating the water he was swimming in. Few were able to follow his ideas. Even fewer were able to follow - up on his work When I first read this article from Century Magazine, I was fascinated by the section on the \"self - acting\" engin es. But Testa's idea of gaining energy by dumping heat into an inexhaustible \"cold spot\" seemed unrealizable. My mind could not penetrate the unknowns involved. Luckily, other minds were not so dull. To begin to get an understanding of Tesla's idea, let's fast look at the fundamentals of fluid dynamics. Follow along if you can. If a gaseous fluid (like air) is confined in a closed space, three properties of this gas become interdependent upon each other. These properties are: 1) Volume, how much space it oc cupies, 2) Temperature, how much heat it contains, and 3) Pressure, how much force it exerts on the walls of the container. For instance, if the container remains the same size and we increase the tempera - ture of the air inside, the pressure it exerts on t he walls also rises. Likewise, if the volume stays the same and we reduce the pressure, the temperature must also drop. Conversely, if we increase the volume, either the temperature or the pressure will go down (or both). From this we may see that temperat ure and pressure are directly related to each other, but are inversely related to the volume. This is how Dr. Carl Linde liquefied air by his \"self - cooling\" pro cess. By manipulating the pressure and volume of a quantity of gaseous air, he was able to liq uefy some of it by taking advantage of these principles. One hundred years ago, this was an amazing accomplishment. Now, these processes are used commercially every day. To illustrate, we need go no further than a useful novelty available in a mail order c atalog. Many com pressed gases are available today. One of them is carbon dioxide. For less than $30, you can buy a special nozzle that attaches to a canister of compressed carbon dioxide. When the gas is released through this nozzle, \"dry ice\" is formed. Room temperature compressed carbon dioxide, when allowed to expand rapidly under controlled conditions, refrigerates itself to form \"dry ice'. By this method, about 20% of the compressed gas can be liquefied, or in this case, solidified. This illustrates w hat Tesla refers to as the \"self - cooling\" process that allowed Dr. Carl Linde to liquefy air in 1895. Tesla immediately understood the implications. He states that his invention could be designed to run on liquid air, but that \"its temperature is unneces s arily low.\" All that was needed was a working fluid that changed from a gas to a liquid at a temperature below the ambient Dr. Linde's process required a mechanical energy input to compress the air. But Tesla knew that mechanical processes were reversible. The machine he envisioned used the methods discov ered by Dr. Linde, but ran them backwards. To understand how this can be done, we need go no further than our own medicine cabinet If room temperature isopropyl alcohol is rubbed on your Appendix III BORDE RLANDS Third Quarter 1995 7"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"       127 Two Articles by Dr. Peter Lindemann arm, it \"feels . cold\". It feels cold because it is evaporating. It is evaporating because of a change in \"vapor pressure\" between the closed bottle and the open air. This change of pressur e is \"forcing\" the evaporation to take place. But, for the alcohol to evaporate (change from a liquid to a gas), it needs heat Since no heat source is available, it must get the necessary heat from the immediate environment So, it extracts that heat from y our arm. That's why your arm feels cold (refrigeration). Believe it or not, Tesla saw an energy machine in all of this. The one part of the equation that is not so apparent here, is that the volume of space occupied by the evaporating alcohol is increasing dramatically. This increasing volume of gas could be confined to form a pressure that could drive an engine. Tesla saw it all, and knew what it meant He spent years trying to solve all of the engineering problems associated with it, so that a future socie ty could have all of its energy needs supplied by these processes. So, what does Tesla's \"self - acting\" engine really look like? In order to visualize this, it may be helpful first to review the workings of two different kinds of heat systems that operate o n \"two phase flu ids\"; the first is a steam en gine and the second is a heat pump. In Figure 1, water is boiled in the boiler to be come pressurized steam. This high temperature, high pres sure steam is then used to drive a turbine engine to convert the va por pressure into mechanical work. The low temperature, low pres sure steam coming out of the turbine is then allowed to cool further in the condenser, becoming liquid water again. The liquid water is then pumped back into the boiler, and the cycle begins again. In this example, we can easily see that the system takes in heat at the boiler and gives off heat at the condenser. Figure 2 is a diagram of a heat pump. Low temperature vapor enters the compressor and is compressed to a high pressure and temperatu re. This vapor is then condensed to a liquid in the condenser. Then, the pressurized liquid is throttled through a special nozzle to low pressure and temperature. Releasing the pressure allows some of the liquid to vaporize. This \"two phase fluid\", part li quid and part vapor, now enters the evaporator, in which the remaining liquid is boiled. The resultant low tempera - ture vapor then enters the compressor, completing the cycle. In this example, we can see that the system takes in heat at the evaporator and gives off heat at the condenser. There is a high degree of similarity between these two systems. Both have a location where heat is absorbed (boiler and evapora - tor). Both have a location where the pressure is released (turbine and throttle). Both have a l ocation where heat is released (condens ers). And both have a location where the working fluid is pressur ized to complete the cycle (pump and compressor). In the steam engine, heat energy is added to the system at the boiler and mechanical energy is remov ed from the system at the turbine. That amount of heat that was not successfully transformed to mechanical energy at the turbine, is then thrown away at the, condenser and represents a loss of efficiency. In the heat pump, mechanical energy is added to the system at the compressor and heat energy is removed from the system at the condenser. That amount of liquid that vaporizes at the throttle represents a loss of efficiency because no heat is absorbed from .the environment to create the vaporiza tion. The m ain difference between these two systems is that the steam engine runs on a working fluid (water) that changes phase from a liquid to a gas at 212' Fahrenheit, whereas the heat pump runs on a working fluid (freon) that changes phase from a liquid to a gas at - 50' Fahrenheit Tesla's \"self - acting\" engine was a unique hybrid between these two systems. Tesla knew that his system, if it was to work, had to be much more efficient than standard systems. In our steam engine example, for instance, if we could elimi nate the condenser, the sys - tem would be more efficient In our heat pump example, if we integrated the throttle into the evaporator so that all of the expansion happened there, the system would be more efficient. These are the .kinds of engineering proble ms Tesla was attempting to solve. By taking elements from both of these systems, we can begin to understand what Tesla had discovered. Figure 3 shows such a system. It runs on a low temperature phase change material, like freon. The first element acts lik e a combination of the pump and the compressor. Its job is to take the \"two phase fluid\", part liquid and part vapor, and compress it until it is 100% liquid. The next element of the system takes the place of the boiler. It is really a heat exchanger that allows the working fluid to absorb heat from the environment without boiling. On the outside, this element gets cold and produces refrigeration effects. On the inside, the working fluid is gaining in its stored heat potential. The next element of the syste m is the throttle or control valve. This component allows the pressurized, liquid material to experience a rapid pressure drop that promotes instant vaporization of some of the working fluid. Since no heat source is available here, the heat of vaporization must come from the stored heat in the working fluid itself. This rapidly expanding vapor/liquid combination is then harnessed by the next element of the system, the turbine. As Tesla said, this is \"an engine of a peculiar kind.\" It must be able to efficie ntly operate on the part vapor, part liquid material coming through it When the volumetric expansion is spent, the \"two phase fluid\" is then re - compressed to a liquid, and the cycle starts over. Tesla envisioned that his turbine would produce more mechanic al energy than the compressor required, so that the s y stem would produce a net gain of mechani cal energy.

Heat energy is absorbed from the ambient, mechanics energy is removed from the turbine and all of the remaining hea potential in the working fluid is recycled for the next go - round. The whole thing is an amazing idea, but will it work? Can the n ecessary efficiencies actually be attained? In the 1930's, an Austrian engineer named Rudolf Doczekal successfully built a steam engine that ran on a combination of water and benzene. To his amazement, it could run with or without the condenser in the syst em. Its efficiency was well above the calculated Carnot Cycle maximum. He was granted a Patent on this system in 1939 (NR. 155744). It took 39 years, and someone else to prove it, but Tesla was right; a high efficiency heat engine could be run without a co ndenser. But can all of the other efficiencies be attained? Is there a device that can efficiently compress the \"two phase fluid\" back to a liquid? The answer is yes. Today, the Copeland Scroll Compressor can perform this function. Is there a turbine that can run efficiently on the rapidly ex - panding \"two phase fluid?\" Again, the answer is yes. Im - pulse turbines with the pres sure nozzles built directly into the housing can perform this function, so that all of the fluid expansion occurs inside the engine. In fact, all of the other engineering problems have been solved. Today there are working models of machines that con vert the ambient temperature of the air into mechanical energy, while creating refrigeration as a by - product One hundred years after Tesla identified the \"ideal way of gaining motive power\", the gigantic reservoir of atmospheric heat has been successfully tapped. Real \"free energy\" has arrived on planet Earth. Obviously, the working details of these machines are complicated. The average read er will not have a thorough understanding of them without considerable study. Still, the basic principles upon which they operate have been outlined here with only minor oversimplification. As of June, 1995, there are two slightly different processes being pursued that give the same basic result The first is a machine designed by a German physicist, Dr. Bernhard Schaeffer, along with a Russian inventor, Albert Serogodski, building on the pioneering work of Doczekal. Their latest machine has been granted Ger man Patent # DE 42 44 016 A 1, and is capable of being embodied as a refrigerator that produces electricity rather than consumes it The other development is based on the work of Canadian engineer, George Wiseman, building more directly on Tesla's ideas. Wi seman has written three books that fully outline the principles of this amazing invention. His HEAT Technol ogy Series, Book 1, Book 2, and Book 3 are must reading for anyone interested in this subject In these books, turbine designs are explored along wit h complete mathematical models of the system.

Buy both books, as they cover different asp ects of the system. One hundred years ago, Nikola Tesla discovered the ultimate way to harness the energy of the sun by converting the ambient temperature of the air into mechanical energy. He outlined the entire method and even solved many of the difficul ties himself. But forces during his lifetime prevented him from completing this work. His \"self - acting\" engine is a true fuel - less power plant, capable of producing useful energy at any location on the planet, at any time of the day or night It has taken o ne hundred years for others to finally complete this work, but that day has now arrived. While I do not wish to minimize the irreplaceable and outstanding contri butions by Wiseman, Schaeffer, Doczekal and others, still, it is to Tesla that the future owes its thanks once again. When Tesla first con ceived of this invention, he started by deciding that the basic assumptions embod ied in the \"Second Law of Thermodynamics\" were not universally true and there fore could not act as an abso lute limiting case. T hese as - sumptions are built into our lives today by the idea that if I want the temperature of my environment to be either warmer or cooler than the ambient, I have to expend energy to do it Tesla was not afraid to question or even disagree with these ass ump tions. Even the stature and historic \"authority\" of Sadi Carnot and Lord Kelvin, whose work was the basis of the \"Laws of Thermody namics\", did not intimidate him. He was willing to rethink all of the fundamentals in the light of his own experiments an d insight, and draw his own conclusions. By doing so, he was able to conceive of an invention that has taken 100 years to create.
