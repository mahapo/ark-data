To many workers and thinkers in the domain of electricalinvention, the apparatus and devices that are familiar, appear cumbrous andwasteful, and subject to severe limitations. They believe that the principles ofcurrent generation must be changed, the area of current supply be enlarged, andthe appliances used by the consumer be at once cheapened and simplified. Thebrilliant successes of the past justify them in every expectancy of still moregenerous fruition.The present volume is a simple record of the pioneer work done in suchdepartments up to date, by Mr. Nikola Tesla, in whom the world has alreadyrecognized one of the foremost of modern electrical investigators and inventors.No attempt whatever has been made here to emphasize the importance of hisresearches and discoveries. Great ideas and real inventions win their own way,determining their own place by intrinsic merit. But with the conviction that Mr.Tesla is blazing a path that electrical development must follow for many yearsto come, the compiler has endeavored to bring together all that bears theimpress of Mr. Tesla’s genius, and is worthy of preservation. Aside from itsvalue as showing the scope of his inventions, this volume may be of service asindicating the range of his thought. There is intellectual profit in studyingthe push and play of a vigorous and original mind.Although the lively interest of the public in Mr. Tesla’s work is perhaps ofrecent growth, this volume covers the results of full ten years. It includes hislectures, miscellaneous articles and discussions, and makes note of all hisinventions thus far known, particularly those bearing on polyphase motors andthe effects obtained with currents of high potential and high frequency. It willbe seen that Mr. Tesla has ever pressed forward, barely pausing for an instantto work out in detail the utilizations that have at once been obvious to him ofthe new principles he has elucidated. Wherever possible his own language hasbeen employed.It may be added that this volume is issued with Mr. Tesla’s sanction andapproval, and that permission has been obtained for the re-publication in it ofsuch papers as have been read before various technical societies of this countryand Europe. Mr. Tesla has kindly favored the author by looking over the proofsheets of the sections embodying his latest researches. The work has alsoenjoyed the careful revision of the author’s friend and editorial associate, Mr.Joseph Wetzler, through whose hands all the proofs have passed.December 1893"},{"pageContent":"PART I [05_Contents.xhtml#r2]POLYPHASE CURRENTS [05_Contents.xhtml#r2]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER I [05_Contents.xhtml#r3]BIOGRAPHICAL AND INTRODUCTORY [05_Contents.xhtml#r3]As an introduction to the record contained in this volume of Mr. Tesla’sinvestigations and discoveries, a few words of a biographical nature will, it isdeemed, not be out of place, nor other than welcome.Nikola Tesla was born in 1857 at Smiljan, Lika, a borderland region ofAustro-Hungary, of the Serbian race, which has maintained against Turkey and allcomers so unceasing a struggle for freedom. His family is an old andrepresentative one among these Switzers of Eastern Europe, and his father was aneloquent clergyman in the Greek Church. An uncle is today Metropolitan inBosnia. His mother was a woman of inherited ingenuity, and delighted not only inskillful work of the ordinary household character, but in the construction ofsuch mechanical appliances as looms and churns and other machinery required in arural community. Nikola was educated at Gospich in the public school for fouryears, and then spent three years in the Real Schule. He was then sent toCarstatt, Croatia, where he continued his studies for three years in the HigherReal Schule. There for the first time he saw a steam locomotive. He graduated in1873, and, surviving an attack of cholera, devoted himself to experimentation,especially in electricity and magnetism. His father would have had him maintainthe family tradition by entering the Church, but native genius was too strong,and he was allowed to enter the Polytechnic School at Gratz, to finish hisstudies, and with the object of becoming a professor of mathematics and physics.One of the machines there experimented with was a Gramme dynamo, used as amotor. Despite his instructor’s perfect demonstration of the fact that it wasimpossible to operate a dynamo without commutator or brushes, Mr. Tesla couldnot be convinced that such accessories were necessary or desirable. He hadalready seen with quick intuition that a way could be found to dispense withthem; and from that time he may be said to have begun work on the ideas thatfructified ultimately in his rotating field motors.In the second year of his Gratz course, Mr. Tesla gave up the notion of becominga teacher, and took up the engineering curriculum. His studies ended, hereturned home in time to see his father die, and then went to Prague andBuda-Pesth to study languages, with the object of qualifying himself broadly forthe practice of the engineering profession. For a short time he served as anassistant in the Government Telegraph Engineering Department, and then becameassociated with M. Puskas, a personal and family friend, and other exploiters ofthe telephone in Hungary. He made a number of telephonic inventions, but foundhis opportunities of benefiting by them limited in various ways. To gain a widerfield of action, he pushed on to Paris and there secured employment as anelectrical engineer with one of the large companies in the new industry ofelectric lighting.It was during this period, and as early as 1882, that he began serious andcontinued efforts to embody the rotating field principle in operative apparatus.He was enthusiastic about it; believed it to mark a new departure in theelectrical arts, and could think of nothing else. In fact, but for thesolicitations of a few friends in commercial circles who urged him to form acompany to exploit the invention, Mr. Tesla, then a youth of little worldlyexperience, would have sought an immediate opportunity to publish his ideas,believing them to be worthy of note as a novel and radical advance in electricaltheory as well as destined to have a profound influence on all dynamo electricmachinery.At last he determined that it would be best to try his fortunes in America. InFrance he had met many Americans, and in contact with them learned thedesirability of turning every new idea in electricity to practical use. Helearned also of the ready encouragement given in the United States to anyinventor who could attain some new and valuable result. The resolution wasformed with characteristic quickness, and abandoning all his prospects inEurope, he at once set his face westward.Arrived in the United States, Mr. Tesla took off his coat the day he arrived, inthe Edison Works. That place had been a goal of his ambition, and one canreadily imagine the benefit and stimulus derived from association with Mr.Edison, for whom Mr. Tesla has always had the strongest admiration. It wasimpossible, however, that, with his own ideas to carry out, and his owninventions to develop, Mr. Tesla could long remain in even the most delightfulemploy; and, his work now attracting attention, he left the Edison ranks to joina company intended to make and sell an arc lighting system based on some of hisinventions in that branch of the art. With unceasing diligence he brought thesystem to perfection, and saw it placed on the market. But the thing which mostoccupied his time and thoughts, however, all through this period, was his olddiscovery of the rotating field principle for alternating current work, and theapplication of it in motors that have now become known the world over.Strong as his convictions on the subject then were, it is a fact that he stoodvery much alone, for the alternating current had no well recognized place. Fewelectrical engineers had ever used it, and the majority were entirely unfamiliarwith its value, or even its essential features. Even Mr. Tesla himself did not,until after protracted effort and experimentation, learn how to constructalternating current apparatus of fair efficiency. But that he had accomplishedhis purpose was shown by the tests of Prof. Anthony, made in the winter of1887–8, when Tesla motors in the hands of that distinguished expert gave anefficiency equal to that of direct current motors. Nothing now stood in the wayof the commercial development and introduction of such motors, except that theyhad to be constructed with a view to operating on the circuits then existing,which in this country were all of high frequency.The first full publication of his work in this direction—outside his patents—wasa paper read before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York,in May, 1888 (read at the suggestion of Prof. Anthony and the present writer),when he exhibited motors that had been in operation long previous, and withwhich his belief that brushes and commutators could be dispensed with, wastriumphantly proved to be correct. The section of this volume devoted to Mr.Tesla’s inventions in the utilization of polyphase currents will show howthoroughly from the outset he had mastered the fundamental idea and applied itin the greatest variety of ways.Having noted for years the many advantages obtainable with alternating currents,Mr. Tesla was naturally led on to experiment with them at higher potentials andhigher frequencies than were common or approved of. Ever pressing forward todetermine in even the slightest degree the outlines of the unknown, he wasrewarded very quickly in this field with results of the most surprising nature.A slight acquaintance with some of these experiments led the compiler of thisvolume to urge Mr. Tesla to repeat them before the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers. This was done in May, 1891, in a lecture that marked,beyond question, a distinct departure in electrical theory and practice, and allthe results of which have not yet made themselves fully apparent. The New Yorklecture, and its successors, two in number, are also included in this volume,with a few supplementary notes.Mr. Tesla’s work ranges far beyond the vast departments of polyphase currentsand high potential lighting. The “Miscellaneous” section of this volume includesa great many other inventions in arc lighting, transformers, pyro-magneticgenerators, thermo-magnetic motors, third-brush regulation, improvements indynamos, new forms of incandescent lamps, electrical meters, condensers,unipolar dynamos, the conversion of alternating into direct currents, etc. It isneedless to say that at this moment Mr. Tesla is engaged on a number ofinteresting ideas and inventions, to be made public in due course. The presentvolume deals simply with his work accomplished to date."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER II [05_Contents.xhtml#r4]A NEW SYSTEM OF ALTERNATING CURRENTMOTORS AND TRANSFORMERS [05_Contents.xhtml#r4]The present section of this volume deals with polyphase currents, and theinventions by Mr. Tesla, made known thus far, in which he has embodied onefeature or another of the broad principle of rotating field poles or resultantattraction exerted on the armature. It is needless to remind electricians of thegreat interest aroused by the first enunciation of the rotating field principle,or to dwell upon the importance of the advance from a single alternatingcurrent, to methods and apparatus which deal with more than one. Simplyprefacing the consideration here attempted of the subject, with the remark thatin nowise is the object of this volume of a polemic or controversial nature, itmay be pointed out that Mr. Tesla’s work has not at all been fully understood orrealized up to date. To many readers, it is believed, the analysis of what hehas done in this department will be a revelation, while it will at the same timeillustrate the beautiful flexibility and range of the principles involved. Itwill be seen that, as just suggested, Mr. Tesla did not stop short at a mererotating field, but dealt broadly with the shifting of the resultant attractionof the magnets. It will be seen that he went on to evolve the “multiphase”system with many ramifications and turns; that he showed the broad idea ofmotors employing currents of differing phase in the armature with directcurrents in the field; that he first described and worked out the idea of anarmature with a body of iron and coils closed upon themselves; that he workedout both synchronizing and torque motors; that he explained and illustrated howmachines of ordinary construction might be adapted to his system; that heemployed condensers in field and armature circuits, and went to the bottom ofthe fundamental principles, testing, approving or rejecting, it would appear,every detail that inventive ingenuity could hit upon.Now that opinion is turning so emphatically in favor of lower frequencies, itdeserves special note that Mr. Tesla early recognized the importance of the lowfrequency feature in motor work. In fact his first motors exhibited publicly—andwhich, as Prof. Anthony showed in his tests in the winter of 1887–8, were theequal of direct current motors in efficiency, output and starting torque—were ofthe low frequency type. The necessity arising, however, to utilize these motorsin connection with the existing high frequency circuits, our survey reveals inan interesting manner Mr. Tesla’s fertility of resource in this direction. Butthat, after exhausting all the possibilities of this field, Mr. Tesla returns tolow frequencies, and insists on the superiority of his polyphase system inalternating current distribution, need not at all surprise us, in view of thestrength of his convictions, so often expressed, on this subject. This is,indeed, significant, and may be regarded as indicative of the probabledevelopment next to be witnessed.Incidental reference has been made to the efficiency of rotating field motors, amatter of much importance, though it is not the intention to dwell upon it here.Prof. Anthony in his remarks before the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers, in May, 1888, on the two small Tesla motors then shown, which he hadtested, stated that one gave an efficiency of about 50 percent and the other alittle over sixty percent. In 1889, some tests were reported from Pittsburgh,made by Mr. Tesla and Mr. Albert Schmid, on motors up to 10 H. P. and weighingabout 850 pounds. These machines showed an efficiency of nearly 90 percent. Withsome larger motors it was then found practicable to obtain an efficiency, withthe three wire system, up to as high as 94 and 95 percent. These interestingfigures, which, of course, might be supplemented by others more elaborate and oflater date, are cited to show that the efficiency of the system has not had towait until the present late day for any demonstration of its commercialusefulness. An invention is none the less beautiful because it may lack utility,but it must be a pleasure to any inventor to know that the ideas he is advancingare fraught with substantial benefits to the public."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER III [05_Contents.xhtml#r5]THE TESLA ROTATING MAGNETIC FIELD—MOTORS WITHCLOSED CONDUCTORS—SYNCHRONIZING MOTORS—ROTATING FIELD TRANSFORMERS [05_Contents.xhtml#r5]The best description that can be given of what he attempted, and succeeded indoing, with the rotating magnetic field, is to be found in Mr. Tesla’s briefpaper explanatory of his rotary current, polyphase system, read before theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers, in New York, in May, 1888, under thetitle “A New System of Alternate Current Motors and Transformers.” As a matterof fact, which a perusal of the paper will establish, Mr. Tesla made no attemptin that paper to describe all his work. It dealt in reality with the few topicsenumerated in the caption of this chapter. Mr. Tesla’s reticence was no doubtdue largely to the fact that his action was governed by the wishes of otherswith whom he was associated, but it may be worth mention that the compiler ofthis volume—who had seen the motors running, and who was then chairman of theInstitute Committee on Papers and Meetings—had great difficulty in inducing Mr.Tesla to give the Institute any paper at all. Mr. Tesla was overworked and ill,and manifested the greatest reluctance to an exhibition of his motors, but hisobjections were at last overcome. The paper was written the night previous tothe meeting, in pencil, very hastily, and under the pressure just mentioned.In this paper casual reference was made to two special forms of motors notwithin the group to be considered. These two forms were: 1. A motor with one ofits circuits in series with a transformer, and the other in the secondary of thetransformer. 2. A motor having its armature circuit connected to the generator,and the field coils closed upon themselves. The paper in its essence is asfollows, dealing with a few leading features of the Tesla system, namely, therotating magnetic field, motors with closed conductors, synchronizing motors,and rotating field transformers:The subject which I now have the pleasure of bringing to your notice is a novelsystem of electric distribution and transmission of power by means of alternatecurrents, affording peculiar advantages, particularly in the way of motors,which I am confident will at once establish the superior adaptability of thesecurrents to the transmission of power and will show that many results heretoforeunattainable can be reached by their use; results which are very much desired inthe practical operation of such systems, and which cannot be accomplished bymeans of continuous currents.Before going into a detailed description of this system, I think it necessary tomake a few remarks with reference to certain conditions existing in continuouscurrent generators and motors, which, although generally known, are frequentlydisregarded.In our dynamo machines, it is well known, we generate alternate currents whichwe direct by means of a commutator, a complicated device and, it may be justlysaid, the source of most of the troubles experienced in the operation of themachines. Now, the currents so directed cannot be utilized in the motor, butthey must—again by means of a similar unreliable device—be reconverted intotheir original state of alternate currents. The function of the commutator isentirely external, and in no way does it affect the internal working of themachines. In reality, therefore, all machines are alternate current machines,the currents appearing as continuous only in the external circuit during theirtransit from generator to motor. In view simply of this fact, alternate currentswould commend themselves as a more direct application of electrical energy, andthe employment of continuous currents would only be justified if we had dynamoswhich would primarily generate, and motors which would be directly actuated by,such currents.But the operation of the commutator on a motor is twofold; first, it reversesthe currents through the motor, and secondly, it effects automatically, aprogressive shifting of the poles of one of its magnetic constituents. Assuming,therefore, that both of the useless operations in the systems, that is to say,the directing of the alternate currents on the generator and reversing thedirect currents on the motor, be eliminated, it would still be necessary, inorder to cause a rotation of the motor, to produce a progressive shifting of thepoles of one of its elements, and the question presented itself—How to performthis operation by the direct action of alternate currents? I will now proceed toshow how this result was accomplished.In the first experiment a drum-armature was provided with two coils at rightangles to each other, and the ends of these coils were connected to two pairs ofinsulated contact-rings as usual. A ring was then made of thin insulated platesof sheet-iron and wound with four coils, each two opposite coils being connectedtogether so as to produce free poles on diametrically opposite sides of thering. The remaining free ends of the coils were then connected to thecontact-rings of the generator armature so as to form two independent circuits,as indicated in Fig. 9. It may now be seen what results were secured in thiscombination, and with this view I would refer to the diagrams, Figs. 1 to 8a.The field of the generator being independently excited, the rotation of thearmature sets up currents in the coils C C1, varying in strength and directionin the well-known manner. In the position shown in Fig. 1, the current in coil Cis nil, while coil C1 is traversed by its maximum current, and the connectionsmay be such that the ring is magnetized by the coils c1 c1, as indicated by theletters N S in Fig. 1a, the magnetizing effect of the coils c c being nil, sincethese coils are included in the circuit of coil C.images [images/fig1.jpg]FIG. 1.images [images/fig1a.jpg]FIG. 1a.In Fig. 2, the armature coils are shown in a more advanced position, one-eighthof one revolution being completed. Fig. 2a illustrates the correspondingmagnetic condition of the ring. At this moment the coil C1 generates a currentof the same direction as previously, but weaker, producing the poles n1 s1 uponthe ring; the coil C also generates a current of the same direction, and theconnections may be such that the coils c c produce the poles n s, as shown inFig. 2a. The resulting polarity is indicated by the letters N S, and it will beobserved that the poles of the ring have been shifted one-eighth of theperiphery of the same.images [images/fig2.jpg]FIG. 2.images [images/fig2a.jpg]FIG. 2a.In Fig. 3 the armature has completed one quarter of one revolution. In thisphase the current in coil C is a maximum, and of such direction as to producethe poles N S in Fig. 3a, whereas the current in coil C1 is nil, this coil beingat its neutral position. The poles N S in Fig. 3a are thus shifted one quarterof the circumference of the ring.images [images/fig3.jpg]FIG. 3.images [images/fig3a.jpg]FIG. 3a.Fig. 4 shows the coils C C in a still more advanced position, the armaturehaving completed three-eighths of one revolution. At that moment the coil Cstill generates a current of the same direction as before, but of less strength,producing the comparatively weaker poles n s in Fig. 4a. The current in the coilC1 is of the same strength, but opposite direction. Its effect is, therefore, toproduce upon the ring the poles n1 s1 as indicated, and a polarity, N S,results, the poles now being shifted three-eighths of the periphery of the ring.images [images/fig4.jpg]FIG. 4.images [images/fig4a.jpg]FIG. 4a.In Fig. 5 one half of one revolution of the armature is completed, and theresulting magnetic condition of the ring is indicated in Fig. 5a. Now thecurrent in coil C is nil, while the coil C1 yields its maximum current, which isof the same direction as previously; the magnetizing effect is, therefore, dueto the coils, c1 c1 alone, and, referring to Fig. 5a, it will be observed thatthe poles N S are shifted one half of the circumference of the ring. During thenext half revolution the operations are repeated, as represented in the Figs. 6to 8a.images [images/fig5.jpg]FIG. 5.images [images/fig5a.jpg]FIG. 5a.images [images/fig6.jpg]FIG. 6.images [images/fig6a.jpg]FIG. 6a.images [images/fig7.jpg]FIG. 7.images [images/fig7a.jpg]FIG. 7a.images [images/fig8.jpg]FIG. 8.images [images/fig8a.jpg]FIG. 8a.A reference to the diagrams will make it clear that during one revolution of thearmature the poles of the ring are shifted once around its periphery, and, eachrevolution producing like effects, a rapid whirling of the poles in harmony withthe rotation of the armature is the result. If the connections of either one ofthe circuits in the ring are reversed, the shifting of the poles is made toprogress in the opposite direction, but the operation is identically the same.Instead of using four wires, with like result, three wires may be used, oneforming a common return for both circuits.This rotation or whirling of the poles manifests itself in a series of curiousphenomena. If a delicately pivoted disc of steel or other magnetic metal isapproached to the ring it is set in rapid rotation, the direction of rotationvarying with the position of the disc. For instance, noting the directionoutside of the ring it will be found that inside the ring it turns in anopposite direction, while it is unaffected if placed in a position symmetricalto the ring. This is easily explained. Each time that a pole approaches, itinduces an opposite pole in the nearest point on the disc, and an attraction isproduced upon that point; owing to this, as the pole is shifted further awayfrom the disc a tangential pull is exerted upon the same, and the action beingconstantly repeated, a more or less rapid rotation of the disc is the result. Asthe pull is exerted mainly upon that part which is nearest to the ring, therotation outside and inside, or right and left, respectively, is in oppositedirections, Fig. 9. When placed symmetrically to the ring, the pull on theopposite sides of the disc being equal, no rotation results. The action is basedon the magnetic inertia of iron; for this reason a disc of hard steel is muchmore affected than a disc of soft iron, the latter being capable of very rapidvariations of magnetism. Such a disc has proved to be a very useful instrumentin all these investigations, as it has enabled me to detect any irregularity inthe action. A curious effect is also produced upon iron filings. By placing someupon a paper and holding them externally quite close to the ring, they are setin a vibrating motion, remaining in the same place, although the paper may bemoved back and forth; but in lifting the paper to a certain height which seemsto be dependent on the intensity of the poles and the speed of rotation, theyare thrown away in a direction always opposite to the supposed movement of thepoles. If a paper with filings is put flat upon the ring and the current turnedon suddenly, the existence of a magnetic whirl may easily be observed.images [images/fig9.jpg]FIG. 9.To demonstrate the complete analogy between the ring and a revolving magnet, astrongly energized electro-magnet was rotated by mechanical power, and phenomenaidentical in every particular to those mentioned above were observed.Obviously, the rotation of the poles produces corresponding inductive effectsand may be utilized to generate currents in a closed conductor placed within theinfluence of the poles. For this purpose it is convenient to wind a ring withtwo sets of superimposed coils forming respectively the primary and secondarycircuits, as shown in Fig. 10. In order to secure the most economical resultsthe magnetic circuit should be completely closed, and with this object in viewthe construction may be modified at will.images [images/fig10.jpg]FIG. 10.The inductive effect exerted upon the secondary coils will be mainly due to theshifting or movement of the magnetic action; but there may also be currents setup in the circuits in consequence of the variations in the intensity of thepoles. However, by properly designing the generator and determining themagnetizing effect of the primary coils, the latter element may be made todisappear. The intensity of the poles being maintained constant, the action ofthe apparatus will be perfect, and the same result will be secured as though theshifting were effected by means of a commutator with an infinite number of bars.In such case the theoretical relation between the energizing effect of each setof primary coils and their resultant magnetizing effect may be expressed by theequation of a circle having its center coinciding with that of an orthogonalsystem of axes, and in which the radius represents the resultant and thecoordinates both of its components. These are then respectively the sine andcosine of the angle a between the radius and one of the axes (O X). Referring toFig. 11, we have r2 = x2 + y2; where x = r cos a, and y = r sin a.images [images/fig11.jpg]FIG. 11.Assuming the magnetizing effect of each set of coils in the transformer to beproportional to the current—which may be admitted for weak degrees ofmagnetization—then x = K c and y = K c1, where K is a constant and c and c1 thecurrent in both sets of coils respectively. Supposing, further, the field of thegenerator to be uniform, we have for constant speed c1 = K1 sin a and c = K1 sin(90° + a) = K1 cos a, where K1 is a constant. See Fig. 12.images [images/fig12.jpg]FIG. 12.Therefore,    x = K c = K K1 cos a; y = K c1 = K K1 sin a; and K K1 = r.That is, for a uniform field the disposition of the two coils at right angleswill secure the theoretical result, and the intensity of the shifting poles willbe constant. But from r2 = x2 + y2 it follows that for y = 0, r = x; it followsthat the joint magnetizing effect of both sets of coils should be equal to theeffect of one set when at its maximum action. In transformers and in a certainclass of motors the fluctuation of the poles is not of great importance, but inanother class of these motors it is desirable to obtain the theoretical result.In applying this principle to the construction of motors, two typical forms ofmotor have been developed. First, a form having a comparatively small rotaryeffort at the start but maintaining a perfectly uniform speed at all loads,which motor has been termed synchronous. Second, a form possessing a greatrotary effort at the start, the speed being dependent on the load.These motors may be operated in three different ways: 1. By the alternatecurrents of the source only. 2. By a combined action of these and of inducedcurrents. 3. By the joint action of alternate and continuous currents.The simplest form of a synchronous motor is obtained by winding a laminated ringprovided with pole projections with four coils, and connecting the same in themanner before indicated. An iron disc having a segment cut away on each side maybe used as an armature. Such a motor is shown in Fig. 9. The disc being arrangedto rotate freely within the ring in close proximity to the projections, it isevident that as the poles are shifted it will, owing to its tendency to placeitself in such a position as to embrace the greatest number of the lines offorce, closely follow the movement of the poles, and its motion will besynchronous with that of the armature of the generator; that is, in the peculiardisposition shown in Fig. 9, in which the armature produces by one revolutiontwo current impulses in each of the circuits. It is evident that if, by onerevolution of the armature, a greater number of impulses is produced, the speedof the motor will be correspondingly increased. Considering that the attractionexerted upon the disc is greatest when the same is in close proximity to thepoles, it follows that such a motor will maintain exactly the same speed at allloads within the limits of its capacity.To facilitate the starting, the disc may be provided with a coil closed uponitself. The advantage secured by such a coil is evident. On the start thecurrents set up in the coil strongly energize the disc and increase theattraction exerted upon the same by the ring, and currents being generated inthe coil as long as the speed of the armature is inferior to that of the poles,considerable work may be performed by such a motor even if the speed be belownormal. The intensity of the poles being constant, no currents will be generatedin the coil when the motor is turning at its normal speed.Instead of closing the coil upon itself, its ends may be connected to twoinsulated sliding rings, and a continuous current supplied to these from asuitable generator. The proper way to start such a motor is to close the coilupon itself until the normal speed is reached, or nearly so, and then turn onthe continuous current. If the disc be very strongly energized by a continuouscurrent the motor may not be able to start, but if it be weakly energized, orgenerally so that the magnetizing effect of the ring is preponderating, it willstart and reach the normal speed. Such a motor will maintain absolutely the samespeed at all loads. It has also been found that if the motive power of thegenerator is not excessive, by checking the motor the speed of the generator isdiminished in synchronism with that of the motor. It is characteristic of thisform of motor that it cannot be reversed by reversing the continuous currentthrough the coil.The synchronism of these motors may be demonstrated experimentally in a varietyof ways. For this purpose it is best to employ a motor consisting of astationary field magnet and an armature arranged to rotate within the same, asindicated in Fig. 13. In this case the shifting of the poles of the armatureproduces a rotation of the latter in the opposite direction. It resultstherefrom that when the normal speed is reached, the poles of the armatureassume fixed positions relatively to the field magnet, and the same ismagnetized by induction, exhibiting a distinct pole on each of the pole-pieces.If a piece of soft iron is approached to the field magnet, it will at the startbe attracted with a rapid vibrating motion produced by the reversals of polarityof the magnet, but as the speed of the armature increases, the vibrations becomeless and less frequent and finally entirely cease. Then the iron is weakly butpermanently attracted, showing that synchronism is reached and the field magnetenergized by induction.images [images/fig13.jpg]FIG. 13.The disc may also be used for the experiment. If held quite close to thearmature it will turn as long as the speed of rotation of the poles exceeds thatof the armature; but when the normal speed is reached, or very nearly so, itceases to rotate and is permanently attracted.A crude but illustrative experiment is made with an incandescent lamp. Placingthe lamp in circuit with the continuous current generator and in series with themagnet coil, rapid fluctuations are observed in the light in consequence of theinduced currents set up in the coil at the start; the speed increasing, thefluctuations occur at longer intervals, until they entirely disappear, showingthat the motor has attained its normal speed. A telephone receiver affords amost sensitive instrument; when connected to any circuit in the motor thesynchronism may be easily detected on the disappearance of the induced currents.In motors of the synchronous type it is desirable to maintain the quantity ofthe shifting magnetism constant, especially if the magnets are not properlysubdivided.To obtain a rotary effort in these motors was the subject of long thought. Inorder to secure this result it was necessary to make such a disposition thatwhile the poles of one element of the motor are shifted by the alternatecurrents of the source, the poles produced upon the other elements should alwaysbe maintained in the proper relation to the former, irrespective of the speed ofthe motor. Such a condition exists in a continuous current motor; but in asynchronous motor, such as described, this condition is fulfilled only when thespeed is normal.The object has been attained by placing within the ring a properly subdividedcylindrical iron core wound with several independent coils closed uponthemselves. Two coils at right angles as in Fig. 14, are sufficient, but agreater number may be advantageously employed. It results from this dispositionthat when the poles of the ring are shifted, currents are generated in theclosed armature coils. These currents are the most intense at or near the pointsof the greatest density of the lines of force, and their effect is to producepoles upon the armature at right angles to those of the ring, at leasttheoretically so; and since this action is entirely independent of thespeed—that is, as far as the location of the poles is concerned—a continuouspull is exerted upon the periphery of the armature. In many respects thesemotors are similar to the continuous current motors. If load is put on, thespeed, and also the resistance of the motor, is diminished and more current ismade to pass through the energizing coils, thus increasing the effort. Upon theload being taken off, the counter-electromotive force increases and less currentpasses through the primary or energizing coils. Without any load the speed isvery nearly equal to that of the shifting poles of the field magnet.images [images/fig14.jpg]FIG. 14.It will be found that the rotary effort in these motors fully equals that of thecontinuous current motors. The effort seems to be greatest when both armatureand field magnet are without any projections; but as in such dispositions thefield cannot be concentrated, probably the best results will be obtained byleaving pole projections on one of the elements only. Generally, it may bestated the projections diminish the torque and produce a tendency tosynchronism.A characteristic feature of motors of this kind is their property of being veryrapidly reversed. This follows from the peculiar action of the motor. Supposethe armature to be rotating and the direction of rotation of the poles to bereversed. The apparatus then represents a dynamo machine, the power to drivethis machine being the momentum stored up in the armature and its speed beingthe sum of the speeds of the armature and the poles.If we now consider that the power to drive such a dynamo would be very nearlyproportional to the third power of the speed, for that reason alone the armatureshould be quickly reversed. But simultaneously with the reversal another elementis brought into action, namely, as the movement of the poles with respect to thearmature is reversed, the motor acts like a transformer in which the resistanceof the secondary circuit would be abnormally diminished by producing in thiscircuit an additional electromotive force. Owing to these causes the reversal isinstantaneous.If it is desirable to secure a constant speed, and at the same time a certaineffort at the start, this result may be easily attained in a variety of ways.For instance, two armatures, one for torque and the other for synchronism, maybe fastened on the same shaft and any desired preponderance may be given toeither one, or an armature may be wound for rotary effort, but a more or lesspronounced tendency to synchronism may be given to it by properly constructingthe iron core; and in many other ways.As a means of obtaining the required phase of the currents in both the circuits,the disposition of the two coils at right angles is the simplest, securing themost uniform action; but the phase may be obtained in many other ways, varyingwith the machine employed. Any of the dynamos at present in use may be easilyadapted for this purpose by making connections to proper points of thegenerating coils. In closed circuit armatures, such as used in the continuouscurrent systems, it is best to make four derivations from equi-distant points orbars of the commutator, and to connect the same to four insulated sliding ringson the shaft. In this case each of the motor circuits is connected to twodiametrically opposite bars of the commutator. In such a disposition the motormay also be operated at half the potential and on the three-wire plan, byconnecting the motor circuits in the proper order to three of the contact rings.In multipolar dynamo machines, such as used in the converter systems, the phaseis conveniently obtained by winding upon the armature two series of coils insuch a manner that while the coils of one set or series are at their maximumproduction of current, the coils of the other will be at their neutral position,or nearly so, whereby both sets of coils may be subjected simultaneously orsuccessively to the inducing action of the field magnets.Generally the circuits in the motor will be similarly disposed, and variousarrangements may be made to fulfill the requirements; but the simplest and mostpracticable is to arrange primary circuits on stationary parts of the motor,thereby obviating, at least in certain forms, the employment of slidingcontacts. In such a case the magnet coils are connected alternately in both thecircuits; that is, 1, 3, 5 … in one, and 2, 4, 6 … in the other, and the coilsof each set of series may be connected all in the same manner, or alternately inopposition; in the latter case a motor with half the number of poles willresult, and its action will be correspondingly modified. The Figs. 15, 16, and17, show three different phases, the magnet coils in each circuit beingconnected alternately in opposition. In this case there will be always fourpoles, as in Figs. 15 and 17; four pole projections will be neutral; and in Fig.16 two adjacent pole projections will have the same polarity. If the coils areconnected in the same manner there will be eight alternating poles, as indicatedby the letters n′ s′ in Fig. 15.images [images/fig15.jpg]FIG. 15.images [images/fig16.jpg]FIG. 16.images [images/fig17.jpg]FIG. 17.The employment of multipolar motors secures in this system an advantage muchdesired and unattainable in the continuous current system, and that is, that amotor may be made to run exactly at a predetermined speed irrespective ofimperfections in construction, of the load, and, within certain limits, ofelectromotive force and current strength.In a general distribution system of this kind the following plan should beadopted. At the central station of supply a generator should be provided havinga considerable number of poles. The motors operated from this generator shouldbe of the synchronous type, but possessing sufficient rotary effort to insuretheir starting. With the observance of proper rules of construction it may beadmitted that the speed of each motor will be in some inverse proportion to itssize, and the number of poles should be chosen accordingly. Still, exceptionaldemands may modify this rule. In view of this, it will be advantageous toprovide each motor with a greater number of pole projections or coils, thenumber being preferably a multiple of two and three. By this means, by simplychanging the connections of the coils, the motor may be adapted to any probabledemands.If the number of the poles in the motor is even, the action will be harmoniousand the proper result will be obtained; if this is not the case, the best planto be followed is to make a motor with a double number of poles and connect thesame in the manner before indicated, so that half the number of poles result.Suppose, for instance, that the generator has twelve poles, and it would bedesired to obtain a speed equal to images [images/img_p38.jpg] of the speed ofthe generator. This would require a motor with seven pole projections ormagnets, and such a motor could not be properly connected in the circuits unlessfourteen armature coils would be provided, which would necessitate theemployment of sliding contacts. To avoid this, the motor should be provided withfourteen magnets and seven connected in each circuit, the magnets in eachcircuit alternating among themselves. The armature should have fourteen closedcoils. The action of the motor will not be quite as perfect as in the case of aneven number of poles, but the drawback will not be of a serious nature.However, the disadvantages resulting from this unsymmetrical form will bereduced in the same proportion as the number of the poles is augmented.If the generator has, say, n, and the motor n1 poles, the speed of the motorwill be equal to that of the generator multiplied by images[images/img_p39.jpg].The speed of the motor will generally be dependent on the number of the poles,but there may be exceptions to this rule. The speed may be modified by the phaseof the currents in the circuit or by the character of the current impulses or byintervals between each or between groups of impulses. Some of the possible casesare indicated in the diagrams, Figs. 18, 19, 20 and 21, which areself-explanatory. Fig. 18 represents the condition generally existing, and whichsecures the best result. In such a case, if the typical form of motorillustrated in Fig. 9 is employed, one complete wave in each circuit willproduce one revolution of the motor. In Fig. 19 the same result will be effectedby one wave in each circuit, the impulses being successive; in Fig. 20 by four,and in Fig. 21 by eight waves.images [images/fig18.jpg]FIG. 18.images [images/fig19.jpg]FIG. 19.images [images/fig20.jpg]FIG. 20.images [images/fig21.jpg]FIG. 21.By such means any desired speed may be attained, that is, at least within thelimits of practical demands. This system possesses this advantage, besidesothers, resulting from simplicity. At full loads the motors show an efficiencyfully equal to that of the continuous current motors. The transformers presentan additional advantage in their capability of operating motors. They arecapable of similar modifications in construction, and will facilitate theintroduction of motors and their adaptation to practical demands. Theirefficiency should be higher than that of the present transformers, and I base myassertion on the following:In a transformer, as constructed at present, we produce the currents in thesecondary circuit by varying the strength of the primary or exciting currents.If we admit proportionality with respect to the iron core the inductive effectexerted upon the secondary coil will be proportional to the numerical sum of thevariations in the strength of the exciting current per unit of time; whence itfollows that for a given variation any prolongation of the primary current willresult in a proportional loss. In order to obtain rapid variations in thestrength of the current, essential to efficient induction, a great number ofundulations are employed; from this practice various disadvantages result. Theseare: Increased cost and diminished efficiency of the generator; more waste ofenergy in heating the cores, and also diminished output of the transformer,since the core is not properly utilized, the reversals being too rapid. Theinductive effect is also very small in certain phases, as will be apparent froma graphic representation, and there may be periods of inaction, if there areintervals between the succeeding current impulses or waves. In producing ashifting of the poles in a transformer, and thereby inducing currents, theinduction is of the ideal character, being always maintained at its maximumaction. It is also reasonable to assume that by a shifting of the poles lessenergy will be wasted than by reversals."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV [05_Contents.xhtml#r6]MODIFICATIONS AND EXPANSIONS OF THETESLA POLYPHASE SYSTEMS [05_Contents.xhtml#r6]In his earlier papers and patents relative to polyphase currents, Mr. Tesladevoted himself chiefly to an enunciation of the broad lines and ideas lying atthe basis of this new work; but he supplemented this immediately by a series ofother striking inventions which may be regarded as modifications and expansionsof certain features of the Tesla systems. These we shall now proceed to dealwith.In the preceding chapters we have thus shown and described the Tesla electricalsystems for the transmission of power and the conversion and distribution ofelectrical energy, in which the motors and the transformers contain two or morecoils or sets of coils, which were connected up in independent circuits withcorresponding coils of an alternating current generator, the operation of thesystem being brought about by the co-operation of the alternating currents inthe independent circuits in progressively moving or shifting the poles or pointsof maximum magnetic effect of the motors or converters. In these systems twoindependent conductors are employed for each of the independent circuitsconnecting the generator with the devices for converting the transmittedcurrents into mechanical energy or into electric currents of another character.This, however, is not always necessary. The two or more circuits may have asingle return path or wire in common, with a loss, if any, which is so extremelyslight that it may be disregarded entirely. For the sake of illustration, if thegenerator have two independent coils and the motor two coils or two sets ofcoils in corresponding relations to its operative elements one terminal of eachgenerator coil is connected to the corresponding terminals of the motor coilsthrough two independent conductors, while the opposite terminals of therespective coils are both connected to one return wire. The followingdescription deals with the modification. Fig. 22 is a diagrammatic illustrationof a generator and single motor constructed and electrically connected inaccordance with the invention. Fig. 23 is a diagram of the system as it is usedin operating motors or converters, or both, in parallel, while Fig. 24illustrates diagrammatically the manner of operating two or more motors orconverters, or both, in series. Referring to Fig. 22, A A designate the poles ofthe field magnets of an alternating-current generator, the armature of which,being in this case cylindrical in form and mounted on a shaft, C, is woundlongitudinally with coils B B′. The shaft C carries three insulatedcontact-rings, a b c, to two of which, as b c, one terminal of each coil, as ed, is connected. The remaining terminals, f g, are both connected to the thirdring, a.images [images/fig22.jpg]FIG. 22.images [images/fig23.jpg]FIG. 23.images [images/fig24.jpg]FIG. 24.A motor in this case is shown as composed of a ring, H, wound with four coils, II J J, electrically connected, so as to co-operate in pairs, with a tendency tofix the poles of the ring at four points ninety degrees apart. Within themagnetic ring H is a disc or cylindrical core wound with two coils, G G′, whichmay be connected to form two closed circuits. The terminals j k of the two setsor pairs of coils are connected, respectively, to the binding-posts E′ F′, andthe other terminals, h i, are connected to a single binding-post, D′. To operatethe motor, three line-wires are used to connect the terminals of the generatorwith those of the motor.So far as the apparent action or mode of operation of this arrangement isconcerned, the single wire D, which is, so to speak, a common return-wire forboth circuits, may be regarded as two independent wires. In the illustration,with the order of connection shown, coil B′ of the generator is producing itsmaximum current and coil B its minimum; hence the current which passes throughwire e, ring b, brush b′, line-wire E, terminal E′, wire j, coils I I, wire orterminal D′, line-wire D, brush a′, ring a, and wire f, fixes the polar line ofthe motor midway between the two coils I I; but as the coil B′ moves from theposition indicated it generates less current, while coil B, moving into thefield, generates more. The current from coil B passes through the devices andwires designated by the letters d, c, C′ F, F′ k, J J, i, D′, D, a′, a, and g,and the position of the poles of the motor will be due to the resultant effectof the currents in the two sets of coils—that is, it will be advanced inproportion to the advance or forward movement of the armature coils. Themovement of the generator-armature through one-quarter of a revolution willobviously bring coil B′ into its neutral position and coil B into its positionof maximum effect, and this shifts the poles ninety degrees, as they are fixedsolely by coils B. This action is repeated for each quarter of a completerevolution.When more than one motor or other device is employed, they may be run either inparallel or series. In Fig. 23 the former arrangement is shown. The electricaldevice is shown as a converter, L, of which the two sets of primary coils p rare connected, respectively, to the mains F E, which are electrically connectedwith the two coils of the generator. The cross-circuit wires l m, making theseconnections, are then connected to the common return-wire D. The secondary coilsp′ p″ are in circuits n o, including, for example, incandescent lamps. Only oneconverter is shown entire in this figure, the others being illustrateddiagrammatically.When motors or converters are to be run in series, the two wires E F are ledfrom the generator to the coils of the first motor or converter, then continuedon to the next, and so on through the whole series, and are then joined to thesingle wire D, which completes both circuits through the generator. This isshown in Fig. 24, in which J I represent the two coils or sets of coils of themotors.There are, of course, other conditions under which the same idea may be carriedout. For example, in case the motor and generator each has three independentcircuits, one terminal of each circuit is connected to a line-wire, and theother three terminals to a common return-conductor. This arrangement will securesimilar results to those attained with a generator and motor having but twoindependent circuits, as above described.When applied to such machines and motors as have three or more induced circuitswith a common electrical joint, the three or more terminals of the generatorwould be simply connected to those of the motor. Mr. Tesla states, however, thatthe results obtained in this manner show a lower efficiency than do the formsdwelt upon more fully above."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER V [05_Contents.xhtml#r7]UTILIZING FAMILIAR TYPES OF GENERATOROF THE CONTINUOUS CURRENT TYPE [05_Contents.xhtml#r7]The preceding descriptions have assumed the use of alternating currentgenerators in which, in order to produce the progressive movement of themagnetic poles, or of the resultant attraction of independent field magnets, thecurrent generating coils are independent or separate. The ordinary forms ofcontinuous current dynamos may, however, be employed for the same work, inaccordance with a method of adaptation devised by Mr. Tesla. As will be seen,the modification involves but slight changes in their construction, and presentsother elements of economy.On the shaft of a given generator, either in place of or in addition to theregular commutator, are secured as many pairs of insulated collecting-rings asthere are circuits to be operated. Now, it will be understood that in theoperation of any dynamo electric generator the currents in the coils in theirmovement through the field of force undergo different phases—that is to say, atdifferent positions of the coils the currents have certain directions andcertain strengths—and that in the Tesla motors or transformers it is necessarythat the currents in the energizing coils should undergo a certain order ofvariations in strength and direction. Hence, the further step—viz., theconnection between the induced or generating coils of the machine and thecontact-rings from which the currents are to be taken off—will be determinedsolely by what order of variations of strength and direction in the currents isdesired for producing a given result in the electrical translating device. Thismay be accomplished in various ways; but in the drawings we give typicalinstances only of the best and most practicable ways of applying the inventionto three of the leading types of machines in widespread use, in order toillustrate the principle.Fig. 25 is a diagram illustrative of the mode of applying the invention to thewell-known type of “closed” or continuous circuit machines. Fig. 26 is a similardiagram embodying an armature with separate coils connected diametrically, orwhat is generally called an “open-circuit” machine. Fig. 27 is a diagram showingthe application of the invention to a machine the armature-coils of which have acommon joint.images [images/fig25.jpg]FIG. 25.images [images/fig26.jpg]FIG. 26.images [images/fig27.jpg]FIG. 27.Referring to Fig. 25, let A represent a Tesla motor or transformer which, forconvenience, we will designate as a “converter.” It consists of an annular core,B, wound with four independent coils, C and D, those diametrically oppositebeing connected together so as to co-operate in pairs in establishing free polesin the ring, the tendency of each pair being to fix the poles at ninety degreesfrom the other. There may be an armature, E, within the ring, which is woundwith coils closed upon themselves. The object is to pass through coils C Dcurrents of such relative strength and direction as to produce a progressiveshifting or movement of the points of maximum magnetic effect around the ring,and to thereby maintain a rotary movement of the armature. There are thereforesecured to the shaft F of the generator, four insulated contact-rings, a b c d,upon which bear the collecting-brushes a′ b′ c′ d′, connected by wires G G H H,respectively, with the terminals of coils C and D.Assume, for sake of illustration, that the coils D D are to receive the maximumand coils C C at the same instant the minimum current, so that the polar linemay be midway between the coils D D. The rings a b would therefore be connectedto the continuous armature-coil at its neutral points with respect to the field,or the point corresponding with that of the ordinary commutator brushes, andbetween which exists the greatest difference of potential; while rings c d wouldbe connected to two points in the coil, between which exists no difference ofpotential. The best results will be obtained by making these connections atpoints equidistant from one another, as shown. These connections are easiestmade by using wires L between the rings and the loops or wires J, connecting thecoil I to the segments of the commutator K. When the converters are made in thismanner, it is evident that the phases of the currents in the sections of thegenerator coil will be reproduced in the converter coils. For example, afterturning through an arc of ninety degrees the conductors L L, which beforeconveyed the maximum current, will receive the minimum current by reason of thechange in the position of their coils, and it is evident that for the samereason the current in these coils has gradually fallen from the maximum to theminimum in passing through the arc of ninety degrees. In this special plan ofconnections, the rotation of the magnetic poles of the converter will besynchronous with that of the armature coils of the generator, and the resultwill be the same, whether the energizing circuits are derivations from acontinuous armature coil or from independent coils, as in Mr. Tesla’s otherdevices.In Fig. 25, the brushes M M are shown in dotted lines in their proper normalposition. In practice these brushes may be removed from the commutator and thefield of the generator excited by an external source of current; or the brushesmay be allowed to remain on the commutator and to take off a converted currentto excite the field, or to be used for other purposes.In a certain well-known class of machines known as the “open circuit,” thearmature contains a number of coils the terminals of which connect to commutatorsegments, the coils being connected across the armature in pairs. This type ofmachine is represented in Fig. 26. In this machine each pair of coils goesthrough the same phases as the coils in some of the generators already shown,and it is obviously only necessary to utilize them in pairs or sets to operate aTesla converter by extending the segments of the commutators belonging to eachpair of coils and causing a collecting brush to bear on the continuous portionof each segment. In this way two or more circuits may be taken off from thegenerator, each including one or more pairs or sets of coils as may be desired.In Fig. 26 I I represent the armature coils, T T the poles of the field magnet,and F the shaft carrying the commutators, which are extended to form continuousportions a b c d. The brushes bearing on the continuous portions for taking offthe alternating currents are represented by a′ b′ c′ d′. The collecting brushes,or those which may be used to take off the direct current, are designated by MM. Two pairs of the armature coils and their commutators are shown in the figureas being utilized; but all may be utilized in a similar manner.There is another well-known type of machine in which three or more coils, A′ B′C′, on the armature have a common joint, the free ends being connected to thesegments of a commutator. This form of generator is illustrated in Fig. 27. Inthis case each terminal of the generator is connected directly or in derivationto a continuous ring, a b c, and collecting brushes, a′ b′ c′, bearing thereon,take off the alternating currents that operate the motor. It is preferable inthis case to employ a motor or transformer with three energizing coils, A″ B″C″, placed symmetrically with those of the generator, and the circuits from thelatter are connected to the terminals of such coils either directly—as when theyare stationary—or by means of brushes e′ and contact rings e. In this, as in theother cases, the ordinary commutator may be used on the generator, and thecurrent taken from it utilized for exciting the generator field-magnets or forother purposes."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI [05_Contents.xhtml#r8]METHOD OF OBTAINING DESIRED SPEEDOF MOTOR OR GENERATOR [05_Contents.xhtml#r8]With the object of obtaining the desired speed in motors operated by means ofalternating currents of differing phase, Mr. Tesla has devised various plansintended to meet the practical requirements of the case, in adapting his systemto types of multipolar alternating current machines yielding a large number ofcurrent reversals for each revolution.For example, Mr. Tesla has pointed out that to adapt a given type of alternatingcurrent generator, you may couple rigidly two complete machines, securing themtogether in such a way that the requisite difference in phase will be produced;or you may fasten two armatures to the same shaft within the influence of thesame field and with the requisite angular displacement to yield the properdifference in phase between the two currents; or two armatures may be attachedto the same shaft with their coils symmetrically disposed, but subject to theinfluence of two sets of field magnets duly displaced; or the two sets of coilsmay be wound on the same armature alternately or in such manner that they willdevelop currents the phases of which differ in time sufficiently to produce therotation of the motor.Another method included in the scope of the same idea, whereby a singlegenerator may run a number of motors either at its own rate of speed or all atdifferent speeds, is to construct the motors with fewer poles than thegenerator, in which case their speed will be greater than that of the generator,the rate of speed being higher as the number of their poles is relatively less.This may be understood from an example, taking a generator that has twoindependent generating coils which revolve between two pole pieces oppositelymagnetized; and a motor with energizing coils that produce at any given time twomagnetic poles in one element that tend to set up a rotation of the motor. Agenerator thus constructed yields four reversals, or impulses, in eachrevolution, two in each of its independent circuits; and the effect upon themotor is to shift the magnetic poles through three hundred and sixty degrees. Itis obvious that if the four reversals in the same order could be produced byeach half-revolution of the generator the motor would make two revolutions tothe generator’s one. This would be readily accomplished by adding twointermediate poles to the generator or altering it in any of the otherequivalent ways above indicated. The same rule applies to generators and motorswith multiple poles. For instance, if a generator be constructed with twocircuits, each of which produces twelve reversals of current to a revolution,and these currents be directed through the independent energizing-coils of amotor, the coils of which are so applied as to produce twelve magnetic poles atall times, the rotation of the two will be synchronous; but if the motor-coilsproduce but six poles, the movable element will be rotated twice while thegenerator rotates once; or if the motor have four poles, its rotation will bethree times as fast as that of the generator.These features, so far as necessary to an understanding of the principle, arehere illustrated. Fig. 28 is a diagrammatic illustration of a generatorconstructed in accordance with the invention. Fig. 29 is a similar view of acorrespondingly constructed motor. Fig. 30 is a diagram of a generator ofmodified construction. Fig. 31 is a diagram of a motor of correspondingcharacter. Fig. 32 is a diagram of a system containing a generator and severalmotors adapted to run at various speeds.images [images/fig28.jpg]FIG. 28.images [images/fig29.jpg]FIG. 29.images [images/fig30.jpg]FIG. 30.images [images/fig31.jpg]FIG. 31.images [images/fig32.jpg]FIG. 32.In Fig. 28, let C represent a cylindrical armature core wound longitudinallywith insulated coils A A, which are connected up in series, the terminals of theseries being connected to collecting-rings a a on the shaft G. By means of thisshaft the armature is mounted to rotate between the poles of an annularfield-magnet D, formed with polar projections wound with coils E, that magnetizethe said projections. The coils E are included in the circuit of a generator F,by means of which the field-magnet is energized. If thus constructed, themachine is a well-known form of alternating-current generator. To adapt it tohis system, however, Mr. Tesla winds on armature C a second set of coils B Bintermediate to the first, or, in other words, in such positions that while thecoils of one set are in the relative positions to the poles of the field-magnetto produce the maximum current, those of the other set will be in the positionin which they produce the minimum current. The coils B are connected, also, inseries and to two connecting-rings, secured generally to the shaft at theopposite end of the armature.The motor shown in Fig. 29 has an annular field-magnet H, with four pole-pieceswound with coils I. The armature is constructed similarly to the generator, butwith two sets of two coils in closed circuits to correspond with the reducednumber of magnetic poles in the field. From the foregoing it is evident that onerevolution of the armature of the generator producing eight current impulses ineach circuit will produce two revolutions of the motor-armature.The application of the principle of this invention is not, however, confined toany particular form of machine. In Figs. 30 and 31 a generator and motor ofanother well-known type are shown. In Fig. 30, J J are magnets disposed in acircle and wound with coils K, which are in circuit with a generator whichsupplies the current that maintains the field of force. In the usualconstruction of these machines the armature-conductor L is carried by a suitableframe, so as to be rotated in face of the magnets J J, or between these magnetsand another similar set in front of them. The magnets are energized so as to beof alternately opposite polarity throughout the series, so that as the conductorC is rotated the current impulses combine or are added to one another, thoseproduced by the conductor in any given position being all in the same direction.To adapt such a machine to his system, Mr. Tesla adds a second set of inducedconductors M, in all respects similar to the first, but so placed in referenceto it that the currents produced in each will differ by a quarter-phase. Withsuch relations it is evident that as the current decreases in conductor L itincreases in conductor M, and conversely, and that any of the forms of Teslamotor invented for use in this system may be operated by such a generator.Fig. 31 is intended to show a motor corresponding to the machine in Fig. 30. Theconstruction of the motor is identical with that of the generator, and ifcoupled thereto it will run synchronously therewith. J′ J′ are thefield-magnets, and K′ the coils thereon. L′ is one of the armature-conductorsand M′ the other.Fig. 32 shows in diagram other forms of machine. The generator N in this case isshown as consisting of a stationary ring O, wound with twenty-four coils P P′,alternate coils being connected in series in two circuits. Within this ring is adisc or drum Q, with projections Q′ wound with energizing-coils included incircuit with a generator R. By driving this disc or cylinder alternatingcurrents are produced in the coils P and P′, which are carried off to run theseveral motors.The motors are composed of a ring or annular field-magnet S, wound with two setsof energizing-coils T T′, and armatures U, having projections U′ wound withcoils V, all connected in series in a closed circuit or each closedindependently on itself.Suppose the twelve generator-coils P are wound alternately in oppositedirections, so that any two adjacent coils of the same set tend to produce afree pole in the ring O between them and the twelve coils P′ to be similarlywound. A single revolution of the disc or cylinder Q, the twelve polarprojections of which are of opposite polarity, will therefore produce twelvecurrent impulses in each of the circuits W W′. Hence the motor X, which hassixteen coils or eight free poles, will make one and a half turns to thegenerator’s one. The motor Y, with twelve coils or six poles, will rotate withtwice the speed of the generator, and the motor Z, with eight coils or fourpoles, will revolve three times as fast as the generator. These multipolarmotors have a peculiarity which may be often utilized to great advantage. Forexample, in the motor X, Fig. 32, the eight poles may be either alternatelyopposite or there may be at any given time alternately two like and two oppositepoles. This is readily attained by making the proper electrical connections. Theeffect of such a change, however, would be the same as reducing the number ofpoles one-half, and thereby doubling the speed of any given motor.It is obvious that the Tesla electrical transformers which have independentprimary currents may be used with the generators described. It may also bestated with respect to the devices we now describe that the most perfect andharmonious action of the generators and motors is obtained when the numbers ofthe poles of each are even and not odd. If this is not the case, there will be acertain unevenness of action which is the less appreciable as the number ofpoles is greater; although this may be in a measure corrected by specialprovisions which it is not here necessary to explain. It also follows, as amatter of course, that if the number of the poles of the motor be greater thanthat of the generator the motor will revolve at a slower speed than thegenerator.In this chapter, we may include a method devised by Mr. Tesla for avoiding thevery high speeds which would be necessary with large generators. In lieu ofrevolving the generator armature at a high rate of speed, he secures the desiredresult by a rotation of the magnetic poles of one element of the generator,while driving the other at a different speed. The effect is the same as thatyielded by a very high rate of rotation.In this instance, the generator which supplies the current for operating themotors or transformers consists of a subdivided ring or annular core wound withfour diametrically-opposite coils, E E′, Fig. 33. Within the ring is mounted acylindrical armature-core wound longitudinally with two independent coils, F F′,the ends of which lead, respectively, to two pairs of insulated contact orcollecting rings, D D′ G G′, on the armature shaft. Collecting brushes d d′ g g′bear upon these rings, respectively, and convey the currents through the twoindependent line-circuits M M′. In the main line there may be included one ormore motors or transformers, or both. If motors be used, they are of the usualform of Tesla construction with independent coils or sets of coils J J′,included, respectively, in the circuits M M′. These energizing-coils are woundon a ring or annular field or on pole pieces thereon, and produce by the actionof the alternating currents passing through them a progressive shifting of themagnetism from pole to pole. The cylindrical armature H of the motor is woundwith two coils at right angles, which form independent closed circuits.images [images/fig33.jpg]FIG. 33.If transformers be employed, one set of the primary coils, as N N, wound on aring or annular core is connected to one circuit, as M′, and the other primarycoils, N N′, to the circuit M. The secondary coils K K′ may then be utilized forrunning groups of incandescent lamps P P′.With this generator an exciter is employed. This consists of two poles, A A, ofsteel permanently magnetized, or of iron excited by a battery or other generatorof continuous currents, and a cylindrical armature core mounted on a shaft, B,and wound with two longitudinal coils, C C′. One end of each of these coils isconnected to the collecting-rings b c, respectively, while the other ends areboth connected to a ring, a. Collecting-brushes b′ c′ bear on the rings b c,respectively, and conductors L L convey the currents therefrom through the coilsE and E of the generator. L′ is a common return-wire to brush a′. Twoindependent circuits are thus formed, one including coils C of the exciter and EE of the generator, the other coils C′ of the exciter and E′ E′ of thegenerator. It results from this that the operation of the exciter produces aprogressive movement of the magnetic poles of the annular field-core of thegenerator, the shifting or rotary movement of the poles being synchronous withthe rotation of the exciter armature. Considering the operative conditions of asystem thus established, it will be found that when the exciter is driven so asto energize the field of the generator, the armature of the latter, if left freeto turn, would rotate at a speed practically the same as that of the exciter. Ifunder such conditions the coils F F′ of the generator armature be closed uponthemselves or short-circuited, no currents, at least theoretically, will begenerated in these armature coils. In practice the presence of slight currentsis observed, the existence of which is attributable to more or less pronouncedfluctuations in the intensity of the magnetic poles of the generator ring. So,if the armature-coils F F′ be closed through the motor, the latter will not beturned as long as the movement of the generator armature is synchronous withthat of the exciter or of the magnetic poles of its field. If, on the contrary,the speed of the generator armature be in any way checked, so that the shiftingor rotation of the poles of the field becomes relatively more rapid, currentswill be induced in the armature coils. This obviously follows from the passingof the lines of force across the armature conductors. The greater the speed ofrotation of the magnetic poles relatively to that of the armature the morerapidly the currents developed in the coils of the latter will follow oneanother, and the more rapidly the motor will revolve in response thereto, andthis continues until the armature generator is stopped entirely, as by a brake,when the motor, if properly constructed, runs at the speed with which themagnetic poles of the generator rotate.The effective strength of the currents developed in the armature coils of thegenerator is dependent upon the strength of the currents energizing thegenerator and upon the number of rotations per unit of time of the magneticpoles of the generator; hence the speed of the motor armature will depend in allcases upon the relative speeds of the armature of the generator and of itsmagnetic poles. For example, if the poles are turned two thousand times per unitof time and the armature is turned eight hundred, the motor will turn twelvehundred times, or nearly so. Very slight differences of speed may be indicatedby a delicately balanced motor.Let it now be assumed that power is applied to the generator armature to turn itin a direction opposite to that in which its magnetic poles rotate. In such casethe result would be similar to that produced by a generator the armature andfield magnets of which are rotated in opposite directions, and by reason ofthese conditions the motor armature will turn at a rate of speed equal to thesum of the speeds of the armature and magnetic poles of the generator, so that acomparatively low speed of the generator armature will produce a high speed inthe motor.It will be observed in connection with this system that on diminishing theresistance of the external circuit of the generator armature by checking thespeed of the motor or by adding translating devices in multiple arc in thesecondary circuit or circuits of the transformer the strength of the current inthe armature circuit is greatly increased. This is due to two causes: first, tothe great differences in the speeds of the motor and generator, and, secondly,to the fact that the apparatus follows the analogy of a transformer, for, inproportion as the resistance of the armature or secondary circuits is reduced,the strength of the currents in the field or primary circuits of the generatoris increased and the currents in the armature are augmented correspondingly. Forsimilar reasons the currents in the armature-coils of the generator increasevery rapidly when the speed of the armature is reduced when running in the samedirection as the magnetic poles or conversely.It will be understood from the above description that the generator-armature maybe run in the direction of the shifting of the magnetic poles, but more rapidly,and that in such case the speed of the motor will be equal to the differencebetween the two rates."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VII [05_Contents.xhtml#r9]REGULATOR FOR ROTARY CURRENT MOTORS [05_Contents.xhtml#r9]An interesting device for regulating and reversing has been devised by Mr. Teslafor the purpose of varying the speed of polyphase motors. It consists of a formof converter or transformer with one element capable of movement with respect tothe other, whereby the inductive relations may be altered, either manually orautomatically, for the purpose of varying the strength of the induced current.Mr. Tesla prefers to construct this device in such manner that the induced orsecondary element may be movable with respect to the other; and the invention,so far as relates merely to the construction of the device itself, consists,essentially, in the combination, with two opposite magnetic poles, of anarmature wound with an insulated coil and mounted on a shaft, whereby it may beturned to the desired extent within the field produced by the poles. The normalposition of the core of the secondary element is that in which it mostcompletely closes the magnetic circuit between the poles of the primary element,and in this position its coil is in its most effective position for theinductive action upon it of the primary coils; but by turning the movable coreto either side, the induced currents delivered by its coil become weaker until,by a movement of the said core and coil through 90°, there will be no currentdelivered.Fig. 34 is a view in side elevation of the regulator. Fig. 35 is a brokensection on line x x of Fig. 34. Fig. 36 is a diagram illustrating the mostconvenient manner of applying the regulator to ordinary forms of motors, andFig. 37 is a similar diagram illustrating the application of the device to theTesla alternating-current motors. The regulator may be constructed in many waysto secure the desired result; but that which is, perhaps, its best form is shownin Figs. 34 and 35.images [images/fig34.jpg]FIG. 34.images [images/fig35.jpg]FIG. 35.images [images/fig36.jpg]FIG. 36.images [images/fig37.jpg]FIG. 37.A represents a frame of iron. B B are the cores of the inducing or primary coilsC C. D is a shaft mounted on the side bars, D′, and on which is secured asectional iron core, E, wound with an induced or secondary coil, F, theconvolutions of which are parallel with the axis of the shaft. The ends of thecore are rounded off so as to fit closely in the space between the two poles andpermit the core E to be turned to and held at any desired point. A handle, G,secured to the projecting end of the shaft D, is provided for this purpose.In Fig. 36 let H represent an ordinary alternating current generator, thefield-magnets of which are excited by a suitable source of current, I. Let Jdesignate an ordinary form of electromagnetic motor provided with an armature,K, commutator L, and field-magnets M. It is well known that such a motor, if itsfield-magnet cores be divided up into insulated sections, may be practicallyoperated by an alternating current; but in using this regulator with such amotor, Mr. Tesla includes one element of the motor only—say thearmature-coils—in the main circuit of the generator, making the connectionsthrough the brushes and the commutator in the usual way. He also includes one ofthe elements of the regulator—say the stationary coils—in the same circuit, andin the circuit with the secondary or movable coil of the regulator he connectsup the field-coils of the motor. He also prefers to use flexible conductors tomake the connections from the secondary coil of the regulator, as he therebyavoids the use of sliding contacts or rings without interfering with therequisite movement of the core E.If the regulator be in its normal position, or that in which its magneticcircuit is most nearly closed, it delivers its maximum induced current, thephases of which so correspond with those of the primary current that the motorwill run as though both field and armature were excited by the main current.To vary the speed of the motor to any rate between the minimum and maximumrates, the core E and coils F are turned in either direction to an extent whichproduces the desired result, for in its normal position the convolutions of coilF embrace the maximum number of lines of force, all of which act with the sameeffect upon the coil; hence it will deliver its maximum current; but by turningthe coil F out of its position of maximum effect the number of lines of forceembraced by it is diminished. The inductive effect is therefore impaired, andthe current delivered by coil F will continue to diminish in proportion to theangle at which the coil F is turned until, after passing through an angle ofninety degrees, the convolutions of the coil will be at right angles to those ofcoils C C, and the inductive effect reduced to a minimum.Incidentally to certain constructions, other causes may influence the variationin the strength of the induced currents. For example, in the present case itwill be observed that by the first movement of coil F a certain portion of itsconvolutions are carried beyond the line of the direct influence of the lines offorce, and that the magnetic path or circuit for the lines is impaired; hencethe inductive effect would be reduced. Next, that after moving through a certainangle, which is obviously determined by the relative dimensions of the bobbin orcoil F, diagonally opposite portions of the coil will be simultaneously includedin the field, but in such positions that the lines which produce acurrent-impulse in one portion of the coil in a certain direction will producein the diagonally opposite portion a corresponding impulse in the oppositedirection; hence portions of the current will neutralize one another.As before stated, the mechanical construction of the device may be greatlyvaried; but the essential conditions of the principle will be fulfilled in anyapparatus in which the movement of the elements with respect to one anothereffects the same results by varying the inductive relations of the two elementsin a manner similar to that described.It may also be stated that the core E is not indispensable to the operation ofthe regulator; but its presence is obviously beneficial. This regulator,however, has another valuable property in its capability of reversing the motor,for if the coil F be turned through a half-revolution, the position of itsconvolutions relatively to the two coils C C and to the lines of force isreversed, and consequently the phases of the current will be reversed. This willproduce a rotation of the motor in an opposite direction. This form of regulatoris also applied with great advantage to Mr. Tesla’s system of utilizingalternating currents, in which the magnetic poles of the field of a motor areprogressively shifted by means of the combined effects upon the field ofmagnetizing coils included in independent circuits, through which passalternating currents in proper order and relations to each other.In Fig. 37, let P represent a Tesla generator having two independent coils, P′and P″, on the armature, and T a diagram of a motor having two independentenergizing coils or sets of coils, R R′. One of the circuits from the generator,as S′ S′, includes one set, R′ R′, of the energizing coils of the motor, whilethe other circuit, as S S, includes the primary coils of the regulator. Thesecondary coil of the regulator includes the other coils, R R, of the motor.While the secondary coil of the regulator is in its normal position, it producesits maximum current, and the maximum rotary effect is imparted to the motor; butthis effect will be diminished in proportion to the angle at which the coil F ofthe regulator is turned. The motor will also be reversed by reversing theposition of the coil with reference to the coils C C, and thereby reversing thephases of the current produced by the generator. This changes the direction ofthe movement of the shifting poles which the armature follows.One of the main advantages of this plan of regulation is its economy of power.When the induced coil is generating its maximum current, the maximum amount ofenergy in the primary coils is absorbed; but as the induced coil is turned fromits normal position the self-induction of the primary-coils reduces theexpenditure of energy and saves power.It is obvious that in practice either coils C C or coil F may be used as primaryor secondary, and it is well understood that their relative proportions may bevaried to produce any desired difference or similarity in the inducing andinduced currents."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII [05_Contents.xhtml#r10]SINGLE CIRCUIT, SELF-STARTING SYNCHRONIZING MOTORS [05_Contents.xhtml#r10]In the first chapters of this section we have, bearing in mind the broadunderlying principle, considered a distinct class of motors, namely, such asrequire for their operation a special generator capable of yielding currents ofdiffering phase. As a matter of course, Mr. Tesla recognizing the desirabilityof utilizing his motors in connection with ordinary systems of distribution,addressed himself to the task of inventing various methods and ways of achievingthis object. In the succeeding chapters, therefore, we witness the evolution ofa number of ideas bearing upon this important branch of work. It must be obviousto a careful reader, from a number of hints encountered here and there, thateven the inventions described in these chapters to follow do not represent thefull scope of the work done in these lines. They might, indeed, be regarded asexemplifications.We will present these various inventions in the order which to us appears themost helpful to an understanding of the subject by the majority of readers. Itwill be naturally perceived that in offering a series of ideas of this nature,wherein some of the steps or links are missing, the descriptions are notaltogether sequential; but anyone who follows carefully the main drift of thethoughts now brought together will find that a satisfactory comprehension of theprinciples can be gained.As is well known, certain forms of alternating-current machines have theproperty, when connected in circuit with an alternating current generator, ofrunning as a motor in synchronism therewith; but, while the alternating currentwill run the motor after it has attained a rate of speed synchronous with thatof the generator, it will not start it. Hence, in all instances heretofore wherethese “synchronizing motors,” as they are termed, have been run, some means havebeen adopted to bring the motors up to synchronism with the generator, orapproximately so, before the alternating current of the generator is applied todrive them. In some instances mechanical appliances have been utilized for thispurpose. In others special and complicated forms of motor have been constructed.Mr. Tesla has discovered a much more simple method or plan of operatingsynchronizing motors, which requires practically no other apparatus than themotor itself. In other words, by a certain change in the circuit connections ofthe motor he converts it at will from a double circuit motor, or such as havebeen already described, and which will start under the action of an alternatingcurrent, into a synchronizing motor, or one which will be run by the generatoronly when it has reached a certain speed of rotation synchronous with that ofthe generator. In this manner he is enabled to extend very greatly theapplications of his system and to secure all the advantages of both forms ofalternating current motor.The expression “synchronous with that of the generator,” is used here in itsordinary acceptation—that is to say, a motor is said to synchronize with thegenerator when it preserves a certain relative speed determined by its number ofpoles and the number of alternations produced per revolution of the generator.Its actual speed, therefore, may be faster or slower than that of the generator;but it is said to be synchronous so long as it preserves the same relativespeed.In carrying out this invention Mr. Tesla constructs a motor which has a strongtendency to synchronism with the generator. The construction preferred is thatin which the armature is provided with polar projections. The field-magnets arewound with two sets of coils, the terminals of which are connected to a switchmechanism, by means of which the line-current may be carried directly throughthese coils or indirectly through paths by which its phases are modified. Tostart such a motor, the switch is turned on to a set of contacts which includesin one motor circuit a dead resistance, in the other an inductive resistance,and, the two circuits being in derivation, it is obvious that the difference inphase of the current in such circuits will set up a rotation of the motor. Whenthe speed of the motor has thus been brought to the desired rate the switch isshifted to throw the main current directly through the motor-circuits, andalthough the currents in both circuits will now be of the same phase the motorwill continue to revolve, becoming a true synchronous motor. To secure greaterefficiency, the armature or its polar projections are wound with coils closed onthemselves.In the accompanying diagrams, Fig. 38 illustrates the details of the plan aboveset forth, and Figs. 39 and 40 modifications of the same.images [images/fig38.jpg]FIGS. 38, 39 and 40.Referring to Fig. 38, let A designate the field-magnets of a motor, the polarprojections of which are wound with coils B C included in independent circuits,and D the armature with polar projections wound with coils E closed uponthemselves, the motor in these respects being similar in construction to thosedescribed already, but having on account of the polar projections on thearmature core, or other similar and well-known features, the properties of asynchronizing-motor. L L′ represents the conductors of a line from analternating current generator G.Near the motor is placed a switch the action of which is that of the one shownin the diagrams, which is constructed as follows: F F′ are two conducting platesor arms, pivoted at their ends and connected by an insulating cross-bar, H, soas to be shifted in parallelism. In the path of the bars F F′ is the contact 2,which forms one terminal of the circuit through coils C, and the contact 4,which is one terminal of the circuit through coils B. The opposite end of thewire of coils C is connected to the wire L or bar F′, and the corresponding endof coils B is connected to wire L′ and bar F; hence if the bars be shifted so asto bear on contacts 2 and 4 both sets of coils B C will be included in thecircuit L L′ in multiple arc or derivation. In the path of the levers F F′ aretwo other contact terminals, 1 and 3. The contact 1 is connected to contact 2through an artificial resistance, I, and contact 3 with contact 4 through aself-induction coil, J, so that when the switch levers are shifted upon thepoints 1 and 3 the circuits of coils B and C will be connected in multiple arcor derivation to the circuit L L′, and will include the resistance andself-induction coil respectively. A third position of the switch is that inwhich the levers F and F′ are shifted out of contact with both sets of points.In this case the motor is entirely out of circuit.The purpose and manner of operating the motor by these devices are as follows:The normal position of the switch, the motor being out of circuit, is off thecontact points. Assuming the generator to be running, and that it is desired tostart the motor, the switch is shifted until its levers rest upon points 1 and3. The two motor-circuits are thus connected with the generator circuit; but byreason of the presence of the resistance I in one and the self-induction coil Jin the other the coincidence of the phases of the current is disturbedsufficiently to produce a progression of the poles, which starts the motor inrotation. When the speed of the motor has run up to synchronism with thegenerator, or approximately so, the switch is shifted over upon the points 2 and4, thus cutting out the coils I and J, so that the currents in both circuitshave the same phase; but the motor now runs as a synchronous motor.It will be understood that when brought up to speed the motor will run with onlyone of the circuits B or C connected with the main or generator circuit, or thetwo circuits may be connected in series. This latter plan is preferable when acurrent having a high number of alternations per unit of time is employed todrive the motor. In such case the starting of the motor is more difficult, andthe dead and inductive resistances must take up a considerable proportion of theelectromotive force of the circuits. Generally the conditions are so adjustedthat the electromotive force used in each of the motor circuits is that which isrequired to operate the motor when its circuits are in series. The plan followedin this case is illustrated in Fig. 39. In this instance the motor has twelvepoles and the armature has polar projections D wound with closed coils E. Theswitch used is of substantially the same construction as that shown in theprevious figure. There are, however, five contacts, designated as 5, 6, 7, 8,and 9. The motor-circuits B C, which include alternate field-coils, areconnected to the terminals in the following order: One end of circuit C isconnected to contact 9 and to contact 5 through a dead resistance, I. Oneterminal of circuit B is connected to contact 7 and to contact 6 through aself-induction coil, J. The opposite terminals of both circuits are connected tocontact 8.One of the levers, as F, of the switch is made with an extension, f, orotherwise, so as to cover both contacts 5 and 6 when shifted into the positionto start the motor. It will be observed that when in this position and withlever F′ on contact 8 the current divides between the two circuits B C, whichfrom their difference in electrical character produce a progression of the polesthat starts the motor in rotation. When the motor has attained the proper speed,the switch is shifted so that the levers cover the contacts 7 and 9, therebyconnecting circuits B and C in series. It is found that by this disposition themotor is maintained in rotation in synchronism with the generator. Thisprinciple of operation, which consists in converting by a change of connectionsor otherwise a double-circuit motor, or one operating by a progressive shiftingof the poles, into an ordinary synchronizing motor may be carried out in manyother ways. For instance, instead of using the switch shown in the previousfigures, we may use a temporary ground circuit between the generator and motor,in order to start the motor, in substantially the manner indicated in Fig. 40.Let G in this figure represent an ordinary alternating-current generator with,say, two poles, M M′, and an armature wound with two coils, N N′, at rightangles and connected in series. The motor has, for example, four poles woundwith coils B C, which are connected in series, and an armature with polarprojections D wound with closed coils E E. From the common joint or unionbetween the two circuits of both the generator and the motor an earth connectionis established, while the terminals or ends of these circuits are connected tothe line. Assuming that the motor is a synchronizing motor or one that has thecapability of running in synchronism with the generator, but not of starting, itmay be started by the above-described apparatus by closing the ground connectionfrom both generator and motor. The system thus becomes one with a two-circuitgenerator and motor, the ground forming a common return for the currents in thetwo circuits L and L′. When by this arrangement of circuits the motor is broughtto speed, the ground connection is broken between the motor or generator, orboth, ground-switches P P′ being employed for this purpose. The motor then runsas a synchronizing motor.In describing the main features which constitute this invention illustrationshave necessarily been omitted of the appliances used in conjunction with theelectrical devices of similar systems—such, for instance, as driving-belts,fixed and loose pulleys for the motor, and the like; but these are matters wellunderstood.Mr. Tesla believes he is the first to operate electro-magnetic motors byalternating currents in any of the ways herein described—that is to say, byproducing a progressive movement or rotation of their poles or points ofgreatest magnetic attraction by the alternating currents until they have reacheda given speed, and then by the same currents producing a simple alternation oftheir poles, or, in other words, by a change in the order or character of thecircuit connections to convert a motor operating on one principle to oneoperating on another."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX [05_Contents.xhtml#r11]CHANGE FROM DOUBLE CURRENT TOSINGLE CURRENT MOTOR [05_Contents.xhtml#r11]A description is given elsewhere of a method of operating alternating currentmotors by first rotating their magnetic poles until they have attainedsynchronous speed, and then alternating the poles. The motor is thustransformed, by a simple change of circuit connections from one operated by theaction of two or more independent energizing currents to one operated either bya single current or by several currents acting as one. Another way of doing thiswill now be described.At the start the magnetic poles of one element or field of the motor areprogressively shifted by alternating currents differing in phase and passedthrough independent energizing circuits, and short circuit the coils of theother element. When the motor thus started reaches or passes the limit of speedsynchronous with the generator, Mr. Tesla connects up the coils previouslyshort-circuited with a source of direct current and by a change of the circuitconnections produces a simple alternation of the poles. The motor then continuesto run in synchronism with the generator. The motor here shown in Fig. 41 is oneof the ordinary forms, with field-cores either laminated or solid and with acylindrical laminated armature wound, for example, with the coils A B at rightangles. The shaft of the armature carries three collecting or contact rings C DE. (Shown, for better illustration, as of different diameters.)images [images/fig41.jpg]FIG. 41.One end of coil A connects to one ring, as C, and one end of coil B connectswith ring D. The remaining ends are connected to ring E. Collecting springs orbrushes F G H bear upon the rings and lead to the contacts of a switch, to bepresently described. The field-coils have their terminals in binding-posts K K,and may be either closed upon themselves or connected with a source of directcurrent L, by means of a switch M. The main or controlling switch has fivecontacts a b c d e and two levers f g, pivoted and connected by an insulatingcross-bar h, so as to move in parallelism. These levers are connected to theline wires from a source of alternating currents N. Contact a is connected tobrush G and coil B through a dead resistance R and wire P. Contact b isconnected with brush F and coil A through a self-induction coil S and wire O.Contacts c and e are connected to brushes G F, respectively, through the wires PO, and contact d is directly connected with brush H. The lever f has a widenedend, which may span the contacts a b. When in such position and with lever g oncontact d, the alternating currents divide between the two motor-coils, and byreason of their different self-induction a difference of current-phase isobtained that starts the motor in rotation. In starting, the field-coils areshort circuited.When the motor has attained the desired speed, the switch is shifted to theposition shown in dotted lines—that is to say, with the levers f g resting onpoints c e. This connects up the two armature coils in series, and the motorwill then run as a synchronous motor. The field-coils are thrown into circuitwith the direct current source when the main switch is shifted."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER X [05_Contents.xhtml#r12]MOTOR WITH “CURRENT LAG” ARTIFICIALLY SECURED [05_Contents.xhtml#r12]One of the general ways followed by Mr. Tesla in developing his rotary phasemotors is to produce practically independent currents differing primarily inphase and to pass these through the motor-circuits. Another way is to produce asingle alternating current, to divide it between the motor-circuits, and toeffect artificially a lag in one of these circuits or branches, as by giving tothe circuits different self-inductive capacity, and in other ways. In the formercase, in which the necessary difference of phase is primarily effected in thegeneration of currents, in some instances, the currents are passed through theenergizing coils of both elements of the motor—the field and armature; but afurther result or modification may be obtained by doing this under theconditions hereinafter specified in the case of motors in which the lag, asabove stated, is artificially secured.Figs. 42 to 47, inclusive, are diagrams of different ways in which the inventionis carried out; and Fig. 48, a side view of a form of motor used by Mr. Teslafor this purpose.images [images/fig42.jpg]FIGS. 42, 43 and 44.images [images/fig45.jpg]FIGS. 45, 46 and 47.images [images/fig48.jpg]FIG. 48.A B in Fig. 42 indicate the two energizing circuits of a motor, and C D twocircuits on the armature. Circuit or coil A is connected in series with circuitor coil C, and the two circuits B D are similarly connected. Between coils A andC is a contact-ring e, forming one terminal of the latter, and a brush a,forming one terminal of the former. A ring d and brush c similarly connect coilsB and D. The opposite terminals of the field-coils connect to one binding post hof the motor, and those of the armature coils are similarly connected to theopposite binding post i through a contact-ring f and brush g. Thus eachmotor-circuit while in derivation to the other includes one armature and onefield coil. These circuits are of different self-induction, and may be made soin various ways. For the sake of clearness, an artificial resistance R is shownin one of these circuits, and in the other a self-induction coil S. When analternating current is passed through this motor it divides between its twoenergizing-circuits. The higher self-induction of one circuit produces a greaterretardation or lag in the current therein than in the other. The difference ofphase between the two currents effects the rotation or shifting of the points ofmaximum magnetic effect that secures the rotation of the armature. In certainrespects this plan of including both armature and field coils in circuit is amarked improvement. Such a motor has a good torque at starting; yet it has alsoconsiderable tendency to synchronism, owing to the fact that when properlyconstructed the maximum magnetic effects in both armature and field coincide—acondition which in the usual construction of these motors with closed armaturecoils is not readily attained. The motor thus constructed exhibits too, a betterregulation of current from no load to load, and there is less difference betweenthe apparent and real energy expended in running it. The true synchronous speedof this form of motor is that of the generator when both are alike—that is tosay, if the number of the coils on the armature and on the field is x, the motorwill run normally at the same speed as a generator driving it if the number offield magnets or poles of the same be also x.Fig. 43 shows a somewhat modified arrangement of circuits. There is in this casebut one armature coil E, the winding of which maintains effects corresponding tothe resultant poles produced by the two field-circuits.Fig. 44 represents a disposition in which both armature and field are wound withtwo sets of coils, all in multiple arc to the line or main circuit. The armaturecoils are wound to correspond with the field-coils with respect to theirself-induction. A modification of this plan is shown in Fig. 45—that is to say,the two field coils and two armature coils are in derivation to themselves andin series with one another. The armature coils in this case, as in the previousfigure, are wound for different self-induction to correspond with the fieldcoils.Another modification is shown in Fig. 46. In this case only one armature-coil,as D, is included in the line-circuit, while the other, as C, isshort-circuited.In such a disposition as that shown in Fig. 43, or where only one armature-coilis employed, the torque on the start is somewhat reduced, while the tendency tosynchronism is somewhat increased. In such a disposition as shown in Fig. 46,the opposite conditions would exist. In both instances, however, there is theadvantage of dispensing with one contact-ring.In Fig. 46 the two field-coils and the armature-coil D are in multiple arc. InFig. 47 this disposition is modified, coil D being shown in series with the twofield-coils.Fig. 48 is an outline of the general form of motor in which this invention isembodied. The circuit connections between the armature and field coils are made,as indicated in the previous figures, through brushes and rings, which are notshown."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI [05_Contents.xhtml#r13]ANOTHER METHOD OF TRANSFORMATION FROMA TORQUE TO A SYNCHRONIZING MOTOR [05_Contents.xhtml#r13]In a preceding chapter we have described a method by which Mr. Teslaaccomplishes the change in his type of rotating field motor from a torque to asynchronizing motor. As will be observed, the desired end is there reached by achange in the circuit connections at the proper moment. We will now proceed todescribe another way of bringing about the same result. The principle involvedin this method is as follows:If an alternating current be passed through the field coils only of a motorhaving two energizing circuits of different self-induction and the armaturecoils be short-circuited, the motor will have a strong torque, but little or notendency to synchronism with the generator; but if the same current whichenergizes the field be passed also through the armature coils the tendency toremain in synchronism is very considerably increased. This is due to the factthat the maximum magnetic effects produced in the field and armature more nearlycoincide. On this principle Mr. Tesla constructs a motor having independentfield circuits of different self-induction, which are joined in derivation to asource of alternating currents. The armature is wound with one or more coils,which are connected with the field coils through contact rings and brushes, andaround the armature coils a shunt is arranged with means for opening or closingthe same. In starting this motor the shunt is closed around the armature coils,which will therefore be in closed circuit. When the current is directed throughthe motor, it divides between the two circuits (it is not necessary to considerany case where there are more than two circuits used), which, by reason of theirdifferent self-induction, secure a difference of phase between the two currentsin the two branches, that produces a shifting or rotation of the poles. By thealternations of current, other currents are induced in the closed—orshort-circuited—armature coils and the motor has a strong torque. When thedesired speed is reached, the shunt around the armature-coils is opened and thecurrent directed through both armature and field coils. Under these conditionsthe motor has a strong tendency to synchronism.In Fig. 49, A and B designate the field coils of the motor. As the circuitsincluding these coils are of different self-induction, this is represented by aresistance coil R in circuit with A, and a self-induction coil S in circuit withB. The same result may of course be secured by the winding of the coils. C isthe armature circuit, the terminals of which are rings a b. Brushes c d bear onthese rings and connect with the line and field circuits. D is the shunt orshort circuit around the armature. E is the switch in the shunt.images [images/fig49.jpg]FIGS. 49, 50 and 51.It will be observed that in such a disposition as is illustrated in Fig. 49, thefield circuits A and B being of different self-induction, there will always be agreater lag of the current in one than the other, and that, generally, thearmature phases will not correspond with either, but with the resultant of both.It is therefore important to observe the proper rule in winding the armature.For instance, if the motor have eight poles—four in each circuit—there will befour resultant poles, and hence the armature winding should be such as toproduce four poles, in order to constitute a true synchronizing motor.The diagram, Fig. 50, differs from the previous one only in respect to the orderof connections. In the present case the armature-coil, instead of being inseries with the field-coils, is in multiple arc therewith. The armature-windingmay be similar to that of the field—that is to say, the armature may have two ormore coils wound or adapted for different self-induction and adapted,preferably, to produce the same difference of phase as the field-coils. Onstarting the motor the shunt is closed around both coils. This is shown in Fig.51, in which the armature coils are F G. To indicate their different electricalcharacter, there are shown in circuit with them, respectively, the resistance R′and the self-induction coil S′. The two armature coils are in series with thefield-coils and the same disposition of the shunt or short-circuit D is used. Itis of advantage in the operation of motors of this kind to construct or wind thearmature in such manner that when short-circuited on the start it will have atendency to reach a higher speed than that which synchronizes with thegenerator. For example, a given motor having, say, eight poles should run, withthe armature coil short-circuited, at two thousand revolutions per minute tobring it up to synchronism. It will generally happen, however, that this speedis not reached, owing to the fact that the armature and field currents do notproperly correspond, so that when the current is passed through the armature(the motor not being quite up to synchronism) there is a liability that it willnot “hold on,” as it is termed. It is preferable, therefore, to so wind orconstruct the motor that on the start, when the armature coils areshort-circuited, the motor will tend to reach a speed higher than thesynchronous—as for instance, double the latter. In such case the difficultyabove alluded to is not felt, for the motor will always hold up to synchronismif the synchronous speed—in the case supposed of two thousand revolutions—isreached or passed. This may be accomplished in various ways; but for allpractical purposes the following will suffice: On the armature are wound twosets of coils. At the start only one of these is short-circuited, therebyproducing a number of poles on the armature, which will tend to run the speed upabove the synchronous limit. When such limit is reached or passed, the currentis directed through the other coil, which, by increasing the number of armaturepoles, tends to maintain synchronism.In Fig. 52, such a disposition is shown. The motor having, say, eight polescontains two field-circuits A and B, of different self-induction. The armaturehas two coils F and G. The former is closed upon itself, the latter connectedwith the field and line through contact-rings a b, brushes c d, and a switch E.On the start the coil F alone is active and the motor tends to run at a speedabove the synchronous; but when the coil G is connected to the circuit thenumber of armature poles is increased, while the motor is made a truesynchronous motor. This disposition has the advantage that the closedarmature-circuit imparts to the motor torque when the speed falls off, but atthe same time the conditions are such that the motor comes out of synchronismmore readily. To increase the tendency to synchronism, two circuits may be usedon the armature, one of which is short-circuited on the start and both connectedwith the external circuit after the synchronous speed is reached or passed. Thisdisposition is shown in Fig. 53. There are three contact-rings a b e and threebrushes c d f, which connect the armature circuits with the external circuit. Onstarting, the switch H is turned to complete the connection between onebinding-post P and the field-coils. This short-circuits one of thearmature-coils, as G. The other coil F is out of circuit and open. When themotor is up to speed, the switch H is turned back, so that the connection frombinding-post P to the field coils is through the coil G, and switch K is closed,thereby including coil F in multiple arc with the field coils. Both armaturecoils are thus active.images [images/fig52.jpg]FIG. 52.images [images/fig53.jpg]FIG. 53.From the above-described instances it is evident that many other dispositionsfor carrying out the invention are possible."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XII [05_Contents.xhtml#r14]“MAGNETIC LAG” MOTOR [05_Contents.xhtml#r14]The following description deals with another form of motor, namely, depending on“magnetic lag” or hysteresis, its peculiarity being that in it the attractiveeffects or phases while lagging behind the phases of current which produce them,are manifested simultaneously and not successively. The phenomenon utilized thusat an early stage by Mr. Tesla, was not generally believed in by scientific men,and Prof. Ayrton was probably first to advocate it or to elucidate the reason ofits supposed existence.Fig. 54 is a side view of the motor, in elevation. Fig. 55 is a part-sectionalview at right angles to Fig. 54. Fig. 56 is an end view in elevation and partsection of a modification, and Fig. 57 is a similar view of anothermodification.images [images/fig54.jpg]FIG. 54.images [images/fig55.jpg]FIG. 55.images [images/fig56.jpg]FIG. 56.images [images/fig57.jpg]FIG. 57.In Figs. 54 and 55, A designates a base or stand, and B B the supporting-frameof the motor. Bolted to the supporting-frame are two magnetic cores orpole-pieces C C′, of iron or soft steel. These may be subdivided or laminated,in which case hard iron or steel plates or bars should be used, or they shouldbe wound with closed coils. D is a circular disc armature, built up of sectionsor plates of iron and mounted in the frame between the pole-pieces C C′, curvedto conform to the circular shape thereof. This disc may be wound with a numberof closed coils E. F F are the main energizing coils, supported by thesupporting-frame, so as to include within their magnetizing influence both thepole-pieces C C′ and the armature D. The pole-pieces C C′ project out beyond thecoils F F on opposite sides, as indicated in the drawings. If an alternatingcurrent be passed through the coils F F, rotation of the armature will beproduced, and this rotation is explained by the following apparent action, ormode of operation: An impulse of current in the coils F F establishes twopolarities in the motor. The protruding end of pole-piece C, for instance, willbe of one sign, and the corresponding end of pole-piece C′ will be of theopposite sign. The armature also exhibits two poles at right angles to the coilsF F, like poles to those in the pole-pieces being on the same side of the coils.While the current is flowing there is no appreciable tendency to rotationdeveloped; but after each current impulse ceases or begins to fall, themagnetism in the armature and in the ends of the pole-pieces C C′ lags orcontinues to manifest itself, which produces a rotation of the armature by therepellent force between the more closely approximating points of maximummagnetic effect. This effect is continued by the reversal of current, thepolarities of field and armature being simply reversed. One or both of theelements—the armature or field—may be wound with closed induced coils tointensify this effect. Although in the illustrations but one of the fields isshown, each element of the motor really constitutes a field, wound with theclosed coils, the currents being induced mainly in those convolutions or coilswhich are parallel to the coils F F.A modified form of this motor is shown in Fig. 56. In this form G is one of twostandards that support the bearings for the armature-shaft. H H are uprights orsides of a frame, preferably magnetic, the ends C C′ of which are bent in themanner indicated, to conform to the shape of the armature D and formfield-magnet poles. The construction of the armature may be the same as in theprevious figure, or it may be simply a magnetic disc or cylinder, as shown, anda coil or coils F F are secured in position to surround both the armature andthe poles C C′. The armature is detachable from its shaft, the latter beingpassed through the armature after it has been inserted in position. Theoperation of this form of motor is the same in principle as that previouslydescribed and needs no further explanation.One of the most important features in alternating current motors is, however,that they should be adapted to and capable of running efficiently on thealternating circuits in present use, in which almost without exception thegenerators yield a very high number of alternations. Such a motor, of the typeunder consideration, Mr. Tesla has designed by a development of the principle ofthe motor shown in Fig. 56, making a multipolar motor, which is illustrated inFig. 57. In the construction of this motor he employs an annular magnetic frameJ, with inwardly-extending ribs or projections K, the ends of which all bend orturn in one direction and are generally shaped to conform to the curved surfaceof the armature. Coils F F are wound from one part K to the one next adjacent,the ends or loops of each coil or group of wires being carried over toward theshaft, so as to form U-shaped groups of convolutions at each end of thearmature. The pole-pieces C C′, being substantially concentric with thearmature, form ledges, along which the coils are laid and should project to someextent beyond the the coils, as shown. The cylindrical or drum armature D is ofthe same construction as in the other motors described, and is mounted to rotatewithin the annular frame J and between the U-shaped ends or bends of the coilsF. The coils F are connected in multiple or in series with a source ofalternating currents, and are so wound that with a current or current impulse ofgiven direction they will make the alternate pole-pieces C of one polarity andthe other pole-pieces C′ of the opposite polarity. The principle of theoperation of this motor is the same as the other above described, for,considering any two pole-pieces C C′, a current impulse passing in the coilwhich bridges them or is wound over both tends to establish polarities in theirends of opposite sign and to set up in the armature core between them a polarityof the same sign as that of the nearest pole-piece C. Upon the fall or cessationof the current impulse that established these polarities the magnetism whichlags behind the current phase, and which continues to manifest itself in thepolar projections C C′ and the armature, produces by repulsion a rotation of thearmature. The effect is continued by each reversal of the current. What occursin the case of one pair of pole-pieces occurs simultaneously in all, so that thetendency to rotation of the armature is measured by the sum of all the forcesexerted by the pole-pieces, as above described. In this motor also the magneticlag or effect is intensified by winding one or both cores with closed inducedcoils. The armature core is shown as thus wound. When closed coils are used, thecores should be laminated.It is evident that a pulsatory as well as an alternating current might be usedto drive or operate the motors above described.It will be understood that the degree of subdivision, the mass of the iron inthe cores, their size and the number of alternations in the current employed torun the motor, must be taken into consideration in order to properly constructthis motor. In other words, in all such motors the proper relations between thenumber of alternations and the mass, size, or quality of the iron must bepreserved in order to secure the best results."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIII [05_Contents.xhtml#r15]METHOD OF OBTAINING DIFFERENCEOF PHASE BY MAGNETIC SHIELDING [05_Contents.xhtml#r15]In that class of motors in which two or more sets of energizing magnets areemployed, and in which by artificial means a certain interval of time is made toelapse between the respective maximum or minimum periods or phases of theirmagnetic attraction or effect, the interval or difference in phase between thetwo sets of magnets is limited in extent. It is desirable, however, for theeconomical working of such motors that the strength or attraction of one set ofmagnets should be maximum, at the time when that of the other set is minimum,and conversely; but these conditions have not heretofore been realized except incases where the two currents have been obtained from independent sources in thesame or different machines. Mr. Tesla has therefore devised a motor embodyingconditions that approach more nearly the theoretical requirements of perfectworking, or in other words, he produces artificially a difference of magneticphase by means of a current from a single primary source sufficient in extent tomeet the requirements of practical and economical working. He employs a motorwith two sets of energizing or field magnets, each wound with coils connectedwith a source of alternating or rapidly-varying currents, but forming twoseparate paths or circuits. The magnets of one set are protected to a certainextent from the energizing action of the current by means of a magnetic shieldor screen interposed between the magnet and its energizing coil. This shield isproperly adapted to the conditions of particular cases, so as to shield orprotect the main core from magnetization until it has become itself saturatedand no longer capable of containing all the lines of force produced by thecurrent. It will be seen that by this means the energizing action begins in theprotected set of magnets a certain arbitrarily-determined period of time laterthan in the other, and that by this means alone or in conjunction with othermeans or devices heretofore employed a practical difference of magnetic phasemay readily be secured.Fig. 58 is a view of a motor, partly in section, with a diagram illustrating theinvention. Fig. 59 is a similar view of a modification of the same.images [images/fig58.jpg]FIG. 58.images [images/fig59.jpg]FIG. 59.In Fig. 58, which exhibits the simplest form of the invention, A A is thefield-magnet of a motor, having, say, eight poles or inwardly-projecting cores Band C. The cores B form one set of magnets and are energized by coils D. Thecores C, forming the other set are energized by coils E, and the coils areconnected, preferably, in series with one another, in two derived or branchedcircuits, F G, respectively, from a suitable source of current. Each coil E issurrounded by a magnetic shield H, which is preferably composed of an annealed,insulated, or oxidized iron wire wrapped or wound on the coils in the mannerindicated so as to form a closed magnetic circuit around the coils and betweenthe same and the magnetic cores C. Between the pole pieces or cores B C ismounted the armature K, which, as is usual in this type of machines, is woundwith coils L closed upon themselves. The operation resulting from thisdisposition is as follows: If a current impulse be directed through the twocircuits of the motor, it will quickly energize the cores B, but not so thecores C, for the reason that in passing through the coils E there is encounteredthe influence of the closed magnetic circuits formed by the shields H. The firsteffect is to retard effectively the current impulse in circuit G, while at thesame time the proportion of current which does pass does not magnetize the coresC, which are shielded or screened by the shields H. As the increasingelectromotive force then urges more current through the coils E, the iron wire Hbecomes magnetically saturated and incapable of carrying all the lines of force,and hence ceases to protect the cores C, which becomes magnetized, developingtheir maximum effect after an interval of time subsequent to the similarmanifestation of strength in the other set of magnets, the extent of which isarbitrarily determined by the thickness of the shield H, and otherwell-understood conditions.From the above it will be seen that the apparatus or device acts in two ways.First, by retarding the current, and, second, by retarding the magnetization ofone set of the cores, from which its effectiveness will readily appear.Many modifications of the principle of this invention are possible. One usefuland efficient application of the invention is shown in Fig. 59. In this figure amotor is shown similar in all respects to that above described, except that theiron wire H, which is wrapped around the coils E, is in this case connected inseries with the coils D. The iron-wire coils H, are connected and wound, so asto have little or no self-induction, and being added to the resistance of thecircuit F, the action of the current in that circuit will be accelerated, whilein the other circuit G it will be retarded. The shield H may be made in manyforms, as will be understood, and used in different ways, as appears from theforegoing description.As a modification of his type of motor with “shielded” fields, Mr. Tesla hasconstructed a motor with a field-magnet having two sets of poles orinwardly-projecting cores and placed side by side, so as practically to form twofields of force and alternately disposed—that is to say, with the poles of oneset or field opposite the spaces between the other. He then connects the freeends of one set of poles by means of laminated iron bands or bridge-pieces ofconsiderably smaller cross-section than the cores themselves, whereby the coreswill all form parts of complete magnetic circuits. When the coils on each set ofmagnets are connected in multiple circuits or branches from a source ofalternating currents, electromotive forces are set up in or impressed upon eachcircuit simultaneously; but the coils on the magnetically bridged or shuntedcores will have, by reason of the closed magnetic circuits, a highself-induction, which retards the current, permitting at the beginning of eachimpulse but little current to pass. On the other hand, no such opposition beingencountered in the other set of coils, the current passes freely through them,magnetizing the poles on which they are wound. As soon, however, as thelaminated bridges become saturated and incapable of carrying all the lines offorce which the rising electromotive force, and consequently increased current,produce, free poles are developed at the ends of the cores, which, acting inconjunction with the others, produce rotation of the armature.The construction in detail by which this invention is illustrated is shown inthe accompanying drawings.Fig. 60 is a view in side elevation of a motor embodying the principle. Fig. 61is a vertical cross-section of the motor. A is the frame of the motor, whichshould be built up of sheets of iron punched out to the desired shape and boltedtogether with insulation between the sheets. When complete, the frame makes afield-magnet with inwardly projecting pole-pieces B and C. To adapt them to therequirements of this particular case these pole-pieces are out of line with oneanother, those marked B surrounding one end of the armature and the others, asC, the opposite end, and they are disposed alternately—that is to say, thepole-pieces of one set occur in line with the spaces between those of the othersets.images [images/fig60.jpg]FIG. 60.images [images/fig61.jpg]FIG. 61.The armature D is of cylindrical form, and is also laminated in the usual wayand is wound longitudinally with coils closed upon themselves. The pole-pieces Care connected or shunted by bridge-pieces E. These may be made independently andattached to the pole-pieces, or they may be parts of the forms or blanks stampedor punched out of sheet-iron. Their size or mass is determined by variousconditions, such as the strength of the current to be employed, the mass or sizeof the cores to which they are applied, and other familiar conditions.Coils F surround the pole-pieces B, and other coils G are wound on thepole-pieces C. These coils are connected in series in two circuits, which arebranches of a circuit from a generator of alternating currents, and they may beso wound, or the respective circuits in which they are included may be soarranged, that the circuit of coils G will have, independently of the particularconstruction described, a higher self-induction than the other circuit orbranch.The function of the shunts or bridges E is that they shall form with the cores Ca closed magnetic circuit for a current up to a predetermined strength, so thatwhen saturated by such current and unable to carry more lines of force than sucha current produces they will to no further appreciable extent interfere with thedevelopment, by a stronger current, of free magnetic poles at the ends of thecores C.In such a motor the current is so retarded in the coils G, and the manifestationof the free magnetism in the poles C is so delayed beyond the period of maximummagnetic effect in poles B, that a strong torque is produced and the motoroperates with approximately the power developed in a motor of this kindenergized by independently generated currents differing by a full quarter phase."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIV [05_Contents.xhtml#r16]TYPE OF TESLA SINGLE-PHASE MOTOR [05_Contents.xhtml#r16]Up to this point, two principal types of Tesla motors have been described:First, those containing two or more energizing circuits through which are causedto pass alternating currents differing from one another in phase to an extentsufficient to produce a continuous progression or shifting of the poles orpoints of greatest magnetic effect, in obedience to which the movable element ofthe motor is maintained in rotation; second, those containing poles, or parts ofdifferent magnetic susceptibility, which under the energizing influence of thesame current or two currents coinciding in phase will exhibit differences intheir magnetic periods or phases. In the first class of motors the torque is dueto the magnetism established in different portions of the motor by currents fromthe same or from independent sources, and exhibiting time differences in phase.In the second class the torque results from the energizing effects of a currentupon different parts of the motor which differ in magnetic susceptibility—inother words, parts which respond in the same relative degree to the action of acurrent, not simultaneously, but after different intervals of time.In another Tesla motor, however, the torque, instead of being solely the resultof a time difference in the magnetic periods or phases of the poles orattractive parts to whatever cause due, is produced by an angular displacementof the parts which, though movable with respect to one another, are magnetizedsimultaneously, or approximately so, by the same currents. This principle ofoperation has been embodied practically in a motor in which the necessaryangular displacement between the points of greatest magnetic attraction in thetwo elements of the motor—the armature and field—is obtained by the direction ofthe lamination of the magnetic cores of the elements.Fig. 62 is a side view of such a motor with a portion of its armature coreexposed. Fig. 63 is an end or edge view of the same. Fig. 64 is a centralcross-section of the same, the armature being shown mainly in elevation.images [images/fig62.jpg]FIG. 62.images [images/fig63.jpg]FIG. 63.images [images/fig64.jpg]FIG. 64.Let A A designate two plates built up of thin sections or laminae of soft ironinsulated more or less from one another and held together by bolts a and securedto a base B. The inner faces of these plates contain recesses or grooves inwhich a coil or coils D are secured obliquely to the direction of thelaminations. Within the coils D is a disc E, preferably composed of aspirally-wound iron wire or ribbon or a series of concentric rings and mountedon a shaft F, having bearings in the plates A A. Such a device when acted uponby an alternating current is capable of rotation and constitutes a motor, theoperation of which may be explained in the following manner: A current orcurrent-impulse traversing the coils D tends to magnetize the cores A A and E,all of which are within the influence of the field of the coils. The poles thusestablished would naturally lie in the same line at right angles to the coils D,but in the plates A they are deflected by reason of the direction of thelaminations, and appear at or near the extremities of these plates. In the disc,however, where these conditions are not present, the poles or points of greatestattraction are on a line at right angles to the plane of the coils; hence therewill be a torque established by this angular displacement of the poles ormagnetic lines, which starts the disc in rotation, the magnetic lines of thearmature and field tending toward a position of parallelism. This rotation iscontinued and maintained by the reversals of the current in coils D D, whichchange alternately the polarity of the field-cores A A. This rotary tendency oreffect will be greatly increased by winding the disc with conductors G, closedupon themselves and having a radial direction, whereby the magnetic intensity ofthe poles of the disc will be greatly increased by the energizing effect of thecurrents induced in the coils G by the alternating currents in coils D.The cores of the disc and field may or may not be of different magneticsusceptibility—that is to say, they may both be of the same kind of iron, so asto be magnetized at approximately the same instant by the coils D; or one may beof soft iron and the other of hard, in order that a certain time may elapsebetween the periods of their magnetization. In either case rotation will beproduced; but unless the disc is provided with the closed energizing coils it isdesirable that the above-described difference of magnetic susceptibility beutilized to assist in its rotation.The cores of the field and armature may be made in various ways, as will be wellunderstood, it being only requisite that the laminations in each be in suchdirection as to secure the necessary angular displacement of the points ofgreatest attraction. Moreover, since the disc may be considered as made up of aninfinite number of radial arms, it is obvious that what is true of a disc holdsfor many other forms of armature."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XV [05_Contents.xhtml#r17]MOTORS WITH CIRCUITS OF DIFFERENT RESISTANCE [05_Contents.xhtml#r17]As has been pointed out elsewhere, the lag or retardation of the phases of analternating current is directly proportional to the self-induction and inverselyproportional to the resistance of the circuit through which the current flows.Hence, in order to secure the proper differences of phase between the twomotor-circuits, it is desirable to make the self-induction in one much higherand the resistance much lower than the self-induction and resistance,respectively, in the other. At the same time the magnetic quantities of the twopoles or sets of poles which the two circuits produce should be approximatelyequal. These requirements have led Mr. Tesla to the invention of a motor havingthe following general characteristics: The coils which are included in thatenergizing circuit which is to have the higher self-induction are made of coarsewire, or a conductor of relatively low resistance, and with the greatestpossible length or number of turns. In the other set of coils a comparativelyfew turns of finer wire are used, or a wire of higher resistance. Furthermore,in order to approximate the magnetic quantities of the poles excited by thesecoils, Mr. Tesla employs in the self-induction circuit cores much longer thanthose in the other or resistance circuit.Fig. 65 is a part sectional view of the motor at right angles to the shaft. Fig.66 is a diagram of the field circuits.images [images/fig65.jpg]FIG. 65.images [images/fig66.jpg]FIG. 66.In Fig. 66, let A represent the coils in one motor circuit, and B those in theother. The circuit A is to have the higher self-induction. There are, therefore,used a long length or a large number of turns of coarse wire in forming thecoils of this circuit. For the circuit B, a smaller conductor is employed, or aconductor of a higher resistance than copper, such as German silver or iron, andthe coils are wound with fewer turns. In applying these coils to a motor, Mr.Tesla builds up a field-magnet of plates C, of iron and steel, secured togetherin the usual manner by bolts D. Each plate is formed with four (more or less)long cores E, around which is a space to receive the coil and an equal number ofshort projections F to receive the coils of the resistance-circuit. The platesare generally annular in shape, having an open space in the center for receivingthe armature G, which Mr. Tesla prefers to wind with closed coils. Analternating current divided between the two circuits is retarded as to itsphases in the circuit A to a much greater extent than in the circuit B. Byreason of the relative sizes and disposition of the cores and coils the magneticeffect of the poles E and F upon the armature closely approximate.An important result secured by the construction shown here is that these coilswhich are designed to have the higher self-induction are almost completelysurrounded by iron, and that the retardation is thus very materially increased."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVI [05_Contents.xhtml#r18]MOTOR WITH EQUAL MAGNETIC ENERGIESIN FIELD AND ARMATURE [05_Contents.xhtml#r18]Let it be assumed that the energy as represented in the magnetism in the fieldof a given rotating field motor is ninety and that of the armature ten. The sumof these quantities, which represents the total energy expended in driving themotor, is one hundred; but, assuming that the motor be so constructed that theenergy in the field is represented by fifty, and that in the armature by fifty,the sum is still one hundred; but while in the first instance the product isnine hundred, in the second it is two thousand five hundred, and as the energydeveloped is in proportion to these products it is clear that those motors arethe most efficient—other things being equal—in which the magnetic energiesdeveloped in the armature and field are equal. These results Mr. Tesla obtainsby using the same amount of copper or ampere turns in both elements when thecores of both are equal, or approximately so, and the same current energizesboth; or in cases where the currents in one element are induced to those of theother he uses in the induced coils an excess of copper over that in the primaryelement or conductor.The conventional figure of a motor here introduced, Fig. 67, will give an ideaof the solution furnished by Mr. Tesla for the specific problem. Referring tothe drawing, A is the field-magnet, B the armature, C the field coils, and D thearmature-coils of the motor.images [images/fig67.jpg]FIG. 67.Generally speaking, if the mass of the cores of armature and field be equal, theamount of copper or ampere turns of the energizing coils on both should also beequal; but these conditions will be modified in different forms of machine. Itwill be understood that these results are most advantageous when existing underthe conditions presented where the motor is running with its normal load, apoint to be well borne in mind."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVII [05_Contents.xhtml#r19]MOTORS WITH COINCIDING MAXIMA OFMAGNETIC EFFECT IN ARMATURE AND FIELD [05_Contents.xhtml#r19]In this form of motor, Mr. Tesla’s object is to design and build machineswherein the maxima of the magnetic effects of the armature and field will morenearly coincide than in some of the types previously under consideration. Thesetypes are: First, motors having two or more energizing circuits of the sameelectrical character, and in the operation of which the currents used differprimarily in phase; second, motors with a plurality of energizing circuits ofdifferent electrical character, in or by means of which the difference of phaseis produced artificially, and, third, motors with a plurality of energizingcircuits, the currents in one being induced from currents in another.Considering the structural and operative conditions of any one of them—as, forexample, that first named—the armature which is mounted to rotate in obedienceto the co-operative influence or action of the energizing circuits has coilswound upon it which are closed upon themselves and in which currents are inducedby the energizing-currents with the object and result of energizing thearmature-core; but under any such conditions as must exist in these motors, itis obvious that a certain time must elapse between the manifestations of anenergizing current impulse in the field coils, and the corresponding magneticstate or phase in the armature established by the current induced thereby;consequently a given magnetic influence or effect in the field which is thedirect result of a primary current impulse will have become more or lessweakened or lost before the corresponding effect in the armature indirectlyproduced has reached its maximum. This is a condition unfavorable to efficientworking in certain cases—as, for instance, when the progress of the resultantpoles or points of maximum attraction is very great, or when a very high numberof alternations is employed—for it is apparent that a stronger tendency torotation will be maintained if the maximum magnetic attractions or conditions inboth armature and field coincide, the energy developed by a motor being measuredby the product of the magnetic quantities of the armature and field.To secure this coincidence of maximum magnetic effects, Mr. Tesla has devisedvarious means, as explained below. Fig. 68 is a diagrammatic illustration of aTesla motor system in which the alternating currents proceed from independentsources and differ primarily in phase.images [images/fig68.jpg]FIG. 68.A designates the field-magnet or magnetic frame of the motor; B B, oppositelylocated pole-pieces adapted to receive the coils of one energizing circuit; andC C, similar pole-pieces for the coils of the other energizing circuit. Thesecircuits are designated, respectively, by D E, the conductor D″ forming a commonreturn to the generator G. Between these poles is mounted an armature—forexample, a ring or annular armature, wound with a series of coils F, forming aclosed circuit or circuits. The action or operation of a motor thus constructedis now well understood. It will be observed, however, that the magnetism ofpoles B, for example, established by a current impulse in the coils thereon,precedes the magnetic effect set up in the armature by the induced current incoils F. Consequently the mutual attraction between the armature and field-polesis considerably reduced. The same conditions will be found to exist if, insteadof assuming the poles B or C as acting independently, we regard the idealresultant of both acting together, which is the real condition. To remedy this,the motor field is constructed with secondary poles B′ C′, which are situatedbetween the others. These pole-pieces are wound with coils D′ E′, the former inderivation to the coils D, the latter to coils E. The main or primary coils Dand E are wound for a different self-induction from that of the coils D′ and E′,the relations being so fixed that if the currents in D and E differ, forexample, by a quarter-phase, the currents in each secondary coil, as D′ E′, willdiffer from those in its appropriate primary D or E by, say, forty-five degrees,or one-eighth of a period.Now, assuming that an impulse or alternation in circuit or branch E is justbeginning, while in the branch D it is just falling from maximum, the conditionsare those of a quarter-phase difference. The ideal resultant of the attractiveforces of the two sets of poles B C therefore may be considered as progressingfrom poles B to poles C, while the impulse in E is rising to maximum, and thatin D is falling to zero or minimum. The polarity set up in the armature,however, lags behind the manifestations of field magnetism, and hence themaximum points of attraction in armature and field, instead of coinciding, areangularly displaced. This effect is counteracted by the supplemental poles B′C′. The magnetic phases of these poles succeed those of poles B C by the same,or nearly the same, period of time as elapses between the effect of the poles BC and the corresponding induced effect in the armature; hence the magneticconditions of poles B′ C′ and of the armature more nearly coincide and a betterresult is obtained. As poles B′ C′ act in conjunction with the poles in thearmature established by poles B C, so in turn poles C B act similarly with thepoles set up by B′ C′, respectively. Under such conditions the retardation ofthe magnetic effect of the armature and that of the secondary poles will bringthe maximum of the two more nearly into coincidence and a correspondinglystronger torque or magnetic attraction secured.In such a disposition as is shown in Fig. 68 it will be observed that as theadjacent pole-pieces of either circuit are of like polarity they will have acertain weakening effect upon one another. Mr. Tesla therefore prefers to removethe secondary poles from the direct influence of the others. This may be done byconstructing a motor with two independent sets of fields, and with either one ortwo armatures electrically connected, or by using two armatures and one field.These modifications are illustrated further on.Fig. 69 is a diagrammatic illustration of a motor and system in which thedifference of phase is artificially produced. There are two coils D D in onebranch and two coils E E in another branch of the main circuit from thegenerator G. These two circuits or branches are of different self-induction,one, as D, being higher than the other. This is graphically indicated by makingcoils D much larger than coils E. By reason of the difference in the electricalcharacter of the two circuits, the phases of current in one are retarded to agreater extent than the other. Let this difference be thirty degrees. A motorthus constructed will rotate under the action of an alternating current; but ashappens in the case previously described the corresponding magnetic effects ofthe armature and field do not coincide owing to the time that elapses between agiven magnetic effect in the armature and the condition of the field thatproduces it. The secondary or supplemental poles B′ C′ are therefore availed of.There being thirty degrees difference of phase between the currents in coils DE, the magnetic effect of poles B′ C′ should correspond to that produced by acurrent differing from the current in coils D or E by fifteen degrees. This wecan attain by winding each supplemental pole B′ C′ with two coils H H′. Thecoils H are included in a derived circuit having the same self-induction ascircuit D, and coils H′ in a circuit having the same self-induction as circuitE, so that if these circuits differ by thirty degrees the magnetism of poles B′C′ will correspond to that produced by a current differing from that in either Dor E by fifteen degrees. This is true in all other cases. For example, if inFig. 68 the coils D′ E′ be replaced by the coils H H′ included in the derivedcircuits, the magnetism of the poles B′ C′ will correspond in effect or phase,if it may be so termed, to that produced by a current differing from that ineither circuit D or E by forty-five degrees, or one-eighth of a period.images [images/fig69.jpg]FIG. 69.This invention as applied to a derived circuit motor is illustrated in Figs. 70and 71. The former is an end view of the motor with the armature in section anda diagram of connections, and Fig. 71 a vertical section through the field.These figures are also drawn to show one of the dispositions of two fields thatmay be adopted in carrying out the principle. The poles B B C C are in onefield, the remaining poles in the other. The former are wound with primary coilsI J and secondary coils I′ J′, the latter with coils K L. The primary coils I Jare in derived circuits, between which, by reason of their differentself-induction, there is a difference of phase, say, of thirty degrees. Thecoils I′ K are in circuit with one another, as also are coils J′ L, and thereshould be a difference of phase between the currents in coils K and L and theircorresponding primaries of, say, fifteen degrees. If the poles B C are at rightangles, the armature-coils should be connected directly across, or a singlearmature core wound from end to end may be used; but if the poles B C be in linethere should be an angular displacement of the armature coils, as will be wellunderstood.images [images/fig70.jpg]FIG. 70.images [images/fig71.jpg]FIG. 71.The operation will be understood from the foregoing. The maximum magneticcondition of a pair of poles, as B′ B′, coincides closely with the maximumeffect in the armature, which lags behind the corresponding condition in poles BB."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVIII [05_Contents.xhtml#r20]MOTOR BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE OF PHASEIN THE MAGNETIZATION OF THE INNER ANDOUTER PARTS OF AN IRON CORE [05_Contents.xhtml#r20]It is well known that if a magnetic core, even if laminated or subdivided, bewound with an insulated coil and a current of electricity be directed throughthe coil, the magnetization of the entire core does not immediately ensue, themagnetizing effect not being exhibited in all parts simultaneously. This may beattributed to the fact that the action of the current is to energize first thoselaminae or parts of the core nearest the surface and adjacent to theexciting-coil, and from thence the action progresses toward the interior. Acertain interval of time therefore elapses between the manifestation ofmagnetism in the external and the internal sections or layers of the core. Ifthe core be thin or of small mass, this effect may be inappreciable; but in thecase of a thick core, or even of a comparatively thin one, if the number ofalternations or rate of change of the current strength be very great, the timeinterval occurring between the manifestations of magnetism in the interior ofthe core and in those parts adjacent to the coil is more marked. In theconstruction of such apparatus as motors which are designed to be run byalternating or equivalent currents—such as pulsating or undulating currentsgenerally—Mr. Tesla found it desirable and even necessary to give dueconsideration to this phenomenon and to make special provisions in order toobviate its consequences. With the specific object of taking advantage of thisaction or effect, and to render it more pronounced, he constructs a field magnetin which the parts of the core or cores that exhibit at different intervals oftime the magnetic effect imparted to them by alternating or equivalent currentsin an energizing coil or coils, are so placed with relation to a rotatingarmature as to exert thereon their attractive effect successively in the orderof their magnetization. By this means he secures a result similar to that whichhe had previously attained in other forms or types of motor in which by means ofone or more alternating currents he has produced the rotation or progression ofthe magnetic poles.This new mode of operation will now be described. Fig. 72 is a side elevation ofsuch motor. Fig. 73 is a side elevation of a more practicable and efficientembodiment of the invention. Fig. 74 is a central vertical section of the samein the plane of the axis of rotation.images [images/fig72.jpg]images [images/fig73.jpg]FIGS. 72 and 73.images [images/fig74.jpg]FIG. 74.Referring to Fig. 72, let X represent a large iron core, which may be composedof a number of sheets or laminae of soft iron or steel. Surrounding this core isa coil Y, which is connected with a source E of rapidly varying currents. Let usconsider now the magnetic conditions existing in this core at any point, as b,at or near the center, and any other point, as a, nearer the surface. When acurrent impulse is started in the magnetizing coil Y, the section or part at a,being close to the coil, is immediately energized, while the section or part atb, which, to use a convenient expression, is “protected” by the interveningsections or layers between a and b, does not at once exhibit its magnetism.However, as the magnetization of a increases, b becomes also affected, reachingfinally its maximum strength some time later than a. Upon the weakening of thecurrent the magnetization of a first diminishes, while b still exhibits itsmaximum strength; but the continued weakening of a is attended by a subsequentweakening of b. Assuming the current to be an alternating one, a will now bereversed, while b still continues of the first imparted polarity. This actioncontinues the magnetic condition of b, following that of a in the manner abovedescribed. If an armature—for instance, a simple disc F, mounted to rotatefreely on an axis—be brought into proximity to the core, a movement of rotationwill be imparted to the disc, the direction depending upon its positionrelatively to the core, the tendency being to turn the portion of the discnearest to the core from a to b, as indicated in Fig. 72.This action or principle of operation has been embodied in a practicable form ofmotor, which is illustrated in Fig. 73. Let A in that figure represent acircular frame of iron, from diametrically opposite points of the interior ofwhich the cores project. Each core is composed of three main parts B, B and C,and they are similarly formed with a straight portion or body e, around whichthe energizing coil is wound, a curved arm or extension c, and an inwardlyprojecting pole or end d. Each core is made up of two parts B B, with theirpolar extensions reaching in one direction, and a part C between the other two,and with its polar extension reaching in the opposite direction. In order tolessen in the cores the circulation of currents induced therein, the severalsections are insulated from one another in the manner usually followed in suchcases. These cores are wound with coils D, which are connected in the samecircuit, either in parallel or series, and supplied with an alternating or apulsating current, preferably the former, by a generator E, representeddiagrammatically. Between the cores or their polar extensions is mounted acylindrical or similar armature F, wound with magnetizing coils G, closed uponthemselves.The operation of this motor is as follows: When a current impulse or alternationis directed through the coils D, the sections B B of the cores, being on thesurface and in close proximity to the coils, are immediately energized. Thesections C, on the other hand, are protected from the magnetizing influence ofthe coil by the interposed layers of iron B B. As the magnetism of B Bincreases, however, the sections C are also energized; but they do not attaintheir maximum strength until a certain time subsequent to the exhibition by thesections B B of their maximum. Upon the weakening of the current the magneticstrength of B B first diminishes, while the sections C have still their maximumstrength; but as B B continue to weaken the interior sections are similarlyweakened. B B may then begin to exhibit an opposite polarity, which is followedlater by a similar change on C, and this action continues. B B and C maytherefore be considered as separate field-magnets, being extended so as to acton the armature in the most efficient positions, and the effect is similar tothat in the other forms of Tesla motor—viz., a rotation or progression of themaximum points of the field of force. Any armature—such, for instance, as adisc—mounted in this field would rotate from the pole first to exhibit itsmagnetism to that which exhibits it later.It is evident that the principle here described may be carried out inconjunction with other means for securing a more favorable or efficient actionof the motor. For example, the polar extensions of the sections C may be woundor surrounded by closed coils. The effect of these coils will be to still moreeffectively retard the magnetization of the polar extensions of C."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIX [05_Contents.xhtml#r21]ANOTHER TYPE OF TESLA INDUCTION MOTOR [05_Contents.xhtml#r21]It will have been gathered by all who are interested in the advance of theelectrical arts, and who follow carefully, step by step, the work of pioneers,that Mr. Tesla has been foremost to utilize inductive effects in permanentlyclosed circuits, in the operation of alternating motors. In this chapter onesimple type of such a motor is described and illustrated, which will serve as anexemplification of the principle.Let it be assumed that an ordinary alternating current generator is connected upin a circuit of practically no self-induction, such, for example, as a circuitcontaining incandescent lamps only. On the operation of the machine, alternatingcurrents will be developed in the circuit, and the phases of these currents willtheoretically coincide with the phases of the impressed electromotive force.Such currents may be regarded and designated as the “unretarded currents.”It will be understood, of course, that in practice there is always more or lessself-induction in the circuit, which modifies to a corresponding extent theseconditions; but for convenience this may be disregarded in the consideration ofthe principle of operation, since the same laws apply. Assume next that a pathof currents be formed across any two points of the above circuit, consisting,for example, of the primary of an induction device. The phases of the currentspassing through the primary, owing to the self-induction of the same, will notcoincide with the phases of the impressed electromotive force, but will lagbehind, such lag being directly proportional to the self-induction and inverselyproportional to the resistance of the said coil. The insertion of this coil willalso cause a lagging or retardation of the currents traversing and delivered bythe generator behind the impressed electromotive force, such lag being the meanor resultant of the lag of the current through the primary alone and of the“unretarded current” in the entire working circuit. Next consider the conditionsimposed by the association in inductive relation with the primary coil, of asecondary coil. The current generated in the secondary coil will react upon theprimary current, modifying the retardation of the same, according to the amountof self-induction and resistance in the secondary circuit. If the secondarycircuit has but little self-induction—as, for instance, when it containsincandescent lamps only—it will increase the actual difference of phase betweenits own and the primary current, first, by diminishing the lag between theprimary current and the impressed electromotive force, and, second, by its ownlag or retardation behind the impressed electromotive force. On the other hand,if the secondary circuit have a high self-induction, its lag behind the currentin the primary is directly increased, while it will be still further increasedif the primary have a very low self-induction. The better results are obtainedwhen the primary has a low self-induction.Fig. 75 is a diagram of a Tesla motor embodying this principle. Fig. 76 is asimilar diagram of a modification of the same. In Fig. 75 let A designate thefield-magnet of a motor which, as in all these motors, is built up of sectionsor plates. B C are polar projections upon which the coils are wound. Upon onepair of these poles, as C, are wound primary coils D, which are directlyconnected to the circuit of an alternating current generator G. On the samepoles are also wound secondary coils F, either side by side or over or under theprimary coils, and these are connected with other coils E, which surround thepoles B B. The currents in both primary and secondary coils in such a motor willbe retarded or will lag behind the impressed electromotive force; but to securea proper difference in phase between the primary and secondary currentsthemselves, Mr. Tesla increases the resistance of the circuit of the secondaryand reduces as much as practicable its self-induction. This is done by using forthe secondary circuit, particularly in the coils E, wire of comparatively smalldiameter and having but few turns around the cores; or by using some conductorof higher specific resistance, such as German silver; or by introducing at somepoint in the secondary circuit an artificial resistance R. Thus theself-induction of the secondary is kept down and its resistance increased, withthe result of decreasing the lag between the impressed electro-motive force andthe current in the primary coils and increasing the difference of phase betweenthe primary and secondary currents.images [images/fig75.jpg]FIG. 75.images [images/fig76.jpg]FIG. 76.In the disposition shown in Fig. 76, the lag in the secondary is increased byincreasing the self-induction of that circuit, while the increasing tendency ofthe primary to lag is counteracted by inserting therein a dead resistance. Theprimary coils D in this case have a low self-induction and high resistance,while the coils E F, included in the secondary circuit, have a highself-induction and low resistance. This may be done by the proper winding of thecoils; or in the circuit including the secondary coils E F, we may introduce aself-induction coil S, while in the primary circuit from the generator G andincluding coils D, there may be inserted a dead resistance R. By this means thedifference of phase between the primary and secondary is increased. It isevident that both means of increasing the difference of phase—namely, by thespecial winding as well as by the supplemental or external inductive and deadresistance—may be employed conjointly.In the operation of this motor the current impulses in the primary coils inducecurrents in the secondary coils, and by the conjoint action of the two thepoints of greatest magnetic attraction are shifted or rotated.In practice it is found desirable to wind the armature with closed coils inwhich currents are induced by the action thereon of the primaries."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XX [05_Contents.xhtml#r22]COMBINATIONS OF SYNCHRONIZING MOTORAND TORQUE MOTOR [05_Contents.xhtml#r22]In the preceding descriptions relative to synchronizing motors and methods ofoperating them, reference has been made to the plan adopted by Mr. Tesla, whichconsists broadly in winding or arranging the motor in such manner that by meansof suitable switches it could be started as a multiple-circuit motor, or oneoperating by a progression of its magnetic poles, and then, when up to speed, ornearly so, converted into an ordinary synchronizing motor, or one in which themagnetic poles were simply alternated. In some cases, as when a large motor isused and when the number of alternations is very high, there is more or lessdifficulty in bringing the motor to speed as a double or multiple-circuit motor,for the plan of construction which renders the motor best adapted to run as asynchronizing motor impairs its efficiency as a torque or double-circuit motorunder the assumed conditions on the start. This will be readily understood, forin a large synchronizing motor the length of the magnetic circuit of the polarprojections, and their mass, are so great that apparently considerable time isrequired for magnetization and demagnetization. Hence with a current of a veryhigh number of alternations the motor may not respond properly. To avoid thisobjection and to start up a synchronizing motor in which these conditionsobtain, Mr. Tesla has combined two motors, one a synchronizing motor, the othera multiple-circuit or torque motor, and by the latter he brings the first-namedup to speed, and then either throws the whole current into the synchronizingmotor or operates jointly both of the motors.This invention involves several novel and useful features. It will be observed,in the first place, that both motors are run, without commutators of any kind,and, secondly, that the speed of the torque motor may be higher than that of thesynchronizing motor, as will be the case when it contains a fewer number ofpoles or sets of poles, so that the motor will be more readily and easilybrought up to speed. Thirdly, the synchronizing motor may be constructed so asto have a much more pronounced tendency to synchronism without lessening thefacility with which it is started.Fig. 77 is a part sectional view of the two motors; Fig. 78 an end view of thesynchronizing motor; Fig. 79 an end view and part section of the torque ordouble-circuit motor; Fig. 80 a diagram of the circuit connections employed; andFigs. 81, 82, 83, 84 and 85 are diagrams of modified dispositions of the twomotors.images [images/fig77.jpg]FIG. 77.images [images/fig78.jpg]FIG. 78.images [images/fig79.jpg]FIG. 79.images [images/fig80.jpg]FIG. 80.images [images/fig81.jpg]FIGS. 81, 82, 83, 84 and 85.Inasmuch as neither motor is doing any work while the current is acting upon theother, the two armatures are rigidly connected, both being mounted upon the sameshaft A, the field-magnets B of the synchronizing and C of the torque motorbeing secured to the same base D. The preferably larger synchronizing motor haspolar projections on its armature, which rotate in very close proximity to thepoles of the field, and in other respects it conforms to the conditions that arenecessary to secure synchronous action. The pole-pieces of the armature are,however, wound with closed coils E, as this obviates the employment of slidingcontacts. The smaller or torque motor, on the other hand, has, preferably, acylindrical armature F, without polar projections and wound with closed coils G.The field-coils of the torque motor are connected up in two series H and I, andthe alternating current from the generator is directed through or dividedbetween these two circuits in any manner to produce a progression of the polesor points of maximum magnetic effect. This result is secured by connecting thetwo motor-circuits in derivation with the circuit from the generator, insertingin one motor circuit a dead resistance and in the other a self-induction coil,by which means a difference in phase between the two divisions of the current issecured. If both motors have the same number of field poles, the torque motorfor a given number of alternations will tend to run at double the speed of theother, for, assuming the connections to be such as to give the best results, itspoles are divided into two series and the number of poles is virtually reducedone-half, which being acted upon by the same number of alternations tend torotate the armature at twice the speed. By this means the main armature is moreeasily brought to or above the required speed. When the speed necessary forsynchronism is imparted to the main motor, the current is shifted from thetorque motor into the other.A convenient arrangement for carrying out this invention is shown in Fig. 80, inwhich J J are the field coils of the synchronizing, and H I the field coils ofthe torque motor. L L′ are the conductors of the main line. One end of, say,coils H is connected to wire L through a self-induction coil M. One end of theother set of coils I is connected to the same wire through a dead resistance N.The opposite ends of these two circuits are connected to the contact m of aswitch, the handle or lever of which is in connection with the line-wire L′. Oneend of the field circuit of the synchronizing motor is connected to the wire L.The other terminates in the switch-contact n. From the diagram it will bereadily seen that if the lever P be turned upon contact m, the torque motor willstart by reason of the difference of phase between the currents in its twoenergizing circuits. Then when the desired speed is attained, if the lever P beshifted upon contact n the entire current will pass through the field coils ofthe synchronizing motor and the other will be doing no work.The torque motor may be constructed and operated in various ways, many of whichhave already been touched upon. It is not necessary that one motor be cut out ofcircuit while the other is in, for both may be acted upon by current at the sametime, and Mr. Tesla has devised various dispositions or arrangements of the twomotors for accomplishing this. Some of these arrangements are illustrated inFigs. 81 to 85.Referring to Fig. 81, let T designate the torque or multiple circuit motor and Sthe synchronizing motor, L L′ being the line-wires from a source of alternatingcurrent. The two circuits of the torque motor of different degrees ofself-induction, and designated by N M, are connected in derivation to the wireL. They are then joined and connected to the energizing circuit of thesynchronizing motor, the opposite terminal of which is connected to wire L′. Thetwo motors are thus in series. To start them Mr. Tesla short-circuits thesynchronizing motor by a switch P′, throwing the whole current through thetorque motor. Then when the desired speed is reached the switch P′ is opened, sothat the current passes through both motors. In such an arrangement as this itis obviously desirable for economical and other reasons that a proper relationbetween the speeds of the two motors should be observed.In Fig. 82 another disposition is illustrated. S is the synchronizing motor andT the torque motor, the circuits of both being in parallel. W is a circuit alsoin derivation to the motor circuits and containing a switch P″. S′ is a switchin the synchronizing motor circuit. On the start the switch S′ is opened,cutting out the motor S. Then P″ is opened, throwing the entire current throughthe motor T, giving it a very strong torque. When the desired speed is reached,switch S′ is closed and the current divides between both motors. By means ofswitch P″ both motors may be cut out.In Fig. 83 the arrangement is substantially the same, except that a switch T′ isplaced in the circuit which includes the two circuits of the torque motor. Fig.84 shows the two motors in series, with a shunt around both containing a switchS T. There is also a shunt around the synchronizing motor S, with a switch P′.In Fig. 85 the same disposition is shown; but each motor is provided with ashunt, in which are switches P′ and T″, as shown."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXI [05_Contents.xhtml#r23]MOTOR WITH A CONDENSER IN THE ARMATURE CIRCUIT [05_Contents.xhtml#r23]We now come to a new class of motors in which resort is had to condensers forthe purpose of developing the required difference of phase and neutralizing theeffects of self-induction. Mr. Tesla early began to apply the condenser toalternating apparatus, in just how many ways can only be learned from a perusalof other portions of this volume, especially those dealing with his highfrequency work.Certain laws govern the action or effects produced by a condenser when connectedto an electric circuit through which an alternating or in general an undulatingcurrent is made to pass. Some of the most important of such effects are asfollows: First, if the terminals or plates of a condenser be connected with twopoints of a circuit, the potentials of which are made to rise and fall in rapidsuccession, the condenser allows the passage, or more strictly speaking, thetransference of a current, although its plates or armatures may be so carefullyinsulated as to prevent almost completely the passage of a current of unvaryingstrength or direction and of moderate electromotive force. Second, if a circuit,the terminals of which are connected with the plates of the condenser, possess acertain self-induction, the condenser will overcome or counteract to a greateror less degree, dependent upon well-understood conditions, the effects of suchself-induction. Third, if two points of a closed or complete circuit throughwhich a rapidly rising and falling current flows be shunted or bridged by acondenser, a variation in the strength of the currents in the branches and alsoa difference of phase of the currents therein is produced. These effects Mr.Tesla has utilized and applied in a variety of ways in the construction andoperation of his motors, such as by producing a difference in phase in the twoenergizing circuits of an alternating current motor by connecting the twocircuits in derivation and connecting up a condenser in series in one of thecircuits. A further development, however, possesses certain novel features ofpractical value and involves a knowledge of facts less generally understood. Itcomprises the use of a condenser or condensers in connection with the induced orarmature circuit of a motor and certain details of the construction of suchmotors. In an alternating current motor of the type particularly referred toabove, or in any other which has an armature coil or circuit closed upon itself,the latter represents not only an inductive resistance, but one which isperiodically varying in value, both of which facts complicate and renderdifficult the attainment of the conditions best suited to the most efficientworking conditions; in other words, they require, first, that for a giveninductive effect upon the armature there should be the greatest possible currentthrough the armature or induced coils, and, second, that there should alwaysexist between the currents in the energizing and the induced circuits a givenrelation of phase. Hence whatever tends to decrease the self-induction andincrease the current in the induced circuits will, other things being equal,increase the output and efficiency of the motor, and the same will be true ofcauses that operate to maintain the mutual attractive effect between the fieldmagnets and armature at its maximum. Mr. Tesla secures these results byconnecting with the induced circuit or circuits a condenser, in the mannerdescribed below, and he also, with this purpose in view, constructs the motor ina special manner.Referring to the drawings, Fig. 86, is a view, mainly diagrammatic, of analternating current motor, in which the present principle is applied. Fig. 87 isa central section, in line with the shaft, of a special form of armature core.Fig. 88 is a similar section of a modification of the same. Fig. 89 is one ofthe sections of the core detached. Fig. 90 is a diagram showing a modifieddisposition of the armature or induced circuits.images [images/fig86.jpg]FIG. 86.images [images/fig87.jpg]FIG. 87.images [images/fig88.jpg]FIG. 88.images [images/fig89.jpg]FIG. 89.images [images/fig90.jpg]FIG. 90.The general plan of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 86. A A in this figurerepresent the frame and field magnets of an alternating current motor, the polesor projections of which are wound with coils B and C, forming independentenergizing circuits connected either to the same or to independent sources ofalternating currents, so that the currents flowing through the circuits,respectively, will have a difference of phase. Within the influence of thisfield is an armature core D, wound with coils E. In motors of this descriptionheretofore these coils have been closed upon themselves, or connected in aclosed series; but in the present case each coil or the connected series ofcoils terminates in the opposite plates of a condenser F. For this purpose theends of the series of coils are brought out through the shaft to collectingrings G, which are connected to the condenser by contact brushes H and suitableconductors, the condenser being independent of the machine. The armature coilsare wound or connected in such manner that adjacent coils produce oppositepoles.The action of this motor and the effect of the plan followed in its constructionare as follows: The motor being started in operation and the coils of the fieldmagnets being traversed by alternating currents, currents are induced in thearmature coils by one set of field coils, as B, and the poles thus establishedare acted upon by the other set, as C. The armature coils, however, havenecessarily a high self-induction, which opposes the flow of the currents thusset up. The condenser F not only permits the passage or transference of thesecurrents, but also counteracts the effects of self-induction, and by a properadjustment of the capacity of the condenser, the self-induction of the coils,and the periods of the currents, the condenser may be made to overcome entirelythe effect of self-induction.It is preferable on account of the undesirability of using sliding contacts ofany kind, to associate the condenser with the armature directly, or make it apart of the armature. In some cases Mr. Tesla builds up the armature of annularplates K K, held by bolts L between heads M, which are secured to the drivingshaft, and in the hollow space thus formed he places a condenser F, generally bywinding the two insulated plates spirally around the shaft. In other cases heutilizes the plates of the core itself as the plates of the condenser. Forexample, in Figs. 88 and 89, N is the driving shaft, M M are the heads of thearmature-core, and K K′ the iron plates of which the core is built up. Theseplates are insulated from the shaft and from one another, and are held togetherby rods or bolts L. The bolts pass through a large hole in one plate and a smallhole in the one next adjacent, and so on, connecting electrically all of platesK, as one armature of a condenser, and all of plates K′ as the other.To either of the condensers above described the armature coils may be connected,as explained by reference to Fig. 86.In motors in which the armature coils are closed upon themselves—as, forexample, in any form of alternating current motor in which one armature coil orset of coils is in the position of maximum induction with respect to the fieldcoils or poles, while the other is in the position of minimum induction—thecoils are best connected in one series, and two points of the circuit thusformed are bridged by a condenser. This is illustrated in Fig. 90, in which Erepresents one set of armature coils and E′ the other. Their points of union arejoined through a condenser F. It will be observed that in this disposition theself-induction of the two branches E and E′ varies with their positionrelatively to the field magnet, and that each branch is alternately thepredominating source of the induced current. Hence the effect of the condenser Fis twofold. First, it increases the current in each of the branches alternately,and, secondly, it alters the phase of the currents in the branches, this beingthe well-known effect which results from such a disposition of a condenser witha circuit, as above described. This effect is favorable to the proper working ofthe motor, because it increases the flow of current in the armature circuits dueto a given inductive effect, and also because it brings more nearly intocoincidence the maximum magnetic effects of the coacting field and armaturepoles.It will be understood, of course, that the causes that contribute to theefficiency of condensers when applied to such uses as the above must be givendue consideration in determining the practicability and efficiency of themotors. Chief among these is, as is well known, the periodicity of the current,and hence the improvements described are more particularly adapted to systems inwhich a very high rate of alternation or change is maintained.Although this invention has been illustrated in connection with a special formof motor, it will be understood that it is equally applicable to any otheralternating current motor in which there is a closed armature coil wherein thecurrents are induced by the action of the field, and the feature of utilizingthe plates or sections of a magnetic core for forming the condenser isapplicable, generally, to other kinds of alternating current apparatus."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXII [05_Contents.xhtml#r24]MOTOR WITH CONDENSER IN ONE OF THE FIELD CIRCUITS [05_Contents.xhtml#r24]If the field or energizing circuits of a rotary phase motor be both derived fromthe same source of alternating currents and a condenser of proper capacity beincluded in one of the same, approximately, the desired difference of phase maybe obtained between the currents flowing directly from the source and thoseflowing through the condenser; but the great size and expense of condensers forthis purpose that would meet the requirements of the ordinary systems ofcomparatively low potential are particularly prohibitory to their employment.Another, now well-known, method or plan of securing a difference of phasebetween the energizing currents of motors of this kind is to induce by thecurrents in one circuit those in the other circuit or circuits; but as no meanshad been proposed that would secure in this way between the phases of theprimary or inducing and the secondary or induced currents thatdifference—theoretically ninety degrees—that is best adapted for practical andeconomical working, Mr. Tesla devised a means which renders practicable both theabove described plans or methods, and by which he is enabled to obtain aneconomical and efficient alternating current motor. His invention consists inplacing a condenser in the secondary or induced circuit of the motor abovedescribed and raising the potential of the secondary currents to such a degreethat the capacity of the condenser, which is in part dependent on the potential,need be quite small. The value of this condenser is determined in awell-understood manner with reference to the self-induction and other conditionsof the circuit, so as to cause the currents which pass through it to differ fromthe primary currents by a quarter phase.Fig. 91 illustrates the invention as embodied in a motor in which the inductiverelation of the primary and secondary circuits is secured by winding them insidethe motor partly upon the same cores; but the invention applies, generally, toother forms of motor in which one of the energizing currents is induced in anyway from the other.images [images/fig91.jpg]FIG. 91.Let A B represent the poles of an alternating current motor, of which C is thearmature wound with coils D, closed upon themselves, as is now the generalpractice in motors of this kind. The poles A, which alternate with poles B, arewound with coils of ordinary or coarse wire E in such direction as to make themof alternate north and south polarity, as indicated in the diagram by thecharacters N S. Over these coils, or in other inductive relation to the same,are wound long fine-wire coils F F, and in the same direction throughout as thecoils E. These coils are secondaries, in which currents of very high potentialare induced. All the coils E in one series are connected, and all thesecondaries F in another.On the intermediate poles B are wound fine-wire energizing coils G, which areconnected in series with one another, and also with the series of secondarycoils F, the direction of winding being such that a current-impulse induced fromthe primary coils E imparts the same magnetism to the poles B as that producedin poles A by the primary impulse. This condition is indicated by the charactersN′ S′.In the circuit formed by the two sets of coils F and G is introduced a condenserH; otherwise this circuit is closed upon itself, while the free ends of thecircuit of coils E are connected to a source of alternating currents. As thecondenser capacity which is needed in any particular motor of this kind isdependent upon the rate of alternation or the potential, or both, its size orcost, as before explained, may be brought within economical limits for use withthe ordinary circuits if the potential of the secondary circuit in the motor besufficiently high. By giving to the condenser proper values, any desireddifference of phase between the primary and secondary energizing circuits may beobtained."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXIII [05_Contents.xhtml#r25]TESLA POLYPHASE TRANSFORMER [05_Contents.xhtml#r25]Applying the polyphase principle to the construction of transformers as well tothe motors already noticed, Mr. Tesla has invented some very interesting forms,which he considers free from the defects of earlier and, at present, morefamiliar forms. In these transformers he provides a series of inducing coils andcorresponding induced coils, which are generally wound upon a core closed uponitself, usually a ring of laminated iron.The two sets of coils are wound side by side or superposed or otherwise placedin well-known ways to bring them into the most effective relations to oneanother and to the core. The inducing or primary coils wound on the core aredivided into pairs or sets by the proper electrical connections, so that whilethe coils of one pair or set co-operate in fixing the magnetic poles of the coreat two given diametrically opposite points, the coils of the other pair orset—assuming, for sake of illustration, that there are but two—tend to fix thepoles ninety degrees from such points. With this induction device is used analternating current generator with coils or sets of coils to correspond withthose of the converter, and the corresponding coils of the generator andconverter are then connected up in independent circuits. It results from thisthat the different electrical phases in the generator are attended bycorresponding magnetic changes in the converter; or, in other words, that as thegenerator coils revolve, the points of greatest magnetic intensity in theconverter will be progressively shifted or whirled around.Fig. 92 is a diagrammatic illustration of the converter and the electricalconnections of the same. Fig. 93 is a horizontal central cross-section of Fig.92. Fig. 94 is a diagram of the circuits of the entire system, the generatorbeing shown in section.images [images/fig92.jpg]images [images/fig93.jpg]FIGS. 92 and 93.images [images/fig94.jpg]FIG. 94.Mr. Tesla uses a core, A, which is closed upon itself—that is to say, of anannular cylindrical or equivalent form—and as the efficiency of the apparatus islargely increased by the subdivision of this core, he makes it of thin strips,plates, or wires of soft iron electrically insulated as far as practicable. Uponthis core are wound, say, four coils, B B B′ B′, used as primary coils, and forwhich long lengths of comparatively fine wire are employed. Over these coils arethen wound shorter coils of coarser wire, C C C′ C′, to constitute the inducedor secondary coils. The construction of this or any equivalent form of convertermay be carried further, as above pointed out, by inclosing these coils withiron—as, for example, by winding over the coils layers of insulated iron wire.The device is provided with suitable binding posts, to which the ends of thecoils are led. The diametrically opposite coils B B and B′ B′ are connected,respectively, in series, and the four terminals are connected to the bindingposts. The induced coils are connected together in any desired manner. Forexample, as shown in Fig. 94, C C may be connected in multiple arc when aquantity current is desired—as for running a group of incandescent lamps—whileC′ C′ may be independently connected in series in a circuit including arc lampsor the like. The generator in this system will be adapted to the converter inthe manner illustrated. For example, in the present case there are employed apair of ordinary permanent or electromagnets, E E, between which is mounted acylindrical armature on a shaft, F, and wound with two coils, G G′. Theterminals of these coils are connected, respectively, to four insulated contactor collecting rings, H H H′ H′, and the four line circuit wires L connect thebrushes K, bearing on these rings, to the converter in the order shown. Notingthe results of this combination, it will be observed that at a given point oftime the coil G is in its neutral position and is generating little or nocurrent, while the other coil, G′, is in a position where it exerts its maximumeffect. Assuming coil G to be connected in circuit with coils B B of theconverter, and coil G′ with coils B′ B′, it is evident that the poles of thering A will be determined by coils B′ B′ alone; but as the armature of thegenerator revolves, coil G develops more current and coil G′ less, until Greaches its maximum and G′ its neutral position. The obvious result will be toshift the poles of the ring A through one-quarter of its periphery. The movementof the coils through the next quarter of a turn—during which coil G′ enters afield of opposite polarity and generates a current of opposite direction andincreasing strength, while coil G, in passing from its maximum to its neutralposition generates a current of decreasing strength and same direction asbefore—causes a further shifting of the poles through the second quarter of thering. The second halfrevolution will obviously be a repetition of the sameaction. By the shifting of the poles of the ring A, a powerful dynamic inductiveeffect on the coils C C′ is produced. Besides the currents generated in thesecondary coils by dynamo-magnetic induction, other currents will be set up inthe same coils in consequence of many variations in the intensity of the polesin the ring A. This should be avoided by maintaining the intensity of the polesconstant, to accomplish which care should be taken in designing andproportioning the generator and in distributing the coils in the ring A, andbalancing their effect. When this is done, the currents are produced bydynamo-magnetic induction only, the same result being obtained as though thepoles were shifted by a commutator with an infinite number of segments.The modifications which are applicable to other forms of converter are in manyrespects applicable to this, such as those pertaining more particularly to theform of the core, the relative lengths and resistances of the primary andsecondary coils, and the arrangements for running or operating the same."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXIV [05_Contents.xhtml#r26]A CONSTANT CURRENT TRANSFORMER WITH MAGNETICSHIELD BETWEEN COILS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY [05_Contents.xhtml#r26]Mr. Tesla has applied his principle of magnetic shielding of parts to theconstruction also of transformers, the shield being interposed between theprimary and secondary coils. In transformers of the ordinary type it will befound that the wave of electromotive force of the secondary very nearlycoincides with that of the primary, being, however, in opposite sign. At thesame time the currents, both primary and secondary, lag behind their respectiveelectromotive forces; but as this lag is practically or nearly the same in thecase of each it follows that the maximum and minimum of the primary andsecondary currents will nearly coincide, but differ in sign or direction,provided the secondary be not loaded or if it contain devices having theproperty of self-induction. On the other hand, the lag of the primary behind theimpressed electromotive force may be diminished by loading the secondary with anon-inductive or dead resistance—such as incandescent lamps—whereby the timeinterval between the maximum or minimum periods of the primary and secondarycurrents is increased. This time interval, however, is limited, and the resultsobtained by phase difference in the operation of such devices as the Teslaalternating current motors can only be approximately realized by such means ofproducing or securing this difference, as above indicated, for it is desirablein such cases that there should exist between the primary and secondarycurrents, or those which, however produced, pass through the two circuits of themotor, a difference of phase of ninety degrees; or, in other words, the currentin one circuit should be a maximum when that in the other circuit is a minimum.To attain to this condition more perfectly, an increased retardation of thesecondary current is secured in the following manner: Instead of bringing theprimary and secondary coils or circuits of a transformer into the closestpossible relations, as has hitherto been done, Mr. Tesla protects in a measurethe secondary from the inductive action or effect of the primary by surroundingeither the primary or the secondary with a comparatively thin magnetic shield orscreen. Under these modified conditions, as long as the primary current has asmall value, the shield protects the secondary; but as soon as the primarycurrent has reached a certain strength, which is arbitrarily determined, theprotecting magnetic shield becomes saturated and the inductive action upon thesecondary begins. It results, therefore, that the secondary current begins toflow at a certain fraction of a period later than it would without theinterposed shield, and since this retardation may be obtained withoutnecessarily retarding the primary current also, an additional lag is secured,and the time interval between the maximum or minimum periods of the primary andsecondary currents is increased. Such a transformer may, by properlyproportioning its several elements and determining the proper relations betweenthe primary and secondary windings, the thickness of the magnetic shield, andother conditions, be constructed to yield a constant current at all loads.Fig. 95 is a cross-section of a transformer embodying this improvement. Fig. 96is a similar view of a modified form of transformer, showing diagrammaticallythe manner of using the same.images [images/fig95.jpg]FIG. 95.images [images/fig96.jpg]FIG. 96.A A is the main core of the transformer, composed of a ring of soft annealed andinsulated or oxidized iron wire. Upon this core is wound the secondary circuitor coil B B. This latter is then covered with a layer or layers of annealed andinsulated iron wires C C, wound in a direction at right angles to the secondarycoil. Over the whole is then wound the primary coil or wire D D. From the natureof this construction it will be obvious that as long as the shield formed by thewires C is below magnetic saturation the secondary coil or circuit iseffectually protected or shielded from the inductive influence of the primary,although on open circuit it may exhibit some electromotive force. When thestrength of the primary reaches a certain value, the shield C, becomingsaturated, ceases to protect the secondary from inductive action, and current isin consequence developed therein. For similar reasons, when the primary currentweakens, the weakening of the secondary is retarded to the same or approximatelythe same extent.The specific construction of the transformer is largely immaterial. In Fig. 96,for example, the core A is built up of thin insulated iron plates or discs. Theprimary circuit D is wound next the core A. Over this is applied the shield C,which in this case is made up of thin strips or plates of iron properlyinsulated and surrounding the primary, forming a closed magnetic circuit. Thesecondary B is wound over the shield C. In Fig. 96, also, E is a source ofalternating or rapidly changing currents. The primary of the transformer isconnected with the circuit of the generator. F is a two-circuit alternatingcurrent motor, one of the circuits being connected with the main circuit fromthe source E, and the other being supplied with currents from the secondary ofthe transformer."},{"pageContent":"PART II [05_Contents.xhtml#r27]THE TESLA EFFECTS WITHHIGH FREQUENCY ANDHIGH POTENTIAL CURRENTS [05_Contents.xhtml#r27]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXV [05_Contents.xhtml#r28]INTRODUCTION—THE SCOPE OF THE TESLA LECTURES [05_Contents.xhtml#r28]Before proceeding to study the three Tesla lectures here presented, the readermay find it of some assistance to have his attention directed to the main pointsof interest and significance therein. The first of these lectures was deliveredin New York, at Columbia College, before the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers, May 20, 1891. The urgent desire expressed immediately from all partsof Europe for an opportunity to witness the brilliant and unusual experimentswith which the lecture was accompanied, induced Mr. Tesla to go to England earlyin 1892, when he appeared before the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and aday later, by special request, before the Royal Institution. His reception wasof the most enthusiastic and flattering nature on both occasions. He then went,by invitation, to France, and repeated his novel demonstrations before theSociété Internationale des Electriciens, and the Société Française de Physique.Mr. Tesla returned to America in the fall of 1892, and in February, 1893,delivered his third lecture before the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, infulfilment of a long standing promise to Prof. Houston. The following week, atthe request of President James I. Ayer, of the National Electric LightAssociation, the same lecture was re-delivered in St. Louis. It had beenintended to limit the invitations to members, but the appeals from residents inthe city were so numerous and pressing that it became necessary to secure a verylarge hall. Hence it came about that the lecture was listened to by an audienceof over 5,000 people, and was in some parts of a more popular nature than eitherof its predecessors. Despite this concession to the need of the hour andoccasion, Mr. Tesla did not hesitate to show many new and brilliant experiments,and to advance the frontier of discovery far beyond any point he had theretoforemarked publicly.We may now proceed to a running review of the lectures themselves. The groundcovered by them is so vast that only the leading ideas and experiments can herebe touched upon; besides, it is preferable that the lectures should be carefullygone over for their own sake, it being more than likely that each student willdiscover a new beauty or stimulus in them. Taking up the course of reasoningfollowed by Mr. Tesla in his first lecture, it will be noted that he started outwith the recognition of the fact, which he has now experimentally demonstrated,that for the production of light waves, primarily, electrostatic effects must bebrought into play, and continued study has led him to the opinion that allelectrical and magnetic effects may be referred to electrostatic molecularforces. This opinion finds a singular confirmation in one of the most strikingexperiments which he describes, namely, the production of a veritable flame bythe agitation of electrostatically charged molecules. It is of the highestinterest to observe that this result points out a way of obtaining a flame whichconsumes no material and in which no chemical action whatever takes place. Italso throws a light on the nature of the ordinary flame, which Mr. Teslabelieves to be due to electrostatic molecular actions, which, if true, wouldlead directly to the idea that even chemical affinities might be electrostaticin their nature and that, as has already been suggested, molecular forces ingeneral may be referable to one and the same cause. This singular phenomenonaccounts in a plausible manner for the unexplained fact that buildings arefrequently set on fire during thunder storms without having been at all struckby lightning. It may also explain the total disappearance of ships at sea.One of the striking proofs of the correctness of the ideas advanced by Mr. Teslais the fact that, notwithstanding the employment of the most powerfulelectromagnetic inductive effects, but feeble luminosity is obtainable, and thisonly in close proximity to the source of disturbance; whereas, when theelectrostatic effects are intensified, the same initial energy suffices toexcite luminosity at considerable distances from the source. That there are onlyelectrostatic effects active seems to be clearly proved by Mr. Tesla’sexperiments with an induction coil operated with alternating currents of veryhigh frequency. He shows how tubes may be made to glow brilliantly atconsiderable distances from any object when placed in a powerful, rapidlyalternating, electrostatic field, and he describes many interesting phenomenaobserved in such a field. His experiments open up the possibility of lighting anapartment by simply creating in it such an electrostatic field, and this, in acertain way, would appear to be the ideal method of lighting a room, as it wouldallow the illuminating device to be freely moved about. The power with whichthese exhausted tubes, devoid of any electrodes, light up is certainlyremarkable.That the principle propounded by Mr. Tesla is a broad one is evident from themany ways in which it may be practically applied. We need only refer to thevariety of the devices shown or described, all of which are novel in characterand will, without doubt, lead to further important results at the hands of Mr.Tesla and other investigators. The experiment, for instance, of lighting up asingle filament or block of refractory material with a single wire, is in itselfsufficient to give Mr. Tesla’s work the stamp of originality, and the numerousother experiments and effects which may be varied at will, are equally new andinteresting. Thus, the incandescent filament spinning in an unexhausted globe,the well-known Crookes experiment on open circuit, and the many otherssuggested, will not fail to interest the reader. Mr. Tesla has made anexhaustive study of the various forms of the discharge presented by an inductioncoil when operated with these rapidly alternating currents, starting from thethread-like discharge and passing through various stages to the true electricflame.A point of great importance in the introduction of high tension alternatingcurrent which Mr. Tesla brings out is the necessity of carefully avoiding allgaseous matter in the high tension apparatus. He shows that, at least with veryrapidly alternating currents of high potential, the discharge may work throughalmost any practicable thickness of the best insulators, if air is present. Insuch cases the air included within the apparatus is violently agitated and bymolecular bombardment the parts may be so greatly heated as to cause a ruptureof the insulation. The practical outcome of this is, that, whereas with steadycurrents, any kind of insulation may be used, with rapidly alternating currentsoils will probably be the best to employ, a fact which has been observed, butnot until now satisfactorily explained. The recognition of the above fact is ofspecial importance in the construction of the costly commercial induction coilswhich are often rendered useless in an unaccountable manner. The truth of theseviews of Mr. Tesla is made evident by the interesting experiments illustrativeof the behavior of the air between charged surfaces, the luminous streams formedby the charged molecules appearing even when great thicknesses of the bestinsulators are interposed between the charged surfaces. These luminous streamsafford in themselves a very interesting study for the experimenter. With theserapidly alternating currents they become far more powerful and produce beautifullight effects when they issue from a wire, pinwheel or other object attached toa terminal of the coil; and it is interesting to note that they issue from aball almost as freely as from a point, when the frequency is very high.From these experiments we also obtain a better idea of the importance of takinginto account the capacity and self-induction in the apparatus employed and thepossibilities offered by the use of condensers in conjunction with alternatecurrents, the employment of currents of high frequency, among other things,making it possible to reduce the condenser to practicable dimensions. Anotherpoint of interest and practical bearing is the fact, proved by Mr. Tesla, thatfor alternate currents, especially those of high frequency, insulators arerequired possessing a small specific inductive capacity, which at the same timehave a high insulating power.Mr. Tesla also makes interesting and valuable suggestion in regard to theeconomical utilization of iron in machines and transformers. He shows how, bymaintaining by continuous magnetization a flow of lines through the iron, thelatter may be kept near its maximum permeability and a higher output and economymay be secured in such apparatus. This principle may prove of considerablecommercial importance in the development of alternating systems. Mr. Tesla’ssuggestion that the same result can be secured by heating the iron by hysteresisand eddy currents, and increasing the permeability in this manner, while it mayappear less practical, nevertheless opens another direction for investigationand improvement.The demonstration of the fact that with alternating currents of high frequency,sufficient energy may be transmitted under practicable conditions through theglass of an incandescent lamp by electrostatic or electromagnetic induction maylead to a departure in the construction of such devices. Another importantexperimental result achieved is the operation of lamps, and even motors, withthe discharges of condensers, this method affording a means of converting director alternating currents. In this connection Mr. Tesla advocates the perfectingof apparatus capable of generating electricity of high tension from heat energy,believing this to be a better way of obtaining electrical energy for practicalpurposes, particularly for the production of light.While many were probably prepared to encounter curious phenomena of impedance inthe use of a condenser discharged disruptively, the experiments shown wereextremely interesting on account of their paradoxical character. The burning ofan incandescent lamp at any candle power when connected across a heavy metalbar, the existence of nodes on the bar and the possibility of exploring the barby means of an ordinary Cardew voltmeter, are all peculiar developments, butperhaps the most interesting observation is the phenomenon of impedance observedin the lamp with a straight filament, which remains dark while the bulb glows.Mr. Tesla’s manner of operating an induction coil by means of the disruptivedischarge, and thus obtaining enormous differences of potential fromcomparatively small and inexpensive coils, will be appreciated by experimentersand will find valuable application in laboratories. Indeed, his many suggestionsand hints in regard to the construction and use of apparatus in theseinvestigations will be highly valued and will aid materially in future research.The London lecture was delivered twice. In its first form, before theInstitution of Electrical Engineers, it was in some respects an amplification ofseveral points not specially enlarged upon in the New York lecture, but broughtforward many additional discoveries and new investigations. Its repetition, inanother form, at the Royal Institution, was due to Prof. Dewar, who with LordRayleigh, manifested a most lively interest in Mr. Tesla’s work, and whosekindness illustrated once more the strong English love of scientific truth andappreciation of its votaries. As an indefatigable experimenter, Mr. Tesla wascertainly nowhere more at home than in the haunts of Faraday, and as the guestof Faraday’s successor. This Royal Institution lecture summed up the leadingpoints of Mr. Tesla’s work, in the high potential, high frequency field, and wemay here avail ourselves of so valuable a summarization, in a simple form, of asubject by no means easy of comprehension until it has been thoroughly studied.In these London lectures, among the many notable points made was first, thedifficulty of constructing the alternators to obtain the very high frequenciesneeded. To obtain the high frequencies it was necessary to provide severalhundred polar projections, which were necessarily small and offered manydrawbacks, and this the more as exceedingly high peripheral speeds had to beresorted to. In some of the first machines both armature and field had polarprojections. These machines produced a curious noise, especially when thearmature was started from the state of rest, the field being charged. The mostefficient machine was found to be one with a drum armature, the iron body ofwhich consisted of very thin wire annealed with special care. It was, of course,desirable to avoid the employment of iron in the armature, and several machinesof this kind, with moving or stationary conductors were constructed, but theresults obtained were not quite satisfactory, on account of the great mechanicaland other difficulties encountered.The study of the properties of the high frequency currents obtained from thesemachines is very interesting, as nearly every experiment discloses somethingnew. Two coils traversed by such a current attract or repel each other with aforce which, owing to the imperfection of our sense of touch, seems continuous.An interesting observation, already noted under another form, is that a piece ofiron, surrounded by a coil through which the current is passing appears to becontinuously magnetized. This apparent continuity might be ascribed to thedeficiency of the sense of touch, but there is evidence that in currents of suchhigh frequencies one of the impulses preponderates over the other.As might be expected, conductors traversed by such currents are rapidly heated,owing to the increase of the resistance, and the heating effects are relativelymuch greater in the iron. The hysteresis losses in iron are so great that aniron core, even if finely subdivided, is heated in an incredibly short time. Togive an idea of this, an ordinary iron wire images [images/img_p137.jpg] inch indiameter inserted within a coil having 250 turns, with a current estimated to befive amperes passing through the coil, becomes within two seconds’ time so hotas to scorch wood. Beyond a certain frequency, an iron core, no matter howfinely subdivided, exercises a dampening effect, and it was easy to find a pointat which the impedance of a coil was not affected by the presence of a coreconsisting of a bundle of very thin well annealed and varnished iron wires.Experiments with a telephone, a conductor in a strong magnetic field, or with acondenser or arc, seem to afford certain proof that sounds far above the usuallyaccepted limit of hearing would be perceived if produced with sufficient power.The arc produced by these currents possesses several interesting features.Usually it emits a note the pitch of which corresponds to twice the frequency ofthe current, but if the frequency be sufficiently high it becomes noiseless, thelimit of audition being determined principally by the linear dimensions of thearc. A curious feature of the arc is its persistency, which is due partly to theinability of the gaseous column to cool and increase considerably in resistance,as is the case with low frequencies, and partly to the tendency of such a highfrequency machine to maintain a constant current.In connection with these machines the condenser affords a particularlyinteresting study. Striking effects are produced by proper adjustments ofcapacity and self-induction. It is easy to raise the electromotive force of themachine to many times the original value by simply adjusting the capacity of acondenser connected in the induced circuit. If the condenser be at some distancefrom the machine, the difference of potential on the terminals of the latter maybe only a small fraction of that on the condenser.But the most interesting experiences are gained when the tension of the currentsfrom the machine is raised by means of an induction coil. In consequence of theenormous rate of change obtainable in the primary current, much higher potentialdifferences are obtained than with coils operated in the usual ways, and, owingto the high frequency, the secondary discharge possesses many strikingpeculiarities. Both the electrodes behave generally alike, though it appearsfrom some observations that one current impulse preponderates over the other, asbefore mentioned.The physiological effects of the high tension discharge are found to be so smallthat the shock of the coil can be supported without any inconvenience, exceptperhaps a small burn produced by the discharge upon approaching the hand to oneof the terminals. The decidedly smaller physiological effects of these currentsare thought to be due either to a different distribution through the body or tothe tissues acting as condensers. But in the case of an induction coil with agreat many turns the harmlessness is principally due to the fact that but littleenergy is available in the external circuit when the same is closed through theexperimenter’s body, on account of the great impedance of the coil.In varying the frequency and strength of the currents through the primary of thecoil, the character of the secondary discharge is greatly varied, and no lessthan five distinct forms are observed: A weak, sensitive thread discharge, apowerful flaming discharge, and three forms of brush or streaming discharges.Each of these possesses certain noteworthy features, but the most interesting tostudy are the latter.Under certain conditions the streams, which are presumably due to the violentagitation of the air molecules, issue freely from all points of the coil, eventhrough a thick insulation. If there is the smallest air space between theprimary and secondary, they will form there and surely injure the coil by slowlywarming the insulation. As they form even with ordinary frequencies when thepotential is excessive, the air-space must be most carefully avoided. These highfrequency streamers differ in aspect and properties from those produced by astatic machine. The wind produced by them is small and should altogether ceaseif still considerably higher frequencies could be obtained. A peculiarity isthat they issue as freely from surfaces as from points. Owing to this, ametallic vane, mounted in one of the terminals of the coil so as to rotatefreely, and having one of its sides covered with insulation, is spun rapidlyaround. Such a vane would not rotate with a steady potential, but with a highfrequency coil it will spin, even if it be entirely covered with insulation,provided the insulation on one side be either thicker or of a higher specificinductive capacity. A Crookes electric radiometer is also spun around whenconnected to one of the terminals of the coil, but only at very high exhaustionor at ordinary pressures.There is still another and more striking peculiarity of such a high frequencystreamer, namely, it is hot. The heat is easily perceptible with frequencies ofabout 10,000, even if the potential is not excessively high. The heating effectis, of course, due to the molecular impacts and collisions. Could the frequencyand potential be pushed far enough, then a brush could be produced resembling inevery particular a flame and giving light and heat, yet without a chemicalprocess taking place.The hot brush, when properly produced, resembles a jet of burning gas escapingunder great pressure, and it emits an extraordinary strong smell of ozone. Thegreat ozonizing action is ascribed to the fact that the agitation of themolecules of the air is more violent in such a brush than in the ordinarystreamer of a static machine. But the most powerful brush discharges wereproduced by employing currents of much higher frequencies than it was possibleto obtain by means of the alternators. These currents were obtained bydisruptively discharging a condenser and setting up oscillations. In this mannercurrents of a frequency of several hundred thousand were obtained.Currents of this kind, Mr. Tesla pointed out, produce striking effects. At thesefrequencies, the impedance of a copper bar is so great that a potentialdifference of several hundred volts can be maintained between two points of ashort and thick bar, and it is possible to keep an ordinary incandescent lampburning at full candle power by attaching the terminals of the lamp to twopoints of the bar no more than a few inches apart. When the frequency isextremely high, nodes are found to exist on such a bar, and it is easy to locatethem by means of a lamp.By converting the high tension discharges of a low frequency coil in thismanner, it was found practicable to keep a few lamps burning on the ordinarycircuit in the laboratory, and by bringing the undulation to a low pitch, it waspossible to operate small motors.This plan likewise allows of converting high tension discharges of one directioninto low tension unidirectional currents, by adjusting the circuit so that thereare no oscillations. In passing the oscillating discharges through the primaryof a specially constructed coil, it is easy to obtain enormous potentialdifferences with only few turns of the secondary.Great difficulties were at first experienced in producing a successful coil onthis plan. It was found necessary to keep all air, or gaseous matter in general,away from the charged surfaces, and oil immersion was resorted to. The wiresused were heavily covered with gutta-percha and wound in oil, or the air waspumped out by means of a Sprengel pump. The general arrangement was thefollowing: An ordinary induction coil, operated from a low frequency alternator,was used to charge Leyden jars. The jars were made to discharge over a single ormultiple gap through the primary of the second coil. To insure the action of thegap, the arc was blown out by a magnet or air blast. To adjust the potential inthe secondary a small oil condenser was used, or polished brass spheres ofdifferent sizes were screwed on the terminals and their distance adjusted.When the conditions were carefully determined to suit each experiment,magnificent effects were obtained. Two wires, stretched through the room, eachbeing connected to one of the terminals of the coil, emitted streams so powerfulthat the light from them allowed distinguishing the objects in the room; thewires became luminous even though covered with thick and most excellentinsulation. When two straight wires, or two concentric circles of wire, areconnected to the terminals, and set at the proper distance, a uniform luminoussheet is produced between them. It was possible in this way to cover an area ofmore than one meter square completely with the streams. By attaching to oneterminal a large circle of wire and to the other terminal a small sphere, thestreams are focused upon the sphere, produce a strongly lighted spot upon thesame, and present the appearance of a luminous cone. A very thin wire glued upona plate of hard rubber of great thickness, on the opposite side of which isfastened a tinfoil coating, is rendered intensely luminous when the coating isconnected to the other terminal of the coil. Such an experiment can be performedalso with low frequency currents, but much less satisfactorily.When the terminals of such a coil, even of a very small one, are separated by arubber or glass plate, the discharge spreads over the plate in the form ofstreams, threads or brilliant sparks, and affords a magnificent display, whichcannot be equaled by the largest coil operated in the usual ways. By a simpleadjustment it is possible to produce with the coil a succession of brilliantsparks, exactly as with a Holtz machine.Under certain conditions, when the frequency of the oscillation is very great,white, phantom-like streams are seen to break forth from the terminals of thecoil. The chief interesting feature about them is, that they stream freelyagainst the outstretched hand or other conducting object without producing anysensation, and the hand may be approached very near to the terminal without aspark being induced to jump. This is due presumably to the fact that aconsiderable portion of the energy is carried away or dissipated in thestreamers, and the difference of potential between the terminal and the hand isdiminished.It is found in such experiments that the frequency of the vibration and thequickness of succession of the sparks between the knobs affect to a markeddegree the appearance of the streams. When the frequency is very low, the airgives way in more or less the same manner as by a steady difference ofpotential, and the streams consist of distinct threads, generally mingled withthin sparks, which probably correspond to the successive discharges occurringbetween the knobs. But when the frequency is very high, and the arc of thedischarge produces a sound which is loud and smooth (which indicates both thatoscillation takes place and that the sparks succeed each other with greatrapidity), then the luminous streams formed are perfectly uniform. They aregenerally of a purplish hue, but when the molecular vibration is increased byraising the potential, they assume a white color.The luminous intensity of the streams increases rapidly when the potential isincreased; and with frequencies of only a few hundred thousand, could the coilbe made to withstand a sufficiently high potential difference, there is no doubtthat the space around a wire could be made to emit a strong light, merely by theagitation of the molecules of the air at ordinary pressure.Such discharges of very high frequency which render luminous the air at ordinarypressure we have very likely occasion to witness in the aurora borealis. Frommany of these experiments it seems reasonable to infer that sudden cosmicdisturbances, such as eruptions on the sun, set the electrostatic charge of theearth in an extremely rapid vibration, and produce the glow by the violentagitation of the air in the upper and even in the lower strata. It is thoughtthat if the frequency were low, or even more so if the charge were not at allvibrating, the lower dense strata would break down as in a lightning discharge.Indications of such breaking down have been repeatedly observed, but they can beattributed to the fundamental disturbances, which are few in number, for thesuperimposed vibration would be so rapid as not to allow a disruptive break.The study of these discharge phenomena has led Mr. Tesla to the recognition ofsome important facts. It was found, as already stated, that gaseous matter mustbe most carefully excluded from any dielectric which is subjected to great,rapidly changing electrostatic stresses. Since it is difficult to exclude thegas perfectly when solid insulators are used, it is necessary to resort toliquid dielectrics. When a solid dielectric is used, it matters little how thickand how good it is; if air be present, streamers form, which gradually heat thedielectric and impair its insulating power, and the discharge finally breaksthrough. Under ordinary conditions the best insulators are those which possessthe highest specific inductive capacity, but such insulators are not the best toemploy when working with these high frequency currents, for in most cases thehigher specific inductive capacity is rather a disadvantage. The prime qualityof the insulating medium for these currents is continuity. For this reasonprincipally it is necessary to employ liquid insulators, such as oils. If twometal plates, connected to the terminals of the coil, are immersed in oil andset a distance apart, the coil may be kept working for any length of timewithout a break occurring, or without the oil being warmed, but if air bubblesare introduced, they become luminous; the air molecules, by their impact againstthe oil, heat it, and after some time cause the insulation to give way. If,instead of the oil, a solid plate of the best dielectric, even several timesthicker than the oil intervening between the metal plates, is inserted betweenthe latter, the air having free access to the charged surfaces, the dielectricinvariably is warmed and breaks down.The employment of oil is advisable or necessary even with low frequencies, ifthe potentials are such that streamers form, but only in such cases, as isevident from the theory of the action. If the potentials are so low thatstreamers do not form, then it is even disadvantageous to employ oil, for itmay, principally by confining the heat, be the cause of the breaking down of theinsulation.The exclusion of gaseous matter is not only desirable on account of the safetyof the apparatus, but also on account of economy, especially in a condenser, inwhich considerable waste of power may occur merely owing to the presence of air,if the electric density on the charged surfaces is great.In the course of these investigations a phenomenon of special scientificinterest was observed. It may be ranked among the brush phenomena, in fact it isa kind of brush which forms at, or near, a single terminal in high vacuum. In abulb with a conducting electrode, even if the latter be of aluminum, the brushhas only a very short existence, but it can be preserved for a considerablelength of time in a bulb devoid of any conducting electrode. To observe thephenomenon it is found best to employ a large spherical bulb having in itscenter a small bulb supported on a tube sealed to the neck of the former. Thelarge bulb being exhausted to a high degree, and the inside of the small bulbbeing connected to one of the terminals of the coil, under certain conditionsthere appears a misty haze around the small bulb, which, after passing throughsome stages, assumes the form of a brush, generally at right angles to the tubesupporting the small bulb. When the brush assumes this form it may be brought toa state of extreme sensitiveness to electrostatic and magnetic influence. Thebulb hanging straight down, and all objects being remote from it, the approachof the observer within a few paces will cause the brush to fly to the oppositeside, and if he walks around the bulb it will always keep on the opposite side.It may begin to spin around the terminal long before it reaches that sensitivestage. When it begins to turn around, principally, but also before, it isaffected by a magnet, and at a certain stage it is susceptible to magneticinfluence to an astonishing degree. A small permanent magnet, with its poles ata distance of no more than two centimeters will affect it visibly at a distanceof two meters, slowing down or accelerating the rotation according to how it isheld relatively to the brush.When the bulb hangs with the globe down, the rotation is always clockwise. Inthe southern hemisphere it would occur in the opposite direction, and on the(magnetic) equator the brush should not turn at all. The rotation may bereversed by a magnet kept at some distance. The brush rotates best, seemingly,when it is at right angles to the lines of force of the earth. It very likelyrotates, when at its maximum speed, in synchronism with the alternations, say,10,000 times a second. The rotation can be slowed down or accelerated by theapproach or recession of the observer, or any conducting body, but it cannot bereversed by putting the bulb in any position. Very curious experiments may beperformed with the brush when in its most sensitive state. For instance, thebrush resting in one position, the experimenter may, by selecting a properposition, approach the hand at a certain considerable distance to the bulb, andhe may cause the brush to pass off by merely stiffening the muscles of the arm,the mere change of configuration of the arm and the consequent imperceptibledisplacement being sufficient to disturb the delicate balance. When it begins torotate slowly, and the hands are held at a proper distance, it is impossible tomake even the slightest motion without producing a visible effect upon thebrush. A metal plate connected to the other terminal of the coil affects it at agreat distance, slowing down the rotation often to one turn a second.Mr. Tesla hopes that this phenomenon will prove a valuable aid in theinvestigation of the nature of the forces acting in an electrostatic or magneticfield. If there is any motion which is measurable going on in the space, such abrush would be apt to reveal it. It is, so to speak, a beam of light,frictionless, devoid of inertia. On account of its marvellous sensitiveness toelectrostatic or magnetic disturbances it may be the means of sending signalsthrough submarine cables with any speed, and even of transmitting intelligenceto a distance without wires.In operating an induction coil with these rapidly alternating currents, it isastonishing to note, for the first time, the great importance of the relation ofcapacity, self-induction, and frequency as bearing upon the general result. Thecombined effect of these elements produces many curious effects. For instance,two metal plates are connected to the terminals and set at a small distance, sothat an arc is formed between them. This arc prevents a strong current fromflowing through the coil. If the arc be interrupted by the interposition of aglass plate, the capacity of the condenser obtained counteracts theself-induction, and a stronger current is made to pass. The effects of capacityare the most striking, for in these experiments, since the self-induction andfrequency both are high, the critical capacity is very small, and need be butslightly varied to produce a very considerable change. The experimenter bringshis body in contact with the terminals of the secondary of the coil, or attachesto one or both terminals insulated bodies of very small bulk, such as exhaustedbulbs, and he produces a considerable rise or fall of potential on thesecondary, and greatly affects the flow of the current through the primary coil.In many of the phenomena observed, the presence of the air, or, generallyspeaking, of a medium of a gaseous nature (using this term not to imply specificproperties, but in contradistinction to homogeneity or perfect continuity) playsan important part, as it allows energy to be dissipated by molecular impact orbombardment. The action is thus explained: When an insulated body connected to aterminal of the coil is suddenly charged to high potential, it acts inductivelyupon the surrounding air, or whatever gaseous medium there might be. Themolecules or atoms which are near it are, of course, more attracted, and movethrough a greater distance than the further ones. When the nearest moleculesstrike the body they are repelled, and collisions occur at all distances withinthe inductive distance. It is now clear that, if the potential be steady, butlittle loss of energy can be caused in this way, for the molecules which arenearest to the body having had an additional charge imparted to them by contact,are not attracted until they have parted, if not with all, at least with most ofthe additional charge, which can be accomplished only after a great manycollisions. This is inferred from the fact that with a steady potential there isbut little loss in dry air. When the potential, instead of being steady, isalternating, the conditions are entirely different. In this case a rhythmicalbombardment occurs, no matter whether the molecules after coming in contact withthe body lose the imparted charge or not, and, what is more, if the charge isnot lost, the impacts are all the more violent. Still, if the frequency of theimpulses be very small, the loss caused by the impacts and collisions would notbe serious unless the potential was excessive. But when extremely highfrequencies and more or less high potentials are used, the loss may be verygreat. The total energy lost per unit of time is proportionate to the product ofthe number of impacts per second, or the frequency and the energy lost in eachimpact. But the energy of an impact must be proportionate to the square of theelectric density of the body, on the assumption that the charge imparted to themolecule is proportionate to that density. It is concluded from this that thetotal energy lost must be proportionate to the product of the frequency and thesquare of the electric density; but this law needs experimental confirmation.Assuming the preceding considerations to be true, then, by rapidly alternatingthe potential of a body immersed in an insulating gaseous medium, any amount ofenergy may be dissipated into space. Most of that energy, then, is notdissipated in the form of long ether waves, propagated to considerable distance,as is thought most generally, but is consumed in impact and collisionallosses—that is, heat vibrations—on the surface and in the vicinity of the body.To reduce the dissipation it is necessary to work with a small electricdensity—the smaller, the higher the frequency.The behavior of a gaseous medium to such rapid alternations of potential makesit appear plausible that electrostatic disturbances of the earth, produced bycosmic events, may have great influence upon the meteorological conditions. Whensuch disturbances occur both the frequency of the vibrations of the charge andthe potential are in all probability excessive, and the energy converted intoheat may be considerable. Since the density must be unevenly distributed, eitherin consequence of the irregularity of the earth’s surface, or on account of thecondition of the atmosphere in various places, the effect produced wouldaccordingly vary from place to place. Considerable variations in the temperatureand pressure of the atmosphere may in this manner be caused at any point of thesurface of the earth. The variations may be gradual or very sudden, according tothe nature of the original disturbance, and may produce rain and storms, orlocally modify the weather in any way.From many experiences gathered in the course of these investigations it appearscertain that in lightning discharges the air is an element of importance. Forinstance, during a storm a stream may form on a nail or pointed projection of abuilding. If lightning strikes somewhere in the neighborhood, the harmlessstatic discharge may, in consequence of the oscillations set up, assume thecharacter of a high-frequency streamer, and the nail or projection may bebrought to a high temperature by the violent impact of the air molecules. Thus,it is thought, a building may be set on fire without the lightning striking it.In like manner small metallic objects may be fused and volatilized—as frequentlyoccurs in lightning discharges—merely because they are surrounded by air. Werethey immersed in a practically continuous medium, such as oil, they wouldprobably be safe, as the energy would have to spend itself elsewhere.An instructive experience having a bearing on this subject is the following: Aglass tube of an inch or so in diameter and several inches long is taken, and aplatinum wire sealed into it, the wire running through the center of the tubefrom end to end. The tube is exhausted to a moderate degree. If a steady currentis passed through the wire it is heated uniformly in all parts and the gas inthe tube is of no consequence. But if high frequency discharges are directedthrough the wire, it is heated more on the ends than in the middle portion, andif the frequency, or rate of charge, is high enough, the wire might as well becut in the middle as not, for most of the heating on the ends is due to therarefied gas. Here the gas might only act as a conductor of no impedance,diverting the current from the wire as the impedance of the latter is enormouslyincreased, and merely heating the ends of the wire by reason of their resistanceto the passage of the discharge. But it is not at all necessary that the gas inthe tube should be conducting; it might be at an extremely low pressure, stillthe ends of the wire would be heated; however, as is ascertained by experience,only the two ends would in such case not be electrically connected through thegaseous medium. Now, what with these frequencies and potentials occurs in anexhausted tube, occurs in the lightning discharge at ordinary pressure.From the facility with which any amount of energy may be carried off through agas, Mr. Tesla infers that the best way to render harmless a lightning dischargeis to afford it in some way a passage through a volume of gas.The recognition of some of the above facts has a bearing upon far-reachingscientific investigations in which extremely high frequencies and potentials areused. In such cases the air is an important factor to be considered. So, forinstance, if two wires are attached to the terminals of the coil, and thestreamers issue from them, there is dissipation of energy in the form of heatand light, and the wires behave like a condenser of larger capacity. If thewires be immersed in oil, the dissipation of energy is prevented, or at leastreduced, and the apparent capacity is diminished. The action of the air wouldseem to make it very difficult to tell, from the measured or computed capacityof a condenser in which the air is acted upon, its actual capacity or vibrationperiod, especially if the condenser is of very small surface and is charged to avery high potential. As many important results are dependant upon thecorrectness of the estimation of the vibration period, this subject demands themost careful scrutiny of investigators.In Leyden jars the loss due to the presence of air is comparatively small,principally on account of the great surface of the coatings and the smallexternal action, but if there are streamers on the top, the loss may beconsiderable, and the period of vibration is affected. In a resonator, thedensity is small, but the frequency is extreme, and may introduce a considerableerror. It appears certain, at any rate, that the periods of vibration of acharged body in a gaseous and in a continuous medium, such as oil, aredifferent, on account of the action of the former, as explained.Another fact recognized, which is of some consequence, is, that in similarinvestigations the general considerations of static screening are not applicablewhen a gaseous medium is present. This is evident from the following experiment:A short and wide glass tube is taken and covered with a substantial coating ofbronze powder, barely allowing the light to shine a little through. The tube ishighly exhausted and suspended on a metallic clasp from the end of a wire. Whenthe wire is connected with one of the terminals of the coil, the gas inside ofthe tube is lighted in spite of the metal coating. Here the metal evidently doesnot screen the gas inside as it ought to, even if it be very thin and poorlyconducting. Yet, in a condition of rest the metal coating, however thin, screensthe inside perfectly.One of the most interesting results arrived at in pursuing these experiments, isthe demonstration of the fact that a gaseous medium, upon which vibration isimpressed by rapid changes of electrostatic potential, is rigid. In illustrationof this result an experiment made by Mr. Tesla may be cited: A glass tube aboutone inch in diameter and three feet long, with outside condenser coatings on theends, was exhausted to a certain point, when, the tube being suspended freelyfrom a wire connecting the upper coating to one of the terminals of the coil,the discharge appeared in the form of a luminous thread passing through the axisof the tube. Usually the thread was sharply defined in the upper part of thetube and lost itself in the lower part. When a magnet or the finger was quicklypassed near the upper part of the luminous thread, it was brought out ofposition by magnetic or electrostatic influence, and a transversal vibrationlike that of a suspended cord, with one or more distinct nodes, was set up,which lasted for a few minutes and gradually died out. By suspending from thelower condenser coating metal plates of different sizes, the speed of thevibration was varied. This vibration would seem to show beyond doubt that thethread possessed rigidity, at least to transversal displacements.Many experiments were tried to demonstrate this property in air at ordinarypressure. Though no positive evidence has been obtained, it is thought,nevertheless, that a high frequency brush or streamer, if the frequency could bepushed far enough, would be decidedly rigid. A small sphere might then be movedwithin it quite freely, but if thrown against it the sphere would rebound. Anordinary flame cannot possess rigidity to a marked degree because the vibrationis directionless; but an electric arc, it is believed, must possess thatproperty more or less. A luminous band excited in a bulb by repeated dischargesof a Leyden jar must also possess rigidity, and if deformed and suddenlyreleased should vibrate.From like considerations other conclusions of interest are reached. The mostprobable medium filling the space is one consisting of independent carriersimmersed in an insulating fluid. If through this medium enormous electrostaticstresses are assumed to act, which vary rapidly in intensity, it would allow themotion of a body through it, yet it would be rigid and elastic, although thefluid itself might be devoid of these properties. Furthermore, on the assumptionthat the independent carriers are of any configuration such that the fluidresistance to motion in one direction is greater than in another, a stress ofthat nature would cause the carriers to arrange themselves in groups, since theywould turn to each other their sides of the greatest electric density, in whichposition the fluid resistance to approach would be smaller than to receding. Ifin a medium of the above characteristics a brush would be formed by a steadypotential, an exchange of the carriers would go on continually, and there wouldbe less carriers per unit of volume in the brush than in the space at somedistance from the electrode, this corresponding to rarefaction. If the potentialwere rapidly changing, the result would be very different; the higher thefrequency of the pulses, the slower would be the exchange of the carriers;finally, the motion of translation through measurable space would cease, and,with a sufficiently high frequency and intensity of the stress, the carrierswould be drawn towards the electrode, and compression would result.An interesting feature of these high frequency currents is that they allow ofoperating all kinds of devices by connecting the device with only one leadingwire to the electric source. In fact, under certain conditions it may be moreeconomical to supply the electrical energy with one lead than with two.An experiment of special interest shown by Mr. Tesla, is the running, by the useof only one insulated line, of a motor operating on the principle of therotating magnetic field enunciated by Mr. Tesla. A simple form of such a motoris obtained by winding upon a laminated iron core a primary and close to it asecondary coil, closing the ends of the latter and placing a freely movablemetal disc within the influence of the moving field. The secondary coil may,however, be omitted. When one of the ends of the primary coil of the motor isconnected to one of the terminals of the high frequency coil and the other endto an insulated metal plate, which, it should be stated, is not absolutelynecessary for the success of the experiment, the disc is set in rotation.Experiments of this kind seem to bring it within possibility to operate a motorat any point of the earth’s surface from a central source, without anyconnection to the same except through the earth. If, by means of powerfulmachinery, rapid variations of the earth’s potential were produced, a groundedwire reaching up to some height would be traversed by a current which could beincreased by connecting the free end of the wire to a body of some size. Thecurrent might be converted to low tension and used to operate a motor or otherdevice. The experiment, which would be one of great scientific interest, wouldprobably best succeed on a ship at sea. In this manner, even if it were notpossible to operate machinery, intelligence might be transmitted quitecertainly.In the course of this experimental study special attention was devoted to theheating effects produced by these currents, which are not only striking, butopen up the possibility of producing a more efficient illuminant. It issufficient to attach to the coil terminal a thin wire or filament, to have thetemperature of the latter perceptibly raised. If the wire or filament beenclosed in a bulb, the heating effect is increased by preventing thecirculation of the air. If the air in the bulb be strongly compressed, thedisplacements are smaller, the impacts less violent, and the heating effect isdiminished. On the contrary, if the air in the bulb be exhausted, an inclosedlamp filament is brought to incandescence, and any amount of light may thus beproduced.The heating of the inclosed lamp filament depends on so many things of adifferent nature, that it is difficult to give a generally applicable rule underwhich the maximum heating occurs. As regards the size of the bulb, it isascertained that at ordinary or only slightly differing atmospheric pressures,when air is a good insulator, the filament is heated more in a small bulb,because of the better confinement of heat in this case. At lower pressures, whenair becomes conducting, the heating effect is greater in a large bulb, but atexcessively high degrees of exhaustion there seems to be, beyond a certain andrather small size of the vessel, no perceptible difference in the heating.The shape of the vessel is also of some importance, and it has been found ofadvantage for reasons of economy to employ a spherical bulb with the electrodemounted in its center, where the rebounding molecules collide.It is desirable on account of economy that all the energy supplied to the bulbfrom the source should reach without loss the body to be heated. The loss inconveying the energy from the source to the body may be reduced by employingthin wires heavily coated with insulation, and by the use of electrostaticscreens. It is to be remarked, that the screen cannot be connected to the groundas under ordinary conditions.In the bulb itself a large portion of the energy supplied may be lost bymolecular bombardment against the wire connecting the body to be heated with thesource. Considerable improvement was effected by covering the glass stemcontaining the wire with a closely fitting conducting tube. This tube is made toproject a little above the glass, and prevents the cracking of the latter nearthe heated body. The effectiveness of the conducting tube is limited to veryhigh degrees of exhaustion. It diminishes the energy lost in bombardment for tworeasons; first, the charge given up by the atoms spreads over a greater area,and hence the electric density at any point is small, and the atoms are repelledwith less energy than if they would strike against a good insulator; secondly,as the tube is electrified by the atoms which first come in contact with it, theprogress of the following atoms against the tube is more or less checked by therepulsion which the electrified tube must exert upon the similarly electrifiedatoms. This, it is thought, explains why the discharge through a bulb isestablished with much greater facility when an insulator, than when a conductor,is present.During the investigations a great many bulbs of different construction, withelectrodes of different material, were experimented upon, and a number ofobservations of interest were made. Mr. Tesla has found that the deteriorationof the electrode is the less, the higher the frequency. This was to be expected,as then the heating is effected by many small impacts, instead by fewer and moreviolent ones, which quickly shatter the structure. The deterioration is alsosmaller when the vibration is harmonic. Thus an electrode, maintained at acertain degree of heat, lasts much longer with currents obtained from analternator, than with those obtained by means of a disruptive discharge. One ofthe most durable electrodes was obtained from strongly compressed carborundum,which is a kind of carbon recently produced by Mr. E. G. Acheson, of MonongahelaCity, Pa. From experience, it is inferred, that to be most durable, theelectrode should be in the form of a sphere with a highly polished surface.In some bulbs refractory bodies were mounted in a carbon cup and put under themolecular impact. It was observed in such experiments that the carbon cup washeated at first, until a higher temperature was reached; then most of thebombardment was directed against the refractory body, and the carbon wasrelieved. In general, when different bodies were mounted in the bulb, thehardest fusible would be relieved, and would remain at a considerably lowertemperature. This was necessitated by the fact that most of the energy suppliedwould find its way through the body which was more easily fused or “evaporated.”Curiously enough it appeared in some of the experiments made, that a body wasfused in a bulb under the molecular impact by evolution of less light than whenfused by the application of heat in ordinary ways. This may be ascribed to aloosening of the structure of the body under the violent impacts and changingstresses.Some experiments seem to indicate that under certain conditions a body,conducting or nonconducting, may, when bombarded, emit light, which to allappearances is due to phosphorescence, but may in reality be caused by theincandescence of an infinitesimal layer, the mean temperature of the body beingcomparatively small. Such might be the case if each single rhythmical impactwere capable of instantaneously exciting the retina, and the rhythm were justhigh enough to cause a continuous impression in the eye. According to this view,a coil operated by disruptive discharge would be eminently adapted to producesuch a result, and it is found by experience that its power of excitingphosphorescence is extraordinarily great. It is capable of excitingphosphorescence at comparatively low degrees of exhaustion, and also projectsshadows at pressures far greater than those at which the mean free path iscomparable to the dimensions of the vessel. The latter observation is of someimportance, inasmuch as it may modify the generally accepted views in regard tothe “radiant state” phenomena.A thought which early and naturally suggested itself to Mr. Tesla, was toutilize the great inductive effects of high frequency currents to produce lightin a sealed glass vessel without the use of leading in wires. Accordingly, manybulbs were constructed in which the energy necessary to maintain a button orfilament at high incandescence, was supplied through the glass by eitherelectrostatic or electrodynamic induction. It was easy to regulate the intensityof the light emitted by means of an externally applied condenser coatingconnected to an insulated plate, or simply by means of a plate attached to thebulb which at the same time performed the function of a shade.A subject of experiment, which has been exhaustively treated in England by Prof.J. J. Thomson, has been followed up independently by Mr. Tesla from thebeginning of this study, namely, to excite by electrodynamic induction aluminous band in a closed tube or bulb. In observing the behavior of gases, andthe luminous phenomena obtained, the importance of the electrostatic effects wasnoted and it appeared desirable to produce enormous potential differences,alternating with extreme rapidity. Experiments in this direction led to some ofthe most interesting results arrived at in the course of these investigations.It was found that by rapid alternations of a high electrostatic potential,exhausted tubes could be lighted at considerable distances from a conductorconnected to a properly constructed coil, and that it was practicable toestablish with the coil an alternating electrostatic field, acting through thewhole room and lighting a tube wherever it was placed within the four walls.Phosphorescent bulbs may be excited in such a field, and it is easy to regulatethe effect by connecting to the bulb a small insulated metal plate. It waslikewise possible to maintain a filament or button mounted in a tube at brightincandescence, and, in one experiment, a mica vane was spun by the incandescenceof a platinum wire.Coming now to the lecture delivered in Philadelphia and St. Louis, it may beremarked that to the superficial reader, Mr. Tesla’s introduction, dealing withthe importance of the eye, might appear as a digression, but the thoughtfulreader will find therein much food for meditation and speculation. Throughouthis discourse one can trace Mr. Tesla’s effort to present in a popular waythoughts and views on the electrical phenomena which have in recent yearscaptivated the scientific world, but of which the general public has even yetmerely received an inkling. Mr. Tesla also dwells rather extensively on hiswell-known method of high-frequency conversion; and the large amount of detailinformation will be gratefully received by students and experimenters in thisvirgin field. The employment of apt analogies in explaining the fundamentalprinciples involved makes it easy for all to gain a clear idea of their nature.Again, the ease with which, thanks to Mr. Tesla’s efforts, these high-frequencycurrents may now be obtained from circuits carrying almost any kind of current,cannot fail to result in an extensive broadening of this field of research,which offers so many possibilities. Mr. Tesla, true philosopher as he is, doesnot hesitate to point out defects in some of his methods, and indicates thelines which to him seem the most promising. Particular stress is laid by himupon the employment of a medium in which the discharge electrodes should beimmersed in order that this method of conversion may be brought to the highestperfection. He has evidently taken pains to give as much useful information aspossible to those who wish to follow in his path, as he shows in detail thecircuit arrangements to be adopted in all ordinary cases met with in practice,and although some of these methods were described by him two years before, theadditional information is still timely and welcome.In his experiments he dwells first on some phenomena produced by electrostaticforce, which he considers in the light of modern theories to be the mostimportant force in nature for us to investigate. At the very outset he shows astrikingly novel experiment illustrating the effect of a rapidly varyingelectrostatic force in a gaseous medium, by touching with one hand one of theterminals of a 200,000 volt transformer and bringing the other hand to theopposite terminal. The powerful streamers which issued from his hand andastonished his audiences formed a capital illustration of some of the viewsadvanced, and afforded Mr. Tesla an opportunity of pointing out the true reasonswhy, with these currents, such an amount of energy can be passed through thebody with impunity. He then showed by experiment the difference between a steadyand a rapidly varying force upon the dielectric. This difference is moststrikingly illustrated in the experiment in which a bulb attached to the end ofa wire in connection with one of the terminals of the transformer is ruptured,although all extraneous bodies are remote from the bulb. He next illustrates howmechanical motions are produced by a varying electrostatic force acting througha gaseous medium. The importance of the action of the air is particularlyillustrated by an interesting experiment.Taking up another class of phenomena, namely, those of dynamic electricity, Mr.Tesla produced in a number of experiments a variety of effects by the employmentof only a single wire with the evident intent of impressing upon his audiencethe idea that electric vibration or current can be transmitted with ease,without any return circuit; also how currents so transmitted can be convertedand used for many practical purposes. A number of experiments are then shown,illustrating the effects of frequency, self-induction and capacity; then anumber of ways of operating motive and other devices by the use of a singlelead. A number of novel impedance phenomena are also shown which cannot fail toarouse interest.Mr. Tesla next dwelt upon a subject which he thinks of great importance, thatis, electrical resonance, which he explained in a popular way. He expressed hisfirm conviction that by observing proper conditions, intelligence, and possiblyeven power, can be transmitted through the medium or through the earth; and heconsiders this problem worthy of serious and immediate consideration.Coming now to the light phenomena in particular, he illustrated the fourdistinct kinds of these phenomena in an original way, which to many must havebeen a revelation. Mr. Tesla attributes these light effects to molecular oratomic impacts produced by a varying electrostatic stress in a gaseous medium.He illustrated in a series of novel experiments the effect of the gassurrounding the conductor and shows beyond a doubt that with high frequency andhigh potential currents, the surrounding gas is of paramount importance in theheating of the conductor. He attributes the heating partially to a conductioncurrent and partially to bombardment, and demonstrates that in many cases theheating may be practically due to the bombardment alone. He pointed out alsothat the skin effect is largely modified by the presence of the gas or of anatomic medium in general. He showed also some interesting experiments in whichthe effect of convection is illustrated. Probably one of the most curiousexperiments in this connection is that in which a thin platinum wire stretchedalong the axis of an exhausted tube is brought to incandescence at certainpoints corresponding to the position of the striae, while at others it remainsdark. This experiment throws an interesting light upon the nature of the striaeand may lead to important revelations.Mr. Tesla also demonstrated the dissipation of energy through an atomic mediumand dwelt upon the behavior of vacuous space in conveying heat, and in thisconnection showed the curious behavior of an electrode stream, from which heconcludes that the molecules of a gas probably cannot be acted upon directly atmeasurable distances.Mr. Tesla summarized the chief results arrived at in pursuing his investigationsin a manner which will serve as a valuable guide to all who may engage in thiswork. Perhaps most interest will center on his general statements regarding thephenomena of phosphorescence, the most important fact revealed in this directionbeing that when exciting a phosphorescent bulb a certain definite potentialgives the most economical result.The lectures will now be presented in the order of their date of delivery."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXVI [05_Contents.xhtml#r29]EXPERIMENTS WITH ALTERNATE CURRENTS OF VERY HIGHFREQUENCY AND THEIR APPLICATION TO METHODS OFARTIFICIAL ILLUMINATION [05_Contents.xhtml#r29]*There is no subject more captivating, more worthy of study, than nature. Tounderstand this great mechanism, to discover the forces which are active, andthe laws which govern them, is the highest aim of the intellect of man.Nature has stored up in the universe infinite energy. The eternal recipient andtransmitter of this infinite energy is the ether. The recognition of theexistence of ether, and of the functions it performs, is one of the mostimportant results of modern scientific research. The mere abandoning of the ideaof action at a distance, the assumption of a medium pervading all space andconnecting all gross matter, has freed the minds of thinkers of an ever presentdoubt, and, by opening a new horizon—new and unforeseen possibilities—has givenfresh interest to phenomena with which we are familiar of old. It has been agreat step towards the understanding of the forces of nature and their multifoldmanifestations to our senses. It has been for the enlightened student of physicswhat the understanding of the mechanism of the firearm or of the steam engine isfor the barbarian. Phenomena upon which we used to look as wonders bafflingexplanation, we now see in a different light. The spark of an induction coil,the glow of an incandescent lamp, the manifestations of the mechanical forces ofcurrents and magnets are no longer beyond our grasp; instead of theincomprehensible, as before, their observation suggests now in our minds asimple mechanism, and although as to its precise nature all is still conjecture,yet we know that the truth cannot be much longer hidden, and instinctively wefeel that the understanding is dawning upon us. We still admire these beautifulphenomena, these strange forces, but we are helpless no longer; we can in acertain measure explain them, account for them, and we are hopeful of finallysucceeding in unraveling the mystery which surrounds them.In how far we can understand the world around us is the ultimate thought ofevery student of nature. The coarseness of our senses prevents us fromrecognizing the ulterior construction of matter, and astronomy, this grandestand most positive of natural sciences, can only teach us something that happens,as it were, in our immediate neighborhood: of the remoter portions of theboundless universe, with its numberless stars and suns, we know nothing. But farbeyond the limit of perception of our senses the spirit still can guide us, andso we may hope that even these unknown worlds—infinitely small and great—may ina measure become known to us. Still, even if this knowledge should reach us, thesearching mind will find a barrier, perhaps forever unsurpassable, to the truerecognition of that which seems to be, the mere appearance of which is the onlyand slender basis of all our philosophy.Of all the forms of nature’s immeasurable, all-pervading energy, which ever andever changing and moving, like a soul animates the inert universe, electricityand magnetism are perhaps the most fascinating. The effects of gravitation, ofheat and light we observe daily, and soon we get accustomed to them, and soonthey lose for us the character of the marvelous and wonderful; but electricityand magnetism, with their singular relationship, with their seemingly dualcharacter, unique among the forces in nature, with their phenomena ofattractions, repulsions and rotations, strange manifestations of mysteriousagents, stimulate and excite the mind to thought and research. What iselectricity, and what is magnetism? These questions have been asked again andagain. The most able intellects have ceaselessly wrestled with the problem;still the question has not as yet been fully answered. But while we cannot eventoday state what these singular forces are, we have made good headway towardsthe solution of the problem. We are now confident that electric and magneticphenomena are attributable to ether, and we are perhaps justified in saying thatthe effects of static electricity are effects of ether under strain, and thoseof dynamic electricity and electro-magnetism effects of ether in motion. Butthis still leaves the question, as to what electricity and magnetism are,unanswered.First, we naturally inquire, What is electricity, and is there such a thing aselectricity? In interpreting electric phenomena, we may speak of electricity orof an electric condition, state or effect. If we speak of electric effects wemust distinguish two such effects, opposite in character and neutralizing eachother, as observation shows that two such opposite effects exist. This isunavoidable, for in a medium of the properties of ether, we cannot possiblyexert a strain, or produce a displacement or motion of any kind, without causingin the surrounding medium an equivalent and opposite effect. But if we speak ofelectricity, meaning a thing, we must, I think, abandon the idea of twoelectricities, as the existence of two such things is highly improbable. For howcan we imagine that there should be two things, equivalent in amount, alike intheir properties, but of opposite character, both clinging to matter, bothattracting and completely neutralizing each other? Such an assumption, thoughsuggested by many phenomena, though most convenient for explaining them, haslittle to commend it. If there is such a thing as electricity, there can be onlyone such thing, and excess and want of that one thing, possibly; but moreprobably its condition determines the positive and negative character. The oldtheory of Franklin, though falling short in some respects, is, from a certainpoint of view, after all, the most plausible one. Still, in spite of this, thetheory of the two electricities is generally accepted, as it apparently explainselectric phenomena in a more satisfactory manner. But a theory which betterexplains the facts is not necessarily true. Ingenious minds will invent theoriesto suit observation, and almost every independent thinker has his own views onthe subject.It is not with the object of advancing an opinion, but with the desire ofacquainting you better with some of the results, which I will describe, to showyou the reasoning I have followed, the departures I have made—that I venture toexpress, in a few words, the views and convictions which have led me to theseresults.I adhere to the idea that there is a thing which we have been in the habit ofcalling electricity. The question is, What is that thing? or, What, of allthings, the existence of which we know, have we the best reason to callelectricity? We know that it acts like an incompressible fluid; that there mustbe a constant quantity of it in nature; that it can be neither produced nordestroyed; and, what is more important, the electro-magnetic theory of light andall facts observed teach us that electric and ether phenomena are identical. Theidea at once suggests itself, therefore, that electricity might be called ether.In fact, this view has in a certain sense been advanced by Dr. Lodge. Hisinteresting work has been read by everyone and many have been convinced by hisarguments. His great ability and the interesting nature of the subject, keep thereader spellbound; but when the impressions fade, one realizes that he has todeal only with ingenious explanations. I must confess, that I cannot believe intwo electricities, much less in a doubly-constituted ether. The puzzlingbehavior of the ether as a solid to waves of light and heat, and as a fluid tothe motion of bodies through it, is certainly explained in the most natural andsatisfactory manner by assuming it to be in motion, as Sir William Thomson hassuggested; but regardless of this, there is nothing which would enable us toconclude with certainty that, while a fluid is not capable of transmittingtransverse vibrations of a few hundred or thousand per second, it might not becapable of transmitting such vibrations when they range into hundreds of millionmillions per second. Nor can anyone prove that there are transverse ether wavesemitted from an alternate current machine, giving a small number of alternationsper second; to such slow disturbances, the ether, if at rest, may behave as atrue fluid.Returning to the subject, and bearing in mind that the existence of twoelectricities is, to say the least, highly improbable, we must remember, that wehave no evidence of electricity, nor can we hope to get it, unless gross matteris present. Electricity, therefore, cannot be called ether in the broad sense ofthe term; but nothing would seem to stand in the way of calling electricityether associated with matter, or bound ether; or, in other words, that theso-called static charge of the molecule is ether associated in some way with themolecule. Looking at it in that light, we would be justified in saying, thatelectricity is concerned in all molecular actions.Now, precisely what the ether surrounding the molecules is, wherein it differsfrom ether in general, can only be conjectured. It cannot differ in density,ether being incompressible: it must, therefore, be under some strain or inmotion, and the latter is the most probable. To understand its functions, itwould be necessary to have an exact idea of the physical construction of matter,of which, of course, we can only form a mental picture.But of all the views on nature, the one which assumes one matter and one force,and a perfect uniformity throughout, is the most scientific and most likely tobe true. An infinitesimal world, with the molecules and their atoms spinning andmoving in orbits, in much the same manner as celestial bodies, carrying withthem and probably spinning with them ether, or in other words, carrying withthem static charges, seems to my mind the most probable view, and one which, ina plausible manner, accounts for most of the phenomena observed. The spinning ofthe molecules and their ether sets up the ether tensions or electrostaticstrains; the equalization of ether tensions sets up ether motions or electriccurrents, and the orbital movements produce the effects of electro and permanentmagnetism.About fifteen years ago, Prof. Rowland demonstrated a most interesting andimportant fact, namely, that a static charge carried around produces the effectsof an electric current. Leaving out of consideration the precise nature of themechanism, which produces the attraction and repulsion of currents, andconceiving the electrostatically charged molecules in motion, this experimentalfact gives us a fair idea of magnetism. We can conceive lines or tubes of forcewhich physically exist, being formed of rows of directed moving molecules; wecan see that these lines must be closed, that they must tend to shorten andexpand, etc. It likewise explains in a reasonable way, the most puzzlingphenomenon of all, permanent magnetism, and, in general, has all the beauties ofthe Ampere theory without possessing the vital defect of the same, namely, theassumption of molecular currents. Without enlarging further upon the subject, Iwould say, that I look upon all electrostatic, current and magnetic phenomena asbeing due to electrostatic molecular forces.The preceding remarks I have deemed necessary to a full understanding of thesubject as it presents itself to my mind.Of all these phenomena the most important to study are the current phenomena, onaccount of the already extensive and evergrowing use of currents for industrialpurposes. It is now a century since the first practical source of current wasproduced, and, ever since, the phenomena which accompany the flow of currentshave been diligently studied, and through the untiring efforts of scientific menthe simple laws which govern them have been discovered. But these laws are foundto hold good only when the currents are of a steady character. When the currentsare rapidly varying in strength, quite different phenomena, often unexpected,present themselves, and quite different laws hold good, which even now have notbeen determined as fully as is desirable, though through the work, principally,of English scientists, enough knowledge has been gained on the subject to enableus to treat simple cases which now present themselves in daily practice.The phenomena which are peculiar to the changing character of the currents aregreatly exalted when the rate of change is increased, hence the study of thesecurrents is considerably facilitated by the employment of properly constructedapparatus. It was with this and other objects in view that I constructedalternate current machines capable of giving more than two million reversals ofcurrent per minute, and to this circumstance it is principally due, that I amable to bring to your attention some of the results thus far reached, which Ihope will prove to be a step in advance on account of their direct bearing uponone of the most important problems, namely, the production of a practical andefficient source of light.The study of such rapidly alternating currents is very interesting. Nearly everyexperiment discloses something new. Many results may, of course, be predicted,but many more are unforeseen. The experimenter makes many interestingobservations. For instance, we take a piece of iron and hold it against amagnet. Starting from low alternations and running up higher and higher we feelthe impulses succeed each other faster and faster, get weaker and weaker, andfinally disappear. We then observe a continuous pull; the pull, of course, isnot continuous; it only appears so to us; our sense of touch is imperfect.We may next establish an arc between the electrodes and observe, as thealternations rise, that the note which accompanies alternating arcs getsshriller and shriller, gradually weakens, and finally ceases. The airvibrations, of course, continue, but they are too weak to be perceived; oursense of hearing fails us.We observe the small physiological effects, the rapid heating of the iron coresand conductors, curious inductive effects, interesting condenser phenomena, andstill more interesting light phenomena with a high tension induction coil. Allthese experiments and observations would be of the greatest interest to thestudent, but their description would lead me too far from the principal subject.Partly for this reason, and partly on account of their vastly greaterimportance, I will confine myself to the description of the light effectsproduced by these currents.In the experiments to this end a high tension induction coil or equivalentapparatus for converting currents of comparatively low into currents of hightension is used.If you will be sufficiently interested in the results I shall describe as toenter into an experimental study of this subject; if you will be convinced ofthe truth of the arguments I shall advance—your aim will be to produce highfrequencies and high potentials; in other words, powerful electrostatic effects.You will then encounter many difficulties, which, if completely overcome, wouldallow us to produce truly wonderful results.First will be met the difficulty of obtaining the required frequencies by meansof mechanical apparatus, and, if they be obtained otherwise, obstacles of adifferent nature will present themselves. Next it will be found difficult toprovide the requisite insulation without considerably increasing the size of theapparatus, for the potentials required are high, and, owing to the rapidity ofthe alternations, the insulation presents peculiar difficulties. So, forinstance, when a gas is present, the discharge may work, by the molecularbombardment of the gas and consequent heating, through as much as an inch of thebest solid insulating material, such as glass, hard rubber, porcelain, sealingwax, etc.; in fact, through any known insulating substance. The chief requisitein the insulation of the apparatus is, therefore, the exclusion of any gaseousmatter.In general my experience tends to show that bodies which possess the highestspecific inductive capacity, such as glass, afford a rather inferior insulationto others, which, while they are good insulators, have a much smaller specificinductive capacity, such as oils, for instance, the dielectric losses being nodoubt greater in the former. The difficulty of insulating, of course, onlyexists when the potentials are excessively high, for with potentials such as afew thousand volts there is no particular difficulty encountered in conveyingcurrents from a machine giving, say, 20,000 alternations per second, to quite adistance. This number of alternations, however, is by far too small for manypurposes, though quite sufficient for some practical applications. Thisdifficulty of insulating is fortunately not a vital drawback; it affects mostlythe size of the apparatus, for, when excessively high potentials would be used,the light-giving devices would be located not far from the apparatus, and oftenthey would be quite close to it. As the air-bombardment of the insulated wire isdependent on condenser action, the loss may be reduced to a trifle by usingexcessively thin wires heavily insulated.Another difficulty will be encountered in the capacity and self-inductionnecessarily possessed by the coil. If the coil be large, that is, if it containa great length of wire, it will be generally unsuited for excessively highfrequencies; if it be small, it may be well adapted for such frequencies, butthe potential might then not be as high as desired. A good insulator, andpreferably one possessing a small specific inductive capacity, would afford atwo-fold advantage. First, it would enable us to construct a very small coilcapable of withstanding enormous differences of potential; and secondly, such asmall coil, by reason of its smaller capacity and self-induction, would becapable of a quicker and more vigorous vibration. The problem then ofconstructing a coil or induction apparatus of any kind possessing the requisitequalities I regard as one of no small importance, and it has occupied me for aconsiderable time.The investigator who desires to repeat the experiments which I will describe,with an alternate current machine, capable of supplying currents of the desiredfrequency, and an induction coil, will do well to take the primary coil out andmount the secondary in such a manner as to be able to look through the tube uponwhich the secondary is wound. He will then be able to observe the streams whichpass from the primary to the insulating tube, and from their intensity he willknow how far he can strain the coil. Without this precaution he is sure toinjure the insulation. This arrangement permits, however, an easy exchange ofthe primaries, which is desirable in these experiments.The selection of the type of machine best suited for the purpose must be left tothe judgment of the experimenter. There are here illustrated three distincttypes of machines, which, besides others, I have used in my experiments.Fig. 97 represents the machine used in my experiments before this Institute. Thefield magnet consists of a ring of wrought iron with 384 pole projections. Thearmature comprises a steel disc to which is fastened a thin, carefully weldedrim of wrought iron. Upon the rim are wound several layers of fine, wellannealed iron wire, which, when wound, is passed through shellac. The armaturewires are wound around brass pins, wrapped with silk thread. The diameter of thearmature wire in this type of machine should not be more than ⅙ of the thicknessof the pole projections, else the local action will be considerable.images [images/fig97.jpg]FIG. 97.Fig. 98 represents a larger machine of a different type. The field magnet ofthis machine consists of two like parts which either enclose an exciting coil,or else are independently wound. Each part has 480 pole projections, theprojections of one facing those of the other. The armature consists of a wheelof hard bronze, carrying the conductors which revolve between the projections ofthe field magnet. To wind the armature conductors, I have found it mostconvenient to proceed in the following manner. I construct a ring of hard bronzeof the required size. This ring and the rim of the wheel are provided with theproper number of pins, and both fastened upon a plate. The armature conductorsbeing wound, the pins are cut off and the ends of the conductors fastened by tworings which screw to the bronze ring and the rim of the wheel, respectively. Thewhole may then be taken off and forms a solid structure. The conductors in sucha type of machine should consist of sheet copper, the thickness of which, ofcourse, depends on the thickness of the pole projections; or else twisted thinwires should be employed.images [images/fig98.jpg]FIG. 98.Fig. 99 is a smaller machine, in many respects similar to the former, only herethe armature conductors and the exciting coil are kept stationary, while only ablock of wrought iron is revolved.images [images/fig99.jpg]FIG. 99.It would be uselessly lengthening this description were I to dwell more on thedetails of construction of these machines. Besides, they have been describedsomewhat more elaborately in The Electrical Engineer, of March 18, 1891. I deemit well, however, to call the attention of the investigator to two things, theimportance of which, though self evident, he is nevertheless apt tounderestimate; namely, to the local action in the conductors which must becarefully avoided, and to the clearance, which must be small. I may add, thatsince it is desirable to use very high peripheral speeds, the armature should beof very large diameter in order to avoid impracticable belt speeds. Of theseveral types of these machines which have been constructed by me, I have foundthat the type illustrated in Fig. 97 caused me the least trouble inconstruction, as well as in maintenance, and on the whole, it has been a goodexperimental machine.In operating an induction coil with very rapidly alternating currents, among thefirst luminous phenomena noticed are naturally those presented by thehigh-tension discharge. As the number of alternations per second is increased,or as—the number being high—the current through the primary is varied, thedischarge gradually changes in appearance. It would be difficult to describe theminor changes which occur, and the conditions which bring them about, but onemay note five distinct forms of the discharge.First, one may observe a weak, sensitive discharge in the form of a thin,feeble-colored thread. (Fig. 100a.) It always occurs when, the number ofalternations per second being high, the current through the primary is verysmall. In spite of the excessively small current, the rate of change is great,and the difference of potential at the terminals of the secondary is thereforeconsiderable, so that the arc is established at great distances; but thequantity of “electricity” set in motion is insignificant, barely sufficient tomaintain a thin, threadlike arc. It is excessively sensitive and may be made soto such a degree that the mere act of breathing near the coil will affect it,and unless it is perfectly well protected from currents of air, it wrigglesaround constantly. Nevertheless, it is in this form excessively persistent, andwhen the terminals are approached to, say, one-third of the striking distance,it can be blown out only with difficulty. This exceptional persistency, whenshort, is largely due to the arc being excessively thin; presenting, therefore,a very small surface to the blast. Its great sensitiveness, when very long, isprobably due to the motion of the particles of dust suspended in the air.images [images/fig100a.jpg]FIG. 100a.When the current through the primary is increased, the discharge gets broaderand stronger, and the effect of the capacity of the coil becomes visible until,finally, under proper conditions, a white flaming arc, Fig. 100b, often as thickas one’s finger, and striking across the whole coil, is produced. It developsremarkable heat, and may be further characterized by the absence of the highnote which accompanies the less powerful discharges. To take a shock from thecoil under these conditions would not be advisable, although under differentconditions, the potential being much higher, a shock from the coil may be takenwith impunity. To produce this kind of discharge the number of alternations persecond must not be too great for the coil used; and, generally speaking, certainrelations between capacity, self-induction and frequency must be observed.images [images/fig100b.jpg]FIG. 100b.The importance of these elements in an alternate current circuit is nowwell-known, and under ordinary conditions, the general rules are applicable. Butin an induction coil exceptional conditions prevail. First, the self-inductionis of little importance before the arc is established, when it asserts itself,but perhaps never as prominently as in ordinary alternate current circuits,because the capacity is distributed all along the coil, and by reason of thefact that the coil usually discharges through very great resistances; hence thecurrents are exceptionally small. Secondly, the capacity goes on increasingcontinually as the potential rises, in consequence of absorption which takesplace to a considerable extent. Owing to this there exists no criticalrelationship between these quantities, and ordinary rules would not seem to beapplicable. As the potential is increased either in consequence of the increasedfrequency or of the increased current through the primary, the amount of theenergy stored becomes greater and greater, and the capacity gains more and morein importance. Up to a certain point the capacity is beneficial, but after thatit begins to be an enormous drawback. It follows from this that each coil givesthe best result with a given frequency and primary current. A very large coil,when operated with currents of very high frequency, may not give as much as ⅛inch spark. By adding capacity to the terminals, the condition may be improved,but what the coil really wants is a lower frequency.When the flaming discharge occurs, the conditions are evidently such that thegreatest current is made to flow through the circuit. These conditions may beattained by varying the frequency within wide limits, but the highest frequencyat which the flaming arc can still be produced, determines, for a given primarycurrent, the maximum striking distance of the coil. In the flaming discharge theeclat effect of the capacity is not perceptible; the rate at which the energy isbeing stored then just equals the rate at which it can be disposed of throughthe circuit. This kind of discharge is the severest test for a coil; the break,when it occurs, is of the nature of that in an overcharged Leyden jar. To give arough approximation I would state that, with an ordinary coil of, say 10,000ohms resistance, the most powerful arc would be produced with about 12,000alternations per second.When the frequency is increased beyond that rate, the potential, of course,rises, but the striking distance may, nevertheless, diminish, paradoxical as itmay seem. As the potential rises the coil attains more and more the propertiesof a static machine until, finally, one may observe the beautiful phenomenon ofthe streaming discharge, Fig. 101, which may be produced across the whole lengthof the coil. At that stage streams begin to issue freely from all points andprojections. These streams will also be seen to pass in abundance in the spacebetween the primary and the insulating tube. When the potential is excessivelyhigh they will always appear, even if the frequency be low, and even if theprimary be surrounded by as much as an inch of wax, hard rubber, glass, or anyother insulating substance. This limits greatly the output of the coil, but Iwill later show how I have been able to overcome to a considerable extent thisdisadvantage in the ordinary coil.images [images/fig101.jpg]FIG. 101.Besides the potential, the intensity of the streams depends on the frequency;but if the coil be very large they show themselves, no matter how low thefrequencies used. For instance, in a very large coil of a resistance of 67,000ohms, constructed by me some time ago, they appear with as low as 100alternations per second and less, the insulation of the secondary being ¾ inchof ebonite. When very intense they produce a noise similar to that produced bythe charging of a Holtz machine, but much more powerful, and they emit a strongsmell of ozone. The lower the frequency, the more apt they are to suddenlyinjure the coil. With excessively high frequencies they may pass freely withoutproducing any other effect than to heat the insulation slowly and uniformly.The existence of these streams shows the importance of constructing an expensivecoil so as to permit of one’s seeing through the tube surrounding the primary,and the latter should be easily exchangeable; or else the space between theprimary and secondary should be completely filled up with insulating material soas to exclude all air. The non-observance of this simple rule in theconstruction of commercial coils is responsible for the destruction of many anexpensive coil.At the stage when the streaming discharge occurs, or with somewhat higherfrequencies, one may, by approaching the terminals quite nearly, and regulatingproperly the effect of capacity, produce a veritable spray of small silver-whitesparks, or a bunch of excessively thin silvery threads (Fig. 102) amidst apowerful brush—each spark or thread possibly corresponding to one alternation.This, when produced under proper conditions, is probably the most beautifuldischarge, and when an air blast is directed against it, it presents a singularappearance. The spray of sparks, when received through the body, causes someinconvenience, whereas, when the discharge simply streams, nothing at all islikely to be felt if large conducting objects are held in the hands to protectthem from receiving small burns.images [images/fig102.jpg]FIG. 102.If the frequency is still more increased, then the coil refuses to give anyspark unless at comparatively small distances, and the fifth typical form ofdischarge may be observed (Fig. 103). The tendency to stream out and dissipateis then so great that when the brush is produced at one terminal no sparkingoccurs, even if, as I have repeatedly tried, the hand, or any conducting object,is held within the stream; and, what is more singular, the luminous stream isnot at all easily deflected by the approach of a conducting body.images [images/fig103.jpg]FIG. 103.At this stage the streams seemingly pass with the greatest freedom throughconsiderable thicknesses of insulators, and it is particularly interesting tostudy their behavior. For this purpose it is convenient to connect to theterminals of the coil two metallic spheres which may be placed at any desireddistance, Fig. 104. Spheres are preferable to plates, as the discharge can bebetter observed. By inserting dielectric bodies between the spheres, beautifuldischarge phenomena may be observed. If the spheres be quite close and a sparkbe playing between them, by interposing a thin plate of ebonite between thespheres the spark instantly ceases and the discharge spreads into an intenselyluminous circle several inches in diameter, provided the spheres aresufficiently large. The passage of the streams heats, and, after a while,softens, the rubber so much that two plates may be made to stick together inthis manner. If the spheres are so far apart that no spark occurs, even if theyare far beyond the striking distance, by inserting a thick plate of glass thedischarge is instantly induced to pass from the spheres to the glass in the formof luminous streams. It appears almost as though these streams pass through thedielectric. In reality this is not the case, as the streams are due to themolecules of the air which are violently agitated in the space between theoppositely charged surfaces of the spheres. When no dielectric other than air ispresent, the bombardment goes on, but is too weak to be visible; by inserting adielectric the inductive effect is much increased, and besides, the projectedair molecules find an obstacle and the bombardment becomes so intense that thestreams become luminous. If by any mechanical means we could effect such aviolent agitation of the molecules we could produce the same phenomenon. A jetof air escaping through a small hole under enormous pressure and strikingagainst an insulating substance, such as glass, may be luminous in the dark, andit might be possible to produce a phosphorescence of the glass or otherinsulators in this manner.images [images/fig104.jpg]FIG. 104.The greater the specific inductive capacity of the interposed dielectric, themore powerful the effect produced. Owing to this, the streams show themselveswith excessively high potentials even if the glass be as much as one andone-half to two inches thick. But besides the heating due to bombardment, someheating goes on undoubtedly in the dielectric, being apparently greater in glassthan in ebonite. I attribute this to the greater specific inductive capacity ofthe glass, in consequence of which, with the same potential difference, agreater amount of energy is taken up in it than in rubber. It is like connectingto a battery a copper and a brass wire of the same dimensions. The copper wire,though a more perfect conductor, would heat more by reason of its taking morecurrent. Thus what is otherwise considered a virtue of the glass is here adefect. Glass usually gives way much quicker than ebonite; when it is heated toa certain degree, the discharge suddenly breaks through at one point, assumingthen the ordinary form of an arc.The heating effect produced by molecular bombardment of the dielectric would, ofcourse, diminish as the pressure of the air is increased, and at enormouspressure it would be negligible, unless the frequency would increasecorrespondingly.It will be often observed in these experiments that when the spheres are beyondthe striking distance, the approach of a glass plate, for instance, may inducethe spark to jump between the spheres. This occurs when the capacity of thespheres is somewhat below the critical value which gives the greatest differenceof potential at the terminals of the coil. By approaching a dielectric, thespecific inductive capacity of the space between the spheres is increased,producing the same effect as if the capacity of the spheres were increased. Thepotential at the terminals may then rise so high that the air space is cracked.The experiment is best performed with dense glass or mica.Another interesting observation is that a plate of insulating material, when thedischarge is passing through it, is strongly attracted by either of the spheres,that is by the nearer one, this being obviously due to the smaller mechanicaleffect of the bombardment on that side, and perhaps also to the greaterelectrification.From the behavior of the dielectrics in these experiments, we may conclude thatthe best insulator for these rapidly alternating currents would be the onepossessing the smallest specific inductive capacity and at the same time onecapable of withstanding the greatest differences of potential; and thus twodiametrically opposite ways of securing the required insulation are indicated,namely, to use either a perfect vacuum or a gas under great pressure; but theformer would be preferable. Unfortunately neither of these two ways is easilycarried out in practice.It is especially interesting to note the behavior of an excessively high vacuumin these experiments. If a test tube, provided with external electrodes andexhausted to the highest possible degree, be connected to the terminals of thecoil, Fig. 105, the electrodes of the tube are instantly brought to a hightemperature and the glass at each end of the tube is rendered intenselyphosphorescent, but the middle appears comparatively dark, and for a whileremains cool.images [images/fig105.jpg]FIG. 105.When the frequency is so high that the discharge shown in Fig. 103 is observed,considerable dissipation no doubt occurs in the coil. Nevertheless the coil maybe worked for a long time, as the heating is gradual.In spite of the fact that the difference of potential may be enormous, little isfelt when the discharge is passed through the body, provided the hands arearmed. This is to some extent due to the higher frequency, but principally tothe fact that less energy is available externally, when the difference ofpotential reaches an enormous value, owing to the circumstance that, with therise of potential, the energy absorbed in the coil increases as the square ofthe potential. Up to a certain point the energy available externally increaseswith the rise of potential, then it begins to fall off rapidly. Thus, with theordinary high tension induction coil, the curious paradox exists, that, whilewith a given current through the primary the shock might be fatal, with manytimes that current it might be perfectly harmless, even if the frequency be thesame. With high frequencies and excessively high potentials when the terminalsare not connected to bodies of some size, practically all the energy supplied tothe primary is taken up by the coil. There is no breaking through, no localinjury, but all the material, insulating and conducting, is uniformly heated.To avoid misunderstanding in regard to the physiological effect of alternatingcurrents of very high frequency, I think it necessary to state that, while it isan undeniable fact that they are incomparably less dangerous than currents oflow frequencies, it should not be thought that they are altogether harmless.What has just been said refers only to currents from an ordinary high tensioninduction coil, which currents are necessarily very small; if received directlyfrom a machine or from a secondary of low resistance, they produce more or lesspowerful effects, and may cause serious injury, especially when used inconjunction with condensers.The streaming discharge of a high tension induction coil differs in manyrespects from that of a powerful static machine. In color it has neither theviolet of the positive, nor the brightness of the negative, static discharge,but lies somewhere between, being, of course, alternatively positive andnegative. But since the streaming is more powerful when the point or terminal iselectrified positively, than when electrified negatively, it follows that thepoint of the brush is more like the positive, and the root more like thenegative, static discharge. In the dark, when the brush is very powerful, theroot may appear almost white. The wind produced by the escaping streams, thoughit may be very strong—often indeed to such a degree that it may be felt quite adistance from the coil—is, nevertheless, considering the quantity of thedischarge, smaller than that produced by the positive brush of a static machine,and it affects the flame much less powerfully. From the nature of the phenomenonwe can conclude that the higher the frequency, the smaller must, of course, bethe wind produced by the streams, and with sufficiently high frequencies no windat all would be produced at the ordinary atmospheric pressures. With frequenciesobtainable by means of a machine, the mechanical effect is sufficiently great torevolve, with considerable speed, large pin-wheels, which in the dark present abeautiful appearance owing to the abundance of the streams (Fig. 106).images [images/fig106.jpg]FIG. 106.In general, most of the experiments usually performed with a static machine canbe performed with an induction coil when operated with very rapidly alternatingcurrents. The effects produced, however, are much more striking, being ofincomparably greater power. When a small length of ordinary cotton covered wire,Fig. 107, is attached to one terminal of the coil, the streams issuing from allpoints of the wire may be so intense as to produce a considerable light effect.When the potentials and frequencies are very high, a wire insulated with guttapercha or rubber and attached to one of the terminals, appears to be coveredwith a luminous film. A very thin bare wire when attached to a terminal emitspowerful streams and vibrates continually to and fro or spins in a circle,producing a singular effect (Fig. 108). Some of these experiments have beendescribed by me in The Electrical World, of February 21, 1891.images [images/fig107.jpg]FIG. 107.images [images/fig108.jpg]FIG. 108.Another peculiarity of the rapidly alternating discharge of the induction coilis its radically different behavior with respect to points and rounded surfaces.If a thick wire, provided with a ball at one end and with a point at the other,be attached to the positive terminal of a static machine, practically all thecharge will be lost through the point, on account of the enormously greatertension, dependent on the radius of curvature. But if such a wire is attached toone of the terminals of the induction coil, it will be observed that with veryhigh frequencies streams issue from the ball almost as copiously as from thepoint (Fig. 109).images [images/fig109.jpg]FIG. 109.It is hardly conceivable that we could produce such a condition to an equaldegree in a static machine, for the simple reason, that the tension increases asthe square of the density, which in turn is proportional to the radius ofcurvature; hence, with a steady potential an enormous charge would be requiredto make streams issue from a polished ball while it is connected with a point.But with an induction coil the discharge of which alternates with great rapidityit is different. Here we have to deal with two distinct tendencies. First, thereis the tendency to escape which exists in a condition of rest, and which dependson the radius of curvature; second, there is the tendency to dissipate into thesurrounding air by condenser action, which depends on the surface. When one ofthese tendencies is a maximum, the other is at a minimum. At the point theluminous stream is principally due to the air molecules coming bodily in contactwith the point; they are attracted and repelled, charged and discharged, and,their atomic charges being thus disturbed, vibrate and emit light waves. At theball, on the contrary, there is no doubt that the effect is to a great extentproduced inductively, the air molecules not necessarily coming in contact withthe ball, though they undoubtedly do so. To convince ourselves of this we onlyneed to exalt the condenser action, for instance, by enveloping the ball, atsome distance, by a better conductor than the surrounding medium, the conductorbeing, of course, insulated; or else by surrounding it with a better dielectricand approaching an insulated conductor; in both cases the streams will breakforth more copiously. Also, the larger the ball with a given frequency, or thehigher the frequency, the more will the ball have the advantage over the point.But, since a certain intensity of action is required to render the streamsvisible, it is obvious that in the experiment described the ball should not betaken too large.In consequence of this two-fold tendency, it is possible to produce by means ofpoints, effects identical to those produced by capacity. Thus, for instance, byattaching to one terminal of the coil a small length of soiled wire, presentingmany points and offering great facility to escape, the potential of the coil maybe raised to the same value as by attaching to the terminal a polished ball of asurface many times greater than that of the wire.An interesting experiment, showing the effect of the points, may be performed inthe following manner: Attach to one of the terminals of the coil a cottoncovered wire about two feet in length, and adjust the conditions so that streamsissue from the wire. In this experiment the primary coil should be preferablyplaced so that it extends only about half way into the secondary coil. Now touchthe free terminal of the secondary with a conducting object held in the hand, orelse connect it to an insulated body of some size. In this manner the potentialon the wire may be enormously raised. The effect of this will be either toincrease, or to diminish, the streams. If they increase, the wire is too short;if they diminish, it is too long. By adjusting the length of the wire, a pointis found where the touching of the other terminal does not at all affect thestreams. In this case the rise of potential is exactly counteracted by the dropthrough the coil. It will be observed that small lengths of wire produceconsiderable difference in the magnitude and luminosity of the streams. Theprimary coil is placed sidewise for two reasons: First, to increase thepotential at the wire; and, second, to increase the drop through the coil. Thesensitiveness is thus augmented.There is still another and far more striking peculiarity of the brush dischargeproduced by very rapidly alternating currents. To observe this it is best toreplace the usual terminals of the coil by two metal columns insulated with agood thickness of ebonite. It is also well to close all fissures and cracks withwax so that the brushes cannot form anywhere except at the tops of the columns.If the conditions are carefully adjusted—which, of course, must be left to theskill of the experimenter—so that the potential rises to an enormous value, onemay produce two powerful brushes several inches long, nearly white at theirroots, which in the dark bear a striking resemblance to two flames of a gasescaping under pressure (Fig. 110). But they do not only resemble, they areveritable flames, for they are hot. Certainly they are not as hot as a gasburner, but they would be so if the frequency and the potential would besufficiently high. Produced with, say, twenty thousand alternations per second,the heat is easily perceptible even if the potential is not excessively high.The heat developed is, of course, due to the impact of the air molecules againstthe terminals and against each other. As, at the ordinary pressures, the meanfree path is excessively small, it is possible that in spite of the enormousinitial speed imparted to each molecule upon coming in contact with theterminal, its progress—by collision with other molecules—is retarded to such anextent, that it does not get away far from the terminal, but may strike the samemany times in succession. The higher the frequency, the less the molecule isable to get away, and this the more so, as for a given effect the potentialrequired is smaller; and a frequency is conceivable—perhaps even obtainable—atwhich practically the same molecules would strike the terminal. Under suchconditions the exchange of the molecules would be very slow, and the heatproduced at, and very near, the terminal would be excessive. But if thefrequency would go on increasing constantly, the heat produced would begin todiminish for obvious reasons. In the positive brush of a static machine theexchange of the molecules is very rapid, the stream is constantly of onedirection, and there are fewer collisions; hence the heating effect must be verysmall. Anything that impairs the facility of exchange tends to increase thelocal heat produced. Thus, if a bulb be held over the terminal of the coil so asto enclose the brush, the air contained in the bulb is very quickly brought to ahigh temperature. If a glass tube be held over the brush so as to allow thedraught to carry the brush upwards, scorching hot air escapes at the top of thetube. Anything held within the brush is, of course, rapidly heated, and thepossibility of using such heating effects for some purpose or other suggestsitself.images [images/fig110.jpg]FIG. 110.When contemplating this singular phenomenon of the hot brush, we cannot helpbeing convinced that a similar process must take place in the ordinary flame,and it seems strange that after all these centuries past of familiarity with theflame, now, in this era of electric lighting and heating, we are finally led torecognize, that since time immemorial we have, after all, always had “electriclight and heat” at our disposal. It is also of no little interest tocontemplate, that we have a possible way of producing—by other than chemicalmeans—a veritable flame, which would give light and heat without any materialbeing consumed, without any chemical process taking place, and to accomplishthis, we only need to perfect methods of producing enormous frequencies andpotentials. I have no doubt that if the potential could be made to alternatewith sufficient rapidity and power, the brush formed at the end of a wire wouldlose its electrical characteristics and would become flamelike. The flame mustbe due to electrostatic molecular action.This phenomenon now explains in a manner which can hardly be doubted thefrequent accidents occurring in storms. It is well known that objects are oftenset on fire without the lightning striking them. We shall presently see how thiscan happen. On a nail in a roof, for instance, or on a projection of any kind,more or less conducting, or rendered so by dampness, a powerful brush mayappear. If the lightning strikes somewhere in the neighborhood the enormouspotential may be made to alternate or fluctuate perhaps many million times asecond. The air molecules are violently attracted and repelled, and by theirimpact produce such a powerful heating effect that a fire is started. It isconceivable that a ship at sea may, in this manner, catch fire at many points atonce. When we consider, that even with the comparatively low frequenciesobtained from a dynamo machine, and with potentials of no more than one or twohundred thousand volts, the heating effects are considerable, we may imagine howmuch more powerful they must be with frequencies and potentials many timesgreater; and the above explanation seems, to say the least, very probable.Similar explanations may have been suggested, but I am not aware that, up to thepresent, the heating effects of a brush produced by a rapidly alternatingpotential have been experimentally demonstrated, at least not to such aremarkable degree.By preventing completely the exchange of the air molecules, the local heatingeffect may be so exalted as to bring a body to incandescence. Thus, forinstance, if a small button, or preferably a very thin wire or filament beenclosed in an unexhausted globe and connected with the terminal of the coil, itmay be rendered incandescent. The phenomenon is made much more interesting bythe rapid spinning round in a circle of the top of the filament, thus presentingthe appearance of a luminous funnel, Fig. 111, which widens when the potentialis increased. When the potential is small the end of the filament may performirregular motions, suddenly changing from one to the other, or it may describean ellipse; but when the potential is very high it always spins in a circle; andso does generally a thin straight wire attached freely to the terminal of thecoil. These motions are, of course, due to the impact of the molecules, and theirregularity in the distribution of the potential, owing to the roughness anddissymmetry of the wire or filament. With a perfectly symmetrical and polishedwire such motions would probably not occur. That the motion is not likely to bedue to others causes is evident from the fact that it is not of a definitedirection, and that in a very highly exhausted globe it ceases altogether. Thepossibility of bringing a body to incandescence in an exhausted globe, or evenwhen not at all enclosed, would seem to afford a possible way of obtaining lighteffects, which, in perfecting methods of producing rapidly alternatingpotentials, might be rendered available for useful purposes.images [images/fig111.jpg]FIG. 111.In employing a commercial coil, the production of very powerful brush effects isattended with considerable difficulties, for when these high frequencies andenormous potentials are used, the best insulation is apt to give way. Usuallythe coil is insulated well enough to stand the strain from convolution toconvolution, since two double silk covered paraffined wires will withstand apressure of several thousand volts; the difficulty lies principally inpreventing the breaking through from the secondary to the primary, which isgreatly facilitated by the streams issuing from the latter. In the coil, ofcourse, the strain is greatest from section to section, but usually in a largercoil there are so many sections that the danger of a sudden giving way is notvery great. No difficulty will generally be encountered in that direction, andbesides, the liability of injuring the coil internally is very much reduced bythe fact that the effect most likely to be produced is simply a gradual heating,which, when far enough advanced, could not fail to be observed. The principalnecessity is then to prevent the streams between the primary and the tube, notonly on account of the heating and possible injury, but also because the streamsmay diminish very considerably the potential difference available at theterminals. A few hints as to how this may be accomplished will probably be founduseful in most of these experiments with the ordinary induction coil.One of the ways is to wind a short primary, Fig. 112a, so that the difference ofpotential is not at that length great enough to cause the breaking forth of thestreams through the insulating tube. The length of the primary should bedetermined by experiment. Both the ends of the coil should be brought out on oneend through a plug of insulating material fitting in the tube as illustrated. Insuch a disposition one terminal of the secondary is attached to a body, thesurface of which is determined with the greatest care so as to produce thegreatest rise in the potential. At the other terminal a powerful brush appears,which may be experimented upon.images [images/fig112a.jpg]FIG. 112a.The above plan necessitates the employment of a primary of comparatively smallsize, and it is apt to heat when powerful effects are desirable for a certainlength of time. In such a case it is better to employ a larger coil, Fig. 112b,and introduce it from one side of the tube, until the streams begin to appear.In this case the nearest terminal of the secondary may be connected to theprimary or to the ground, which is practically the same thing, if the primary isconnected directly to the machine. In the case of ground connections it is wellto determine experimentally the frequency which is best suited under theconditions of the test. Another way of obviating the streams, more or less, isto make the primary in sections and supply it from separate, well insulatedsources.images [images/fig112b.jpg]FIG. 112b.In many of these experiments, when powerful effects are wanted for a short time,it is advantageous to use iron cores with the primaries. In such case a verylarge primary coil may be wound and placed side by side with the secondary, and,the nearest terminal of the latter being connected to the primary, a laminatediron core is introduced through the primary into the secondary as far as thestreams will permit. Under these conditions an excessively powerful brush,several inches long, which may be appropriately called “St. Elmo’s hot fire,”may be caused to appear at the other terminal of the secondary, producingstriking effects. It is a most powerful ozonizer, so powerful indeed, that onlya few minutes are sufficient to fill the whole room with the smell of ozone, andit undoubtedly possesses the quality of exciting chemical affinities.For the production of ozone, alternating currents of very high frequency areeminently suited, not only on account of the advantages they offer in the way ofconversion but also because of the fact, that the ozonizing action of adischarge is dependent on the frequency as well as on the potential, this beingundoubtedly confirmed by observation.In these experiments if an iron core is used it should be carefully watched, asit is apt to get excessively hot in an incredibly short time. To give an idea ofthe rapidity of the heating, I will state, that by passing a powerful currentthrough a coil with many turns, the inserting within the same of a thin ironwire for no more than one second’s time is sufficient to heat the wire tosomething like 100°C.But this rapid heating need not discourage us in the use of iron cores inconnection with rapidly alternating currents. I have for a long time beenconvinced that in the industrial distribution by means of transformers, somesuch plan as the following might be practicable. We may use a comparativelysmall iron core, subdivided, or perhaps not even subdivided. We may surroundthis core with a considerable thickness of material which is fire-proof andconducts the heat poorly, and on top of that we may place the primary andsecondary windings. By using either higher frequencies or greater magnetizingforces, we may by hysteresis and eddy currents heat the iron core so far as tobring it nearly to its maximum permeability, which, as Hopkinson has shown, maybe as much as sixteen times greater than that at ordinary temperatures. If theiron core were perfectly enclosed, it would not be deteriorated by the heat,and, if the enclosure of fire-proof material would be sufficiently thick, only alimited amount of energy could be radiated in spite of the high temperature.Transformers have been constructed by me on that plan, but for lack of time, nothorough tests have as yet been made.Another way of adapting the iron core to rapid alternations, or, generallyspeaking, reducing the frictional losses, is to produce by continuousmagnetization a flow of something like seven thousand or eight thousand linesper square centimeter through the core, and then work with weak magnetizingforces and preferably high frequencies around the point of greatestpermeability. A higher efficiency of conversion and greater output areobtainable in this manner. I have also employed this principle in connectionwith machines in which there is no reversal of polarity. In these types ofmachines, as long as there are only few pole projections, there is no greatgain, as the maxima and minima of magnetization are far from the point ofmaximum permeability; but when the number of the pole projections is very great,the required rate of change may be obtained, without the magnetization varyingso far as to depart greatly from the point of maximum permeability, and the gainis considerable.The above described arrangements refer only to the use of commercial coils asordinarily constructed. If it is desired to construct a coil for the expresspurpose of performing with it such experiments as I have described, or,generally, rendering it capable of withstanding the greatest possible differenceof potential, then a construction as indicated in Fig. 113 will be found ofadvantage. The coil in this case is formed of two independent parts which arewound oppositely, the connection between both being made near the primary. Thepotential in the middle being zero, there is not much tendency to jump to theprimary and not much insulation is required. In some cases the middle point may,however, be connected to the primary or to the ground. In such a coil the placesof greatest difference of potential are far apart and the coil is capable ofwithstanding an enormous strain. The two parts may be movable so as to allow aslight adjustment of the capacity effect.images [images/fig113.jpg]FIG. 113.As to the manner of insulating the coil, it will be found convenient to proceedin the following way: First, the wire should be boiled in paraffin until all theair is out; then the coil is wound by running the wire through melted paraffin,merely for the purpose of fixing the wire. The coil is then taken off from thespool, immersed in a cylindrical vessel filled with pure melted wax and boiledfor a long time until the bubbles cease to appear. The whole is then left tocool down thoroughly, and then the mass is taken out of the vessel and turned upin a lathe. A coil made in this manner and with care is capable of withstandingenormous potential differences.It may be found convenient to immerse the coil in paraffin oil or some otherkind of oil; it is a most effective way of insulating, principally on account ofthe perfect exclusion of air, but it may be found that, after all, a vesselfilled with oil is not a very convenient thing to handle in a laboratory.If an ordinary coil can be dismounted, the primary may be taken out of the tubeand the latter plugged up at one end, filled with oil, and the primaryreinserted. This affords an excellent insulation and prevents the formation ofthe streams.Of all the experiments which may be performed with rapidly alternating currentsthe most interesting are those which concern the production of a practicalilluminant. It cannot be denied that the present methods, though they werebrilliant advances, are very wasteful. Some better methods must be invented,some more perfect apparatus devised. Modern research has opened newpossibilities for the production of an efficient source of light, and theattention of all has been turned in the direction indicated by able pioneers.Many have been carried away by the enthusiasm and passion to discover, but intheir zeal to reach results, some have been misled. Starting with the idea ofproducing electro-magnetic waves, they turned their attention, perhaps, too muchto the study of electro-magnetic effects, and neglected the study ofelectrostatic phenomena. Naturally, nearly every investigator availed himself ofan apparatus similar to that used in earlier experiments. But in those forms ofapparatus, while the electro-magnetic inductive effects are enormous, theelectrostatic effects are excessively small.In the Hertz experiments, for instance, a high tension induction coil is shortcircuited by an arc, the resistance of which is very small, the smaller, themore capacity is attached to the terminals; and the difference of potential atthese is enormously diminished. On the other hand, when the discharge is notpassing between the terminals, the static effects may be considerable, but onlyqualitatively so, not quantitatively, since their rise and fall is very sudden,and since their frequency is small. In neither case, therefore, are powerfulelectrostatic effects perceivable. Similar conditions exist when, as in someinteresting experiments of Dr. Lodge, Leyden jars are discharged disruptively.It has been thought—and I believe asserted—that in such cases most of the energyis radiated into space. In the light of the experiments which I have describedabove, it will now not be thought so. I feel safe in asserting that in suchcases most of the energy is partly taken up and converted into heat in the arcof the discharge and in the conducting and insulating material of the jar, someenergy being, of course, given off by electrification of the air; but the amountof the directly radiated energy is very small.When a high tension induction coil, operated by currents alternating only 20,000times a second, has its terminals closed through even a very small jar,practically all the energy passes through the dielectric of the jar, which isheated, and the electrostatic effects manifest themselves outwardly only to avery weak degree. Now the external circuit of a Leyden jar, that is, the arc andthe connections of the coatings, may be looked upon as a circuit generatingalternating currents of excessively high frequency and fairly high potential,which is closed through the coatings and the dielectric between them, and fromthe above it is evident that the external electrostatic effects must be verysmall, even if a recoil circuit be used. These conditions make it appear thatwith the apparatus usually at hand, the observation of powerful electrostaticeffects was impossible, and what experience has been gained in that direction isonly due to the great ability of the investigators.But powerful electrostatic effects are a sine qua non of light production on thelines indicated by theory. Electro-magnetic effects are primarily unavailable,for the reason that to produce the required effects we would have to passcurrent impulses through a conductor, which, long before the required frequencyof the impulses could be reached, would cease to transmit them. On the otherhand, electro-magnetic waves many times longer than those of light, andproducible by sudden discharge of a condenser, could not be utilized, it wouldseem, except we avail ourselves of their effect upon conductors as in thepresent methods, which are wasteful. We could not affect by means of such wavesthe static molecular or atomic charges of a gas, cause them to vibrate and toemit light. Long transverse waves cannot, apparently, produce such effects,since excessively small electro-magnetic disturbances may pass readily throughmiles of air. Such dark waves, unless they are of the length of true lightwaves, cannot, it would seem, excite luminous radiation in a Geissler tube, andthe luminous effects, which are producible by induction in a tube devoid ofelectrodes, I am inclined to consider as being of an electrostatic nature.To produce such luminous effects, straight electrostatic thrusts are required;these, whatever be their frequency, may disturb the molecular charges andproduce light. Since current impulses of the required frequency cannot passthrough a conductor of measurable dimensions, we must work with a gas, and thenthe production of powerful electrostatic effects becomes an imperativenecessity.It has occurred to me, however, that electrostatic effects are in many waysavailable for the production of light. For instance, we may place a body of somerefractory material in a closed, and preferably more or less exhausted, globe,connect it to a source of high, rapidly alternating potential, causing themolecules of the gas to strike it many times a second at enormous speeds, and inthis manner, with trillions of invisible hammers, pound it until it getsincandescent; or we may place a body in a very highly exhausted globe, in anon-striking vacuum, and, by employing very high frequencies and potentials,transfer sufficient energy from it to other bodies in the vicinity, or ingeneral to the surroundings, to maintain it at any degree of incandescence; orwe may, by means of such rapidly alternating high potentials, disturb the ethercarried by the molecules of a gas or their static charges, causing them tovibrate and to emit light.But, electrostatic effects being dependent upon the potential and frequency, toproduce the most powerful action it is desirable to increase both as far aspracticable. It may be possible to obtain quite fair results by keeping eitherof these factors small, provided the other is sufficiently great; but we arelimited in both directions. My experience demonstrates that we cannot go below acertain frequency, for, first, the potential then becomes so great that it isdangerous; and, secondly, the light production is less efficient.I have found that, by using the ordinary low frequencies, the physiologicaleffect of the current required to maintain at a certain degree of brightness atube four feet long, provided at the ends with outside and inside condensercoatings, is so powerful that, I think, it might produce serious injury to thosenot accustomed to such shocks; whereas, with twenty thousand alternations persecond, the tube may be maintained at the same degree of brightness without anyeffect being felt. This is due principally to the fact that a much smallerpotential is required to produce the same light effect, and also to the higherefficiency in the light production. It is evident that the efficiency in suchcases is the greater, the higher the frequency, for the quicker the process ofcharging and discharging the molecules, the less energy will be lost in the formof dark radiation. But, unfortunately, we cannot go beyond a certain frequencyon account of the difficulty of producing and conveying the effects.I have stated above that a body inclosed in an unexhausted bulb may be intenselyheated by simply connecting it with a source of rapidly alternating potential.The heating in such a case is, in all probability, due mostly to the bombardmentof the molecules of the gas contained in the bulb. When the bulb is exhausted,the heating of the body is much more rapid, and there is no difficulty whateverin bringing a wire or filament to any degree of incandescence by simplyconnecting it to one terminal of a coil of the proper dimensions. Thus, if thewell-known apparatus of Prof. Crookes, consisting of a bent platinum wire withvanes mounted over it (Fig. 114), be connected to one terminal of thecoil—either one or both ends of the platinum wire being connected—the wire isrendered almost instantly incandescent, and the mica vanes are rotated as thougha current from a battery were used. A thin carbon filament, or, preferably, abutton of some refractory material (Fig. 115), even if it be a comparativelypoor conductor, inclosed in an exhausted globe, may be rendered highlyincandescent; and in this manner a simple lamp capable of giving any desiredcandle power is provided.images [images/fig114.jpg]FIG. 114.images [images/fig115.jpg]FIG. 115.The success of lamps of this kind would depend largely on the selection of thelight-giving bodies contained within the bulb. Since, under the conditionsdescribed, refractory bodies—which are very poor conductors and capable ofwithstanding for a long time excessively high degrees of temperature—may beused, such illuminating devices may be rendered successful.It might be thought at first that if the bulb, containing the filament or buttonof refractory material, be perfectly well exhausted—that is, as far as it can bedone by the use of the best apparatus—the heating would be much less intense,and that in a perfect vacuum it could not occur at all. This is not confirmed bymy experience; quite the contrary, the better the vacuum the more easily thebodies are brought to incandescence. This result is interesting for manyreasons.At the outset of this work the idea presented itself to me, whether two bodiesof refractory material enclosed in a bulb exhausted to such a degree that thedischarge of a large induction coil, operated in the usual manner, cannot passthrough, could be rendered incandescent by mere condenser action. Obviously, toreach this result enormous potential differences and very high frequencies arerequired, as is evident from a simple calculation.But such a lamp would possess a vast advantage over an ordinary incandescentlamp in regard to efficiency. It is well-known that the efficiency of a lamp isto some extent a function of the degree of incandescence, and that, could we butwork a filament at many times higher degrees of incandescence, the efficiencywould be much greater. In an ordinary lamp this is impracticable on account ofthe destruction of the filament, and it has been determined by experience howfar it is advisable to push the incandescence. It is impossible to tell how muchhigher efficiency could be obtained if the filament could withstandindefinitely, as the investigation to this end obviously cannot be carriedbeyond a certain stage; but there are reasons for believing that it would bevery considerably higher. An improvement might be made in the ordinary lamp byemploying a short and thick carbon; but then the leading-in wires would have tobe thick, and, besides, there are many other considerations which render such amodification entirely impracticable. But in a lamp as above described, theleading in wires may be very small, the incandescent refractory material may bein the shape of blocks offering a very small radiating surface, so that lessenergy would be required to keep them at the desired incandescence; and inaddition to this, the refractory material need not be carbon, but may bemanufactured from mixtures of oxides, for instance, with carbon or othermaterial, or may be selected from bodies which are practically non-conductors,and capable of withstanding enormous degrees of temperature.All this would point to the possibility of obtaining a much higher efficiencywith such a lamp than is obtainable in ordinary lamps. In my experience it hasbeen demonstrated that the blocks are brought to high degrees of incandescencewith much lower potentials than those determined by calculation, and the blocksmay be set at greater distances from each other. We may freely assume, and it isprobable, that the molecular bombardment is an important element in the heating,even if the globe be exhausted with the utmost care, as I have done; foralthough the number of the molecules is, comparatively speaking, insignificant,yet on account of the mean free path being very great, there are fewercollisions, and the molecules may reach much higher speeds, so that the heatingeffect due to this cause may be considerable, as in the Crookes experiments withradiant matter.But it is likewise possible that we have to deal here with an increased facilityof losing the charge in very high vacuum, when the potential is rapidlyalternating, in which case most of the heating would be directly due to thesurging of the charges in the heated bodies. Or else the observed fact may belargely attributable to the effect of the points which I have mentioned above,in consequence of which the blocks or filaments contained in the vacuum areequivalent to condensers of many times greater surface than that calculated fromtheir geometrical dimensions. Scientific men still differ in opinion as towhether a charge should, or should not, be lost in a perfect vacuum, or in otherwords, whether ether is, or is not, a conductor. If the former were the case,then a thin filament enclosed in a perfectly exhausted globe, and connected to asource of enormous, steady potential, would be brought to incandescence.Various forms of lamps on the above described principle, with the refractorybodies in the form of filaments, Fig. 116, or blocks, Fig. 117, have beenconstructed and operated by me, and investigations are being carried on in thisline. There is no difficulty in reaching such high degrees of incandescence thatordinary carbon is to all appearance melted and volatilized. If the vacuum couldbe made absolutely perfect, such a lamp, although inoperative with apparatusordinarily used, would, if operated with currents of the required character,afford an illuminant which would never be destroyed, and which would be far moreefficient than an ordinary incandescent lamp. This perfection can, of course,never be reached, and a very slow destruction and gradual diminution in sizealways occurs, as in incandescent filaments; but there is no possibility of asudden and premature disabling which occurs in the latter by the breaking of thefilament, especially when the incandescent bodies are in the shape of blocks.images [images/fig116.jpg]FIG. 116.images [images/fig117.jpg]FIG. 117.With these rapidly alternating potentials there is, however, no necessity ofenclosing two blocks in a globe, but a single block, as in Fig. 115, orfilament, Fig. 118, may be used. The potential in this case must of course behigher, but is easily obtainable, and besides it is not necessarily dangerous.images [images/fig118.jpg]FIG. 118.The facility with which the button or filament in such a lamp is brought toincandescence, other things being equal, depends on the size of the globe. If aperfect vacuum could be obtained, the size of the globe would not be ofimportance, for then the heating would be wholly due to the surging of thecharges, and all the energy would be given off to the surroundings by radiation.But this can never occur in practice. There is always some gas left in theglobe, and although the exhaustion may be carried to the highest degree, stillthe space inside of the bulb must be considered as conducting when such highpotentials are used, and I assume that, in estimating the energy that may begiven off from the filament to the surroundings, we may consider the insidesurface of the bulb as one coating of a condenser, the air and other objectssurrounding the bulb forming the other coating. When the alternations are verylow there is no doubt that a considerable portion of the energy is given off bythe electrification of the surrounding air.In order to study this subject better, I carried on some experiments withexcessively high potentials and low frequencies. I then observed that when thehand is approached to the bulb—the filament being connected with one terminal ofthe coil—a powerful vibration is felt, being due to the attraction and repulsionof the molecules of the air which are electrified by induction through theglass. In some cases when the action is very intense I have been able to hear asound, which must be due to the same cause.When the alternations are low, one is apt to get an excessively powerful shockfrom the bulb. In general, when one attaches bulbs or objects of some size tothe terminals of the coil, one should look out for the rise of potential, for itmay happen that by merely connecting a bulb or plate to the terminal, thepotential may rise to many times its original value. When lamps are attached tothe terminals, as illustrated in Fig. 119, then the capacity of the bulbs shouldbe such as to give the maximum rise of potential under the existing conditions.In this manner one may obtain the required potential with fewer turns of wire.images [images/fig119.jpg]FIG. 119.The life of such lamps as described above depends, of course, largely on thedegree of exhaustion, but to some extent also on the shape of the block ofrefractory material. Theoretically it would seem that a small sphere of carbonenclosed in a sphere of glass would not suffer deterioration from molecularbombardment, for, the matter in the globe being radiant, the molecules wouldmove in straight lines, and would seldom strike the sphere obliquely. Aninteresting thought in connection with such a lamp is, that in it “electricity”and electrical energy apparently must move in the same lines.The use of alternating currents of very high frequency makes it possible totransfer, by electrostatic or electromagnetic induction through the glass of alamp, sufficient energy to keep a filament at incandescence and so do away withthe leading-in wires. Such lamps have been proposed, but for want of properapparatus they have not been successfully operated. Many forms of lamps on thisprinciple with continuous and broken filaments have been constructed by me andexperimented upon. When using a secondary enclosed within the lamp, a condenseris advantageously combined with the secondary. When the transference is effectedby electrostatic induction, the potentials used are, of course, very high withfrequencies obtainable from a machine. For instance, with a condenser surface offorty square centimeters, which is not impracticably large, and with glass ofgood quality 1 mm. thick, using currents alternating twenty thousand times asecond, the potential required is approximately 9,000 volts. This may seemlarge, but since each lamp may be included in the secondary of a transformer ofvery small dimensions, it would not be inconvenient, and, moreover, it would notproduce fatal injury. The transformers would all be preferably in series. Theregulation would offer no difficulties, as with currents of such frequencies itis very easy to maintain a constant current.In the accompanying engravings some of the types of lamps of this kind areshown. Fig. 120 is such a lamp with a broken filament, and Figs. 121a and 121bone with a single outside and inside coating and a single filament. I have alsomade lamps with two outside and inside coatings and a continuous loop connectingthe latter. Such lamps have been operated by me with current impulses of theenormous frequencies obtainable by the disruptive discharge of condensers.images [images/fig120.jpg]FIG. 120.images [images/fig121a.jpg]FIG. 121a.images [images/fig121b.jpg]FIG. 121b.The disruptive discharge of a condenser is especially suited for operating suchlamps—with no outward electrical connections—by means of electromagneticinduction, the electromagnetic inductive effects being excessively high; and Ihave been able to produce the desired incandescence with only a few short turnsof wire. Incandescence may also be produced in this manner in a simple closedfilament.Leaving now out of consideration the practicability of such lamps, I would onlysay that they possess a beautiful and desirable feature, namely, that they canbe rendered, at will, more or less brilliant simply by altering the relativeposition of the outside and inside condenser coatings, or inducing and inducedcircuits.When a lamp is lighted by connecting it to one terminal only of the source, thismay be facilitated by providing the globe with an outside condenser coating,which serves at the same time as a reflector, and connecting this to aninsulated body of some size. Lamps of this kind are illustrated in Fig. 122 andFig. 123. Fig. 124 shows the plan of connection. The brilliancy of the lamp may,in this case, be regulated within wide limits by varying the size of theinsulated metal plate to which the coating is connected.images [images/fig122.jpg]FIG. 122.images [images/fig123.jpg]FIG. 123.images [images/fig124.jpg]FIG. 124.It is likewise practicable to light with one leading wire lamps such asillustrated in Fig. 116 and Fig. 117, by connecting one terminal of the lamp toone terminal of the source, and the other to an insulated body of the requiredsize. In all cases the insulated body serves to give off the energy into thesurrounding space, and is equivalent to a return wire. Obviously, in the twolast-named cases, instead of connecting the wires to an insulated body,connections may be made to the ground.The experiments which will prove most suggestive and of most interest to theinvestigator are probably those performed with exhausted tubes. As might beanticipated, a source of such rapidly alternating potentials is capable ofexciting the tubes at a considerable distance, and the light effects producedare remarkable.During my investigations in this line I endeavored to excite tubes, devoid ofany electrodes, by electromagnetic induction, making the tube the secondary ofthe induction device, and passing through the primary the discharges of a Leydenjar. These tubes were made of many shapes, and I was able to obtain luminouseffects which I then thought were due wholly to electromagnetic induction. Buton carefully investigating the phenomena I found that the effects produced weremore of an electrostatic nature. It may be attributed to this circumstance thatthis mode of exciting tubes is very wasteful, namely, the primary circuit beingclosed, the potential, and consequently the electrostatic inductive effect, ismuch diminished.When an induction coil, operated as above described, is used, there is no doubtthat the tubes are excited by electrostatic induction, and that electromagneticinduction has little, if anything, to do with the phenomena.This is evident from many experiments. For instance, if a tube be taken in onehand, the observer being near the coil, it is brilliantly lighted and remains sono matter in what position it is held relatively to the observer’s body. Werethe action electromagnetic, the tube could not be lighted when the observer’sbody is interposed between it and the coil, or at least its luminosity should beconsiderably diminished. When the tube is held exactly over the center of thecoil—the latter being wound in sections and the primary placed symmetrically tothe secondary—it may remain completely dark, whereas it is rendered intenselyluminous by moving it slightly to the right or left from the center of the coil.It does not light because in the middle both halves of the coil neutralize eachother, and the electric potential is zero. If the action were electromagnetic,the tube should light best in the plane through the center of the coil, sincethe electromagnetic effect there should be a maximum. When an arc is establishedbetween the terminals, the tubes and lamps in the vicinity of the coil go out,but light up again when the arc is broken, on account of the rise of potential.Yet the electromagnetic effect should be practically the same in both cases.By placing a tube at some distance from the coil, and nearer to oneterminal—preferably at a point on the axis of the coil—one may light it bytouching the remote terminal with an insulated body of some size or with thehand, thereby raising the potential at that terminal nearer to the tube. If thetube is shifted nearer to the coil so that it is lighted by the action of thenearer terminal, it may be made to go out by holding, on an insulated support,the end of a wire connected to the remote terminal, in the vicinity of thenearer terminal, by this means counteracting the action of the latter upon thetube. These effects are evidently electrostatic. Likewise, when a tube is placedat a considerable distance from the coil, the observer may, standing upon aninsulated support between coil and tube, light the latter by approaching thehand to it; or he may even render it luminous by simply stepping between it andthe coil. This would be impossible with electro-magnetic induction, for the bodyof the observer would act as a screen.When the coil is energized by excessively weak currents, the experimenter may,by touching one terminal of the coil with the tube, extinguish the latter, andmay again light it by bringing it out of contact with the terminal and allowinga small arc to form. This is clearly due to the respective lowering and raisingof the potential at that terminal. In the above experiment, when the tube islighted through a small arc, it may go out when the arc is broken, because theelectrostatic inductive effect alone is too weak, though the potential may bemuch higher; but when the arc is established, the electrification of the end ofthe tube is much greater, and it consequently lights.If a tube is lighted by holding it near to the coil, and in the hand which isremote, by grasping the tube anywhere with the other hand, the part between thehands is rendered dark, and the singular effect of wiping out the light of thetube may be produced by passing the hand quickly along the tube and at the sametime withdrawing it gently from the coil, judging properly the distance so thatthe tube remains dark afterwards.If the primary coil is placed sidewise, as in Fig. 112b for instance, and anexhausted tube be introduced from the other side in the hollow space, the tubeis lighted most intensely because of the increased condenser action, and in thisposition the striae are most sharply defined. In all these experimentsdescribed, and in many others, the action is clearly electrostatic.The effects of screening also indicate the electrostatic nature of the phenomenaand show something of the nature of electrification through the air. Forinstance, if a tube is placed in the direction of the axis of the coil, and aninsulated metal plate be interposed, the tube will generally increase inbrilliancy, or if it be too far from the coil to light, it may even be renderedluminous by interposing an insulated metal plate. The magnitude of the effectsdepends to some extent on the size of the plate. But if the metal plate beconnected by a wire to the ground, its interposition will always make the tubego out even if it be very near the coil. In general, the interposition of a bodybetween the coil and tube, increases or diminishes the brilliancy of the tube,or its facility to light up, according to whether it increases or diminishes theelectrification. When experimenting with an insulated plate, the plate shouldnot be taken too large, else it will generally produce a weakening effect byreason of its great facility for giving off energy to the surroundings.If a tube be lighted at some distance from the coil, and a plate of hard rubberor other insulating substance be interposed, the tube may be made to go out. Theinterposition of the dielectric in this case only slightly increases theinductive effect, but diminishes considerably the electrification through theair.In all cases, then, when we excite luminosity in exhausted tubes by means ofsuch a coil, the effect is due to the rapidly alternating electrostaticpotential; and, furthermore, it must be attributed to the harmonic alternationproduced directly by the machine, and not to any superimposed vibration whichmight be thought to exist. Such superimposed vibrations are impossible when wework with an alternate current machine. If a spring be gradually tightened andreleased, it does not perform independent vibrations; for this a sudden releaseis necessary. So with the alternate currents from a dynamo machine; the mediumis harmonically strained and released, this giving rise to only one kind ofwaves; a sudden contact or break, or a sudden giving way of the dielectric, asin the disruptive discharge of a Leyden jar, are essential for the production ofsuperimposed waves.In all the last described experiments, tubes devoid of any electrodes may beused, and there is no difficulty in producing by their means sufficient light toread by. The light effect is, however, considerably increased by the use ofphosphorescent bodies such as yttria, uranium glass, etc. A difficulty will befound when the phosphorescent material is used, for with these powerful effects,it is carried gradually away, and it is preferable to use material in the formof a solid.Instead of depending on induction at a distance to light the tube, the same maybe provided with an external—and, if desired, also with an internal—condensercoating, and it may then be suspended anywhere in the room from a conductorconnected to one terminal of the coil, and in this manner a soft illuminationmay be provided.The ideal way of lighting a hall or room would, however, be to produce such acondition in it that an illuminating device could be moved and put anywhere, andthat it is lighted, no matter where it is put and without being electricallyconnected to anything. I have been able to produce such a condition by creatingin the room a powerful, rapidly alternating electrostatic field. For thispurpose I suspend a sheet of metal a distance from the ceiling on insulatingcords and connect it to one terminal of the induction coil, the other terminalbeing preferably connected to the ground. Or else I suspend two sheets asillustrated in Fig. 125, each sheet being connected with one of the terminals ofthe coil, and their size being carefully determined. An exhausted tube may thenbe carried in the hand anywhere between the sheets or placed anywhere, even acertain distance beyond them; it remains always luminous.images [images/fig125.jpg]FIG. 125.In such an electrostatic field interesting phenomena may be observed, especiallyif the alternations are kept low and the potentials excessively high. Inaddition to the luminous phenomena mentioned, one may observe that any insulatedconductor gives sparks when the hand or another object is approached to it, andthe sparks may often be powerful. When a large conducting object is fastened onan insulating support, and the hand approached to it, a vibration, due to therythmical motion of the air molecules is felt, and luminous streams may beperceived when the hand is held near a pointed projection. When a telephonereceiver is made to touch with one or both of its terminals an insulatedconductor of some size, the telephone emits a loud sound; it also emits a soundwhen a length of wire is attached to one or both terminals, and with verypowerful fields a sound may be perceived even without any wire.How far this principle is capable of practical application, the future willtell. It might be thought that electrostatic effects are unsuited for suchaction at a distance. Electromagnetic inductive effects, if available for theproduction of light, might be thought better suited. It is true theelectrostatic effects diminish nearly with the cube of the distance from thecoil, whereas the electromagnetic inductive effects diminish simply with thedistance. But when we establish an electrostatic field of force, the conditionis very different, for then, instead of the differential effect of both theterminals, we get their conjoint effect. Besides, I would call attention to theeffect, that in an alternating electrostatic field, a conductor, such as anexhausted tube, for instance, tends to take up most of the energy, whereas in anelectromagnetic alternating field the conductor tends to take up the leastenergy, the waves being reflected with but little loss. This is one reason whyit is difficult to excite an exhausted tube, at a distance, by electromagneticinduction. I have wound coils of very large diameter and of many turns of wire,and connected a Geissler tube to the ends of the coil with the object ofexciting the tube at a distance; but even with the powerful inductive effectsproducible by Leyden jar discharges, the tube could not be excited unless at avery small distance, although some judgment was used as to the dimensions of thecoil. I have also found that even the most powerful Leyden jar discharges arecapable of exciting only feeble luminous effects in a closed exhausted tube, andeven these effects upon thorough examination I have been forced to consider ofan electrostatic nature.How then can we hope to produce the required effects at a distance by means ofelectromagnetic action, when even in the closest proximity to the source ofdisturbance, under the most advantageous conditions, we can excite but faintluminosity? It is true that when acting at a distance we have the resonance tohelp us out. We can connect an exhausted tube, or whatever the illuminatingdevice may be, with an insulated system of the proper capacity, and so it may bepossible to increase the effect qualitatively, and only qualitatively, for wewould not get more energy through the device. So we may, by resonance effect,obtain the required electromotive force in an exhausted tube, and excite faintluminous effects, but we cannot get enough energy to render the lightpractically available, and a simple calculation, based on experimental results,shows that even if all the energy which a tube would receive at a certaindistance from the source should be wholly converted into light, it would hardlysatisfy the practical requirements. Hence the necessity of directing, by meansof a conducting circuit, the energy to the place of transformation. But in sodoing we cannot very sensibly depart from present methods, and all we could dowould be to improve the apparatus.From these considerations it would seem that if this ideal way of lighting is tobe rendered practicable it will be only by the use of electrostatic effects. Insuch a case the most powerful electrostatic inductive effects are needed; theapparatus employed must, therefore, be capable of producing high electrostaticpotentials changing in value with extreme rapidity. High frequencies areespecially wanted, for practical considerations make it desirable to keep downthe potential. By the employment of machines, or, generally speaking, of anymechanical apparatus, but low frequencies can be reached; recourse must,therefore, be had to some other means. The discharge of a condenser affords us ameans of obtaining frequencies by far higher than are obtainable mechanically,and I have accordingly employed condensers in the experiments to the above end.When the terminals of a high tension induction coil, Fig. 126, are connected toa Leyden jar, and the latter is discharging disruptively into a circuit, we maylook upon the arc playing between the knobs as being a source of alternating, orgenerally speaking, undulating currents, and then we have to deal with thefamiliar system of a generator of such currents, a circuit connected to it, anda condenser bridging the circuit. The condenser in such case is a veritabletransformer, and since the frequency is excessive, almost any ratio in thestrength of the currents in both the branches may be obtained. In reality theanalogy is not quite complete, for in the disruptive discharge we have mostgenerally a fundamental instantaneous variation of comparatively low frequency,and a superimposed harmonic vibration, and the laws governing the flow ofcurrents are not the same for both.images [images/fig126.jpg]FIG. 126.In converting in this manner, the ratio of conversion should not be too great,for the loss in the arc between the knobs increases with the square of thecurrent, and if the jar be discharged through very thick and short conductors,with the view of obtaining a very rapid oscillation, a very considerable portionof the energy stored is lost. On the other hand, too small ratios are notpracticable for many obvious reasons.As the converted currents flow in a practically closed circuit, theelectrostatic effects are necessarily small, and I therefore convert them intocurrents or effects of the required character. I have effected such conversionsin several ways. The preferred plan of connections is illustrated in Fig. 127.The manner of operating renders it easy to obtain by means of a small andinexpensive apparatus enormous differences of potential which have been usuallyobtained by means of large and expensive coils. For this it is only necessary totake an ordinary small coil, adjust to it a condenser and discharging circuit,forming the primary of an auxiliary small coil, and convert upward. As theinductive effect of the primary currents is excessively great, the second coilneed have comparatively but very few turns. By properly adjusting the elements,remarkable results may be secured.images [images/fig127.jpg]FIG. 127.In endeavoring to obtain the required electrostatic effects in this manner, Ihave, as might be expected, encountered many difficulties which I have beengradually overcoming, but I am not as yet prepared to dwell upon my experiencesin this direction.I believe that the disruptive discharge of a condenser will play an importantpart in the future, for it offers vast possibilities, not only in the way ofproducing light in a more efficient manner and in the line indicated by theory,but also in many other respects.For years the efforts of inventors have been directed towards obtainingelectrical energy from heat by means of the thermopile. It might seem invidiousto remark that but few know what is the real trouble with the thermopile. It isnot the inefficiency or small output—though these are great drawbacks—but thefact that the thermopile has its phylloxera, that is, that by constant use it isdeteriorated, which has thus far prevented its introduction on an industrialscale. Now that all modern research seems to point with certainty to the use ofelectricity of excessively high tension, the question must present itself tomany whether it is not possible to obtain in a practicable manner this form ofenergy from heat. We have been used to look upon an electrostatic machine as aplaything, and somehow we couple with it the idea of the inefficient andimpractical. But now we must think differently, for now we know that everywherewe have to deal with the same forces, and that it is a mere question ofinventing proper methods or apparatus for rendering them available.In the present systems of electrical distribution, the employment of the ironwith its wonderful magnetic properties allows us to reduce considerably the sizeof the apparatus; but, in spite of this, it is still very cumbersome. The morewe progress in the study of electric and magnetic phenomena, the more we becomeconvinced that the present methods will be short-lived. For the production oflight, at least, such heavy machinery would seem to be unnecessary. The energyrequired is very small, and if light can be obtained as efficiently as,theoretically, it appears possible, the apparatus need have but a very smalloutput. There being a strong probability that the illuminating methods of thefuture will involve the use of very high potentials, it seems very desirable toperfect a contrivance capable of converting the energy of heat into energy ofthe requisite form. Nothing to speak of has been done towards this end, for thethought that electricity of some 50,000 or 100,000 volts pressure or more, evenif obtained, would be unavailable for practical purposes, has deterred inventorsfrom working in this direction.In Fig. 126 a plan of connections is shown for converting currents of high, intocurrents of low, tension by means of the disruptive discharge of a condenser.This plan has been used by me frequently for operating a few incandescent lampsrequired in the laboratory. Some difficulties have been encountered in the arcof the discharge which I have been able to overcome to a great extent; besidesthis, and the adjustment necessary for the proper working, no other difficultieshave been met with, and it was easy to operate ordinary lamps, and even motors,in this manner. The line being connected to the ground, all the wires could behandled with perfect impunity, no matter how high the potential at the terminalsof the condenser. In these experiments a high tension induction coil, operatedfrom a battery or from an alternate current machine, was employed to charge thecondenser; but the induction coil might be replaced by an apparatus of adifferent kind, capable of giving electricity of such high tension. In thismanner, direct or alternating currents may be converted, and in both cases thecurrent-impulses may be of any desired frequency. When the currents charging thecondenser are of the same direction, and it is desired that the convertedcurrents should also be of one direction, the resistance of the dischargingcircuit should, of course, be so chosen that there are no oscillations.In operating devices on the above plan I have observed curious phenomena ofimpedance which are of interest. For instance if a thick copper bar be bent, asindicated in Fig. 128, and shunted by ordinary incandescent lamps, then, bypassing the discharge between the knobs, the lamps may be brought toincandescence although they are short-circuited. When a large induction coil isemployed it is easy to obtain nodes on the bar, which are rendered evident bythe different degree of brilliancy of the lamps, as shown roughly in Fig. 128.The nodes are never clearly defined, but they are simply maxima and minima ofpotentials along the bar. This is probably due to the irregularity of the arcbetween the knobs. In general when the above-described plan of conversion fromhigh to low tension is used, the behavior of the disruptive discharge may beclosely studied. The nodes may also be investigated by means of an ordinaryCardew voltmeter which should be well insulated. Geissler tubes may also belighted across the points of the bent bar; in this case, of course, it is betterto employ smaller capacities. I have found it practicable to light up in thismanner a lamp, and even a Geissler tube, shunted by a short, heavy block ofmetal, and this result seems at first very curious. In fact, the thicker thecopper bar in Fig. 128, the better it is for the success of the experiments, asthey appear more striking. When lamps with long slender filaments are used itwill be often noted that the filaments are from time to time violently vibrated,the vibration being smallest at the nodal points. This vibration seems to be dueto an electrostatic action between the filament and the glass of the bulb.images [images/fig128.jpg]FIG. 128.In some of the above experiments it is preferable to use special lamps having astraight filament as shown in Fig. 129. When such a lamp is used a still morecurious phenomenon than those described may be observed. The lamp may be placedacross the copper bar and lighted, and by using somewhat larger capacities, or,in other words, smaller frequencies or smaller impulsive impedances, thefilament may be brought to any desired degree of incandescence. But when theimpedance is increased, a point is reached when comparatively little currentpasses through the carbon, and most of it through the rarefied gas; or perhapsit may be more correct to state that the current divides nearly evenly throughboth, in spite of the enormous difference in the resistance, and this would betrue unless the gas and the filament behave differently. It is then noted thatthe whole bulb is brilliantly illuminated, and the ends of the leading-in wiresbecome incandescent and often throw off sparks in consequence of the violentbombardment, but the carbon filament remains dark. This is illustrated in Fig.129. Instead of the filament a single wire extending through the whole bulb maybe used, and in this case the phenomenon would seem to be still moreinteresting.images [images/fig129.jpg]FIG. 129.From the above experiment it will be evident, that when ordinary lamps areoperated by the converted currents, those should be preferably taken in whichthe platinum wires are far apart, and the frequencies used should not be toogreat, else the discharge will occur at the ends of the filament or in the baseof the lamp between the leading-in wires, and the lamp might then be damaged.In presenting to you these results of my investigation on the subject underconsideration, I have paid only a passing notice to facts upon which I couldhave dwelt at length, and among many observations I have selected only thosewhich I thought most likely to interest you. The field is wide and completelyunexplored, and at every step a new truth is gleaned, a novel fact observed.How far the results here borne out are capable of practical applications will bedecided in the future. As regards the production of light, some results alreadyreached are encouraging and make me confident in asserting that the practicalsolution of the problem lies in the direction I have endeavored to indicate.Still, whatever may be the immediate outcome of these experiments I am hopefulthat they will only prove a step in further development towards the ideal andfinal perfection. The possibilities which are opened by modern research are sovast that even the most reserved must feel sanguine of the future. Eminentscientists consider the problem of utilizing one kind of radiation without theothers a rational one. In an apparatus designed for the production of light byconversion from any form of energy into that of light, such a result can neverbe reached, for no matter what the process of producing the required vibrations,be it electrical, chemical or any other, it will not be possible to obtain thehigher light vibrations without going through the lower heat vibrations. It isthe problem of imparting to a body a certain velocity without passing throughall lower velocities. But there is a possibility of obtaining energy not only inthe form of light, but motive power, and energy of any other form, in some moredirect way from the medium. The time will be when this will be accomplished, andthe time has come when one may utter such words before an enlightened audiencewithout being considered a visionary. We are whirling through endless space withan inconceivable speed, all around us everything is spinning, everything ismoving, everywhere is energy. There must be some way of availing ourselves ofthis energy more directly. Then, with the light obtained from the medium, withthe power derived from it, with every form of energy obtained without effort,from the store forever inexhaustible, humanity will advance with giant strides.The mere contemplation of these magnificent possibilities expands our minds,strengthens our hopes and fills our hearts with supreme delight.______________________* A lecture delivered before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, atColumbia College, N.Y., May 20, 1891."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXVII [05_Contents.xhtml#r30]EXPERIMENTS WITH ALTERNATE CURRENTS OF HIGHPOTENTIAL AND HIGH FREQUENCY [05_Contents.xhtml#r30]*I cannot find words to express how deeply I feel the honor of addressing some ofthe foremost thinkers of the present time, and so many able scientific men,engineers and electricians, of the country greatest in scientific achievements.The results which I have the honor to present before such a gathering I cannotcall my own. There are among you not a few who can lay better claim than myselfon any feature of merit which this work may contain. I need not mention manynames which are world-known—names of those among you who are recognized as theleaders in this enchanting science; but one, at least, I must mention—a namewhich could not be omitted in a demonstration of this kind. It is a nameassociated with the most beautiful invention ever made: it is Crookes!When I was at college, a good while ago, I read, in a translation (for then Iwas not familiar with your magnificent language), the description of hisexperiments on radiant matter. I read it only once in my life—that time—yetevery detail about that charming work I can remember to this day. Few are thebooks, let me say, which can make such an impression upon the mind of a student.But if, on the present occasion, I mention this name as one of many yourInstitution can boast of, it is because I have more than one reason to do so.For what I have to tell you and to show you this evening concerns, in a largemeasure, that same vague world which Professor Crookes has so ably explored;and, more than this, when I trace back the mental process which led me to theseadvances—which even by myself cannot be considered trifling, since they are soappreciated by you—I believe that their real origin, that which started me towork in this direction, and brought me to them, after a long period of constantthought, was that fascinating little book which I read many years ago.And now that I have made a feeble effort to express my homage and acknowledge myindebtedness to him and others among you, I will make a second effort, which Ihope you will not find so feeble as the first, to entertain you.Give me leave to introduce the subject in a few words.A short time ago I had the honor to bring before our American Institute ofElectrical Engineers some results then arrived at by me in a novel line of work.I need not assure you that the many evidences which I have received that Englishscientific men and engineers were interested in this work have been for me agreat reward and encouragement. I will not dwell upon the experiments alreadydescribed, except with the view of completing, or more clearly expressing, someideas advanced by me before, and also with the view of rendering the study herepresented self-contained, and my remarks on the subject of this evening’slecture consistent.This investigation, then, it goes without saying, deals with alternatingcurrents, and to be more precise, with alternating currents of high potentialand high frequency. Just in how much a very high frequency is essential for theproduction of the results presented is a question which, even with my presentexperience, would embarrass me to answer. Some of the experiments may beperformed with low frequencies; but very high frequencies are desirable, notonly on account of the many effects secured by their use, but also as aconvenient means of obtaining, in the induction apparatus employed, the highpotentials, which in their turn are necessary to the demonstration of most ofthe experiments here contemplated.Of the various branches of electrical investigation, perhaps the mostinteresting and the most immediately promising is that dealing with alternatingcurrents. The progress in this branch of applied science has been so great inrecent years that it justifies the most sanguine hopes. Hardly have we becomefamiliar with one fact, when novel experiences are met and new avenues ofresearch are opened. Even at this hour possibilities not dreamed of before are,by the use of these currents, partly realized. As in nature all is ebb and tide,all is wave motion, so it seems that in all branches of industry alternatingcurrents—electric wave motion—will have the sway.One reason, perhaps, why this branch of science is being so rapidly developed isto be found in the interest which is attached to its experimental study. We winda simple ring of iron with coils; we establish the connections to the generator,and with wonder and delight we note the effects of strange forces which we bringinto play, which allow us to transform, to transmit and direct energy at will.We arrange the circuits properly, and we see the mass of iron and wires behaveas though it were endowed with life, spinning a heavy armature, throughinvisible connections, with great speed and power—with the energy possiblyconveyed from a great distance. We observe how the energy of an alternatingcurrent traversing the wire manifests itself—not so much in the wire as in thesurrounding space—in the most surprising manner, taking the forms of heat,light, mechanical energy, and, most surprising of all, even chemical affinity.All these observations fascinate us, and fill us with an intense desire to knowmore about the nature of these phenomena. Each day we go to our work in the hopeof discovering—in the hope that someone, no matter who, may find a solution ofone of the pending great problems—and each succeeding day we return to our taskwith renewed ardor; and even if we are unsuccessful, our work has not been invain, for in these strivings, in these efforts, we have found hours of untoldpleasure, and we have directed our energies to the benefit of mankind.We may take—at random, if you choose—any of the many experiments which may beperformed with alternating currents; a few of which only, and by no means themost striking, form the subject of this evening’s demonstration; they are allequally interesting, equally inciting to thought.Here is a simple glass tube from which the air has been partially exhausted. Itake hold of it; I bring my body in contact with a wire conveying alternatingcurrents of high potential, and the tube in my hand is brilliantly lighted. Inwhatever position I may put it, wherever I move it in space, as far as I canreach, its soft, pleasing light persists with undiminished brightness.Here is an exhausted bulb suspended from a single wire. Standing on an insulatedsupport, I grasp it, and a platinum button mounted in it is brought to vividincandescence.Here, attached to a leading wire, is another bulb, which, as I touch itsmetallic socket, is filled with magnificent colors of phosphorescent light.Here still another, which by my fingers’ touch casts a shadow—the Crookesshadow—of the stem inside of it.Here, again, insulated as I stand on this platform, I bring my body in contactwith one of the terminals of the secondary of this induction coil—with the endof a wire many miles long—and you see streams of light break forth from itsdistant end, which is set in violent vibration.Here, once more, I attach these two plates of wire gauze to the terminals of thecoil; I set them a distance apart, and I set the coil to work. You may see asmall spark pass between the plates. I insert a thick plate of one of the bestdielectrics between them, and instead of rendering altogether impossible, as weare used to expect, I aid the passage of the discharge, which, as I insert theplate, merely changes in appearance and assumes the form of luminous streams.Is there, I ask, can there be, a more interesting study than that of alternatingcurrents?In all these investigations, in all these experiments, which are so very, veryinteresting, for many years past—ever since the greatest experimenter wholectured in this hall discovered its principle—we have had a steady companion,an appliance familiar to everyone, a plaything once, a thing of momentousimportance now—the induction coil. There is no dearer appliance to theelectrician. From the ablest among you, I dare say, down to the inexperiencedstudent, to your lecturer, we all have passed many delightful hours inexperimenting with the induction coil. We have watched its play, and thought andpondered over the beautiful phenomena which it disclosed to our ravished eyes.So well known is this apparatus, so familiar are these phenomena to everyone,that my courage nearly fails me when I think that I have ventured to address soable an audience, that I have ventured to entertain you with that same oldsubject. Here in reality is the same apparatus, and here are the same phenomena,only the apparatus is operated somewhat differently, the phenomena are presentedin a different aspect. Some of the results we find as expected, others surpriseus, but all captivate our attention, for in scientific investigation each novelresult achieved may be the center of a new departure, each novel fact learnedmay lead to important developments.Usually in operating an induction coil we have set up a vibration of moderatefrequency in the primary, either by means of an interrupter or break, or by theuse of an alternator. Earlier English investigators, to mention onlySpottiswoode and J. E. H. Gordon, have used a rapid break in connection with thecoil. Our knowledge and experience of today enables us to see clearly why thesecoils under the conditions of the test did not disclose any remarkablephenomena, and why able experimenters failed to perceive many of the curiouseffects which have since been observed.In the experiments such as performed this evening, we operate the coil eitherfrom a specially constructed alternator capable of giving many thousands ofreversals of current per second, or, by disruptively discharging a condenserthrough the primary, we set up a vibration in the secondary circuit of afrequency of many hundred thousand or millions per second, if we so desire; andin using either of these means we enter a field as yet unexplored.It is impossible to pursue an investigation in any novel line without finallymaking some interesting observation or learning some useful fact. That thisstatement is applicable to the subject of this lecture the many curious andunexpected phenomena which we observe afford a convincing proof. By way ofillustration, take for instance the most obvious phenomena, those of thedischarge of the induction coil.Here is a coil which is operated by currents vibrating with extreme rapidity,obtained by disruptively discharging a Leyden jar. It would not surprise astudent were the lecturer to say that the secondary of this coil consists of asmall length of comparatively stout wire; it would not surprise him were thelecturer to state that, in spite of this, the coil is capable of giving anypotential which the best insulation of the turns is able to withstand; butalthough he may be prepared, and even be indifferent as to the anticipatedresult, yet the aspect of the discharge of the coil will surprise and interesthim. Every one is familiar with the discharge of an ordinary coil; it need notbe reproduced here. But, by way of contrast, here is a form of discharge of acoil, the primary current of which is vibrating several hundred thousand timesper second. The discharge of an ordinary coil appears as a simple line or bandof light. The discharge of this coil appears in the form of powerful brushes andluminous streams issuing from all points of the two straight wires attached tothe terminals of the secondary. (Fig. 130.)images [images/fig130.jpg]FIG. 130.Now compare this phenomenon which you have just witnessed with the discharge ofa Holtz or Wimshurst machine—that other interesting appliance so dear to theexperimenter. What a difference there is between these phenomena! And yet, had Imade the necessary arrangements—which could have been made easily, were it notthat they would interfere with other experiments—I could have produced with thiscoil sparks which, had I the coil hidden from your view and only two knobsexposed, even the keenest observer among you would find it difficult, if notimpossible, to distinguish from those of an influence or friction machine. Thismay be done in many ways—for instance, by operating the induction coil whichcharges the condenser from an alternating-current machine of very low frequency,and preferably adjusting the discharge circuit so that there are no oscillationsset up in it. We then obtain in the secondary circuit, if the knobs are of therequired size and properly set, a more or less rapid succession of sparks ofgreat intensity and small quantity, which possess the same brilliancy, and areaccompanied by the same sharp crackling sound, as those obtained from a frictionor influence machine.Another way is to pass through two primary circuits, having a common secondary,two currents of a slightly different period, which produce in the secondarycircuit sparks occurring at comparatively long intervals. But, even with themeans at hand this evening, I may succeed in imitating the spark of a Holtzmachine. For this purpose I establish between the terminals of the coil whichcharges the condenser a long, unsteady arc, which is periodically interrupted bythe upward current of air produced by it. To increase the current of air I placeon each side of the arc, and close to it, a large plate of mica. The condensercharged from this coil discharges into the primary circuit of a second coilthrough a small air gap, which is necessary to produce a sudden rush of currentthrough the primary. The scheme of connections in the present experiment isindicated in Fig. 131.images [images/fig131.jpg]FIG. 131.G is an ordinarily constructed alternator, supplying the primary P of aninduction coil, the secondary S of which charges the condensers or jars C C. Theterminals of the secondary are connected to the inside coatings of the jars, theouter coatings being connected to the ends of the primary p p of a secondinduction coil. This primary p p has a small air gap a b.The secondary s of this coil is provided with knobs or spheres K K of the propersize and set at a distance suitable for the experiment.A long arc is established between the terminals A B of the first induction coil.M M are the mica plates.Each time the arc is broken between A and B the jars are quickly charged anddischarged through the primary p p, producing a snapping spark between the knobsK K. Upon the arc forming between A and B the potential falls, and the jarscannot be charged to such high potential as to break through the air gap a buntil the arc is again broken by the draught.In this manner sudden impulses, at long intervals, are produced in the primary pp, which in the secondary s give a corresponding number of impulses of greatintensity. If the secondary knobs or spheres, K K, are of the proper size, thesparks show much resemblance to those of a Holtz machine.But these two effects, which to the eye appear so very different, are only twoof the many discharge phenomena. We only need to change the conditions of thetest, and again we make other observations of interest.When, instead of operating the induction coil as in the last two experiments, weoperate it from a high frequency alternator, as in the next experiment, asystematic study of the phenomena is rendered much more easy. In such case, invarying the strength and frequency of the currents through the primary, we mayobserve five distinct forms of discharge, which I have described in my formerpaper on the subject before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, May20, 1891.It would take too much time, and it would lead us too far from the subjectpresented this evening, to reproduce all these forms, but it seems to medesirable to show you one of them. It is a brush discharge, which is interestingin more than one respect. Viewed from a near position it resembles much a jet ofgas escaping under great pressure. We know that the phenomenon is due to theagitation of the molecules near the terminal, and we anticipate that some heatmust be developed by the impact of the molecules against the terminal or againsteach other. Indeed, we find that the brush is hot, and only a little thoughtleads us to the conclusion that, could we but reach sufficiently highfrequencies, we could produce a brush which would give intense light and heat,and which would resemble in every particular an ordinary flame, save, perhaps,that both phenomena might not be due to the same agent—save, perhaps, thatchemical affinity might not be electrical in its nature.As the production of heat and light is here due to the impact of the molecules,or atoms of air, or something else besides, and, as we can augment the energysimply by raising the potential, we might, even with frequencies obtained from adynamo machine, intensify the action to such a degree as to bring the terminalto melting heat. But with such low frequencies we would have to deal always withsomething of the nature of an electric current. If I approach a conductingobject to the brush, a thin little spark passes, yet, even with the frequenciesused this evening, the tendency to spark is not very great. So, for instance, ifI hold a metallic sphere at some distance above the terminal, you may see thewhole space between the terminal and sphere illuminated by the streams withoutthe spark passing; and with the much higher frequencies obtainable by thedisruptive discharge of a condenser, were it not for the sudden impulses, whichare comparatively few in number, sparking would not occur even at very smalldistances. However, with incomparably higher frequencies, which we may yet findmeans to produce efficiently, and provided that electric impulses of such highfrequencies could be transmitted through a conductor, the electricalcharacteristics of the brush discharge would completely vanish—no spark wouldpass, no shock would be felt—yet we would still have to deal with an electricphenomenon, but in the broad, modern interpretation of the word. In my firstpaper, before referred to, I have pointed out the curious properties of thebrush, and described the best manner of producing it, but I have thought itworth while to endeavor to express myself more clearly in regard to thisphenomenon, because of its absorbing interest.When a coil is operated with currents of very high frequency, beautiful brusheffects may be produced, even if the coil be of comparatively small dimensions.The experimenter may vary them in many ways, and, if it were for nothing else,they afford a pleasing sight. What adds to their interest is that they may beproduced with one single terminal as well as with two—in fact, often better withone than with two.But of all the discharge phenomena observed, the most pleasing to the eye, andthe most instructive, are those observed with a coil which is operated by meansof the disruptive discharge of a condenser. The power of the brushes, theabundance of the sparks, when the conditions are patiently adjusted, is oftenamazing. With even a very small coil, if it be so well insulated as to stand adifference of potential of several thousand volts per turn, the sparks may be soabundant that the whole coil may appear a complete mass of fire.Curiously enough the sparks, when the terminals of the coil are set at aconsiderable distance, seem to dart in every possible direction as though theterminals were perfectly independent of each other. As the sparks would soondestroy the insulation, it is necessary to prevent them. This is best done byimmersing the coil in a good liquid insulator, such as boiled-out oil. Immersionin a liquid may be considered almost an absolute necessity for the continued andsuccessful working of such a coil.It is, of course, out of the question, in an experimental lecture, with only afew minutes at disposal for the performance of each experiment, to show thesedischarge phenomena to advantage, as, to produce each phenomenon at its best, avery careful adjustment is required. But even if imperfectly produced, as theyare likely to be this evening, they are sufficiently striking to interest anintelligent audience.Before showing some of these curious effects I must, for the sake ofcompleteness, give a short description of the coil and other apparatus used inthe experiments with the disruptive discharge this evening.It is contained in a box B (Fig. 132) of thick boards of hard wood, covered onthe outside with a zinc sheet Z, which is carefully soldered all around. Itmight be advisable, in a strictly scientific investigation, when accuracy is ofgreat importance, to do away with the metal cover, as it might introduce manyerrors, principally on account of its complex action upon the coil, as acondenser of very small capacity and as an electrostatic and electromagneticscreen. When the coil is used for such experiments as are here contemplated, theemployment of the metal cover offers some practical advantages, but these arenot of sufficient importance to be dwelt upon.images [images/fig132.jpg]FIG. 132.The coil should be placed symmetrically to the metal cover, and the spacebetween should, of course, not be too small, certainly not less than, say, fivecentimeters, but much more if possible; especially the two sides of the zincbox, which are at right angles to the axis of the coil, should be sufficientlyremote from the latter, as otherwise they might impair its action and be asource of loss.The coil consists of two spools of hard rubber R R, held apart at a distance of10 centimeters by bolts C and nuts n, likewise of hard rubber. Each spoolcomprises a tube T of approximately 8 centimeters inside diameter, and 3millimeters thick, upon which are screwed two flanges F F, 24 centimeterssquare, the space between the flanges being about 3 centimeters. The secondary,S S, of the best gutta percha–covered wire, has 26 layers, 10 turns in each,giving for each half a total of 260 turns. The two halves are wound oppositelyand connected in series, the connection between both being made over theprimary. This disposition, besides being convenient, has the advantage that whenthe coil is well balanced—that is, when both of its terminals T1, T1, areconnected to bodies or devices of equal capacity—there is not much danger ofbreaking through to the primary, and the insulation between the primary and thesecondary need not be thick. In using the coil it is advisable to attach to bothterminals devices of nearly equal capacity, as, when the capacity of theterminals is not equal, sparks will be apt to pass to the primary. To avoidthis, the middle point of the secondary may be connected to the primary, butthis is not always practicable.The primary P P is wound in two parts, and oppositely, upon a wooden spool W,and the four ends are led out of the oil through hard rubber tubes t t. The endsof the secondary T1, T1 are also led out of the oil through rubber tubes t1, t1of great thickness. The primary and secondary layers are insulated by cottoncloth, the thickness of the insulation, of course, bearing some proportion tothe difference of potential between the turns of the different layers. Each halfof the primary has four layers, 24 turns in each, this giving a total of 96turns. When both the parts are connected in series, this gives a ratio ofconversion of about 1:2.7, and with the primaries in multiple, 1:5.4; but inoperating with very rapidly alternating currents this ratio does not convey evenan approximate idea of the ratio of the E. M. F’s. in the primary and secondarycircuits. The coil is held in position in the oil on wooden supports, therebeing about 5 centimeters thickness of oil all round. Where the oil is notspecially needed, the space is filled with pieces of wood, and for this purposeprincipally the wooden box B surrounding the whole is used.The construction here shown is, of course, not the best on general principles,but I believe it is a good and convenient one for the production of effects inwhich an excessive potential and a very small current are needed.In connection with the coil I use either the ordinary form of discharger or amodified form. In the former I have introduced two changes which secure someadvantages, and which are obvious. If they are mentioned, it is only in the hopethat some experimenter may find them of use.One of the changes is that the adjustable knobs A and B (Fig. 133), of thedischarger are held in jaws of brass, J J, by spring pressure, this allowing ofturning them successively into different positions, and so doing away with thetedious process of frequent polishing up.images [images/fig133.jpg]FIG. 133.The other change consists in the employment of a strong electromagnet N S, whichis placed with its axis at right angles to the line joining the knobs A and B,and produces a strong magnetic field between them. The pole pieces of the magnetare movable and properly formed so as to protrude between the brass knobs, inorder to make the field as intense as possible; but to prevent the dischargefrom jumping to the magnet the pole pieces are protected by a layer of mica, MM, of sufficient thickness; s1 s1 and s2 s2 are screws for fastening the wires.On each side one of the screws is for large and the other for small wires. L Lare screws for fixing in position the rods R R, which support the knobs.In another arrangement with the magnet I take the discharge between the roundedpole pieces themselves, which in such case are insulated and preferably providedwith polished brass caps.The employment of an intense magnetic field is of advantage principally when theinduction coil or transformer which charges the condenser is operated bycurrents of very low frequency. In such a case the number of the fundamentaldischarges between the knobs may be so small as to render the currents producedin the secondary unsuitable for many experiments. The intense magnetic fieldthen serves to blow out the arc between the knobs as soon as it is formed, andthe fundamental discharges occur in quicker succession.Instead of the magnet, a draught or blast of air may be employed with someadvantage. In this case the arc is preferably established between the knobs A B,in Fig. 131 (the knobs a b being generally joined, or entirely done away with),as in this disposition the arc is long and unsteady, and is easily affected bythe draught.When a magnet is employed to break the arc, it is better to choose theconnection indicated diagrammatically in Fig. 134, as in this case the currentsforming the arc are much more powerful, and the magnetic field exercises agreater influence. The use of the magnet permits, however, of the arc beingreplaced by a vacuum tube, but I have encountered great difficulties in workingwith an exhausted tube.images [images/fig134.jpg]FIG. 134.The other form of discharger used in these and similar experiments is indicatedin Figs. 135 and 136. It consists of a number of brass pieces c c (Fig. 135),each of which comprises a spherical middle portion m with an extension ebelow—which is merely used to fasten the piece in a lathe when polishing up thedischarging surface—and a column above, which consists of a knurled flange fsurmounted by a threaded stem l carrying a nut n, by means of which a wire isfastened to the column. The flange f conveniently serves for holding the brasspiece when fastening the wire, and also for turning it in any position when itbecomes necessary to present a fresh discharging surface. Two stout strips ofhard rubber R R, with planed grooves g g (Fig. 136) to fit the middle portion ofthe pieces c c, serve to clamp the latter and hold them firmly in position bymeans of two bolts C C (of which only one is shown) passing through the ends ofthe strips.images [images/fig135.jpg]FIG. 135.images [images/fig136.jpg]FIG. 136.In the use of this kind of discharger I have found three principal advantagesover the ordinary form. First, the dielectric strength of a given total width ofair space is greater when a great many small air gaps are used instead of one,which permits of working with a smaller length of air gap, and that meanssmaller loss and less deterioration of the metal; secondly, by reason ofsplitting the arc up into smaller arcs, the polished surfaces are made to lastmuch longer; and, thirdly, the apparatus affords some gauge in the experiments.I usually set the pieces by putting between them sheets of uniform thickness ata certain very small distance which is known from the experiments of Sir WilliamThomson to require a certain electromotive force to be bridged by the spark.It should, of course, be remembered that the sparking distance is muchdiminished as the frequency is increased. By taking any number of spaces theexperimenter has a rough idea of the electromotive force, and he finds it easierto repeat an experiment, as he has not the trouble of setting the knobs againand again. With this kind of discharger I have been able to maintain anoscillating motion without any spark being visible with the naked eye betweenthe knobs, and they would not show a very appreciable rise in temperature. Thisform of discharge also lends itself to many arrangements of condensers andcircuits which are often very convenient and timesaving. I have used itpreferably in a disposition similar to that indicated in Fig. 131, when thecurrents forming the arc are small.I may here mention that I have also used dischargers with single or multiple airgaps, in which the discharge surfaces were rotated with great speed. Noparticular advantage was, however, gained by this method, except in cases wherethe currents from the condenser were large and the keeping cool of the surfaceswas necessary, and in cases when, the discharge not being oscillating of itself,the arc as soon as established was broken by the air current, thus starting thevibration at intervals in rapid succession. I have also used mechanicalinterrupters in many ways. To avoid the difficulties with frictional contacts,the preferred plan adopted was to establish the arc and rotate through it atgreat speed a rim of mica provided with many holes and fastened to a steelplate. It is understood, of course, that the employment of a magnet, aircurrent, or other interrupter, produces no effect worth noticing, unless theself-induction, capacity and resistance are so related that there areoscillations set up upon each interruption.I will now endeavor to show you some of the most noteworthy of these dischargephenomena.I have stretched across the room two ordinary cotton covered wires, each aboutseven meters in length. They are supported on insulating cords at a distance ofabout thirty centimeters. I attach now to each of the terminals of the coil oneof the wires, and set the coil in action. Upon turning the lights off in theroom you see the wires strongly illuminated by the streams issuing abundantlyfrom their whole surface in spite of the cotton covering, which may even be verythick. When the experiment is performed under good conditions, the light fromthe wires is sufficiently intense to allow distinguishing the objects in a room.To produce the best result it is, of course, necessary to adjust carefully thecapacity of the jars, the arc between the knobs and the length of the wires. Myexperience is that calculation of the length of the wires leads, in such case,to no result whatever. The experimenter will do best to take the wires at thestart very long, and then adjust by cutting off first long pieces, and thensmaller and smaller ones as he approaches the right length.A convenient way is to use an oil condenser of very small capacity, consistingof two small adjustable metal plates, in connection with this and similarexperiments. In such case I take wires rather short and at the beginning set thecondenser plates at maximum distance. If the streams from the wires increase byapproach of the plates, the length of the wires is about right; if theydiminish, the wires are too long for that frequency and potential. When acondenser is used in connection with experiments with such a coil, it should bean oil condenser by all means, as in using an air condenser considerable energymight be wasted. The wires leading to the plates in the oil should be very thin,heavily coated with some insulating compound, and provided with a conductingcovering—this preferably extending under the surface of the oil. The conductingcover should not be too near the terminals, or ends, of the wire, as a sparkwould be apt to jump from the wire to it. The conducting coating is used todiminish the air losses, in virtue of its action as an electrostatic screen. Asto the size of the vessel containing the oil, and the size of the plates, theexperimenter gains at once an idea from a rough trial. The size of the plates inoil is, however, calculable, as the dielectric losses are very small.In the preceding experiment it is of considerable interest to know what relationthe quantity of the light emitted bears to the frequency and potential of theelectric impulses. My opinion is that the heat as well as light effects producedshould be proportionate, under otherwise equal conditions of test, to theproduct of frequency and square of potential, but the experimental verificationof the law, whatever it may be, would be exceedingly difficult. One thing iscertain, at any rate, and that is, that in augmenting the potential andfrequency we rapidly intensify the streams; and, though it may be very sanguine,it is surely not altogether hopeless to expect that we may succeed in producinga practical illuminant on these lines. We would then be simply using burners orflames, in which there would be no chemical process, no consumption of material,but merely a transfer of energy, and which would, in all probability, emit morelight and less heat than ordinary flames.The luminous intensity of the streams is, of course, considerably increased whenthey are focused upon a small surface. This may be shown by the followingexperiment:I attach to one of the terminals of the coil a wire w (Fig. 137), bent in acircle of about 30 centimeters in diameter, and to the other terminal I fasten asmall brass sphere s, the surface of the wire being preferably equal to thesurface of the sphere, and the center of the latter being in a line at rightangles to the plane of the wire circle and passing through its center. When thedischarge is established under proper conditions, a luminous hollow cone isformed, and in the dark one-half of the brass sphere is strongly illuminated, asshown in the cut.images [images/fig137.jpg]FIG. 137.By some artifice or other it is easy to concentrate the streams upon smallsurfaces and to produce very strong light effects. Two thin wires may thus berendered intensely luminous.In order to intensify the streams the wires should be very thin and short; butas in this case their capacity would be generally too small for the coil—atleast for such a one as the present—it is necessary to augment the capacity tothe required value, while, at the same time, the surface of the wires remainsvery small. This may be done in many ways.Here, for instance, I have two plates, R R, of hard rubber (Fig. 138), uponwhich I have glued two very thin wires w w, so as to form a name. The wires maybe bare or covered with the best insulation—it is immaterial for the success ofthe experiment. Well insulated wires, if anything, are preferable. On the backof each plate, indicated by the shaded portion, is a tinfoil coating t t. Theplates are placed in line at a sufficient distance to prevent a spark passingfrom one wire to the other. The two tinfoil coatings I have joined by aconductor C, and the two wires I presently connect to the terminals of the coil.It is now easy, by varying the strength and frequency of the currents throughthe primary, to find a point at which the capacity of the system is best suitedto the conditions, and the wires become so strongly luminous that, when thelight in the room is turned off the name formed by them appears in brilliantletters.images [images/fig138.jpg]FIG. 138.It is perhaps preferable to perform this experiment with a coil operated from analternator of high frequency, as then, owing to the harmonic rise and fall, thestreams are very uniform, though they are less abundant than when produced withsuch a coil as the present one. This experiment, however, may be performed withlow frequencies, but much less satisfactorily.When two wires, attached to the terminals of the coil, are set at the properdistance, the streams between them may be so intense as to produce a continuousluminous sheet. To show this phenomenon I have here two circles, C and c (Fig.139), of rather stout wire, one being about 80 centimeters and the other 30centimeters in diameter. To each of the terminals of the coil I attach one ofthe circles. The supporting wires are so bent that the circles may be placed inthe same plane, coinciding as nearly as possible. When the light in the room isturned off and the coil set to work, you see the whole space between the wiresuniformly filled with streams, forming a luminous disc, which could be seen froma considerable distance, such is the intensity of the streams. The outer circlecould have been much larger than the present one; in fact, with this coil I haveused much larger circles, and I have been able to produce a strongly luminoussheet, covering an area of more than one square meter, which is a remarkableeffect with this very small coil. To avoid uncertainty, the circle has beentaken smaller, and the area is now about 0.43 square meter.images [images/fig139.jpg]FIG. 139.The frequency of the vibration, and the quickness of succession of the sparksbetween the knobs, affect to a marked degree the appearance of the streams. Whenthe frequency is very low, the air gives way in more or less the same manner, asby a steady difference of potential, and the streams consist of distinctthreads, generally mingled with thin sparks, which probably correspond to thesuccessive discharges occurring between the knobs. But when the frequency isextremely high, and the arc of the discharge produces a very loud and smoothsound—showing both that oscillation takes place and that the sparks succeed eachother with great rapidity—then the luminous streams formed are perfectlyuniform. To reach this result very small coils and jars of small capacity shouldbe used. I take two tubes of thick Bohemian glass, about 5 centimeters indiameter and 20 centimeters long. In each of the tubes I slip a primary of verythick copper wire. On the top of each tube I wind a secondary of much thinnergutta-percha covered wire. The two secondaries I connect in series, theprimaries preferably in multiple arc. The tubes are then placed in a large glassvessel, at a distance of 10 to 15 centimeters from each other, on insulatingsupports, and the vessel is filled with boiled-out oil, the oil reaching aboutan inch above the tubes. The free ends of the secondary are lifted out of thecoil and placed parallel to each other at a distance of about ten centimeters.The ends which are scraped should be dipped in the oil. Two four-pint jarsjoined in series may be used to discharge through the primary. When thenecessary adjustments in the length and distance of the wires above the oil andin the arc of discharge are made, a luminous sheet is produced between the wireswhich is perfectly smooth and textureless, like the ordinary discharge through amoderately exhausted tube.I have purposely dwelt upon this apparently insignificant experiment. In trialsof this kind the experimenter arrives at the startling conclusion that, to passordinary luminous discharges through gases, no particular degree of exhaustionis needed, but that the gas may be at ordinary or even greater pressure. Toaccomplish this, a very high frequency is essential; a high potential islikewise required, but this is merely an incidental necessity. These experimentsteach us that, in endeavoring to discover novel methods of producing light bythe agitation of atoms, or molecules, of a gas, we need not limit our researchto the vacuum tube, but may look forward quite seriously to the possibility ofobtaining the light effects without the use of any vessel whatever, with air atordinary pressure.Such discharges of very high frequency, which render luminous the air atordinary pressures, we have probably occasion often to witness in Nature. I haveno doubt that if, as many believe, the aurora borealis is produced by suddencosmic disturbances, such as eruptions at the sun’s surface, which set theelectrostatic charge of the earth in an extremely rapid vibration, the red glowobserved is not confined to the upper rarefied strata of the air, but thedischarge traverses, by reason of its very high frequency, also the denseatmosphere in the form of a glow, such as we ordinarily produce in a slightlyexhausted tube. If the frequency were very low, or even more so, if the chargewere not at all vibrating, the dense air would break down as in a lightningdischarge. Indications of such breaking down of the lower dense strata of theair have been repeatedly observed at the occurrence of this marvelousphenomenon; but if it does occur, it can only be attributed to the fundamentaldisturbances, which are few in number, for the vibration produced by them wouldbe far too rapid to allow a disruptive break. It is the original and irregularimpulses which affect the instruments; the superimposed vibrations probably passunnoticed.When an ordinary low frequency discharge is passed through moderately rarefiedair, the air assumes a purplish hue. If by some means or other we increase theintensity of the molecular, or atomic, vibration, the gas changes to a whitecolor. A similar change occurs at ordinary pressures with electric impulses ofvery high frequency. If the molecules of the air around a wire are moderatelyagitated, the brush formed is reddish or violet; if the vibration is renderedsufficiently intense, the streams become white. We may accomplish this invarious ways. In the experiment before shown with the two wires across the room,I have endeavored to secure the result by pushing to a high value both thefrequency and potential; in the experiment with the thin wires glued on therubber plate I have concentrated the action upon a very small surface—in otherwords, I have worked with a great electric density.A most curious form of discharge is observed with such a coil when the frequencyand potential are pushed to the extreme limit. To perform the experiment, everypart of the coil should be heavily insulated, and only two small spheres—or,better still, two sharp-edged metal discs (d d, Fig. 140) of no more than a fewcentimeters in diameter—should be exposed to the air. The coil here used isimmersed in oil, and the ends of the secondary reaching out of the oil arecovered with an air-tight cover of hard rubber of great thickness. All cracks,if there are any, should be carefully stopped up, so that the brush dischargecannot form anywhere except on the small spheres or plates which are exposed tothe air. In this case, since there are no large plates or other bodies ofcapacity attached to the terminals, the coil is capable of an extremely rapidvibration. The potential may be raised by increasing, as far as the experimenterjudges proper, the rate of change of the primary current. With a coil not widelydiffering from the present, it is best to connect the two primaries in multiplearc; but if the secondary should have a much greater number of turns theprimaries should preferably be used in series, as otherwise the vibration mightbe too fast for the secondary. It occurs under these conditions that misty whitestreams break forth from the edges of the discs and spread out phantom-like intospace. With this coil, when fairly well produced, they are about 25 to 30centimeters long. When the hand is held against them no sensation is produced,and a spark, causing a shock, jumps from the terminal only upon the hand beingbrought much nearer. If the oscillation of the primary current is renderedintermittent by some means or other, there is a corresponding throbbing of thestreams, and now the hand or other conducting object may be brought in stillgreater proximity to the terminal without a spark being caused to jump.images [images/fig140.jpg]FIG. 140.Among the many beautiful phenomena which may be produced with such a coil, Ihave here selected only those which appear to possess some features of novelty,and lead us to some conclusions of interest. One will not find it at alldifficult to produce in the laboratory, by means of it, many other phenomenawhich appeal to the eye even more than these here shown, but present noparticular feature of novelty.Early experimenters describe the display of sparks produced by an ordinary largeinduction coil upon an insulating plate separating the terminals. Quite recentlySiemens performed some experiments in which fine effects were obtained, whichwere seen by many with interest. No doubt large coils, even if operated withcurrents of low frequencies, are capable of producing beautiful effects. But thelargest coil ever made could not, by far, equal the magnificent display ofstreams and sparks obtained from such a disruptive discharge coil when properlyadjusted. To give an idea, a coil such as the present one will cover easily aplate of one meter in diameter completely with the streams. The best way toperform such experiments is to take a very thin rubber or a glass plate and glueon one side of it a narrow ring of tinfoil of very large diameter, and on theother a circular washer, the center of the latter coinciding with that of thering, and the surfaces of both being preferably equal, so as to keep the coilwell balanced. The washer and ring should be connected to the terminals byheavily insulated thin wires. It is easy in observing the effect of the capacityto produce a sheet of uniform streams, or a fine network of thin silverythreads, or a mass of loud brilliant sparks, which completely cover the plate.Since I have advanced the idea of the conversion by means of the disruptivedischarge, in my paper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers atthe beginning of the past year, the interest excited in it has beenconsiderable. It affords us a means for producing any potentials by the aid ofinexpensive coils operated from ordinary systems of distribution, and—what isperhaps more appreciated—it enables us to convert currents of any frequency intocurrents of any other lower or higher frequency. But its chief value willperhaps be found in the help which it will afford us in the investigations ofthe phenomena of phosphorescence, which a disruptive discharge coil is capableof exciting in innumerable cases where ordinary coils, even the largest, wouldutterly fail.Considering its probable uses for many practical purposes, and its possibleintroduction into laboratories for scientific research, a few additional remarksas to the construction of such a coil will perhaps not be found superfluous.It is, of course, absolutely necessary to employ in such a coil wires providedwith the best insulation.Good coils may be produced by employing wires covered with several layers ofcotton, boiling the coil a long time in pure wax, and cooling under moderatepressure. The advantage of such a coil is that it can be easily handled, but itcannot probably give as satisfactory results as a coil immersed in pure oil.Besides, it seems that the presence of a large body of wax affects the coildisadvantageously, whereas this does not seem to be the case with oil. Perhapsit is because the dielectric losses in the liquid are smaller.I have tried at first silk and cotton covered wires with oil immersions, but Ihave been gradually led to use gutta-percha covered wires, which proved mostsatisfactory. Gutta-percha insulation adds, of course, to the capacity of thecoil, and this, especially if the coil be large, is a great disadvantage whenextreme frequencies are desired; but, on the other hand, gutta-percha willwithstand much more than an equal thickness of oil, and this advantage should besecured at any price. Once the coil has been immersed, it should never be takenout of the oil for more than a few hours, else the gutta-percha will crack upand the coil will not be worth half as much as before. Gutta-percha is probablyslowly attacked by the oil, but after an immersion of eight to nine months Ihave found no ill effects.I have obtained two kinds of gutta-percha wire known in commerce: in one theinsulation sticks tightly to the metal, in the other it does not. Unless aspecial method is followed to expel all air, it is much safer to use the firstkind. I wind the coil within an oil tank so that all interstices are filled upwith the oil. Between the layers I use cloth boiled out thoroughly in oil,calculating the thickness according to the difference of potential between theturns. There seems not to be a very great difference whatever kind of oil isused; I use paraffin or linseed oil.To exclude more perfectly the air, an excellent way to proceed, and easilypracticable with small coils, is the following: Construct a box of hardwood ofvery thick boards which have been for a long time boiled in oil. The boardsshould be so joined as to safely withstand the external air pressure. The coilbeing placed and fastened in position within the box, the latter is closed witha strong lid, and covered with closely fitting metal sheets, the joints of whichare soldered very carefully. On the top two small holes are drilled, passingthrough the metal sheet and the wood, and in these holes two small glass tubesare inserted and the joints made air-tight. One of the tubes is connected to avacuum pump, and the other with a vessel containing a sufficient quantity ofboiled-out oil. The latter tube has a very small hole at the bottom, and isprovided with a stopcock. When a fairly good vacuum has been obtained, thestopcock is opened and the oil slowly fed in. Proceeding in this manner, it isimpossible that any big bubbles, which are the principal danger, should remainbetween the turns. The air is most completely excluded, probably better than byboiling out, which, however, when gutta-percha coated wires are used, is notpracticable.For the primaries I use ordinary line wire with a thick cotton coating. Strandsof very thin insulated wires properly interlaced would, of course, be the bestto employ for the primaries, but they are not to be had.In an experimental coil the size of the wires is not of great importance. In thecoil here used the primary is No. 12 and the secondary No. 24 Brown & Sharpegauge wire; but the sections may be varied considerably. It would only implydifferent adjustments; the results aimed at would not be materially affected.I have dwelt at some length upon the various forms of brush discharge because,in studying them, we not only observe phenomena which please our eye, but alsoafford us food for thought, and lead us to conclusions of practical importance.In the use of alternating currents of very high tension, too much precautioncannot be taken to prevent the brush discharge. In a main conveying suchcurrents, in an induction coil or transformer, or in a condenser, the brushdischarge is a source of great danger to the insulation. In a condenser,especially, the gaseous matter must be most carefully expelled, for in it thecharged surfaces are near each other, and if the potentials are high, just assure as a weight will fall if let go, so the insulation will give way if asingle gaseous bubble of some size be present, whereas, if all gaseous matterwere carefully excluded, the condenser would safely withstand a much higherdifference of potential. A main conveying alternating currents of very hightension may be injured merely by a blowhole or small crack in the insulation,the more so as a blowhole is apt to contain gas at low pressure; and as itappears almost impossible to completely obviate such little imperfections, I amled to believe that in our future distribution of electrical energy by currentsof very high tension, liquid insulation will be used. The cost is a greatdrawback, but if we employ an oil as an insulator the distribution of electricalenergy with something like 100,000 volts, and even more, becomes, at least withhigher frequencies, so easy that it could be hardly called an engineering feat.With oil insulation and alternate current motors, transmissions of power can beaffected with safety and upon an industrial basis at distances of as much as athousand miles.A peculiar property of oils, and liquid insulation in general, when subjected torapidly changing electric stresses, is to disperse any gaseous bubbles which maybe present, and diffuse them through its mass, generally long before anyinjurious break can occur. This feature may be easily observed with an ordinaryinduction coil by taking the primary out, plugging up the end of the tube uponwhich the secondary is wound, and filling it with some fairly transparentinsulator, such as paraffin oil. A primary of a diameter something like sixmillimeters smaller than the inside of the tube may be inserted in the oil. Whenthe coil is set to work one may see, looking from the top through the oil, manyluminous points—air bubbles which are caught by inserting the primary, and whichare rendered luminous in consequence of the violent bombardment. The occludedair, by its impact against the oil, heats it; the oil begins to circulate,carrying some of the air along with it, until the bubbles are dispersed and theluminous points disappear. In this manner, unless large bubbles are occluded insuch way that circulation is rendered impossible, a damaging break is averted,the only effect being a moderate warming up of the oil. If, instead of theliquid, a solid insulation, no matter how thick, were used, a breaking throughand injury of the apparatus would be inevitable.The exclusion of gaseous matter from any apparatus in which the dielectric issubjected to more or less rapidly changing electric forces is, however, not onlydesirable in order to avoid a possible injury of the apparatus, but also onaccount of economy. In a condenser, for instance, as long as only a solid oronly a liquid dielectric is used, the loss is small; but if a gas under ordinaryor small pressure be present the loss may be very great. Whatever the nature ofthe force acting in the dielectric may be, it seems that in a solid or liquidthe molecular displacement produced by the force is small: hence the product offorce and displacement is insignificant, unless the force be very great; but ina gas the displacement, and therefore this product, is considerable; themolecules are free to move, they reach high speeds, and the energy of theirimpact is lost in heat or otherwise. If the gas be strongly compressed, thedisplacement due to the force is made smaller, and the losses are reduced.In most of the succeeding experiments I prefer, chiefly on account of theregular and positive action, to employ the alternator before referred to. Thisis one of the several machines constructed by me for the purpose of theseinvestigations. It has 384 pole projections, and is capable of giving currentsof a frequency of about 10,000 per second. This machine has been illustrated andbriefly described in my first paper before the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers, May 20th, 1891, to which I have already referred. A more detaileddescription, sufficient to enable any engineer to build a similar machine, willbe found in several electrical journals of that period.The induction coils operated from the machine are rather small, containing from5,000 to 15,000 turns in the secondary. They are immersed in boiled-out linseedoil, contained in wooden boxes covered with zinc sheet.I have found it advantageous to reverse the usual position of the wires, and towind, in these coils, the primaries on the top; thus allowing the use of a muchlarger primary, which, of course, reduces the danger of overheating andincreases the output of the coil. I make the primary on each side at least onecentimeter shorter than the secondary, to prevent the breaking through on theends, which would surely occur unless the insulation on the top of the secondarybe very thick, and this, of course, would be disadvantageous.When the primary is made movable, which is necessary in some experiments, andmany times convenient for the purposes of adjustment, I cover the secondary withwax, and turn it off in a lathe to a diameter slightly smaller than the insideof the primary coil. The latter I provide with a handle reaching out of the oil,which serves to shift it in any position along the secondary.I will now venture to make, in regard to the general manipulation of inductioncoils, a few observations bearing upon points which have not been fullyappreciated in earlier experiments with such coils, and are even now oftenoverlooked.The secondary of the coil possesses usually such a high self-induction that thecurrent through the wire is inappreciable, and may be so even when the terminalsare joined by a conductor of small resistance. If capacity is added to theterminals, the self-induction is counteracted, and a stronger current is made toflow through the secondary, though its terminals are insulated from each other.To one entirely unacquainted with the properties of alternating currents nothingwill look more puzzling. This feature was illustrated in the experimentperformed at the beginning with the top plates of wire gauze attached to theterminals and the rubber plate. When the plates of wire gauze were closetogether, and a small arc passed between them, the arc prevented a strongcurrent from passing through the secondary, because it did away with thecapacity on the terminals; when the rubber plate was inserted between, thecapacity of the condenser formed counteracted the self-induction of thesecondary, a stronger current passed now, the coil performed more work, and thedischarge was by far more powerful.The first thing, then, in operating the induction coil is to combine capacitywith the secondary to overcome the self-induction. If the frequencies andpotentials are very high, gaseous matter should be carefully kept away from thecharged surfaces. If Leyden jars are used, they should be immersed in oil, asotherwise considerable dissipation may occur if the jars are greatly strained.When high frequencies are used, it is of equal importance to combine a condenserwith the primary. One may use a condenser connected to the ends of the primaryor to the terminals of the alternator, but the latter is not to be recommended,as the machine might be injured. The best way is undoubtedly to use thecondenser in series with the primary and with the alternator, and to adjust itscapacity so as to annul the self-induction of both the latter. The condensershould be adjustable by very small steps, and for a finer adjustment a small oilcondenser with movable plates may be used conveniently.I think it best at this juncture to bring before you a phenomenon, observed byme some time ago, which to the purely scientific investigator may perhaps appearmore interesting than any of the results which I have the privilege to presentto you this evening.It may be quite properly ranked among the brush phenomena—in fact, it is abrush, formed at, or near, a single terminal in high vacuum.In bulbs provided with a conducting terminal, though it be of aluminum, thebrush has but an ephemeral existence, and cannot, unfortunately, be indefinitelypreserved in its most sensitive state, even in a bulb devoid of any conductingelectrode. In studying the phenomenon, by all means a bulb having no leading-inwire should be used. I have found it best to use bulbs constructed as indicatedin Figs. 141 and 142.images [images/fig141.jpg]FIG. 141.images [images/fig142.jpg]FIG. 142.In Fig. 141 the bulb comprises an incandescent lamp globe L, in the neck ofwhich is sealed a barometer tube b, the end of which is blown out to form asmall sphere s. This sphere should be sealed as closely as possible in thecenter of the large globe. Before sealing, a thin tube t, of aluminum sheet, maybe slipped in the barometer tube, but it is not important to employ it.The small hollow sphere s is filled with some conducting powder, and a wire w iscemented in the neck for the purpose of connecting the conducting powder withthe generator.The construction shown in Fig. 142 was chosen in order to remove from the brushany conducting body which might possibly affect it. The bulb consists in thiscase of a lamp globe L, which has a neck n, provided with a tube b and smallsphere s, sealed to it, so that two entirely independent compartments areformed, as indicated in the drawing. When the bulb is in use the neck n isprovided with a tinfoil coating, which is connected to the generator and actsinductively upon the moderately rarefied and highly conducted gas inclosed inthe neck. From there the current passes through the tube b into the small spheres, to act by induction upon the gas contained in the globe L.It is of advantage to make the tube t very thick, the hole through it verysmall, and to blow the sphere s very thin. It is of the greatest importance thatthe sphere s be placed in the center of the globe L.Figs. 143, 144 and 145 indicate different forms, or stages, of the brush. Fig.143 shows the brush as it first appears in a bulb provided with a conductingterminal; but, as in such a bulb it very soon disappears—often after a fewminutes—I will confine myself to the description of the phenomenon as seen in abulb without conducting electrode. It is observed under the followingconditions:images [images/fig143.jpg]FIG. 143.images [images/fig144.jpg]FIG. 144.images [images/fig145.jpg]FIG. 145.When the globe L (Figs. 141 and 142) is exhausted to a very high degree,generally the bulb is not excited upon connecting the wire w (Fig. 141) or thetinfoil coating of the bulb (Fig. 142) to the terminal of the induction coil. Toexcite it, it is usually sufficient to grasp the globe L with the hand. Anintense phosphorescence then spreads at first over the globe, but soon givesplace to a white, misty light. Shortly afterward one may notice that theluminosity is unevenly distributed in the globe, and after passing the currentfor some time the bulb appears as in Fig. 144. From this stage the phenomenonwill gradually pass to that indicated in Fig. 145, after some minutes, hours,days or weeks, according as the bulb is worked. Warming the bulb or increasingthe potential hastens the transit.When the brush assumes the form indicated in Fig. 145, it may be brought to astate of extreme sensitiveness to electrostatic and magnetic influence. The bulbhanging straight down from a wire, and all objects being remote from it, theapproach of the observer at a few paces from the bulb will cause the brush tofly to the opposite side, and if he walks around the bulb it will always keep onthe opposite side. It may begin to spin around the terminal long before itreaches that sensitive stage. When it begins to turn around, principally, butalso before, it is affected by a magnet, and at a certain stage it issusceptible to magnetic influence to an astonishing degree. A small permanentmagnet, with its poles at a distance of no more than two centimeters, willaffect it visibly at a distance of two meters, slowing down or accelerating therotation according to how it is held relatively to the brush. I think I haveobserved that at the stage when it is most sensitive to magnetic, it is not mostsensitive to electrostatic, influence. My explanation is, that the electrostaticattraction between the brush and the glass of the bulb, which retards therotation, grows much quicker than the magnetic influence when the intensity ofthe stream is increased.When the bulb hangs with the globe L down, the rotation is always clockwise. Inthe southern hemisphere it would occur in the opposite direction and on theequator the brush should not turn at all. The rotation may be reversed by amagnet kept at some distance. The brush rotates best, seemingly, when it is atright angles to the lines of force of the earth. It very likely rotates, when atits maximum speed, in synchronism with the alternations, say, 10,000 times asecond. The rotation can be slowed down or accelerated by the approach orreceding of the observer, or any conducting body, but it cannot be reversed byputting the bulb in any position. When it is in the state of the highestsensitiveness and the potential or frequency be varied, the sensitiveness israpidly diminished. Changing either of these but little will generally stop therotation. The sensitiveness is likewise affected by the variations oftemperature. To attain great sensitiveness it is necessary to have the smallsphere s in the center of the globe L, as otherwise the electrostatic action ofthe glass of the globe will tend to stop the rotation. The sphere s should besmall and of uniform thickness; any dissymmetry of course has the effect todiminish the sensitiveness.The fact that the brush rotates in a definite direction in a permanent magneticfield seems to show that in alternating currents of very high frequency thepositive and negative impulses are not equal, but that one always preponderatesover the other.Of course, this rotation in one direction may be due to the action of the twoelements of the same current upon each other, or to the action of the fieldproduced by one of the elements upon the other, as in a series motor, withoutnecessarily one impulse being stronger than the other. The fact that the brushturns, as far as I could observe, in any position, would speak for this view. Insuch case it would turn at any point of the earth’s surface. But, on the otherhand, it is then hard to explain why a permanent magnet should reverse therotation, and one must assume the preponderance of impulses of one kind.As to the causes of the formation of the brush or stream, I think it is due tothe electrostatic action of the globe and the dissymmetry of the parts. If thesmall bulb s and the globe L were perfect concentric spheres, and the glassthroughout of the same thickness and quality, I think the brush would not form,as the tendency to pass would be equal on all sides. That the formation of thestream is due to an irregularity is apparent from the fact that it has thetendency to remain in one position, and rotation occurs most generally only whenit is brought out of this position by electrostatic or magnetic influence. Whenin an extremely sensitive state it rests in one position, most curiousexperiments may be performed with it. For instance, the experimenter may, byselecting a proper position, approach the hand at a certain considerabledistance to the bulb, and he may cause the brush to pass off by merelystiffening the muscles of the arm. When it begins to rotate slowly, and thehands are held at a proper distance, it is impossible to make even the slightestmotion without producing a visible effect upon the brush. A metal plateconnected to the other terminal of the coil affects it at a great distance,slowing down the rotation often to one turn a second.I am firmly convinced that such a brush, when we learn how to produce itproperly, will prove a valuable aid in the investigation of the nature of theforces acting in an electrostatic or magnetic field. If there is any motionwhich is measurable going on in the space, such a brush ought to reveal it. Itis, so to speak, a beam of light, frictionless, devoid of inertia.I think that it may find practical applications in telegraphy. With such a brushit would be possible to send dispatches across the Atlantic, for instance, withany speed, since its sensitiveness may be so great that the slightest changeswill affect it. If it were possible to make the stream more intense and verynarrow, its deflections could be easily photographed.I have been interested to find whether there is a rotation of the stream itself,or whether there is simply a stress traveling around the bulb. For this purposeI mounted a light mica fan so that its vanes were in the path of the brush. Ifthe stream itself was rotating the fan would be spun around. I could produce nodistinct rotation of the fan, although I tried the experiment repeatedly; but asthe fan exerted a noticeable influence on the stream, and the apparent rotationof the latter was, in this case, never quite satisfactory, the experiment didnot appear to be conclusive.I have been unable to produce the phenomenon with the disruptive discharge coil,although every other of these phenomena can be well produced by it—many, infact, much better than with coils operated from an alternator.It may be possible to produce the brush by impulses of one direction, or even bya steady potential, in which case it would be still more sensitive to magneticinfluence.In operating an induction coil with rapidly alternating currents, we realizewith astonishment, for the first time, the great importance of the relation ofcapacity, self-induction and frequency as regards the general results. Theeffects of capacity are the most striking, for in these experiments, since theself-induction and frequency both are high, the critical capacity is very small,and need be but slightly varied to produce a very considerable change. Theexperimenter may bring his body in contact with the terminals of the secondaryof the coil, or attach to one or both terminals insulated bodies of very smallbulk, such as bulbs, and he may produce a considerable rise or fall ofpotential, and greatly affect the flow of the current through the primary. Inthe experiment before shown, in which a brush appears at a wire attached to oneterminal, and the wire is vibrated when the experimenter brings his insulatedbody in contact with the other terminal of the coil, the sudden rise ofpotential was made evident.I may show you the behavior of the coil in another manner which possesses afeature of some interest. I have here a little light fan of aluminum sheet,fastened to a needle and arranged to rotate freely in a metal piece screwed toone of the terminals of the coil. When the coil is set to work, the molecules ofthe air are rhythmically attracted and repelled. As the force with which theyare repelled is greater than that with which they are attracted, it results thatthere is a repulsion exerted on the surfaces of the fan. If the fan were madesimply of a metal sheet, the repulsion would be equal on the opposite sides, andwould produce no effect. But if one of the opposing surfaces is screened, or if,generally speaking, the bombardment on this side is weakened in some way orother, there remains the repulsion exerted upon the other, and the fan is set inrotation. The screening is best effected by fastening upon one of the opposingsides of the fan insulated conducting coatings, or, if the fan is made in theshape of an ordinary propeller screw, by fastening on one side, and close to it,an insulated metal plate. The static screen may, however, be omitted, and simplya thickness of insulating material fastened to one of the sides of the fan.To show the behavior of the coil, the fan may be placed upon the terminal and itwill readily rotate when the coil is operated by currents of very highfrequency. With a steady potential, of course, and even with alternatingcurrents of very low frequency, it would not turn, because of the very slowexchange of air and, consequently, smaller bombardment; but in the latter caseit might turn if the potential were excessive. With a pin wheel, quite theopposite rule holds good; it rotates best with a steady potential, and theeffort is the smaller the higher the frequency. Now, it is very easy to adjustthe conditions so that the potential is normally not sufficient to turn the fan,but that by connecting the other terminal of the coil with an insulated body itrises to a much greater value, so as to rotate the fan, and it is likewisepossible to stop the rotation by connecting to the terminal a body of differentsize, thereby diminishing the potential.Instead of using the fan in this experiment, we may use the “electric”radiometer with similar effect. But in this case it will be found that the vaneswill rotate only at high exhaustion or at ordinary pressures; they will notrotate at moderate pressures, when the air is highly conducting. This curiousobservation was made conjointly by Professor Crookes and myself. I attribute theresult to the high conductivity of the air, the molecules of which then do notact as independent carriers of electric charges, but act all together as asingle conducting body. In such case, of course, if there is any repulsion atall of the molecules from the vanes, it must be very small. It is possible,however, that the result is in part due to the fact that the greater part of thedischarge passes from the leading-in wire through the highly conducting gas,instead of passing off from the conducting vanes.In trying the preceding experiment with the electric radiometer the potentialshould not exceed a certain limit, as then the electrostatic attraction betweenthe vanes and the glass of the bulb may be so great as to stop the rotation.A most curious feature of alternate currents of high frequencies and potentialsis that they enable us to perform many experiments by the use of one wire only.In many respects this feature is of great interest.In a type of alternate current motor invented by me some years ago I producedrotation by inducing, by means of a single alternating current passed through amotor circuit, in the mass or other circuits of the motor, secondary currents,which, jointly with the primary or inducing current, created a moving field offorce. A simple but crude form of such a motor is obtained by winding upon aniron core a primary, and close to it a secondary coil, joining the ends of thelatter and placing a freely movable metal disc within the influence of the fieldproduced by both. The iron core is employed for obvious reasons, but it is notessential to the operation. To improve the motor, the iron core is made toencircle the armature. Again to improve, the secondary coil is made to partlyoverlap the primary, so that it cannot free itself from a strong inductiveaction of the latter, repel its lines as it may. Once more to improve, theproper difference of phase is obtained between the primary and secondarycurrents by a condenser, self-induction, resistance or equivalent windings.I had discovered, however, that rotation is produced by means of a single coiland core; my explanation of the phenomenon, and leading thought in trying theexperiment, being that there must be a true time lag in the magnetization of thecore. I remember the pleasure I had when, in the writings of Professor Ayrton,which came later to my hand, I found the idea of the time lag advocated. Whetherthere is a true time lag, or whether the retardation is due to eddy currentscirculating in minute paths, must remain an open question, but the fact is thata coil wound upon an iron core and traversed by an alternating current creates amoving field of force, capable of setting an armature in rotation. It is of someinterest, in conjunction with the historical Arago experiment, to mention thatin lag or phase motors I have produced rotation in the opposite direction to themoving field, which means that in that experiment the magnet may not rotate, ormay even rotate in the opposite direction to the moving disc. Here, then, is amotor (diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 146), comprising a coil and ironcore, and a freely movable copper disc in proximity to the latter.images [images/fig146.jpg]FIG. 146.To demonstrate a novel and interesting feature, I have, for a reason which Iwill explain, selected this type of motor. When the ends of the coil areconnected to the terminals of an alternator the disc is set in rotation. But itis not this experiment, now well known, which I desire to perform. What I wishto show you is that this motor rotates with one single connection between it andthe generator; that is to say, one terminal of the motor is connected to oneterminal of the generator—in this case the secondary of a high-tension inductioncoil—the other terminals of motor and generator being insulated in space. Toproduce rotation it is generally (but not absolutely) necessary to connect thefree end of the motor coil to an insulated body of some size. The experimenter’sbody is more than sufficient. If he touches the free terminal with an objectheld in the hand, a current passes through the coil and the copper disc is setin rotation. If an exhausted tube is put in series with the coil, the tubelights brilliantly, showing the passage of a strong current. Instead of theexperimenter’s body, a small metal sheet suspended on a cord may be used withthe same result. In this case the plate acts as a condenser in series with thecoil. It counteracts the self-induction of the latter and allows a strongcurrent to pass. In such a combination, the greater the self-induction of thecoil the smaller need be the plate, and this means that a lower frequency, oreventually a lower potential, is required to operate the motor. A single coilwound upon a core has a high self-induction; for this reason, principally, thistype of motor was chosen to perform the experiment. Were a secondary closed coilwound upon the core, it would tend to diminish the self-induction, and then itwould be necessary to employ a much higher frequency and potential. Neitherwould be advisable, for a higher potential would endanger the insulation of thesmall primary coil, and a higher frequency would result in a materiallydiminished torque.It should be remarked that when such a motor with a closed secondary is used, itis not at all easy to obtain rotation with excessive frequencies, as thesecondary cuts off almost completely the lines of the primary—and this, ofcourse, the more, the higher the frequency—and allows the passage of but aminute current. In such a case, unless the secondary is closed through acondenser, it is almost essential, in order to produce rotation, to make theprimary and secondary coils overlap each other more or less.But there is an additional feature of interest about this motor, namely, it isnot necessary to have even a single connection between the motor and generator,except, perhaps, through the ground; for not only is an insulated plate capableof giving off energy into space, but it is likewise capable of deriving it froman alternating electrostatic field, though in the latter case the availableenergy is much smaller. In this instance one of the motor terminals is connectedto the insulated plate or body located within the alternating electrostaticfield, and the other terminal preferably to the ground.It is quite possible, however, that such “no wire” motors, as they might becalled, could be operated by conduction through the rarefied air at considerabledistances. Alternate currents, especially of high frequencies, pass withastonishing freedom through even slightly rarefied gases. The upper strata ofthe air are rarefied. To reach a number of miles out into space requires theovercoming of difficulties of a merely mechanical nature. There is no doubt thatwith the enormous potentials obtainable by the use of high frequencies and oilinsulation, luminous discharges might be passed through many miles of rarefiedair, and that, by thus directing the energy of many hundreds or thousands ofhorse-power, motors or lamps might be operated at considerable distances fromstationary sources. But such schemes are mentioned merely as possibilities. Weshall have no need to transmit power in this way. We shall have no need totransmit power at all. Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be drivenby a power obtainable at any point of the universe. This idea is not novel. Menhave been led to it long ago by instinct or reason. It has been expressed inmany ways, and in many places, in the history of old and new. We find it in thedelightful myth of Antheus, who derives power from the earth; we find it amongthe subtle speculations of one of your splendid mathematicians, and in manyhints and statements of thinkers of the present time. Throughout space there isenergy. Is this energy static or kinetic? If static our hopes are in vain; ifkinetic—and this we know it is, for certain—then it is a mere question of timewhen men will succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork ofnature. Of all, living or dead, Crookes came nearest to doing it. His radiometerwill turn in the light of day and in the darkness of the night; it will turneverywhere where there is heat, and heat is everywhere. But, unfortunately, thisbeautiful little machine, while it goes down to posterity as the mostinteresting, must likewise be put on record as the most inefficient machine everinvented!The preceding experiment is only one of many equally interesting experimentswhich may be performed by the use of only one wire with alternations of highpotential and frequency. We may connect an insulated line to a source of suchcurrents, we may pass an inappreciable current over the line, and on any pointof the same we are able to obtain a heavy current, capable of fusing a thickcopper wire. Or we may, by the help of some artifice, decompose a solution inany electrolytic cell by connecting only one pole of the cell to the line orsource of energy. Or we may, by attaching to the line, or only bringing into itsvicinity, light up an incandescent lamp, an exhausted tube, or a phosphorescentbulb.However impracticable this plan of working may appear in many cases, itcertainly seems practicable, and even recommendable, in the production of light.A perfected lamp would require but little energy, and if wires were used at allwe ought to be able to supply that energy without a return wire.It is now a fact that a body may be rendered incandescent or phosphorescent bybringing it either in single contact or merely in the vicinity of a source ofelectric impulses of the proper character, and that in this manner a quantity oflight sufficient to afford a practical illuminant may be produced. It is,therefore, to say the least, worth while to attempt to determine the bestconditions and to invent the best appliances for attaining this object.Some experiences have already been gained in this direction, and I will dwell onthem briefly, in the hope that they might prove useful.The heating of a conducting body inclosed in a bulb, and connected to a sourceof rapidly alternating electric impulses, is dependent on so many things of adifferent nature, that it would be difficult to give a generally applicable ruleunder which the maximum heating occurs. As regards the size of the vessel, Ihave lately found that at ordinary or only slightly differing atmosphericpressures, when air is a good insulator, and hence practically the same amountof energy by a certain potential and frequency is given off from the body,whether the bulb be small or large, the body is brought to a higher temperatureif enclosed in a small bulb, because of the better confinement of heat in thiscase.At lower pressures, when air becomes more or less conducting, or if the air besufficiently warmed to become conducting, the body is rendered more intenselyincandescent in a large bulb, obviously because, under otherwise equalconditions of test, more energy may be given off from the body when the bulb islarge.At very high degrees of exhaustion, when the matter in the bulb becomes“radiant,” a large bulb has still an advantage, but a comparatively slight one,over the small bulb.Finally, at excessively high degrees of exhaustion, which cannot be reachedexcept by the employment of special means, there seems to be, beyond a certainand rather small size of vessel, no perceptible difference in the heating.These observations were the result of a number of experiments, of which one,showing the effect of the size of the bulb at a high degree of exhaustion, maybe described and shown here, as it presents a feature of interest. Threespherical bulbs of 2 inches, 3 inches and 4 inches diameter were taken, and inthe center of each was mounted an equal length of an ordinary incandescent lampfilament of uniform thickness. In each bulb the piece of filament was fastenedto the leading-in wire of platinum, contained in a glass stem sealed in thebulb; care being taken, of course, to make everything as nearly alike aspossible. On each glass stem in the inside of the bulb was slipped a highlypolished tube made of aluminum sheet, which fitted the stem and was held on itby spring pressure. The function of this aluminum tube will be explainedsubsequently. In each bulb an equal length of filament protruded above the metaltube. It is sufficient to say now that under these conditions equal lengths offilament of the same thickness—in other words, bodies of equal bulk—were broughtto incandescence. The three bulbs were sealed to a glass tube, which wasconnected to a Sprengel pump. When a high vacuum had been reached, the glasstube carrying the bulbs was sealed off. A current was then turned onsuccessively on each bulb, and it was found that the filaments came to about thesame brightness, and, if anything, the smallest bulb, which was placed midwaybetween the two larger ones, may have been slightly brighter. This result wasexpected, for when either of the bulbs was connected to the coil the luminosityspread through the other two, hence the three bulbs constituted really onevessel. When all the three bulbs were connected in multiple arc to the coil, inthe largest of them the filament glowed brightest, in the next smaller it was alittle less bright, and in the smallest it only came to redness. The bulbs werethen sealed off and separately tried. The brightness of the filaments was nowsuch as would have been expected on the supposition that the energy given offwas proportionate to the surface of the bulb, this surface in each caserepresenting one of the coatings of a condenser. Accordingly, there was lessdifference between the largest and the middle sized than between the latter andthe smallest bulb.An interesting observation was made in this experiment. The three bulbs weresuspended from a straight bare wire connected to a terminal of a coil, thelargest bulb being placed at the end of the wire, at some distance from it thesmallest bulb, and at an equal distance from the latter the middle-sized one.The carbons glowed then in both the larger bulbs about as expected, but thesmallest did not get its share by far. This observation led me to exchange theposition of the bulbs, and I then observed that whichever of the bulbs was inthe middle was by far less bright than it was in any other position. Thismystifying result was, of course, found to be due to the electrostatic actionbetween the bulbs. When they were placed at a considerable distance, or whenthey were attached to the corners of an equilateral triangle of copper wire,they glowed in about the order determined by their surfaces.As to the shape of the vessel, it is also of some importance, especially at highdegrees of exhaustion. Of all the possible constructions, it seems that aspherical globe with the refractory body mounted in its center is the best toemploy. By experience it has been demonstrated that in such a globe a refractorybody of a given bulk is more easily brought to incandescence than whendifferently shaped bulbs are used. There is also an advantage in giving to theincandescent body the shape of a sphere, for self-evident reasons. In any casethe body should be mounted in the center, where the atoms rebounding from theglass collide. This object is best attained in the spherical bulb; but it isalso attained in a cylindrical vessel with one or two straight filamentscoinciding with its axis, and possibly also in parabolical or spherical bulbswith refractory body or bodies placed in the focus or foci of the same; thoughthe latter is not probable, as the electrified atoms should in all cases reboundnormally from the surface they strike, unless the speed were excessive, in whichcase they would probably follow the general law of reflection. No matter whatshape the vessel may have, if the exhaustion be low, a filament mounted in theglobe is brought to the same degree of incandescence in all parts; but if theexhaustion be high and the bulb be spherical or pear-shaped, as usual, focalpoints form and the filament is heated to a higher degree at or near suchpoints.To illustrate the effect, I have here two small bulbs which are alike, only oneis exhausted to a low and the other to a very high degree. When connected to thecoil, the filament in the former glows uniformly throughout all its length;whereas in the latter, that portion of the filament which is in the center ofthe bulb glows far more intensely than the rest. A curious point is that thephenomenon occurs even if two filaments are mounted in a bulb, each beingconnected to one terminal of the coil, and, what is still more curious, if theybe very near together, provided the vacuum be very high. I noted in experimentswith such bulbs that the filaments would give way usually at a certain point,and in the first trials I attributed it to a defect in the carbon. But when thephenomenon occurred many times in succession I recognized its real cause.In order to bring a refractory body inclosed in a bulb to incandescence, it isdesirable, on account of economy, that all the energy supplied to the bulb fromthe source should reach without loss the body to be heated; from there, and fromnowhere else, it should be radiated. It is, of course, out of the question toreach this theoretical result, but it is possible by a proper construction ofthe illuminating device to approximate it more or less.For many reasons, the refractory body is placed in the center of the bulb, andit is usually supported on a glass stem containing the leading-in wire. As thepotential of this wire is alternated, the rarefied gas surrounding the stem isacted upon inductively, and the glass stem is violently bombarded and heated. Inthis manner by far the greater portion of the energy supplied to thebulb—especially when exceedingly high frequencies are used—may be lost for thepurpose contemplated. To obviate this loss, or at least to reduce it to aminimum, I usually screen the rarefied gas surrounding the stem from theinductive action of the leading-in wire by providing the stem with a tube orcoating of conducting material. It seems beyond doubt that the best among metalsto employ for this purpose is aluminum, on account of its many remarkableproperties. Its only fault is that it is easily fusible, and, therefore, itsdistance from the incandescing body should be properly estimated. Usually, athin tube, of a diameter somewhat smaller than that of the glass stem, is madeof the finest aluminum sheet, and slipped on the stem. The tube is convenientlyprepared by wrapping around a rod fastened in a lathe a piece of aluminum sheetof proper size, grasping the sheet firmly with clean chamois leather or blottingpaper, and spinning the rod very fast. The sheet is wound tightly around therod, and a highly polished tube of one or three layers of the sheet is obtained.When slipped on the stem, the pressure is generally sufficient to prevent itfrom slipping off, but, for safety, the lower edge of the sheet may be turnedinside. The upper inside corner of the sheet—that is, the one which is nearestto the refractory incandescent body—should be cut out diagonally, as it oftenhappens that, in consequence of the intense heat, this corner turns toward theinside and comes very near to, or in contact with, the wire, or filament,supporting the refractory body. The greater part of the energy supplied to thebulb is then used up in heating the metal tube, and the bulb is rendered uselessfor the purpose. The aluminum sheet should project above the glass stem more orless—one inch or so—or else, if the glass be too close to the incandescing body,it may be strongly heated and become more or less conducting, whereupon it maybe ruptured, or may, by its conductivity, establish a good electrical connectionbetween the metal tube and the leading-in wire, in which case, again, most ofthe energy will be lost in heating the former. Perhaps the best way is to makethe top of the glass tube, for about an inch, of a much smaller diameter. Tostill further reduce the danger arising from the heating of the glass stem, andalso with the view of preventing an electrical connection between the metal tubeand the electrode, I preferably wrap the stem with several layers of thin mica,which extends at least as far as the metal tube. In some bulbs I have also usedan outside insulating cover.The preceding remarks are only made to aid the experimenter in the first trials,for the difficulties which he encounters he may soon find means to overcome inhis own way.To illustrate the effect of the screen, and the advantage of using it, I havehere two bulbs of the same size, with their stems, leading-in wires andincandescent lamp filaments tied to the latter, as nearly alike as possible. Thestem of one bulb is provided with an aluminum tube, the stem of the other hasnone. Originally the two bulbs were joined by a tube which was connected to aSprengel pump. When a high vacuum had been reached, first the connecting tube,and then the bulbs, were sealed off; they are therefore of the same degree ofexhaustion. When they are separately connected to the coil giving a certainpotential, the carbon filament in the bulb provided with the aluminum screen isrendered highly incandescent, while the filament in the other bulb may, with thesame potential, not even come to redness, although in reality the latter bulbtakes generally more energy than the former. When they are both connectedtogether to the terminal, the difference is even more apparent, showing theimportance of the screening. The metal tube placed on the stem containing theleading-in wire performs really two distinct functions: First, it acts more orless as an electrostatic screen, thus economizing the energy supplied to thebulb; and, second, to whatever extent it may fail to act electrostatically, itacts mechanically, preventing the bombardment, and consequently intense heatingand possible deterioration of the slender support of the refractory incandescentbody, or of the glass stem containing the leading-in wire. I say slendersupport, for it is evident that in order to confine the heat more completely tothe incandescing body its support should be very thin, so as to carry away thesmallest possible amount of heat by conduction. Of all the supports used I havefound an ordinary incandescent lamp filament to be the best, principally becauseamong conductors it can withstand the highest degree of heat.The effectiveness of the metal tube as an electrostatic screen depends largelyon the degree of exhaustion.At excessively high degrees of exhaustion—which are reached by using great careand special means in connection with the Sprengel pump—when the matter in theglobe is in the ultra-radiant state, it acts most perfectly. The shadow of theupper edge of the tube is then sharply defined upon the bulb.At a somewhat lower degree of exhaustion, which is about the ordinary“non-striking” vacuum, and generally as long as the matter moves predominantlyin straight lines, the screen still does well. In elucidation of the precedingremark it is necessary to state that what is a “non-striking” vacuum for a coiloperated as ordinarily, by impulses, or currents, of low frequency, is not so,by far, when the coil is operated by currents of very high frequency. In suchcase the discharge may pass with great freedom through the rarefied gas throughwhich a low frequency discharge may not pass, even though the potential be muchhigher. At ordinary atmospheric pressures just the reverse rule holds good: thehigher the frequency, the less the spark discharge is able to jump between theterminals, especially if they are knobs or spheres of some size.Finally, at very low degrees of exhaustion, when the gas is well conducting, themetal tube not only does not act as an electrostatic screen, but even is adrawback, aiding to a considerable extent the dissipation of the energylaterally from the leading-in wire. This, of course, is to be expected. In thiscase, namely, the metal tube is in good electrical connection with theleading-in wire, and most of the bombardment is directed upon the tube. As longas the electrical connection is not good, the conducting tube is always of someadvantage, for although it may not greatly economize energy, still it protectsthe support of the refractory button, and is the means of concentrating moreenergy upon the same.To whatever extent the aluminum tube performs the function of a screen, itsusefulness is therefore limited to very high degrees of exhaustion when it isinsulated from the electrode—that is, when the gas as a whole is non-conducting,and the molecules, or atoms, act as independent carriers of electric charges.In addition to acting as a more or less effective screen, in the true meaning ofthe word, the conducting tube or coating may also act, by reason of itsconductivity, as a sort of equalizer or dampener of the bombardment against thestem. To be explicit, I assume the action to be as follows: Suppose a rhythmicalbombardment to occur against the conducting tube by reason of its imperfectaction as a screen, it certainly must happen that some molecules, or atoms,strike the tube sooner than others. Those which come first in contact with itgive up their superfluous charge, and the tube is electrified, theelectrification instantly spreading over its surface. But this must diminish theenergy lost in the bombardment, for two reasons: first, the charge given up bythe atoms spreads over a great area, and hence the electric density at any pointis small, and the atoms are repelled with less energy than they would be if theystruck against a good insulator; secondly, as the tube is electrified by theatoms which first come in contact with it, the progress of the following atomsagainst the tube is more or less checked by the repulsion which the electrifiedtube must exert upon the similarly electrified atoms. This repulsion may perhapsbe sufficient to prevent a large portion of the atoms from striking the tube,but at any rate it must diminish the energy of their impact. It is clear thatwhen the exhaustion is very low, and the rarefied gas well conducting, neitherof the above effects can occur, and, on the other hand, the fewer the atoms,with the greater freedom they move; in other words, the higher the degree ofexhaustion, up to a limit, the more telling will be both the effects.What I have just said may afford an explanation of the phenomenon observed byProf. Crookes, namely, that a discharge through a bulb is established with muchgreater facility when an insulator than when a conductor is present in the same.In my opinion, the conductor acts as a dampener of the motion of the atoms inthe two ways pointed out; hence, to cause a visible discharge to pass throughthe bulb, a much higher potential is needed if a conductor, especially of muchsurface, be present.For the sake of elucidating of some of the remarks before made, I must now referto Figs. 147, 148 and 149, which illustrate various arrangements with a type ofbulb most generally used.images [images/fig147.jpg]FIG. 147.images [images/fig148.jpg]FIG. 148.images [images/fig149.jpg]FIG. 149.Fig. 147 is a section through a spherical bulb L, with the glass stem s,contains the leading-in wire w, which has a lamp filament l fastened to it,serving to support the refractory button m in the center. M is a sheet of thinmica wound in several layers around the stem s, and a is the aluminum tube.Fig. 148 illustrates such a bulb in a somewhat more advanced stage ofperfection. A metallic tube S is fastened by means of some cement to the neck ofthe tube. In the tube is screwed a plug P, of insulating material, in the centerof which is fastened a metallic terminal t, for the connection to the leading-inwire w. This terminal must be well insulated from the metal tube S; therefore,if the cement used is conducting—and most generally it is sufficiently so—thespace between the plug P and the neck of the bulb should be filled with somegood insulating material, such as mica powder.Fig. 149 shows a bulb made for experimental purposes. In this bulb the aluminumtube is provided with an external connection, which serves to investigate theeffect of the tube under various conditions. It is referred to chiefly tosuggest a line of experiment followed.Since the bombardment against the stem containing the leading-in wire is due tothe inductive action of the latter upon the rarefied gas, it is of advantage toreduce this action as far as practicable by employing a very thin wire,surrounded by a very thick insulation of glass or other material, and by makingthe wire passing through the rarefied gas as short as practicable. To combinethese features I employ a large tube T (Fig. 150), which protrudes into the bulbto some distance, and carries on the top a very short glass stem s, into whichis sealed the leading-in wire w, and I protect the top of the glass stem againstthe heat by a small aluminum tube a and a layer of mica underneath the same, asusual. The wire w, passing through the large tube to the outside of the bulb,should be well insulated—with a glass tube, for instance—and the space betweenought to be filled out with some excellent insulator. Among many insulatingpowders I have found that mica powder is the best to employ. If this precautionis not taken, the tube T, protruding into the bulb, will surely be cracked inconsequence of the heating by the brushes which are apt to form in the upperpart of the tube, near the exhausted globe, especially if the vacuum beexcellent, and therefore the potential necessary to operate the lamp be veryhigh.images [images/fig150.jpg]FIG. 150.Fig. 151 illustrates a similar arrangement, with a large tube T protruding intothe part of the bulb containing the refractory button m. In this case the wireleading from the outside into the bulb is omitted, the energy required beingsupplied through condenser coatings C C. The insulating packing P should in thisconstruction be tightly fitting to the glass, and rather wide, or otherwise thedischarge might avoid passing through the wire w, which connects the insidecondenser coating to the incandescent button m.images [images/fig151.jpg]FIG. 151.The molecular bombardment against the glass stem in the bulb is a source ofgreat trouble. As an illustration I will cite a phenomenon only too frequentlyand unwillingly observed. A bulb, preferably a large one, may be taken, and agood conducting body, such as a piece of carbon, may be mounted in it upon aplatinum wire sealed in the glass stem. The bulb may be exhausted to a fairlyhigh degree, nearly to the point when phosphorescence begins to appear. When thebulb is connected with the coil, the piece of carbon, if small, may becomehighly incandescent at first, but its brightness immediately diminishes, andthen the discharge may break through the glass somewhere in the middle of thestem, in the form of bright sparks, in spite of the fact that the platinum wireis in good electrical connection with the rarefied gas through the piece ofcarbon or metal at the top. The first sparks are singularly bright, recallingthose drawn from a clear surface of mercury. But, as they heat the glassrapidly, they, of course, lose their brightness, and cease when the glass at theruptured place becomes incandescent, or generally sufficiently hot to conduct.When observed for the first time the phenomenon must appear very curious, andshows in a striking manner how radically different alternate currents, orimpulses, of high frequency behave, as compared with steady currents, orcurrents of low frequency. With such currents—namely, the latter—the phenomenonwould of course not occur. When frequencies such as are obtained by mechanicalmeans are used, I think that the rupture of the glass is more or less theconsequence of the bombardment, which warms it up and impairs its insulatingpower; but with frequencies obtainable with condensers I have no doubt that theglass may give way without previous heating. Although this appears most singularat first, it is in reality what we might expect to occur. The energy supplied tothe wire leading into the bulb is given off partly by direct action through thecarbon button, and partly by inductive action through the glass surrounding thewire. The case is thus analogous to that in which a condenser shunted by aconductor of low resistance is connected to a source of alternating current. Aslong as the frequencies are low, the conductor gets the most and the condenseris perfectly safe; but when the frequency becomes excessive, the role of theconductor may become quite insignificant. In the latter case the difference ofpotential at the terminals of the condenser may become so great as to rupturethe dielectric, notwithstanding the fact that the terminals are joined by aconductor of low resistance.It is, of course, not necessary, when it is desired to produce the incandescenceof a body inclosed in a bulb by means of these currents, that the body should bea conductor, for even a perfect non-conductor may be quite as readily heated.For this purpose it is sufficient to surround a conducting electrode with anon-conducting material, as, for instance, in the bulb described before in Fig.150, in which a thin incandescent lamp filament is coated with a nonconductor,and supports a button of the same material on the top. At the start thebombardment goes on by inductive action through the non-conductor, until thesame is sufficiently heated to become conducting, when the bombardment continuesin the ordinary way.A different arrangement used in some of the bulbs constructed is illustrated inFig. 152. In this instance a non-conductor m is mounted in a piece of common arclight carbon so as to project some small distance above the latter. The carbonpiece is connected to the leading-in wire passing through a glass stem, which iswrapped with several layers of mica. An aluminum tube a is employed as usual forscreening. It is so arranged that it reaches very nearly as high as the carbonand only the non-conductor m projects a little above it. The bombardment goes atfirst against the upper surface of carbon, the lower parts being protected bythe aluminum tube. As soon, however, as the non-conductor m is heated it isrendered good conducting, and then it becomes the center of the bombardment,being most exposed to the same.images [images/fig152.jpg]FIG. 152.I have also constructed during these experiments many such single-wire bulbswith or without internal electrode, in which the radiant matter was projectedagainst, or focused upon, the body to be rendered incandescent. Fig. 153 (page263 [35_Chapter27.xhtml#page_263]) illustrates one of the bulbs used. Itconsists of a spherical globe L, provided with a long neck n, on top, forincreasing the action in some cases by the application of an external conductingcoating. The globe L is blown out on the bottom into a very small bulb b, whichserves to hold it firmly in a socket S of insulating material into which it iscemented. A fine lamp filament f, supported on a wire w, passes through thecenter of the globe L. The filament is rendered incandescent in the middleportion, where the bombardment proceeding from the lower inside surface of theglobe is most intense. The lower portion of the globe, as far as the socket Sreaches, is rendered conducting, either by a tinfoil coating or otherwise, andthe external electrode is connected to a terminal of the coil.The arrangement diagrammatically indicated in Fig. 153 was found to be aninferior one when it was desired to render incandescent a filament or buttonsupported in the center of the globe, but it was convenient when the object wasto excite phosphorescence.In many experiments in which bodies of different kind were mounted in the bulbas, for instance, indicated in Fig. 152, some observations of interest weremade.It was found, among other things, that in such cases, no matter where thebombardment began, just as soon as a high temperature was reached there wasgenerally one of the bodies which seemed to take most of the bombardment uponitself, the other, or others, being thereby relieved. The quality appeared todepend principally on the point of fusion, and on the facility with which thebody was “evaporated,” or, generally speaking, disintegrated—meaning by thelatter term not only the throwing off of atoms, but likewise of large lumps. Theobservation made was in accordance with generally accepted notions. In a highlyexhausted bulb, electricity is carried off from the electrode by independentcarriers, which are partly the atoms, or molecules, of the residual atmosphere,and partly the atoms, molecules, or lumps thrown off from the electrode. If theelectrode is composed of bodies of different character, and if one of these ismore easily disintegrated than the other, most of the electricity supplied iscarried off from that body, which is then brought to a higher temperature thanthe others, and this the more, as upon an increase of the temperature the bodyis still more easily disintegrated.It seems to me quite probable that a similar process takes place in the bulbeven with a homogeneous electrode, and I think it to be the principal cause ofthe disintegration. There is bound to be some irregularity, even if the surfaceis highly polished, which, of course, is impossible with most of the refractorybodies employed as electrodes. Assume that a point of the electrode gets hotter;instantly most of the discharge passes through that point, and a minute patch itprobably fused and evaporated. It is now possible that in consequence of theviolent disintegration the spot attacked sinks in temperature, or that a counterforce is created, as in an arc; at any rate, the local tearing off meets withthe limitations incident to the experiment, whereupon the same process occurs onanother place. To the eye the electrode appears uniformly brilliant, but thereare upon it points constantly shifting and wandering around, of a temperaturefar above the mean, and this materially hastens the process of deterioration.That some such thing occurs, at least when the electrode is at a lowertemperature, sufficient experimental evidence can be obtained in the followingmanner: Exhaust a bulb to a very high degree, so that with a fairly highpotential the discharge cannot pass—that is, not a luminous one, for a weakinvisible discharge occurs always, in all probability. Now raise slowly andcarefully the potential, leaving the primary current on no more than for aninstant. At a certain point, two, three, or half a dozen phosphorescent spotswill appear on the globe. These places of the glass are evidently more violentlybombarded than others, this being due to the unevenly distributed electricdensity, necessitated, of course, by sharp projections, or, generally speaking,irregularities of the electrode. But the luminous patches are constantlychanging in position, which is especially well observable if one manages toproduce very few, and this indicates that the configuration of the electrode israpidly changing.From experiences of this kind I am led to infer that, in order to be mostdurable, the refractory button in the bulb should be in the form of a spherewith a highly polished surface. Such a small sphere could be manufactured from adiamond or some other crystal, but a better way would be to fuse, by theemployment of extreme degrees of temperature, some oxide—as, for instance,zirconia—into a small drop, and then keep it in the bulb at a temperaturesomewhat below its point of fusion.Interesting and useful results can, no doubt, be reached in the direction ofextreme degrees of heat. How can such high temperatures be arrived at? How arethe highest degrees of heat reached in nature? By the impact of stars, by highspeeds and collisions. In a collision any rate of heat generation may beattained. In a chemical process we are limited. When oxygen and hydrogencombine, they fall, metaphorically speaking, from a definite height. We cannotgo very far with a blast, nor by confining heat in a furnace, but in anexhausted bulb we can concentrate any amount of energy upon a minute button.Leaving practicability out of consideration, this, then, would be the meanswhich, in my opinion, would enable us to reach the highest temperature. But agreat difficulty when proceeding in this way is encountered, namely, in mostcases the body is carried off before it can fuse and form a drop. Thisdifficulty exists principally with an oxide, such as zirconia, because it cannotbe compressed in so hard a cake that it would not be carried off quickly. I haveendeavored repeatedly to fuse zirconia, placing it in a cup of arc light carbon,as indicated in Fig. 152. It glowed with a most intense light, and the stream ofthe particles projected out of the carbon cup was of a vivid white; but whetherit was compressed in a cake or made into a paste with carbon, it was carried offbefore it could be fused. The carbon cup, containing zirconia, had to be mountedvery low in the neck of a large bulb, as the heating of the glass by theprojected particles of the oxide was so rapid that in the first trial the bulbwas cracked almost in an instant, when the current was turned on. The heating ofthe glass by the projected particles was found to be always greater when thecarbon cup contained a body which was rapidly carried off—I presume, because insuch cases, with the same potential, higher speeds were reached, and alsobecause, per unit of time, more matter was projected—that is, more particleswould strike the glass.The before-mentioned difficulty did not exist, however, when the body mounted inthe carbon cup offered great resistance to deterioration. For instance, when anoxide was first fused in an oxygen blast, and then mounted in the bulb, itmelted very readily into a drop.Generally, during the process of fusion, magnificent light effects were noted,of which it would be difficult to give an adequate idea. Fig. 152 is intended toillustrate the effect observed with a ruby drop. At first one may see a narrowfunnel of white light projected against the top of the globe, where it producesan irregularly outlined phosphorescent patch. When the point of the ruby fuses,the phosphorescence becomes very powerful; but as the atoms are projected withmuch greater speed from the surface of the drop, soon the glass gets hot and“tired,” and now only the outer edge of the patch glows. In this manner anintensely phosphorescent, sharply defined line, l, corresponding to the outlineof the drop, is produced, which spreads slowly over the globe as the drop getslarger. When the mass begins to boil, small bubbles and cavities are formed,which cause dark colored spots to sweep across the globe. The bulb may be turneddownward without fear of the drop falling off, as the mass possessesconsiderable viscosity.I may mention here another feature of some interest, which I believe to havenoted in the course of these experiments, though the observations do not amountto a certitude. It appeared that under the molecular impact caused by therapidly alternating potential, the body was fused and maintained in that stateat a lower temperature in a highly exhausted bulb than was the case at normalpressure and application of heat in the ordinary way—that is, at least, judgingfrom the quantity of the light emitted. One of the experiments performed may bementioned here by way of illustration. A small piece of pumice stone was stuckon a platinum wire, and first melted to it in a gas burner. The wire was nextplaced between two pieces of charcoal, and a burner applied, so as to produce anintense heat, sufficient to melt down the pumice stone into a small glass-likebutton. The platinum wire had to be taken of sufficient thickness, to preventits melting in the fire. While in the charcoal fire, or when held in a burner toget a better idea of the degree of heat, the button glowed with greatbrilliancy. The wire with the button was then mounted in a bulb, and uponexhausting the same to a high degree, the current was turned on slowly, so as toprevent the cracking of the button. The button was heated to the point offusion, and when it melted, it did not, apparently, glow with the samebrilliancy as before, and this would indicate a lower temperature. Leaving outof consideration the observer’s possible, and even probable, error, the questionis, can a body under these conditions be brought from a solid to a liquid statewith the evolution of less light?When the potential of a body is rapidly alternated, it is certain that thestructure is jarred. When the potential is very high, although the vibrationsmay be few—say 20,000 per second—the effect upon the structure may beconsiderable. Suppose, for example, that a ruby is melted into a drop by asteady application of energy. When it forms a drop, it will emit visible andinvisible waves, which will be in a definite ratio, and to the eye the drop willappear to be of a certain brilliancy. Next, suppose we diminish to any degree wechoose the energy steadily supplied, and, instead, supply energy which rises andfalls according to a certain law. Now, when the drop is formed, there will beemitted from it three different kinds of vibrations—the ordinary visible, andtwo kinds of invisible waves: that is, the ordinary dark waves of all lengths,and, in addition, waves of a well defined character. The latter would not existby a steady supply of the energy; still they help to jar and loosen thestructure. If this really be the case, then the ruby drop will emit relativelyless visible and more invisible waves than before. Thus it would seem that whena platinum wire, for instance, is fused by currents alternating with extremerapidity, it emits at the point of fusion less light and more visible radiationthan it does when melted by a steady current, though the total energy used up inthe process of fusion is the same in both cases. Or, to cite another example, alamp filament is not capable of withstanding as long with currents of extremefrequency as it does with steady currents, assuming that it be worked at thesame luminous intensity. This means that for rapidly alternating currents thefilament should be shorter and thicker. The higher the frequency—that is, thegreater the departure from the steady flow—the worse it would be for thefilament. But if the truth of this remark were demonstrated, it would beerroneous to conclude that such a refractory button as used in these bulbs wouldbe deteriorated quicker by currents of extremely high frequency than by steadyor low frequency currents. From experience I may say that just the oppositeholds good: the button withstands the bombardment better with currents of veryhigh frequency. But this is due to the fact that a high frequency dischargepasses through a rarefied gas with much greater freedom than a steady or lowfrequency discharge, and this will mean that with the former we can work with alower potential or with a less violent impact. As long, then, as the gas is ofno consequence, a steady or low frequency current is better; but as soon as theaction of the gas is desired and important, high frequencies are preferable.In the course of these experiments a great many trials were made with all kindsof carbon buttons. Electrodes made of ordinary carbon buttons were decidedlymore durable when the buttons were obtained by the application of enormouspressure. Electrodes prepared by depositing carbon in well known ways did notshow up well; they blackened the globe very quickly. From many experiences Iconclude that lamp filaments obtained in this manner can be advantageously usedonly with low potentials and low frequency currents. Some kinds of carbonwithstand so well that, in order to bring them to the point of fusion, it isnecessary to employ very small buttons. In this case the observation is renderedvery difficult on account of the intense heat produced. Nevertheless there canbe no doubt that all kinds of carbon are fused under the molecular bombardment,but the liquid state must be one of great instability. Of all the bodies triedthere were two which withstood best—diamond and carborundum. These two showed upabout equally, but the latter was preferable for many reasons. As it is morethan likely that this body is not yet generally known, I will venture to callyour attention to it.It has been recently produced by Mr. E. G. Acheson, of Monongahela City, Pa.,U.S.A. It is intended to replace ordinary diamond powder for polishing preciousstones, etc., and I have been informed that it accomplishes this object quitesuccessfully. I do not know why the name “carborundum” has been given to it,unless there is something in the process of its manufacture which justifies thisselection. Through the kindness of the inventor, I obtained a short while agosome samples which I desired to test in regard to their qualities ofphosphorescence and capability of withstanding high degrees of heat.Carborundum can be obtained in two forms—in the form of “crystals” and ofpowder. The former appear to the naked eye dark colored, but are very brilliant;the latter is of nearly the same color as ordinary diamond powder, but very muchfiner. When viewed under a microscope the samples of crystals given to me didnot appear to have any definite form, but rather resembled pieces of broken upegg coal of fine quality. The majority were opaque, but there were some whichwere transparent and colored. The crystals are a kind of carbon containing someimpurities; they are extremely hard, and withstand for a long time even anoxygen blast. When the blast is directed against them they at first form a cakeof some compactness, probably in consequence of the fusion of impurities theycontain. The mass withstands for a very long time the blast without furtherfusion; but a slow carrying off, or burning, occurs, and, finally, a smallquantity of a glass-like residue is left, which, I suppose, is melted alumina.When compressed strongly they conduct very well, but not as well as ordinarycarbon. The powder, which is obtained from the crystals in some way, ispractically nonconducting. It affords a magnificent polishing material forstones.The time has been too short to make a satisfactory study of the properties ofthis product, but enough experience has been gained in a few weeks I haveexperimented upon it to say that it does possess some remarkable properties inmany respects. It withstands excessively high degrees of heat, it is littledeteriorated by molecular bombardment, and it does not blacken the globe asordinary carbon does. The only difficulty which I have experienced in its use inconnection with these experiments was to find some binding material which wouldresist the heat and the effect of the bombardment as successfully as carborundumitself does.I have here a number of bulbs which I have provided with buttons of carborundum.To make such a button of carborundum crystals I proceed in the following manner:I take an ordinary lamp filament and dip its point in tar, or some other thicksubstance or paint which may be readily carbonized. I next pass the point of thefilament through the crystals, and then hold it vertically over a hot plate. Thetar softens and forms a drop on the point of the filament, the crystals adheringto the surface of the drop. By regulating the distance from the plate the tar isslowly dried out and the button becomes solid. I then once more dip the buttonin tar and hold it again over a plate until the tar is evaporated, leaving onlya hard mass which firmly binds the crystals. When a larger button is required Irepeat the process several times, and I generally also cover the filament acertain distance below the button with crystals. The button being mounted in abulb, when a good vacuum has been reached, first a weak and then a strongdischarge is passed through the bulb to carbonize the tar and expel all gases,and later it is brought to a very intense incandescence.When the powder is used I have found it best to proceed as follows: I make athick paint of carborundum and tar, and pass a lamp filament through the paint.Taking then most of the paint off by rubbing the filament against a piece ofchamois leather, I hold it over a hot plate until the tar evaporates and thecoating becomes firm. I repeat this process as many times as it is necessary toobtain a certain thickness of coating. On the point of the coated filament Iform a button in the same manner.There is no doubt that such a button—properly prepared under great pressure—ofcarborundum, especially of powder of the best quality, will withstand the effectof the bombardment fully as well as anything we know. The difficulty is that thebinding material gives way, and the carborundum is slowly thrown off after sometime. As it does not seem to blacken the globe in the least, it might be founduseful for coating the filaments of ordinary incandescent lamps, and I thinkthat it is even possible to produce thin threads or sticks of carborundum whichwill replace the ordinary filaments in an incandescent lamp. A carborundumcoating seems to be more durable than other coatings, not only because thecarborundum can withstand high degrees of heat, but also because it seems tounite with the carbon better than any other material I have tried. A coating ofzirconia or any other oxide, for instance, is far more quickly destroyed. Iprepared buttons of diamond dust in the same manner as of carborundum, and thesecame in durability nearest to those prepared of carborundum, but the bindingpaste gave way much more quickly in the diamond buttons; this, however, Iattributed to the size and irregularity of the grains of the diamond.It was of interest to find whether carborundum possesses the quality ofphosphorescence. One is, of course, prepared to encounter two difficulties:first, as regards the rough product, the “crystals,” they are good conducting,and it is a fact that conductors do not phosphoresce; second, the powder, beingexceedingly fine, would not be apt to exhibit very prominently this quality,since we know that when crystals, even such as diamond or ruby, are finelypowdered, they lose the property of phosphorescence to a considerable degree.The question presents itself here, can a conductor phosphoresce? What is therein such a body as a metal, for instance, that would deprive it of the quality ofphosphoresence, unless it is that property which characterizes it as aconductor? For it is a fact that most of the phosphorescent bodies lose thatquality when they are sufficiently heated to become more or less conducting.Then, if a metal be in a large measure, or perhaps entirely, deprived of thatproperty, it should be capable of phosphoresence. Therefore it is quite possiblethat at some extremely high frequency, when behaving practically as anon-conductor, a metal or any other conductor might exhibit the quality ofphosphoresence, even though it be entirely incapable of phosphorescing under theimpact of a low-frequency discharge. There is, however, another possible way howa conductor might at least appear to phosphoresce.Considerable doubt still exists as to what really is phosphorescence, and as towhether the various phenomena comprised under this head are due to the samecauses. Suppose that in an exhausted bulb, under the molecular impact, thesurface of a piece of metal or other conductor is rendered strongly luminous,but at the same time it is found that it remains comparatively cool, would notthis luminosity be called phosphorescence? Now such a result, theoretically atleast, is possible, for it is a mere question of potential or speed. Assume thepotential of the electrode, and consequently the speed of the projected atoms,to be sufficiently high, the surface of the metal piece, against which the atomsare projected, would be rendered highly incandescent, since the process of heatgeneration would be incomparably faster than that of radiating or conductingaway from the surface of the collision. In the eye of the observer a singleimpact of the atoms would cause an instantaneous flash, but if the impacts wererepeated with sufficient rapidity, they would produce a continuous impressionupon his retina. To him then the surface of the metal would appear continuouslyincandescent and of constant luminous intensity, while in reality the lightwould be either intermittent, or at least changing periodically in intensity.The metal piece would rise in temperature until equilibrium was attained—thatis, until the energy continuously radiated would equal that intermittentlysupplied. But the supplied energy might under such conditions not be sufficientto bring the body to any more than a very moderate mean temperature, especiallyif the frequency of the atomic impacts be very low—just enough that thefluctuation of the intensity of the light emitted could not be detected by theeye. The body would now, owing to the manner in which the energy is supplied,emit a strong light, and yet be at a comparatively very low mean temperature.How should the observer name the luminosity thus produced? Even if the analysisof the light would teach him something definite, still he would probably rank itunder the phenomena of phosphorescence. It is conceivable that in such a wayboth conducting and non-conducting bodies may be maintained at a certainluminous intensity, but the energy required would very greatly vary with thenature and properties of the bodies.These and some foregoing remarks of a speculative nature were made merely tobring out curious features of alternate currents or electric impulses. By theirhelp we may cause a body to emit more light, while at a certain meantemperature, than it would emit if brought to that temperature by a steadysupply; and, again, we may bring a body to the point of fusion, and cause it toemit less light than when fused by the application of energy in ordinary ways.It all depends on how we supply the energy, and what kind of vibrations we setup; in one case the vibrations are more, in the other less, adapted to affectour sense of vision.Some effects, which I had not observed before, obtained with carborundum in thefirst trials, I attributed to phosphorescence, but in subsequent experiments itappeared that it was devoid of that quality. The crystals possess a noteworthyfeature. In a bulb provided with a single electrode in the shape of a smallcircular metal disc, for instance, at a certain degree of exhaustion theelectrode is covered with a milky film, which is separated by a dark space fromthe glow filling the bulb. When the metal disc is covered with carborundumcrystals, the film is far more intense, and snow-white. This I found later to bemerely an effect of the bright surface of the crystals, for when an aluminumelectrode was highly polished, it exhibited more or less the same phenomenon. Imade a number of experiments with the samples of crystals obtained, principallybecause it would have been of special interest to find that they are capable ofphosphorescence, on account of their being conducting. I could not producephosphorescence distinctly, but I must remark that a decisive opinion cannot beformed until other experimenters have gone over the same ground.The powder behaved in some experiments as though it contained alumina, but itdid not exhibit with sufficient distinctness the red of the latter. Its deadcolor brightens considerably under the molecular impact, but I am now convincedit does not phosphoresce. Still, the tests with the powder are not conclusive,because powdered carborundum probably does not behave like a phosphorescentsulphide, for example, which could be finely powdered without impairing thephosphorescence, but rather like powdered ruby or diamond, and therefore itwould be necessary, in order to make a decisive test, to obtain it in a largelump and polish up the surface.If the carborundum proves useful in connection with these and similarexperiments, its chief value will be found in the production of coatings, thinconductors, buttons, or other electrodes capable of withstanding extremely highdegrees of heat.The production of a small electrode, capable of withstanding enormoustemperatures, I regard as of the greatest importance in the manufacture oflight. It would enable us to obtain, by means of currents of very highfrequencies, certainly 20 times, if not more, the quantity of light which isobtained in the present incandescent lamp by the same expenditure of energy.This estimate may appear to many exaggerated, but in reality I think it is farfrom being so. As this statement might be misunderstood, I think it is necessaryto expose clearly the problem with which, in this line of work, we areconfronted, and the manner in which, in my opinion, a solution will be arrivedat.Any one who begins a study of the problem will be apt to think that what iswanted in a lamp with an electrode is a very high degree of incandescence of theelectrode. There he will be mistaken. The high incandescence of the button is anecessary evil, but what is really wanted is the high incandescence of the gassurrounding the button. In other words, the problem in such a lamp is to bring amass of gas to the highest possible incandescence. The higher the incandescence,the quicker the mean vibration, the greater is the economy of the lightproduction. But to maintain a mass of gas at a high degree of incandescence in aglass vessel, it will always be necessary to keep the incandescent mass awayfrom the glass; that is, to confine it as much as possible to the centralportion of the globe.In one of the experiments this evening a brush was produced at the end of awire. The brush was a flame, a source of heat and light. It did not emit muchperceptible heat, nor did it glow with an intense light; but is it the less aflame because it does not scorch my hand? Is it the less a flame because it doesnot hurt my eyes by its brilliancy? The problem is precisely to produce in thebulb such a flame, much smaller in size, but incomparably more powerful. Werethere means at hand for producing electric impulses of a sufficiently highfrequency, and for transmitting them, the bulb could be done away with, unlessit were used to protect the electrode, or to economize the energy by confiningthe heat. But as such means are not at disposal, it becomes necessary to placethe terminal in the bulb and rarefy the air in the same. This is done merely toenable the apparatus to perform the work which it is not capable of performingat ordinary air pressure. In the bulb we are able to intensify the action to anydegree—so far that the brush emits a powerful light.The intensity of the light emitted depends principally on the frequency andpotential of the impulses, and on the electric density on the surface of theelectrode. It is of the greatest importance to employ the smallest possiblebutton, in order to push the density very far. Under the violent impact of themolecules of the gas surrounding it, the small electrode is of course brought toan extremely high temperature, but around it is a mass of highly incandescentgas, a flame photosphere, many hundred times the volume of the electrode. With adiamond, carborundum or zirconia button the photosphere can be as much as onethousand times the volume of the button. Without much reflection one would thinkthat in pushing so far the incandescence of the electrode it would be instantlyvolatilized. But after a careful consideration one would find that,theoretically, it should not occur, and in this fact—which, moreover, isexperimentally demonstrated—lies principally the future value of such a lamp.At first, when the bombardment begins, most of the work is performed on thesurface of the button, but when a highly conducting photosphere is formed thebutton is comparatively relieved. The higher the incandescence of thephotosphere, the more it approaches in conductivity to that of the electrode,and the more, therefore, the solid and the gas form one conducting body. Theconsequence is that the further the incandescence is forced the more work,comparatively, is performed on the gas, and the less on the electrode. Theformation of a powerful photosphere is consequently the very means forprotecting the electrode. This protection, of course, is a relative one, and itshould not be thought that by pushing the incandescence higher the electrode isactually less deteriorated. Still, theoretically, with extreme frequencies, thisresult must be reached, but probably at a temperature too high for most of therefractory bodies known. Given, then, an electrode which can withstand to a veryhigh limit the effect of the bombardment and outward strain, it would be safe,no matter how much it was forced beyond that limit. In an incandescent lampquite different considerations apply. There the gas is not at all concerned; thewhole of the work is performed on the filament; and the life of the lampdiminishes so rapidly with the increase of the degree of incandescence thateconomical reasons compel us to work it at a low incandescence. But if anincandescent lamp is operated with currents of very high frequency, the actionof the gas cannot be neglected, and the rules for the most economical workingmust be considerably modified.In order to bring such a lamp with one or two electrodes to a great perfection,it is necessary to employ impulses of very high frequency. The high frequencysecures, among others, two chief advantages, which have a most important bearingupon the economy of the light production. First, the deterioration of theelectrode is reduced by reason of the fact that we employ a great many smallimpacts, instead of a few violent ones, which quickly shatter the structure;secondly, the formation of a large photosphere is facilitated.In order to reduce the deterioration of the electrode to the minimum, it isdesirable that the vibration be harmonic, for any suddenness hastens the processof destruction. An electrode lasts much longer when kept at incandescence bycurrents, or impulses, obtained from a high frequency alternator, which rise andfall more or less harmonically, than by impulses obtained from a disruptivedischarge coil. In the latter case there is no doubt that most of the damage isdone by the fundamental sudden discharges.One of the elements of loss in such a lamp is the bombardment of the globe. Asthe potential is very high, the molecules are projected with great speed; theystrike the glass, and usually excite a strong phosphorescence. The effectproduced is very pretty, but for economical reasons it would be perhapspreferable to prevent, or at least reduce to a minimum, the bombardment againstthe globe, as in such case it is, as a rule, not the object to excitephosphorescence, and as some loss of energy results from the bombardment. Thisloss in the bulb is principally dependent on the potential of the impulses andon the electric density on the surface of the electrode. In employing very highfrequencies the loss of energy by the bombardment is greatly reduced, for,first, the potential needed to perform a given amount of work is much smaller;and, secondly, by producing a highly conducting photosphere around theelectrode, the same result is obtained as though the electrode were much larger,which is equivalent to a smaller electric density. But be it by the diminutionof the maximum potential or of the density, the gain is effected in the samemanner, namely, by avoiding violent shocks, which strain the glass much beyondits limit of elasticity. If the frequency could be brought high enough, the lossdue to the imperfect elasticity of the glass would be entirely negligible. Theloss due to bombardment of the globe may, however, be reduced by using twoelectrodes instead of one. In such case each of the electrodes may be connectedto one of the terminals; or else, if it is preferable to use only one wire, oneelectrode may be connected to one terminal and the other to the ground or to aninsulated body of some surface, as, for instance, a shade on the lamp. In thelatter case, unless some judgment is used, one of the electrodes might glow moreintensely than the other.But on the whole I find it preferable, when using such high frequencies, toemploy only one electrode and one connecting wire. I am convinced that theilluminating device of the near future will not require for its operation morethan one lead, and, at any rate, it will have no leading-in wire, since theenergy required can be as well transmitted through the glass. In experimentalbulbs the leading-in wire is not generally used on account of convenience, as inemploying condenser coatings in the manner indicated in Fig. 151, for example,there is some difficulty in fitting the parts, but these difficulties would notexist if a great many bulbs were manufactured; otherwise the energy can beconveyed through the glass as well as through a wire, and with these highfrequencies the losses are very small. Such illustrating devices willnecessarily involve the use of very high potentials, and this, in the eyes ofpractical men, might be an objectionable feature. Yet, in reality, highpotentials are not objectionable—certainly not in the least so far as the safetyof the devices is concerned.There are two ways of rendering an electric appliance safe. One is to use lowpotentials, the other is to determine the dimensions of the apparatus so that itis safe, no matter how high a potential is used. Of the two, the latter seems tome the better way, for then the safety is absolute, unaffected by any possiblecombination of circumstances which might render even a low-potential appliancedangerous to life and property. But the practical conditions require not onlythe judicious determination of the dimensions of the apparatus; they likewisenecessitate the employment of energy of the proper kind. It is easy, forinstance, to construct a transformer capable of giving, when operated from anordinary alternate current machine of low tension, say 50,000 volts, which mightbe required to light a highly exhausted phosphorescent tube, so that, in spiteof the high potential, it is perfectly safe, the shock from it producing noinconvenience. Still such a transformer would be expensive, and in itselfinefficient; and, besides, what energy was obtained from it would not beeconomically used for the production of light. The economy demands theemployment of energy in the form of extremely rapid vibrations. The problem ofproducing light has been likened to that of maintaining a certain high-pitchnote by means of a bell. It should be said a barely audible note; and even thesewords would not express it, so wonderful is the sensitiveness of the eye. We maydeliver powerful blows at long intervals, waste a good deal of energy, and stillnot get what we want; or we may keep up the note by delivering frequent taps,and get nearer to the object sought by the expenditure of much less energy. Inthe production of light, as far as the illuminating device is concerned, therecan be only one rule—that is, to use as high frequencies as can be obtained; butthe means for the production and conveyance of impulses of such characterimpose, at present at least, great limitations. Once it is decided to use veryhigh frequencies, the return wire becomes unnecessary, and all the appliancesare simplified. By the use of obvious means the same result is obtained asthough the return wire were used. It is sufficient for this purpose to bring incontact with the bulb, or merely in the vicinity of the same, an insulated bodyof some surface. The surface need, of course, be the smaller, the higher thefrequency and potential used, and necessarily, also, the higher the economy ofthe lamp or other device.This plan of working has been resorted to on several occasions this evening. So,for instance, when the incandescence of a button was produced by grasping thebulb with the hand, the body of the experimenter merely served to intensify theaction. The bulb used was similar to that illustrated in Fig. 148, and the coilwas excited to a small potential, not sufficient to bring the button toincandescence when the bulb was hanging from the wire; and incidentally, inorder to perform the experiment in a more suitable manner, the button was takenso large that a perceptible time had to elapse before, upon grasping the bulb,it could be rendered incandescent. The contact with the bulb was, of course,quite unnecessary. It is easy, by using a rather large bulb with an exceedinglysmall electrode, to adjust the conditions so that the latter is brought tobright incandescence by the mere approach of the experimenter within a few feetof the bulb, and that the incandescence subsides upon his receding.In another experiment, when phosphorescence was excited, a similar bulb wasused. Here again, originally, the potential was not sufficient to excitephosphorescence until the action was intensified—in this case, however, topresent a different feature, by touching the socket with a metallic object heldin the hand. The electrode in the bulb was a carbon button so large that itcould not be brought to incandescence, and thereby spoil the effect produced byphosphorescence.Again, in another of the early experiments, a bulb was used, as illustrated inFig. 141. In this instance, by touching the bulb with one or two fingers, one ortwo shadows of the stem inside were projected against the glass, the touch ofthe finger producing the same results as the application of an external negativeelectrode under ordinary circumstances.In all these experiments the action was intensified by augmenting the capacityat the end of the lead connected to the terminal. As a rule, it is not necessaryto resort to such means, and would be quite unnecessary with still higherfrequencies; but when it is desired, the bulb, or tube, can be easily adapted tothe purpose.In Fig. 153, for example, an experimental bulb, L, is shown, which is providedwith a neck, n, on the top, for the application of an external tinfoil coating,which may be connected to a body of larger surface. Such a lamp as illustratedin Fig. 154 may also be lighted by connecting the tinfoil coating on the neck nto the terminal, and the leading-in wire, w, to an insulated plate. If the bulbstands in a socket upright, as shown in the cut, a shade of conducting materialmay be slipped in the neck, n, and the action thus magnified.images [images/fig153.jpg]FIG. 153.images [images/fig154.jpg]FIG. 154.A more perfected arrangement used in some of these bulbs is illustrated in Fig.155. In this case the construction of the bulb is as shown and described before,when reference was made to Fig. 148. A zinc sheet, Z, with a tubular extension,T, is applied over the metallic socket, S. The bulb hangs downward from theterminal, t, the zinc sheet, Z, performing the double office of intensifier andreflector. The reflector is separated from the terminal, t, by an extension ofthe insulating plug, P.images [images/fig155.jpg]FIG. 155.A similar disposition with a phosphorescent tube is illustrated in Fig. 156. Thetube, T, is prepared from two short tubes of different diameter, which aresealed on the ends. On the lower end is placed an inside conducting coating, C,which connects to the wire w. The wire has a hook on the upper end forsuspension, and passes through the center of the inside tube, which is filledwith some good and tightly packed insulator. On the outside of the upper end ofthe tube, T, is another conducting coating, C1, upon which is slipped a metallicreflector Z, which should be separated by a thick insulation from the end ofwire w.images [images/fig156.jpg]FIG. 156.The economical use of such a reflector or intensifier would require that allenergy supplied to an air condenser should be recoverable, or, in other words,that there should not be any losses, neither in the gaseous medium nor throughits action elsewhere. This is far from being so, but, fortunately, the lossesmay be reduced to anything desired. A few remarks are necessary on this subject,in order to make the experiences gathered in the course of these investigationsperfectly clear.Suppose a small helix with many well insulated turns, as in experiment Fig. 146,has one of its ends connected to one of the terminals of the induction coil, andthe other to a metal plate, or, for the sake of simplicity, a sphere, insulatedin space. When the coil is set to work, the potential of the sphere isalternated, and a small helix now behaves as though its free end were connectedto the other terminal of the induction coil. If an iron rod be held within asmall helix, it is quickly brought to a high temperature, indicating the passageof a strong current through the helix. How does the insulated sphere act in thiscase? It can be a condenser, storing and returning the energy supplied to it, orit can be a mere sink of energy, and the conditions of the experiment determinewhether it is rather one than the other. The sphere being charged to a highpotential, it acts inductively upon the surrounding air, or whatever gaseousmedium there might be. The molecules, or atoms, which are near the sphere, areof course more attracted, and move through a greater distance than the fartherones. When the nearest molecules strike the sphere, they are repelled, andcollisions occur at all distances within the inductive action of the sphere. Itis now clear that, if the potential be steady, but little loss of energy can becaused in this way, for the molecules which are nearest to the sphere, havinghad an additional charge imparted to them by contact, are not attracted untilthey have parted, if not with all, at least with most of the additional charge,which can be accomplished only after a great many collisions. From the fact,that with a steady potential there is but little loss in dry air, one must cometo such a conclusion. When the potential of a sphere, instead of being steady,is alternating, the conditions are entirely different. In this case a rhythmicalbombardment occurs, no matter whether the molecules, after coming in contactwith the sphere, lose the imparted charge or not; what is more, if the charge isnot lost, the impacts are only the more violent. Still, if the frequency of theimpulses be very small, the loss caused by the impacts and collisions would notbe serious, unless the potential were excessive. But when extremely highfrequencies and more or less high potentials are used, the loss may be verygreat. The total energy lost per unit of time is proportionate to the product ofthe number of impacts per second, or the frequency and the energy lost in eachimpact. But the energy of an impact must be proportionate to the square of theelectric density of the sphere, since the charge imparted to the molecule isproportionate to that density. I conclude from this that the total energy lostmust be proportionate to the product of the frequency and the square of theelectric density; but this law needs experimental confirmation. Assuming thepreceding considerations to be true, then, by rapidly alternating the potentialof a body immersed in an insulating gaseous medium, any amount of energy may bedissipated into space. Most of that energy then, I believe, is not dissipated inthe form of long ether waves, propagated to considerable distance, as is thoughtmost generally, but is consumed—in the case of an insulated sphere, forexample—in impact and collisional losses—that is, heat vibrations—on the surfaceand in the vicinity of the sphere. To reduce the dissipation, it is necessary towork with a small electric density—the smaller, the higher the frequency.But since, on the assumption before made, the loss is diminished with the squareof the density, and since currents of very high frequencies involve considerablewaste when transmitted through conductors, it follows that, on the whole, it isbetter to employ one wire than two. Therefore, if motors, lamps, or devices ofany kind are perfected, capable of being advantageously operated by currents ofextremely high frequency, economical reasons will make it advisable to use onlyone wire, especially if the distances are great.When energy is absorbed in a condenser, the same behaves as though its capacitywere increased. Absorption always exists more or less, but generally it is smalland of no consequence as long as the frequencies are not very great. In usingextremely high frequencies, and, necessarily in such case, also high potentials,the absorption—or, what is here meant more particularly by this term, the lossof energy due to the presence of a gaseous medium—is an important factor to beconsidered, as the energy absorbed in the air condenser may be any fraction ofthe supplied energy. This would seem to make it very difficult to tell from themeasured or computed capacity of an air condenser its actual capacity orvibration period, especially if the condenser is of very small surface and ischarged to a very high potential. As many important results are dependent uponthe correctness of the estimation of the vibration period, this subject demandsthe most careful scrutiny of other investigators. To reduce the probable erroras much as possible in experiments of the kind alluded to, it is advisable touse spheres or plates of large surface, so as to make the density exceedinglysmall. Otherwise, when it is practicable, an oil condenser should be used inpreference. In oil or other liquid dielectrics there are seemingly no suchlosses as in gaseous media. It being impossible to exclude entirely the gas incondensers with solid dielectrics, such condensers should be immersed in oil,for economical reasons, if nothing else; they can then be strained to theutmost, and will remain cool. In Leyden jars the loss due to air iscomparatively small, as the tinfoil coatings are large, close together, and thecharged surfaces not directly exposed; but when the potentials are very high,the loss may be more or less considerable at, or near, the upper edge of thefoil, where the air is principally acted upon. If the jar be immersed inboiled-out oil, it will be capable of performing four times the amount of workwhich it can for any length of time when used in the ordinary way, and the losswill be inappreciable.It should not be thought that the loss in heat in an air condenser isnecessarily associated with the formation of visible streams or brushes. If asmall electrode, inclosed in an unexhausted bulb, is connected to one of theterminals of the coil, streams can be seen to issue from the electrode, and theair in the bulb is heated; if instead of a small electrode a large sphere isinclosed in the bulb, no streams are observed, still the air is heated.Nor should it be thought that the temperature of an air condenser would giveeven an approximate idea of the loss in heat incurred, as in such case heat mustbe given off much more quickly, since there is, in addition to the ordinaryradiation, a very active carrying away of heat by independent carriers going on,and since not only the apparatus, but the air at some distance from it is heatedin consequence of the collisions which must occur.Owing to this, in experiments with such a coil, a rise of temperature can bedistinctly observed only when the body connected to the coil is very small. Butwith apparatus on a larger scale, even a body of considerable bulk would beheated, as, for instance, the body of a person; and I think that skilledphysicians might make observations of utility in such experiments, which, if theapparatus were judiciously designed, would not present the slightest danger.A question of some interest, principally to meteorologists, presents itselfhere. How does the earth behave? The earth is an air condenser, but is it aperfect or a very imperfect one—a mere sink of energy? There can be little doubtthat to such small disturbance as might be caused in an experiment, the earthbehaves as an almost perfect condenser. But it might be different when itscharge is set in vibration by some sudden disturbance occurring in the heavens.In such case, as before stated, probably only little of the energy of thevibrations set up would be lost into space in the form of long ether radiations,but most of the energy, I think, would spend itself in molecular impacts andcollisions, and pass off into space in the form of short heat, and possiblylight, waves. As both the frequency of the vibrations of the charge and thepotential are in all probability excessive, the energy converted into heat maybe considerable. Since the density must be unevenly distributed, either inconsequence of the irregularity of the earth’s surface, or on account of thecondition of the atmosphere in various places, the effect produced wouldaccordingly vary from place to place. Considerable variations in the temperatureand pressure of the atmosphere may in this manner be caused at any point of thesurface of the earth. The variations may be gradual or very sudden, according tothe nature of the general disturbance, and may produce rain and storms, orlocally modify the weather in any way.From the remarks before made, one may see what an important factor of loss theair in the neighborhood of a charged surface becomes when the electric densityis great and the frequency of the impulses excessive. But the action, asexplained, implies that the air is insulating—that is, that it is composed ofindependent carriers immersed in an insulating medium. This is the case onlywhen the air is at something like ordinary or greater, or at extremely small,pressure. When the air is slightly rarefied and conducting, then true conductionlosses occur also. In such case, of course, considerable energy may bedissipated into space even with a steady potential, or with impulses of lowfrequency, if the density is very great.When the gas is at very low pressure, an electrode is heated more because higherspeeds can be reached. If the gas around the electrode is strongly compressed,the displacements, and consequently the speeds, are very small, and the heatingis insignificant. But if in such case the frequency could be sufficientlyincreased, the electrode would be brought to a high temperature as well as ifthe gas were at very low pressure; in fact, exhausting the bulb is onlynecessary because we cannot produce (and possibly not convey) currents of therequired frequency.Returning to the subject of electrode lamps, it is obviously of advantage insuch a lamp to confine as much as possible the heat to the electrode bypreventing the circulation of the gas in the bulb. If a very small bulb betaken, it would confine the heat better than a large one, but it might not be ofsufficient capacity to be operated from the coil, or, if so, the glass might gettoo hot. A simple way to improve in this direction is to employ a globe of therequired size, but to place a small bulb, the diameter of which is properlyestimated, over the refractory button contained in the globe. This arrangementis illustrated in Fig. 157.images [images/fig157.jpg]FIG. 157.The globe L has in this case a large neck n, allowing the small bulb b to slipthrough. Otherwise the construction is the same as shown in Fig. 147, forexample. The small bulb is conveniently supported upon the stem s, carrying therefractory button m. It is separated from the aluminum tube a by several layersof mica M, in order to prevent the cracking of the neck by the rapid heating ofthe aluminum tube upon a sudden turning on of the current. The inside bulbshould be as small as possible when it is desired to obtain light only byincandescence of the electrode. If it is desired to produce phosphorescence, thebulb should be larger, else it would be apt to get too hot, and thephosphorescence would cease. In this arrangement usually only the small bulbshows phosphorescence, as there is practically no bombardment against the outerglobe. In some of these bulbs constructed as illustrated in Fig. 157, the smalltube was coated with phosphorescent paint, and beautiful effects were obtained.Instead of making the inside bulb large, in order to avoid undue heating, itanswers the purpose to make the electrode m larger. In this case the bombardmentis weakened by reason of the smaller electric density.Many bulbs were constructed on the plan illustrated in Fig. 158. Here a smallbulb b, containing the refractory button m, upon being exhausted to a very highdegree was sealed in a large globe L, which was then moderately exhausted andsealed off. The principal advantage of this construction was that it allowed ofreaching extremely high vacua, and, at the same time of using a large bulb. Itwas found, in the course of experiments with bulbs such as illustrated in Fig.158, that it was well to make the stem s, near the seal at e, very thick, andthe leading-in wire w thin, as it occurred sometimes that the stem at e washeated and the bulb was cracked. Often the outer globe L was exhausted only justenough to allow the discharge to pass through, and the space between the bulbsappeared crimson, producing a curious effect. In some cases, when the exhaustionin globe L was very low, and the air good conducting, it was found necessary, inorder to bring the button m to high incandescence, to place, preferably on theupper part of the neck of the globe, a tinfoil coating which was connected to aninsulated body, to the ground, or to the other terminal of the coil, as thehighly conducting air weakened the effect somewhat, probably by being acted uponinductively from the wire w, where it entered the bulb at e. Anotherdifficulty—which, however, is always present when the refractory button ismounted in a very small bulb—existed in the construction illustrated in Fig.158, namely, the vacuum in the bulb b would be impaired in a comparatively shorttime.images [images/fig158.jpg]FIG. 158.The chief idea in the two last described constructions was to confine the heatto the central portion of the globe by preventing the exchange of air. Anadvantage is secured, but owing to the heating of the inside bulb and slowevaporation of the glass, the vacuum is hard to maintain, even if theconstruction illustrated in Fig. 157 be chosen, in which both bulbs communicate.But by far the better way—the ideal way—would be to reach sufficiently highfrequencies. The higher the frequency, the slower would be the exchange of theair, and I think that a frequency may be reached, at which there would be noexchange whatever of the air molecules around the terminal. We would thenproduce a flame in which there would be no carrying away of material, and aqueer flame it would be, for it would be rigid! With such high frequencies theinertia of the particles would come into play. As the brush, or flame, wouldgain rigidity in virtue of the inertia of the particles, the exchange of thelatter would be prevented. This would necessarily occur, for, the number ofimpulses being augmented, the potential energy of each would diminish, so thatfinally only atomic vibrations could be set up, and the motion of translationthrough measurable space would cease. Thus an ordinary gas burner connected to asource of rapidly alternating potential might have its efficiency augmented to acertain limit, and this for two reasons—because of the additional vibrationimparted, and because of a slowing down of the process of carrying off. But therenewal being rendered difficult, a renewal being necessary to maintain theburner, a continued increase of the frequency of the impulses, assuming theycould be transmitted to and impressed upon the flame, would result in the“extinction” of the latter, meaning by this term only the cessation of thechemical process.I think, however, that in the case of an electrode immersed in a fluidinsulating medium, and surrounded by independent carriers of electric charges,which can be acted upon inductively, a sufficient high frequency of the impulseswould probably result in a gravitation of the gas all around toward theelectrode. For this it would be only necessary to assume that the independentbodies are irregularly shaped; they would then turn toward the electrode theirside of the greatest electric density, and this would be a position in which thefluid resistance to approach would be smaller than that offered to the receding.The general opinion, I do not doubt, is that it is out of the question to reachany such frequencies as might—assuming some of the views before expressed to betrue—produce any of the results which I have pointed out as mere possibilities.This may be so, but in the course of these investigations, from the observationof many phenomena, I have gained the conviction that these frequencies would bemuch lower than one is apt to estimate at first. In a flame we set up lightvibrations by causing molecules, or atoms, to collide. But what is the ratio ofthe frequency of the collisions and that of the vibrations set up? Certainly itmust be incomparably smaller than that of the strokes of the bell and the soundvibrations, or that of the discharges and the oscillations of the condenser. Wemay cause the molecules of the gas to collide by the use of alternate electricimpulses of high frequency, and so we may imitate the process in a flame; andfrom experiments with frequencies which we are now able to obtain, I think thatthe result is producible with impulses which are transmissible through aconductor.In connection with thoughts of a similar nature, it appeared to me of greatinterest to demonstrate the rigidity of a vibrating gaseous column. Althoughwith such low frequencies as, say 10,000 per second, which I was able to obtainwithout difficulty from a specially constructed alternator, the task lookeddiscouraging at first, I made a series of experiments. The trials with air atordinary pressure led to no result, but with air moderately rarefied I obtainwhat I think to be an unmistakable experimental evidence of the property soughtfor. As a result of this kind might lead able investigators to conclusions ofimportance, I will describe one of the experiments performed.It is well known that when a tube is slightly exhausted, the discharge may bepassed through it in the form of a thin luminous thread. When produced withcurrents of low frequency, obtained from a coil operated as usual, this threadis inert. If a magnet be approached to it, the part near the same is attractedor repelled, according to the direction of the lines of force of the magnet. Itoccurred to me that if such a thread would be produced with currents of veryhigh frequency, it should be more or less rigid, and as it was visible it couldbe easily studied. Accordingly I prepared a tube about one inch in diameter andone meter long, with outside coating at each end. The tube was exhausted to apoint at which, by a little working, the thread discharge could be obtained. Itmust be remarked here that the general aspect of the tube, and the degree ofexhaustion, are quite other than when ordinary low frequency currents are used.As it was found preferable to work with one terminal, the tube prepared wassuspended from the end of a wire connected to the terminal, the tinfoil coatingbeing connected to the wire, and to the lower coating sometimes a smallinsulated plate was attached. When the thread was formed, it extended throughthe upper part of the tube and lost itself in the lower end. If it possessedrigidity it resembled, not exactly an elastic cord stretched tight between twosupports, but a cord suspended from a height with a small weight attached at theend. When the finger or a small magnet was approached to the upper end of theluminous thread, it could be brought locally out of position by electrostatic ormagnetic action; and when the disturbing object was very quickly removed, ananalogous result was produced, as though a suspended cord would be displaced andquickly released near the point of suspension. In doing this the luminous threadwas set in vibration, and two very sharply marked nodes, and a third indistinctone, were formed. The vibration, once set up, continued for fully eight minutes,dying gradually out. The speed of the vibration often varied perceptibly, and itcould be observed that the electrostatic attraction of the glass affected thevibrating thread; but it was clear that the electrostatic action was not thecause of the vibration, for the thread was most generally stationary, and couldalways be set in vibration by passing the finger quickly near the upper part ofthe tube. With a magnet the thread could be split in two and both partsvibrated. By approaching the hand to the lower coating of the tube, orinsulation plate if attached, the vibration was quickened; also, as far as Icould see, by raising the potential or frequency. Thus, either increasing thefrequency or passing a stronger discharge of the same frequency corresponded toa tightening of the cord. I did not obtain any experimental evidence withcondenser discharges. A luminous band excited in the bulb by repeated dischargesof a Leyden jar must possess rigidity, and if deformed and suddenly released,should vibrate. But probably the amount of vibrating matter is so small that inspite of the extreme speed, the inertia cannot prominently assert itself.Besides, the observation in such a case is rendered extremely difficult onaccount of the fundamental vibration.The demonstration of the fact—which still needs better experimentalconfirmation—that a vibrating gaseous column possesses rigidity, might greatlymodify the views of thinkers. When with low frequencies and insignificantpotentials indications of that property may be noted, how must a gaseous mediumbehave under the influence of enormous electrostatic stresses which may beactive in the interstellar space, and which may alternate with inconceivablerapidity? The existence of such an electrostatic, rhythmically throbbingforce—of a vibrating electrostatic field—would show a possible way how solidsmight have formed from the ultra-gaseous uterus, and how transverse and allkinds of vibrations may be transmitted through a gaseous medium filling allspace. Then, ether might be a true fluid, devoid of rigidity, and at rest, itbeing merely necessary as a connecting link to enable interaction. Whatdetermines the rigidity of a body? It must be the speed and the amount of motivematter. In a gas the speed maybe considerable, but the density is exceedinglysmall; in a liquid the speed would be likely to be small, though the density maybe considerable; and in both cases the inertia resistance offered todisplacement is practically nil. But place a gaseous (or liquid) column in anintense, rapidly alternating electrostatic field, set the particles vibratingwith enormous speeds, then the inertia resistance asserts itself. A body mightmove with more or less freedom through the vibrating mass, but as a whole itwould be rigid.There is a subject which I must mention in connection with these experiments: itis that of high vacua. This is a subject, the study of which is not onlyinteresting, but useful, for it may lead to results of great practicalimportance. In commercial apparatus, such as incandescent lamps, operated fromordinary systems of distribution, a much higher vacuum than is obtained atpresent would not secure a very great advantage. In such a case the work isperformed on the filament, and the gas is little concerned; the improvement,therefore, would be but trifling. But when we begin to use very high frequenciesand potentials, the action of the gas becomes all important, and the degree ofexhaustion materially modifies the results. As long as ordinary coils, even verylarge ones, were used, the study of the subject was limited, because just at apoint when it became most interesting it had to be interrupted on account of the“non-striking” vacuum being reached. But at present we are able to obtain from asmall disruptive discharge coil potentials much higher than even the largestcoil was capable of giving, and, what is more, we can make the potentialalternate with great rapidity. Both of these results enable us now to pass aluminous discharge through almost any vacua obtainable, and the field of ourinvestigations is greatly extended. Think we as we may, of all the possibledirections to develop a practical illuminant, the line of high vacua seems to bethe most promising at present. But to reach extreme vacua the appliances must bemuch more improved, and ultimate perfection will not be attained until we shallhave discharged the mechanical and perfected an electrical vacuum pump.Molecules and atoms can be thrown out of a bulb under the action of an enormouspotential: this will be the principle of the vacuum pump of the future. For thepresent, we must secure the best results we can with mechanical appliances. Inthis respect, it might not be out of the way to say a few words about the methodof, and apparatus for, producing excessively high degrees of exhaustion of whichI have availed myself in the course of these investigations. It is very probablethat other experimenters have used similar arrangements; but as it is possiblethat there may be an item of interest in their description, a few remarks, whichwill render this investigation more complete, might be permitted.The apparatus is illustrated in a drawing shown in Fig. 159. S represents aSprengel pump, which has been specially constructed to better suit the workrequired. The stopcock which is usually employed has been omitted, and insteadof it a hollow stopper s has been fitted in the neck of the reservoir R. Thisstopper has a small hole h, through which the mercury descends; the size of theoutlet o being properly determined with respect to the section of the fall tubet, which is sealed to the reservoir instead of being connected to it in theusual manner. This arrangement overcomes the imperfections and troubles whichoften arise from the use of the stopcock on the reservoir and the connections ofthe latter with the fall tube.images [images/fig159.jpg]FIG. 159.The pump is connected through a U-shaped tube t to a very large reservoir R1Especial care was taken in fitting the grinding surfaces of the stoppers p andp1, and both of these and the mercury caps above them were made exceptionallylong. After the U-shaped tube was fitted and put in place, it was heated, so asto soften and take off the strain resulting from imperfect fitting. The U-shapedtube was provided with a stopcock C, and two ground connections g and g1—one fora small bulb b, usually containing caustic potash, and the other for thereceiver r, to be exhausted.The reservoir R1, was connected by means of a rubber tube to a slightly largerreservoir R2, each of the two reservoirs being provided with a stopcock C1 andC2 respectively. The reservoir R2 could be raised and lowered by a wheel andrack, and the range of its motion was so determined that when it was filled withmercury and the stopcock C2 closed, so as to form a Torricellian vacuum in itwhen raised, it could be lifted so high that the reservoir R1 would stand alittle above stopcock C1; and when this stopcock was closed and the reservoir R2descended, so as to form a Torricellian vacuum in reservoir R1 it could belowered so far as to completely empty the latter, the mercury filling thereservoir R2 up to a little above stopcock C2.The capacity of the pump and of the connections was taken as small as possiblerelatively to the volume of reservoir, R1 since, of course, the degree ofexhaustion depended upon the ratio of these quantities.With this apparatus I combined the usual means indicated by former experimentsfor the production of very high vacua. In most of the experiments it was mostconvenient to use caustic potash. I may venture to say, in regard to its use,that much time is saved and a more perfect action of the pump insured by fusingand boiling the potash as soon as, or even before, the pump settles down. Ifthis course is not followed, the sticks, as ordinarily employed, may give offmoisture at a certain very slow rate, and the pump may work for many hourswithout reaching a very high vacuum. The potash was heated either by a spiritlamp or by passing a discharge through it, or by passing a current through awire contained in it. The advantage in the latter case was that the heatingcould be more rapidly repeated.Generally the process of exhaustion was the following: At the start, thestopcocks C and C1 being open, and all other connections closed, the reservoirR2 was raised so far that the mercury filled the reservoir R1 and a part of thenarrow connecting U-shaped tube. When the pump was set to work, the mercurywould, of course, quickly rise in the tube, and reservoir R2 was lowered, theexperimenter keeping the mercury at about the same level. The reservoir R2 wasbalanced by a long spring which facilitated the operation, and the friction ofthe parts was generally sufficient to keep it in almost any position. When theSprengel pump had done its work, the reservoir R2 was further lowered and themercury descended in R1 and filled R2, whereupon stopcock C2 was closed. The airadhering to the walls of R1 and that absorbed by the mercury was carried off,and to free the mercury of all air the reservoir R2 was for a long time workedup and down. During this process some air, which would gather below stopcock C2,was expelled from R2 by lowering it far enough and opening the stopcock, closingthe latter again before raising the reservoir. When all the air had beenexpelled from the mercury, and no air would gather in R2 when it was lowered,the caustic potash was resorted to. The reservoir R2 was now again raised untilthe mercury in R1 stood above stopcock C1. The caustic potash was fused andboiled, and moisture partly carried off by the pump and partly re-absorbed; andthis process of heating and cooling was repeated many times, and each time, uponthe moisture being absorbed or carried off, the reservoir R2 was for a long timeraised and lowered. In this manner all the moisture was carried off from themercury, and both the reservoirs were in proper condition to be used. Thereservoir R2 was then again raised to the top, and the pump was kept working fora long time. When the highest vacuum obtainable with the pump had been reached,the potash bulb was usually wrapped with cotton which was sprinkled with etherso as to keep the potash at a very low temperature, then the reservoir R2 waslowered, and upon reservoir R1 being emptied the receiver was quickly sealed up.When a new bulb was put on, the mercury was always raised above stopcock C1,which was closed, so as to always keep the mercury and both the reservoirs infine condition, and the mercury was never withdrawn from R1 except when the pumphad reached the highest degree of exhaustion. It is necessary to observe thisrule if it is desired to use the apparatus to advantage.By means of this arrangement I was able to proceed very quickly, and when theapparatus was in perfect order it was possible to reach the phosphorescent stagein a small bulb in less than fifteen minutes, which is certainly very quick workfor a small laboratory arrangement requiring all in all about 100 pounds ofmercury. With ordinary small bulbs the ratio of the capacity of the pump,receiver, and connections, and that of reservoir R was about 1 to 20, and thedegrees of exhaustion reached were necessarily very high, though I am unable tomake a precise and reliable statement how far the exhaustion was carried.What impresses the investigator most in the course of these experiences is thebehavior of gases when subjected to great rapidly alternating electrostaticstresses. But he must remain in doubt as to whether the effects observed are duewholly to the molecules, or atoms, of the gas which chemical analysis disclosesto us, or whether there enters into play another medium of a gaseous nature,comprising atoms, or molecules, immersed in a fluid pervading the space. Such amedium surely must exist, and I am convinced that, for instance, even if airwere absent, the surface and neighborhood of a body in space would be heated byrapidly alternating the potential of the body; but no such heating of thesurface or neighborhood could occur if all free atoms were removed and only ahomogeneous, incompressible, and elastic fluid—such as ether is supposed tobe—would remain, for then there would be no impacts, no collisions. In such acase, as far as the body itself is concerned, only frictional losses in theinside could occur.It is a striking fact that the discharge through a gas is established withever-increasing freedom as the frequency of the impulses is augmented. Itbehaves in this respect quite contrarily to a metallic conductor. In the latterthe impedance enters prominently into play as the frequency is increased, butthe gas acts much as a series of condensers would; the facility with which thedischarge passes through, seems to depend on the rate of change of potential. Ifit acts so, then in a vacuum tube even of great length, and no matter how strongthe current, self-induction could not assert itself to any appreciable degree.We have, then, as far as we can now see, in the gas a conductor which is capableof transmitting electric impulses of any frequency which we may be able toproduce. Could the frequency be brought high enough, then a queer system ofelectric distribution, which would be likely to interest gas companies, might berealized: metal pipes filled with gas—the metal being the insulator, the gas theconductor—supplying phosphorescent bulbs, or perhaps devices as yet uninvented.It is certainly possible to take a hollow core of copper, rarefy the gas in thesame, and by passing impulses of sufficiently high frequency through a circuitaround it, bring the gas inside to a high degree of incandescence; but as to thenature of the forces there would be considerable uncertainty, for it would bedoubtful whether with such impulses the copper core would act as a staticscreen. Such paradoxes and apparent impossibilities we encounter at every stepin this line of work, and therein lies, to a great extent, the charm of thestudy.I have here a short and wide tube which is exhausted to a high degree andcovered with a substantial coating of bronze, the coating barely allowing thelight to shine through. A metallic cap, with a hook for suspending the tube, isfastened around the middle portion of the latter, the clasp being in contactwith the bronze coating. I now want to light the gas inside by suspending thetube on a wire connected to the coil. Anyone who would try the experiment forthe first time, not having any previous experience, would probably take care tobe quite alone when making the trial, for fear that he might become the joke ofhis assistants. Still, the bulb lights in spite of the metal coating, and thelight can be distinctly perceived through the latter. A long tube covered withaluminum bronze lights when held in one hand—the other touching the terminal ofthe coil—quite powerfully. It might be objected that the coatings are notsufficiently conducting; still, even if they were highly resistant, they oughtto screen the gas. They certainly screen it perfectly in a condition of rest,but far from perfectly when the charge is surging in the coating. But the lossof energy which occurs within the tube, notwithstanding the screen, isoccasioned principally by the presence of the gas. Were we to take a largehollow metallic sphere and fill it with a perfect, incompressible, fluiddielectric, there would be no loss inside of the sphere, and consequently theinside might be considered as perfectly screened, though the potential be veryrapidly alternating. Even were the sphere filled with oil, the loss would beincomparably smaller than when the fluid is replaced by a gas, for in the lattercase the force produces displacements; that means impact and collisions in theinside.No matter what the pressure of the gas may be, it becomes an important factor inthe heating of a conductor when the electric density is great and the frequencyvery high. That in the heating of conductors by lightning discharges, air is anelement of great importance, is almost as certain as an experimental fact. I mayillustrate the action of the air by the following experiment: I take a shorttube which is exhausted to a moderate degree and has a platinum wire runningthrough the middle from one end to the other. I pass a steady or low frequencycurrent through the wire, and it is heated uniformly in all parts. The heatinghere is due to conduction, or frictional losses, and the gas around the wirehas—as far as we can see—no function to perform. But now let me pass suddendischarges, or high frequency currents, through the wire. Again the wire isheated, this time principally on the ends and least in the middle portion; andif the frequency of the impulses, or the rate of change, is high enough, thewire might as well be cut in the middle as not, for practically all heating isdue to the rarefied gas. Here the gas might only act as a conductor of noimpedance diverting the current from the wire as the impedance of the latter isenormously increased, and merely heating the ends of the wire by reason of theirresistance to the passage of the discharge. But it is not at all necessary thatthe gas in the tube should be conducting; it might be at an extremely lowpressure, still the ends of the wire would be heated—as, however, is ascertainedby experience—only the two ends would in such case not be electrically connectedthrough the gaseous medium. Now what with these frequencies and potentialsoccurs in an exhausted tube, occurs in the lightning discharges at ordinarypressure. We only need remember one of the facts arrived at in the course ofthese investigations, namely, that to impulses of very high frequency the gas atordinary pressure behaves much in the same manner as though it were atmoderately low pressure. I think that in lightning discharges frequently wiresor conducting objects are volatilized merely because air is present, and that,were the conductor immersed in an insulating liquid, it would be safe, for thenthe energy would have to spend itself somewhere else. From the behavior of gasesunder sudden impulses of high potential, I am led to conclude that there can beno surer way of diverting a lightning discharge than by affording it a passagethrough a volume of gas, if such a thing can be done in a practical manner.There are two more features upon which I think it necessary to dwell inconnection with these experiments—the “radiant state” and the “non-strikingvacuum.”Any one who has studied Crookes’ work must have received the impression that the“radiant state” is a property of the gas inseparably connected with an extremelyhigh degree of exhaustion. But it should be remembered that the phenomenaobserved in an exhausted vessel are limited to the character and capacity of theapparatus which is made use of. I think that in a bulb a molecule, or atom, doesnot precisely move in a straight line because it meets no obstacle, but becausethe velocity imparted to it is sufficient to propel it in a sensibly straightline. The mean free path is one thing, but the velocity—the energy associatedwith the moving body—is another, and under ordinary circumstances I believe thatit is a mere question of potential or speed. A disruptive discharge coil, whenthe potential is pushed very far, excites phosphorescence and projects shadows,at comparatively low degrees of exhaustion. In a lightning discharge, mattermoves in straight lines at ordinary pressure when the mean free path isexceedingly small, and frequently images of wires or other metallic objects havebeen produced by the particles thrown off in straight lines.I have prepared a bulb to illustrate by an experiment the correctness of theseassertions. In a globe L, Fig. 160, I have mounted upon a lamp filament f apiece of lime l. The lamp filament is connected with a wire which leads into thebulb, and the general construction of the latter is as indicated in Fig. 148,before described. The bulb being suspended from a wire connected to the terminalof the coil, and the latter being set to work, the lime piece l and theprojecting parts of the filament f are bombarded. The degree of exhaustion isjust such that with the potential the coil is capable of giving, phosphorescenceof the glass is produced, but disappears as soon as the vacuum is impaired. Thelime containing moisture, and moisture being given off as soon as heatingoccurs, the phosphorescence lasts only for a few moments. When the lime has beensufficiently heated, enough moisture has been given off to impair materially thevacuum of the bulb. As the bombardment goes on, one point of the lime piece ismore heated than other points, and the result is that finally practically allthe discharge passes through that point which is intensely heated, and a whitestream of lime particles (Fig. 160) then breaks forth from that point. Thisstream is composed of “radiant” matter, yet the degree of exhaustion is low. Butthe particles move in straight lines because the velocity imparted to them isgreat, and this is due to three causes—to the great electric density, the hightemperature of the small point, and the fact that the particles of the lime areeasily torn and thrown off—far more easily than those of carbon. Withfrequencies such as we are able to obtain, the particles are bodily thrown offand projected to a considerable distance; but with sufficiently high frequenciesno such thing would occur; in such case only a stress would spread or avibration would be propagated through the bulb. It would be out of the questionto reach any such frequency on the assumption that the atoms move with the speedof light; but I believe that such a thing is impossible; for this an enormouspotential would be required. With potentials which we are able to obtain, evenwith a disruptive discharge coil, the speed must be quite insignificant.images [images/fig160.jpg]FIG. 160.As to the “non-striking vacuum,” the point to be noted is, that it can occuronly with low frequency impulses, and it is necessitated by the impossibility ofcarrying off enough energy with such impulses in high vacuum, since the fewatoms which are around the terminal upon coming in contact with the same, arerepelled and kept at a distance for a comparatively long period of time, and notenough work can be performed to render the effect perceptible to the eye. If thedifference of potential between the terminals is raised, the dielectric breaksdown. But with very high frequency impulses there is no necessity for suchbreaking down, since any amount of work can be performed by continuallyagitating the atoms in the exhausted vessel, provided the frequency is highenough. It is easy to reach—even with frequencies obtained from an alternator ashere used—a stage at which the discharge does not pass between two electrodes ina narrow tube, each of these being connected to one of the terminals of thecoil, but it is difficult to reach a point at which a luminous discharge wouldnot occur around each electrode.A thought which naturally presents itself in connection with high frequencycurrents, is to make use of their powerful electrodynamic inductive action toproduce light effects in a sealed glass globe. The leading-in wire is one of thedefects of the present incandescent lamp, and if no other improvement were made,that imperfection at least should be done away with. Following this thought, Ihave carried on experiments in various directions, of which some were indicatedin my former paper. I may here mention one or two more lines of experiment whichhave been followed up.Many bulbs were constructed as shown in Fig. 161 and Fig. 162.images [images/fig161.jpg]FIG. 161.images [images/fig162.jpg]FIG. 162.In Fig. 161, a wide tube, T, was sealed to a smaller W-shaped tube U, ofphosphorescent glass. In the tube T, was placed a coil C, of aluminum wire, theends of which were provided with small spheres, t and t1, of aluminum, andreached into the U tube. The tube T was slipped into a socket containing aprimary coil, through which usually the discharges of Leyden jars were directed,and the rarefied gas in the small U tube was excited to strong luminosity by thehigh-tension current induced in the coil C. When Leyden jar discharges were usedto induce currents in the coil C, it was found necessary to pack the tube Ttightly with insulating powder, as a discharge would occur frequently betweenthe turns of the coil, especially when the primary was thick and the air gap,through which the jars discharged, large, and no little trouble was experiencedin this way.In Fig. 162 is illustrated another form of the bulb constructed. In this case atube T is sealed to a globe L. The tube contains a coil C, the ends of whichpass through two small glass tubes t and t1, which are sealed to the tube T. Tworefractory buttons m and m1, are mounted on lamp filaments which are fastened tothe ends of the wires passing through the glass tubes t and t1. Generally inbulbs made on this plan the globe L communicated with the tube T. For thispurpose the ends of the small tubes t and t1 were heated just a trifle in theburner, merely to hold the wires, but not to interfere with the communication.The tube T, with the small tubes, wires through the same, and the refractorybuttons m and m1 were first prepared, and then sealed to globe L, whereupon thecoil C was slipped in and the connections made to its ends. The tube was thenpacked with insulating powder, jamming the latter as tight as possible up tovery nearly the end; then it was closed and only a small hole left through whichthe remainder of the powder was introduced, and finally the end of the tube wasclosed. Usually in bulbs constructed as shown in Fig. 162 an aluminum tube a wasfastened to the upper end s of each of the tubes t and t1 in order to protectthat end against the heat. The buttons m and m1 could be brought to any degreeof incandescence by passing the discharges of Leyden jars around the coil C. Insuch bulbs with two buttons a very curious effect is produced by the formationof the shadows of each of the two buttons.Another line of experiment, which has been assiduously followed, was to induceby electro-dynamic induction a current or luminous discharge in an exhaustedtube or bulb. This matter has received such able treatment at the hands of Prof.J. J. Thomson, that I could add but little to what he has made known, even had Imade it the special subject of this lecture. Still, since experiments in thisline have gradually led me to the present views and results, a few words must bedevoted here to this subject.It has occurred, no doubt, to many that as a vacuum tube is made longer, theelectromotive force per unit length of the tube, necessary to pass a luminousdischarge through the latter, becomes continually smaller; therefore, if theexhausted tube be made long enough, even with low frequencies a luminousdischarge could be induced in such a tube closed upon itself. Such a tube mightbe placed around a hall or on a ceiling, and at once a simple appliance capableof giving considerable light would be obtained. But this would be an appliancehard to manufacture and extremely unmanageable. It would not do to make the tubeup of small lengths, because there would be with ordinary frequenciesconsiderable loss in the coatings, and besides, if coatings were used, it wouldbe better to supply the current directly to the tube by connecting the coatingsto a transformer. But even if all objections of such nature were removed, withlow frequencies the light conversion itself would be inefficient, as I havebefore stated. In using extremely high frequencies the length of thesecondary—in other words, the size of the vessel—can be reduced as much asdesired, and the efficiency of the light conversion is increased, provided thatmeans are invented for efficiently obtaining such high frequencies. Thus one isled, from theoretical and practical considerations, to the use of highfrequencies, and this means high electromotive forces and small currents in theprimary. When one works with condenser charges—and they are the only means up tothe present known for reaching these extreme frequencies—one gets toelectromotive forces of several thousands of volts per turn of the primary. Wecannot multiply the electro-dynamic inductive effect by taking more turns in theprimary, for we arrive at the conclusion that the best way is to work with onesingle turn—though we must sometimes depart from this rule—and we must get alongwith whatever inductive effect we can obtain with one turn. But before one haslong experimented with the extreme frequencies required to set up in a smallbulb an electromotive force of several thousands of volts, one realizes thegreat importance of electrostatic effects, and these effects grow relatively tothe electro-dynamic in significance as the frequency is increased.Now, if anything is desirable in this case, it is to increase the frequency, andthis would make it still worse for the electrodynamic effects. On the otherhand, it is easy to exalt the electrostatic action as far as one likes by takingmore turns on the secondary, or combining self-induction and capacity to raisethe potential. It should also be remembered that, in reducing the current to thesmallest value and increasing the potential, the electric impulses of highfrequency can be more easily transmitted through a conductor.These and similar thoughts determined me to devote more attention to theelectrostatic phenomena, and to endeavor to produce potentials as high aspossible, and alternating as fast as they could be made to alternate. I thenfound that I could excite vacuum tubes at considerable distance from a conductorconnected to a properly constructed coil, and that I could, by converting theoscillatory current of a conductor to a higher potential, establishelectrostatic alternating fields which acted through the whole extent of theroom, lighting up a tube no matter where it was held in space. I thought Irecognized that I had made a step in advance, and I have persevered in thisline; but I wish to say that I share with all lovers of science and progress theone and only desire—to reach a result of utility to men in any direction towhich thought or experiment may lead me. I think that this departure is theright one, for I cannot see, from the observation of the phenomena whichmanifest themselves as the frequency is increased, what there would remain toact between two circuits conveying, for instance, impulses of several hundredmillions per second, except electrostatic forces. Even with such triflingfrequencies the energy would be practically all potential, and my conviction hasgrown strong that, to whatever kind of motion light may be due, it is producedby tremendous electrostatic stresses vibrating with extreme rapidity.Of all these phenomena observed with currents, or electric impulses, of highfrequency, the most fascinating for an audience are certainly those which arenoted in an electrostatic field acting through considerable distance; and thebest an unskilled lecturer can do is to begin and finish with the exhibition ofthese singular effects. I take a tube in my hand and move it about, and it islighted wherever I may hold it; throughout space the invisible forces act. But Imay take another tube and it might not light, the vacuum being very high. Iexcite it by means of a disruptive discharge coil, and now it will light in theelectrostatic field. I may put it away for a few weeks or months, still itretains the faculty of being excited. What change have I produced in the tube inthe act of exciting it? If a motion imparted to atoms, it is difficult toperceive how it can persist so long without being arrested by frictional losses;and if a strain exerted in the dielectric, such as a simple electrificationwould produce, it is easy to see how it may persist indefinitely, but verydifficult to understand why such a condition should aid the excitation when wehave to deal with potentials which are rapidly alternating.Since I have exhibited these phenomena for the first time, I have obtained someother interesting effects. For instance, I have produced the incandescence of abutton, filament, or wire enclosed in a tube. To get to this result it wasnecessary to economize the energy which is obtained from the field, and directmost of it on the small body to be rendered incandescent. At the beginning thetask appeared difficult, but the experiences gathered permitted me to reach theresult easily. In Fig. 163 and Fig. 164, two such tubes are illustrated, whichare prepared for the occasion. In Fig. 163 a short tube T1, sealed to anotherlong tube T, is provided with a stem s, with a platinum wire sealed in thelatter. A very thin lamp filament l, is fastened to this wire and connection tothe outside is made through a thin copper wire w. The tube is provided withoutside and inside coatings, C and C1, respectively, and is filled as far as thecoatings reach with conducting, and the space above with insulating, powder.These coatings are merely used to enable me to perform two experiments with thetube—namely, to produce the effect desired either by direct connection of thebody of the experimenter or of another body to the wire w, or by actinginductively through the glass. The stem s is provided with an aluminum tube a,for purposes before explained, and only a small part of the filament reaches outof this tube. By holding the tube T1 anywhere in the electrostatic field, thefilament is rendered incandescent.images [images/fig163.jpg]FIG. 163.images [images/fig164.jpg]FIG. 164.A more interesting piece of apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 164. Theconstruction is the same as before, only instead of the lamp filament a smallplatinum wire p, sealed in a stem s, and bent above it in a circle, is connectedto the copper wire w, which is joined to an inside coating C. A small stem s1 isprovided with a needle, on the point of which is arranged, to rotate veryfreely, a very light fan of mica v. To prevent the fan from falling out, a thinstem of glass g, is bent properly and fastened to the aluminum tube. When theglass tube is held anywhere in the electrostatic field the platinum wire becomesincandescent, and the mica vanes are rotated very fast.Intense phosphorescence may be excited in a bulb by merely connecting it to aplate within the field, and the plate need not be any larger than an ordinarylamp shade. The phosphorescence excited with these currents is incomparably morepowerful than with ordinary apparatus. A small phosphorescent bulb, whenattached to a wire connected to a coil, emits sufficient light to allow readingordinary print at a distance of five to six paces. It was of interest to see howsome of the phosphorescent bulbs of Professor Crookes would behave with thesecurrents, and he has had the kindness to lend me a few for the occasion. Theeffects produced are magnificent, especially by the sulphide of calcium andsulphide of zinc. With the disruptive discharge coil they glow intensely merelyby holding them in the hand and connecting the body to the terminal of the coil.To whatever results investigations of this kind may lead, the chief interestlies, for the present, in the possibilities they offer for the production of anefficient illuminating device. In no branch of electric industry is an advancemore desired than in the manufacture of light. Every thinker, when consideringthe barbarous methods employed, the deplorable losses incurred in our bestsystems of light production, must have asked himself, What is likely to be thelight of the future? Is it to be an incandescent solid, as in the present lamp,or an incandescent gas, or a phosphorescent body, or something like a burner,but incomparably more efficient?There is little chance to perfect a gas burner; not, perhaps, because humaningenuity has been bent upon that problem for centuries without a radicaldeparture having been made—though the argument is not devoid of force—butbecause in a burner the highest vibrations can never be reached, except bypassing through all the low ones. For how is a flame to proceed unless by a fallof lifted weights? Such process cannot be maintained without renewal, andrenewal is repeated passing from low to high vibrations. One way only seems tobe open to improve a burner, and that is by trying to reach higher degrees ofincandescence. Higher incandescence is equivalent to a quicker vibration: thatmeans more light from the same material, and that again, means more economy. Inthis direction some improvements have been made, but the progress is hampered bymany limitations. Discarding, then, the burner, there remains the three waysfirst mentioned, which are essentially electrical.Suppose the light of the immediate future to be a solid, rendered incandescentby electricity. Would it not seem that it is better to employ a small buttonthan a frail filament? From many considerations it certainly must be concludedthat a button is capable of a higher economy, assuming, of course, thedifficulties connected with the operation of such a lamp to be effectivelyovercome. But to light such a lamp we require a high potential; and to get thiseconomically, we must use high frequencies.Such considerations apply even more to the production of light by theincandescence of a gas, or by phosphorescence. In all cases we require highfrequencies and high potentials. These thoughts occurred to me a long time ago.Incidentally we gain, by the use of high frequencies, many advantages, such ashigher economy in the light production, the possibility of working with onelead, the possibility of doing away with the leading-in wire, etc.The question is, how far can we go with frequencies? Ordinary conductors rapidlylose the facility of transmitting electric impulses when the frequency isgreatly increased. Assume the means for the production of impulses of very greatfrequency brought to the utmost perfection, everyone will naturally ask how totransmit them when the necessity arises. In transmitting such impulses throughconductors we must remember that we have to deal with pressure and flow, in theordinary interpretation of these terms. Let the pressure increase to an enormousvalue, and let the flow correspondingly diminish, then such impulses—variationsmerely of pressure, as it were—can no doubt be transmitted through a wire evenif their frequency be many hundreds of millions per second. It would, of course,be out of question to transmit such impulses through a wire immersed in agaseous medium, even if the wire were provided with a thick and excellentinsulation, for most of the energy would be lost in molecular bombardment andconsequent heating. The end of the wire connected to the source would be heated,and the remote end would receive but a trifling part of the energy supplied. Theprime necessity, then, if such electric impulses are to be used, is to findmeans to reduce as much as possible the dissipation.The first thought is, to employ the thinnest possible wire surrounded by thethickest practicable insulation. The next thought is to employ electrostaticscreens. The insulation of the wire may be covered with a thin conductingcoating and the latter connected to the ground. But this would not do, as thenall the energy would pass through the conducting coating to the ground andnothing would get to the end of the wire. If a ground connection is made it canonly be made through a conductor offering an enormous impedance, or through acondenser of extremely small capacity. This, however, does not do away withother difficulties.If the wave length of the impulses is much smaller than the length of the wire,then corresponding short waves will be set up in the conducting coating, and itwill be more or less the same as though the coating were directly connected toearth. It is therefore necessary to cut up the coating in sections much shorterthan the wave length. Such an arrangement does not still afford a perfectscreen, but it is ten thousand times better than none. I think it preferable tocut up the conducting coating in small sections, even if the current waves bemuch longer than the coating.If a wire were provided with a perfect electrostatic screen, it would be thesame as though all objects were removed from it at infinite distance. Thecapacity would then be reduced to the capacity of the wire itself, which wouldbe very small. It would then be possible to send over the wire currentvibrations of very high frequencies at enormous distances, without affectinggreatly the character of the vibrations. A perfect screen is of course out ofthe question, but I believe that with a screen such as I have just describedtelephony could be rendered practicable across the Atlantic. According to myideas, the gutta-percha covered wire should be provided with a third conductingcoating subdivided in sections. On the top of this should be again placed alayer of guttapercha and other insulation, and on the top of the whole thearmor. But such cables will not be constructed, for ere longintelligence—transmitted without wires—will throb through the earth like a pulsethrough a living organism. The wonder is that, with the present state ofknowledge and the experiences gained, no attempt is being made to disturb theelectrostatic or magnetic condition of the earth, and transmit, if nothing else,intelligence.It has been my chief aim in presenting these results to point out phenomena orfeatures of novelty, and to advance ideas which I am hopeful will serve asstarting points of new departures. It has been my chief desire this evening toentertain you with some novel experiments. Your applause, so frequently andgenerously accorded, has told me that I have succeeded.In conclusion, let me thank you most heartily for your kindness and attention,and assure you that the honor I have had in addressing such a distinguishedaudience, the pleasure I have had in presenting these results to a gathering ofso many able men—and among them also some of those in whose work for many yearspast I have found enlightenment and constant pleasure—I shall never forget.______________________* Lecture delivered before the Institution of Electrical Engineers, London,February, 1892."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXVIII [05_Contents.xhtml#r31]ON LIGHT AND OTHER HIGH FREQUENCY PHENOMENA [05_Contents.xhtml#r31]*INTRODUCTORY—SOME THOUGHTS ON THE EYEWhen we look at the world around us, on Nature, we are impressed with its beautyand grandeur. Each thing we perceive, though it may be vanishingly small, is initself a world, that is, like the whole of the universe, matter and forcegoverned by law—a world, the contemplation of which fills us with feelings ofwonder and irresistibly urges us to ceaseless thought and inquiry. But in allthis vast world, of all objects our senses reveal to us, the most marvellous,the most appealing to our imagination, appears no doubt a highly developedorganism, a thinking being. If there is anything fitted to make us admireNature’s handiwork, it is certainly this inconceivable structure, which performsits innumerable motions of obedience to external influence. To understand itsworkings, to get a deeper insight into this Nature’s masterpiece, has ever beenfor thinkers a fascinating aim, and after many centuries of arduous research menhave arrived at a fair understanding of the functions of its organs and senses.Again, in all the perfect harmony of its parts, of the parts which constitutethe material or tangible of our being, of all its organs and senses, the eye isthe most wonderful. It is the most precious, the most indispensable of ourperceptive or directive organs, it is the great gateway through which allknowledge enters the mind. Of all our organs, it is the one, which is in themost intimate relation with that which we call intellect. So intimate is thisrelation, that it is often said, the very soul shows itself in the eye.It can be taken as a fact, which the theory of the action of the eye implies,that for each external impression, that is, for each image produced upon theretina, the ends of the visual nerves, concerned in the conveyance of theimpression to the mind, must be under a peculiar stress or in a vibratory state.It now does not seem improbable that, when by the power of thought an image isevoked, a distinct reflex action, no matter how weak, is exerted upon certainends of the visual nerves, and therefore upon the retina. Will it ever be withinhuman power to analyze the condition of the retina when disturbed by thought orreflex action, by the help of some optical or other means of such sensitiveness,that a clear idea of its state might be gained at any time? If this werepossible, then the problem of reading one’s thoughts with precision, like thecharacters of an open book, might be much easier to solve than many problemsbelonging to the domain of positive physical science, in the solution of whichmany, if not the majority, of scientific men implicitly believe. Helmholtz, hasshown that the fundi of the eye are themselves, luminous, and he was able tosee, in total darkness, the movement of his arm by the light of his own eyes.This is one of the most remarkable experiments recorded in the history ofscience, and probably only a few men could satisfactorily repeat it, for it isvery likely, that the luminosity of the eyes is associated with uncommonactivity of the brain and great imaginative power. It is fluorescence of brainaction, as it were.Another fact having a bearing on this subject which has probably been noted bymany, since it is stated in popular expressions, but which I cannot recollect tohave found chronicled as a positive result of observation is, that at times,when a sudden idea or image presents itself to the intellect, there is adistinct and sometimes painful sensation of luminosity produced in the eye,observable even in broad daylight.The saying then, that the soul shows itself in the eye, is deeply founded, andwe feel that it expresses a great truth. It has a profound meaning even for onewho, like a poet or artist, only following his inborn instinct or love forNature, finds delight in aimless thoughts and in the mere contemplation ofnatural phenomena, but a still more profound meaning for one who, in the spiritof positive scientific investigation, seeks to ascertain the causes of theeffects. It is principally the natural philosopher, the physicist, for whom theeye is the subject of the most intense admiration.Two facts about the eye must forcibly impress the mind of the physicist,notwithstanding he may think or say that it is an imperfect optical instrument,forgetting, that the very conception of that which is perfect or seems so tohim, has been gained through this same instrument. First, the eye is, as far asour positive knowledge goes, the only organ which is directly affected by thatsubtile medium, which as science teaches us, must fill all space; secondly, itis the most sensitive of our organs, incomparably more sensitive to externalimpressions than any other.The organ of hearing implies the impact of ponderable bodies, the organ of smellthe transference of detached material particles, and the organs of taste, and oftouch or force, the direct contact, or at least some interference of ponderablematter, and this is true even in those instances of animal organisms, in whichsome of these organs are developed to a degree of truly marvelous perfection.This being so, it seems wonderful that the organ of sight solely should becapable of being stirred by that, which all our other organs are powerless todetect, yet which plays an essential part in all natural phenomena, whichtransmits all energy and sustains all motion and, that most intricate of all,life, but which has properties such that even a scientifically trained mindcannot help drawing a distinction between it and all that is called matter.Considering merely this, and the fact that the eye, by its marvelous power,widens our otherwise very narrow range of perception far beyond the limits ofthe small world which is our own, to embrace myriads of other worlds, suns andstars in the infinite depths of the universe, would make it justifiable toassert, that it is an organ of a higher order. Its performances are beyondcomprehension. Nature as far as we know never produced anything more wonderful.We can get barely a faint idea of its prodigious power by analyzing what it doesand by comparing. When ether waves impinge upon the human body, they produce thesensations of warmth or cold, pleasure or pain, or perhaps other sensations ofwhich we are not aware, and any degree or intensity of these sensations, whichdegrees are infinite in number, hence an infinite number of distinct sensations.But our sense of touch, or our sense of force, cannot reveal to us thesedifferences in degree or intensity, unless they are very great. Now we canreadily conceive how an organism, such as the human, in the eternal process ofevolution, or more philosophically speaking, adaptation to Nature, beingconstrained to the use of only the sense of touch or force, for instance, mightdevelop this sense to such a degree of sensitiveness or perfection, that itwould be capable of distinguishing the minutest differences in the temperatureof a body even at some distance, to a hundredth, or thousandth, or millionthpart of a degree. Yet, even this apparently impossible performance would notbegin to compare with that of the eye, which is capable of distinguishing andconveying to the mind in a single instant innumerable peculiarities of the body,be it in form, or color, or other respects. This power of the eye rests upon twothings, namely, the rectilinear propagation of the disturbance by which it iseffected, and upon its sensitiveness. To say that the eye is sensitive is notsaying anything. Compared with it, all other organs are monstrously crude. Theorgan of smell which guides a dog on the trail of a deer, the organ of touch orforce which guides an insect in its wanderings, the organ of hearing, which isaffected by the slightest disturbances of the air, are sensitive organs, to besure, but what are they compared with the human eye! No doubt it responds to thefaintest echoes or reverberations of the medium; no doubt, it brings us tidingsfrom other worlds, infinitely remote, but in a language we cannot as yet alwaysunderstand. And why not? Because we live in a medium filled with air and othergases, vapors and a dense mass of solid particles flying about. These play animportant part in many phenomena; they fritter away the energy of the vibrationsbefore they can reach the eye; they too, are the carriers of germs ofdestruction, they get into our lungs and other organs, clog up the channels andimperceptibly, yet inevitably, arrest the stream of life. Could we but do awaywith all ponderable matter in the line of sight of the telescope, it wouldreveal to us undreamt of marvels. Even the unaided eye, I think, would becapable of distinguishing in the pure medium, small objects at distancesmeasured probably by hundreds or perhaps thousands of miles.But there is something else about the eye which impresses us still more thanthese wonderful features which we observed, viewing it from the standpoint of aphysicist, merely as an optical instrument—something which appeals to us morethan its marvelous faculty of being directly affected by the vibrations of themedium, without interference of gross matter, and more than its inconceivablesensitiveness and discerning power. It is its significance in the processes oflife. No matter what one’s views on nature and life may be, he must stand amazedwhen, for the first time in his thoughts, he realizes the importance of the eyein the physical processes and mental performances of the human organism. And howcould it be otherwise, when he realizes, that the eye is the means through whichthe human race has acquired the entire knowledge it possesses, that it controlsall our motions, more still, all our actions.There is no way of acquiring knowledge except through the eye. What is thefoundation of all philosophical systems of ancient and modern times, in fact, ofall the philosophy of man? I am, I think; I think, therefore I am. But how couldI think and how would I know that I exist, if I had not the eye? For knowledgeinvolves consciousness; consciousness involves ideas, conceptions; conceptionsinvolve pictures or images, and images the sense of vision, and therefore theorgan of sight. But how about blind men, will be asked? Yes, a blind man maydepict in magnificent poems, forms and scenes from real life, from a world hephysically does not see. A blind man may touch the keys of an instrument withunerring precision, may model the fastest boat, may discover and invent,calculate and construct, may do still greater wonders—but all the blind men whohave done such things have descended from those who had seeing eyes. Nature mayreach the same result in many ways. Like a wave in the physical world, in theinfinite ocean of the medium which pervades all, so in the world of organisms,in life, an impulse started proceeds onward, at times, may be, with the speed oflight, at times, again, so slowly that for ages and ages it seems to stay,passing through processes of a complexity inconceivable to men, but in all itsforms, in all its stages, its energy ever and ever integrally present. A singleray of light from a distant star falling upon the eye of a tyrant in bygonetimes, may have altered the course of his life, may have changed the destiny ofnations, may have transformed the surface of the globe, so intricate, soinconceivably complex are the processes in Nature. In no way can we get such anoverwhelming idea of the grandeur of Nature, as when we consider, that inaccordance with the law of the conservation of energy, throughout the infinite,the forces are in a perfect balance, and hence the energy of a single thoughtmay determine the motion of a Universe. It is not necessary that everyindividual, not even that every generation or many generations, should have thephysical instrument of sight, in order to be able to form images and to think,that is, form ideas or conceptions; but sometime or other, during the process ofevolution, the eye certainly must have existed, else thought, as we understandit, would be impossible; else conceptions, like spirit, intellect, mind, call itas you may, could not exist. It is conceivable, that in some other world, insome other beings, the eye is replaced by a different organ, equally or moreperfect, but these beings cannot be men.Now what prompts us all to voluntary motions and actions of any kind? Again theeye. If I am conscious of the motion, I must have an idea or conception, thatis, an image, therefore the eye. If I am not precisely conscious of the motion,it is, because the images are vague or indistinct, being blurred by thesuperimposition of many. But when I perform the motion, does the impulse whichprompts me to the action come from within or from without? The greatestphysicists have not disdained to endeavor to answer this and similar questionsand have at times abandoned themselves to the delights of pure and unrestrainedthought. Such questions are generally considered not to belong to the realm ofpositive physical science, but will before long be annexed to its domain.Helmholtz has probably thought more on life than any modern scientist. LordKelvin expressed his belief that life’s process is electrical and that there isa force inherent to the organism and determining its motions. Just as much as Iam convinced of any physical truth I am convinced that the motive impulse mustcome from the outside. For, consider the lowest organism we know—and there areprobably many lower ones—an aggregation of a few cells only. If it is capable ofvoluntary motion it can perform an infinite number of motions, all definite andprecise. But now a mechanism consisting of a finite number of parts and few atthat, cannot perform an infinite number of definite motions, hence the impulseswhich govern its movements must come from the environment. So, the atom, theulterior element of the Universe’s structure, is tossed about in space,eternally, a play to external influences, like a boat in a troubled sea. Were itto stop its motion it would die. Matter at rest, if such a thing could exist,would be matter dead. Death of matter! Never has a sentence of deeperphilosophical meaning been uttered. This is the way in which Prof. Dewarforcibly expresses it in the description of his admirable experiments, in whichliquid oxygen is handled as one handles water, and air at ordinary pressure ismade to condense and even to solidify by the intense cold. Experiments, whichserve to illustrate, in his language, the last feeble manifestations of life,the last quiverings of matter about to die. But human eyes shall not witnesssuch death. There is no death of matter, for throughout the infinite universe,all has to move, to vibrate, that is, to live.I have made the preceding statements at the peril of treading upon metaphysicalground, in my desire to introduce the subject of this lecture in a manner notaltogether uninteresting, I may hope, to an audience such as I have the honor toaddress. But now, then, returning to the subject, this divine organ of sight,this indispensable instrument for thought and all intellectual enjoyment, whichlays open to us the marvels of this universe, through which we have acquiredwhat knowledge we possess, and which prompts us to, and controls, all ourphysical and mental activity. By what is it affected? By light! What is light?We have witnessed the great strides which have been made in all departments ofscience in recent years. So great have been the advances that we cannot refrainfrom asking ourselves, Is this all true, or is it but a dream? Centuries ago menhave lived, have thought, discovered, invented, and have believed that they weresoaring, while they were merely proceeding at a snail’s pace. So we too may bemistaken. But taking the truth of the observed events as one of the impliedfacts of science, we must rejoice in the immense progress already made and stillmore in the anticipation of what must come, judging from the possibilitiesopened up by modern research. There is, however, an advance which we have beenwitnessing, which must be particularly gratifying to every lover of progress. Itis not a discovery, or an invention, or an achievement in any particulardirection. It is an advance in all directions of scientific thought andexperiment. I mean the generalization of the natural forces and phenomena, thelooming up of a certain broad idea on the scientific horizon. It is this ideawhich has, however, long ago taken possession of the most advanced minds, towhich I desire to call your attention, and which I intend to illustrate in ageneral way, in these experiments, as the first step in answering the question“What is light?” and to realize the modern meaning of this word.It is beyond the scope of my lecture to dwell upon the subject of light ingeneral, my object being merely to bring presently to your notice a certainclass of light effects and a number of phenomena observed in pursuing the studyof these effects. But to be consistent in my remarks it is necessary to statethat, according to that idea, now accepted by the majority of scientific men asa positive result of theoretical and experimental investigation, the variousforms or manifestations of energy which were generally designated as “electric”or more precisely “electromagnetic” are energy manifestations of the same natureas those of radiant heat and light. Therefore the phenomena of light and heatand others besides these, may be called electrical phenomena. Thus electricalscience has become the mother science of all and its study has become allimportant. The day when we shall know exactly what “electricity” is, willchronicle an event probably greater, more important than any other recorded inthe history of the human race. The time will come when the comfort, the veryexistence, perhaps, of man will depend upon that wonderful agent. For ourexistence and comfort we require heat, light and mechanical power. How do we nowget all these? We get them from fuel, we get them by consuming material. Whatwill man do when the forests disappear, when the coal fields are exhausted? Onlyone thing, according to our present knowledge will remain; that is, to transmitpower at great distances. Men will go to the waterfalls, to the tides, which arethe stores of an infinitesimal part of Nature’s immeasurable energy. There willthey harness the energy and transmit the same to their settlements, to warmtheir homes by, to give them light, and to keep their obedient slaves, themachines, toiling. But how will they transmit this energy if not by electricity?Judge then, if the comfort, nay, the very existence, of man will not depend onelectricity. I am aware that this view is not that of a practical engineer, butneither is it that of an illusionist, for it is certain, that powertransmission, which at present is merely a stimulus to enterprise, will some daybe a dire necessity.It is more important for the student, who takes up the study of light phenomena,to make himself thoroughly acquainted with certain modern views, than to peruseentire books on the subject of light itself, as disconnected from these views.Were I therefore to make these demonstrations before students seekinginformation—and for the sake of the few of those who may be present, give meleave to so assume—it would be my principal endeavor to impress these views upontheir minds in this series of experiments.It might be sufficient for this purpose to perform a simple and well-knownexperiment. I might take a familiar appliance, a Leyden jar, charge it from africtional machine, and then discharge it. In explaining to you its permanentstate when charged, and its transitory condition when discharging, calling yourattention to the forces which enter into play and to the various phenomena theyproduce, and pointing out the relation of the forces and phenomena, I mightfully succeed in illustrating that modern idea. No doubt, to the thinker, thissimple experiment would appeal as much as the most magnificent display. But thisis to be an experimental demonstration, and one which should possess, besidesinstructive, also entertaining features and as such, a simple experiment, suchas the one cited, would not go very far towards the attainment of the lecturer’saim. I must therefore choose another way of illustrating, more spectacularcertainly, but perhaps also more instructive. Instead of the frictional machineand Leyden jar, I shall avail myself in these experiments, of an induction coilof peculiar properties, which was described in detail by me in a lecture beforethe London Institution of Electrical Engineers, in Feb., 1892. This inductioncoil is capable of yielding currents of enormous potential differences,alternating with extreme rapidity. With this apparatus I shall endeavor to showyou three distinct classes of effects, or phenomena, and it is my desire thateach experiment, while serving for the purposes of illustration, should at thesame time teach us some novel truth, or show us some novel aspect of thisfascinating science. But before doing this, it seems proper and useful to dwellupon the apparatus employed, and method of obtaining the high potentials andhigh-frequency currents which are made use of in these experiments.ON THE APPARATUS AND METHOD OF CONVERSIONThese high-frequency currents are obtained in a peculiar manner. The methodemployed was advanced by me about two years ago in an experimental lecturebefore the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. A number of ways, aspracticed in the laboratory, of obtaining these currents either from continuousor low frequency alternating currents, is diagramatically indicated in Fig. 165,which will be later described in detail. The general plan is to chargecondensers, from a direct or alternate-current source, preferably ofhigh-tension, and to discharge them disruptively while observing well-knownconditions necessary to maintain the oscillations of the current. In view of thegeneral interest taken in high-frequency currents and effects producible bythem, it seems to me advisable to dwell at some length upon this method ofconversion. In order to give you a clear idea of the action, I will suppose thata continuous-current generator is employed, which is often very convenient. Itis desirable that the generator should possess such high tension as to be ableto break through a small air space. If this is not the case, then auxiliarymeans have to be resorted to, some of which will be indicated subsequently. Whenthe condensers are charged to a certain potential, the air, or insulating space,gives way and a disruptive discharge occurs. There is then a sudden rush ofcurrent and generally a large portion of accumulated electrical energy spendsitself. The condensers are thereupon quickly charged and the same process isrepeated in more or less rapid succession. To produce such sudden rushes ofcurrent it is necessary to observe certain conditions. If the rate at which thecondensers are discharged is the same as that at which they are charged, then,clearly, in the assumed case the condensers do not come into play. If the rateof discharge be smaller than the rate of charging, then, again, the condenserscannot play an important part. But if, on the contrary, the rate of dischargingis greater than that of charging, then a succession of rushes of current isobtained. It is evident that, if the rate at which the energy is dissipated bythe discharge is very much greater than the rate of supply to the condensers,the sudden rushes will be comparatively few, with long-time intervals between.This always occurs when a condenser of considerable capacity is charged by meansof a comparatively small machine. If the rates of supply and dissipation are notwidely different, then the rushes of current will be in quicker succession, andthis the more, the more nearly equal both the rates are, until limitationsincident to each case and depending upon a number of causes are reached. Thus weare able to obtain from a continuous-current generator as rapid a succession ofdischarges as we like. Of course, the higher the tension of the generator, thesmaller need be the capacity of the condensers, and for this reason,principally, it is of advantage to employ a generator of very high tension.Besides, such a generator permits the attaining of greater rates of vibration.images [images/fig165.jpg]FIG. 165.The rushes of current may be of the same direction under the conditions beforeassumed, but most generally there is an oscillation superimposed upon thefundamental vibration of the current. When the conditions are so determined thatthere are no oscillations, the current impulses are unidirectional and thus ameans is provided of transforming a continuous current of high tension, into adirect current of lower tension, which I think may find employment in the arts.This method of conversion is exceedingly interesting and I was much impressed byits beauty when I first conceived it. It is ideal in certain respects. Itinvolves the employment of no mechanical devices of any kind, and it allows ofobtaining currents of any desired frequency from an ordinary circuit, direct oralternating. The frequency of the fundamental discharges depending on therelative rates of supply and dissipation can be readily varied within widelimits, by simple adjustments of these quantities, and the frequency of thesuperimposed vibration by the determination of the capacity, self-induction andresistance of the circuit. The potential of the currents, again, may be raisedas high as any insulation is capable of withstanding safely by combiningcapacity and self-induction or by induction in a secondary, which need have butcomparatively few turns.As the conditions are often such that the intermittence or oscillation does notreadily establish itself, especially when a direct current source is employed,it is of advantage to associate an interrupter with the arc, as I have, sometime ago, indicated the use of an air-blast or magnet, or other such devicereadily at hand. The magnet is employed with special advantage in the conversionof direct currents, as it is then very effective. If the primary source is analternate current generator, it is desirable, as I have stated on anotheroccasion, that the frequency should be low, and that the current forming the arcbe large, in order to render the magnet more effective.A form of such discharger with a magnet which has been found convenient, andadopted after some trials, in the conversion of direct currents particularly, isillustrated in Fig. 166. N S are the pole pieces of a very strong magnet whichis excited by a coil C. The pole pieces are slotted for adjustment and can befastened in any position by screws s s1. The discharge rods d d1, thinned downon the ends in order to allow a closer approach of the magnetic pole pieces,pass through the columns of brass b b1 and are fastened in position by screws s2s2. Springs r r1 and collars c c1 are slipped on the rods, the latter serving toset the points of the rods at a certain suitable distance by means of screws s3s3, and the former to draw the points apart. When it is desired to start thearc, one of the large rubber handles h h1 is tapped quickly with the hand,whereby the points of the rods are brought in contact but are instantlyseparated by the springs r r1. Such an arrangement has been found to be oftennecessary, namely in cases when the E. M. F. was not large enough to cause thedischarge to break through the gap, and also when it was desirable to avoidshort circuiting of the generator by the metallic contact of the rods. Therapidity of the interruptions of the current with a magnet depends on theintensity of the magnetic field and on the potential difference at the end ofthe arc. The interruptions are generally in such quick succession as to producea musical sound. Years ago it was observed that when a powerful induction coilis discharged between the poles of a strong magnet, the discharge produces aloud noise, not unlike a small pistol shot. It was vaguely stated that the sparkwas intensified by the presence of the magnetic field. It is now clear that thedischarge current, flowing for some time, was interrupted a great number oftimes by the magnet, thus producing the sound. The phenomenon is especiallymarked when the field circuit of a large magnet or dynamo is broken in apowerful magnetic field.images [images/fig166.jpg]FIG. 166.When the current through the gap is comparatively large, it is of advantage toslip on the points of the discharge rods pieces of very hard carbon and let thearc play between the carbon pieces. This preserves the rods, and besides has theadvantage of keeping the air space hotter, as the heat is not conducted away asquickly through the carbons, and the result is that a smaller E. M. F. in thearc gap is required to maintain a succession of discharges.Another form of discharger, which may be employed with advantage in some cases,is illustrated in Fig. 167. In this form the discharge rods d d1 pass throughperforations in a wooden box B, which is thickly coated with mica on the inside,as indicated by the heavy lines. The perforations are provided with mica tubes mm1 of some thickness, which are preferably not in contact with the rods d d1.The box has a cover C which is a little larger and descends on the outside ofthe box. The spark gap is warmed by a small lamp l contained in the box. A platep above the lamp allows the draught to pass only through the chimney e of thelamp, the air entering through holes o o in or near the bottom of the box andfollowing the path indicated by the arrows. When the discharger is in operation,the door of the box is closed so that the light of the arc is not visibleoutside. It is desirable to exclude the light as perfectly as possible, as itinterferes with some experiments. This form of discharger is simple and veryeffective when properly manipulated. The air being warmed to a certaintemperature, has its insulating power impaired; it becomes dielectrically weak,as it were, and the consequence is that the arc can be established at muchgreater distance. The arc should, of course, be sufficiently insulating to allowthe discharge to pass through the gap disruptively. The arc formed under suchconditions, when long, may be made extremely sensitive, and the weak draughtthrough the lamp chimney c is quite sufficient to produce rapid interruptions.The adjustment is made by regulating the temperature and velocity of thedraught. Instead of using the lamp, it answers the purpose to provide for adraught of warm air in other ways. A very simple way which has been practiced isto enclose the arc in a long vertical tube, with plates on the top and bottomfor regulating the temperature and velocity of the air current. Some provisionhad to be made for deadening the sound.images [images/fig167.jpg]FIG. 167.The air may be rendered dielectrically weak also by rarefaction. Dischargers ofthis kind have likewise been used by me in connection with a magnet. A largetube is for this purpose provided with heavy electrodes of carbon or metal,between which the discharge is made to pass, the tube being placed in a powerfulmagnetic field. The exhaustion of the tube is carried to a point at which thedischarge breaks through easily, but the pressure should be more than 75millimeters, at which the ordinary thread discharge occurs. In another form ofdischarger, combining the features before mentioned, the discharge was made topass between two adjustable magnetic pole pieces, the space between them beingkept at an elevated temperature.It should be remarked here that when such, or interrupting devices of any kind,are used and the currents are passed through the primary of a disruptivedischarge coil, it is not, as a rule, of advantage to produce a number ofinterruptions of the current per second greater than the natural frequency ofvibration of the dynamo supply circuit, which is ordinarily small. It shouldalso be pointed out here, that while the devices mentioned in connection withthe disruptive discharge are advantageous under certain conditions, they may besometimes a source of trouble, as they produce intermittences and otherirregularities in the vibration which it would be very desirable to overcome.There is, I regret to say, in this beautiful method of conversion a defect,which fortunately is not vital, and which I have been gradually overcoming. Iwill best call attention to this defect and indicate a fruitful line of work, bycomparing the electrical process with its mechanical analogue. The process maybe illustrated in this manner. Imagine a tank with a wide opening at the bottom,which is kept closed by spring pressure, but so that it snaps off suddenly whenthe liquid in the tank has reached a certain height. Let the fluid be suppliedto the tank by means of a pipe feeding at a certain rate. When the criticalheight of the liquid is reached, the spring gives way and the bottom of the tankdrops out. Instantly the liquid falls through the wide opening, and the spring,reasserting itself, closes the bottom again. The tank is now filled, and after acertain time interval the same process is repeated. It is clear, that if thepipe feeds the fluid quicker than the bottom outlet is capable of letting itpass through, the bottom will remain off and the tank will still overflow. Ifthe rates of supply are exactly equal, then the bottom lid will remain partiallyopen and no vibration of the same and of the liquid column will generally occur,though it might, if started by some means. But if the inlet pipe does not feedthe fluid fast enough for the outlet, then there will be always vibration.Again, in such case, each time the bottom flaps up or down, the spring and theliquid column, if the pliability of the spring and the inertia of the movingparts are properly chosen, will perform independent vibrations. In this analoguethe fluid may be likened to electricity or electrical energy, the tank to thecondenser, the spring to the dielectric, and the pipe to the conductor throughwhich electricity is supplied to the condenser. To make this analogy quitecomplete it is necessary to make the assumption, that the bottom, each time itgives way, is knocked violently against a non-elastic stop, this impactinvolving some loss of energy; and that, besides, some dissipation of energyresults due to frictional losses. In the preceding analogue the liquid issupposed to be under a steady pressure. If the presence of the fluid be assumedto vary rhythmically, this may be taken as corresponding to the case of analternating current. The process is then not quite as simple to consider, butthe action is the same in principle.It is desirable, in order to maintain the vibration economically, to reduce theimpact and frictional losses as much as possible. As regards the latter, whichin the electrical analogue correspond to the losses due to the resistance of thecircuits, it is impossible to obviate them entirely, but they can be reduced toa minimum by a proper selection of the dimensions of the circuits and by theemployment of thin conductors in the form of strands. But the loss of energycaused by the first breaking through of the dielectric—which in the aboveexample corresponds to the violent knock of the bottom against the inelasticstop—would be more important to overcome. At the moment of the breaking through,the air space has a very high resistance, which is probably reduced to a verysmall value when the current has reached some strength, and the space is broughtto a high temperature. It would materially diminish the loss of energy if thespace were always kept at an extremely high temperature, but then there would beno disruptive break. By warming the space moderately by means of a lamp orotherwise, the economy as far as the arc is concerned is sensibly increased. Butthe magnet or other interrupting device does not diminish the loss in the arc.Likewise, a jet of air only facilitates the carrying off of the energy. Air, ora gas in general, behaves curiously in this respect. When two bodies charged toa very high potential, discharge disruptively through an air space, any amountof energy may be carried off by the air. This energy is evidently dissipated bybodily carriers, in impact and collisional losses of the molecules. The exchangeof the molecules in the space occurs with inconceivable rapidity. A powerfuldischarge taking place between two electrodes, they may remain entirely cool,and yet the loss in the air may represent any amount of energy. It is perfectlypracticable, with very great potential differences in the gap, to dissipateseveral horse-power in the arc of the discharge without even noticing a smallincrease in the temperature of the electrodes. All the frictional losses occurthen practically in the air. If the exchange of the air molecules is prevented,as by enclosing the air hermetically, the gas inside of the vessel is broughtquickly to a high temperature, even with a very small discharge. It is difficultto estimate how much of the energy is lost in sound waves, audible or not, in apowerful discharge. When the currents through the gap are large, the electrodesmay become rapidly heated, but this is not a reliable measure of the energywasted in the arc, as the loss through the gap itself may be comparativelysmall. The air or a gas in general is, at ordinary pressure at least, clearlynot the best medium through which a disruptive discharge should occur. Air orother gas under great pressure is of course a much more suitable medium for thedischarge gap. I have carried on long-continued experiments in this direction,unfortunately less practicable on account of the difficulties and expense ingetting air under great pressure. But even if the medium in the discharge spaceis solid or liquid, still the same losses take place, though they are generallysmaller, for just as soon as the arc is established, the solid or liquid isvolatilized. Indeed, there is no body known which would not be disintegrated bythe arc, and it is an open question among scientific men, whether an arcdischarge could occur at all in the air itself without the particles of theelectrodes being torn off. When the current through the gap is very small andthe arc very long, I believe that a relatively considerable amount of heat istaken up in the disintegration of the electrodes, which partially on thisaccount may remain quite cold.The ideal medium for a discharge gap should only crack, and the ideal electrodeshould be of some material which cannot be disintegrated. With small currentsthrough the gap it is best to employ aluminum, but not when the currents arelarge. The disruptive break in the air, or more or less in any ordinary medium,is not of the nature of a crack, but it is rather comparable to the piercing ofinnumerable bullets through a mass offering great frictional resistances to themotion of the bullets, this involving considerable loss of energy. A mediumwhich would merely crack when strained electrostatically—and this possibly mightbe the case with a perfect vacuum, that is, pure ether—would involve a verysmall loss in the gap, so small as to be entirely negligible, at leasttheoretically, because a crack may be produced by an infinitely smalldisplacement. In exhausting an oblong bulb provided with two aluminum terminals,with the greatest care, I have succeeded in producing such a vacuum that thesecondary discharge of a disruptive discharge coil would break disruptivelythrough the bulb in the form of fine spark streams. The curious point was thatthe discharge would completely ignore the terminals and start far behind the twoaluminum plates which served as electrodes. This extraordinary high vacuum couldonly be maintained for a very short while. To return to the ideal medium, think,for the sake of illustration, of a piece of glass or similar body clamped in avice, and the latter tightened more and more. At a certain point a minuteincrease of the pressure will cause the glass to crack. The loss of energyinvolved in splitting the glass may be practically nothing, for though the forceis great, the displacement need be but extremely small. Now imagine that theglass would possess the property of closing again perfectly the crack upon aminute diminution of the pressure. This is the way the dielectric in thedischarge space should behave. But inasmuch as there would be always some lossin the gap, the medium, which should be continuous, should exchange through thegap at a rapid rate. In the preceding example, the glass being perfectly closed,it would mean that the dielectric in the discharge space possesses a greatinsulating power; the glass being cracked, it would signify that the medium inthe space is a good conductor. The dielectric should vary enormously inresistance by minute variations of the E. M. F. across the discharge space. Thiscondition is attained, but in an extremely imperfect manner, by warming the airspace to a certain critical temperature, dependent on the E. M. F. across thegap, or by otherwise impairing the insulating power of the air. But as a matterof fact the air does never break down disruptively, if this term be rigorouslyinterpreted, for before the sudden rush of the current occurs, there is always aweak current preceding it, which rises first gradually and then with comparativesuddenness. That is the reason why the rate of change is very much greater whenglass, for instance, is broken through, than when the break takes place throughan air space of equivalent dielectric strength. As a medium for the dischargespace, a solid, or even a liquid, would be preferable therefor. It is somewhatdifficult to conceive of a solid body which would possess the property ofclosing instantly after it has been cracked. But a liquid, especially undergreat pressure, behaves practically like a solid, while it possesses theproperty of closing the crack. Hence it was thought that a liquid insulatormight be more suitable as a dielectric than air. Following out this idea, anumber of different forms of dischargers in which a variety of such insulators,sometimes under great pressure, were employed, have been experimented upon. Itis thought sufficient to dwell in a few words upon one of the forms experimentedupon. One of these dischargers is illustrated in Figs. 168a and 168b.images [images/fig168a.jpg]FIG. 168a.images [images/fig168b.jpg]FIG. 168b.A hollow metal pulley P (Fig. 168a), was fastened upon an arbor a, which bysuitable means was rotated at a considerable speed. On the inside of the pulley,but disconnected from the same, was supported a thin disc h (which is shownthick for the sake of clearness), of hard rubber in which there were embeddedtwo metal segments s s with metallic extensions e e into which were screwedconducting terminals t t covered with thick tubes of hard rubber t1 t1. Therubber disc h with its metallic segments s s, was finished in a lathe, and itsentire surface highly polished so as to offer the smallest possible frictionalresistance to the motion through a fluid. In the hollow of the pulley aninsulating liquid such as a thin oil was poured so as to reach very nearly tothe opening left in the flange f, which was screwed tightly on the front side ofthe pulley. The terminals t t, were connected to the opposite coatings of abattery of condensers so that the discharge occurred through the liquid. Whenthe pulley was rotated, the liquid was forced against the rim of the pulley andconsiderable fluid pressure resulted. In this simple way the discharge gap wasfilled with a medium which behaved practically like a solid, which possessed thequality of closing instantly upon the occurrence of the break, and whichmoreover was circulating through the gap at a rapid rate. Very powerful effectswere produced by discharges of this kind with liquid interrupters, of which anumber of different forms were made. It was found that, as expected, a longerspark for a given length of wire was obtainable in this way than by using air asan interrupting device. Generally the speed, and therefore also the fluidpressure, was limited by reason of the fluid friction, in the form of dischargerdescribed, but the practically obtainable speed was more than sufficient toproduce a number of breaks suitable for the circuits ordinarily used. In suchinstances the metal pulley P was provided with a few projections inwardly, and adefinite number of breaks was then produced which could be computed from thespeed of rotation of the pulley. Experiments were also carried on with liquidsof different insulating power with the view of reducing the loss in the arc.When an insulating liquid is moderately warmed, the loss in the arc isdiminished.A point of some importance was noted in experiments with various discharges ofthis kind. It was found, for instance, that whereas the conditions maintained inthese forms were favorable for the production of a great spark length, thecurrent so obtained was not best suited to the production of light effects.Experience undoubtedly has shown, that for such purposes a harmonic rise andfall of the potential is preferable. Be it that a solid is renderedincandescent, or phosphorescent, or be it that energy is transmitted bycondenser coating through the glass, it is quite certain that a harmonicallyrising and falling potential produces less destructive action, and that thevacuum is more permanently maintained. This would be easily explained if it wereascertained that the process going on in an exhausted vessel is of anelectrolytic nature.In the diagrammatical sketch, Fig. 165, which has been already referred to, thecases which are most likely to be met with in practice are illustrated. One hasat his disposal either direct or alternating currents from a supply station. Itis convenient for an experimenter in an isolated laboratory to employ a machineG, such as illustrated, capable of giving both kinds of currents. In such caseit is also preferable to use a machine with multiple circuits, as in manyexperiments it is useful and convenient to have at one’s disposal currents ofdifferent phases. In the sketch, D represents the direct and A the alternatingcircuit. In each of these, three branch circuits are shown, all of which areprovided with double line switches s s s s s s. Consider first the directcurrent conversion; Ia represents the simplest case. If the E. M. F. of thegenerator is sufficient to break through a small air space, at least when thelatter is warmed or otherwise rendered poorly insulating, there is no difficultyin maintaining a vibration with fair economy by judicious adjustment of thecapacity, self-induction and resistance of the circuit L containing the devicesl l m. The magnet N, S, can be in this case advantageously combined with the airspace. The discharger d d with the magnet may be placed either way, as indicatedby the full or by the dotted lines. The circuit Ia with the connections anddevices is supposed to possess dimensions such as are suitable for themaintenance of a vibration. But usually the E. M. F. on the circuit or branch Iawill be something like a 100 volts or so, and in this case it is not sufficientto break through the gap. Many different means may be used to remedy this byraising the E. M. F. across the gap. The simplest is probably to insert a largeself-induction coil in series with the circuit L. When the arc is established,as by the discharger illustrated in Fig. 166, the magnet blows the arc out theinstant it is formed. Now the extra current of the break, being of high E. M.F., breaks through the gap, and a path of low resistance for the dynamo currentbeing again provided, there is a sudden rush of current from the dynamo upon theweakening or subsidence of the extra current. This process is repeated in rapidsuccession, and in this manner I have maintained oscillation with as low as 50volts, or even less, across the gap. But conversion on this plan is not to berecommended on account of the too heavy currents through the gap and consequentheating of the electrodes; besides, the frequencies obtained in this way arelow, owing to the high self-induction necessarily associated with the circuit.It is very desirable to have the E. M. F. as high as possible, first, in orderto increase the economy of the conversion, and, secondly, to obtain highfrequencies. The difference of potential in this electric oscillation is, ofcourse, the equivalent of the stretching force in the mechanical vibration ofthe spring. To obtain very rapid vibration in a circuit of some inertia, a greatstretching force or difference of potential is necessary. Incidentally, when theE. M. F. is very great, the condenser which is usually employed in connectionwith the circuit need but have a small capacity, and many other advantages aregained. With a view of raising the E. M. F. to a many times greater value thanobtainable from ordinary distribution circuits, a rotating transformer g isused, as indicated at IIa, Fig. 165, or else a separate high potential machineis driven by means of a motor operated from the generator G. The latter plan isin fact preferable, as changes are easier made. The connections from the hightension winding are quite similar to those in branch Ia with the exception thata condenser C, which should be adjustable, is connected to the high tensioncircuit. Usually, also, an adjustable self-induction coil in series with thecircuit has been employed in these experiments. When the tension of the currentsis very high, the magnet ordinarily used in connection with the discharger is ofcomparatively small value, as it is quite easy to adjust the dimensions of thecircuit so that oscillation is maintained. The employment of a steady E. M. F.in the high frequency conversion affords some advantages over the employment ofalternating E. M. F., as the adjustments are much simpler and the action can beeasier controlled. But unfortunately one is limited by the obtainable potentialdifference. The winding also breaks down easily in consequence of the sparkswhich form between the sections of the armature or commutator when a vigorousoscillation takes place. Besides, these transformers are expensive to build. Ithas been found by experience that it is best to follow the plan illustrated atIIIa. In this arrangement a rotating transformer g, is employed to convert thelow tension direct currents into low frequency alternating currents, preferablyalso of small tension. The tension of the currents is then raised in astationary transformer T. The secondary S of this transformer is connected to anadjustable condenser C which discharges through the gap or discharger d d,placed in either of the ways indicated, through the primary P of a disruptivedischarge coil, the high frequency current being obtained from the secondary Sof this coil, as described on previous occasions. This will undoubtedly be foundthe cheapest and most convenient way of converting direct currents.The three branches of the circuit A represent the usual cases met in practicewhen alternating currents are converted. In Fig. 1b a condenser C, generally oflarge capacity, is connected to the circuit L containing the devices l l, m m.The devices m m are supposed to be of high self-induction so as to bring thefrequency of the circuit more or less to that of the dynamo. In this instancethe discharger d d should best have a number of makes and breaks per secondequal to twice the frequency of the dynamo. If not so, then it should have atleast a number equal to a multiple or even fraction of the dynamo frequency. Itshould be observed, referring to Ib, that the conversion to a high potential isalso effected when the discharger d d, which is shown in the sketch, is omitted.But the effects which are produced by currents which rise instantly to highvalues, as in a disruptive discharge, are entirely different from those producedby dynamo currents which rise and fall harmonically. So, for instance, theremight be in a given case a number of makes and breaks at d d equal to just twicethe frequency of the dynamo, or in other words, there may be the same number offundamental oscillations as would be produced without the discharge gap, andthere might even not be any quicker superimposed vibration; yet the differencesof potential at the various points of the circuit, the impedance and otherphenomena, dependent upon the rate of change, will bear no similarity in the twocases. Thus, when working with currents discharging disruptively, the elementchiefly to be considered is not the frequency, as a student might be apt tobelieve, but the rate of change per unit of time. With low frequencies in acertain measure the same effects may be obtained as with high frequencies,provided the rate of change is sufficiently great. So if a low frequency currentis raised to a potential of, say, 75,000 volts, and the high tension currentpassed through a series of high resistance lamp filaments, the importance of therarefied gas surrounding the filament is clearly noted, as will be seen later;or, if a low frequency current of several thousand amperes is passed through ametal bar, striking phenomena of impedance are observed, just as with currentsof high frequencies. But it is, of course, evident that with low frequencycurrents it is impossible to obtain such rates of change per unit of time aswith high frequencies, hence the effects produced by the latter are much moreprominent. It is deemed advisable to make the preceding remarks, inasmuch asmany more recently described effects have been unwittingly identified with highfrequencies. Frequency alone in reality does not mean anything, except when anundisturbed harmonic oscillation is considered.In the branch IIIb a similar disposition to that in Ib is illustrated, with thedifference that the currents discharging through the gap d d are used to inducecurrents in the secondary S of a transformer T. In such case the secondaryshould be provided with an adjustable condenser for the purpose of tuning it tothe primary.IIb illustrates a plan of alternate current high frequency conversion which ismost frequently used and which is found to be most convenient. This plan hasbeen dwelt upon in detail on previous occasions and need not be described here.Some of these results were obtained by the use of a high frequency alternator. Adescription of such machines will be found in my original paper before theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers, and in periodicals of that period,notably in The Electrical Engineer of March 18, 1891.I will now proceed with the experiments.ON PHENOMENA PRODUCED BY ELECTROSTATIC FORCEThe first class of effects I intend to show you are effects produced byelectrostatic force. It is the force which governs the motion of the atoms,which causes them to collide and develop the life-sustaining energy of heat andlight, and which causes them to aggregate in an infinite variety of ways,according to Nature’s fanciful designs, and to form all these wondrousstructures we perceive around us; it is, in fact, if our present views be true,the most important force for us to consider in Nature. As the term electrostaticmight imply a steady electric condition, it should be remarked, that in theseexperiments the force is not constant, but varies at a rate which may beconsidered moderate, about one million times a second, or thereabouts. Thisenables me to produce many effects which are not producible with an unvaryingforce.When two conducting bodies are insulated and electrified, we say that anelectrostatic force is acting between them. This force manifests itself inattractions, repulsions and stresses in the bodies and space or medium without.So great may be the strain exerted in the air, or whatever separates the twoconducting bodies, that it may break down, and we observe sparks or bundles oflight or streamers, as they are called. These streamers form abundantly when theforce through the air is rapidly varying. I will illustrate this action ofelectrostatic force in a novel experiment in which I will employ the inductioncoil before referred to. The coil is contained in a trough filled with oil, andplaced under the table. The two ends of the secondary wire pass through the twothick columns of hard rubber which protrude to some height above the table. Itis necessary to insulate the ends or terminals of the secondary heavily withhard rubber, because even dry wood is by far too poor an insulator for thesecurrents of enormous potential differences. On one of the terminals of the coil,I have placed a large sphere of sheet brass, which is connected to a largerinsulated brass plate, in order to enable me to perform the experiments underconditions, which, as you will see, are more suitable for this experiment. I nowset the coil to work and approach the free terminal with a metallic object heldin my hand, this simply to avoid burns. As I approach the metallic object to adistance of eight or ten inches, a torrent of furious sparks breaks forth fromthe end of the secondary wire, which passes through the rubber column. Thesparks cease when the metal in my hand touches the wire. My arm is now traversedby a powerful electric current, vibrating at about the rate of one million timesa second. All around me the electrostatic force makes itself felt, and the airmolecules and particles of dust flying about are acted upon and are hammeringviolently against my body. So great is this agitation of the particles, thatwhen the lights are turned out you may see streams of feeble light appear onsome parts of my body. When such a streamer breaks out on any part of the body,it produces a sensation like the pricking of a needle. Were the potentialssufficiently high and the frequency of the vibration rather low, the skin wouldprobably be ruptured under the tremendous strain, and the blood would rush outwith great force in the form of fine spray or jet so thin as to be invisible,just as oil will when placed on the positive terminal of a Holtz machine. Thebreaking through of the skin though it may seem impossible at first, wouldperhaps occur, by reason of the tissues under the skin being incomparably betterconducting. This, at least, appears plausible, judging from some observations.I can make these streams of light visible to all, by touching with the metallicobject one of the terminals as before, and approaching my free hand to the brasssphere, which is connected to the second terminal of the coil. As the hand isapproached, the air between it and the sphere, or in the immediate neighborhood,is more violently agitated, and you see streams of light now break forth from myfinger tips and from the whole hand (Fig. 169). Were I to approach the handcloser, powerful sparks would jump from the brass sphere to my hand, which mightbe injurious. The streamers offer no particular inconvenience, except that inthe ends of the finger tips a burning sensation is felt. They should not beconfounded with those produced by an influence machine, because in many respectsthey behave differently. I have attached the brass sphere and plate to one ofthe terminals in order to prevent the formation of visible streamers on thatterminal, also in order to prevent sparks from jumping at a considerabledistance. Besides, the attachment is favorable for the working of the coil.images [images/fig169.jpg]FIG. 169.The streams of light which you have observed issuing from my hand are due to apotential of about 200,000 volts, alternating in rather irregular intervals,sometimes like a million times a second. A vibration of the same amplitude, butfour times as fast, to maintain which over 3,000,000 volts would be required,would be more than sufficient to envelop my body in a complete sheet of flame.But this flame would not burn me up; quite contrarily, the probability is that Iwould not be injured in the least. Yet a hundredth part of that energy,otherwise directed, would be amply sufficient to kill a person.The amount of energy which may thus be passed into the body of a person dependson the frequency and potential of the currents, and by making both of these verygreat, a vast amount of energy may be passed into the body without causing anydiscomfort, except perhaps, in the arm, which is traversed by a true conductioncurrent. The reason why no pain in the body is felt, and no injurious effectnoted, is that everywhere, if a current be imagined to flow through the body,the direction of its flow would be at right angles to the surface; hence thebody of the experimenter offers an enormous section to the current, and thedensity is very small, with the exception of the arm, perhaps, where the densitymay be considerable. But if only a small fraction of that energy would beapplied in such a way that a current would traverse the body in the same manneras a low frequency current, a shock would be received which might be fatal. Adirect or low frequency alternating current is fatal, I think, principallybecause its distribution through the body is not uniform, as it must divideitself in minute streamlets of great density, whereby some organs are vitallyinjured. That such a process occurs I have not the least doubt, though noevidence might apparently exist, or be found upon examination. The surest toinjure and destroy life, is a continuous current, but the most painful is analternating current of very low frequency. The expression of these views, whichare the result of long continued experiment and observation, both with steadyand varying currents, is elicited by the interest which is at present taken inthis subject, and by the manifestly erroneous ideas which are daily propoundedin journals on this subject.I may illustrate an effect of the electrostatic force by another strikingexperiment, but before, I must call your attention to one or two facts. I havesaid before, that when the medium between two oppositely electrified bodies isstrained beyond a certain limit it gives way and, stated in popular language,the opposite electric charges unite and neutralize each other. This breakingdown of the medium occurs principally when the force acting between the bodiesis steady, or varies at a moderate rate. Were the variation sufficiently rapid,such a destructive break would not occur, no matter how great the force, for allthe energy would be spent in radiation, convection and mechanical and chemicalaction. Thus the spark length, or greatest distance which a spark will jumpbetween the electrified bodies is the smaller, the greater the variation or timerate of change. But this rule may be taken to be true only in a general way,when comparing rates which are widely different.I will show you by an experiment the difference in the effect produced by arapidly varying and a steady or moderately varying force. I have here two largecircular brass plates p p (Fig. 170a and Fig. 170b), supported on movableinsulating stands on the table, connected to the ends of the secondary of a coilsimilar to the one used before. I place the plates ten or twelve inches apartand set the coil to work. You see the whole space between the plates, nearly twocubic feet, filled with uniform light, Fig. 170a. This light is due to thestreamers you have seen in the first experiment, which are now much moreintense. I have already pointed out the importance of these streamers incommercial apparatus and their still greater importance in some purelyscientific investigations. Often they are too weak to be visible, but theyalways exist, consuming energy and modifying the action of the apparatus. Whenintense, as they are at present, they produce ozone in great quantity, and also,as Professor Crookes has pointed out, nitrous acid. So quick is the chemicalaction that if a coil, such as this one, is worked for a very long time it willmake the atmosphere of a small room unbearable, for the eyes and throat areattacked. But when moderately produced, the streamers refresh the atmospherewonderfully, like a thunder-storm, and exercises unquestionably a beneficialeffect.images [images/fig170.jpg]FIG. 170a, FIG. 170b.In this experiment the force acting between the plates changes in intensity anddirection at a very rapid rate. I will now make the rate of change per unit timemuch smaller. This I effect by rendering the discharges through the primary ofthe induction coil less frequent, and also by diminishing the rapidity of thevibration in the secondary. The former result is conveniently secured bylowering the E. M. F. over the air gap in the primary circuit, the latter byapproaching the two brass plates to a distance of about three or four inches.When the coil is set to work, you see no streamers or light between the plates,yet the medium between them is under a tremendous strain. I still furtheraugment the strain by raising the E. M. F. in the primary circuit, and soon yousee the air give way and the hall is illuminated by a shower of brilliant andnoisy sparks, Fig. 170b. These sparks could be produced also with unvaryingforce; they have been for many years a familiar phenomenon, though they wereusually obtained from an entirely different apparatus. In describing these twophenomena so radically different in appearance, I have advisedly spoken of a“force” acting between the plates. It would be in accordance with accepted viewsto say, that there was an “alternating E. M. F.” acting between the plates. Thisterm is quite proper and applicable in all cases where there is evidence of atleast a possibility of an essential inter-dependence of the electric state ofthe plates, or electric action in their neighborhood. But if the plates wereremoved to an infinite distance, or if at a finite distance, there is noprobability or necessity whatever for such dependence. I prefer to use the term“electrostatic force,” and to say that such a force is acting around each plateor electrified insulated body in general. There is an inconvenience in usingthis expression as the term incidentally means a steady electric condition; buta proper nomenclature will eventually settle this difficulty.I now return to the experiment to which I have already alluded, and with which Idesire to illustrate a striking effect produced by a rapidly varyingelectrostatic force. I attach to the end of the wire, l (Fig. 171), which is inconnection with one of the terminals of the secondary of the induction coil, anexhausted bulb b. This bulb contains a thin carbon filament f, which is fastenedto a platinum wire w, sealed in the glass and leading outside of the bulb, whereit connects to the wire l. The bulb may be exhausted to any degree attainablewith ordinary apparatus. Just a moment before, you have witnessed the breakingdown of the air between the charged brass plates. You know that a plate ofglass, or any other insulating material, would break down in like manner. Had Itherefore a metallic coating attached to the outside of the bulb, or placed nearthe same, and were this coating connected to the other terminal of the coil, youwould be prepared to see the glass give way if the strain were sufficientlyincreased. Even were the coating not connected to the other terminal, but to aninsulated plate, still, if you have followed recent developments, you wouldnaturally expect a rupture of the glass.images [images/fig171.jpg]FIG. 171.But it will certainly surprise you to note that under the action of the varyingelectrostatic force, the glass gives way when all other bodies are removed fromthe bulb. In fact, all the surrounding bodies we perceive might be removed to aninfinite distance without affecting the result in the slightest. When the coilis set to work, the glass is invariably broken through at the seal, or othernarrow channel, and the vacuum is quickly impaired. Such a damaging break wouldnot occur with a steady force, even if the same were many times greater. Thebreak is due to the agitation of the molecules of the gas within the bulb, andoutside of the same. This agitation, which is generally most violent in thenarrow pointed channel near the seal, causes a heating and rupture of the glass.This rupture, would, however, not occur, not even with a varying force, if themedium filling the inside of the bulb, and that surrounding it, were perfectlyhomogeneous. The break occurs much quicker if the top of the bulb is drawn outinto a fine fibre. In bulbs used with these coils such narrow, pointed channelsmust therefore be avoided.When a conducting body is immersed in air, or similar insulating medium,consisting of, or containing, small freely movable particles capable of beingelectrified, and when the electrification of the body is made to undergo a veryrapid change—which is equivalent to saying that the electrostatic force actingaround the body is varying in intensity—the small particles are attracted andrepelled, and their violent impacts against the body may cause a mechanicalmotion of the latter. Phenomena of this kind are noteworthy, inasmuch as theyhave not been observed before with apparatus such as has been commonly in use.If a very light conducting sphere be suspended on an exceedingly fine wire, andcharged to a steady potential, however high, the sphere will remain at rest.Even if the potential would be rapidly varying, provided that the smallparticles of matter, molecules or atoms, are evenly distributed, no motion ofthe sphere should result. But if one side of the conducting sphere is coveredwith a thick insulating layer, the impacts of the particles will cause thesphere to move about, generally in irregular curves, Fig. 172a. In like manner,as I have shown on a previous occasion, a fan of sheet metal, Fig. 172b, coveredpartially with insulating material as indicated, and placed upon the terminal ofthe coil so as to turn freely on it, is spun around.images [images/fig172a.jpg]FIG. 172a.images [images/fig172b.jpg]FIG. 172b.All these phenomena you have witnessed and others which will be shown later, aredue to the presence of a medium like air, and would not occur in a continuousmedium. The action of the air may be illustrated still better by the followingexperiment. I take a glass tube t, Fig. 173, of about an inch in diameter, whichhas a platinum wire w sealed in the lower end, and to which is attached a thinlamp filament f. I connect the wire with the terminal of the coil and set thecoil to work. The platinum wire is now electrified positively and negatively inrapid succession and the wire and air inside of the tube is rapidly heated bythe impacts of the particles, which may be so violent as to render the filamentincandescent. But if I pour oil in the tube, just as soon as the wire is coveredwith the oil, all action apparently ceases and there is no marked evidence ofheating. The reason of this is that the oil is a practically continuous medium.The displacements in such a continuous medium are, with these frequencies, toall appearance incomparably smaller than in air, hence the work performed insuch a medium is insignificant. But oil would behave very differently withfrequencies many times as great, for even though the displacements be small, ifthe frequency were much greater, considerable work might be performed in theoil.images [images/fig173.jpg]FIG. 173.The electrostatic attractions and repulsions between bodies of measurabledimensions are, of all the manifestations of this force, the first so-calledelectrical phenomena noted. But though they have been known to us for manycenturies, the precise nature of the mechanism concerned in these actions isstill unknown to us, and has not been even quite satisfactorily explained. Whatkind of mechanism must that be? We cannot help wondering when we observe twomagnets attracting and repelling each other with a force of hundreds of poundswith apparently nothing between them. We have in our commercial dynamos magnetscapable of sustaining in mid-air tons of weight. But what are even these forcesacting between magnets when compared with the tremendous attractions andrepulsions produced by electrostatic force, to which there is apparently nolimit as to intensity. In lightning discharges bodies are often charged to sohigh a potential that they are thrown away with inconceivable force and tornasunder or shattered into fragments. Still even such effects cannot compare withthe attractions and repulsions which exist between charged molecules or atoms,and which are sufficient to project them with speeds of many kilometers asecond, so that under their violent impact bodies are rendered highlyincandescent and are volatilized. It is of special interest for the thinker whoinquires into the nature of these forces to note that whereas the actionsbetween individual molecules or atoms occur seemingly under any conditions, theattractions and repulsions of bodies of measurable dimensions imply a mediumpossessing insulating properties. So, if air, either by being rarefied orheated, is rendered more or less conducting, these actions between twoelectrified bodies practically cease, while the actions between the individualatoms continue to manifest themselves.An experiment may serve as an illustration and as a means of bringing out otherfeatures of interest. Some time ago I showed that a lamp filament or wiremounted in a bulb and connected to one of the terminals of a high tensionsecondary coil is set spinning, the top of the filament generally describing acircle. This vibration was very energetic when the air in the bulb was atordinary pressure and became less energetic when the air in the bulb wasstrongly compressed. It ceased altogether when the air was exhausted so as tobecome comparatively good conducting. I found at that time that no vibrationtook place when the bulb was very highly exhausted. But I conjectured that thevibration which I ascribed to the electrostatic action between the walls of thebulb and the filament should take place also in a highly exhausted bulb. To testthis under conditions which were more favorable, a bulb like the one in Fig.174, was constructed. It comprised a globe b, in the neck of which was sealed aplatinum wire w carrying a thin lamp filament f. In the lower part of the globea tube t was sealed so as to surround the filament. The exhaustion was carriedas far as it was practicable with the apparatus employed.images [images/fig174.jpg]FIG. 174.This bulb verified my expectation, for the filament was set spinning when thecurrent was turned on, and became incandescent. It also showed anotherinteresting feature, bearing upon the preceding remarks, namely, when thefilament had been kept incandescent some time, the narrow tube and the spaceinside were brought to an elevated temperature, and as the gas in the tube thenbecame conducting, the electrostatic attraction between the glass and thefilament became very weak or ceased, and the filament came to rest. When it cameto rest it would glow far more intensely. This was probably due to its assumingthe position in the center of the tube where the molecular bombardment was mostintense, and also partly to the fact that the individual impacts were moreviolent and that no part of the supplied energy was converted into mechanicalmovement. Since, in accordance with accepted views, in this experiment theincandescence must be attributed to the impacts of the particles, molecules oratoms in the heated space, these particles must therefore, in order to explainsuch action, be assumed to behave as independent carriers of electric chargesimmersed in an insulating medium; yet there is no attractive force between theglass tube and the filament because the space in the tube is, as a whole,conducting.It is of some interest to observe in this connection that whereas the attractionbetween two electrified bodies may cease owing to the impairing of theinsulating power of the medium in which they are immersed, the repulsion betweenthe bodies may still be observed. This may be explained in a plausible way. Whenthe bodies are placed at some distance in a poorly conducting medium, such asslightly warmed or rarefied air, and are suddenly electrified, opposite electriccharges being imparted to them, these charges equalize more or less by leakagethrough the air. But if the bodies are similarly electrified, there is lessopportunity afforded for such dissipation, hence the repulsion observed in suchcase is greater than the attraction. Repulsive actions in a gaseous medium arehowever, as Prof. Crookes has shown, enhanced by molecular bombardment.ON CURRENT OR DYNAMIC ELECTRICITY PHENOMENASo far, I have considered principally effects produced by a varyingelectrostatic force in an insulating medium, such as air. When such a force isacting upon a conducting body of measurable dimensions, it causes within thesame, or on its surface, displacements of the electricity and gives rise toelectric currents, and these produce another kind of phenomena, some of which Ishall presently endeavor to illustrate. In presenting this second class ofelectrical effects, I will avail myself principally of such as are produciblewithout any return circuit, hoping to interest you the more by presenting thesephenomena in a more or less novel aspect.It has been a long time customary, owing to the limited experience withvibratory currents, to consider an electric current as something circulating ina closed conducting path. It was astonishing at first to realize that a currentmay flow through the conducting path even if the latter be interrupted, and itwas still more surprising to learn, that sometimes it may be even easier to makea current flow under such conditions than through a closed path. But that oldidea is gradually disappearing, even among practical men, and will soon beentirely forgotten.If I connect an insulated metal plate P, Fig. 175, to one of the terminals T ofthe induction coil by means of a wire, though this plate be very well insulated,a current passes through the wire when the coil is set to work. First I wish togive you evidence that there is a current passing through the connecting wire.An obvious way of demonstrating this is to insert between the terminal of thecoil and the insulated plate a very thin platinum or german silver wire w andbring the latter to incandescence or fusion by the current. This requires arather large plate or else current impulses of very high potential andfrequency. Another way is to take a coil C, Fig. 175, containing many turns ofthin insulated wire and to insert the same in the path of the current to theplate. When I connect one of the ends of the coil to the wire leading to anotherinsulated plate P1, and its other end to the terminal T1 of the induction coil,and set the latter to work, a current passes through the inserted coil C and theexistence of the current may be made manifest in various ways. For instance, Iinsert an iron core i within the coil. The current being one of very highfrequency, will, if it be of some strength, soon bring the iron core to anoticeably higher temperature, as the hysteresis and current losses are greatwith such high frequencies. One might take a core of some size, laminated ornot, it would matter little; but ordinary iron wire images[images/img_p137.jpg]th or ⅛th of an inch thick is suitable for the purpose.While the induction coil is working, a current traverses the inserted coil andonly a few moments are sufficient to bring the iron wire i to an elevatedtemperature sufficient to soften the sealing-wax s, and cause a paper washer pfastened by it to the iron wire to fall off. But with the apparatus such as Ihave here, other, much more interesting, demonstrations of this kind can bemade. I have a secondary S, Fig 176, of coarse wire, wound upon a coil similarto the first. In the preceding experiment the current through the coil C, Fig.175, was very small, but there being many turns a strong heating effect was,nevertheless, produced in the iron wire. Had I passed that current through aconductor in order to show the heating of the latter, the current might havebeen too small to produce the effect desired. But with this coil provided with asecondary winding, I can now transform the feeble current of high tension whichpasses through the primary P into a strong secondary current of low tension, andthis current will quite certainly do what I expect. In a small glass tube (t,Fig. 176), I have enclosed a coiled platinum wire, w, this merely in order toprotect the wire. On each end of the glass tube is sealed a terminal of stoutwire to which one of the ends of the platinum wire w, is connected. I join theterminals of the secondary coil to these terminals and insert the primary p,between the insulated plate P1 and the terminal T1, of the induction coil asbefore. The latter being set to work, instantly the platinum wire w is renderedincandescent and can be fused, even if it be very thick.images [images/fig175.jpg]FIG. 175.images [images/fig176.jpg]FIG. 176.Instead of the platinum wire I now take an ordinary 50-volt 16 c. p. lamp. WhenI set the induction coil in operation the lamp filament is brought to highincandescence. It is, however, not necessary to use the insulated plate, for thelamp (l, Fig. 177) is rendered incandescent even if the plate P1 bedisconnected. The secondary may also be connected to the primary as indicated bythe dotted line in Fig. 177, to do away more or less with the electrostaticinduction or to modify the action otherwise.images [images/fig177.jpg]FIG. 177.I may here call attention to a number of interesting observations with the lamp.First, I disconnect one of the terminals of the lamp from the secondary S. Whenthe induction coil plays, a glow is noted which fills the whole bulb. This glowis due to electrostatic induction. It increases when the bulb is grasped withthe hand, and the capacity of the experimenter’s body thus added to thesecondary circuit. The secondary, in effect, is equivalent to a metalliccoating, which would be placed near the primary. If the secondary, or itsequivalent, the coating, were placed symmetrically to the primary, theelectrostatic induction would be nil under ordinary conditions, that is, when aprimary return circuit is used, as both halves would neutralize each other. Thesecondary is in fact placed symmetrically to the primary, but the action of bothhalves of the latter, when only one of its ends is connected to the inductioncoil, is not exactly equal; hence electrostatic induction takes place, and hencethe glow in the bulb. I can nearly equalize the action of both halves of theprimary by connecting the other, free end of the same to the insulated plate, asin the preceding experiment. When the plate is connected, the glow disappears.With a smaller plate it would not entirely disappear and then it wouldcontribute to the brightness of the filament when the secondary is closed, bywarming the air in the bulb.To demonstrate another interesting feature, I have adjusted the coils used in acertain way. I first connect both the terminals of the lamp to the secondary,one end of the primary being connected to the terminal T1 of the induction coiland the other to the insulated plate P1 as before. When the current is turnedon, the lamp glows brightly, as shown in Fig. 178b, in which C is a fine wirecoil and S a coarse wire secondary wound upon it. If the insulated plate P1 isdisconnected, leaving one of the ends a of the primary insulated, the filamentbecomes dark or generally it diminishes in brightness (Fig. 178a). Connectingagain the plate P1 and raising the frequency of the current, I make the filamentquite dark or barely red (Fig. 179b). Once more I will disconnect the plate. Onewill of course infer that when the plate is disconnected, the current throughthe primary will be weakened, that therefore the E. M. F. will fall in thesecondary S, and that the brightness of the lamp will diminish. This might bethe case and the result can be secured by an easy adjustment of the coils; alsoby varying the frequency and potential of the currents. But it is perhaps ofgreater interest to note, that the lamp increases in brightness when the plateis disconnected (Fig. 179a). In this case all the energy the primary receives isnow sunk into it, like the charge of a battery in an ocean cable, but most ofthat energy is recovered through the secondary and used to light the lamp. Thecurrent traversing the primary is strongest at the end b which is connected tothe terminal T1 of the induction coil, and diminishes in strength towards theremote end a. But the dynamic inductive effect exerted upon the secondary S isnow greater than before, when the suspended plate was connected to the primary.These results might have been produced by a number of causes. For instance, theplate P1 being connected, the reaction from the coil C may be such as todiminish the potential at the terminal T1 of the induction coil, and thereforeweaken the current through the primary of the coil C. Or the disconnecting ofthe plate may diminish the capacity effect with relation to the primary of thelatter coil to such an extent that the current through it is diminished, thoughthe potential at the terminal T1 of the induction coil may be the same or evenhigher. Or the result might have been produced by the change of phase of theprimary and secondary currents and consequent reaction. But the chiefdetermining factor is the relation of the self-induction and capacity of coil Cand plate P1 and the frequency of the currents. The greater brightness of thefilament in Fig. 179a, is, however, in part due to the heating of the rarefiedgas in the lamp by electrostatic induction, which, as before remarked, isgreater when the suspended plate is disconnected.images [images/fig178a.jpg]FIG. 178a.images [images/fig178b.jpg]FIG. 178b.images [images/fig179a.jpg]FIG. 179a.images [images/fig179b.jpg]FIG. 179b.Still another feature of some interest I may here bring to your attention. Whenthe insulated plate is disconnected and the secondary of the coil opened, byapproaching a small object to the secondary, but very small sparks can be drawnfrom it, showing that the electrostatic induction is small in this case. Butupon the secondary being closed upon itself or through the lamp, the filamentglowing brightly, strong sparks are obtained from the secondary. Theelectrostatic induction is now much greater, because the closed secondarydetermines a greater flow of current through the primary and principally throughthat half of it which is connected to the induction coil. If now the bulb begrasped with the hand, the capacity of the secondary with reference to theprimary is augmented by the experimenter’s body and the luminosity of thefilament is increased, the incandescence now being due partly to the flow ofcurrent through the filament and partly to the molecular bombardment of therarefied gas in the bulb.The preceding experiments will have prepared one for the next following resultsof interest, obtained in the course of these investigations. Since I can pass acurrent through an insulated wire merely by connecting one of its ends to thesource of electrical energy, since I can induce by it another current, magnetizean iron core, and, in short, perform all operations as though a return circuitwere used, clearly I can also drive a motor by the aid of only one wire. On aformer occasion I have described a simple form of motor comprising a singleexciting coil, an iron core and disc. Fig. 180 illustrates a modified way ofoperating such an alternate current motor by currents induced in a transformerconnected to one lead, and several other arrangements of circuits for operatinga certain class of alternating motors founded on the action of currents ofdiffering phase. In view of the present state of the art it is thoughtsufficient to describe these arrangements in a few words only. The diagram, Fig.180 II, shows a primary coil P, connected with one of its ends to the line Lleading from a high tension transformer terminal T1. In inductive relation tothis primary P is a secondary S of coarse wire in the circuit of which is a coilc. The currents induced in the secondary energize the iron core i, which ispreferably, but not necessarily, subdivided, and set the metal disc d inrotation. Such a motor M2 as diagramatically shown in Fig. 180 II, has beencalled a “magnetic lag motor,” but this expression may be objected to by thosewho attribute the rotation of the disc to eddy currents circulating in minutepaths when the core i is finally subdivided. In order to operate such a motoreffectively on the plan indicated, the frequencies should not be too high, notmore than four or five thousand, though the rotation is produced even with tenthousand per second, or more.images [images/fig180.jpg]FIG. 180.In Fig. 180 I, a motor M1 having two energizing circuits, A and B, isdiagrammatically indicated. The circuit A is connected to the line L and inseries with it is a primary P, which may have its free end connected to aninsulated plate P1, such connection being indicated by the dotted lines. Theother motor circuit B is connected to the secondary S which is in inductiverelation to the primary P. When the transformer terminal T1 is alternatelyelectrified, currents traverse the open line L and also circuit A and primary P.The currents through the latter induce secondary currents in the circuit S,which pass through the energizing coil B of the motor. The currents through thesecondary S and those through the primary P differ in phase 90 degrees, ornearly so, and are capable of rotating an armature placed in inductive relationto the circuits A and B.In Fig. 180 III, a similar motor M3 with two energizing circuits A1 and B1 isillustrated. A primary P, connected with one of its ends to the line L has asecondary S, which is preferably wound for a tolerably high E. M. F., and towhich the two energizing circuits of the motor are connected, one directly tothe ends of the secondary and the other through a condenser C, by the action ofwhich the currents traversing the circuit A1 and B1 are made to differ in phase.In Fig. 180 IV, still another arrangement is shown. In this case two primariesP1 and P2 are connected to the line L, one through a condenser C of smallcapacity, and the other directly. The primaries are provided with secondaries S1and S2 which are in series with the energizing circuits, A2 and B2 and a motorM3, the condenser C again serving to produce the requisite difference in thephase of the currents traversing the motor circuits. As such phase motors withtwo or more circuits are now well known in the art, they have been hereillustrated diagrammatically. No difficulty whatever is found in operating amotor in the manner indicated, or in similar ways; and although such experimentsup to this day present only scientific interest, they may at a period not fardistant, be carried out with practical objects in view.It is thought useful to devote here a few remarks to the subject of operatingdevices of all kinds by means of only one leading wire. It is quite obvious,that when high-frequency currents are made use of, ground connections are—atleast when the E. M. F. of the currents is great—better than a return wire. Suchground connections are objectionable with steady or low frequency currents onaccount of destructive chemical actions of the former and disturbing influencesexerted by both on the neighboring circuits; but with high frequencies theseactions practically do not exist. Still, even ground connections becomesuperfluous when the E. M. F. is very high, for soon a condition is reached,when the current may be passed more economically through open, than throughclosed, conductors. Remote as might seem an industrial application of suchsingle wire transmission of energy to one not experienced in such lines ofexperiment, it will not seem so to anyone who for some time has carried oninvestigations of such nature. Indeed I cannot see why such a plan should not bepracticable. Nor should it be thought that for carrying out such a plan currentsof very high frequency are expressly required, for just as soon as potentials ofsay 30,000 volts are used, the single wire transmission may be effected with lowfrequencies, and experiments have been made by me from which these inferencesare made.When the frequencies are very high it has been found in laboratory practicequite easy to regulate the effects in the manner shown in diagram Fig. 181. Heretwo primaries P and P1 are shown, each connected with one of its ends to theline L and with the other end to the condenser plates C and C, respectively.Near these are placed other condenser plates C1 and C1, the former beingconnected to the line L and the latter to an insulated larger plate P2. On theprimaries are wound secondaries S and S1, of coarse wire, connected to thedevices d and l respectively. By varying the distances of the condenser plates Cand C1, and C and C1 the currents through the secondaries S and S1 are varied inintensity. The curious feature is the great sensitiveness, the slightest changein the distance of the plates producing considerable variations in the intensityor strength of the currents. The sensitiveness may be rendered extreme by makingthe frequency such, that the primary itself, without any plate attached to itsfree end, satisfies, in conjunction with the closed secondary, the condition ofresonance. In such condition an extremely small change in the capacity of thefree terminal produces great variations. For instance, I have been able toadjust the conditions so that the mere approach of a person to the coil producesa considerable change in the brightness of the lamps attached to the secondary.Such observations and experiments possess, of course, at present, chieflyscientific interest, but they may soon become of practical importance.images [images/fig181.jpg]FIG. 181.Very high frequencies are of course not practicable with motors on account ofthe necessity of employing iron cores. But one may use sudden discharges of lowfrequency and thus obtain certain advantages of high-frequency currents withoutrendering the iron core entirely incapable of following the changes and withoutentailing a very great expenditure of energy in the core. I have found it quitepracticable to operate with such low frequency disruptive discharges ofcondensers, alternating-current motors. A certain class of such motors which Iadvanced a few years ago, which contain closed secondary circuits, will rotatequite vigorously when the discharges are directed through the exciting coils.One reason that such a motor operates so well with these discharges is that thedifference of phase between the primary and secondary currents is 90 degrees,which is generally not the case with harmonically rising and falling currents oflow frequency. It might not be without interest to show an experiment with asimple motor of this kind, inasmuch as it is commonly thought that disruptivedischarges are unsuitable for such purposes. The motor is illustrated in Fig.182. It comprises a rather large iron core i with slots on the top into whichare embedded thick copper washers c c. In proximity to the core is afreely-movable metal disc D. The core is provided with a primary exciting coilC1 the ends a and b of which are connected to the terminals of the secondary Sof an ordinary transformer, the primary P of the latter being connected to analternating distribution circuit or generator G of low or moderate frequency.The terminals of the secondary S are attached to a condenser C which dischargesthrough an air gap d d which may be placed in series or shunt to the coil C1.When the conditions are properly chosen the disc D rotates with considerableeffort and the iron core i does not get very perceptibly hot. With currents froma high-frequency alternator, on the contrary, the core gets rapidly hot and thedisc rotates with a much smaller effort. To perform the experiment properly itshould be first ascertained that the disc D is not set in rotation when thedischarge is not occurring at d d. It is preferable to use a large iron core anda condenser of large capacity so as to bring the superimposed quickeroscillation to a very low pitch or to do away with it entirely. By observingcertain elementary rules I have also found it practicable to operate ordinaryseries or shunt direct-current motors with such disruptive discharges, and thiscan be done with or without a return wire.images [images/fig182.jpg]FIG. 182.IMPEDANCE PHENOMENAAmong the various current phenomena observed, perhaps the most interesting arethose of impedance presented by conductors to currents varying at a rapid rate.In my first paper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, I havedescribed a few striking observations of this kind. Thus I showed that when suchcurrents or sudden discharges are passed through a thick metal bar there may bepoints on the bar only a few inches apart, which have a sufficient potentialdifference between them to maintain at bright incandescence an ordinary filamentlamp. I have also described the curious behavior of rarefied gas surrounding aconductor, due to such sudden rushes of current. These phenomena have since beenmore carefully studied and one or two novel experiments of this kind are deemedof sufficient interest to be described here.Referring to Fig. 183a, B and B1 are very stout copper bars connected at theirlower ends to plates C and C1, respectively, of a condenser, the opposite platesof the latter being connected to the terminals of the secondary S of ahigh-tension transformer, the primary P of which is supplied with alternatingcurrents from an ordinary low-frequency dynamo G or distribution circuit. Thecondenser discharges through an adjustable gap d d as usual. By establishing arapid vibration it was found quite easy to perform the following curiousexperiment. The bars B and B1 were joined at the top by a low-voltage lamp l3; alittle lower was placed by means of clamps c c, a 50-volt lamp l2; and stilllower another 100-volt lamp l1; and finally, at a certain distance below thelatter lamp, an exhausted tube T. By carefully determining the positions ofthese devices it was found practicable to maintain them all at their properilluminating power. Yet they were all connected in multiple arc to the two stoutcopper bars and required widely different pressures. This experiment requires ofcourse some time for adjustment but is quite easily performed.images [images/fig183.jpg]FIGS. 183a, 183b and 183c.In Figs. 183b and 183c, two other experiments are illustrated which, unlike theprevious experiment, do not require very careful adjustments. In Fig. 183b, twolamps, l1 and l2, the former a 100-volt and the latter a 50-volt are placed incertain positions as indicated, the 100-volt lamp being below the 50-volt lamp.When the arc is playing at d d and the sudden discharges are passed through thebars B B1, the 50-volt lamp will, as a rule, burn brightly, or at least thisresult is easily secured, while the 100-volt lamp will burn very low or remainquite dark, Fig. 183b. Now the bars B B1 may be joined at the top by a thickcross bar B2 and it is quite easy to maintain the 100-volt lamp at fullcandle-power while the 50-volt lamp remains dark, Fig. 183c. These results, as Ihave pointed out previously, should not be considered to be due exactly tofrequency but rather to the time rate of change which may be great, even withlow frequencies. A great many other results of the same kind, equallyinteresting, especially to those who are only used to manipulate steadycurrents, may be obtained and they afford precious clues in investigating thenature of electric currents.In the preceding experiments I have already had occasion to show some lightphenomena and it would now be proper to study these in particular; but to makethis investigation more complete I think it necessary to make first a fewremarks on the subject of electrical resonance which has to be always observedin carrying out these experiments.ON ELECTRICAL RESONANCEThe effects of resonance are being more and more noted by engineers and arebecoming of great importance in the practical operation of apparatus of allkinds with alternating currents. A few general remarks may therefore be madeconcerning these effects. It is clear, that if we succeed in employing theeffects of resonance practically in the operation of electric devices the returnwire will, as a matter of course, become unnecessary, for the electric vibrationmay be conveyed with one wire just as well as, and sometimes even better than,with two. The question first to answer is, then, whether pure resonance effectsare producible. Theory and experiment both show that such is impossible inNature, for as the oscillation becomes more and more vigorous, the losses in thevibrating bodies and environing media rapidly increase and necessarily check thevibration which otherwise would go on increasing forever. It is a fortunatecircumstance that pure resonance is not producible, for if it were there is notelling what dangers might not lie in wait for the innocent experimenter. But toa certain degree resonance is producible, the magnitude of the effects beinglimited by the imperfect conductivity and imperfect elasticity of the media or,generally stated, by frictional losses. The smaller these losses, the morestriking are the effects. The same is the case in mechanical vibration. A stoutsteel bar may be set in vibration by drops of water falling upon it at properintervals; and with glass, which is more perfectly elastic, the resonance effectis still more remarkable, for a goblet may be burst by singing into it a note ofthe proper pitch. The electrical resonance is the more perfectly attained, thesmaller the resistance or the impedance of the conducting path and the moreperfect the dielectric. In a Leyden jar discharging through a short strandedcable of thin wires these requirements are probably best fulfilled, and theresonance effects are therefore very prominent. Such is not the case with dynamomachines, transformers and their circuits, or with commercial apparatus ingeneral in which the presence of iron cores complicates the action or renders itimpossible. In regard to Leyden jars with which resonance effects are frequentlydemonstrated, I would say that the effects observed are often attributed but areseldom due to true resonance, for an error is quite easily made in this respect.This may be undoubtedly demonstrated by the following experiment. Take, forinstance, two large insulated metallic plates or spheres which I shall designateA and B; place them at a certain small distance apart and charge them from africtional or influence machine to a potential so high that just a slightincrease of the difference of potential between them will cause the small air orinsulating space to break down. This is easily reached by making a fewpreliminary trials. If now another plate—fastened on an insulating handle andconnected by a wire to one of the terminals of a high tension secondary of aninduction coil, which is maintained in action by an alternator (preferably highfrequency)—is approached to one of the charged bodies A or B, so as to be nearerto either one of them, the discharge will invariably occur between them; atleast it will, if the potential of the coil in connection with the plate issufficiently high. But the explanation of this will soon be found in the factthat the approached plate acts inductively upon the bodies A and B and causes aspark to pass between them. When this spark occurs, the charges which werepreviously imparted to these bodies from the influence machine, must needs belost, since the bodies are brought in electrical connection through the arcformed. Now this arc is formed whether there be resonance or not. But even ifthe spark would not be produced, still there is an alternating E. M. F. set upbetween the bodies when the plate is brought near one of them; therefore theapproach of the plate, if it does not always actually, will, at any rate, tendto break down the air space by inductive action. Instead of the spheres orplates A and B we may take the coatings of a Leyden jar with the same result,and in place of the machine—which is a high frequency alternator preferably,because it is more suitable for the experiment and also for the argument—we maytake another Leyden jar or battery of jars. When such jars are dischargingthrough a circuit of low resistance the same is traversed by currents of veryhigh frequency. The plate may now be connected to one of the coatings of thesecond jar, and when it is brought near to the first jar just previously chargedto a high potential from an influence machine, the result is the same as before,and the first jar will discharge through a small air space upon the second beingcaused to discharge. But both jars and their circuits need not be tuned anycloser than a basso profundo is to the note produced by a mosquito, as smallsparks will be produced through the air space, or at least the latter will beconsiderably more strained owing to the setting up of an alternating E. M. F. byinduction, which takes place when one of the jars begins to discharge. Againanother error of a similar nature is quite easily made. If the circuits of thetwo jars are run parallel and close together, and the experiment has beenperformed of discharging one by the other, and now a coil of wire be added toone of the circuits whereupon the experiment does not succeed, the conclusionthat this is due to the fact that the circuits are now not tuned, would be farfrom being safe. For the two circuits act as condenser coatings and the additionof the coil to one of them is equivalent to bridging them, at the point wherethe coil is placed, by a small condenser, and the effect of the latter might beto prevent the spark from jumping through the discharge space by diminishing thealternating E. M. F. acting across the same. All these remarks, and many morewhich might be added but for fear of wandering too far from the subject, aremade with the pardonable intention of cautioning the unsuspecting student, whomight gain an entirely unwarranted opinion of his skill at seeing everyexperiment succeed; but they are in no way thrust upon the experienced as novelobservations.In order to make reliable observations of electric resonance effects it is verydesirable, if not necessary, to employ an alternator giving currents which riseand fall harmonically, as in working with make and break currents theobservations are not always trustworthy, since many phenomena, which depend onthe rate of change, may be produced with widely different frequencies. Even whenmaking such observations with an alternator one is apt to be mistaken. When acircuit is connected to an alternator there are an indefinite number of valuesfor capacity and self-induction which, in conjunction, will satisfy thecondition of resonance. So there are in mechanics an infinite number of tuningforks which will respond to a note of a certain pitch, or loaded springs whichhave a definite period of vibration. But the resonance will be most perfectlyattained in that case in which the motion is effected with the greatest freedom.Now in mechanics, considering the vibration in the common medium—that is, air—itis of comparatively little importance whether one tuning fork be somewhat largerthan another, because the losses in the air are not very considerable. One may,of course, enclose a tuning fork in an exhausted vessel and by thus reducing theair resistance to a minimum obtain better resonant action. Still the differencewould not be very great. But it would make a great difference if the tuning forkwere immersed in mercury. In the electrical vibration it is of enormousimportance to arrange the conditions so that the vibration is effected with thegreatest freedom. The magnitude of the resonance effect depends, under otherwiseequal conditions, on the quantity of electricity set in motion or on thestrength of the current driven through the circuit. But the circuit opposes thepassage of the currents by reason of its impedance and therefore, to secure thebest action it is necessary to reduce the impedance to a minimum. It isimpossible to overcome it entirely, but merely in part, for the ohmic resistancecannot be overcome. But when the frequency of the impulses is very great, theflow of the current is practically determined by self-induction. Nowself-induction can be overcome by combining it with capacity. If the relationbetween these is such, that at the frequency used they annul each other, thatis, have such values as to satisfy the condition of resonance, and the greatestquantity of electricity is made to flow through the external circuit, then thebest result is obtained. It is simpler and safer to join the condenser in serieswith the self-induction. It is clear that in such combinations there will be,for a given frequency, and considering only the fundamental vibration, valueswhich will give the best result, with the condenser in shunt to theself-induction coil; of course more such values than with the condenser inseries. But practical conditions determine the selection. In the latter case inperforming the experiments one may take a small self-induction and a largecapacity or a small capacity and a large self-induction, but the latter ispreferable, because it is inconvenient to adjust a large capacity by smallsteps. By taking a coil with a very large self-induction the critical capacityis reduced to a very small value, and the capacity of the coil itself may besufficient. It is easy, especially by observing certain artifices, to wind acoil through which the impedance will be reduced to the value of the ohmicresistance only; and for any coil there is, of course, a frequency at which themaximum current will be made to pass through the coil. The observation of therelation between self-induction, capacity and frequency is becoming important inthe operation of alternate current apparatus, such as transformers or motors,because by a judicious determination of the elements the employment of anexpensive condenser becomes unnecessary. Thus it is possible to pass through thecoils of an alternating current motor under the normal working conditions therequired current with a low E. M. F. and do away entirely with the falsecurrent, and the larger the motor, the easier such a plan becomes practicable;but it is necessary for this to employ currents of very high potential or highfrequency.In Fig. 184 I is shown a plan which has been followed in the study of theresonance effects by means of a high frequency alternator. C1 is a coil of manyturns, which is divided into small separate sections for the purpose ofadjustment. The final adjustment was made sometimes with a few thin iron wires(though this is not always advisable) or with a closed secondary. The coil C1 isconnected with one of its ends to the line L from the alternator G and with theother end to one of the plates c of a condenser c c1, the plate (c1) of thelatter being connected to a much larger plate P1. In this manner both capacityand self-induction were adjusted to suit the dynamo frequency.images [images/fig184.jpg]FIG. 184.As regards the rise of potential through resonant action, of course,theoretically, it may amount to anything since it depends on self-induction andresistance and since these may have any value. But in practice one is limited inthe selection of these values and besides these, there are other limitingcauses. One may start with, say, 1,000 volts and raise the E. M. F. to 50 timesthat value, but one cannot start with 100,000 and raise it to ten times thatvalue because of the losses in the media which are great, especially if thefrequency is high. It should be possible to start with, for instance, two voltsfrom a high or low frequency circuit of a dynamo and raise the E. M. F. to manyhundred times that value. Thus coils of the proper dimensions might be connectedeach with only one of its ends to the mains from a machine of low E. M. F., andthough the circuit of the machine would not be closed in the ordinary acceptanceof the term, yet the machine might be burned out if a proper resonance effectwould be obtained. I have not been able to produce, nor have I observed withcurrents from a dynamo machine, such great rises of potential. It is possible,if not probable, that with currents obtained from apparatus containing iron thedisturbing influence of the latter is the cause that these theoreticalpossibilities cannot be realized. But if such is the case I attribute it solelyto the hysteresis and Foucault current losses in the core. Generally it wasnecessary to transform upward, when the E. M. F. was very low, and usually anordinary form of induction coil was employed, but sometimes the arrangementillustrated in Fig. 184 II, has been found to be convenient. In this case a coilC is made in a great many sections, a few of these being used as a primary. Inthis manner both primary and secondary are adjustable. One end of the coil isconnected to the line L1 from the alternator, and the other line L is connectedto the intermediate point of the coil. Such a coil with adjustable primary andsecondary will be found also convenient in experiments with the disruptivedischarge. When true resonance is obtained the top of the wave must of course beon the free end of the coil as, for instance, at the terminal of thephosphorescence bulb B. This is easily recognized by observing the potential ofa point on the wire w near to the coil.In connection with resonance effects and the problem of transmission of energyover a single conductor which was previously considered, I would say a few wordson a subject which constantly fills my thoughts and which concerns the welfareof all. I mean the transmission of intelligible signals or perhaps even power toany distance without the use of wires. I am becoming daily more convinced of thepracticability of the scheme; and though I know full well that the greatmajority of scientific men will not believe that such results can be practicallyand immediately realized, yet I think that all consider the developments inrecent years by a number of workers to have been such as to encourage thoughtand experiment in this direction. My conviction has grown so strong, that I nolonger look upon this plan of energy or intelligence transmission as a meretheoretical possibility, but as a serious problem in electrical engineering,which must be carried out some day. The idea of transmitting intelligencewithout wires is the natural outcome of the most recent results of electricalinvestigations. Some enthusiasts have expressed their belief that telephony toany distance by induction through the air is possible. I cannot stretch myimagination so far, but I do firmly believe that it is practicable to disturb bymeans of powerful machines the electrostatic condition of the earth and thustransmit intelligible signals and perhaps power. In fact, what is there againstthe carrying out of such a scheme? We now know that electric vibration may betransmitted through a single conductor. Why then not try to avail ourselves ofthe earth for this purpose? We need not be frightened by the idea of distance.To the weary wanderer counting the mile-posts the earth may appear very large,but to that happiest of all men, the astronomer, who gazes at the heavens and bytheir standard judges the magnitude of our globe, it appears very small. And soI think it must seem to the electrician, for when he considers the speed withwhich an electric disturbance is propagated through the earth all his ideas ofdistance must completely vanish.A point of great importance would be first to know what is the capacity of theearth? and what charge does it contain if electrified? Though we have nopositive evidence of a charged body existing in space without other oppositelyelectrified bodies being near, there is a fair probability that the earth issuch a body, for by whatever process it was separated from other bodies—and thisis the accepted view of its origin—it must have retained a charge, as occurs inall processes of mechanical separation. If it be a charged body insulated inspace its capacity should be extremely small, less than one-thousandth of afarad. But the upper strata of the air are conducting, and so, perhaps, is themedium in free space beyond the atmosphere, and these may contain an oppositecharge. Then the capacity might be incomparably greater. In any case it is ofthe greatest importance to get an idea of what quantity of electricity the earthcontains. It is difficult to say whether we shall ever acquire this necessaryknowledge, but there is hope that we may, and that is, by means of electricalresonance. If ever we can ascertain at what period the earth’s charge, whendisturbed, oscillates with respect to an oppositely electrified system or knowncircuit, we shall know a fact possibly of the greatest importance to the welfareof the human race. I propose to seek for the period by means of an electricaloscillator, or a source of alternating electric currents. One of the terminalsof the source would be connected to earth as, for instance, to the city watermains, the other to an insulated body of large surface. It is possible that theouter conducting air strata, or free space, contain an opposite charge and that,together with the earth, they form a condenser of very large capacity. In suchcase the period of vibration may be very low and an alternating dynamo machinemight serve for the purpose of the experiment. I would then transform thecurrent to a potential as high as it would be found possible and connect theends of the high tension secondary to the ground and to the insulated body. Byvarying the frequency of the currents and carefully observing the potential ofthe insulated body and watching for the disturbance at various neighboringpoints of the earth’s surface resonance might be detected. Should, as themajority of scientific men in all probability believe, the period be extremelysmall, then a dynamo machine would not do and a proper electrical oscillatorwould have to be produced and perhaps it might not be possible to obtain suchrapid vibrations. But whether this be possible or not, and whether the earthcontains a charge or not, and whatever may be its period of vibration, itcertainly is possible—for of this we have daily evidence—to produce someelectrical disturbance sufficiently powerful to be perceptible by suitableinstruments at any point of the earth’s surface.Assume that a source of alternating current S be connected, as in Fig. 185, withone of its terminals to earth (conveniently to the water mains) and with theother to a body of large surface P. When the electric oscillation is set upthere will be a movement of electricity in and out of P, and alternatingcurrents will pass through the earth, converging to, or diverging from, thepoint C where the ground connection is made. In this manner neighboring pointson the earth’s surface within a certain radius will be disturbed. But thedisturbance will diminish with the distance, and the distance at which theeffect will still be perceptible will depend on the quantity of electricity setin motion. Since the body P is insulated, in order to displace a considerablequantity, the potential of the source must be excessive, since there would belimitations as to the surface of P. The conditions might be adjusted so that thegenerator or source S will set up the same electrical movement as though itscircuit were closed. Thus it is certainly practicable to impress an electricvibration at least of a certain low period upon the earth by means of propermachinery. At what distance such a vibration might be made perceptible can onlybe conjectured. I have on another occasion considered the question how the earthmight behave to electric disturbances. There is no doubt that, since in such anexperiment the electrical density at the surface could be but extremely smallconsidering the size of the earth, the air would not act as a very disturbingfactor, and there would be not much energy lost through the action of the air,which would be the case if the density were great. Theoretically, then, it couldnot require a great amount of energy to produce a disturbance perceptible atgreat distance, or even all over the surface of the globe. Now, it is quitecertain that at any point within a certain radius of the source S a properlyadjusted self-induction and capacity device can be set in action by resonance.But not only can this be done, but another source S1, Fig. 185, similar to S, orany number of such sources, can be set to work in synchronism with the latter,and the vibration thus intensified and spread over a large area, or a flow ofelectricity produced to or from the source S1 if the same be of opposite phaseto the source S. I think that beyond doubt it is possible to operate electricaldevices in a city through the ground or pipe system by resonance from anelectrical oscillator located at a central point. But the practical solution ofthis problem would be of incomparably smaller benefit to man than therealization of the scheme of transmitting intelligence, or perhaps power, to anydistance through the earth or environing medium. If this is at all possible,distance does not mean anything. Proper apparatus must first be produced bymeans of which the problem can be attacked and I have devoted much thought tothis subject. I am firmly convinced that it can be done and hope that we shalllive to see it done.images [images/fig185.jpg]FIG. 185.ON THE LIGHT PHENOMENA PRODUCED BY HIGH-FREQUENCYCURRENTS OF HIGH POTENTIAL AND GENERAL REMARKSRELATING TO THE SUBJECTReturning now to the light effects which it has been the chief object toinvestigate, it is thought proper to divide these effects into four classes: 1.Incandescence of a solid. 2. Phosphorescence. 3. Incandescence orphosphorescence of a rarefied gas; and 4. Luminosity produced in a gas atordinary pressure. The first question is: How are these luminous effectsproduced? In order to answer this question as satisfactorily as I am able to doin the light of accepted views and with the experience acquired, and to add someinterest to this demonstration, I shall dwell here upon a feature which Iconsider of great importance, inasmuch as it promises, besides, to throw abetter light upon the nature of most of the phenomena produced by high-frequencyelectric currents. I have on other occasions pointed out the great importance ofthe presence of the rarefied gas, or atomic medium in general, around theconductor through which alternate currents of high frequency are passed, asregards the heating of the conductor by the currents. My experiments, describedsome time ago, have shown that, the higher the frequency and potentialdifference of the currents, the more important becomes the rarefied gas in whichthe conductor is immersed, as a factor of the heating. The potential difference,however, is, as I then pointed out, a more important element than the frequency.When both of these are sufficiently high, the heating may be almost entirely dueto the presence of the rarefied gas. The experiments to follow will show theimportance of the rarefied gas, or, generally, of gas at ordinary or otherpressure as regards the incandescence or other luminous effects produced bycurrents of this kind.I take two ordinary 50-volt 16 c. p. lamps which are in every respect alike,with the exception, that one has been opened at the top and the air has filledthe bulb, while the other is at the ordinary degree of exhaustion of commerciallamps. When I attach the lamp which is exhausted to the terminal of thesecondary of the coil, which I have already used, as in experiments illustratedin Fig. 179a for instance, and turn on the current, the filament, as you havebefore seen, comes to high incandescence. When I attach the second lamp, whichis filled with air, instead of the former, the filament still glows, but muchless brightly. This experiment illustrates only in part the truth of thestatements before made. The importance of the filament’s being immersed inrarefied gas is plainly noticeable but not to such a degree as might bedesirable. The reason is that the secondary of this coil is wound for lowtension, having only 150 turns, and the potential difference at the terminals ofthe lamp is therefore small. Were I to take another coil with many more turns inthe secondary, the effect would be increased, since it depends partially on thepotential difference, as before remarked. But since the effect likewise dependson the frequency, it maybe properly stated that it depends on the time rate ofthe variation of the potential difference. The greater this variation, the moreimportant becomes the gas as an element of heating. I can produce a much greaterrate of variation in another way, which, besides, has the advantage of doingaway with the objections, which might be made in the experiment just shown, evenif both the lamps were connected in series or multiple arc to the coil, namely,that in consequence of the reactions existing between the primary and secondarycoil the conclusions are rendered uncertain. This result I secure by charging,from an ordinary transformer which is fed from the alternating current supplystation, a battery of condensers, and discharging the latter directly through acircuit of small self-induction, as before illustrated in Figs. 183a, 183b, and183c.In Figs. 186a, 186b and 186c, the heavy copper bars B B1, are connected to theopposite coatings of a battery of condensers, or generally in such way, that thehigh frequency or sudden discharges are made to traverse them. I connect firstan ordinary 50-volt incandescent lamp to the bars by means of the clamps c c.The discharges being passed through the lamp, the filament is renderedincandescent, though the current through it is very small, and would not benearly sufficient to produce a visible effect under the conditions of ordinaryuse of the lamp. Instead of this I now attach to the bars another lamp exactlylike the first, but with the seal broken off, the bulb being therefore filledwith air at ordinary pressure. When the discharges are directed through thefilament, as before, it does not become incandescent. But the result might stillbe attributed to one of the many possible reactions. I therefore connect boththe lamps in multiple arc as illustrated in Fig. 186a. Passing the dischargesthrough both the lamps, again the filament in the exhausted lamp l glows verybrightly while that in the non-exhausted lamp l1 remains dark, as previously.But it should not be thought that the latter lamp is taking only a smallfraction of the energy supplied to both the lamps; on the contrary, it mayconsume a considerable portion of the energy and it may become even hotter thanthe one which burns brightly. In this experiment the potential difference at theterminals of the lamps varies in sign theoretically three to four million timesa second. The ends of the filaments are correspondingly electrified, and the gasin the bulbs is violently agitated and a large portion of the supplied energy isthus converted into heat. In the non-exhausted bulb, there being a few milliontimes more gas molecules than in the exhausted one, the bombardment, which ismost violent at the ends of the filament, in the neck of the bulb, consumes alarge portion of the energy without producing any visible effect. The reason isthat, there being many molecules, the bombardment is quantitativelyconsiderable, but the individual impacts are not very violent, as the speeds ofthe molecules are comparatively small owing to the small free path. In theexhausted bulb, on the contrary, the speeds are very great, and the individualimpacts are violent and therefore better adapted to produce a visible effect.Besides, the convection of heat is greater in the former bulb. In both the bulbsthe current traversing the filaments is very small, incomparably smaller thanthat which they require on an ordinary low-frequency circuit. The potentialdifference, however, at the ends of the filaments is very great and might bepossibly 20,000 volts or more, if the filaments were straight and their ends farapart. In the ordinary lamp a spark generally occurs between the ends of thefilament or between the platinum wires outside, before such a difference ofpotential can be reached.images [images/fig186a.jpg]FIG. 186a.images [images/fig186b.jpg]FIG. 186b.images [images/fig186c.jpg]FIG. 186c.It might be objected that in the experiment before shown the lamps, being inmultiple arc, the exhausted lamp might take a much larger current and that theeffect observed might not be exactly attributable to the action of the gas inthe bulbs. Such objections will lose much weight if I connect the lamps inseries, with the same result. When this is done and the discharges are directedthrough the filaments, it is again noted that the filament in the non-exhaustedbulb l1, remains dark, while that in the exhausted one (l) glows even moreintensely than under its normal conditions of working, Fig. 186b. According togeneral ideas the current through the filaments should now be the same, were itnot modified by the presence of the gas around the filaments.At this juncture I may point out another interesting feature, which illustratesthe effect of the rate of change of potential of the currents. I will leave thetwo lamps connected in series to the bars B B1, as in the previous experiment,Fig. 186b, but will presently reduce considerably the frequency of the currents,which was excessive in the experiment just before shown. This I may do byinserting a self-induction coil in the path of the discharges, or by augmentingthe capacity of the condensers. When I now pass these low-frequency dischargesthrough the lamps, the exhausted lamp l again is as bright as before, but it isnoted also that the non-exhausted lamp l1 glows, though not quite as intenselyas the other. Reducing the current through the lamps, I may bring the filamentin the latter lamp to redness, and, though the filament in the exhausted lamp lis bright, Fig. 186c, the degree of its incandescence is much smaller than inFig. 186b, when the currents were of a much higher frequency.In these experiments the gas acts in two opposite ways in determining the degreeof the incandescence of the filaments, that is, by convection and bombardment.The higher the frequency and potential of the currents, the more importantbecomes the bombardment. The convection on the contrary should be the smaller,the higher the frequency. When the currents are steady there is practically nobombardment, and convection may therefore with such currents also considerablymodify the degree of incandescence and produce results similar to those justbefore shown. Thus, if two lamps exactly alike, one exhausted and one notexhausted, are connected in multiple arc or series to a direct-current machine,the filament in the non-exhausted lamp will require a considerably greatercurrent to be rendered incandescent. This result is entirely due to convection,and the effect is the more prominent the thinner the filament. Professor Ayrtonand Mr. Kilgour some time ago published quantitative results concerning thethermal emissivity by radiation and convection in which the effect with thinwires was clearly shown. This effect may be strikingly illustrated by preparinga number of small, short, glass tubes, each containing through its axis thethinnest obtainable platinum wire. If these tubes be highly exhausted, a numberof them may be connected in multiple arc to a direct-current machine and all ofthe wires may be kept at incandescence with a smaller current than that requiredto render incandescent a single one of the wires if the tube be not exhausted.Could the tubes be so highly exhausted that convection would be nil, then therelative amounts of heat given off by convection and radiation could bedetermined without the difficulties attending thermal quantitative measurements.If a source of electric impulses of high frequency and very high potential isemployed, a still greater number of the tubes may be taken and the wiresrendered incandescent by a current not capable of warming perceptibly a wire ofthe same size immersed in air at ordinary pressure, and conveying the energy toall of them.I may here describe a result which is still more interesting, and to which Ihave been led by the observation of these phenomena. I noted that smalldifferences in the density of the air produced a considerable difference in thedegree of incandescence of the wires, and I thought that, since in a tube,through which a luminous discharge is passed, the gas is generally not ofuniform density, a very thin wire contained in the tube might be renderedincandescent at certain places of smaller density of the gas, while it wouldremain dark at the places of greater density, where the convection would begreater and the bombardment less intense. Accordingly a tube t was prepared, asillustrated in Fig. 187, which contained through the middle a very fine platinumwire w. The tube was exhausted to a moderate degree and it was found that whenit was attached to the terminal of a high-frequency coil the platinum wire wwould indeed, become incandescent in patches, as illustrated in Fig. 187. Latera number of these tubes with one or more wires were prepared, each showing thisresult. The effect was best noted when the striated discharge occurred in thetube, but was also produced when the striae were not visible, showing that, eventhen, the gas in the tube was not of uniform density. The position of the striaewas generally such, that the rarefactions corresponded to the places ofincandescence or greater brightness on the wire w. But in a few instances it wasnoted, that the bright spots on the wire were covered by the dense parts of thestriated discharge as indicated by l in Fig. 187, though the effect was barelyperceptible. This was explained in a plausible way by assuming that theconvection was not widely different in the dense and rarefied places, and thatthe bombardment was greater on the dense places of the striated discharge. Itis, in fact, often observed in bulbs, that under certain conditions a thin wireis brought to higher incandescence when the air is not too highly rarefied. Thisis the case when the potential of the coil is not high enough for the vacuum,but the result may be attributed to many different causes. In all cases thiscurious phenomenon of incandescence disappears when the tube, or rather thewire, acquires throughout a uniform temperature.images [images/fig187.jpg]FIG. 187.Disregarding now the modifying effect of convection there are then two distinctcauses which determine the incandescence of a wire or filament with varyingcurrents, that is, conduction current and bombardment. With steady currents wehave to deal only with the former of these two causes, and the heating effect isa minimum, since the resistance is least to steady flow. When the current is avarying one the resistance is greater, and hence the heating effect isincreased. Thus if the rate of change of the current is very great, theresistance may increase to such an extent that the filament is brought toincandescence with inappreciable currents, and we are able to take a short andthick block of carbon or other material and bring it to bright incandescencewith a current incomparably smaller than that required to bring to the samedegree of incandescence an ordinary thin lamp filament with a steady or lowfrequency current. This result is important, and illustrates how rapidly ourviews on these subjects are changing, and how quickly our field of knowledge isextending. In the art of incandescent lighting, to view this result in oneaspect only, it has been commonly considered as an essential requirement forpractical success, that the lamp filament should be thin and of high resistance.But now we know that the resistance of the filament to the steady flow does notmean anything; the filament might as well be short and thick; for if it beimmersed in rarefied gas it will become incandescent by the passage of a smallcurrent. It all depends on the frequency and potential of the currents. We mayconclude from this, that it would be of advantage, so far as the lamp isconsidered, to employ high frequencies for lighting, as they allow the use ofshort and thick filaments and smaller currents.If a wire or filament be immersed in a homogeneous medium, all the heating isdue to true conduction current, but if it be enclosed in an exhausted vessel theconditions are entirely different. Here the gas begins to act and the heatingeffect of the conduction current, as is shown in many experiments, may be verysmall compared with that of the bombardment. This is especially the case if thecircuit is not closed and the potentials are of course very high. Suppose that afine filament enclosed in an exhausted vessel be connected with one of its endsto the terminal of a high tension coil and with its other end to a largeinsulated plate. Though the circuit is not closed, the filament, as I havebefore shown, is brought to incandescence. If the frequency and potential becomparatively low, the filament is heated by the current passing through it. Ifthe frequency and potential, and principally the latter, be increased, theinsulated plate need be but very small, or may be done away with entirely; stillthe filament will become incandescent, practically all the heating being thendue to the bombardment. A practical way of combining both the effects ofconduction currents and bombardment is illustrated in Fig. 188, in which anordinary lamp is shown provided with a very thin filament which has one of theends of the latter connected to a shade serving the purpose of the insulatedplate, and the other end to the terminal of a high tension source. It should notbe thought that only rarefied gas is an important factor in the heating of aconductor by varying currents, but gas at ordinary pressure may becomeimportant, if the potential difference and frequency of the currents isexcessive. On this subject I have already stated, that when a conductor is fusedby a stroke of lightning, the current through it may be exceedingly small, noteven sufficient to heat the conductor perceptibly, were the latter immersed in ahomogeneous medium.images [images/fig188.jpg]FIG. 188.From the preceding it is clear that when a conductor of high resistance isconnected to the terminals of a source of high frequency currents of highpotential, there may occur considerable dissipation of energy, principally atthe ends of the conductor, in consequence of the action of the gas surroundingthe conductor. Owing to this, the current through a section of the conductor ata point midway between its ends may be much smaller than through a section nearthe ends. Furthermore, the current passes principally through the outer portionsof the conductor, but this effect is to be distinguished from the skin effect asordinarily interpreted, for the latter would, or should, occur also in acontinuous incompressible medium. If a great many incandescent lamps areconnected in series to a source of such currents, the lamps at the ends may burnbrightly, whereas those in the middle may remain entirely dark. This is dueprincipally to bombardment, as before stated. But even if the currents besteady, provided the difference of potential is very great, the lamps at the endwill burn more brightly than those in the middle. In such case there is norhythmical bombardment, and the result is produced entirely by leakage. Thisleakage or dissipation into space when the tension is high, is considerable whenincandescent lamps are used, and still more considerable with arcs, for thelatter act like flames. Generally, of course, the dissipation is much smallerwith steady, than with varying, currents.I have contrived an experiment which illustrates in an interesting manner theeffect of lateral diffusion. If a very long tube is attached to the terminal ofa high frequency coil, the luminosity is greatest near the terminal and fallsoff gradually towards the remote end. This is more marked if the tube is narrow.A small tube about one-half inch in diameter and twelve inches long (Fig. 189),has one of its ends drawn out into a fine fibre f nearly three feet long. Thetube is placed in a brass socket T which can be screwed on the terminal T1 ofthe induction coil. The discharge passing through the tube first illuminates thebottom of the same, which is of comparatively large section; but through thelong glass fibre the discharge cannot pass. But gradually the rarefied gasinside becomes warmed and more conducting and the discharge spreads into theglass fibre. This spreading is so slow, that it may take half a minute or moreuntil the discharge has worked through up to the top of the glass fibre, thenpresenting the appearance of a strongly luminous thin thread. By adjusting thepotential at the terminal the light may be made to travel upwards at any speed.Once, however, the glass fibre is heated, the discharge breaks through itsentire length instantly. The interesting point to be noted is that, the higherthe frequency of the currents, or in other words, the greater relatively thelateral dissipation, at a slower rate may the light be made to propagate throughthe fibre. This experiment is best performed with a highly exhausted and freshlymade tube. When the tube has been used for some time the experiment often fails.It is possible that the gradual and slow impairment of the vacuum is the cause.This slow propagation of the discharge through a very narrow glass tubecorresponds exactly to the propagation of heat through a bar warmed at one end.The quicker the heat is carried away laterally the longer time it will take forthe heat to warm the remote end. When the current of a low frequency coil ispassed through the fibre from end to end, then the lateral dissipation is smalland the discharge instantly breaks through almost without exception.images [images/fig189.jpg]FIG. 189.After these experiments and observations which have shown the importance of thediscontinuity or atomic structure of the medium and which will serve to explain,in a measure at least, the nature of the four kinds of light effects produciblewith these currents, I may now give you an illustration of these effects. Forthe sake of interest I may do this in a manner which to many of you might benovel. You have seen before that we may now convey the electric vibration to abody by means of a single wire or conductor of any kind. Since the human frameis conducting I may convey the vibration through my body.First, as in some previous experiments, I connect my body with one of theterminals of a high-tension transformer and take in my hand an exhausted bulbwhich contains a small carbon button mounted upon a platinum wire leading to theoutside of the bulb, and the button is rendered incandescent as soon as thetransformer is set to work (Fig. 190). I may place a conducting shade on thebulb which serves to intensify the action, but is not necessary. Nor is itrequired that the button should be in conducting connection with the handthrough a wire leading through the glass, for sufficient energy may betransmitted through the glass itself by inductive action to render the buttonincandescent.images [images/fig190.jpg]FIG. 190.Next I take a highly exhausted bulb containing a strongly phosphorescent body,above which is mounted a small plate of aluminum on a platinum wire leading tothe outside, and the currents flowing through my body excite intensephosphorescence in the bulb (Fig. 191). Next again I take in my hand a simpleexhausted tube, and in the same manner the gas inside the tube is renderedhighly incandescent or phosphorescent (Fig. 192). Finally, I may take in my handa wire, bare or covered with thick insulation, it is quite immaterial; theelectrical vibration is so intense as to cover the wire with a luminous film(Fig. 193).images [images/fig191.jpg]FIG. 191.images [images/fig192.jpg]FIG. 192.images [images/fig193.jpg]FIG. 193.A few words must now be devoted to each of these phenomena. In the first place,I will consider the incandescence of a button or of a solid in general, anddwell upon some facts which apply equally to all these phenomena. It was pointedout before that when a thin conductor, such as a lamp filament, for instance, isconnected with one of its ends to the terminal of a transformer of high tensionthe filament is brought to incandescence partly by a conduction current andpartly by bombardment. The shorter and thicker the filament the more importantbecomes the latter, and finally, reducing the filament to a mere button, all theheating must practically be attributed to the bombardment. So in the experimentbefore shown, the button is rendered incandescent by the rhythmical impact offreely movable small bodies in the bulb. These bodies may be the molecules ofthe residual gas, particles of dust or lumps torn from the electrode; whateverthey are, it is certain that the heating of the button is essentially connectedwith the pressure of such freely movable particles, or of atomic matter ingeneral in the bulb. The heating is the more intense the greater the number ofimpacts per second and the greater the energy of each impact. Yet the buttonwould be heated also if it were connected to a source of a steady potential. Insuch a case electricity would be carried away from the button by the freelymovable carriers or particles flying about, and the quantity of electricity thuscarried away might be sufficient to bring the button to incandescence by itspassage through the latter. But the bombardment could not be of great importancein such case. For this reason it would require a comparatively very great supplyof energy to the button to maintain it at incandescence with a steady potential.The higher the frequency of the electric impulses the more economically can thebutton be maintained at incandescence. One of the chief reasons why this is so,is, I believe, that with impulses of very high frequency there is less exchangeof the freely movable carriers around the electrode and this means, that in thebulb the heated matter is better confined to the neighborhood of the button. Ifa double bulb, as illustrated in Fig. 194 be made, comprising a large globe Band a small one b, each containing as usual a filament f mounted on a platinumwire w and w1, it is found, that if the filaments f f be exactly alike, itrequires less energy to keep the filament in the globe b at a certain degree ofincandescence, than that in the globe B. This is due to the confinement of themovable particles around the button. In this case it is also ascertained, thatthe filament in the small globe b is less deteriorated when maintained a certainlength of time at incandescence. This is a necessary consequence of the factthat the gas in the small bulb becomes strongly heated and therefore a very goodconductor, and less work is then performed on the button, since the bombardmentbecomes less intense as the conductivity of the gas increases. In thisconstruction, of course, the small bulb becomes very hot and when it reaches anelevated temperature the convection and radiation on the outside increase. Onanother occasion I have shown bulbs in which this drawback was largely avoided.In these instances a very small bulb, containing a refractory button, wasmounted in a large globe and the space between the walls of both was highlyexhausted. The outer large globe remained comparatively cool in suchconstructions. When the large globe was on the pump and the vacuum between thewalls maintained permanent by the continuous action of the pump, the outer globewould remain quite cold, while the button in the small bulb was kept atincandescence. But when the seal was made, and the button in the small bulbmaintained incandescent some length of time, the large globe too would becomewarmed. From this I conjecture that if vacuous space (as Prof. Dewar finds)cannot convey heat, it is so merely in virtue of our rapid motion through spaceor, generally speaking, by the motion of the medium relatively to us, for apermanent condition could not be maintained without the medium being constantlyrenewed. A vacuum cannot, according to all evidence, be permanently maintainedaround a hot body.images [images/fig194.jpg]FIG. 194.In these constructions, before mentioned, the small bulb inside would, at leastin the first stages, prevent all bombardment against the outer large globe. Itoccurred to me then to ascertain how a metal sieve would behave in this respect,and several bulbs, as illustrated in Fig. 195, were prepared for this purpose.In a globe b, was mounted a thin filament f (or button) upon a platinum wire wpassing through a glass stem and leading to the outside of the globe. Thefilament f was surrounded by a metal sieve s. It was found in experiments withsuch bulbs that a sieve with wide meshes apparently did not in the slightestaffect the bombardment against the globe b. When the vacuum was high, the shadowof the sieve was clearly projected against the globe and the latter would gethot in a short while. In some bulbs the sieve s was connected to a platinum wiresealed in the glass. When this wire was connected to the other terminal of theinduction coil (the E. M. F. being kept low in this case), or to an insulatedplate, the bombardment against the outer globe b was diminished. By taking asieve with fine meshes the bombardment against the globe b was alwaysdiminished, but even then if the exhaustion was carried very far, and when thepotential of the transformer was very high, the globe b would be bombarded andheated quickly, though no shadow of the sieve was visible, owing to thesmallness of the meshes. But a glass tube or other continuous body mounted so asto surround the filament, did entirely cut off the bombardment and for a whilethe outer globe b would remain perfectly cold. Of course when the glass tube wassufficiently heated the bombardment against the outer globe could be noted atonce. The experiments with these bulbs seemed to show that the speeds of theprojected molecules or particles must be considerable (though quiteinsignificant when compared with that of light), otherwise it would be difficultto understand how they could traverse a fine metal sieve without being affected,unless it were found that such small particles or atoms cannot be acted upondirectly at measurable distances. In regard to the speed of the projected atoms,Lord Kelvin has recently estimated it at about one kilometer a second orthereabouts in an ordinary Crookes bulb. As the potentials obtainable with adisruptive discharge coil are much higher than with ordinary coils, the speedsmust, of course, be much greater when the bulbs are lighted from such a coil.Assuming the speed to be as high as five kilometers and uniform through thewhole trajectory, as it should be in a very highly exhausted vessel, then if thealternate electrifications of the electrode would be of a frequency of fivemillion, the greatest distance a particle could get away from the electrodewould be one millimeter, and if it could be acted upon directly at thatdistance, the exchange of electrode matter or of the atoms would be very slowand there would be practically no bombardment against the bulb. This at leastshould be so, if the action of an electrode upon the atoms of the residual gaswould be such as upon electrified bodies which we can perceive. A hot bodyenclosed in an exhausted bulb produces always atomic bombardment, but a hot bodyhas no definite rhythm, for its molecules perform vibrations of all kinds.images [images/fig195.jpg]FIG. 195.If a bulb containing a button or filament be exhausted as high as is possiblewith the greatest care and by the use of the best artifices, it is oftenobserved that the discharge cannot, at first, break through, but after sometime, probably in consequence of some changes within the bulb, the dischargefinally passes through and the button is rendered incandescent. In fact, itappears that the higher the degree of exhaustion the easier is the incandescenceproduced. There seem to be no other causes to which the incandescence might beattributed in such case except to the bombardment or similar action of theresidual gas, or of particles of matter in general. But if the bulb be exhaustedwith the greatest care can these play an important part? Assume the vacuum inthe bulb to be tolerably perfect, the great interest then centers in thequestion: Is the medium which pervades all space continuous or atomic? Ifatomic, then the heating of a conducting button or filament in an exhaustedvessel might be due largely to ether bombardment, and then the heating of aconductor in general through which currents of high frequency or high potentialare passed must be modified by the behavior of such medium; then also the skineffect, the apparent increase of the ohmic resistance, etc., admit, partially atleast, of a different explanation.It is certainly more in accordance with many phenomena observed withhigh-frequency currents to hold that all space is pervaded with free atoms,rather than to assume that it is devoid of these, and dark and cold, for so itmust be, if filled with a continuous medium, since in such there can be neitherheat nor light. Is then energy transmitted by independent carriers or by thevibration of a continuous medium? This important question is by no means as yetpositively answered. But most of the effects which are here considered,especially the light effects, incandescence, or phosphorescence, involve thepresence of free atoms and would be impossible without these.In regard to the incandescence of a refractory button (or filament) in anexhausted receiver, which has been one of the subjects of this investigation,the chief experiences, which may serve as a guide in constructing such bulbs,may be summed up as follows: 1. The button should be as small as possible,spherical, of a smooth or polished surface, and of refractory material whichwithstands evaporation best. 2. The support of the button should be very thinand screened by an aluminum and mica sheet, as I have described on anotheroccasion. 3. The exhaustion of the bulb should be as high as possible. 4. Thefrequency of the currents should be as high as practicable. 5. The currentsshould be of a harmonic rise and fall, without sudden interruptions. 6. The heatshould be confined to the button by inclosing the same in a small bulb orotherwise. 7. The space between the walls of the small bulb and the outer globeshould be highly exhausted.Most of the considerations which apply to the incandescence of a solid justconsidered may likewise be applied to phosphorescence. Indeed, in an exhaustedvessel the phosphorescence is, as a rule, primarily excited by the powerfulbeating of the electrode stream of atoms against the phosphorescent body. Evenin many cases, where there is no evidence of such a bombardment, I think thatphosphorescence is excited by violent impacts of atoms, which are notnecessarily thrown off from the electrode but are acted upon from the sameinductively through the medium or through chains of other atoms. That mechanicalshocks play an important part in exciting phosphorescence in a bulb may be seenfrom the following experiment. If a bulb, constructed as that illustrated inFig. 174, be taken and exhausted with the greatest care so that the dischargecannot pass, the filament f acts by electrostatic induction upon the tube t andthe latter is set in vibration. If the tube o be rather wide, about an inch orso, the filament may be so powerfully vibrated that whenever it hits the glasstube it excites phosphorescence. But the phosphorescence ceases when thefilament comes to rest. The vibration can be arrested and again started byvarying the frequency of the currents. Now the filament has its own period ofvibration, and if the frequency of the currents is such that there is resonance,it is easily set vibrating, though the potential of the currents be small. Ihave often observed that the filament in the bulb is destroyed by suchmechanical resonance. The filament vibrates as a rule so rapidly that it cannotbe seen and the experimenter may at first be mystified. When such an experimentas the one described is carefully performed, the potential of the currents needbe extremely small, and for this reason I infer that the phosphorescence is thendue to the mechanical shock of the filament against the glass, just as it isproduced by striking a loaf of sugar with a knife. The mechanical shock producedby the projected atoms is easily noted when a bulb containing a button isgrasped in the hand and the current turned on suddenly. I believe that a bulbcould be shattered by observing the conditions of resonance.In the experiment before cited it is, of course, open to say, that the glasstube, upon coming in contact with the filament, retains a charge of a certainsign upon the point of contact. If now the filament again touches the glass atthe same point while it is oppositely charged, the charges equalize underevolution of light. But nothing of importance would be gained by such anexplanation. It is unquestionable that the initial charges given to the atoms orto the glass play some part in exciting phosphorescence. So, for instance, if aphosphorescent bulb be first excited by a high frequency coil by connecting itto one of the terminals of the latter and the degree of luminosity be noted, andthen the bulb be highly charged from a Holtz machine by attaching it preferablyto the positive terminal of the machine, it is found that when the bulb is againconnected to the terminal of the high frequency coil, the phosphorescence is farmore intense. On another occasion I have considered the possibility of somephosphorescent phenomena in bulbs being produced by the incandescence of aninfinitesimal layer on the surface of the phosphorescent body. Certainly theimpact of the atoms is powerful enough to produce intense incandescence by thecollisions, since they bring quickly to a high temperature a body ofconsiderable bulk. If any such effect exists, then the best appliance forproducing phosphorescence in a bulb, which we know so far, is a disruptivedischarge coil giving an enormous potential with but few fundamental discharges,say 25–30 per second, just enough to produce a continuous impression upon theeye. It is a fact that such a coil excites phosphorescence under almost anycondition and at all degrees of exhaustion, and I have observed effects whichappear to be due to phosphorescence even at ordinary pressures of theatmosphere, when the potentials are extremely high. But if phosphorescent lightis produced by the equalization of charges of electrified atoms (whatever thismay mean ultimately), then the higher the frequency of the impulses or alternateelectrifications, the more economical will be the light production. It is a longknown and noteworthy fact that all the phosphorescent bodies are poor conductorsof electricity and heat, and that all bodies cease to emit phosphorescent lightwhen they are brought to a certain temperature. Conductors on the contrary donot possess this quality. There are but few exceptions to the rule. Carbon isone of them. Becquerel noted that carbon phosphoresces at a certain elevatedtemperature preceding the dark red. This phenomenon may be easily observed inbulbs provided with a rather large carbon electrode (say, a sphere of sixmillimeters diameter). If the current is turned on after a few seconds, a snowwhite film covers the electrode, just before it gets dark red. Similar effectsare noted with other conducting bodies, but many scientific men will probablynot attribute them to true phosphorescence. Whether true incandescence hasanything to do with phosphorescence excited by atomic impact or mechanicalshocks still remains to be decided, but it is a fact that all conditions, whichtend to localize and increase the heating effect at the point of impact, arealmost invariably the most favorable for the production of phosphorescence. So,if the electrode be very small, which is equivalent to saying in general, thatthe electric density is great; if the potential be high, and if the gas behighly rarefied, all of which things imply high speed of the projected atoms, ormatter, and consequently violent impacts—the phosphorescence is very intense. Ifa bulb provided with a large and small electrode be attached to the terminal ofan induction coil, the small electrode excites phosphorescence while the largeone may not do so, because of the smaller electric density and hence smallerspeed of the atoms. A bulb provided with a large electrode may be grasped withthe hand while the electrode is connected to the terminal of the coil and it maynot phosphoresce; but if instead of grasping the bulb with the hand, the same betouched with a pointed wire, the phosphorescence at once spreads through thebulb, because of the great density at the point of contact. With low frequenciesit seems that gases of great atomic weight excite more intense phosphorescencethan those of smaller weight, as for instance, hydrogen. With high frequenciesthe observations are not sufficiently reliable to draw a conclusion. Oxygen, asis well-known, produces exceptionally strong effects, which may be in part dueto chemical action. A bulb with hydrogen residue seems to be most easilyexcited. Electrodes which are most easily deteriorated produce more intensephosphorescence in bulbs, but the condition is not permanent because of theimpairment of the vacuum and the deposition of the electrode matter upon thephosphorescent surfaces. Some liquids, as oils, for instance, producemagnificent effects of phosphorescence (or fluorescence?), but they last only afew seconds. So if a bulb has a trace of oil on the walls and the current isturned on, the phosphorescence only persists for a few moments until the oil iscarried away. Of all bodies so far tried, sulphide of zinc seems to be the mostsusceptible to phosphorescence. Some samples, obtained through the kindness ofProf. Henry in Paris, were employed in many of these bulbs. One of the defectsof this sulphide is, that it loses its quality of emitting light when brought toa temperature which is by no means high. It can therefore, be used only forfeeble intensities. An observation which might deserve notice is, that whenviolently bombarded from an aluminum electrode it assumes a black color, butsingularly enough, it returns to the original condition when it cools down.The most important fact arrived at in pursuing investigations in this directionis, that in all cases it is necessary, in order to excite phosphorescence with aminimum amount of energy, to observe certain conditions. Namely, there isalways, no matter what the frequency of the currents, degree of exhaustion andcharacter of the bodies in the bulb, a certain potential (assuming the bulbexcited from one terminal) or potential difference (assuming the bulb to beexcited with both terminals) which produces the most economical result. If thepotential be increased, considerable energy may be wasted without producing anymore light, and if it be diminished, then again the light production is not aseconomical. The exact condition under which the best result is obtained seems todepend on many things of a different nature, and it is to be yet investigated byother experimenters, but it will certainly have to be observed when suchphosphorescent bulbs are operated, if the best results are to be obtained.Coming now to the most interesting of these phenomena, the incandescence orphosphorescence of gases, at low pressures or at the ordinary pressure of theatmosphere, we must seek the explanation of these phenomena in the same primarycauses, that is, in shocks or impacts of the atoms. Just as molecules or atomsbeating upon a solid body excite phosphorescence in the same or render itincandescent, so when colliding among themselves they produce similar phenomena.But this is a very insufficient explanation and concerns only the crudemechanism. Light is produced by vibrations which go on at a rate almostinconceivable. If we compute, from the energy contained in the form of knownradiations in a definite space the force which is necessary to set up such rapidvibrations, we find, that though the density of the ether be incomparablysmaller than that of any body we know, even hydrogen, the force is somethingsurpassing comprehension. What is this force, which in mechanical measure mayamount to thousands of tons per square inch? It is electrostatic force in thelight of modern views. It is impossible to conceive how a body of measurabledimensions could be charged to so high a potential that the force would besufficient to produce these vibrations. Long before any such charge could beimparted to the body it would be shattered into atoms. The sun emits light andheat, and so does an ordinary flame or incandescent filament, but in neither ofthese can the force be accounted for if it be assumed that it is associated withthe body as a whole. Only in one way may we account for it, namely, byidentifying it with the atom. An atom is so small, that if it be charged bycoming in contact with an electrified body and the charge be assumed to followthe same law as in the case of bodies of measurable dimensions, it must retain aquantity of electricity which is fully capable of accounting for these forcesand tremendous rates of vibration. But the atom behaves singularly in thisrespect—it always takes the same “charge.”It is very likely that resonant vibration plays a most important part in allmanifestations of energy in nature. Throughout space all matter is vibrating,and all rates of vibration are represented, from the lowest musical note to thehighest pitch of the chemical rays, hence an atom, or complex of atoms, nomatter what its period, must find a vibration with which it is in resonance.When we consider the enormous rapidity of the light vibrations, we realize theimpossibility of producing such vibrations directly with any apparatus ofmeasurable dimensions, and we are driven to the only possible means of attainingthe object of setting up waves of light by electrical means and economically,that is, to affect the molecules or atoms of a gas, to cause them to collide andvibrate. We then must ask ourselves—How can free molecules or atoms be affected?It is a fact that they can be affected by electrostatic force, as is apparent inmany of these experiments. By varying the electrostatic force we can agitate theatoms, and cause them to collide accompanied by evolution of heat and light. Itis not demonstrated beyond doubt that we can affect them otherwise. If aluminous discharge is produced in a closed exhausted tube, do the atoms arrangethemselves in obedience to any other but to electrostatic force acting instraight lines from atom to atom? Only recently I investigated the mutual actionbetween two circuits with extreme rates of vibration. When a battery of a fewjars (c c c c, Fig. 196) is discharged through a primary P of low resistance(the connections being as illustrated in Figs. 183a, 183b and 183c), and thefrequency of vibration is many millions there are great differences of potentialbetween points on the primary not more than a few inches apart. Thesedifferences may be 10,000 volts per inch, if not more, taking the maximum valueof the E. M. F. The secondary s is therefore acted upon by electrostaticinduction, which is in such extreme cases of much greater importance than theelectro-dynamic. To such sudden impulses the primary as well as the secondaryare poor conductors, and therefore great differences of potential may beproduced by electrostatic induction between adjacent points on the secondary.Then sparks may jump between the wires and streamers become visible in the darkif the light of the discharge through the spark gap d d be carefully excluded.If now we substitute a closed vacuum tube for the metallic secondary s, thedifferences of potential produced in the tube by electrostatic induction fromthe primary are fully sufficient to excite portions of it; but as the points ofcertain differences of potential on the primary are not fixed, but are generallyconstantly changing in position, a luminous band is produced in the tube,apparently not touching the glass, as it should, if the points of maximum andminimum differences of potential were fixed on the primary. I do not exclude thepossibility of such a tube being excited only by electro-dynamic induction, forvery able physicists hold this view; but in my opinion, there is as yet nopositive proof given that atoms of a gas in a closed tube may arrange themselvesin chains under the action of an electromotive impulse produced byelectro-dynamic induction in the tube. I have been unable so far to producestriae in a tube, however long, and at whatever degree of exhaustion, that is,striae at right angles to the supposed direction of the discharge or the axis ofthe tube; but I have distinctly observed in a large bulb, in which a wideluminous band was produced by passing a discharge of a battery through a wiresurrounding the bulb, a circle of feeble luminosity between two luminous bands,one of which was more intense than the other. Furthermore, with my presentexperience I do not think that such a gas discharge in a closed tube canvibrate, that is, vibrate as a whole. I am convinced that no discharge through agas can vibrate. The atoms of a gas behave very curiously in respect to suddenelectric impulses. The gas does not seem to possess any appreciable inertia tosuch impulses, for it is a fact, that the higher the frequency of the impulses,with the greater freedom does the discharge pass through the gas. If the gaspossesses no inertia then it cannot vibrate, for some inertia is necessary forthe free vibration. I conclude from this that if a lightning discharge occursbetween two clouds, there can be no oscillation, such as would be expected,considering the capacity of the clouds. But if the lightning discharge strikethe earth, there is always vibration—in the earth, but not in the cloud. In agas discharge each atom vibrates at its own rate, but there is no vibration ofthe conducting gaseous mass as a whole. This is an important consideration inthe great problem of producing light economically, for it teaches us that toreach this result we must use impulses of very high frequency and necessarilyalso of high potential. It is a fact that oxygen produces a more intense lightin a tube. Is it because oxygen atoms possess some inertia and the vibrationdoes not die out instantly? But then nitrogen should be as good, and chlorineand vapors of many other bodies much better than oxygen, unless the magneticproperties of the latter enter prominently into play. Or, is the process in thetube of an electrolytic nature? Many observations certainly speak for it, themost important being that matter is always carried away from the electrodes andthe vacuum in a bulb cannot be permanently maintained. If such process takesplace in reality, then again must we take refuge in high frequencies, for, withsuch, electrolytic action should be reduced to a minimum, if not renderedentirely impossible. It is an undeniable fact that with very high frequencies,provided the impulses be of harmonic nature, like those obtained from analternator, there is less deterioration and the vacua are more permanent. Withdisruptive discharge coils there are sudden rises of potential and the vacua aremore quickly impaired, for the electrodes are deteriorated in a very short time.It was observed in some large tubes, which were provided with heavy carbonblocks B B1, connected to platinum wires w w1 (as illustrated in Fig. 197), andwhich were employed in experiments with the disruptive discharge instead of theordinary air gap, that the carbon particles under the action of the powerfulmagnetic field in which the tube was placed, were deposited in regular finelines in the middle of the tube, as illustrated. These lines were attributed tothe deflection or distortion of the discharge by the magnetic field, but why thedeposit occurred principally where the field was most intense did not appearquite clear. A fact of interest, likewise noted, was that the presence of astrong magnetic field increases the deterioration of the electrodes, probably byreason of the rapid interruptions it produces, whereby there is actually ahigher E. M. F. maintained between the electrodes.images [images/fig196.jpg]FIG. 196.images [images/fig197.jpg]FIG. 197.Much would remain to be said about the luminous effects produced in gases at lowor ordinary pressures. With the present experiences before us we cannot say thatthe essential nature of these charming phenomena is sufficiently known. Butinvestigations in this direction are being pushed with exceptional ardor. Everyline of scientific pursuit has its fascinations, but electrical investigationappears to possess a peculiar attraction, for there is no experiment orobservation of any kind in the domain of this wonderful science which would notforcibly appeal to us. Yet to me it seems, that of all the many marvelous thingswe observe, a vacuum tube, excited by an electric impulse from a distant source,bursting forth out of the darkness and illuminating the room with its beautifullight, is as lovely a phenomenon as can greet our eyes. More interesting stillit appears when, reducing the fundamental discharges across the gap to a verysmall number and waving the tube about we produce all kinds of designs inluminous lines. So by way of amusement I take a straight long tube, or a squareone, or a square attached to a straight tube, and by whirling them about in thehand, I imitate the spokes of a wheel, a Gramme winding, a drum winding, analternate current motor winding, etc. (Fig. 198). Viewed from a distance theeffect is weak and much of its beauty is lost, but being near or holding thetube in the hand, one cannot resist its charm.images [images/fig198.jpg]FIG. 198.In presenting these insignificant results I have not attempted to arrange andco-ordinate them, as would be proper in a strictly scientific investigation, inwhich every succeeding result should be a logical sequence of the preceding, sothat it might be guessed in advance by the careful reader or attentive listener.I have preferred to concentrate my energies chiefly upon advancing novel factsor ideas which might serve as suggestions to others, and this may serve as anexcuse for the lack of harmony. The explanations of the phenomena have beengiven in good faith and in the spirit of a student prepared to find that theyadmit of a better interpretation. There can be no great harm in a student takingan erroneous view, but when great minds err, the world must dearly pay for theirmistakes.______________________* A lecture delivered before the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, February,1893, and before the National Electric Light Association, St. Louis, March,1893."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXIX [05_Contents.xhtml#r32]TESLA ALTERNATING CURRENT GENERATORSFOR HIGH FREQUENCY, IN DETAIL [05_Contents.xhtml#r32]It has become a common practice to operate arc lamps by alternating orpulsating, as distinguished from continuous, currents; but an objection whichhas been raised to such systems exists in the fact that the arcs emit apronounced sound, varying with the rate of the alternations or pulsations ofcurrent. This noise is due to the rapidly alternating heating and cooling, andconsequent expansion and contraction, of the gaseous matter forming the arc,which corresponds with the periods or impulses of the current. Anotherdisadvantageous feature is found in the difficulty of maintaining an alternatingcurrent arc in consequence of the periodical increase in resistancecorresponding to the periodical working of the current. This feature entails afurther disadvantage, namely, that small arcs are impracticable.Theoretical considerations have led Mr. Tesla to the belief that thesedisadvantageous features could be obviated by employing currents of asufficiently high number of alternations, and his anticipations have beenconfirmed in practice. These rapidly alternating currents render it possible tomaintain small arcs which, besides, possess the advantages of silence andpersistency. The latter quality is due to the necessarily rapid alternations, inconsequence of which the arc has no time to cool, and is always maintained at ahigh temperature and low resistance.At the outset of his experiments Mr. Tesla encountered great difficulties in theconstruction of high frequency machines. A generator of this kind is describedhere, which, though constructed quite some time ago, is well worthy of adetailed description. It may be mentioned, in passing, that dynamos of this typehave been used by Mr. Tesla in his lighting researches and experiments withcurrents of high potential and high frequency, and reference to them will befound in his lectures elsewhere printed in this volume.In the accompanying engravings, Figs. 199 and 200 show the machine,respectively, in side elevation and vertical cross-section; Figs. 201, 202 and203 showing enlarged details of construction. As will be seen, A is an annularmagnetic frame, the interior of which is provided with a large number ofpole-pieces D.images [images/fig199.jpg]FIG. 199.images [images/fig200.jpg]FIGS. 200, 201, 202 and 203.Owing to the very large number and small size of the poles and the spacesbetween them, the field coils are applied by winding an insulated conductor Fzigzag through the grooves, as shown in Fig. 203, carrying the wire around theannulus to form as many layers as is desired. In this way the pole-pieces D willbe energized with alternately opposite polarity around the entire ring.For the armature, Mr. Tesla employs a spider carrying a ring J, turned down,except at its edges, to form a trough-like receptacle for a mass of fineannealed iron wires K, which are wound in the groove to form the core proper forthe armature-coils. Pins L are set in the sides of the ring J and the coils Mare wound over the periphery of the armature-structure and around the pins. Thecoils M are connected together in series, and these terminals N carried throughthe hollow shaft H to contact-rings P P, from which the currents are taken offby brushes O.In this way a machine with a very large number of poles may be constructed. Itis easy, for instance, to obtain in this manner three hundred and seventy-fiveto four hundred poles in a machine that may be safely driven at a speed offifteen hundred or sixteen hundred revolutions per minute, which will produceten thousand or eleven thousand alternations of current per second. Arc lamps RR are shown in the diagram as connected up in series with the machine in Fig.200. If such a current be applied to running arc lamps, the sound produced by orin the arc becomes practically inaudible, for, by increasing the rate of changein the current, and consequently the number of vibrations per unit of time ofthe gaseous material of the arc up to, or beyond, ten thousand or eleventhousand per second, or to what is regarded as the limit of audition, the sounddue to such vibrations will not be audible. The exact number of changes orundulations necessary to produce this result will vary somewhat according to thesize of the arc—that is to say, the smaller the arc, the greater the number ofchanges that will be required to render it inaudible within certain limits. Itshould also be stated that the arc should not exceed a certain length.The difficulties encountered in the construction of these machines are of amechanical as well as an electrical nature. The machines may be designed on twoplans: the field may be formed either of alternating poles, or of polarprojections of the same polarity. Up to about 15,000 alternations per second inan experimental machine, the former plan may be followed, but a more efficientmachine is obtained on the second plan.In the machine above described, which was capable of running two arcs of normalcandle power, the field was composed of a ring of wrought iron 32 inches outsidediameter, and about 1 inch thick. The inside diameter was 30 inches. There were384 polar projections. The wire was wound in zigzag form, but two wires werewound so as to completely envelop the projections. The distance between theprojections is about images [images/img_p393-1.jpg] inch, and they are a littleover images [images/img_p137.jpg] inch thick. The field magnet was maderelatively small so as to adapt the machine for a constant current. There are384 coils connected in two series. It was found impracticable to use any wiremuch thicker than No. 26 B. and S. gauge on account of the local effects. Insuch a machine the clearance should be as small as possible; for this reason themachine was made only 1¼ inch wide, so that the binding wires might be obviated.The armature wires must be wound with great care, as they are apt to fly off inconsequence of the great peripheral speed. In various experiments this machinehas been run as high as 3,000 revolutions per minute. Owing to the great speedit was possible to obtain as high as 10 amperes out of the machine. Theelectromotive force was regulated by means of an adjustable condenser withinvery wide limits, the limits being the greater, the greater the speed. Thismachine was frequently used to run Mr. Tesla’s laboratory lights.The machine above described was only one of many such types constructed. Itserves well for an experimental machine, but if still higher alternations arerequired and higher efficiency is necessary, then a machine on a plan shown inFigs. 204 to 207, is preferable. The principal advantage of this type of machineis that there is not much magnetic leakage, and that a field may be produced,varying greatly in intensity in places not much distant from each other.images [images/fig204.jpg]FIG. 204.images [images/fig205.jpg]FIG. 205.images [images/fig206.jpg]FIG. 206.images [images/fig207.jpg]FIG. 207.In these engravings, Figs. 204 and 205 illustrate a machine in which thearmature conductor and field coils are stationary, while the field magnet corerevolves. Fig. 206 shows a machine embodying the same plan of construction, buthaving a stationary field magnet and rotary armature.The conductor in which the currents are induced may be arranged in various ways;but Mr. Tesla prefers the following method: He employs an annular plate ofcopper D, and by means of a saw cuts in it radial slots from one edge nearlythrough to the other, beginning alternately from opposite edges. In this way acontinuous zigzag conductor is formed. When the polar projections are ⅛ inchwide, the width of the conductor should not, under any circumstances, be morethan images [images/img_p394.jpg] inch wide; even then the eddy effect isconsiderable.To the inner edge of this plate are secured two rings of nonmagnetic metal E,which are insulated from the copper conductor, but held firmly thereto by meansof the bolts F. Within the rings E is then placed an annular coil G, which isthe energizing coil for the field magnet. The conductor D and the parts attachedthereto are supported by means of the cylindrical shell or casting A A, the twoparts of which are brought together and clamped to the outer edge of theconductor D.The core for the field magnet is built up of two circular parts H H, formed withannular grooves I, which, when the two parts are brought together, form a spacefor the reception of the energizing coil G. The hubs of the cores are trued off,so as to fit closely against one another, while the outer portions or flangeswhich form the polar faces J J, are reduced somewhat in thickness to make roomfor the conductor D, and are serrated on their faces. The number of serrationsin the polar faces is arbitrary; but there must exist between them and theradial portions of the conductor D certain relation, which will be understood byreference to Fig. 207 in which N N represent the projections or points on oneface of the core of the field, and S S the points of the other face. Theconductor D is shown in this figure in section a a′ designating the radialportions of the conductor, and b the insulating divisions between them. Therelative width of the parts a a′ and the space between any two adjacent points NN or S S is such that when the radial portions a of the conductor are passingbetween the opposite points N S where the field is strongest, the intermediateradial portions a′ are passing through the widest spaces midway between suchpoints and where the field is weakest. Since the core on one side is of oppositepolarity to the part facing it, all the projections of one polar face will be ofopposite polarity to those of the other face. Hence, although the space betweenany two adjacent points on the same face may be extremely small, there will beno leakage of the magnetic lines between any two points of the same name, butthe lines of force will pass across from one set of points to the other. Theconstruction followed obviates to a great degree the distortion of the magneticlines by the action of the current in the conductor D, in which it will beobserved the current is flowing at any given time from the center toward theperiphery in one set of radial parts a and in the opposite direction in theadjacent parts a′.In order to connect the energizing coil G, Fig. 204, with a source of continuouscurrent, Mr. Tesla utilizes two adjacent radial portions of the conductor D forconnecting the terminals of the coil G with two binding posts M. For thispurpose the plate D is cut entirely through, as shown, and the break thus madeis bridged over by a short conductor C. The plate D is cut through to form twoterminals d, which are connected to binding posts N. The core H H, when rotatedby the driving pulley, generates in the conductors D an alternating current,which is taken off from the binding posts N.When it is desired to rotate the conductor between the faces of a stationaryfield magnet, the construction shown in Fig. 206, is adopted. The conductor D inthis case is or may be made in substantially the same manner as above describedby slotting an annular conducting-plate and supporting it between two heads O,held together by bolts o and fixed to the driving-shaft K. The inner edge of theplate or conductor D is preferably flanged to secure a firmer union between itand the heads O. It is insulated from the head. The field-magnet in this caseconsists of two annular parts H H, provided with annular grooves I for thereception of the coils. The flanges or faces surrounding the annular groove arebrought together, while the inner flanges are serrated, as in the previous case,and form the polar faces. The two parts H H are formed with a base R, upon whichthe machine rests. S S are non-magnetic bushings secured or set in the centralopening of the cores. The conductor D is cut entirely through at one point toform terminals, from which insulated conductors T are led through the shaft tocollecting-rings V.In one type of machine of this kind constructed by Mr. Tesla, the field had 480polar projections on each side, and from this machine it was possible to obtain30,000 alternations per second. As the polar projections must necessarily bevery narrow, very thin wires or sheets must be used to avoid the eddy currenteffects. Mr. Tesla has thus constructed machines with a stationary armature androtating field, in which case also the field-coil was supported so that therevolving part consisted only of a wrought iron body devoid of any wire and alsomachines with a rotating armature and stationary field. The machines may beeither drum or disc, but Mr. Tesla’s experience shows the latter to bepreferable.images [images/img_p397.jpg]In the course of a very interesting article contributed to the Electrical Worldin February, 1891, Mr. Tesla makes some suggestive remarks on these highfrequency machines and his experiences with them, as well as with other parts ofthe high frequency apparatus. Part of it is quoted here and is as follows:The writer will incidentally mention that anyone who attempts for the first timeto construct such a machine will have a tale of woe to tell. He will first startout, as a matter of course, by making an armature with the required number ofpolar projections. He will then get the satisfaction of having produced anapparatus which is fit to accompany a thoroughly Wagnerian opera. It may besidespossess the virtue of converting mechanical energy into heat in a nearly perfectmanner. If there is a reversal in the polarity of the projections, he will getheat out of the machine; if there is no reversal, the heating will be less, butthe output will be next to nothing. He will then abandon the iron in thearmature, and he will get from the Scylla to the Charybdis. He will look for onedifficulty and will find another, but, after a few trials, he may get nearlywhat he wanted.Among the many experiments which may be performed with such a machine, of notthe least interest are those performed with a high-tension induction coil. Thecharacter of the discharge is completely changed. The arc is established at muchgreater distances, and it is so easily affected by the slightest current of airthat it often wriggles around in the most singular manner. It usually emits therhythmical sound peculiar to the alternate current arcs, but the curious pointis that the sound may be heard with a number of alternations far above tenthousand per second, which by many is considered to be about the limit ofaudition. In many respects the coil behaves like a static machine. Points impairconsiderably the sparking interval, electricity escaping from them freely, andfrom a wire attached to one of the terminals streams of light issue, as thoughit were connected to a pole of a powerful Toepler machine. All these phenomenaare, of course, mostly due to the enormous differences of potential obtained. Asa consequence of the self-induction of the coil and the high frequency, thecurrent is minute while there is a corresponding rise of pressure. A currentimpulse of some strength started in such a coil should persist to flow no lessthan four ten-thousandths of a second. As this time is greater than half theperiod, it occurs that an opposing electromotive force begins to act while thecurrent is still flowing. As a consequence, the pressure rises as in a tubefilled with liquid and vibrated rapidly around its axis. The current is so smallthat, in the opinion and involuntary experience of the writer, the discharge ofeven a very large coil cannot produce seriously injurious effects, whereas, ifthe same coil were operated with a current of lower frequency, though theelectromotive force would be much smaller, the discharge would be most certainlyinjurious. This result, however, is due in part to the high frequency. Thewriter’s experiences tend to show that the higher the frequency the greater theamount of electrical energy which may be passed through the body without seriousdiscomfort; whence it seems certain that human tissues act as condensers.One is not quite prepared for the behavior of the coil when connected to aLeyden jar. One, of course, anticipates that since the frequency is high thecapacity of the jar should be small. He therefore takes a very small jar, aboutthe size of a small wine glass, but he finds that even with this jar the coil ispractically short-circuited. He then reduces the capacity until he comes toabout the capacity of two spheres, say, ten centimeters in diameter and two tofour centimeters apart. The discharge then assumes the form of a serrated bandexactly like a succession of sparks viewed in a rapidly revolving mirror; theserrations, of course, corresponding to the condenser discharges. In this caseone may observe a queer phenomenon. The discharge starts at the nearest points,works gradually up, breaks somewhere near the top of the spheres, begins againat the bottom, and so on. This goes on so fast that several serrated bands areseen at once. One may be puzzled for a few minutes, but the explanation issimple enough. The discharge begins at the nearest points, the air is heated andcarries the arc upward until it breaks, when it is reestablished at the nearestpoints, etc. Since the current passes easily through a condenser of even smallcapacity, it will be found quite natural that connecting only one terminal to abody of the same size, no matter how well insulated, impairs considerably thestriking distance of the arc.Experiments with Geissler tubes are of special interest. An exhausted tube,devoid of electrodes of any kind, will light up at some distance from the coil.If a tube from a vacuum pump is near the coil the whole of the pump isbrilliantly lighted. An incandescent lamp approached to the coil lights up andgets perceptibly hot. If a lamp have the terminals connected to one of thebinding posts of the coil and the hand is approached to the bulb, a very curiousand rather unpleasant discharge from the glass to the hand takes place, and thefilament may become incandescent. The discharge resembles to some extent thestream issuing from the plates of a powerful Toepler machine, but is ofincomparably greater quantity. The lamp in this case acts as a condenser, therarefied gas being one coating, the operator’s hand the other. By taking theglobe of a lamp in the hand, and by bringing the metallic terminals near to orin contact with a conductor connected to the coil, the carbon is brought tobright incandescence and the glass is rapidly heated. With a 100-volt 10 c. p.lamp one may without great discomfort stand as much current as will bring thelamp to a considerable brilliancy; but it can be held in the hand only for a fewminutes, as the glass is heated in an incredibly short time. When a tube islighted by bringing it near to the coil it may be made to go out by interposinga metal plate on the hand between the coil and tube; but if the metal plate befastened to a glass rod or otherwise insulated, the tube may remain lighted ifthe plate be interposed, or may even increase in luminosity. The effect dependson the position of the plate and tube relatively to the coil, and may be alwayseasily foretold by assuming that conduction takes place from one terminal of thecoil to the other. According to the position of the plate, it may either divertfrom or direct the current to the tube.In another line of work the writer has in frequent experiments maintainedincandescent lamps of 50 or 100 volts burning at any desired candle power withboth the terminals of each lamp connected to a stout copper wire of no more thana few feet in length. These experiments seem interesting enough, but they arenot more so than the queer experiment of Faraday, which has been revived andmade much of by recent investigators, and in which a discharge is made to jumpbetween two points of a bent copper wire. An experiment may be cited here whichmay seem equally interesting. If a Geissler tube, the terminals of which arejoined by a copper wire, be approached to the coil, certainly no one would beprepared to see the tube light up. Curiously enough, it does light up, and, whatis more, the wire does not seem to make much difference. Now one is apt to thinkin the first moment that the impedance of the wire might have something to dowith the phenomenon. But this is of course immediately rejected, as for this anenormous frequency would be required. This result, however, seems puzzling onlyat first; for upon reflection it is quite clear that the wire can make butlittle difference. It may be explained in more than one way, but it agreesperhaps best with observation to assume that conduction takes place from theterminals of the coil through the space. On this assumption, if the tube withthe wire be held in any position, the wire can divert little more than thecurrent which passes through the space occupied by the wire and the metallicterminals of the tube; through the adjacent space the current passes practicallyundisturbed. For this reason, if the tube be held in any position at rightangles to the line joining the binding posts of the coil, the wire makes hardlyany difference, but in a position more or less parallel with that line itimpairs to a certain extent the brilliancy of the tube and its facility to lightup. Numerous other phenomena may be explained on the same assumption. Forinstance, if the ends of the tube be provided with washers of sufficient sizeand held in the line joining the terminals of the coil, it will not light up,and then nearly the whole of the current, which would otherwise pass uniformlythrough the space between the washers, is diverted through the wire. But if thetube be inclined sufficiently to that line, it will light up in spite of thewashers. Also, if a metal plate be fastened upon a glass rod and held at rightangles to the line joining the binding posts, and nearer to one of them, a tubeheld more or less parallel with the line will light up instantly when one of theterminals touches the plate, and will go out when separated from the plate. Thegreater the surface of the plate, up to a certain limit, the easier the tubewill light up. When a tube is placed at right angles to the straight linejoining the binding posts, and then rotated, its luminosity steadily increasesuntil it is parallel with that line. The writer must state, however, that hedoes not favor the idea of a leakage or current through the space any more thanas a suitable explanation, for he is convinced that all these experiments couldnot be performed with a static machine yielding a constant difference ofpotential, and that condenser action is largely concerned in these phenomena.It is well to take certain precautions when operating a Ruhmkorff coil with veryrapidly alternating currents. The primary current should not be turned on toolong, else the core may get so hot as to melt the gutta-percha or paraffin, orotherwise injure the insulation, and this may occur in a surprisingly shorttime, considering the current’s strength. The primary current being turned on,the fine wire terminals may be joined without great risk, the impedance being sogreat that it is difficult to force enough current through the fine wire so asto injure it, and in fact the coil may be on the whole much safer when theterminals of the fine wire are connected than when they are insulated; butspecial care should be taken when the terminals are connected to the coatings ofa Leyden jar, for with anywhere near the critical capacity, which justcounteracts the self-induction at the existing frequency, the coil might meetthe fate of St. Polycarpus. If an expensive vacuum pump is lighted up by beingnear to the coil or touched with a wire connected to one of the terminals, thecurrent should be left on no more than a few moments, else the glass will becracked by the heating of the rarefied gas in one of the narrow passages—in thewriter’s own experience quod erat demonstrandum.*There are a good many other points of interest which may be observed inconnection with such a machine. Experiments with the telephone, a conductor in astrong field or with a condenser or arc, seem to afford certain proof thatsounds far above the usual accepted limit of hearing would be perceived. Atelephone will emit notes of twelve to thirteen thousand vibrations per second;then the inability of the core to follow such rapid alternations begins to tell.If, however, the magnet and core be replaced by a condenser and the terminalsconnected to the high-tension secondary of a transformer, higher notes may stillbe heard. If the current be sent around a finely laminated core and a smallpiece of thin sheet iron be held gently against the core, a sound may be stillheard with thirteen to fourteen thousand alternations per second, provided thecurrent is sufficiently strong. A small coil, however, tightly packed betweenthe poles of a powerful magnet, will emit a sound with the above number ofalternations, and arcs may be audible with a still higher frequency. The limitof audition is variously estimated. In Sir William Thomson’s writings it isstated somewhere that ten thousand per second, or nearly so, is the limit.Other, but less reliable, sources give it as high as twenty-four thousand persecond. The above experiments have convinced the writer that notes of anincomparably higher number of vibrations per second would be perceived providedthey could be produced with sufficient power. There is no reason why it shouldnot be so. The condensations and rarefactions of the air would necessarily setthe diaphragm in a corresponding vibration and some sensation would be produced,whatever—within certain limits—the velocity of transmission to their nervecenters, though it is probable that for want of exercise the ear would not beable to distinguish any such high note. With the eye it is different; if thesense of vision is based upon some resonance effect, as many believe, no amountof increase in the intensity of the ethereal vibration could extend our range ofvision on either side of the visible spectrum.The limit of audition of an arc depends on its size. The greater the surface bya given heating effect in the arc, the higher the limit of audition. The highestnotes are emitted by the high-tension discharges of an induction coil in whichthe arc is, so to speak, all surface. If R be the resistance of an arc, and Cthe current, and the linear dimensions be n times increased, then the resistanceis R/n, and with the same current density the current would be n2C; hence theheating effect is n3 times greater, while the surface is only n2 times as great.For this reason very large arcs would not emit any rhythmical sound even with avery low frequency. It must be observed, however, that the sound emitted dependsto some extent also on the composition of the carbon. If the carbon containhighly refractory material, this, when heated, tends to maintain the temperatureof the arc uniform and the sound is lessened; for this reason it would seem thatan alternating arc requires such carbons.With currents of such high frequencies it is possible to obtain noiseless arcs,but the regulation of the lamp is rendered extremely difficult on account of theexcessively small attractions or repulsions between conductors conveying thesecurrents.An interesting feature of the arc produced by these rapidly alternating currentsis its persistency. There are two causes for it, one of which is always present,the other sometimes only. One is due to the character of the current and theother to a property of the machine. The first cause is the more important one,and is due directly to the rapidity of the alternations. When an arc is formedby a periodically undulating current, there is a corresponding undulation in thetemperature of the gaseous column, and, therefore, a corresponding undulation inthe resistance of the arc. But the resistance of the arc varies enormously withthe temperature of the gaseous column, being practically infinite when the gasbetween the electrodes is cold. The persistence of the arc, therefore, dependson the inability of the column to cool. It is for this reason impossible tomaintain an arc with the current alternating only a few times a second. On theother hand, with a practically continuous current, the arc is easily maintained,the column being constantly kept at a high temperature and low resistance. Thehigher the frequency the smaller the time interval during which the arc may cooland increase considerably in resistance. With a frequency of 10,000 per secondor more in an arc of equal size excessively small variations of temperature aresuperimposed upon a steady temperature, like ripples on the surface of a deepsea. The heating effect is practically continuous and the arc behaves like oneproduced by a continuous current, with the exception, however, that it may notbe quite as easily started, and that the electrodes are equally consumed; thoughthe writer has observed some irregularities in this respect.The second cause alluded to, which possibly may not be present, is due to thetendency of a machine of such high frequency to maintain a practically constantcurrent. When the arc is lengthened, the electromotive force rises in proportionand the arc appears to be more persistent.Such a machine is eminently adapted to maintain a constant current, but it isvery unfit for a constant potential. As a matter of fact, in certain types ofsuch machines a nearly constant current is an almost unavoidable result. As thenumber of poles or polar projections is greatly increased, the clearance becomesof great importance. One has really to do with a great number of very smallmachines. Then there is the impedance in the armature, enormously augmented bythe high frequency. Then, again, the magnetic leakage is facilitated. If thereare three or four hundred alternate poles, the leakage is so great that it isvirtually the same as connecting, in a two-pole machine, the poles by a piece ofiron. This disadvantage, it is true, may be obviated more or less by using afield throughout of the same polarity, but then one encounters difficulties of adifferent nature. All these things tend to maintain a constant current in thearmature circuit.In this connection it is interesting to notice that even today engineers areastonished at the performance of a constant current machine, just as, some yearsago, they used to consider it an extraordinary performance if a machine wascapable of maintaining a constant potential difference between the terminals.Yet one result is just as easily secured as the other. It must only beremembered that in an inductive apparatus of any kind, if constant potential isrequired, the inductive relation between the primary or exciting and secondaryor armature circuit must be the closest possible; whereas, in an apparatus forconstant current just the opposite is required. Furthermore, the opposition tothe current’s flow in the induced circuit must be as small as possible in theformer and as great as possible in the latter case. But opposition to acurrent’s flow may be caused in more than one way. It may be caused by ohmicresistance or self-induction. One may make the induced circuit of a dynamomachine or transformer of such high resistance that when operating devices ofconsiderably smaller resistance within very wide limits a nearly constantcurrent is maintained. But such high resistance involves a great loss in power,hence it is not practicable. Not so self-induction. Self-induction does notnecessarily mean loss of power. The moral is, use self-induction instead ofresistance. There is, however, a circumstance which favors the adoption of thisplan, and this is, that a very high self-induction may be obtained cheaply bysurrounding a comparatively small length of wire more or less completely withiron, and, furthermore, the effect may be exalted at will by causing a rapidundulation of the current. To sum up, the requirements for constant current are:Weak magnetic connection between the induced and inducing circuits, greatestpossible self-induction with the least resistance, greatest practicable rate ofchange of the current. Constant potential, on the other hand, requires: Closestmagnetic connection between the circuits, steady induced current, and, ifpossible, no reaction. If the latter conditions could be fully satisfied in aconstant potential machine, its output would surpass many times that of amachine primarily designed to give constant current. Unfortunately, the type ofmachine in which these conditions may be satisfied is of little practical value,owing to the small electromotive force obtainable and the difficulties in takingoff the current.With their keen inventor’s instinct, the now successful arc-light men have earlyrecognized the desiderata of a constant current machine. Their arc lightmachines have weak fields, large armatures, with a great length of copper wireand few commutator segments to produce great variations in the current’sstrength and to bring self-induction into play. Such machines may maintainwithin considerable limits of variation in the resistance of the circuit apractically constant current. Their output is of course correspondinglydiminished, and, perhaps with the object in view not to cut down the output toomuch, a simple device compensating exceptional variations is employed. Theundulation of the current is almost essential to the commercial success of anarc-light system. It introduces in the circuit a steadying element taking theplace of a large ohmic resistance, without involving a great loss in power, and,what is more important, it allows the use of simple clutch lamps, which with acurrent of a certain number of impulses per second, best suitable for eachparticular lamp, will, if properly attended to, regulate even better than thefinest clock-work lamps. This discovery has been made by the writer—severalyears too late.It has been asserted by competent English electricians that in aconstant-current machine or transformer the regulation is effected by varyingthe phase of the secondary current. That this view is erroneous may be easilyproved by using, instead of lamps, devices each possessing self-induction andcapacity or self-induction and resistance—that is, retarding and acceleratingcomponents—in such proportions as to not affect materially the phase of thesecondary current. Any number of such devices may be inserted or cut out, stillit will be found that the regulation occurs, a constant current beingmaintained, while the electromotive force is varied with the number of thedevices. The change of phase of the secondary current is simply a resultfollowing from the changes in resistance, and, though secondary reaction isalways of more or less importance, yet the real cause of the regulation lies inthe existence of the conditions above enumerated. It should be stated, however,that in the case of a machine the above remarks are to be restricted to thecases in which the machine is independently excited. If the excitation beeffected by commutating the armature current, then the fixed position of thebrushes makes any shifting of the neutral line of the utmost importance, and itmay not be thought immodest of the writer to mention that, as far as records go,he seems to have been the first who has successfully regulated machines byproviding a bridge connection between a point of the external circuit and thecommutator by means of a third brush. The armature and field being properlyproportioned and the brushes placed in their determined positions, a constantcurrent or constant potential resulted from the shifting of the diameter ofcommutation by the varying loads.In connection with machines of such high frequencies, the condenser affords anespecially interesting study. It is easy to raise the electromotive force ofsuch a machine to four or five times the value by simply connecting thecondenser to the circuit, and the writer has continually used the condenser forthe purposes of regulation, as suggested by Blakesley in his book on alternatecurrents, in which he has treated the most frequently occurring condenserproblems with exquisite simplicity and clearness. The high frequency allows theuse of small capacities and renders investigation easy. But, although in most ofthe experiments the result may be foretold, some phenomena observed seem atfirst curious. One experiment performed three or four months ago with such amachine and a condenser may serve as an illustration. A machine was used givingabout 20,000 alternations per second. Two bare wires about twenty feet long andtwo millimeters in diameter, in close proximity to each other, were connected tothe terminals of the machine at the one end, and to a condenser at the other. Asmall transformer without an iron core, of course, was used to bring the readingwithin range of a Cardew voltmeter by connecting the voltmeter to the secondary.On the terminals of the condenser the electromotive force was about 120 volts,and from there inch by inch it gradually fell until at the terminals of themachine it was about 65 volts. It was virtually as though the condenser were agenerator, and the line and armature circuit simply a resistance connected toit. The writer looked for a case of resonance, but he was unable to augment theeffect by varying the capacity very carefully and gradually or by changing thespeed of the machine. A case of pure resonance he was unable to obtain. When acondenser was connected to the terminals of the machine—the self-induction ofthe armature being first determined in the maximum and minimum position and themean value taken—the capacity which gave the highest electromotive forcecorresponded most nearly to that which just counteracted the self-induction withthe existing frequency. If the capacity was increased or diminished, theelectromotive force fell as expected.With frequencies as high as the above mentioned, the condenser effects are ofenormous importance. The condenser becomes a highly efficient apparatus capableof transferring considerable energy.images [images/img_p397.jpg]In an appendix to this book will be found a description of the Tesla oscillator,which its inventor believes will among other great advantages give him thenecessary high frequency conditions, while relieving him of the inconveniencesthat attach to generators of the type described at the beginning of thischapter.______________________* It is thought necessary to remark that, although the induction coil may givequite a good result when operated with such rapidly alternating currents, yetits construction, quite irrespective of the iron core, makes it very unfit forsuch high frequencies, and to obtain the best results the construction should begreatly modified."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXX [05_Contents.xhtml#r33]ALTERNATE CURRENT ELECTROSTATICINDUCTION APPARATUS [05_Contents.xhtml#r33]*About a year and a half ago while engaged in the study of alternate currents ofshort period, it occurred to me that such currents could be obtained by rotatingcharged surfaces in close proximity to conductors. Accordingly I devised variousforms of experimental apparatus of which two are illustrated in the accompanyingengravings.In the apparatus shown in Fig. 208, A is a ring of dry shellacked hard woodprovided on its inside with two sets of tinfoil coatings, a and b, all the acoatings and all the b coatings being connected together, respectively, butindependent from each other. These two sets of coatings are connected to twoterminals, T. For the sake of clearness only a few coatings are shown. Inside ofthe ring A, and in close proximity to it there is arranged to rotate a cylinderB, likewise of dry, shellacked hard wood, and provided with two similar sets ofcoatings, a1 and b1, all the coatings a1 being connected to one ring and all theothers, b1, to another marked + and —. These two sets, a1 and b1 are charged toa high potential by a Holtz or Wimshurst machine, and may be connected to a jarof some capacity. The inside of ring A is coated with mica in order to increasethe induction and also to allow higher potentials to be used.images [images/fig208.jpg]FIG. 208.When the cylinder B with the charged coatings is rotated, a circuit connected tothe terminals T is traversed by alternating currents. Another form of apparatusis illustrated in Fig. 209. In this apparatus the two sets of tinfoil coatingsare glued on a plate of ebonite, and a similar plate which is rotated, and thecoatings of which are charged as in Fig. 208, is provided.images [images/fig209.jpg]FIG. 209.The output of such an apparatus is very small, but some of the effects peculiarto alternating currents of short periods may be observed. The effects, however,cannot be compared with those obtainable with an induction coil which isoperated by an alternate current machine of high frequency, some of which weredescribed by me a short while ago.______________________* Article by Mr. Tesla in The Electrical Engineer, N.Y., May 6, 1891."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXXI [05_Contents.xhtml#r34]“MASSAGE” WITH CURRENTS OF HIGH FREQUENCY [05_Contents.xhtml#r34]*I trust that the present brief communication will not be interpreted as aneffort on my part to put myself on record as a “patent medicine” man, for aserious worker cannot despise anything more than the misuse and abuse ofelectricity which we have frequent occasion to witness. My remarks are elicitedby the lively interest which prominent medical practitioners evince at everyreal advance in electrical investigation. The progress in recent years has beenso great that every electrician and electrical engineer is confident thatelectricity will become the means of accomplishing many things that have beenheretofore, with our existing knowledge, deemed impossible. No wonder then thatprogressive physicians also should expect to find in it a powerful tool and helpin new curative processes. Since I had the honor to bring before the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers some results in utilizing alternating currentsof high tension, I have received many letters from noted physicians inquiring asto the physical effects of such currents of high frequency. It may be rememberedthat I then demonstrated that a body perfectly well insulated in air can beheated by simply connecting it with a source of rapidly alternating highpotential. The heating in this case is due in all probability to the bombardmentof the body by air, or possibly by some other medium, which is molecular oratomic in construction, and the presence of which has so far escaped ouranalysis—for according to my ideas, the true ether radiation with suchfrequencies as even a few millions per second must be very small. This body maybe a good conductor or it may be a very poor conductor of electricity withlittle change in the result. The human body is, in such a case, a fineconductor, and if a person insulated in a room, or no matter where, is broughtinto contact with such a source of rapidly alternating high potential, the skinis heated by bombardment. It is a mere question of the dimensions and characterof the apparatus to produce any degree of heating desired.It has occurred to me whether, with such apparatus properly prepared, it wouldnot be possible for a skilled physician to find in it a means for the effectivetreatment of various types of disease. The heating will, of course, besuperficial, that is, on the skin, and would result, whether the person operatedon were in bed or walking around a room, whether dressed in thick clothes orwhether reduced to nakedness. In fact, to put it broadly, it is conceivable thata person entirely nude at the North Pole might keep himself comfortably warm inthis manner.Without vouching for all the results, which must, of course, be determined byexperience and observation, I can at least warrant the fact that heating wouldoccur by the use of this method of subjecting the human body to bombardment byalternating currents of high potential and frequency such I have long workedwith. It is only reasonable to expect that some of the novel effects will bewholly different from those obtainable with the old familiar therapeutic methodsgenerally used. Whether they would all be beneficial or not remains to beproved.______________________* Article by Mr. Tesla in The Electrical Engineer of Dec. 23d, 1891."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXXII [05_Contents.xhtml#r35]ELECTRIC DISCHARGE IN VACUUM TUBES [05_Contents.xhtml#r35]*In The Electrical Engineer of June 10 I have noted the description of someexperiments of Prof. J. J. Thomson, on the “Electric Discharge in Vacuum Tubes,”and in your issue of June 24 Prof. Elihu Thomson describes an experiment of thesame kind. The fundamental idea in these experiments is to set up anelectromotive force in a vacuum tube—preferably devoid of any electrodes—bymeans of electro-magnetic induction, and to excite the tube in this manner.As I view the subject I should think that to any experimenter who had carefullystudied the problem confronting us and who attempted to find a solution of it,this idea must present itself as naturally as, for instance, the idea ofreplacing the tinfoil coatings of a Leyden jar by rarefied gas and excitingluminosity in the condenser thus obtained by repeatedly charging and dischargingit. The idea being obvious, whatever merit there is in this line ofinvestigation must depend upon the completeness of the study of the subject andthe correctness of the observations. The following lines are not penned with anydesire on my part to put myself on record as one who has performed similarexperiments, but with a desire to assist other experimenters by pointing outcertain peculiarities of the phenomena observed, which, to all appearances, havenot been noted by Prof. J. J. Thomson, who, however, seems to have gone aboutsystematically in his investigations, and who has been the first to make hisresults known. These peculiarities noted by me would seem to be at variance withthe views of Prof. J. J. Thomson, and present the phenomena in a differentlight.My investigations in this line occupied me principally during the winter andspring of the past year. During this time many different experiments wereperformed, and in my exchanges of ideas on this subject with Mr. Alfred S.Brown, of the Western Union Telegraph Company, various different dispositionswere suggested which were carried out by me in practice. Fig. 210 may serve asan example of one of the many forms of apparatus used. This consisted of a largeglass tube sealed at one end and projecting into an ordinary incandescent lampbulb. The primary, usually consisting of a few turns of thick, well-insulatedcopper sheet was inserted within the tube, the inside space of the bulbfurnishing the secondary. This form of apparatus was arrived at after someexperimenting, and was used principally with the view of enabling me to place apolished reflecting surface on the inside of the tube, and for this purpose thelast turn of the primary was covered with a thin silver sheet. In all forms ofapparatus used there was no special difficulty in exciting a luminous circle orcylinder in proximity to the primary.images [images/fig210.jpg]FIG. 210.As to the number of turns, I cannot quite understand why Prof. J. J. Thomsonshould think that a few turns were “quite sufficient,” but lest I should imputeto him an opinion he may not have, I will add that I have gained this impressionfrom the reading of the published abstracts of his lecture. Clearly, the numberof turns which gives the best result in any case, is dependent on the dimensionsof the apparatus, and, were it not for various considerations, one turn wouldalways give the best result.I have found that it is preferable to use in these experiments an alternatecurrent machine giving a moderate number of alternations per second to excitethe induction coil for charging the Leyden jar which discharges through theprimary—shown diagrammatically in Fig. 211—as in such case, before thedisruptive discharge takes place, the tube or bulb is slightly excited and theformation of the luminous circle is decidedly facilitated. But I have also useda Wimshurst machine in some experiments.images [images/fig211.jpg]FIG. 211.Prof. J. J. Thomson’s view of the phenomena under consideration seems to be thatthey are wholly due to electro-magnetic action. I was, at one time, of the sameopinion, but upon carefully investigating the subject I was led to theconviction that they are more of an electrostatic nature. It must be rememberedthat in these experiments we have to deal with primary currents of an enormousfrequency or rate of change and of high potential, and that the secondaryconductor consists of a rarefied gas, and that under such conditionselectrostatic effects must play an important part.In support of my view I will describe a few experiments made by me. To exciteluminosity in the tube it is not absolutely necessary that the conductor shouldbe closed. For instance, if an ordinary exhausted tube (preferably of largediameter) be surrounded by a spiral of thick copper wire serving as the primary,a feebly luminous spiral may be induced in the tube, roughly shown in Fig. 212.In one of these experiments a curious phenomenon was observed; namely, twointensely luminous circles, each of them close to a turn of the primary spiral,were formed inside of the tube, and I attributed this phenomenon to theexistence of nodes on the primary. The circles were connected by a faintluminous spiral parallel to the primary and in close proximity to it. To producethis effect I have found it necessary to strain the jar to the utmost. The turnsof the spiral tend to close and form circles, but this, of course, would beexpected, and does not necessarily indicate an electro-magnetic effect; whereasthe fact that a glow can be produced along the primary in the form of an openspiral argues for an electrostatic effect.images [images/fig212.jpg]FIG. 212.In using Dr. Lodge’s recoil circuit, the electrostatic action is likewiseapparent. The arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 213. In his experiment twohollow exhausted tubes H H were slipped over the wires of the recoil circuit andupon discharging the jar in the usual manner luminosity was excited in thetubes.images [images/fig213.jpg]FIG. 213.Another experiment performed is illustrated in Fig. 214. In this case anordinary lamp-bulb was surrounded by one or two turns of thick copper wire P andthe luminous circle L excited in the bulb by discharging the jar through theprimary. The lamp-bulb was provided with a tinfoil coating on the side oppositeto the primary and each time the tinfoil coating was connected to the ground orto a large object the luminosity of the circle was considerably increased. Thiswas evidently due to electrostatic action.images [images/fig214.jpg]FIG. 214.In other experiments I have noted that when the primary touches the glass theluminous circle is easier produced and is more sharply defined; but I have notnoted that, generally speaking, the circles induced were very sharply defined,as Prof. J. J. Thomson has observed; on the contrary, in my experiments theywere broad and often the whole of the bulb or tube was illuminated; and in onecase I have observed an intensely purplish glow, to which Prof. J. J. Thomsonrefers. But the circles were always in close proximity to the primary and wereconsiderably easier produced when the latter was very close to the glass, muchmore so than would be expected assuming the action to be electromagnetic andconsidering the distance; and these facts speak for an electrostatic effect.Furthermore I have observed that there is a molecular bombardment in the planeof the luminous circle at right angles to the glass—supposing the circle to bein the plane of the primary—this bombardment being evident from the rapidheating of the glass near the primary. Were the bombardment not at right anglesto the glass the heating could not be so rapid. If there is a circumferentialmovement of the molecules constituting the luminous circle, I have thought thatit might be rendered manifest by placing within the tube or bulb, radially tothe circle, a thin plate of mica coated with some phosphorescent material andanother such plate tangentially to the circle. If the molecules would movecircumferentially, the former plate would be rendered more intenselyphosphorescent. For want of time I have, however, not been able to perform theexperiment.Another observation made by me was that when the specific inductive capacity ofthe medium between the primary and secondary is increased, the inductive effectis augmented. This is roughly illustrated in Fig. 215. In this case luminositywas excited in an exhausted tube or bulb B and a glass tube T slipped betweenthe primary and the bulb, when the effect pointed out was noted. Were the actionwholly electromagnetic no change could possibly have been observed.images [images/fig215.jpg]FIG. 215.I have likewise noted that when a bulb is surrounded by a wire closed uponitself and in the plane of the primary, the formation of the luminous circlewithin the bulb is not prevented. But if instead of the wire a broad strip oftinfoil is glued upon the bulb, the formation of the luminous band wasprevented, because then the action was distributed over a greater surface. Theeffect of the closed tinfoil was no doubt of an electrostatic nature, for itpresented a much greater resistance than the closed wire and produced thereforea much smaller electromagnetic effect.Some of the experiments of Prof. J. J. Thomson also would seem to show someelectrostatic action. For instance, in the experiment with the bulb enclosed ina bell jar, I should think that when the latter is exhausted so far that the gasenclosed reaches the maximum conductivity, the formation of the circle in thebulb and jar is prevented because of the space surrounding the primary beinghighly conducting; when the jar is further exhausted, the conductivity of thespace around the primary diminishes and the circles appear necessarily first inthe bell jar, as the rarefied gas is nearer to the primary. But were theinductive effect very powerful, they would probably appear in the bulb also. If,however, the bell jar were exhausted to the highest degree they would verylikely show themselves in the bulb only, that is, supposing the vacuous space tobe non-conducting. On the assumption that in these phenomena electrostaticactions are concerned we find it easily explicable why the introduction ofmercury or the heating of the bulb prevents the formation of the luminous bandor shortens the after-glow; and also why in some cases a platinum wire mayprevent the excitation of the tube. Nevertheless some of the experiments ofProf. J. J. Thomson would seem to indicate an electromagnetic effect. I may addthat in one of my experiments in which a vacuum was produced by the Torricellianmethod, I was unable to produce the luminous band, but this may have been due tothe weak exciting current employed.My principal argument is the following: I have experimentally proved that if thesame discharge which is barely sufficient to excite a luminous band in the bulbwhen passed through the primary circuit be so directed as to exalt theelectrostatic inductive effect—namely, by converting upwards—an exhausted tube,devoid of electrodes, may be excited at a distance of several feet.SOME EXPERIMENTS ON THE ELECTRIC DISCHARGE IN VACUUM TUBES*BY PROF. J. J. THOMSON, M.A., F.R.S.> The phenomena of vacuum discharges were, Prof. Thomson said, greatly> simplified when their path was wholly gaseous, the complication of the dark> space surrounding the negative electrode, and the stratifications so commonly> observed in ordinary vacuum tubes, being absent. To produce discharges in> tubes devoid of electrodes was, however, not easy to accomplish, for the only> available means of producing an electromotive force in the discharge circuit> was by electro-magnetic induction. Ordinary methods of producing variable> induction were valueless, and recourse was had to the oscillatory discharge of> a Leyden jar, which combines the two essentials of a current whose maximum> value is enormous, and whose rapidity of alternation is immensely great. The> discharge circuits, which may take the shape of bulbs, or of tubes bent in the> form of coils, were placed in close proximity to glass tubes filled with> mercury, which formed the path of the oscillatory discharge. The parts thus> corresponded to the windings of an induction coil, the vacuum tubes being the> secondary, and the tubes filled with mercury the primary. In such an apparatus> the Leyden jar need not be large, and neither primary nor secondary need have> many turns, for this would increase the self-induction of the former, and> lengthen the discharge path in the latter. Increasing the self-induction of> the primary reduces the E. M. F. induced in the secondary, whilst lengthening> the secondary does not increase the E. M. F. per unit length. The two or three> turns, as shown in Fig. 216, in each, were found to be quite sufficient, and,> on discharging the Leyden jar between two highly polished knobs in the primary> circuit, a plain uniform band of light was seen to pass round the secondary.> An exhausted bulb, Fig. 217, containing traces of oxygen was placed within a> primary spiral of three turns, and, on passing the jar discharge, a circle of> light was seen within the bulb in close proximity to the primary circuit,> accompanied by a purplish glow, which lasted for a second or more. On heating> the bulb, the duration of the glow was greatly diminished, and it could be> instantly extinguished by the presence of an electro-magnet. Another exhausted> bulb, Fig. 218, surrounded by a primary spiral, was contained in a bell-jar,> and when the pressure of air in the jar was about that of the atmosphere, the> secondary discharge occurred in the bulb, as is ordinarily the case. On> exhausting the jar, however, the luminous discharge grew fainter, and a point> was reached at which no secondary discharge was visible. Further exhaustion of> the jar caused the secondary discharge to appear outside of the bulb. The fact> of obtaining no luminous discharge, either in the bulb or jar, the author> could only explain on two suppositions, viz.: that under the conditions then> existing the specific inductive capacity of the gas was very great, or that a> discharge could pass without being luminous. The author had also observed that> the conductivity of a vacuum tube without electrodes increased as the pressure> diminished, until a certain point was reached, and afterwards diminished> again, thus showing that the high resistance of a nearly perfect vacuum is in> no way due to the presence of the electrodes. One peculiarity of the> discharges was their local nature, the rings of light being much more sharply> defined than was to be expected.

J.Thomson, which appeared originally in the London Electrician and which have abearing upon some experiments described by me in your issue of July 1.I did not, as Prof. J. J. Thomson seems to believe, misunderstand his positionin regard to the cause of the phenomena considered, but I thought that in hisexperiments, as well as in my own, electrostatic effects were of greatimportance. It did not appear, from the meagre description of his experiments,that all possible precautions had been taken to exclude these effects. I did notdoubt that luminosity could be excited in a closed tube when electrostaticaction is completely excluded. In fact, at the outset, I myself looked for apurely electrodynamic effect and believed that I had obtained it. But manyexperiments performed at that time proved to me that the electrostatic effectswere generally of far greater importance, and admitted of a more satisfactoryexplanation of most of the phenomena observed.In using the term electrostatic I had reference rather to the nature of theaction than to a stationary condition, which is the usual acceptance of theterm. To express myself more clearly, I will suppose that near a closedexhausted tube be placed a small sphere charged to a very high potential. Thesphere would act inductively upon the tube, and by distributing electricity overthe same would undoubtedly produce luminosity (if the potential be sufficientlyhigh), until a permanent condition would be reached. Assuming the tube to beperfectly well insulated, there would be only one instantaneous flash during theact of distribution. This would be due to the electrostatic action simply.But now, suppose the charged sphere to be moved at short intervals with greatspeed along the exhausted tube. The tube would now be permanently excited, asthe moving sphere would cause a constant redistribution of electricity andcollisions of the molecules of the rarefied gas. We would still have to dealwith an electrostatic effect, and in addition an electrodynamic effect would beobserved. But if it were found that, for instance, the effect produced dependedmore on the specific inductive capacity than on the magnetic permeability of themedium—which would certainly be the case for speeds incomparably lower than thatof light—then I believe I would be justified in saying that the effect producedwas more of an electrostatic nature. I do not mean to say, however, that anysimilar condition prevails in the case of the discharge of a Leyden jar throughthe primary, but I think that such an action would be desirable.It is in the spirit of the above example that I used the terms “more of anelectrostatic nature,” and have investigated the influence of bodies of highspecific inductive capacity, and observed, for instance, the importance of thequality of glass of which the tube is made. I also endeavored to ascertain theinfluence of a medium of high permeability by using oxygen. It appeared fromrough estimation that an oxygen tube when excited under similar conditions—thatis, as far as could be determined—gives more light; but this, of course, may bedue to many causes.Without doubting in the least that, with the care and precautions taken by Prof.J. J. Thomson, the luminosity excited was due solely to electrodynamic action, Iwould say that in many experiments I have observed curious instances of theineffectiveness of the screening, and I have also found that the electrificationthrough the air is often of very great importance, and may, in some cases,determine the excitation of the tube.In his original communication to the Electrician, Prof. J. J. Thomson refers tothe fact that the luminosity in a tube near a wire through which a Leyden jarwas discharged was noted by Hittorf. I think that the feeble luminous effectreferred to has been noted by many experimenters, but in my experiments theeffects were much more powerful than those usually noted.The following is the communication* referred to:> “Mr. Tesla seems to ascribe the effects he observed to electrostatic action,> and I have no doubt, from the description he gives of his method of conducting> his experiments, that in them electrostatic action plays a very important> part. He seems, however, to have misunderstood my position with respect to the> cause of these discharges, which is not, as he implies, that luminosity in> tubes without electrodes cannot be produced by electrostatic action, but that> it can also be produced when this action is excluded. As a matter of fact, it> is very much easier to get the luminosity when these electrostatic effects are> operative than when they are not. As an illustration of this I may mention> that the first experiment I tried with the discharge of a Leyden jar produced> luminosity in the tube, but it was not until after six weeks’ continuous> experimenting that I was able to get a discharge in the exhausted tube which I> was satisfied was due to what is ordinarily called electrodynamic action. It> is advisable to have a clear idea of what we mean by electrostatic action. If,> previous to the discharge of the jar, the primary coil is raised to a high> potential, it will induce over the glass of the tube a distribution of> electricity. When the potential of the primary suddenly falls, this> electrification will redistribute itself, and may pass through the rarefied> gas and produce luminosity in doing so. Whilst the discharge of the jar is> going on, it is difficult, and, from a theoretical point of view, undesirable,> to separate the effect into parts, one of which is called electrostatic, the> other electromagnetic; what we can prove is that in this case the discharge is> not such as would be produced by electromotive forces derived from a potential> function. In my experiments the primary coil was connected to earth, and, as a> further precaution, the primary was separated from the discharge tube by a> screen of blotting paper, moistened with dilute sulphuric acid, and connected> to earth. Wet blotting paper is a sufficiently good conductor to screen off a> stationary electrostatic effect, though it is not a good enough one to stop> waves of alternating electromotive intensity. When showing the experiments to> the Physical Society I could not, of course, keep the tubes covered up, but,> unless my memory deceives me, I stated the precautions which had been taken> against the electrostatic effect. To correct misapprehension I may state that> I did not read a formal paper to the Society, my object being to exhibit a few> of the most typical experiments.

Selecting, then, any circuit through which is flowing an alternatingcurrent, Mr. Tesla divides such circuit at any desired point into two branchesor paths. In one of these paths he inserts some device to create anelectromotive force counter to the waves or impulses of current of one sign anda similar device in the other branch which opposes the waves of opposite sign.Assume, for example, that these devices are batteries, primary or secondary, orcontinuous current dynamo machines. The waves or impulses of opposite directioncomposing the main current have a natural tendency to divide between the twobranches; but by reason of the opposite electrical character or effect of thetwo branches, one will offer an easy passage to a current of a certaindirection, while the other will offer a relatively high resistance to thepassage of the same current. The result of this disposition is, that the wavesof current of one sign will, partly or wholly, pass over one of the paths orbranches, while those of the opposite sign pass over the other. There may thusbe obtained from an alternating current two or more direct currents without theemployment of any commutator such as it has been heretofore regarded asnecessary to use. The current in either branch may be used in the same way andfor the same purposes as any other direct current—that is, it may be made tocharge secondary batteries, energize electro-magnets, or for any other analogouspurpose.Fig. 220 represents a plan of directing the alternating currents by means ofdevices purely electrical in character. Figs. 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, and 226are diagrams illustrative of other ways of carrying out the invention.images [images/fig220.jpg]FIG. 220.images [images/fig221.jpg]FIG. 221.images [images/fig222.jpg]FIG. 222.images [images/fig223.jpg]FIG. 223.images [images/fig224.jpg]FIG. 224.images [images/fig225.jpg]FIG. 225.images [images/fig226.jpg]FIG. 226.In Fig. 220, A designates a generator of alternating currents, and B B the mainor line circuit therefrom. At any given point in this circuit at or near whichit is desired to obtain direct currents, the circuit B is divided into two pathsor branches C D. In each of these branches is placed an electrical generator,which for the present we will assume produces direct or continuous currents. Thedirection of the current thus produced is opposite in one branch to that of thecurrent in the other branch, or, considering the two branches as forming aclosed circuit, the generators E F are connected up in series therein, onegenerator in each part or half of the circuit. The electromotive force of thecurrent sources E and F may be equal to or higher or lower than theelectromotive forces in the branches C D, or between the points X and Y of thecircuit B B. If equal, it is evident that current waves of one sign will beopposed in one branch and assisted in the other to such an extent that all thewaves of one sign will pass over one branch and those of opposite sign over theother. If, on the other hand, the electromotive force of the sources E F belower than that between X and Y, the currents in both branches will bealternating, but the waves of one sign will preponderate. One of the generatorsor sources of current E or F may be dispensed with; but it is preferable toemploy both, if they offer an appreciable resistance, as the two branches willbe thereby better balanced. The translating or other devices to be acted upon bythe current are designated by the letters G, and they are inserted in thebranches C D in any desired manner; but in order to better preserve an evenbalance between the branches due regard should, of course, be had to the numberand character of the devices.Figs. 221, 222, 223, and 224 illustrate what may termed “electromagnetic”devices for accomplishing a similar result—that is to say, instead of producingdirectly by a generator an electromotive force in each branch of the circuit,Mr. Tesla establishes a field or fields of force and leads the branches throughthe same in such manner that an active opposition of opposite effect ordirection will be developed therein by the passage, or tendency to pass, of thealternations of current. In Fig. 221, for example, A is the generator ofalternating currents, B B the line circuit, and C D the branches over which thealternating currents are directed. In each branch is included the secondary of atransformer or induction coil, which, since they correspond in their functionsto the batteries of the previous figure, are designated by the letters E F. Theprimaries H H′ of the induction coils or transformers are connected either inparallel or series with a source of direct or continuous currents I, and thenumber of convolutions is so calculated for the strength of the current from Ithat the cores J J′ will be saturated. The connections are such that theconditions in the two transformers are of opposite character—that is to say, thearrangement is such that a current wave or impulse corresponding in directionwith that of the direct current in one primary, as H, is of opposite directionto that in the other primary H′. It thus results that while one secondary offersa resistance or opposition to the passage through it of a wave of one sign, theother secondary similarly opposes a wave of opposite sign. In consequence, thewaves of one sign will, to a greater or less extent, pass by way of one branch,while those of opposite sign in like manner pass over the other branch.In lieu of saturating the primaries by a source of continuous current, we mayinclude the primaries in the branches C D, respectively, and periodicallyshort-circuit by any suitable mechanical devices—such as an ordinary revolvingcommutator—their secondaries. It will be understood, of course, that therotation and action of the commutator must be in synchronism or in proper accordwith the periods of the alternations in order to secure the desired results.Such a disposition is represented diagrammatically in Fig. 222. Corresponding tothe previous figures, A is the generator of alternating currents, B B the line,and C D the two branches for the direct currents. In branch C are included twoprimary coils E E′, and in branch D are two similar primaries F F′. Thecorresponding secondaries for these coils and which are on the same subdividedcores J or J′, are in circuits the terminals of which connect to oppositesegments K K′, and L L′, respectively, of a commutator. Brushes b b bear uponthe commutator and alternately short-circuit the plates K and K′, and L and L′,through a connection c. It is obvious that either the magnets and commutator, orthe brushes, may revolve.The operation will be understood from a consideration of the effects of closingor short-circuiting the secondaries. For example, if at the instant when a givenwave of current passes, one set of secondaries be short-circuited, nearly allthe current flows through the corresponding primaries; but the secondaries ofthe other branch being open-circuited, the self-induction in the primaries ishighest, and hence little or no current will pass through that branch. If, asthe current alternates, the secondaries of the two branches are alternatelyshort-circuited, the result will be that the currents of one sign pass over onebranch and those of the opposite sign over the other. The disadvantages of thisarrangement, which would seem to result from the employment of sliding contacts,are in reality very slight, inasmuch as the electromotive force of thesecondaries may be made exceedingly low, so that sparking at the brushes isavoided.Fig. 223 is a diagram, partly in section, of another plan of carrying out theinvention. The circuit B in this case is divided, as before, and each branchincludes the coils of both the fields and revolving armatures of two inductiondevices. The armatures O P are preferably mounted on the same shaft, and areadjusted relatively to one another in such manner that when the self-inductionin one branch, as C, is maximum, in the other branch D it is minimum. Thearmatures are rotated in synchronism with the alternations from the source A.The winding or position of the armature coils is such that a current in a givendirection passed through both armatures would establish in one, poles similar tothose in the adjacent poles of the field, and in the other, poles unlike theadjacent field poles, as indicated by n n s s in the diagram. If the like polesare presented, as shown in circuit D, the condition is that of a closedsecondary upon a primary, or the position of least inductive resistance; hence agiven alternation of current will pass mainly through D. A half revolution ofthe armatures produces an opposite effect and the succeeding current impulsepasses through C. Using this figure as an illustration, it is evident that thefields N M may be permanent magnets or independently excited and the armatures OP driven, as in the present case, so as to produce alternate currents, whichwill set up alternately impulses of opposite direction in the two branches D C,which in such case would include the armature circuits and translating devicesonly.In Fig. 224 a plan alternative with that shown in Fig. 222 is illustrated. Inthe previous case illustrated, each branch C and D contained one or more primarycoils, the secondaries of which were periodically short circuited in synchronismwith the alternations of current from the main source A, and for this purpose acommutator was employed. The latter may, however, be dispensed with and anarmature with a closed coil substituted.Referring to Fig. 224 in one of the branches, as C, are two coils M′, wound onlaminated cores, and in the other branches D are similar coils N′. A subdividedor laminated armature O′, carrying a closed coil R′, is rotatably supportedbetween the coils M′ N′, as shown. In the position shown—that is, with the coilR′ parallel with the convolutions of the primaries N′ M′—practically the wholecurrent will pass through branch D, because the self-induction in coils M′ M′ ismaximum. If, therefore, the armature and coil be rotated at a proper speedrelatively to the periods or alternations of the source A, the same results areobtained as in the case of Fig. 222.Fig. 225 is an instance of what may be called, in distinction to the others, a“magnetic” means of securing the result. V and W are two strong permanentmagnets provided with armatures V′ W′, respectively. The armatures are made ofthin laminae of soft iron or steel, and the amount of magnetic metal which theycontain is so calculated that they will be fully or nearly saturated by themagnets. Around the armatures are coils E F, contained, respectively, in thecircuits C and D. The connections and electrical conditions in this case aresimilar to those in Fig. 221, except that the current source of I, Fig. 221, isdispensed with and the saturation of the core of coils E F obtained from thepermanent magnets.The previous illustrations have all shown the two branches or paths containingthe translating or induction devices as in derivation one to the other; but thisis not always necessary. For example, in Fig. 226, A is an alternating-currentgenerator; B B, the line wires or circuit. At any given point in the circuit letus form two paths, as D D′, and at another point two paths, as C C′. Either pairor group of paths is similar to the previous dispositions with the electricalsource or induction device in one branch only, while the two groups takentogether form the obvious equivalent of the cases in which an induction deviceor generator is included in both branches. In one of the paths, as D, areincluded the devices to be operated by the current. In the other branch, as D′,is an induction device that opposes the current impulses of one direction anddirects them through the branch D. So, also, in branch C are translating devicesG, and in branch C′ an induction device or its equivalent that diverts through Cimpulses of opposite direction to those diverted by the device in branch D′. Thediagram shows a special form of induction device for this purpose. J J′ are thecores, formed with pole-pieces, upon which are wound the coils M N. Betweenthese pole-pieces are mounted at right angles to one another the magneticarmatures O P, preferably mounted on the same shaft and designed to be rotatedin synchronism with the alternations of current. When one of the armatures is inline with the poles or in the position occupied by armature P, the magneticcircuit of the induction device is practically closed; hence there will be thegreatest opposition to the passage of a current through coils N N. Thealternation will therefore pass by way of branch D. At the same time, themagnetic circuit of the other induction device being broken by the position ofthe armature O, there will be less opposition to the current in coils M, whichwill shunt the current from branch C. A reversal of the current being attendedby a shifting of the armatures, the opposite effect is produced.Other modifications of these methods are possible, but need not be pointed out.In all these plans, it will be observed, there is developed in one or all ofthese branches of a circuit from a source of alternating currents, an active (asdistinguished from a dead) resistance or opposition to the currents of one sign,for the purpose of diverting the currents of that sign through the other oranother path, but permitting the currents of opposite sign to pass withoutsubstantial opposition.Whether the division of the currents or waves of current of opposite sign beeffected with absolute precision or not is immaterial, since it will besufficient if the waves are only partially diverted or directed, for in suchcase the preponderating influence in each branch of the circuit of the waves ofone sign secures the same practical results in many if not all respects asthough the current were direct and continuous.An alternating and a direct current have been combined so that the waves of onedirection or sign were partially or wholly overcome by the direct current; butby this plan only one set of alternations are utilized, whereas by the systemjust described the entire current is rendered available. By obvious applicationsof this discovery Mr. Tesla is enabled to produce a self-exciting alternatingdynamo, or to operate direct current meters on alternating-current circuits orto run various devices—such as arc lamps—by direct currents in the same circuitwith incandescent lamps or other devices operated by alternating currents.It will be observed that if an intermittent counter or opposing force bedeveloped in the branches of the circuit and of higher electromotive force thanthat of the generator, an alternating current will result in each branch, withthe waves of one sign preponderating, while a constantly or uniformly actingopposition in the branches of higher electromotive force than the generatorwould produce a pulsating current, which conditions would be, under somecircumstances, the equivalent of those described."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXXIV [05_Contents.xhtml#r38]CONDENSERS WITH PLATES IN OIL [05_Contents.xhtml#r38]In experimenting with currents of high frequency and high potential, Mr. Teslahas found that insulating materials such as glass, mica, and in general thosebodies which possess the highest specific inductive capacity, are inferior asinsulators in such devices when currents of the kind described are employedcompared with those possessing high insulating power, together with a smallerspecific inductive capacity; and he has also found that it is very desirable toexclude all gaseous matter from the apparatus, or any access of the same to theelectrified surfaces, in order to prevent heating by molecular bombardment andthe loss or injury consequent thereon. He has therefore devised a method toaccomplish these results and produce highly efficient and reliable condensers,by using oil as the dielectri.* The plan admits of a particular construction ofcondenser, in which the distance between the plates is adjustable, and of whichhe takes advantage.In the accompanying illustrations, Fig. 227 is a section of a condenserconstructed in accordance with this principle and having stationary plates; andFig. 228 is a similar view of a condenser with adjustable plates.images [images/fig227.jpg]FIG. 227.images [images/fig228.jpg]FIG. 228.Any suitable box or receptacle A may be used to contain the plates or armatures.These latter are designated by B and C and are connected, respectively, toterminals D and E, which pass out through the sides of the case. The platesordinarily are separated by strips of porous insulating material F, which areused merely for the purpose of maintaining them in position. The space withinthe can is filled with oil G. Such a condenser will prove highly efficient andwill not become heated or permanently injured.In many cases it is desirable to vary or adjust the capacity of a condenser, andthis is provided for by securing the plates to adjustable supports—as, forexample, to rods H—passing through stuffing boxes K in the sides of case A andfurnished with nuts L, the ends of the rods being threaded for engagement withthe nuts.It is well known that oils possess insulating properties, and it has been acommon practice to interpose a body of oil between two conductors for purposesof insulation; but Mr. Tesla believes he has discovered peculiar properties inoils which render them very valuable in this particular form of device.______________________* Mr. Tesla’s experiments, as the careful reader of his three lectures willperceive, have revealed a very important fact which is taken advantage of inthis invention. Namely, he has shown that in a condenser a considerable amountof energy may be wasted, and the condenser may break down merely because gaseousmatter is present between the surfaces. A number of experiments are described inthe lectures, which bring out this fact forcibly and serve as a guide in theoperation of high tension apparatus. But besides bearing upon this point, theseexperiments also throw a light upon investigations of a purely scientific natureand explain now the lack of harmony among the observations of variousinvestigators. Mr. Tesla shows that in a fluid such as oil the losses are verysmall as compared with those incurred in a gas."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXXV [05_Contents.xhtml#r39]ELECTROLYTIC REGISTERING METER [05_Contents.xhtml#r39]An ingenious form of electrolytic meter attributable to Mr. Tesla is one inwhich a conductor is immersed in a solution, so arranged that metal may bedeposited from the solution or taken away in such a manner that the electricalresistance of the conductor is varied in a definite proportion to the strengthof the current the energy of which is to be computed, whereby this variation inresistance serves as a measure of the energy and also may actuate registeringmechanism, whenever the resistance rises above or falls below certain limits.In carrying out this idea Mr. Tesla employs an electrolytic cell, through whichextend two conductors parallel and in close proximity to each other. Theseconductors he connects in series through a resistance, but in such manner thatthere is an equal difference of potential between them throughout their entireextent. The free ends or terminals of the conductors are connected either inseries in the circuit supplying the current to the lamps or other devices, or inparallel to a resistance in the circuit and in series with the current consumingdevices. Under such circumstances a current passing through the conductorsestablishes a difference of potential between them which is proportional to thestrength of the current, in consequence of which there is a leakage of currentfrom one conductor to the other across the solution. The strength of thisleakage current is proportional to the difference of potential, and, therefore,in proportion to the strength of the current passing through the conductors.Moreover, as there is a constant difference of potential between the twoconductors throughout the entire extent that is exposed to the solution, thecurrent density through such solution is the same at all corresponding points,and hence the deposit is uniform along the whole of one of the conductors, whilethe metal is taken away uniformly from the other. The resistance of oneconductor is by this means diminished, while that of the other is increased,both in proportion to the strength of the current passing through theconductors. From such variation in the resistance of either or both of theconductors forming the positive and negative electrodes of the cell, the currentenergy expended may be readily computed. Figs. 229 and 230 illustrate two formsof such a meter.images [images/fig229.jpg]FIG. 229.images [images/fig230.jpg]FIG. 230.In Fig. 229 G designates a direct-current generator. L L are the conductors ofthe circuit extending therefrom. A is a tube of glass, the ends of which aresealed, as by means of insulating plugs or caps B B. C C′ are two conductorsextending through the tube A, their ends passing out through the plugs B toterminals thereon. These conductors may be corrugated or formed in other properways to offer the desired electrical resistance. R is a resistance connected inseries with the two conductors C C′, which by their free terminals are connectedup in circuit with one of the conductors L.The method of using this device and computing by means thereof the energy of thecurrent will be readily understood. First, the resistances of the two conductorsC C′, respectively, are accurately measured and noted. Then a known current ispassed through the instrument for a given time, and by a second measurement theincrease and diminution of the resistances of the two conductors arerespectively taken. From these data the constant is obtained—that is to say, forexample, the increase of resistance of one conductor or the diminution of theresistance of the other per lamp hour. These two measurements evidently serve asa check, since the gain of one conductor should equal the loss of the other. Afurther check is afforded by measuring both wires in series with the resistance,in which case the resistance of the whole should remain constant.In Fig. 230 the conductors C C′ are connected in parallel, the current device atX passing in one branch first through a resistance R′ and then through conductorC, while on the other branch it passes first through conductor C′, and thenthrough resistance R″. The resistances R′ R″ are equal, as also are theresistances of the conductors C C′. It is, moreover, preferable that therespective resistances of the conductors C C′ should be a known and convenientfraction of the coils or resistances R′ R″. It will be observed that in thearrangement shown in Fig. 230 there is a constant potential difference betweenthe two conductors C C′ throughout their entire length.It will be seen that in both cases illustrated, the proportionality of theincrease or decrease of resistance to the current strength will always bepreserved, for what one conductor gains the other loses, and the resistances ofthe conductors C C′ being small as compared with the resistances in series withthem. It will be understood that after each measurement or registration of agiven variation of resistance in one or both conductors, the direction of thecurrent should be changed or the instrument reversed, so that the deposit willbe taken from the conductor which has gained and added to that which has lost.This principle is capable of many modifications. For instance, since there is asection of the circuit—to wit, the conductor C or C′—that varies in resistancein proportion to the current strength, such variation may be utilized, as isdone in many analogous cases, to effect the operation of various automaticdevices, such as registers. It is better, however, for the sake of simplicity tocompute the energy by measurements of resistance.The chief advantages of this arrangement are, first, that it is possible to readoff directly the amount of the energy expended by means of a properlyconstructed ohm-meter and without resorting to weighing the deposit; secondly itis not necessary to employ shunts, for the whole of the current to be measuredmay be passed through the instrument; third, the accuracy of the instrument andcorrectness of the indications are but slightly affected by changes intemperature. It is also said that such meters have the merit of superior economyand compactness, as well as of cheapness in construction. Electrolytic metersseem to need every auxiliary advantage to make them permanently popular andsuccessful, no matter how much ingenuity may be shown in their design."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXXVI [05_Contents.xhtml#r40]THERMO-MAGNETIC MOTORS ANDPYRO-MAGNETIC GENERATORS [05_Contents.xhtml#r40]No electrical inventor of the present day dealing with the problems of light andpower considers that he has done himself or his opportunities justice until hehas attacked the subject of thermo-magnetism. As far back as the beginning ofthe seventeenth century it was shown by Dr. William Gilbert, the father ofmodern electricity, that a loadstone or iron bar when heated to redness losesits magnetism; and since that time the influence of heat on the magnetic metalshas been investigated frequently, though not with any material or practicalresult.For a man of Mr. Tesla’s inventive ability, the problems in this field havenaturally had no small fascination, and though he has but glanced at them, it isto be hoped he may find time to pursue the study deeper and further. For such ashe, the investigation must undoubtedly bear fruit. Meanwhile he has worked outone or two operative devices worthy of note.* He obtains mechanical power by areciprocating action resulting from the joint operations of heat, magnetism, anda spring or weight or other force—that is to say he subjects a body magnetizedby induction or otherwise to the action of heat until the magnetism issufficiently neutralized to allow a weight or spring to give motion to the bodyand lessen the action of the heat, so that the magnetism may be sufficientlyrestored to move the body in the opposite direction, and again subject the sameto the demagnetizing power of the heat.Use is made of either an electro-magnet or a permanent magnet, and the heat isdirected against a body that is magnetized by induction, rather than directlyagainst a permanent magnet, thereby avoiding the loss of magnetism that mightresult in the permanent magnet by the action of heat. Mr. Tesla also providesfor lessening the volume of the heat or for intercepting the same during thatportion of the reciprocation in which the cooling action takes place.In the diagrams are shown some of the numerous arrangements that may be made useof in carrying out this idea. In all of these figures the magnet-poles aremarked N S, the armature A, the Bunsen burner or other source of heat H, theaxis of motion M, and the spring or the equivalent thereof—namely, a weight—ismarked W.In Fig. 231 the permanent magnet N is connected with a frame, F, supporting theaxis M, from which the arm P hangs, and at the lower end of which the armature Ais supported. The stops 2 and 3 limit the extent of motion, and the spring Wtends to draw the armature A away from the magnet N. It will now be understoodthat the magnetism of N is sufficient to overcome the spring W and draw thearmature A toward the magnet N. The heat acting upon the armature A neutralizesits induced magnetism sufficiently for the spring W to draw the armature A awayfrom the magnet N and also from the heat at H. The armature now cools, and theattraction of the magnet N overcomes the spring W and draws the armature A backagain above the burner H, so that the same is again heated and the operationsare repeated. The reciprocating movements thus obtained are employed as a sourceof mechanical power in any desired manner. Usually a connecting-rod to a crankupon a fly-wheel shaft would be made use of, as indicated in Fig. 240.images [images/fig231.jpg]FIG. 231.Fig. 232 represents the same parts as before described; but an electro-magnet isillustrated in place of a permanent magnet. The operations, however, are thesame.images [images/fig232.jpg]FIG. 232.In Fig. 233 are shown the same parts as in Figs. 231 and 232, but they aredifferently arranged. The armature A, instead of swinging, is stationary andheld by arm P′, and the core N S of the electro-magnet is made to swing withinthe helix Q, the core being suspended by the arm P from the pivot M. A shield,R, is connected with the magnet-core and swings with it, so that after the heathas demagnetized the armature A to such an extent that the spring W draws thecore N S away from the armature A, the shield R comes between the flame H andarmature A, thereby intercepting the action of the heat and allowing thearmature to cool, so that the magnetism, again preponderating, causes themovement of the core N S toward the armature A and the removal of the shield Rfrom above the flame, so that the heat again acts to lessen or neutralize themagnetism. A rotary or other movement may be obtained from this reciprocation.images [images/fig233.jpg]FIG. 233.Fig. 234 corresponds in every respect with Fig. 233, except that a permanenthorseshoe-magnet, N S is represented as taking the place of the electro-magnetin Fig. 233.images [images/fig234.jpg]FIG. 234.In Fig. 235 is shown a helix, Q, with an armature adapted to swing toward orfrom the helix. In this case there may be a soft-iron core in the helix, or thearmature may assume the form of a solenoid core, there being no permanent corewithin the helix.images [images/fig235.jpg]FIG. 235.Fig. 236 is an end view, and Fig. 237 a plan view, illustrating the method asapplied to a swinging armature, A, and a stationary permanent magnet, N S. Inthis instance Mr. Tesla applies the heat to an auxiliary armature or keeper, T,which is adjacent to and preferably in direct contact with the magnet. Thisarmature T, in the form of a plate of sheet-iron, extends across from one poleto the other and is of sufficient section to practically form a keeper for themagnet, so that when the armature T is cool nearly all the lines of force passover the same and very little free magnetism is exhibited. Then the armature A,which swings freely on the pivots M in front of the poles N S, is very littleattracted and the spring W pulls the same way from the poles into the positionindicated in the diagram. The heat is directed upon the iron plate T at somedistance from the magnet, so as to allow the magnet to keep comparatively cool.This heat is applied beneath the plate by means of the burners H, and there is aconnection from the armature A or its pivot to the gas-cock 6, or other devicefor regulating the heat. The heat acting upon the middle portion of the plate T,the magnetic conductivity of the heated portion is diminished or destroyed, anda great number of the lines of force are deflected over the armature A, which isnow powerfully attracted and drawn into line, or nearly so, with the poles N S.In so doing the cock 6 is nearly closed and the plate T cools, the lines offorce are again deflected over the same, the attraction exerted upon thearmature A is diminished, and the spring W pulls the same away from the magnetinto the position shown by full lines, and the operations are repeated. Thearrangement shown in Fig. 236 has the advantages that the magnet and armatureare kept cool and the strength of the permanent magnet is better preserved, asthe magnetic circuit is constantly closed.images [images/fig236.jpg]FIG. 236.images [images/fig237.jpg]FIG. 237.In the plan view, Fig. 238, is shown a permanent magnet and keeper plate, T,similar to those in Figs. 236 and 237, with the burners H for the gas beneaththe same; but the armature is pivoted at one end to one pole of the magnet andthe other end swings toward and from the other pole of the magnet. The spring Wacts against a lever arm that projects from the armature, and the supply of heathas to be partly cut off by a connection to the swinging armature, so as tolessen the heat acting upon the keeper plate when the armature A has beenattracted.images [images/fig238.jpg]FIG. 238.Fig. 239 is similar to Fig. 238, except that the keeper T is not made use of andthe armature itself swings into and out of the range of the intense action ofthe heat from the burner H. Fig. 240 is a diagram similar to Fig. 231, exceptthat in place of using a spring and stops, the armature is shown as connected bya link, to the crank of a fly-wheel, so that the fly-wheel will be revolved asrapidly as the armature can be heated and cooled to the necessary extent. Aspring may be used in addition, as in Fig. 231. In Fig. 241 the armatures A Aare connected by a link, so that one will be heating while the other is cooling,and the attraction exerted to move the cooled armature is availed of to drawaway the heated armature instead of using a spring.images [images/fig239.jpg]FIG. 239.images [images/fig240.jpg]FIG. 240.images [images/fig241.jpg]FIG. 241.Mr. Tesla has also devoted his attention to the development of a pyromagneticgenerator of electricity* based upon the following laws: First, that electricityor electrical energy is developed in any conducting body by subjecting such bodyto a varying magnetic influence; and second, that the magnetic properties ofiron or other magnetic substance may be partially or entirely destroyed orcaused to disappear by raising it to a certain temperature, but restored andcaused to reappear by again lowering its temperature to a certain degree. Theselaws may be applied in the production of electrical currents in many ways, theprinciple of which is in all cases the same, viz., to subject a conductor to avarying magnetic influence, producing such variations by the application ofheat, or, more strictly speaking, by the application or action of a varyingtemperature upon the source of the magnetism. This principle of operation may beillustrated by a simple experiment: Place end to end, and preferably in actualcontact, a permanently magnetized steel bar and a strip or bar of soft iron.Around the end of the iron bar or plate wind a coil of insulated wire. Thenapply to the iron between the coil and the steel bar a flame or other source ofheat which will be capable of raising that portion of the iron to an orange red,or a temperature of about 600° centigrade. When this condition is reached, theiron somewhat suddenly loses its magnetic properties, if it be very thin, andthe same effect is produced as though the iron had been moved away from themagnet or the heated section had been removed. This change of position, however,is accompanied by a shifting of the magnetic lines, or, in other words, by avariation in the magnetic influence to which the coil is exposed, and a currentin the coil is the result. Then remove the flame or in any other way reduce thetemperature of the iron. The lowering of its temperature is accompanied by areturn of its magnetic properties, and another change of magnetic conditionsoccurs, accompanied by a current in an opposite direction in the coil. The sameoperation may be repeated indefinitely, the effect upon the coil being similarto that which would follow from moving the magnetized bar to and from the end ofthe iron bar or plate.The device illustrated below is a means of obtaining this result, the featuresof novelty in the invention being, first, the employment of an artificialcooling device, and, second, inclosing the source of heat and that portion ofthe magnetic circuit exposed to the heat and artificially cooling the heatedpart.These improvements are applicable generally to the generators constructed on theplan above described—that is to say, we may use an artificial cooling device inconjunction with a variable or varied or uniform source of heat.Fig. 242 is a central vertical longitudinal section of the complete apparatusand Fig. 243 is a cross-section of the magnetic armature-core of the generator.images [images/fig242.jpg]FIG. 242.images [images/fig243.jpg]FIG. 243.Let A represent a magnetized core or permanent magnet the poles of which arebridged by an armature-core composed of a casing or shell B inclosing a numberof hollow iron tubes C. Around this core are wound the conductors E E′, to formthe coils in which the currents are developed. In the circuits of these coilsare current-consuming devices, as F F′.D is a furnace or closed fire-box, through which the central portion of the coreB extends. Above the fire is a boiler K, containing water. The flue L from thefire-box may extend up through the boiler.G is a water-supply pipe, and H is the steam-exhaust pipe, which communicateswith all the tubes C in the armature B, so that steam escaping from the boilerwill pass through the tubes.In the steam-exhaust pipe H is a valve V, to which is connected the lever I, bythe movement of which the valve is opened or closed. In such a case as this theheat of the fire may be utilized for other purposes after as much of it as maybe needed has been applied to heating the core B. There are special advantagesin the employment of a cooling device, in that the metal of the core B is not soquickly oxidized. Moreover, the difference between the temperature of theapplied heat and of the steam, air, or whatever gas or fluid be applied as thecooling medium, may be increased or decreased at will, whereby the rapidity ofthe magnetic changes or fluctuations may be regulated.______________________* It will, of course, be inferred from the nature of these devices that thevibration obtained in this manner is very slow owing to the inability of theiron to follow rapid changes in temperature. In an interview with Mr. Tesla onthis subject, the compiler learned of an experiment which will intereststudents. A simple horseshoe magnet is taken and a piece of sheet iron bent inthe form of an L is brought in contact with one of the poles and placed in sucha position that it is kept in the attraction of the opposite pole delicatelysuspended. A spirit lamp is placed under the sheet iron piece and when the ironis heated to a certain temperature it is easily set in vibration oscillating asrapidly as 400 to 500 times a minute. The experiment is very easily performedand is interesting principally on account of the very rapid rate of vibration.* The chief point to be noted is that Mr. Tesla attacked this problem in a waywhich was, from the standpoint of theory, and that of an engineer, far betterthan that from which some earlier trials in this direction started. Theenlargement of these ideas will be found in Mr. Tesla’s work on the pyromagneticgenerator, treated in this chapter. The chief effort of the inventor was toeconomize the heat, which was accomplished by inclosing the iron in a source ofheat well insulated, and by cooling the iron by means of steam, utilizing thesteam over again. The construction also permits of more rapid magnetic changesper unit of time, meaning larger output."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXXVII [05_Contents.xhtml#r41]ANTI-SPARKING DYNAMO BRUSH AND COMMUTATOR [05_Contents.xhtml#r41]In direct current dynamos of great electromotive force—such, for instance, asthose used for arc lighting—when one commutator bar or plate comes out ofcontact with the collecting-brush a spark is apt to appear on the commutator.This spark may be due to the break of the complete circuit, or to a shunt of lowresistance formed by the brush between two or more commutator-bars. In the firstcase the spark is more apparent, as there is at the moment when the circuit isbroken a discharge of the magnets through the field helices, producing a greatspark or flash which causes an unsteady current, rapid wear of the commutatorbars and brushes, and waste of power. The sparking may be reduced by variousdevices, such as providing a path for the current at the moment when thecommutator segment or bar leaves the brush, by short-circuiting thefield-helices, by increasing the number of the commutator-bars, or by othersimilar means; but all these devices are expensive or not fully available, andseldom attain the object desired.To prevent this sparking in a simple manner, Mr. Tesla some years ago employedwith the commutator-bars and intervening insulating material, mica, asbestospaper or other insulating and incombustible material, arranged to bear on thesurface of the commutator, near to and behind the brush.In the drawings, Fig. 244 is a section of a commutator with an asbestosinsulating device; and Fig. 245 is a similar view, representing two plates ofmica upon the back of the brush.images [images/fig244.jpg]FIG. 244.images [images/fig245.jpg]FIG. 245.In Fig. 244, C represents the commutator and intervening insulating material; BB, the brushes. d d are sheets of asbestos paper or other suitablenon-conducting material. f f are springs, the pressure of which may be adjustedby means of the screws g g.In Fig. 245 a simple arrangement is shown with two plates of mica or othermaterial. It will be seen that whenever one commutator segment passes out ofcontact with the brush, the formation of the arc will be prevented by theintervening insulating material coming in contact with the insulating materialon the brush.Asbestos paper or cloth impregnated with zinc-oxide, magnesia, zirconia, orother suitable material, may be used, as the paper and cloth are soft, and serveat the same time to wipe and polish the commutator; but mica or any othersuitable material can be employed, provided the material be an insulator or abad conductor of electricity.A few years later Mr. Tesla turned his attention again to the same subject, as,perhaps, was very natural in view of the fact that the commutator had alwaysbeen prominent in his thoughts, and that so much of his work was even aimed atdispensing with it entirely as an objectionable and unnecessary part of dynamosand motors. In these later efforts to remedy commutator troubles, Mr. Teslaconstructs a commutator and the collectors therefor in two parts mutuallyadapted to one another, and, so far as the essential features are concerned,alike in mechanical structure. Selecting as an illustration a commutator of twosegments adapted for use with an armature the coils or coil of which have buttwo free ends, connected respectively to the segments, the bearing-surface isthe face of a disc, and is formed of two metallic quadrant segments and twoinsulating segments of the same dimensions, and the face of the disc is smoothedoff, so that the metal and insulating segments are flush. The part which takesthe place of the usual brushes, or the “collector,” is a disc of the samecharacter as the commutator and has a surface similarly formed with twoinsulating and two metallic segments. These two parts are mounted with theirfaces in contact and in such manner that the rotation of the armature causes thecommutator to turn upon the collector, whereby the currents induced in the coilsare taken off by the collector segments and thence conveyed off by suitableconductors leading from the collector segments. This is the general plan of theconstruction adopted. Aside from certain adjuncts, the nature and functions ofwhich are set forth later, this means of commutation will be seen to possessmany important advantages. In the first place the short-circuiting and thebreaking of the armature coil connected to the commutator-segments occur at thesame instant, and from the nature of the construction this will be done with thegreatest precision; secondly, the duration of both the break and of the shortcircuit will be reduced to a minimum. The first results in a reduction whichamounts practically to a suppression of the spark, since the break and the shortcircuit produce opposite effects in the armature-coil. The second has the effectof diminishing the destructive effect of a spark, since this would be in ameasure proportional to the duration of the spark; while lessening the durationof the short circuit obviously increases the efficiency of the machine.The mechanical advantages will be better understood by referring to theaccompanying diagrams, in which Fig. 246 is a central longitudinal section ofthe end of a shaft with the improved commutator carried thereon. Fig. 247 is aview of the inner or bearing face of the collector. Fig. 248 is an end view fromthe armature side of a modified form of commutator. Figs. 249 and 250 are viewsof details of Fig. 248. Fig. 251 is a longitudinal central section of anothermodification, and Fig. 252 is a sectional view of the same. A is the end of thearmature-shaft of a dynamo-electric machine or motor. A′ is a sleeve ofinsulating material around the shaft, secured in place by a screw, a′.images [images/fig246.jpg]FIG. 246.images [images/fig247.jpg]FIG. 247.images [images/fig248.jpg]FIG. 248.images [images/fig249.jpg]FIG. 249.images [images/fig250.jpg]FIG. 250.images [images/fig251.jpg]FIG. 251.images [images/fig252.jpg]FIG. 252.The commutator proper is in the form of a disc which is made up of four segmentsD D′ G G′, similar to those shown in Fig. 248. Two of these segments, as D D′,are of metal and are in electrical connection with the ends of the coils on thearmature. The other two segments are of insulating material. The segments areheld in place by a band, B, of insulating material. The disc is held in place byfriction or by screws, g′ g′, Fig. 248, which secure the disc firmly to thesleeve A′.The collector is made in the same form as the commutator. It is composed of thetwo metallic segments E E′ and the two insulating segments F F′, bound togetherby a band, C. The metallic segments E E′ are of the same or practically the samewidth or extent as the insulating segments or spaces of the commutator. Thecollector is secured to a sleeve, B′, by screws g g, and the sleeve is arrangedto turn freely on the shaft A. The end of the sleeve B′ is closed by a plate, f,upon which presses a pivot-pointed screw, h, adjustable in a spring, H, whichacts to maintain the collector in close contact with the commutator and tocompensate for the play of the shaft. The collector is so fixed that it cannotturn with the shaft. For example, the diagram shows a slotted plate, K, which isdesigned to be attached to a stationary support, and an arm extending from thecollector and carrying a clamping screw, L, by which the collector may beadjusted and set to the desired position.Mr. Tesla prefers the form shown in Figs. 246 and 247 to fit the insulatingsegments of both commutator and collector loosely and to provide some means—as,for example, light springs, e e, secured to the bands A′ B′, respectively, andbearing against the segments—to exert a light pressure upon them and keep themin close contact and to compensate for wear. The metal segments of thecommutator may be moved forward by loosening the screw a′.The line wires are fed from the metal segments of the collector, being securedthereto in any convenient manner, the plan of connections being shown as appliedto a modified form of the commutator in Fig. 251. The commutator and thecollector in thus presenting two flat and smooth bearing surfaces prevent mosteffectually by mechanical action the occurrence of sparks.The insulating segments are made of some hard material capable of being polishedand formed with sharp edges. Such materials as glass, marble, or soapstone maybe advantageously used. The metal segments are preferably of copper or brass;but they may have a facing or edge of durable material—such as platinum or thelike—where the sparks are liable to occur.In Fig. 248 a somewhat modified form of the invention is shown, a form designedto facilitate the construction and replacing of the parts. In this modificationthe commutator and collector are made in substantially the same manner aspreviously described, except that the bands B C are omitted. The four segmentsof each part, however, are secured to their respective sleeves by screws g′ g′,and one edge of each segment is cut away, so that small plates a b may beslipped into the spaces thus formed. Of these plates a a are of metal, and arein contact with the metal segments D D′, respectively. The other two, b b, areof glass or marble, and they are all better square, as shown in Figs. 249 and250, so that they may be turned to present new edges should any edge become wornby use. Light springs d bear upon these plates and press those in the commutatortoward those in the collector, and insulating strips c c are secured to theperiphery of the discs to prevent the blocks from being thrown out bycentrifugal action. These plates are, of course, useful at those edges of thesegments only where sparks are liable to occur, and, as they are easilyreplaced, they are of great advantage. It is considered best to coat them withplatinum or silver.In Figs. 251 and 252 is shown a construction where, instead of solid segments, afluid is employed. In this case the commutator and collector are made of twoinsulating discs, S T, and in lieu of the metal segments a space is cut out ofeach part, as at R R′, corresponding in shape and size to a metal segment. Thetwo parts are fitted smoothly and the collector T held by the screw h and springH against the commutator S. As in the other cases, the commutator revolves whilethe collector remains stationary. The ends of the coils are connected tobinding-posts s s, which are in electrical connection with metal plates t twithin the recesses in the two parts S T. These chambers or recesses are filledwith mercury, and in the collector part are tubes W W, with screws w w, carryingsprings X and pistons X′, which compensate for the expansion and contraction ofthe mercury under varying temperatures, but which are sufficiently strong not toyield to the pressure of the fluid due to centrifugal action, and which serve asbinding-posts.In all the above cases the commutators are adapted for a single coil, and thedevice is particularly suited to such purposes. The number of segments may beincreased, however, or more than one commutator used with a single armature.Although the bearing-surfaces are shown as planes at right angles to the shaftor axis, it is evident that in this particular the construction may be verygreatly modified."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXXVIII [05_Contents.xhtml#r42]AUXILIARY BRUSH REGULATION OFDIRECT CURRENT DYNAMOS [05_Contents.xhtml#r42]An interesting method devised by Mr. Tesla for the regulation of direct currentdynamos, is that which has come to be known as the “third brush” method. Inmachines of this type, devised by him as far back as 1885, he makes use of twomain brushes to which the ends of the field magnet coils are connected, anauxiliary brush, and a branch or shunt connection from an intermediate point ofthe field wire to the auxiliary brush.*The relative positions of the respective brushes are varied, eitherautomatically or by hand, so that the shunt becomes inoperative when theauxiliary brush has a certain position upon the commutator; but when theauxiliary brush is moved in its relation to the main brushes, or the latter aremoved in their relation to the auxiliary brush, the electric condition isdisturbed and more or less of the current through the field-helices is divertedthrough the shunt or a current is passed over the shunt to the field-helices. Byvarying the relative position upon the commutator of the respective brushesautomatically in proportion to the varying electrical conditions of theworking-circuit, the current developed can be regulated in proportion to thedemands in the working-circuit.Fig. 253 is a diagram illustrating the invention, showing one core of thefield-magnets with one helix wound in the same direction throughout. Figs. 254and 255 are diagrams showing one core of the field-magnets with a portion of thehelices wound in opposite directions. Figs. 256 and 257 are diagramsillustrating the electric devices that may be employed for automaticallyadjusting the brushes, and Fig. 258 is a diagram illustrating the positions ofthe brushes when the machine is being energized at the start.images [images/fig253.jpg]FIG. 253.images [images/fig254.jpg]FIG. 254.images [images/fig255.jpg]FIG. 255.images [images/fig256.jpg]FIG. 256.images [images/fig257.jpg]FIG. 257.images [images/fig258.jpg]FIG. 258.a and b are the positive and negative brushes of the main or working-circuit,and c the auxiliary brush. The working-circuit D extends from the brushes a andb, as usual, and contains electric lamps or other devices, D′, either in seriesor in multiple arc.M M′ represent the field-helices, the ends of which are connected to the mainbrushes a and b. The branch or shunt wire c′ extends from the auxiliary brush cto the circuit of the field-helices, and is connected to the same at anintermediate point, x.H represents the commutator, with the plates of ordinary construction. When theauxiliary brush c occupies such a position upon the commutator that theelectro-motive force between the brushes a and c is to the electro-motive forcebetween the brushes c and b as the resistance of the circuit a M c′ c A is tothe resistance of the circuit b M′ c′ c B, the potentials of the points x and Ywill be equal, and no current will flow over the auxiliary brush; but when thebrush c occupies a different position the potentials of the points x and Y willbe different, and a current will flow over the auxiliary brush to and from thecommutator, according to the relative position of the brushes. If, for instance,the commutator-space between the brushes a and c, when the latter is at theneutral point, is diminished, a current will flow from the point Y over theshunt c to the brush b, thus strengthening the current in the part M′, andpartly neutralizing the current in part M; but if the space between the brushesa and c is increased, the current will flow over the auxiliary brush in anopposite direction, and the current in M will be strengthened, and in M′, partlyneutralized.By combining with the brushes a, b, and c any usual automatic regulatingmechanism, the current developed can be regulated in proportion to the demandsin the working circuit. The parts M and M′ of the field wire may be wound in thesame direction. In this case they are arranged as shown in Fig. 253; or the partM may be wound in the opposite direction, as shown in Figs. 254 and 255.It will be apparent that the respective cores of the field-magnets are subjectedto neutralizing or intensifying effects of the current in the shunt through c′,and the magnetism of the cores will be partially neutralized, or the points ofgreatest magnetism shifted, so that it will be more or less remote from orapproaching to the armature, and hence the aggregate energizing actions of thefield magnets on the armature will be correspondingly varied.In the form indicated in Fig. 253 the regulation is effected by shifting thepoint of greatest magnetism, and in Figs. 254 and 255 the same effect isproduced by the action of the current in the shunt passing through theneutralizing helix.The relative positions of the respective brushes may be varied by moving theauxiliary brush, or the brush c may remain stationary and the core P beconnected to the main-brush holder A, so as to adjust the brushes a b in theirrelation to the brush c. If, however, an adjustment is applied to all thebrushes, as seen in Fig. 257, the solenoid should be connected to both a and c,so as to move them toward or away from each other.There are several known devices for giving motion in proportion to an electriccurrent. In Figs. 256 and 257 the moving cores are shown as convenient devicesfor obtaining the required extent of motion with very slight changes in thecurrent passing through the helices. It is understood that the adjustment of themain brushes causes variations in the strength of the current independently ofthe relative position of those brushes to the auxiliary brush. In all cases theadjustment should be such that no current flows over the auxiliary brush whenthe dynamo is running with its normal load.In Figs. 256 and 257 A A indicate the main-brush holder, carrying the mainbrushes, and C the auxiliary-brush holder, carrying the auxiliary brush. Thesebrush-holders are movable in arcs concentric with the center of thecommutator-shaft. An iron piston, P, of the solenoid S, Fig. 256, is attached tothe auxiliary-brush holder C. The adjustment is effected by means of a springand screw or tightener.In Fig. 257 instead of a solenoid, an iron tube inclosing a coil is shown. Thepiston of the coil is attached to both brush-holders A A and C. When the brushesare moved directly by electrical devices, as shown in Figs. 256 and 257, theseare so constructed that the force exerted for adjusting is practically uniformthrough the whole length of motion.It is true that auxiliary brushes have been used in connection with the helicesof the field-wire; but in these instances the helices receive the entire currentthrough the auxiliary brush or brushes, and these brushes could not be taken offwithout breaking the circuit through the field. These brushes cause, moreover,heavy sparking at the commutator. In the present case the auxiliary brush causesvery little or no sparking, and can be taken off without breaking the circuitthrough the field-helices. The arrangement has, besides, the advantage offacilitating the self-excitation of the machine in all cases where theresistance of the field-wire is very great comparatively to the resistance ofthe main circuit at the start—for instance, on arc-light machines. In this casethe auxiliary brush c is placed near to, or better still in contact with, thebrush b, as shown in Fig. 258. In this manner the part M′ is completely cut out,and as the part M has a considerably smaller resistance than the whole length ofthe field-wire the machine excites itself, whereupon the auxiliary brush isshifted automatically to its normal position.In a further method devised by Mr. Tesla, one or more auxiliary brushes areemployed, by means of which a portion or the whole of the field coils isshunted. According to the relative position upon the commutator of therespective brushes more or less current is caused to pass through the helices ofthe field, and the current developed by the machine can be varied at will byvarying the relative positions of the brushes.In Fig. 259, a and b are the positive and negative brushes of the main circuit,and c an auxiliary brush. The main circuit D extends from the brushes a and b,as usual, and contains the helices M of the field wire and the electric lamps orother working devices. The auxiliary brush c is connected to the point x of themain circuit by means of the wire c′. H is a commutator of ordinaryconstruction. It will have been seen from what was said already that when theelectromotive force between the brushes a and c is to the electromotive forcebetween the brushes c and b as the resistance of the circuit a M c′ c A is tothe resistance of the circuit b C B c c′ D, the potentials of the points x and ywill be equal, and no current will pass over the auxiliary brush c; but if thatbrush occupies a different position relatively to the main brushes the electriccondition is disturbed, and current will flow either from y to x or from x to y,according to the relative position of the brushes. In the first case the currentthrough the field-helices will be partly neutralized and the magnetism of thefield magnets will be diminished. In the second case the current will beincreased and the magnets gain strength. By combining with the brushes at a b cany automatic regulating mechanism, the current developed can be regulatedautomatically in proportion to the demands of the working circuit.images [images/fig259.jpg]FIG. 259.In Figs. 264 and 265 some of the automatic means are represented that may beused for moving the brushes. The core P, Fig. 264, of the solenoid-helix S isconnected with the brush a to move the same, and in Fig. 265 the core P is shownas within the helix S, and connected with brushes a and c, so as to move thesame toward or from each other, according to the strength of the current in thehelix, the helix being within an iron tube, S′, that becomes magnetized andincreases the action of the solenoid.In practice it is sufficient to move only the auxiliary brush, as shown in Fig.264, as the regulation is very sensitive to the slightest changes; but therelative position of the auxiliary brush to the main brushes may be varied bymoving the main brushes, or both main and auxiliary brushes may be moved, asillustrated in Fig. 265. In the latter two cases, it will be understood, themotion of the main brushes relatively to the neutral line of the machine causesvariations in the strength of the current independently of their relativeposition to the auxiliary brush. In all cases the adjustment may be such thatwhen the machine is running with the ordinary load, no current flows over theauxiliary brush.The field helices may be connected, as shown in Fig. 259, or a part of the fieldhelices may be in the outgoing and the other part in the return circuit, and twoauxiliary brushes may be employed as shown in Figs. 261 and 262. Instead ofshunting the whole of the field helices, a portion only of such helices may beshunted, as shown in Figs. 260 and 262.images [images/fig260.jpg]FIG. 260.images [images/fig261.jpg]FIG. 261.images [images/fig262.jpg]FIG. 262.The arrangement shown in Fig. 262 is advantageous, as it diminishes the sparkingupon the commutator, the main circuit being closed through the auxiliary brushesat the moment of the break of the circuit at the main brushes.The field helices may be wound in the same direction, or a part may be wound inopposite directions.The connection between the helices and the auxiliary brush or brushes may bemade by a wire of small resistance, or a resistance may be interposed (R, Fig.263) between the point x and the auxiliary brush or brushes to divide thesensitiveness when the brushes are adjusted.images [images/fig263.jpg]FIG. 263.The accompanying sketches also illustrate improvements made by Mr. Tesla in themechanical devices used to effect the shifting of the brushes, in the use of anauxiliary brush. Fig. 266 is an elevation of the regulator with the frame partlyin section; and Fig. 267 is a section at the line x x, Fig. 266. C is thecommutator; B and B′, the brush-holders, B carrying the main brushes a a′, andB′ the auxiliary or shunt brushes b b. The axis of the brush-holder B issupported by two pivot-screws, p p. The other brush-holder, B′, has a sleeve, d,and is movable around the axis of the brush-holder B. In this way bothbrush-holders can turn very freely, the friction of the parts being reduced to aminimum. Over the brush-holders is mounted the solenoid S, which rests upon aforked column, c. This column also affords a support for the pivots p p, and isfastened upon a solid bracket or projection, P, which extends from the base ofthe machine, and is cast in one piece with the same. The brush-holders B B′ areconnected by means of the links e e and the cross-piece F to the iron core I,which slides freely in the tube T of the solenoid. The iron core I has a screw,s, by means of which it can be raised and adjusted in its position relatively tothe solenoid, so that the pull exerted upon it by the solenoid is practicallyuniform through the whole length of motion which is required to effect theregulation. In order to effect the adjustment with greater precision, the core Iis provided with a small iron screw, s′. The core being first brought verynearly in the required position relatively to the solenoid by means of the screws, the small screw s′ is then adjusted until the magnetic attraction upon thecore is the same when the core is in any position. A convenient stop, t, servesto limit the upward movement of the iron core.images [images/fig264.jpg]FIG. 264.images [images/fig265.jpg]FIG. 265.images [images/fig266.jpg]FIG. 266.images [images/fig267.jpg]FIG. 267.To check somewhat the movement of the core I, a dash-pot, K, is used. The pistonL of the dash-pot is provided with a valve, V, which opens by a downwardpressure and allows an easy downward movement of the iron core I, but closes andchecks the movement of the core when it is pulled up by the action of thesolenoid.To balance the opposing forces, the weight of the moving parts, and the pullexerted by the solenoid upon the iron core, the weights W W may be used. Theadjustment is such that when the solenoid is traversed by the normal current itis just strong enough to balance the downward pull of the parts.The electrical circuit-connections are substantially the same as indicated inthe previous diagrams, the solenoid being in series with the circuit when thetranslating devices are in series, and in shunt when the devices are in multiplearc. The operation of the device is as follows: When upon a decrease of theresistance of the circuit or for some other reason, the current is increased,the solenoid S gains in strength and pulls up the iron core I, thus shifting themain brushes in the direction of rotation and the auxiliary brushes in theopposite way. This diminishes the strength of the current until the opposingforces are balanced and the solenoid is traversed by the normal current; but iffrom any cause the current in the circuit is diminished, then the weight of themoving parts overcomes the pull of the solenoid, the iron core I descends, thusshifting the brushes the opposite way and increasing the current to the normalstrength. The dash-pot connected to the iron core I may be of ordinaryconstruction; but it is better, especially in machines for arc lights, toprovide the piston of the dash-pot with a valve, as indicated in the diagrams.This valve permits a comparatively easy downward movement of the iron core, butchecks its movement when it is drawn up by the solenoid. Such an arrangement hasthe advantage that a great number of lights may be put on without diminishingthe light-power of the lamps in the circuit, as the brushes assume at once theproper position. When lights are cut out, the dash-pot acts to retard themovement; but if the current is considerably increased the solenoid getsabnormally strong and the brushes are shifted instantly. The regulator beingproperly adjusted, lights or other devices may be put on or out with scarcelyany perceptible difference. It is obvious that instead of the dash-pot any otherretarding device may be used.______________________* The compiler has learned partially from statements made on several occasionsin journals and partially by personal inquiry of Mr. Tesla, that a great deal ofwork in this interesting line is unpublished. In these inventions as will beseen, the brushes are automatically shifted, but in the broad method barelysuggested here the regulation is effected without any change in the position ofthe brushes. This auxiliary brush invention, it will be remembered, was verymuch discussed a few years ago, and it may be of interest that this work of Mr.Tesla, then unknown in this field, is now brought to light."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXXIX [05_Contents.xhtml#r43]IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OFDYNAMOS AND MOTORS [05_Contents.xhtml#r43]This invention of Mr. Tesla is an improvement in the construction of dynamo ormagneto electric machines or motors, consisting in a novel form of frame andfield magnet which renders the machine more solid and compact as a structure,which requires fewer parts, and which involves less trouble and expense in itsmanufacture. It is applicable to generators and motors generally, not only tothose which have independent circuits adapted for use in the Tesla alternatingcurrent system, but to other continuous or alternating current machines of theordinary type generally used.Fig. 268 shows the machine in side elevation. Fig. 269 is a vertical sectionalview of the field magnets and frame and an end view of the armature; and Fig.270 is a plan view of one of the parts of the frame and the armature, a portionof the latter being cut away.images [images/fig268.jpg]FIG. 268.images [images/fig269.jpg]FIG. 269.images [images/fig270.jpg]FIG. 270.The field magnets and frame are cast in two parts. These parts are identical insize and shape, and each consists of the solid plates or ends A B, from whichproject inwardly the cores C D and the side bars or bridge pieces, E F. Theprecise shape of these parts is largely a matter of choice—that is to say, eachcasting, as shown, forms an approximately rectangular frame; but it mightobviously be more or less oval, round, or square, without departure from theinvention. It is also desirable to reduce the width of the side bars, E F, atthe center and to so proportion the parts that when the frame is put togetherthe spaces between the pole pieces will be practically equal to the arcs whichthe surfaces of the poles occupy.The bearings G for the armature shaft are cast in the side bars E F. The fieldcoils are either wound on the pole pieces or on a form and then slipped on overthe ends of the pole pieces. The lower part or casting is secured to the baseafter being finished off. The armature K on its shaft is then mounted in thebearings of the lower casting and the other part of the frame placed inposition, dowel pins L or any other means being used to secure the two parts inproper position.In order to secure an easier fit, the side bars E F, and end pieces, A B, are socast that slots M are formed when the two parts are put together.This machine possesses several advantages. For example, if we magnetize thecores alternately, as indicated by the characters N S, it will be seen that themagnetic circuit between the poles of each part of a casting is completedthrough the solid iron side bars. The bearings for the shaft are located at theneutral points of the field, so that the armature core is not affected by themagnetic condition of the field.The improvement is not restricted to the use of four pole pieces, as it isevident that each pole piece could be divided or more than four formed by theshape of the casting."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XL [05_Contents.xhtml#r44]TESLA DIRECT CURRENT ARC LIGHTING SYSTEM [05_Contents.xhtml#r44]At one time, soon after his arrival in America, Mr. Tesla was greatly interestedin the subject of arc lighting, which then occupied public attention and readilyenlisted the support of capital. He therefore worked out a system which wasconfided to a company formed for its exploitation, and then proceeded to devotehis energies to the perfection of the details of his more celebrated “rotaryfield” motor system. The Tesla arc lighting apparatus appeared at a time when agreat many other lamps and machines were in the market, but it commanded noticeby its ingenuity. Its chief purpose was to lessen the manufacturing cost andsimplify the processes of operation.We will take up the dynamo first. Fig. 271 is a longitudinal section, and Fig.272 a cross section of the machine. Fig. 273 is a top view, and Fig. 274 a sideview of the magnetic frame. Fig. 275 is an end view of the commutator bars, andFig. 276 is a section of the shaft and commutator bars. Fig. 277 is a diagramillustrating the coils of the armature and the connections to the commutatorplates.images [images/fig271.jpg]FIG. 271.images [images/fig272.jpg]FIG. 272.images [images/fig273.jpg]FIG. 273.images [images/fig274.jpg]FIG. 274.images [images/fig275.jpg]FIG. 275.images [images/fig276.jpg]FIG. 276.images [images/fig277.jpg]FIG. 277.The cores c c c c of the field-magnets are tapering in both directions, asshown, for the purposes of concentrating the magnetism upon the middle of thepole-pieces.The connecting-frame F F of the field-magnets is in the form indicated in theside view, Fig. 274, the lower part being provided with the spreading curvedcast legs e e, so that the machine will rest firmly upon two base-bars, r r.To the lower pole, S, of the field-magnet M is fastened, by means of babbitt orother fusible diamagnetic material, the base B, which is provided with bearingsb for the armature-shaft H. The base B has a projection, P, which supports thebrush-holders and the regulating devices, which are of a special characterdevised by Mr. Tesla.The armature is constructed with the view to reduce to a minimum the loss ofpower due to Foucault currents and to the change of polarity, and also toshorten as much as possible the length of the inactive wire wound upon thearmature core.It is well known that when the armature is revolved between the poles of thefield-magnets, currents are generated in the iron body of the armature whichdevelop heat, and consequently cause a waste of power. Owing to the mutualaction of the lines of force, the magnetic properties of iron, and the speed ofthe different portions of the armature core, these currents are generatedprincipally on and near the surface of the armature core, diminishing instrength gradually toward the center of the core. Their quantity is under someconditions proportional to the length of the iron body in the direction in whichthese currents are generated. By subdividing the iron core electrically in thisdirection, the generation of these currents can be reduced to a great extent.For instance, if the length of the armature-core is twelve inches, and by asuitable construction it is subdivided electrically, so that there are in thegenerating direction six inches of iron and six inches of intervening air-spacesor insulating material, the waste currents will be reduced to fifty percent.As shown in the diagrams, the armature is constructed of thin iron discs D D D,of various diameters, fastened upon the armature-shaft in a suitable manner andarranged according to their sizes, so that a series of iron bodies, i i i, isformed, each of which diminishes in thickness from the center toward theperiphery. At both ends of the armature the inwardly curved discs d d, of castiron, are fastened to the armature shaft.The armature core being constructed as shown, it will be easily seen that onthose portions of the armature that are the most remote from the axis, and wherethe currents are principally developed, the length of iron in the generatingdirection is only a small fraction of the total length of the armature core, andbesides this the iron body is subdivided in the generating direction, andtherefore the Foucault currents are greatly reduced. Another cause of heating isthe shifting of the poles of the armature core. In consequence of thesubdivision of the iron in the armature and the increased surface for radiation,the risk of heating is lessened.The iron discs D D D are insulated or coated with some insulating-paint, a verycareful insulation being unnecessary, as an electrical contact between severaldiscs can only occur at places where the generated currents are comparativelyweak. An armature core constructed in the manner described may be revolvedbetween the poles of the field magnets without showing the slightest increase oftemperature.The end discs, d d, which are of sufficient thickness and, for the sake ofcheapness, of cast-iron, are curved inwardly, as indicated in the drawings. Theextent of the curve is dependent on the amount of wire to be wound upon thearmatures. In this machine the wire is wound upon the armature in twosuperimposed parts, and the curve of the end discs, d d, is so calculated thatthe first part—that is, practically half of the wire—just fills up the hollowspace to the line x x; or, if the wire is wound in any other manner, the curveis such that when the whole of the wire is wound, the outside mass of wires, w,and the inside mass of wires, w′, are equal at each side of the plane x x. Inthis case the passive or electrically-inactive wires are of the smallest lengthpracticable. The arrangement has further the advantage that the total lengths ofthe crossing wires at the two sides of the plane x x are practically equal.To equalize further the armature coils at both sides of the plate that are incontact with the brushes, the winding and connecting up is effected in thefollowing manner: The whole wire is wound upon the armature-core in twosuperimposed parts, which are thoroughly insulated from each other. Each ofthese two parts is composed of three separated groups of coils. The first groupof coils of the first part of wire being wound and connected to thecommutator-bars in the usual manner, this group is insulated and the secondgroup wound; but the coils of this second group, instead of being connected tothe next following commutator bars, are connected to the directly opposite barsof the commutator. The second group is then insulated and the third group wound,the coils of this group being connected to those bars to which they would beconnected in the usual way. The wires are then thoroughly insulated and thesecond part of wire is wound and connected in the same manner.Suppose, for instance, that there are twenty-four coils—that is, twelve in eachpart—and consequently twenty-four commutator plates. There will be in each partthree groups, each containing four coils, and the coils will be connected asfollows: Groups.Commutator Bars.First part of wireimages [images/img_p473.jpg]First1—5Second17—21Third9—13Second part of wireimages [images/img_p473.jpg]First13—17Second5—9Third21—1In constructing the armature core and winding and connecting the coils in themanner indicated, the passive or electrically inactive wire is reduced to aminimum, and the coils at each side of the plates that are in contact with thebrushes are practically equal. In this way the electrical efficiency of themachine is increased.The commutator plates t are shown as outside the bearing b of the armatureshaft. The shaft H is tubular and split at the end portion, and the wires arecarried through the same in the usual manner and connected to the respectivecommutator plates. The commutator plates are upon a cylinder, u, and insulated,and this cylinder is properly placed and then secured by expanding the split endof the shaft by a tapering screw plug, v.The arc lamps invented by Mr. Tesla for use on the circuits from the abovedescribed dynamo are those in which the separation and feed of the carbonelectrodes or their equivalents is accomplished by means of electro-magnets orsolenoids in connection with suitable clutch mechanism, and were designed forthe purpose of remedying certain faults common to arc lamps.He proposed to prevent the frequent vibrations of the movable carbon “point” andflickering of the light arising therefrom; to prevent the falling into contactof the carbons; to dispense with the dash pot, clock work, or gearing andsimilar devices; to render the lamp extremely sensitive, and to feed the carbonalmost imperceptibly, and thereby obtain a very steady and uniform light.In that class of lamps where the regulation of the arc is effected by forcesacting in opposition on a free, movable rod or lever directly connected with theelectrode, all or some of the forces being dependent on the strength of thecurrent, any change in the electrical condition of the circuit causes avibration and a corresponding flicker in the light. This difficulty is mostapparent when there are only a few lamps in circuit. To lessen this difficultylamps have been constructed in which the lever or armature, after theestablishing of the arc, is kept in a fixed position and cannot vibrate duringthe feed operation, the feed mechanism acting independently; but in these lamps,when a clamp is employed, it frequently occurs that the carbons come intocontact and the light is momentarily extinguished, and frequently parts of thecircuit are injured. In both these classes of lamps it has been customary to usedash pot, clock work, or equivalent retarding devices; but these are oftenunreliable and objectionable, and increase the cost of construction.Mr. Tesla combines two electro-magnets—one of low resistance in the main or lampcircuit, and the other of comparatively high resistance in a shunt around thearc—a movable armature lever, and a special feed mechanism, the parts beingarranged so that in the normal working position of the armature lever the sameis kept almost rigidly in one position, and is not affected even by considerablechanges in the electric circuit; but if the carbons fall into contact thearmature will be actuated by the magnets so as to move the lever and start thearc, and hold the carbons until the arc lengthens and the armature lever returnsto the normal position. After this the carbon rod holder is released by theaction of the feed mechanism, so as to feed the carbon and restore the arc toits normal length.Fig. 278 is an elevation of the mechanism made use of in this arc lamp. Fig. 279is a plan view. Fig. 280 is an elevation of the balancing lever and spring; Fig.281 is a detached plan view of the pole pieces and armatures upon the frictionclamp, and Fig. 282 is a section of the clamping tube.images [images/fig278.jpg]FIG. 278.images [images/fig279.jpg]FIG. 279.images [images/fig280.jpg]FIG. 280.images [images/fig281.jpg]FIG. 281.images [images/fig282.jpg]FIG. 282.M is a helix of coarse wire in a circuit from the lower carbon holder to thenegative binding screw –. N is a helix of fine wire in a shunt between thepositive binding screw + and the negative binding screw –. The upper carbonholder S is a parallel rod sliding through the plates S′ S2 of the frame of thelamp, and hence the electric current passes from the positive binding post +through the plate S2, carbon holder S, and upper carbon to the lower carbon, andthence by the holder and a metallic connection to the helix M.The carbon holders are of the usual character, and to insure electricconnections the springs l are made use of to grasp the upper carbon holding rodS, but to allow the rod to slide freely through the same. These springs l may beadjusted in their pressure by the screw m, and the spring l maybe sustained uponany suitable support. They are shown as connected with the upper end of the coreof the magnet N.Around the carbon-holding rod S, between the plates S′ S2, there is a tube, R,which forms a clamp. This tube is counter-bored, as seen in the section Fig.282, so that it bears upon the rod S at its upper end and near the middle, andat the lower end of this tubular clamp R there are armature segments r of softiron. A frame or arm, n, extending, preferably, from the core N2, supports thelever A by a fulcrum-pin, o. This lever A has a hole, through which the upperend of the tubular clamp R passes freely, and from the lever A is a link, q, tothe lever t, which lever is pivoted at y to a ring upon one of the columns S3.This lever t has an opening or bow surrounding the tubular clamp R, and thereare pins or pivotal connections w between the lever t and this clamp R, and aspring, r2, serves to support or suspend the weight of the parts and balancethem, or nearly so. This spring is adjustable.At one end of the lever A is a soft-iron armature block, a, over the core M′ ofthe helix M, and there is a limiting screw, c, passing through this armatureblock a, and at the other end of the lever A is a soft iron armature block, b,with the end tapering or wedge shaped, and the same comes close to and in linewith the lateral projection e on the core N2. The lower ends of the cores M′ N2are made with laterally projecting pole-pieces M3 N3, respectively, and thesepole-pieces are concave at their outer ends, and are at opposite sides of thearmature segments r at the lower end of the tubular clamp R.The operation of these devices is as follows: In the condition of inaction, theupper carbon rests upon the lower one, and when the electric current is turnedon it passes freely, by the frame and spring l, through the rods and carbons tothe coarse wire and helix M, and to the negative binding post V and the core M′thereby is energized. The pole piece M3 attracts the armature r, and by thelateral pressure causes the clamp R to grasp the rod S′, and the lever A issimultaneously moved from the position shown by dotted lines, Fig. 278, to thenormal position shown in full lines, and in so doing the link q and lever t areraised, lifting the clamp R and S, separating the carbons and forming the arc.The magnetism of the pole piece e tends to hold the lever A level, or nearly so,the core N2 being energized by the current in the shunt which contains the helixN. In this position the lever A is not moved by any ordinary variation in thecurrent, because the armature b is strongly attracted by the magnetism of e, andthese parts are close to each other, and the magnetism of e acts at right anglesto the magnetism of the core M′. If, now, the arc becomes too long, the currentthrough the helix M is lessened, and the magnetism of the core N3 is increasedby the greater current passing through the shunt, and this core N3, attractingthe segmental armature r, lessens the hold of the clamp R upon the rod S,allowing the latter to slide and lessen the length of the arc, which instantlyrestores the magnetic equilibrium and causes the clamp R to hold the rod S. Ifit happens that the carbons fall into contact, then the magnetism of N2 islessened so much that the attraction of the magnet M will be sufficient to movethe armature a and lever A so that the armature b passes above the normalposition, so as to separate the carbons instantly; but when the carbons burnaway, a greater amount of current will pass through the shunt until theattraction of the core N2 will overcome the attraction of the core M′ and bringthe armature lever A again into the normal horizontal position, and this occursbefore the feed can take place. The segmental armature pieces r are shown asnearly semicircular. They are square or of any other desired shape, the ends ofthe pole pieces M3, N3 being made to correspond in shape.In a modification of this lamp, Mr. Tesla provided means for automaticallywithdrawing a lamp from the circuit, or cutting it out when, from a failure ofthe feed, the arc reached an abnormal length; and also means for automaticallyreinserting such lamp in the circuit when the rod drops and the carbons comeinto contact.Fig. 283 is an elevation of the lamp with the case in section. Fig. 284 is asectional plan at the line x x. Fig. 285 is an elevation, partly in section, ofthe lamp at right angles to Fig. 283. Fig. 286 is a sectional plan at the line yy of Fig. 283. Fig. 287 is a section of the clamp in about full size. Fig. 288is a detached section illustrating the connection of the spring to the leverthat carries the pivots of the clamp, and Fig. 289 is a diagram showing thecircuit-connections of the lamp.images [images/fig283.jpg]FIG. 283.images [images/fig284.jpg]FIG. 284.images [images/fig285.jpg]FIG. 285.images [images/fig286.jpg]FIG. 286.images [images/fig287.jpg]FIG. 287.images [images/fig288.jpg]FIG. 288.images [images/fig289.jpg]FIG. 289.In Fig. 283, M represents the main and N the shunt magnet, both securelyfastened to the base A, which with its side columns, S S, are cast in one pieceof brass or other diamagnetic material. To the magnets are soldered or otherwisefastened the brass washers or discs a a a a. Similar washers, b b, of fibre orother insulating material, serve to insulate the wires from the brass washers.The magnets M and N are made very flat, so that their width exceeds three timestheir thickness, or even more. In this way a comparatively small number ofconvolutions is sufficient to produce the required magnetism, while a greatersurface is offered for cooling off the wires.The upper pole pieces, m n, of the magnets are curved, as indicated in thedrawings, Fig. 283. The lower pole pieces m′ n′, are brought near together,tapering toward the armature g, as shown in Figs. 284 and 286. The object ofthis taper is to concentrate the greatest amount of the developed magnetism uponthe armature, and also to allow the pull to be exerted always upon the middle ofthe armature g. This armature g is a piece of iron in the shape of a hollowcylinder, having on each side a segment cut away, the width of which is equal tothe width of the pole pieces m′ n′.The armature is soldered or otherwise fastened to the clamp r, which is formedof a brass tube, provided with gripping-jaws e e, Fig. 287. These jaws are arcsof a circle of the diameter of the rod R, and are made of hardened Germansilver. The guides f f, through which the carbon-holding rod R slides, are madeof the same material. This has the advantage of reducing greatly the wear andcorrosion of the parts coming in frictional contact with the rod, whichfrequently causes trouble. The jaws e e are fastened to the inside of the tuber, so that one is a little lower than the other. The object of this is toprovide a greater opening for the passage of the rod when the same is releasedby the clamp. The clamp r is supported on bearings w w, Figs. 283, 285 and 287,which are just in the middle between the jaws e e. The bearings w w are carriedby a lever, t, one end of which rests upon an adjustable support, q, of the sidecolumns, S, the other end being connected by means of the link e′ to thearmature-lever L. The armature-lever L is a flat piece of iron in N shape,having its ends curved so as to correspond to the form of the upper pole-piecesof the magnets M and N. It is hung upon the pivots v v, Fig. 284, which are inthe jaw x of the top plate B. This plate B, with the jaw, is cast in one pieceand screwed to the side columns, S S, that extend up from the base A. To partlybalance the overweight of the moving parts, a spring, s′, Figs. 284 and 288, isfastened to the top plate, B, and hooked to the lever t. The hook o is towardone side of the lever or bent a little sidewise, as seen in Fig. 288. By thismeans a slight tendency is given to swing the armature toward the pole-piece m′of the main magnet.The binding-posts K K′ are screwed to the base A. A manual switch, forshort-circuiting the lamp when the carbons are renewed, is also fastened to thebase. This switch is of ordinary character, and is not shown in the drawings.The rod R is electrically connected to the lamp-frame by means of a flexibleconductor or otherwise. The lamp-case receives a removable cover, s2, to inclosethe parts.The electrical connections are as indicated diagrammatically in Fig. 289. Thewire in the main magnet consists of two parts, x′ and p′. These two parts may bein two separated coils or in one single helix, as shown in the drawings. Thepart x′ being normally in circuit, is, with the fine wire upon the shunt-magnet,wound and traversed by the current in the same direction, so as to tend toproduce similar poles, N N or S S, on the corresponding pole-pieces of themagnets M and N. The part p′ is only in circuit when the lamp is cut out, andthen the current being in the opposite direction produces in the main magnet,magnetism of the opposite polarity.The operation is as follows: At the start the carbons are to be in contact, andthe current passes from the positive binding-post K to the lamp-frame,carbon-holder, upper and lower carbon, insulated return-wire in one of the siderods, and from there through the part x′ of the wire on the main magnet to thenegative binding-post. Upon the passage of the current the main magnet isenergized and attracts the clamping-armature g, swinging the clamp and grippingthe rod by means of the gripping jaws e e. At the same time the armature lever Lis pulled down and the carbons are separated. In pulling down the armature leverL the main magnet is assisted by the shunt-magnet N, the latter being magnetizedby magnetic induction from the magnet M.It will be seen that the armatures L and g are practically the keepers for themagnets M and N, and owing to this fact both magnets with either one of thearmatures L and g may be considered as one horseshoe magnet, which we might terma “compound magnet.” The whole of the soft-iron parts M, m′, g, n′, N and L forma compound magnet.The carbons being separated, the fine wire receives a portion of the current.Now, the magnetic induction from the magnet M is such as to produce oppositepoles on the corresponding ends of the magnet N; but the current traversing thehelices tends to produce similar poles on the corresponding ends of bothmagnets, and therefore as soon as the fine wire is traversed by sufficientcurrent the magnetism of the whole compound magnet is diminished.With regard to the armature g and the operation of the lamp, the pole m′ may beconsidered as the “clamping” and the pole n′ as the “releasing” pole.As the carbons burn away, the fine wire receives more current and the magnetismdiminishes in proportion. This causes the armature lever L to swing and thearmature g to descend gradually under the weight of the moving parts until theend p, Fig. 283, strikes a stop on the top plate, B. The adjustment is such thatwhen this takes place the rod R is yet gripped securely by the jaws e e. Thefurther downward movement of the armature lever being prevented, the arc becomeslonger as the carbons are consumed, and the compound magnet is weakened more andmore until the clamping armature g releases the hold of the gripping-jaws e eupon the rod R, and the rod is allowed to drop a little, thus shortening thearc. The fine wire now receiving less current, the magnetism increases, and therod is clamped again and slightly raised, if necessary. This clamping andreleasing of the rod continues until the carbons are consumed. In practice thefeed is so sensitive that for the greatest part of the time the movement of therod cannot be detected without some actual measurement. During the normaloperation of the lamp the armature lever L remains practically stationary, inthe position shown in Fig. 283.Should it happen that, owing to an imperfection in it, the rod and the carbonsdrop too far, so as to make the arc too short, or even bring the carbons incontact, a very small amount of current passes through the fine wire, and thecompound magnet becomes sufficiently strong to act as at the start in pullingthe armature lever L down and separating the carbons to a greater distance.It occurs often in practical work that the rod sticks in the guides. In thiscase the arc reaches a great length, until it finally breaks. Then the lightgoes out, and frequently the fine wire is injured. To prevent such an accidentMr. Tesla provides this lamp with an automatic cutout which operates as follows:When, upon a failure of the feed, the arc reaches a certain predeterminedlength, such an amount of current is diverted through the fine wire that thepolarity of the compound magnet is reversed. The clamping armature g is nowmoved against the shunt magnet N until it strikes the releasing pole n′. As soonas the contact is established, the current passes from the positive binding postover the clamp r, armature g, insulated shunt magnet, and the helix p′ upon themain magnet M to the negative binding post. In this case the current passes inthe opposite direction and changes the polarity of the magnet M, at the sametime maintaining by magnetic induction in the core of the shunt magnet therequired magnetism without reversal of polarity, and the armature g remainsagainst the shunt magnet pole n′. The lamp is thus cut out as long as thecarbons are separated. The cut out may be used in this form without any furtherimprovement; but Mr. Tesla arranges it so that if the rod drops and the carbonscome in contact the arc is started again. For this purpose he proportions theresistance of part p′ and the number of the convolutions of the wire upon themain magnet so that when the carbons come in contact a sufficient amount ofcurrent is diverted through the carbons and the part x′ to destroy or neutralizethe magnetism of the compound magnet. Then the armature g, having a slighttendency to approach to the clamping pole m′, comes out of contact with thereleasing pole n′. As soon as this happens, the current through the part p′ isinterrupted, and the whole current passes through the part x. The magnet M isnow strongly magnetized, the armature g is attracted, and the rod clamped. Atthe same time the armature lever L is pulled down out of its normal position andthe arc started. In this way the lamp cuts itself out automatically when the arcgets too long, and reinserts itself automatically in the circuit if the carbonsdrop together."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XLI [05_Contents.xhtml#r45]IMPROVEMENT IN “UNIPOLAR” GENERATORS [05_Contents.xhtml#r45]Another interesting class of apparatus to which Mr. Tesla has directed hisattention, is that of “unipolar” generators, in which a disc or a cylindricalconductor is mounted between magnetic poles adapted to produce an approximatelyuniform field. In the disc armature machines the currents induced in therotating conductor flow from the center to the periphery, or conversely,according to the direction of rotation or the lines of force as determined bythe signs of the magnetic poles, and these currents are taken off usually byconnections or brushes applied to the disc at points on its periphery and nearits center. In the case of the cylindrical armature machine, the currentsdeveloped in the cylinder are taken off by brushes applied to the sides of thecylinder at its ends.In order to develop economically an electromotive force available forpracticable purposes, it is necessary either to rotate the conductor at a veryhigh rate of speed or to use a disc of large diameter or a cylinder of greatlength; but in either case it becomes difficult to secure and maintain a goodelectrical connection between the collecting brushes and the conductor, owing tothe high peripheral speed.It has been proposed to couple two or more discs together in series, with theobject of obtaining a higher electro-motive force; but with the connectionsheretofore used and using other conditions of speed and dimension of discnecessary to securing good practicable results, this difficulty is still felt tobe a serious obstacle to the use of this kind of generator. These objections Mr.Tesla has sought to avoid by constructing a machine with two fields, each havinga rotary conductor mounted between its poles. The same principle is involved inthe case of both forms of machine above described, but the description now givenis confined to the disc type, which Mr. Tesla is inclined to favor for thatmachine. The discs are formed with flanges, after the manner of pulleys, and areconnected together by flexible conducting bands or belts.The machine is built in such manner that the direction of magnetism or order ofthe poles in one field of force is opposite to that in the other, so thatrotation of the discs in the same direction develops a current in one fromcenter to circumference and in the other from circumference to center. Contactsapplied therefore to the shafts upon which the discs are mounted form theterminals of a circuit the electro-motive force in which is the sum of theelectromotive forces of the two discs.It will be obvious that if the direction of magnetism in both fields be thesame, the same result as above will be obtained by driving the discs in oppositedirections and crossing the connecting belts. In this way the difficulty ofsecuring and maintaining good contact with the peripheries of the discs isavoided and a cheap and durable machine made which is useful for manypurposes—such as for an exciter for alternating current generators, for a motor,and for any other purpose for which dynamo machines are used.Fig. 290 is a side view, partly in section, of this machine. Fig. 291 is avertical section of the same at right angles to the shafts.images [images/fig290.jpg]FIG. 290.images [images/fig291.jpg]FIG. 291.In order to form a frame with two fields of force, a support, A, is cast withtwo pole pieces B B′ integral with it. To this are joined by bolts E a castingD, with two similar and corresponding pole pieces C C′. The pole pieces B B′ arewound and connected to produce a field of force of given polarity, and the polepieces C C′ are wound so as to produce a field of opposite polarity. The drivingshafts F G pass through the poles and are journaled in insulating bearings inthe casting A D, as shown.H K are the discs or generating conductors. They are composed of copper, brass,or iron and are keyed or secured to their respective shafts. They are providedwith broad peripheral flanges J. It is of course obvious that the discs may beinsulated from their shafts, if so desired. A flexible metallic belt L is passedover the flanges of the two discs, and, if desired, may be used to drive one ofthe discs. It is better, however, to use this belt merely as a conductor, andfor this purpose sheet steel, copper, or other suitable metal is used. Eachshaft is provided with a driving pulley M, by which power is imparted from adriving shaft.N N are the terminals. For the sake of clearness they are shown as provided withsprings P, that bear upon the ends of the shafts. This machine, ifself-exciting, would have copper bands around its poles; or conductors of anykind—such as wires shown in the drawings—may be used.images [images/img_p397.jpg]It is thought appropriate by the compiler to append here some notes on unipolardynamos, written by Mr. Tesla, on a recent occasion.images [images/img_p397.jpg]NOTES ON A UNIPOLAR DYNAMO*It is characteristic of fundamental discoveries, of great achievements ofintellect, that they retain an undiminished power upon the imagination of thethinker. The memorable experiment of Faraday with a disc rotating between thetwo poles of a magnet, which has borne such magnificent fruit, has long passedinto everyday experience; yet there are certain features about this embryo ofthe present dynamos and motors which even today appear to us striking, and areworthy of the most careful study.Consider, for instance, the case of a disc of iron or other metal revolvingbetween the two opposite poles of a magnet, and the polar surfaces completelycovering both sides of the disc, and assume the current to be taken off orconveyed to the same by contacts uniformly from all points of the periphery ofthe disc. Take first the case of a motor. In all ordinary motors the operationis dependent upon some shifting or change of the resultant of the magneticattraction exerted upon the armature, this process being effected either by somemechanical contrivance on the motor or by the action of currents of the propercharacter. We may explain the operation of such a motor just as we can that of awater-wheel. But in the above example of the disc surrounded completely by thepolar surfaces, there is no shifting of the magnetic action, no change whatever,as far as we know, and yet rotation ensues. Here, then, ordinary considerationsdo not apply; we cannot even give a superficial explanation, as in ordinarymotors, and the operation will be clear to us only when we shall have recognizedthe very nature of the forces concerned, and fathomed the mystery of theinvisible connecting mechanism.Considered as a dynamo machine, the disc is an equally interesting object ofstudy. In addition to its peculiarity of giving currents of one directionwithout the employment of commutating devices, such a machine differs fromordinary dynamos in that there is no reaction between armature and field. Thearmature current tends to set up a magnetization at right angles to that of thefield current, but since the current is taken off uniformly from all points ofthe periphery, and since, to be exact, the external circuit may also be arrangedperfectly symmetrical to the field magnet, no reaction can occur. This, however,is true only as long as the magnets are weakly energized, for when the magnetsare more or less saturated, both magnetizations at right angles seeminglyinterfere with each other.For the above reason alone it would appear that the output of such a machineshould, for the same weight, be much greater than that of any other machine inwhich the armature current tends to demagnetize the field. The extraordinaryoutput of the Forbes unipolar dynamo and the experience of the writer confirmthis view.Again, the facility with which such a machine may be made to excite itself isstriking, but this may be due—besides to the absence of armature reaction—to theperfect smoothness of the current and non-existence of self-induction.If the poles do not cover the disc completely on both sides, then, of course,unless the disc be properly subdivided, the machine will be very inefficient.Again, in this case there are points worthy of notice. If the disc be rotatedand the field current interrupted, the current through the armature willcontinue to flow and the field magnets will lose their strength comparativelyslowly. The reason for this will at once appear when we consider the directionof the currents set up in the disc.Referring to the diagram Fig. 292, d represents the disc with the slidingcontacts B B′ on the shaft and periphery. N and S represent the two poles of amagnet. If the pole N be above, as indicated in the diagram, the disc beingsupposed to be in the plane of the paper, and rotating in the direction of thearrow D, the current set up in the disc will flow from the center to theperiphery, as indicated by the arrow A. Since the magnetic action is more orless confined to the space between the poles N S, the other portions of the discmay be considered inactive. The current set up will therefore not wholly passthrough the external circuit F, but will close through the disc itself, andgenerally, if the disposition be in any way similar to the one illustrated, byfar the greater portion of the current generated will not appear externally, asthe circuit F is practically short-circuited by the inactive portions of thedisc. The direction of the resulting currents in the latter may be assumed to beas indicated by the dotted lines and arrows m and n; and the direction of theenergizing field current being indicated by the arrows a b c d, an inspection ofthe figure shows that one of the two branches of the eddy current, that is, A B′m B, will tend to demagnetize the field, while the other branch, that is, A B′ nB, will have the opposite effect. Therefore, the branch A B′ m B, that is, theone which is approaching the field, will repel the lines of the same, whilebranch A B′ n B, that is, the one leaving the field, will gather the lines offorce upon itself.images [images/fig292.jpg]FIG. 292.In consequence of this there will be a constant tendency to reduce the currentflow in the path A B′ m B, while on the other hand no such opposition will existin path A B′ n B, and the effect of the latter branch or path will be more orless preponderating over that of the former. The joint effect of both theassumed branch currents might be represented by that of one single current ofthe same direction as that energizing the field. In other words, the eddycurrents circulating in the disc will energize the field magnet. This is aresult quite contrary to what we might be led to suppose at first, for we wouldnaturally expect that the resulting effect of the armature currents would besuch as to oppose the field current, as generally occurs when a primary andsecondary conductor are placed in inductive relations to each other. But it mustbe remembered that this results from the peculiar disposition in this case,namely, two paths being afforded to the current, and the latter selecting thatpath which offers the least opposition to its flow. From this we see that theeddy currents flowing in the disc partly energize the field, and for this reasonwhen the field current is interrupted the currents in the disc will continue toflow, and the field magnet will lose its strength with comparative slowness andmay even retain a certain strength as long as the rotation of the disc iscontinued.The result will, of course, largely depend on the resistance and geometricaldimensions of the path of the resulting eddy current and on the speed ofrotation; these elements, namely, determine the retardation of this current andits position relative to the field. For a certain speed there would be a maximumenergizing action; then at higher speeds, it would gradually fall off to zeroand finally reverse, that is, the resultant eddy current effect would be toweaken the field. The reaction would be best demonstrated experimentally byarranging the fields N S, N′ S′, freely movable on an axis concentric with theshaft of the disc. If the latter were rotated as before in the direction of thearrow D, the field would be dragged in the same direction with a torque, which,up to a certain point, would go on increasing with the speed of rotation, thenfall off, and, passing through zero, finally become negative; that is, the fieldwould begin to rotate in opposite direction to the disc. In experiments withalternate current motors in which the field was shifted by currents of differingphase, this interesting result was observed. For very low speeds of rotation ofthe field the motor would show a torque of 900 lbs. or more, measured on apulley 12 inches in diameter. When the speed of rotation of the poles wasincreased, the torque would diminish, would finally go down to zero, becomenegative, and then the armature would begin to rotate in opposite direction tothe field.To return to the principal subject; assume the conditions to be such that theeddy currents generated by the rotation of the disc strengthen the field, andsuppose the latter gradually removed while the disc is kept rotating at anincreased rate. The current, once started, may then be sufficient to maintainitself and even increase in strength, and then we have the case of Sir WilliamThomson’s “current accumulator.” But from the above considerations it would seemthat for the success of the experiment the employment of a disc not subdivided*would be essential, for if there should be a radial subdivision, the eddycurrents could not form and the self-exciting action would cease. If such aradially subdivided disc were used it would be necessary to connect the spokesby a conducting rim or in any proper manner so as to form a symmetrical systemof closed circuits.The action of the eddy currents may be utilized to excite a machine of anyconstruction. For instance, in Figs. 293 and 294 an arrangement is shown bywhich a machine with a disc armature might be excited. Here a number of magnets,N S, N S, are placed radially on each side of a metal disc D carrying on its rima set of insulated coils, C C. The magnets form two separate fields, an internaland an external one, the solid disc rotating in the field nearest the axis, andthe coils in the field further from it. Assume the magnets slightly energized atthe start; they could be strengthened by the action of the eddy currents in thesolid disc so as to afford a stronger field for the peripheral coils. Althoughthere is no doubt that under proper conditions a machine might be excited inthis or a similar manner, there being sufficient experimental evidence towarrant such an assertion, such a mode of excitation would be wasteful.images [images/fig293.jpg]FIG. 293.images [images/fig294.jpg]FIG. 294.But a unipolar dynamo or motor, such as shown in Fig. 292, may be excited in anefficient manner by simply properly subdividing the disc or cylinder in whichthe currents are set up, and it is practicable to do away with the field coilswhich are usually employed. Such a plan is illustrated in Fig. 295. The disc orcylinder D is supposed to be arranged to rotate between the two poles N and S ofa magnet, which completely cover it on both sides, the contours of the disc andpoles being represented by the circles d and d1 respectively, the upper polebeing omitted for the sake of clearness. The cores of the magnet are supposed tobe hollow, the shaft C of the disc passing through them. If the unmarked pole bebelow, and the disc be rotated screw fashion, the current will be, as before,from the center to the periphery, and may be taken off by suitable slidingcontacts, B B′, on the shaft and periphery respectively. In this arrangement thecurrent flowing through the disc and external circuit will have no appreciableeffect on the field magnet.images [images/fig295.jpg]FIG. 295.But let us now suppose the disc to be subdivided spirally, as indicated by thefull or dotted lines, Fig. 295. The difference of potential between a point onthe shaft and a point on the periphery will remain unchanged, in sign as well asin amount. The only difference will be that the resistance of the disc will beaugmented and that there will be a greater fall of potential from a point on theshaft to a point on the periphery when the same current is traversing theexternal circuit. But since the current is forced to follow the lines ofsubdivision, we see that it will tend either to energize or de-energize thefield, and this will depend, other things being equal, upon the direction of thelines of subdivision. If the subdivision be as indicated by the full lines inFig. 295, it is evident that if the current is of the same direction as before,that is, from center to periphery, its effect will be to strengthen the fieldmagnet; whereas, if the subdivision be as indicated by the dotted lines, thecurrent generated will tend to weaken the magnet. In the former case the machinewill be capable of exciting itself when the disc is rotated in the direction ofarrow D; in the latter case the direction of rotation must be reversed. Two suchdiscs may be combined, however, as indicated, the two discs rotating in oppositefields, and in the same or opposite direction.Similar disposition may, of course, be made in a type of machine in which,instead of a disc, a cylinder is rotated. In such unipolar machines, in themanner indicated, the usual field coils and poles may be omitted and the machinemay be made to consist only of a cylinder or of two discs enveloped by a metalcasting.Instead of subdividing the disc or cylinder spirally, as indicated in Fig. 295,it is more convenient to interpose one or more turns between the disc and thecontact ring on the periphery, as illustrated in Fig. 296.images [images/fig296.jpg]FIG. 296.A Forbes dynamo may, for instance, be excited in such a manner. In theexperience of the writer it has been found that instead of taking the currentfrom two such discs by sliding contacts, as usual, a flexible conducting beltmay be employed to advantage. The discs are in such case provided with largeflanges, affording a very great contact surface. The belt should be made to bearon the flanges with spring pressure to take up the expansion. Several machineswith belt contact were constructed by the writer two years ago, and workedsatisfactorily; but for want of time the work in that direction has beentemporarily suspended. A number of features pointed out above have also beenused by the writer in connection with some types of alternating current motors.______________________* Article by Mr. Tesla, contributed to The Electrical Engineer, N.Y., Sept. 2,1891.* Mr. Tesla here refers to an interesting article which appeared in July, 1865,in the Phil. Magazine, by Sir W. Thomson, in which Sir William, speaking of his“uniform electric current accumulator,” assumes that for self-excitation it isdesirable to subdivide the disc into an infinite number of infinitely thinspokes, in order to prevent diffusion of the current. Mr. Tesla shows thatdiffusion is absolutely necessary for the excitation and that when the disc issubdivided no excitation can occur."},{"pageContent":"PART IV [05_Contents.xhtml#r46]APPENDIX: EARLY PHASE MOTORSAND THE TESLA MECHANICAL ANDELECTRICAL OSCILLATOR [05_Contents.xhtml#r46]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XLII [05_Contents.xhtml#r47]MR. TESLA’S PERSONAL EXHIBIT AT THE WORLD’S FAIR [05_Contents.xhtml#r47]While the exhibits of firms engaged in the manufacture of electrical apparatusof every description at the Chicago World’s Fair, afforded the visitor ampleopportunity for gaining an excellent knowledge of the state of the art, therewere also numbers of exhibits which brought out in strong relief the work of theindividual inventor, which lies at the foundation of much, if not all,industrial or mechanical achievement. Prominent among such personal exhibits wasthat of Mr. Tesla, whose apparatus occupied part of the space of theWestinghouse Company, in Electricity Building.This apparatus represented the results of work and thought covering a period often years. It embraced a large number of different alternating motors and Mr.Tesla’s earlier high frequency apparatus. The motor exhibit consisted of avariety of fields and armatures for two, three and multiphase circuits, and gavea fair idea of the gradual evolution of the fundamental idea of the rotatingmagnetic field. The high frequency exhibit included Mr. Tesla’s earlier machinesand disruptive discharge coils and high frequency transformers, which he used inhis investigations and some of which are referred to in his papers printed inthis volume.Fig. 297 shows a view of part of the exhibits containing the motor apparatus.Among these is shown at A a large ring intended to exhibit the phenomena of therotating magnetic field. The field produced was very powerful and exhibitedstriking effects, revolving copper balls and eggs and bodies of various shapesat considerable distances and at great speeds. This ring was wound for two-phasecircuits, and the winding was so distributed that a practically uniform fieldwas obtained. This ring was prepared for Mr. Tesla’s exhibit by Mr. C. F. Scott,electrician of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company.images [images/fig297.jpg]FIG. 297.A smaller ring, shown at B, was arranged like the one exhibited at A butdesigned especially to exhibit the rotation of an armature in a rotating field.In connection with these two rings there was an interesting exhibit shown by Mr.Tesla which consisted of a magnet with a coil, the magnet being arranged torotate in bearings. With this magnet he first demonstrated the identity betweena rotating field and a rotating magnet; the latter, when rotating, exhibited thesame phenomena as the rings when they were energized by currents of differingphase. Another prominent exhibit was a model illustrated at C which is atwo-phase motor, as well as an induction motor and transformer. It consists of alarge outer ring of laminated iron wound with two superimposed, separatedwindings which can be connected in a variety of ways. This is one of the firstmodels used by Mr. Tesla as an induction motor and rotating transformer. Thearmature was either a steel or wrought iron disc with a closed coil. When themotor was operated from a two phase generator the windings were connected in twogroups, as usual. When used as an induction motor, the current induced in one ofthe windings of the ring was passed through the other winding on the ring and sothe motor operated with only two wires. When used as a transformer the outerwinding served, for instance, as a secondary and the inner as a primary. Themodel shown at D is one of the earliest rotating field motors, consisting of athin iron ring wound with two sets of coils and an armature consisting of aseries of steel discs partly cut away and arranged on a small arbor.At E is shown one of the first rotating field or induction motors used for theregulation of an arc lamp and for other purposes. It comprises a ring of discswith two sets of coils having different self-inductions, one set being of Germansilver and the other of copper wire. The armature is wound with twoclosed-circuited coils at right angles to each other. To the armature shaft arefastened levers and other devices to effect the regulation. At F is shown amodel of a magnetic lag motor; this embodies a casting with pole projectionsprotruding from two coils between which is arranged to rotate a smooth ironbody. When an alternating current is sent through the two coils the poleprojections of the field and armature within it are similarly magnetized, andupon the cessation or reversal of the current the armature and field repel eachother and rotation is produced in this way. Another interesting exhibit, shownat G, is an early model of a two field motor energized by currents of differentphase. There are two independent fields of laminated iron joined by brass bolts;in each field is mounted an armature, both armatures being on the same shaft.The armatures were originally so arranged as to be placed in any positionrelatively to each other, and the fields also were arranged to be connected in anumber of ways.The motor has served for the exhibition of a number of features; among otherthings, it has been used as a dynamo for the production of currents of anyfrequency between wide limits. In this case the field, instead of beingenergized by direct current, was energized by currents differing in phase, whichproduced a rotation of the field; the armature was then rotated in the same orin opposite direction to the movement of the field; and so any number ofalternations of the currents induced in the armature, from a small to a highnumber, determined by the frequency of the energizing field coils and the speedof the armature, was obtained.The models H, I, J, represent a variety of rotating field, synchronous motorswhich are of special value in long distance transmission work. The principleembodied in these motors was enunciated by Mr. Tesla in his lecture before theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers, in May, 1888*. It involves theproduction of the rotating field in one of the elements of the motor by currentsdiffering in phase and energizing the other element by direct currents. Thearmatures are of the two and three phase type. K is a model of a motor shown inan enlarged view in Fig. 298. This machine, together with that shown in Fig.299, was exhibited at the same lecture, in May, 1888. They were the firstrotating field motors which were independently tested, having for that purposebeen placed in the hands of Prof. Anthony in the winter of 1887–88. From thesetests it was shown that the efficiency and output of these motors was quitesatisfactory in every respect.images [images/fig298.jpg]FIG. 298.images [images/fig299.jpg]FIG. 299.It was intended to exhibit the model shown in Fig. 299, but it was unavailablefor that purpose owing to the fact that it was some time ago handed over to thecare of Prof. Ayrton in England. This model was originally provided with twelveindependent coils; this number, as Mr. Tesla pointed out in his first lecture,being divisible by two and three, was selected in order to make variousconnections for two and three-phase operations, and during Mr. Tesla’sexperiments was used in many ways with from two to six phases. The model, Fig.298, consists of a magnetic frame of laminated iron with four polar projectionsbetween which an armature is supported on brass bolts passing through the frame.A great variety of armatures was used in connection with these two and otherfields. Some of the armatures are shown in front on the table, Fig. 297, andseveral are also shown enlarged in Figs. 300 to 310. An interesting exhibit isthat shown at L, Fig. 297. This is an armature of hardened steel which was usedin a demonstration before the Society of Arts in Boston, by Prof. Anthony.Another curious exhibit is shown enlarged in Fig. 301. This consists of thickdiscs of wrought iron placed lengthwise, with a mass of copper cast around them.The discs were arranged longitudinally to afford an easier starting by reason ofthe induced current formed in the iron discs, which differed in phase from thosein the copper. This armature would start with a single circuit and run insynchronism, and represents one of the earliest types of such an armature. Fig.305 is another striking exhibit. This is one of the earliest types of anarmature with holes beneath the periphery, in which copper conductors areimbedded. The armature has eight closed circuits and was used in many differentways. Fig. 304 is a type of synchronous armature consisting of a block of softsteel wound with a coil closed upon itself. This armature was used in connectionwith the field shown in Fig. 298 and gave excellent results.images [images/fig300.jpg]FIG. 300.images [images/fig301.jpg]FIG. 301.images [images/fig302.jpg]FIG. 302.images [images/fig303.jpg]FIG. 303.images [images/fig304.jpg]FIG. 304.images [images/fig305.jpg]FIG. 305.images [images/fig306.jpg]FIG. 306.images [images/fig307.jpg]FIG. 307.images [images/fig308.jpg]FIG. 308.images [images/fig309.jpg]FIG. 309.images [images/fig310.jpg]FIG. 310.Fig. 302 represents a synchronous armature with a large coil around a body ofiron. There is another very small coil at right angles to the first. This smallcoil was used for the purpose of increasing the starting torque and was foundvery effective in this connection. Figs. 306 and 308 show a favoriteconstruction of armature; the iron body is made up of two sets of discs cut awayand placed at right angles to each other, the interstices being wound withcoils. The one shown in Fig. 308 is provided with an additional groove on eachof the projections formed by the discs, for the purpose of increasing thestarting torque by a wire wound in these projections. Fig. 307 is a form ofarmature similarly constructed, but with four independent coils wound upon thefour projections. This armature was used to reduce the speed of the motor withreference to that of the generator. Fig. 300 is still another armature with agreat number of independent circuits closed upon themselves, so that all thedead points on the armature are done away with, and the armature has a largestarting torque. Fig. 303 is another type of armature for a four-pole motor butwith coils wound upon a smooth surface. A number of these armatures have hollowshafts, as they have been used in many ways. Figs. 309 and 310 representarmatures to which either alternating or direct current was conveyed by means ofsliding rings. Fig. 309 consists of a soft iron body with a single coil woundaround it, the ends of the coil being connected to two sliding rings to which,usually, direct current was conveyed. The armature shown in Fig. 310 has threeinsulated rings on a shaft and was used in connection with two or three phasecircuits.All these models shown represent early work, and the enlarged engravings aremade from photographs taken early in 1888. There is a great number of othermodels which were exhibited, but which are not brought out sharply in theengraving, Fig. 297. For example at M is a model of a motor comprising anarmature with a hollow shaft wound with two or three coils for two orthree-phase circuits; the armature was arranged to be stationary and thegenerating circuits were connected directly to the generator. Around thearmature is arranged to rotate on its shaft a casting forming six closedcircuits. On the outside this casting was turned smooth and the belt was placedon it for driving with any desired appliance. This also is a very early model.On the left side of the table there are seen a large variety of models, N, O, P,etc., with fields of various shapes. Each of these models involves some distinctidea and they all represent gradual development chiefly interesting as showingMr. Tesla’s efforts to adapt his system to the existing high frequencies.On the right side of the table, at S, T, are shown, on separate supports, largerand more perfected armatures of commercial motors, and in the space around thetable a variety of motors and generators supplying currents to them wasexhibited.The high frequency exhibit embraced Mr. Tesla’s first original apparatus used inhis investigations. There was exhibited a glass tube with one layer ofsilk-covered wire wound at the top and a copper ribbon on the inside. This wasthe first disruptive discharge coil constructed by him. At U is shown thedisruptive discharge coil exhibited by him in his lecture before the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers, in May, 1891.* At V and W are shown some ofthe first high frequency transformers. A number of various fields and armaturesof small models of high frequency apparatus as shown at X and Y, and others notvisible in the picture, were exhibited. In the annexed space the dynamo thenused by Mr. Tesla at Columbia College was exhibited; also another form of highfrequency dynamo used.In this space also was arranged a battery of Leyden jars and his largedisruptive discharge coil which was used for exhibiting the light phenomena inthe adjoining dark room. The coil was operated at only a small fraction of itscapacity, as the necessary condensers and transformers could not be had and asMr. Tesla’s stay was limited to one week; notwithstanding, the phenomena were ofa striking character. In the room were arranged two large plates placed at adistance of about eighteen feet from each other. Between them were placed twolong tables with all sorts of phosphorescent bulbs and tubes; many of these wereprepared with great care and marked legibly with the names which would shinewith phosphorescent glow. Among them were some with the names of Helmholtz,Faraday, Maxwell, Henry, Franklin, etc. Mr. Tesla had also not forgotten thegreatest living poet of his own country, Zmaj Jovan; two or three were preparedwith inscriptions, like “Welcome, Electricians,” and produced a beautifuleffect. Each represented some phase of this work and stood for some individualexperiment of importance. Outside the room was the small battery seen in Fig.311, for the exhibition of some of the impedance and other phenomena ofinterest. Thus, for instance, a thick copper bar bent in arched form wasprovided with clamps for the attachment of lamps, and a number of lamps werekept at incandescence on the bar; there was also a little motor shown on thetable operated by the disruptive discharge.images [images/fig311.jpg]FIG. 311.As will be remembered by those who visited the Exposition, the WestinghouseCompany made a line exhibit of the various commercial motors of the Teslasystem, while the twelve generators in Machinery Hall were of the two-phase typeconstructed for distributing light and power.

Besides the apparatus in the room, he employed an air compressor, whichwas driven by an electric motor.Mr. Tesla was introduced by Dr. Elisha Gray, and began by stating that theproblem he had set out to solve was to construct, first, a mechanism which wouldproduce oscillations of a perfectly constant period independent of the pressureof steam or air applied, within the widest limits, and also independent offrictional losses and load. Secondly, to produce electric currents of aperfectly constant period independently of the working conditions, and toproduce these currents with mechanism which should be reliable and positive inits action without resorting to spark gaps and breaks. This he successfullyaccomplished in his apparatus, and with this apparatus, now, scientific men willbe provided with the necessaries for carrying on investigations with alternatingcurrents with great precision. These two inventions Mr. Tesla called, quiteappropriately, a mechanical and an electrical oscillator, respectively.The former is substantially constructed in the following way. There is a pistonin a cylinder made to reciprocate automatically by proper dispositions of parts,similar to a reciprocating tool. Mr. Tesla pointed out that he had done a greatdeal of work in perfecting his apparatus so that it would work efficiently atsuch high frequency of reciprocation as he contemplated, but he did not dwell onthe many difficulties encountered. He exhibited, however, the pieces of a steelarbor which had been actually torn apart while vibrating against a minute aircushion.With the piston above referred to there is associated in one of his models in anindependent chamber an air spring, or dash pot, or else he obtains the springwithin the chambers of the oscillator itself. To appreciate the beauty of thisit is only necessary to say that in that disposition, as he showed it, no matterwhat the rigidity of the spring and no matter what the weight of the movingparts, in other words, no matter what the period of vibrations, the vibrationsof the spring are always isochronous with the applied pressure. Owing to this,the results obtained with these vibrations are truly wonderful. Mr. Teslaprovides for an air spring of tremendous rigidity, and he is enabled to vibratebig weights at an enormous rate, considering the inertia, owing to the recoil ofthe spring. Thus, for instance, in one of these experiments, he vibrates aweight of approximately 20 pounds at the rate of about 80 per second and with astroke of about ⅞ inch, but by shortening the stroke the weight could bevibrated many hundred times, and has been, in other experiments.To start the vibrations, a powerful blow is struck, but the adjustment can be somade that only a minute effort is required to start, and, even without anyspecial provision it will start by merely turning on the pressure suddenly. Thevibration being, of course, isochronous, any change of pressure merely producesa shortening or lengthening of the stroke. Mr. Tesla showed a number of veryclear drawings, illustrating the construction of the apparatus from which itsworking was plainly discernible. Special provisions are made so as to equalizethe pressure within the dash pot and the outer atmosphere. For this purpose theinside chambers of the dash pot are arranged to communicate with the outeratmosphere so that no matter how the temperature of the enclosed air might vary,it still retains the same mean density as the outer atmosphere, and by thismeans a spring of constant rigidity is obtained. Now, of course, the pressure ofthe atmosphere may vary, and this would vary the rigidity of the spring, andconsequently the period of vibration, and this feature constitutes one of thegreat beauties of the apparatus; for, as Mr. Tesla pointed out, this mechanicalsystem acts exactly like a string tightly stretched between two points, and withfixed nodes, so that slight changes of the tension do not in the least alter theperiod of oscillation.The applications of such an apparatus are, of course, numerous and obvious. Thefirst is, of course, to produce electric currents, and by a number of models andapparatus on the lecture platform, Mr. Tesla showed how this could be carriedout in practice by combining an electric generator with his oscillator. Hepointed out what conditions must be observed in order that the period ofvibration of the electrical system might not disturb the mechanical oscillationin such a way as to alter the periodicity, but merely to shorten the stroke. Hecombines a condenser with a self-induction, and gives to the electrical systemthe same period as that at which the machine itself oscillates, so that bothtogether then fall in step and electrical and mechanical resonance is obtained,and maintained absolutely unvaried.Next he showed a model of a motor with delicate wheelwork, which was driven bythese currents at a constant speed, no matter what the air pressure applied was,so that this motor could be employed as a clock. He also showed a clock soconstructed that it could be attached to one of the oscillators, and would keepabsolutely correct time. Another curious and interesting feature which Mr. Teslapointed out was that, instead of controlling the motion of the reciprocatingpiston by means of a spring, so as to obtain isochronous vibration, he wasactually able to control the mechanical motion by the natural vibration of theelectro-magnetic system, and he said that the case was a very simple one, andwas quite analogous to that of a pendulum. Thus, supposing we had a pendulum ofgreat weight, preferably, which would be maintained in vibration by force,periodically applied; now that force, no matter how it might vary, although itwould oscillate the pendulum, would have no control over its period.Mr. Tesla also described a very interesting phenomenon which he illustrated byan experiment. By means of this new apparatus, he is able to produce analternating current in which the E. M. F. of the impulses in one directionpreponderates over that of those in the other, so that there is produced theeffect of a direct current. In fact he expressed the hope that these currentswould be capable of application in many instances, serving as direct currents.The principle involved in this preponderating E. M. F. he explains in this way:Suppose a conductor is moved into the magnetic field and then suddenlywithdrawn. If the current is not retarded, then the work performed will be amere fractional one; but if the current is retarded, then the magnetic fieldacts as a spring. Imagine that the motion of the conductor is arrested by thecurrent generated, and that at the instant when it stops to move into the field,there is still the maximum current flowing in the conductor; then this currentwill, according to Lenz’s law, drive the conductor out of the field again, andif the conductor has no resistance, then it would leave the field with thevelocity it entered it. Now it is clear that if, instead of simply depending onthe current to drive the conductor out of the field, the mechanically appliedforce is so timed that it helps the conductor to get out of the field, then itmight leave the field with higher velocity than it entered it, and thus oneimpulse is made to preponderate in E. M. F. over the other.With a current of this nature, Mr. Tesla energized magnets strongly, andperformed many interesting experiments bearing out the fact that one of thecurrent impulses preponderates. Among them was one in which he attached to hisoscillator a ring magnet with a small air gap between the poles. This magnet wasoscillated up and down 80 times a second. A copper disc, when inserted withinthe air gap of the ring magnet, was brought into rapid rotation. Mr. Teslaremarked that this experiment also seemed to demonstrate that the lines of flowof current through a metallic mass are disturbed by the presence of a magnet ina manner quite independently of the so-called Hall effect. He showed also a veryinteresting method of making a connection with the oscillating magnet. This wasaccomplished by attaching to the magnet small insulated steel rods, andconnecting to these rods the ends of the energizing coil. As the magnet wasvibrated, stationary nodes were produced in the steel rods, and at these pointsthe terminals of a direct current source were attached. Mr. Tesla also pointedout that one of the uses of currents, such as those produced in his apparatus,would be to select any given one of a number of devices connected to the samecircuit by picking out the vibration by resonance. There is indeed little doubtthat with Mr. Tesla’s devices, harmonic and synchronous telegraphy will receivea fresh impetus, and vast possibilities are again opened up.Mr. Tesla was very much elated over his latest achievements, and said that hehoped that in the hands of practical, as well as scientific men, the devicesdescribed by him would yield important results. He laid special stress on thefacility now afforded for investigating the effect of mechanical vibration inall directions, and also showed that he had observed a number of facts inconnection with iron cores.The engraving, Fig. 312, shows, in perspective, one of the forms of apparatusused by Mr. Tesla in his earlier investigations in this field of work, and itsinterior construction is made plain by the sectional view shown in Fig. 313. Itwill be noted that the piston P is fitted into the hollow of a cylinder C whichis provided with channel ports O O, and I, extending all around the insidesurface. In this particular apparatus there are two channels O O for the outletof the working fluid and one, I, for the inlet. The piston P is provided withtwo slots S S′ at a carefully determined distance, one from the other. The tubesT T which are screwed into the holes drilled into the piston, establishcommunication between the slots S S′ and chambers on each side of the piston,each of these chambers connecting with the slot which is remote from it. Thepiston P is screwed tightly on a shaft A which passes through fitting boxes atthe end of the cylinder C. The boxes project to a carefully determined distanceinto the hollow of the cylinder C, thus determining the length of the stroke.images [images/fig312.jpg]FIG. 312.images [images/fig313.jpg]FIG. 313.Surrounding the whole is a jacket J. This jacket acts chiefly to diminish thesound produced by the oscillator and as a jacket when the oscillator is drivenby steam, in which case a somewhat different arrangement of the magnets isemployed. The apparatus here illustrated was intended for demonstrationpurposes, air being used as most convenient for this purpose.A magnetic frame M M is fastened so as to closely surround the oscillator and isprovided with energizing coils which establish two strong magnetic fields onopposite sides. The magnetic frame is made up of thin sheet iron. In theintensely concentrated field thus produced, there are arranged two pairs ofcoils H H supported in metallic frames which are screwed on the shaft A of thepiston and have additional bearings in the boxes B B on each side. The whole ismounted on a metallic base resting on two wooden blocks.The operation of the device is as follows: The working fluid being admittedthrough an inlet pipe to the slot I and the piston being supposed to be in theposition indicated, it is sufficient, though not necessary, to give a gentle tapon one of the shaft ends protruding from the boxes B. Assume that the motionimparted be such as to move the piston to the left (when looking at the diagram)then the air rushes through the slot S′ and tube T into the chamber to the left.The pressure now drives the piston towards the right and, owing to its inertia,it overshoots the position of equilibrium and allows the air to rush through theslot S and tube T into the chamber to the right, while the communication to theleft hand chamber is cut off, the air of the latter chamber escaping through theoutlet O on the left. On the return stroke a similar operation takes place onthe right hand side. This oscillation is maintained continuously and theapparatus performs vibrations from a scarcely perceptible quiver amounting to nomore than ¼ of an inch, up to vibrations of a little over ⅜ of an inch,according to the air pressure and load. It is indeed interesting to see how anincandescent lamp is kept burning with the apparatus showing a scarcelyperceptible quiver.To perfect the mechanical part of the apparatus so that oscillations aremaintained economically was one thing, and Mr. Tesla hinted in his lecture atthe great difficulties he had first encountered to accomplish this. But toproduce oscillations which would be of constant period was another task of nomean proportions. As already pointed out, Mr. Tesla obtains the constancy ofperiod in three distinct ways. Thus, he provides properly calculated chambers,as in the case illustrated, in the oscillator itself; or he associates with theoscillator an air spring of constant resilience. But the most interesting ofall, perhaps, is the maintenance of the constancy of oscillation by the reactionof the electromagnetic part of the combination. Mr. Tesla winds his coils, bypreference, for high tension and associates with them a condenser, making thenatural period of the combination fairly approximating to the average period atwhich the piston would oscillate without any particular provision being made forthe constancy of period under varying pressure and load. As the piston with thecoils is perfectly free to move, it is extremely susceptible to the influence ofthe natural vibration set up in the circuits of the coils H H. The mechanicalefficiency of the apparatus is very high owing to the fact that friction isreduced to a minimum and the weights which are moved are small; the output ofthe oscillator is therefore a very large one.Theoretically considered, when the various advantages which Mr. Tesla holds outare examined, it is surprising, considering the simplicity of the arrangement,that nothing was done in this direction before. No doubt many inventors, at onetime or other, have entertained the idea of generating currents by attaching acoil or a magnetic core to the piston of a steam engine, or generating currentsby the vibrations of a tuning fork, or similar devices, but the disadvantages ofsuch arrangements from an engineering standpoint must be obvious. Mr. Tesla,however, in the introductory remarks of his lecture, pointed out how by a seriesof conclusions he was driven to take up this new line of work by the necessityof producing currents of constant period and as a result of his endeavors tomaintain electrical oscillation in the most simple and economical manner."},{"pageContent":"INDEX [05_Contents.xhtml#r49]Alternate Current Electrostatic Apparatus394 [38_Chapter30.xhtml#page_394]Alternating Current Generators for High Frequency150 [34_Chapter26.xhtml#page_150], 223 [35_Chapter27.xhtml#page_223], 375[37_Chapter29.xhtml#page_375]Alternating Motors and Transformers7 [09_Chapter02.xhtml#page_7]American Institute of Electrical Engineers Lecture143 [34_Chapter26.xhtml#page_143]Anthony, W.
