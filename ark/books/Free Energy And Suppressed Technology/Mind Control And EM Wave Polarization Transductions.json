Abstract For some time we have been repeatedly queried about the technical mechanisms and unusual electrodynamics of advanced mind control research, both in the West and abroad. Calling full attention to the special note above, in this paper we present a high-level over-view of the novel electromagnetic nature of mind operations, mind and body coupling, and intent • the induction of physical 3-space EM energy changes into the brain and nervous system, and into every cell of the body, from the mind's time-like coherent operations. We summarize the time-polarized electrodynamics used to engineer and affect mind operations and the mind-body coupling loop. Transduction mechanisms whereby differing EM wave polarizations can be transformed one-into-the-other are presented. We give two specific examples of lethal foreign military tests in 1997 of advanced mind control weapons against two military pilots over the central U.S. Some dangers and potential benefits of the emerging mind control technology are pointed out http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control1/p01.htm (1 of 2)24.4.2005 23:13:50"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"EXPLORE Figure 1.

These are transverse polarized photons, as is any combination of the two. The third polarization is along the z-direction, which is a longitudinal polarization. In other words, the 3-spatial energy of the longitudinal photon cannot oscillate in the x- or y- direction, and so it is oscillating to- and-fro along the line of motion, z-. The fourth polarization occurs when the energy is frozen in all three spatial dimensions x-, y-, and z- and it cannot oscillate in any of those directions. In that case, the photon oscillates its energy in the t- direction, providing the t-polarized photon. We will later discuss how time is actually highly condensed energy. In Minkowski 4-space, body operations are space-like, and are so treated in conventional materialistic physics. Mind and mind-operations are time-like, not space-like, even though they are totally electromagnetic in nature. 2 As is well-known, all observation in physics is considered 3-spatial.. 3 Mass is a 3-spatial concept, and we detect changes to mass (as, e.g., in the shift of electrons in the circuits of electrical instruments). So one may model the common physical observation mechanism as a time- differentiating process which a priori discards time-change and retains 3-spatial energy change. 4 That is, Minkowski reality is modeled in the fundamental units of L 3 t. Physical observation (via the transverse photon interaction) is the process given by applying the operator ∂ / ∂ t to L 3 t, yielding an L 3 output. Hence mind and mind operations are excluded by the usual physics instruments and observation, which simply exclude the time domain in their outputs and do not \"measure\" it. For this reason, physicists have erroneously considered mind to be \"metaphysical\" and nonreal. Indeed, most physicists to one extent or the other are materialists, and consider the \"mind\" to be nothing but the operations ongoing in a \"meat computer.\" Nonetheless, in the time-domain the time is absolutely real, and it is completely electrodynamic in nature. There is no metaphysics involved, and the temporal domain — along with mind and mind operations — is simply an erroneously neglected area of physics. In present physics, the notion of mind is comfortably disposed of by imposing the use of the \"observer\" concept, with out ever specifying that the observer has a consciousness and a mind. Indeed, \"observation\" is only about what that \"observer\" perceives. Obviously, one has a dramatically crippled physics if one eliminates that nonobservable called \"time.\" Similarly, one also has a dramatically crippled physics when one eliminates the mechanisms and physics ongoing in those time-like and dynamic \"things\" such as mind, that occupy time and function in it. From this viewpoint, Western physics adheres to its 3- spatial measurement foundation only by ignoring the transduction of time-polarized EM changes into detectable longitudinal and transverse EM wave changes. In this aspect, present Western physics is severely self-crippled. Time is totally electromagnetic and energetic in nature. The flow of time is not a separate external river on which a mass floats along like a boat drifting down the current of a great flowing river. Instead, the flow of time is generated directly on every mass by its total set of photon interactions, both virtual and ob servable. We have previously presented the exact mechanism for the flow of time. [Figure 1] Figure 2. Transduction of EM wave type by successive phase conjugate pairing. E XPLORE !

It transports both energy and time, not just energy alone. When absorbed by a mass, not only does it \"energy-excitation\" charge the mass, but also it \"time-excitation\" charges it, converting the former \"mass\" to \"mass time\". Rigorously it is masstime that emits a photon, not mass . So a mass moves through time in little spurts, by the continual macroscopic addition and subtraction of little Dt components. Further, in being driven through time, mass is continually altered to masstime (a quite different critter from mass), to mass, to masstime, to mass, etc. In any masstime state, a myriad of tiny virtual photon interactions made of very tiny (DE)(Dt)'s interact with that same mass during that particular larger Dt of the masstime state (m+Dm)(Dt). Hence mass in its alternate masstime state has that state internally structured by its surrounding environment's interactions with it. The masstime state is internally structured energetically in its (DE) component, and also internally structured temporally in its (Dt) component. A standard charged fundamental particle such as an electron, e.g., is not necessarily identical with another, when the internal structuring of its masstime state is considered. Further, by two papers by Whittaker, 5 interferometry of masstime states with either energy reactions or temporal reactions can yield observable effects and changes due to these neglected \"hidden variables\" in the electron's masstime alternative states. To engineer the mind and its operations directly, one must perform electrodynamic engineering in the time domain, not in the 3- space EM energy density domain. The direct engineering of time-like mind and mind operations — in all levels and all aspects — requires the use of time-polarized photons and time-polarized EM waves . This is the rarest form of electrodynamics, almost untouched by Western physicists. One can either painfully produce such time-polarized photons and EM waves and directly irradiate a target mass with specific assemblies of them, or one can force the mass itself to iteratively transduce ordinary transverse EM waves first into longitudinally-polarized EM waves and then into time-polarized EM waves. Both will be discussed briefly. In the West, it appears that the present author's discovery of mechanisms for producing time-polarized (scalar) EM waves [see Figure 2 ] and for transducing between wave polarizations has no precedent. [See Figure 3 ]. While scalar (time-polarized) photons are known in the literature, 1 the creation and use of time-polarized EM waves does not seem to appear in the Western physics literature. 6 Wave transduction or polarization transductions are terms used by the author for the process of transforming an EM wave's particular polarization into another polarization type. Such transduction to other than transverse polarization forms is little known in the West. It appears essentially haphazardly in some experiments, usually without any recognition by the experimenters themselves. Significant transduction in experiments will also produce \"strange\" and unexplained anomalies in the instruments being used for experimental measurements. 7 So most probably Western mind control researchers have not recognized the methodology and mechanisms 8 for transducing one type of EM wave polarization directly into another. 9 They continue to seek the \"mind\" in 3-space and hence in the brain, rather than in the time domain. On the other hand, it appears Figure 3. Interference processes for transducing higher EM wave polarizations into lower polarization states. E XPLORE !

It follows that those same scientists have very probably developed mind engineering and mind control via novel time-polarized EM wave means and a dramatically extended electrodynamics of the time-like mind operations. In the present paper we briefly develop the wave transductions and the basis for mind engineering, including the specialized use of ordinary transverse wave (TW) EM spectra to force internal EM wave transductions and time-domain operations inside irradiated bodies, cells, and tissues. Through the mind-body coupling mechanism, these transductions of transverse EM waves can operate upon the mind and its deepest operations as well as upon the body, every cell, and every part of every cell. Russian Mind Control Uses Higher EM Wave Polarizations It is apparent that the KGB psychoenergetics weapons scientists know and use the full extended EM wave polarization range. As a postulation, one would expect our own weapons scientists to know and utilize the orthodox transverse wave (TW) EM for similar research and experimentation. However, in the West scientists are just beginning to realize the importance of a very general (and weaker) type of longitudinal EM wave (LW) polarization, as evidenced by the appearance of dozens of papers on \"undistorted progressive waves\" (UPWs, which are essentially imperfect LW s with TW residues remaining). The Los Alamos National Laboratory web site has a number of such papers—particularly by Rodrigues 12 and Lu—available for free downloading. UPWs have very interesting characteristics. If they were perfect longitudinal EM waves, they would have infinite energy and infinite speed. Since only imperfect UPWs can be physically made, their speed can vary from slower than the speed of light to faster than the speed of light. Their energy can also vary over a great range. Another characteristic of UPWs that are reasonably good longitudinal EM waves, is that they pass readily through a large depth of water and mass, including through the ocean and the earth with only small interactions and losses. Yet by interfering two such beams of \"high quality\" UPWs at a great distance, then in the interference zone ordinary EM energy will rise directly out of local spacetime potential, as essentially shown by Whittaker 13 nearly a century ago. Russian weapon research facilities have weaponized these effects 14 for nearly 50 years, under rigid KGB control and operation. Nonetheless, even if using only ordinary TW waves, Western mind control researchers may get some fairly good results, brute-force-like, by using gross correlates between just the input irradiating TWs and the exhibited behavioral responses of the individual. The net input-output correlations can be determined, even though not taking into account the actual wave polarization transduction mechanisms ongoing inside the irradiated dielectric (or brain, or mind, etc.). However, Western researchers appear to have no knowledge of the exact mechanisms by means of which coherent time-like mind operations of a biological organism couple to the organism's 3-spatial body to provide the mental control loop. They also appear unaware of how the coherent 3- spatial behavior responses of the body couple back to the time-like mind to provide it with a sensory feedback of the body's responses. http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control1/p04.htm (1 of 2)24.4.2005 23:15:03"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Figure 4 Figure 4.

However, unless the wave polarization transformations are known, it is difficult or impossible to apply the ordinary GR directly , since relativists usually concentrate upon spacetime curvature by altering 3-space energy density rather than by altering time- polarized \"time-energy\" density. In applied general relativity, spacetime itself is an active medium. One speaks of a change in spacetime as a \"spacetime curvature\". Any curvature of spacetime in a local region directly performs continuous work upon any mass embedded in that region. Vice versa, any mass (or other concentration of energy) in a local spacetime continuously acts upon that spacetime to \"curve\" it. So if one wishes to perform actions upon mass in a distant region, one may generate local curvatures of spacetime in that region, and these curvature \"engines\" will directly act upon the mass at all levels. [Figure 4] This is very different from energy propagation through space from one point to another. Now the \"ordinary EM energy and actions\" arise from every spatiotemporal point within the mass, at every level, and move upwards (from inside to outside). So we speak of specific forms of \"templates\" of nested spacetime curvatures formed and utilized to engineer mass \"from inside out\" as spacetime curvature engines or vacuum engines . Use of vacuum (spacetime curvature) engineering 15 is a far more powerful form of engineering than is provided by energy propagation through space. As an example, it is easy to alter the quarks in a nucleon, using spacetime curvature engines and time-charging decay. Indeed, we have developed the mechanisms for cold fusion and the electronuclear interaction (formation of new nuclides) at feeble energy. An Invention Disclosure 16 on this work has been filed with the U.S. Patent Office, and formal patent applications are in preparation. Some information on these mechanisms and principles has been released 17 . Time as Dense EM Energy and a Strong Spacetime Curvature Agent The advantage of using the time-polarized \"time-energy\" for spacetime curvature is that time is ordinary energy compressed by a factor of at least c 2 — which, in the MKS system of units, is some 9 ¥ 10 16 . Thus use of time- polarized EM photons and waves as ST curvature agents gives an amplification of 9 ¥ 10 16 over the use of transverse-polarized EM waves for that purpose. In turn, the use of the strong EM force in ordinary TW waves as an agent of ST curvature is already a nominal 10 40 times as strong as is the weak G force used as the agent of ST curvature. The bottom line is this: For spacetime curvature effects, the use of the t-polarized domain provides amplification of some 9 ¥ 10 56 greater than the weak G-force ST curvature agent usually considered in general relativity 18 . Western Science Remains Largely Materialistic Ironically, most Western scientists are materialists and consider \"mind\" as a mystical and nonscientific concept. They tend to consider mind operations and functions either to be simply \"meat computer\" operations and functions, or at best to be very weak ordinary transverse-wave EM operations and functions in the brain and nervous system. 8 This serious self- limitation exists because in the body we measure only weak TW EM operations and functions correlated to biological behavior and brain operations. We simply do not know how to measure \"mind operations\" directly. http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control1/p05.htm (1 of 2)24.4.2005 23:15:53"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"IRIS Figure 5.

Presently our scientists do not measure the longitudinally-polarized EM wave operations and functions in the body and around it in nature. Few of them are aware that a maelstrom of such LW functions exist in the body and in all of nature in general. Presently only highly theoretical quantum field theorists seem to even be aware of the existence of scalar (t-polarized) photons, and even they are unaware of t-polarized EM waves. Certainly our scientists do not measure t-polarized EM waves in and around the body and in nature, nor do they make them in the laboratory. Apparently they have not studied such waves and their interactions with matter — living and inert — at all. But it's even worse. In ignoring the time component transported by photons and EM waves, science has also erroneously omitted half of the excitation charging and excitation decay processes whenever a mass interacts with photons and EM waves. More on that later. Brute Forcing Time Functions versus Fine Control Methods Ironically, Western mind control researchers using transverse EM waves for mind control research, are using a brute force method of evoking and using vacuum engines ( spacetime curvature engines) and a special form of general relativity, although they do not appear to realize it. While KGB scientists also use TW EM \"brute force\" TW waves when necessary, they do \"imprint\" or \"activate\" those waves with the desired internal LW and time- polarized EM wave and photon structures required to directly perform the mind engineering desired. They also do not hesitate to use LWs and t-polarized waves overtly. So in blunt terms, Western compared to Russian mind control research is probably like comparing an automobile body shop with a fine surgical ward. Having long ago worked out all those \"exact correlates\" to the internal \"information content of the field\" is where the KGB scientists are at least 20 years ahead of the West. The reason one can get mind and behavior results with the TW electromagnetics, while bypassing the real mechanism which uses t-polarized waves and photons, is due to (1) the very peculiar nature of the EM emission from a dielectric, and (2) what can be done by re-radiating that dielectric with its emitted spectrum, deliberately and very carefully altered in selected parts. We will return to that important feature later. Polarization and Observability As we stated, there are four photon polarizations and therefore there must be correspondingly four EM wave polarizations 1 The first three polarizations are the x-, y-, and z- spatial polarizations. The x- and y- polarizations are transverse polarizations and the z-polarization is a longitudinal polarization along the direction of propagation (along the z-axis, by standard notation). Simply put, we may visualize the transverse polarizations as rather like the wiggling of a fish's tail from side to side as the fish moves forward, or a whale's flukes up and down as the whale moves forward, or some combination thereof. We may visualize the longitudinal polarization as a sort of \"repetitive accordion effect\" along the line of motion of the wave. Usually the z- polarization is neglected in EM wave theory, although in recent years physicists have \"rediscovered\" longitudinal EM waves and are now intensely researching the use and characteristics of such waves. 12 http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control1/p06.htm (1 of 2)24.4.2005 23:17:25"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Figure 6 Figure 6.

Oscillation of the local rate of time produces powerful oscillations of local space-time curvatures, due to the extreme energy density of time. Individually, the t-polarized photon tends to be unobservable. However, a coherent sequential group of such t- polarized photons, each individually in the virtual state with respect to the external observer, may simply integrate in its interaction with mass over a short time period into observable change because of the coherent integration of virtual spacetime curvatures into a larger, observable spacetime curvature. Rotations and Projections in 4-Space Relativistically, any velocity change in 4- space is a rotation. Any such rotation in the time- domain also creates a tiny projection component into 3-space. Any such rotation in the 3-spatial domain also creates a tiny projection component into the time domain. Hence a sufficient series of coherent time- domain (mental) changes produces a coherent series of virtual changes in 3-space (the body), thereby coherently integrating into an observable energy change in the body. A sufficient series of coherent 3-spatial energy changes produces a coherent series of virtual changes in the time domain which coherent integrate into an observable time-domain change. Solution to the Age-Old Philosophical Problem of Intent This is in fact the solution to the age-old problem of intent , or how the nonmaterial (i.e., non-3- spatial and non-observable) mind induces a 3- spatial, observable energy change upon the 3- spatial body. It is also the solution to the problem of awareness ; i.e., how the mind is aware of itself 19 and of the responses of the body. Together the two form a closed loop coupling of the mind and body. The time delay in the loop together with memory recall for comparison, creates the sense of \"persistence\" of self in time. This also creates the sense of being a \"separate, closed being\" (i.e., of separate persistence in time — in the living entity). The sense of \"separation of self from an external world\" is created by comparing those body-to- mind sensory feedbacks which are not correlated to the mind's previous feed-forward intent. Time As Energy and Why It Is Very Dense Energy In addition to the three spatial polarizations of photons and EM waves, there is a very, very useful t-polarization along the time axis. In this polarization, the 3-spatial energy is not oscillating at all. Instead, the time or time- energy is oscillating. Time can be taken to be energy compressed by at least c 2 , so it has at least the same energy density as mass. In other words, one second is 9x10 16 joules of time- energy (energy compressed into time). The t- polarized photon or EM wave is called the scalar photon or scalar EM wave, respectively. To demonstrate why time can be regarded as energy, we need only point out that the choice of fundamental units in any physics model is totally arbitrary. We usually choose these units to ease the mathematical manipulation, ease our understanding, and simplify the ability to visualize or \"grasp\" the physics. However, if one wishes, one can build all of physics from a single fundamental unit — e.g., energy. In that case, one readily sees that time is a function of energy and only energy. Hence it is perfectly proper to regard time as energy, and to seek out what form the function takes in our normal system of units (say, the MKS system). http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control1/p07.htm (1 of 2)24.4.2005 23:18:15"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Figure 7 Figure 7.

Observation as Used in Physics Is Spatial We note that all mind operations are time-like, i.e., they are comprised as scalar EM photon functions and scalar EM wave functions. Thus the mind is a very special kind of electromagnetic system, existing in the time domain, and thus \"lost\" by the stripping away of time in the ordinary observation process. Physical observation is essentially a time-differentiating mechanism applied to a 4-spatial change, or in terms of MKS fundamental units L and t, observation θ is θ = ∂ / ∂ t(L 3 t) = L 3 [5]. Thus, as is well-known in quantum mechanics, physical observation is 3- spatial, and time is not a physical observable, even in theory. Since mind is time-like, it follows that mind is not a physical observable either, since discarding the time dimension also discards the mind. In short, one may also take physical operation as the mechanism that separates mind and body. To observe is to separate. We point out, however, that merely \"separating and discarding\" the time domain (as in physical observation of a single change) does not eliminate it, nor does it eliminate the single time-like mind change that may be involved in an intentional volition. The time domain certainly remains, even though only the 3- spatial intersection of the 4-spatial Minkowski change is given by physical mechanism and the resulting \"outputs\". So a series of coherently integrated \"mental intent\" changes introduced into the human body's overall servo-mechanism provides the continuing input. From there, ordinary physics will generate the resulting actions induced in the body by that servomechanism and its amplifying mechanisms. Two Coupling Mechanisms Make a Closed Loop This is the \"mind-to-body\" coupling mechanism. [See Figure 5 ] It is the mechanism whereby the mind is coupled to the body, and whereby mental intent is able to induce a series of physical inputs into the body servomechanism. So the body's servomechanism then generates the responses of the body (including everything from chemistry to electrical changes to muscular movements, etc.). These responses are changes in 3- space. The conscious mind is a serial processor , though extremely rapid. It produces the series of coherent intent inputs for volitional behavior. The unconscious mind is a massively parallel processor . 20 It continually produces the vast series of coherent \"unconscious intent inputs\" for control of all the deeper processes in the body, beyond usual conscious awareness. However, as the body moves or changes in 3-space, each resulting quantum change in body 3-space is also a slight rotation out of 3-space and toward the time axis. Hence it induces — in the \"virtual state\" in the time domain — a precisely correlated projection. The body's responses are in general coherent, so a coherent series of virtual state changes in the time-domain (in http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control1/p08.htm (1 of 3)24.4.2005 23:18:32"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"IRIS observation. So we may say that the time- change remains in the virtual state, with respect to attempted physical observation of a single Minkowski 4-space change. Rotation, Coherent Integration, and Intent Previously we pointed out that any change in a 4-space entity may be regarded as a rotation away from the \"trajectory\" of the entity. Hence each and every t- polarized change creates a very small projection into 3-space by its rotation slightly away from the time axis. All mind changes in the time-domain actually produce virtual 3-spatial projections in 3- space (in the physical domain). We define \"intent\" as the continued production of successively coherent mental changes, producing coherent virtual changes in the 3- space body system, with coherent integration of those 3-space virtual changes into observable 3-space energy inputs into the 3-space body system. Successively coherent mind-changes will produce successively coherent 3-space virtual changes. In short, coherent mind-changes will produce coherent integration of those 3-space virtual projections into an observable 3-space change. This is the creation of an ordinary 3-spatial energy change induced upon the 3-space body. In short, this is the mechanism whereby time- like mental intent is able to produce a series of coherent observable quantum changes in the physical body (as in the brain and nervous system). The Body as a Servomechanism From the standpoint of control theory, we may consider the body system to be a complex servomechanism system comprised of many subordinate servo systems with feedback and feedforward the mind realm) are created successively. In short, again we have coherent integration, this time in the mind or time domain. This produces \"observable\" changes in the time-mind domain, which are coherent with the body's 3-spatial changes actually performed. Thus the mind receives feedback directly from the physical movements and changes of the body. This is the manner in which the body is coupled back to the mind. 21 By comparing the \"intent\" behavioral move that was \"fed forward\" into the body, with the return \"response\" move analog that was \"fed back\" from the body to the mind, the mind is able to determine errors and differences, and originate additional correctional commands. Thus the entire mind-body loop is a closed-circuit system of feedforward and feedback, together with corrections. It also has multiple levels of such, infolded in the larger volitional levels. See again Figure 4 . This solves the age-old problem of the mechanisms for the mind-body coupling, intent, volition, conscious and unconscious functioning, sense of the external world, sense of the internal world, sense of \"being in\" the external world, etc. 22 All This Is Included in Russian Psychoenergetics This is the highly summarized basis for psychoenergetics , the KGB's division of energetics that deals with the mind and body coupling and functions, and direct engineering of (1) the mind-body coupling and (2) the mind operations directly.

These \"fitted brute-force models\" certainly can be very powerful, and certainly can produce the exact results shown in the experimental verifications of the fittings. However, they do not of themselves allow sophisticated design — for example — of the necessary time-polarized wave assemblies for engineering the entire human collective unconscious simultaneously, or for engineering the entire collective unconscious of all species on Earth (i.e., Gaia's collective unconscious), or even for precisely engineering the memory and knowledge base of an individual. This fine research article will be continued in Part II with Russian Methodology, Waves and Wave Transduction, The Cellular Control spacetime that is highly active. The mind is rooted in the time-domain and projects from that domain into 3-space. The body is rooted in the 3-space domain and projects into the time-domain. To \"change\" or \"function\" in one domain is automatically to function in the other. EM and gravitational phenomena are still modeled separately by human scientists, but not by nature. 3. In quantum mechanics, time is not an observable, but merely a parameter. 4. It is convenient to consider mass as a 3- spatial form of condensed energy. 5. E. T.

A connection to the site and to Welsh's book will immediately be found Welsh's important compendium is highly recommended, giving the reader a \"birds eye view\", so to speak, of how Western scientists think and proceed regarding the subject of mind control by electromagnetic means. Unfortunately all journalists so far researching the area have not been aware that Western electrodynamics itself is seriously flawed, and that the great Russian advances in mind engineering and mind control are a result of their secret but complete revision and correction of Western electrodynamics to provide the basis for energetics. Until Western scientists revise their own decrepit old electrodynamics fouling the textbooks, they will never catch up to the Russian mind control developments springing from intense development programs that did that revision in the late 1940s and early 1950s. 9. An Invention Disclosure on these processes and enhancement embodiments has been filed with the U. S. Patent Office. Formal patent applications are also in preparation. 10. Energetics is a unified science of an extended electrodynamics possessing a hidden infolded general relativity inside the potentials, fields, and waves. It deliberately employs higher polarizations (longitudinal and tempic) of photons and EM waves to engineer action at a distance, use of specific patterns of spacetime curvature created at a distance, and direct engineering of either inert or living bodies. It also encompasses the direct engineering of time-like mind and mind functions. It is divided into three divisions, depending upon the nature of the target. Targeted against inert materials, structures, fields, and waves it is called \"energetics. \"Against living bodies, their fields, and biochemistry, it is called \"bioenergetics.\" Against the mind and mind functions, it is called \"psychoenergetics\". 11.

By use of a time-reversal zone (TRZ) in a fluid; the free H+ ions — which are free protons — can be induced to attract each other so tightly that the edge of the nuclear force region is entered. In that case the protons form a quasi-nucleus. When the TRZ decays back to a time-forward zone (TRZ), this new quasi-nucleus decays by changing quarks in one or more nucleons, thereby producing new nuclides. We point out that means \"sense of existing in time\". 20. The \"unconscious\" is totally conscious, just multiply so. The conscious mind can see only \"a single slide in the slide projector at a time, \" so to speak. When it \"looks\" at the ongoings and outputs of the unconscious, it \"sees\" millions of slides in the slide projector simultaneously. Hence it cannot distinguish \"one and one only\". So it just sees nothing, where by \"nothing\" we mean \"no single distinguishable thing.\" It therefore is unable to consciously perceive the actions of the unconscious. When the unconscious wishes to communicate with the conscious (because of unresolved conflicts, etc.), it must produce large groupings integrated into \"symbolic scenarios\". Hence the symbolism of the unconscious, and the basis for therapeutic psychology and psychiatry. A \"symbol\", after all, is just a thing which can have many different meanings, all folded into one. 21. The mind continually has activities of its own, each of which produces coherent changes in the body to a much smaller degree. The interweaving of these \"smaller self-changes\" infolded inside the 3-space major intent changes also produces slight body changes, which in turn \"project back\" into the mind. This huge group of \"infolded self-loops\" produces the sense of \"my body\" being \"volitionally directed or occupied\" simultaneously with the \"greater intent\" loops which represent \"my intentional actions with my body\". Further; the body servo continually receives a myriad of inputs from its sensory systems, both from changes inside the body and from incoming changes from the external universe. This interweaving produces the awareness of \"being in the external world\" by having (i) changes whose feedback do not match mind-intent changes, and (ii) changes whose feedback does match mind-intent changes. This of course applies to both the conscious and unconscious levels. The purpose here is to demonstrate that there exists an actual physics of the living being, the mind as well as the body, and the coupling and interfiinctioning of mind and body. http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control1/p10.htm (1 of 2)24.4.2005 23:19:03"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"~LWF0001 this is actually a very high energy reaction; however; since the time-energy is used and is very, very dense, the amount of 3-spatial energy that must be used is very small.

In short, the time-delay coherence creates the sense of \"existing in time\". Awareness usually 22.

Bearden’s Special Note below is so very important we are repeating its publication in all 3 parts of this article.

With Hunt's method, the system as an open dissipative system far from thermodynamic equilibrium in its environment is being measured as such. This more directly allows for determination of the environmental inputs on a much broader range of subsystems, both space-like and time-like. Particularly for mental and emotional correlates to environmental stimuli, such measurements and correlations are essential. More Comprehensive Phenomenology Experiments To return: Now the scientists would perform many phenomenology experiments, making one little change at a time and profusely recording the data. Each time, they would establish the physical change(s) that occur in the body and/or the mental and emotional changes that occur in the mind for each spectral reinsertion back through the \"ship's portholes\". They would simply but painstakingly (over some years) build up an extensive database of those individual correlates. In these experiments, the experimenters will eventually be able to provoke any body or mind change they wish. Strong emotion. Intense pain. Intense pleasure. Painful thoughts. Images. Memories. http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control3/p01.htm (1 of 3)24.4.2005 23:41:20"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Mind Control and EM Wave Polarization Transductions is both illegal and immoral. Two Ways to Improve the Methodology and Experimental Correlates We diverge momentarily: If they wish to improve this methodology, they will consider the body dielectric as a nonlinear isotropic medium. Then they will pretend that the spectrum of difference frequencies between each two adjacent waves is the spectrum of \"emissions\" from the body. They would also use those, as if they were actual emitted spectral signals, instead of the actual signals emitted. That procedure will give superior correlations, but it is more complicated. Part of that is known for underwater sonar, 1 and so our own scientists may or may not have realized it for use in mind and behavior correlate determination with respect to the body dielectric. Another dramatic improvement in the depth to which the correlates can be constructed, is provided by detecting each porthole output in a two-channel device, where one channel has an adjustable time- delay as utilized by Dr. Valerie Hunt. 2 The two channels—one real-time and one slightly delayed—are then mixed, as by Hunt's method, producing an instrumental measurement of the chaotic part of the functions. Again, this can be measured, recorded, and later analyzed. It adds (i) a completely different kind of thermodynamics in the system measurements, (ii) a dramatically extended set of correlates, (iii) more direct measurement of the time-polarization causative signals, and (iv) an applications technology eventually having many additional degrees of freedom and therefore capable of Perceptions. Dreams. Visions. Memory losses. Memory changes. Personality changes. Etc. The \"delta\" in the emission spectrum (the changes from zero reference spectrum) represent the precise totality of all mental, physical, organic, chemical, etc. changes and interactions. A particularly vulnerable aspect of every mammal is the pleasure center in the brain. Experiments have shown that, when this center is stimulated, it is the most addictive experience possible. Rats will forego food, endure electrical shocks, starve, and even die to obtain stimulation of this center. Obviously a device capable of generating signals that evoke direct stimulation of the pleasure center in humans would be a powerful weapon. 3 Extending the Data Base See Figure 12. After the researchers have made an \"individual porthole signal insertion\" correlate database, then they would make a \"two, three, four,\" porthole signal insertion correlate database by inducing selected multiple changes at once. Again they would analyze everything; the program would need one or more supercomputers. It would also require quite a highly qualified multidisciplinary team, extensive facilities, substantial funding, and would be many years in duration. We are describing a decades-long program. But it's a doable. With sufficient development and performance of such a program, the researchers would have produced (with sufficient testing and analysis, and sufficient retest validation and verification) a database of \"specific correlates for a given overall desired physical, mental, or physical and http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control3/p01.htm (2 of 3)24.4.2005 23:41:20"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Mind Control and EM Wave Polarization Transductions mental delta.\" A second stage in the research would be to test the correlates and porthole insertions upon a statistically significant cross section of ordinary people, and/or specialized populations (such as toughened soldiers). The program would evolve a highly complex, very effective, ever- improving science and technology of mind and behavior control and engineering mechanisms, complete with finished database and developed applications equipment. The Dielectric Body as a Ship With Portholes Again let us review what the EM transverse wave irradiation from the body dielectric represents. Think of the body dielectric as a sort of \"ship\", with lots of portholes. When it gets irradiated, certain operations happen internally to that radiation, i.e., certain \"processes\" and \"interactions\" occur, which change both the mental and physical states. The output emissions back from the body dielectric, out through the filtering \"portholes\", will directly correlate to what has happened inside the ship. It is terribly important to realize that one can use the same frequencies and spectra coming back out of those \"portholes\" to insert EM signals and waves etc. back in there, and into the deepest processes going on in the body and in the mind (at all levels, including the deep unconscious). times. So it will reach directly into and affect any and every part of the dielectric, as you wish, and in whatever manner you have correlates for. We filed an invention disclosure 4 on the above correlate and \"back-porthole\" process for use in directly inducing full and efficient conversion directly to time- density (scalar, or time-polarized) EM waves inside the body/ cells, therefore immediately and directly time-excitation charging the body cells and all their internal components. Subtracting the Normal Correlates to Obtain the Deltas A specifically diseased body, e.g., has a specifically tailored change in its \"normal\" emission spectra, because of the disease condition alteration of its resident spacetime curvature engine. By having a database for the normal emission spectra of the healthy body, one can subtract it from the actual emitted spectra, to obtain the \"delta spectrum\". If the correlates have been previously determined by the above mentioned research program, then one may simply introduce an amplified \"delta spectrum\" into the body, i.e., through the portholes. This will immediately time-excite the cells and their components throughout the body, particularly where that disease does exist. It turns out that the time-excitation charging by that method will \"pump\" those diseased cells in the time domain. The cells themselves (and all their parts) are highly nonlinear—to time-excitation http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control3/p02.htm (1 of 2)24.4.2005 23:42:48"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Mind Control and EM Wave Polarization Transductions Remember, whatever you put back in there, is going back through the \"mixmaster\" hopper.

This is a dramatic extension to nonlinear phase conjugate optics theory. 5 General relativity tells us that each specific detail of the mass and energy structure of each cell and all its parts— down to the finest details—is accompanied by a precise set of spacetime curvatures. By reintroducing the same energy as the disease delta TW waves, the affected cells add the phase conjugates, converting the inserted TW signals into longitudinal EM wave signals. The longitudinally-pumped cells again phase conjugate, converting these longitudinal EM waves to time- polarized EM waves, and \"charging\" the cells and all their parts in the time domain. Suddenly, at that point the resident spacetime curvature engine — rather than TW or LW EM waves-serves as the \"input signal\" to the cell-and-its-parts as pumped phase conjugate mirrors (PCMs), pumped in the time domain. An extension to the distortion correction theorem of nonlinear optics results. An exact, amplified antiengine for the diseased cells — i.e., a phase conjugate replica of the resident spacetime curvature engine—is formed. This amplified antiengine overpowers the resident disease engine, powerfully time- reversing the cells and their components back to a previous healthy state. The time- reversal actually occurs over a period of time after the \"time excitation charge-up\" ceases, say over the next week or two. Usually two to three quick irradiations are required, one week apart, to give a time- reversing period of three to four weeks. Even though appreciable forces are operating internally upon the cells and all their parts, there is no net translation force upon the cells or any part. E.g., as Pepper 6 states, \"On a more fundamental level, the ideal lossless PCM reverses all the quantum numbers of the incident photon (i. e., linear momentum, angular momentum, etc. ). It can be shown that the PCM therefore experiences no linear or angular momentum transfer from the incident photons; hence, the PCM is free from photon radiation pressure and torques.\" Note that, in ordinary EM theory, it is precisely translation forces that are engendered upon charged mass by EM fields. This process is quite different. In biological terms, this process dedifferentiates (in physics: time-reverses) the diseased cells and all their components — including the genes—back to an earlier healthy state. By taking a diseased body and feeding back into it an exact amplified replica of its emitted TW spectrum, one can force the body to \"time-excitation charge\" all cells and their components immediately, with high efficiency. The human body and every cell and every part of every cell does the necessary \"calculation\" for the exact antiengine for each part. Since time is extremely condensed spatial EM energy (by a factor of almost 10 17 ), a startling contraction occurs in the radiation time required to time-charge the cells and their components and charged particles. This is a method for instant initiation of time- charging, hence it is extremely rapid. What took Priore several hours of LW irradiation to accomplish in the body, 7 can now be done in seconds with this \"thwarting\" and spectrum transduction method. In fact, it is an intense stress on http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control3/p03.htm (1 of 2)24.4.2005 23:43:48"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Figure 13 the body, and—say—should only Figure 13.

We highly stress that overcharging in this time domain can be detrimental or even lethal if prolonged. At the end of the very short time- excitation charging time, the body is \"time- excitation charged in all its minutest particles\". So everything is therefore pumped in the time domain for the next several days after the irradiation is removed, since the time-charge decays very gradually over a period of time. During that decay period, every part of the cell and body acts as a pumped phase conjugate mirror material, pumped in the time domain rather than in the 3-space energy domain. When time-pumped, the mass itself reverses to a previous physical state. This can be used for both nonliving and living masses. Because there is no forcible translation manipulation of the cells and their parts, it can be utilized on living cells in vivo. In the case of diseased cells — e.g., AIDS-it appears that three precisely determined 30-second \"AIDS correlate\" irradiations a week apart, should be sufficient to completely cure AIDS, including removal of all HIV-genetics changes from every previously infected cell of the body. Also, it would accomplish considerable rejuvenation of the body (making the body younger). Rejuvenation: Restore the Telomeres and Produce Immortal Cells Saving Most of the Casualties from Mass Terrorist Attacks To defend against things like anthrax attacks on our civilian population centers, we also have recommended to the U.S. Government the crash development of small, portable treatment machines—using similar \"antiengine-forming\" and cellular reversing \"porthole technology\". [See Figure 13 on previous page]. Such portable machines could be developed cheaply and quickly, and present government facilities could be used to massively attack the correlate database production problem. The portable treatment units could be cranked out by the hundreds of thousands and flooded down through emergency response agencies such as the police forces, the National Guard, emergency hospitals, emergency response teams, etc. Each device could be used in \"assembly line\" fashion upon hundreds of sickened patients, in case of a WMD (weapons of mass destruction) attack upon one or more of our cities.

The gradual loss of the telomeres and the resulting shortening of the chromosomes represents a cellular \"disease state\" or \"disorder\" state\" accompanied by a precise delta in the spacetime curvature engine accompanying every affected (aging) cell. By determining the correlate for that precise telomere loss in the aging body's emitted radiation spectrum, an effective telomere regeneration process immediately emerges. One simply amplifies that aging \"precise telomere reduction\" correlate and reradiates the body with it, passing an amplified correlate back into every cell of the body. The cells and all their parts— including the chromosomes—add the phase conjugate replicas, converting the incoming TW EM correlates to longitudinal EM wave correlates. The cells again phase conjugate the LWs and add the phase conjugate replicas, converting the LW correlates to time- polarized EM wave pumping correlates. This latter process time-excitation-charges the aging cells and all their parts, including the genes and chromosomes. The cellular matter itself produces the amplified \"aging antiengine\" for each and every cell and telomere ending. The result is to again add telomeres, converting the cell back to a younger, more vigorous cell, and reversing the process of aging. We point out without further elaboration that these methods also introduce direct engineering signals into the body's master cellular control system, including the regenerative subsystem. Hence the body's regenerative subsystem is involved in helping produce the necessary engines and operate upon the short telomere chains to add back telomeres. More specifically, the regenerative subsystem is changed into attack, are going to die. At least 80% of them will expire, in spite of everything the present system can do for them. Note each device could rapidly treat a whole series patients, one right after the other, merely laying them between \"blankets\" containing wire antennas, irradiating with the proper correlate spectrum quickly, moving on to the next patient, irradiating quickly (seconds), etc. The entire apparatus could be made to fit in a large suitcase-sized container, and it would be highly portable and controlled by a laptop-sized computer. Unfortunately, so far the DOD doesn't even understand what the heck we're talking about! The National Institute of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are not interested at all. After all, it isn't drugs, vaccines, antibiotics, etc. — which are simply not going to do the job. However, those are what the government and scientific communities are going to finance to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. They are then going to lose almost all those mass casualties when the terrorist attacks on our population centers inevitably occur. Those are Americans. They are going to die. Most of them could be saved. We ought to save them. For any change in state (physical, chemical, emotional, mental, perceptual), the body dielectric \"portholes\" change and the output spectrum changes. The delta from zero reference now represents that exact change. Where Western Mind Control Research Has Probably Arrived Western mind control researchers probably first established a correlation database of porthole emission correlates to changes in internal states, both physical http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control3/p04.htm (2 of 3)24.4.2005 23:44:23"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Mind Control and EM Wave Polarization Transductions perfect consonance with the external introduction of the amplified antiengines.

They almost certainly recognize the peculiar participation of every part of the body dielectric in the TW emission spectrum from the body. They will almost certainly have opted for this \"porthole\" notion of some similar expression of it, and the \"thwarting\" of these \"relaxation and release\" emission processes to engender internal physical changes in the body and in the brain-meat- computer, as they see it.

Undoubtedly they found that the induced states began to correlate with the former emission delta data base. That is, they found out which delta emissions spectra, reversed and amplified and fed back thorough the portholes, produce what internal changes. Use for healing is the simplest of all. Use for killing or debilitating is more complicated. Of course weapons researchers wish to look only at the killing aspects. That is something they understand. They do not understand healing, for they do not even have the \"regenerative\" or \"healing\" mechanism in any of the scientific papers or texts. Becker 8 came closest in this country, and Priore did it in France. Both of those scientists were suppressed and paid a bitter price for their revolutionary and innovative research. But look at what has been done, by \"input-output\" correlation research. The scientists will have a database now, that tells what state emerges in the body and in the mind, for what irradiation spectra (frequency, relationships, phases, amplitudes, wave shapes, etc.) one uses. And they did not work out all the wave-to- wave transductions ongoing in the mind and body connection and in the body and in the mind, individually, between TWÛLWÛTDW. We suspect that this is the course Western mind control researchers will have taken, without even realizing the internal wave transductions occurring. And they would not be concerned with that. They would have what they want, for weapons, mind control, and behavior control. And of the internal \"mix\" of the dielectric and all its tiniest portions. So Western mind control researchers and rogue groups probably do get good results. We are not just picking on the U.S. government here! Internal divisive groups exist in all large and powerful groups, and joust for power. In highly classified groups, these groups are greatly enabled to joust more widely, unethically, and immorally because it is so deeply hidden. So very deep classification evokes the growth and intensity of rogue groups. It's the old \"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\" routine. The implication is that in the West one or more highly classified, sustained, heavily funded developments in advanced mind control programs, probably exists and probably has existed for some time. Due to loose formation of rogue groups inside such programs, they may have dual or triple purposes, may not operate under very much legitimate government control at all, and may operate specifically for the purposes of the rogue group or groups that have gained control. In a nutshell, that's what may be going on in the clandestine mind control projects in several Western governments. The involvement of at least some rogue groups, some being \"cowboys\" who operate well outside all laws and ethics, could also result in such things as assassinations, clandestine testing on individuals without their consent, etc. In short, it could account for what seems to be actually occurring. As also is \"usual\" in such a mess, one or more of the rogue groups eventually may become very powerful because their secret weapons are very powerful. They may become confident, thinking they have the \"best in the world.\" They may actually believe they are ahead of the Russians. http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control3/p05.htm (1 of 3)24.4.2005 23:45:22"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"New Page 3 they would of course ignore the healing aspects. And they would get results of course, revolutionary results. So they would undoubtedly classify the program very highly, thinking that they had the best of the best. Rogue Groups May Also Have Arisen to Divert the Purpose of the Projects And that is where real problems may arise. Every human group has within it competing subgroups, jousting for power. The more highly classified the group and its activities, and the less that is known about it outside its confines, the more strongly and secretly the subgroups can play. So they can emerge as rogue groups pursuing their own agendas, not that of their duly elected governments. In the extreme, such a deep black program can even become a \"captured\" program, which is totally in the hands of rogues and no longer reports to or is bound by the dictates of the parent government. It has long been suspected in some quarters that even the US's highly classified research community may be riddled by such rogue groups, and so may be certain highly sensitive parts of the Research and Development community. Remember that, in every large and powerful human organization, the basis for rogue groups is power and secrecy. They are always seeking to increase their power, control, influence, prestige, etc. Nothing else. Patriotism and mission are—to rogue groups—often just idle words. They have their own agendas. And being rogue groups, they may well bring in unethical, immoral tricks: assassination, bribery, entrapment, disinformation, plausible deniability, etc. A certain percentage of a highly secret rogue group will wind up using all these things and more. It's a Where the Russians Probably Have Arrived On the other hand, the Russians will have developed instruments for detecting and isolating the LWs and the scalar waves, in addition to the ordinary mundane instruments for measuring the TWs. So they will have not only the TW correlates, but also the much finer TWÛLWÛTDW (scalar EM wave) correlates. They will understand and employ the use of vacuum engines (spacetime curvature engines) which Western researchers will often invoke but not understand or even be aware that this is what is being invoked. In other words, Western researchers probably just use the old method of \"input fi set of functions fi output\". That is the standard basis for almost all Western system analysis. With it, one doesn't have to know the exact functions and processes going on in the middle. One just determines a transfer function from a given input to the output that results. Then one catalogs that transfer function. One does that for lots and lots of transfer functions for particularly desirable results, and one has the system analysis. One also has the immediate basis for a rapidly-developed applications technology. Western scientists are good system analysts. But they have little or no comprehension of what is really going on in that \"inside the ship functions\" portion, even though they have determined the transform function which acts upon the input to give the \"from the portholes\" output. The Russians, with their additional knowledge of the actual mechanisms in the transforms, will be much more advanced than the West, because their fundamental psychoenergetics science is far more advanced, so long as we continue to use http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control3/p05.htm (2 of 3)24.4.2005 23:45:22"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"New Page 3 human characteristic, the old primate dominance game.

Russian Lethal Psychoenergetics Mind Control Tests Over the U. S. In fact, the KGB tested just such highly advanced mind control weapons over the middle of the United States in 1997 on two occasions. The tests were conducted against Captain Button in his A-10 \"Warthog\" aircraft on April 2, 1997 [See Figure 14], and upon Captain Svoboda in her A- 10 \"Warthog\" on May 27, 1997. [See Figure 15]. Over Arizona, Captain Button was thrown into a hypnogogic state, and his perceptions instantly altered and controlled. In his instant \"dream-waking\" state, everything seemed perfectly normal. His sense of direction was altered a bit more than 90 degrees, so he simply corrected and turned and \"flew toward the range\", actually flying off course by more than 90 degrees and ignoring radio contacts. He flew right on out of Arizona. At one point he circled, probably thinking he was over the range, and he probably dropped his ordnance there. Then he \"flew on back toward home,\" as he thought in his waking dream state, until his fuel ran out and he crashed and died in the explosion—dream-thinking until he died that everything was normal. All the while, his sense of the passage of time was altered. To him, in his dream-thinking, dream- acting state, everything was normal and nothing untoward had happened. So the distant KGB transmitters and associated psychoenergetics team controlled him for over an hour. Indeed, that was the exact purpose of the test: demonstrate control (at a great distance) of a skilled person performing highly skilled tasks. A secondary purpose was to stimulate the U.S. government, watch its investigation and findings, and ascertain if the U.S. knew of the extent to which Russian KGB mind control weaponry had advanced. Obligingly, we proved to me KGB that we did not understand what had actually happened to Captain Button. Captain Svoboda was from the same Wing as Captain Button and was its most experienced night fighter A-10 pilot. In fact, she taught other pilots the fine points of night flying combat missions in the A-10. About two months after Captain Button's bizarre flight and death, Svoboda was engaged in night target bombing on the range. Rising from her ordnance drop on me target, Svoboda was suddenly struck and rendered hypnogogic and in a waking-dream state. Her sense of the vertical was instantly reversed. Superb pilot that she was, she immediately dream-perceived she was diving, not climbing out of the delivery. She instantly corrected to \"climb out\". So in the real world she dived sharply into the ground and her aircraft exploded. This test demonstrated the instant alteration of a skilled pilot's perception, causing that pilot to inadvertently react promptly in an unintentionally suicidal manner. A secondary purpose of the test was to stimulate the U.S. government system again, to see if the system recognized what had http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control3/p06.htm (1 of 2)24.4.2005 23:46:42"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"EXPLORE E XPLORE !

It was lamely speculated that Svoboda probably looked over her shoulder like a rank greenhorn, and inadvertently dived her aircraft into the ground while looking back at the target.

At any rate, the KGB determined that the U.S. scientific, intelligence, and governmental communities did not have the foggiest notion of what had occurred. In private proprietary communications 9 we have explained further, to proper parties, exactly the reasons for these two tests, and what exactly was being tested, and what is its planned strategic use. The Final Race for Direct Mind Control of the Entire Human Species The KGB psychoenergetics weapons scientists— because of their direct measurements and detections (and use) of t-polarized waves and LWs for decades—also understand that Jung's collective unconscious mind (of the entire human species) also has its own time-like operations and correlates, which one measures also when using t- polarization measurements and sorting it all out. The collective unconscious mind operations are buried several levels deeper inside the recursive Whittaker structuring inside the EM fields, waves, and potentials. The KGB scientists also know that something very like Gaia— a collective unconscious mind for all species on earth—also exists, and they are striving to be able to sort out and measure that one as well. The Gaia operations are buried even deeper in the recursive structuring inside the EM fields, waves, and potentials. If one reads some later books by Kaznacheyev, 10 e.g , this human species unconscious mind aspect and the biosphere unconscious mind aspect emerges loud and clear, if one interpolates between the lines, so to speak. Actually, from day one, the Russian mind control scientists have had their eventual goal set upon this \"deeper area of mind and possible mind control\" of the entire human species. I am convinced that the KGB psychoenergetics scientists understand this deeper area. If they can learn to directly engineer the collective human species unconscious, they can then convert the human species easily into a sort of \"ant\" society, modeled along ideal Communism lines, except of course with an excluded \"hierarchy at the top\" running everything. The \"ant society\"—communist style—is still a variation of feudalism (all systems tend to feudalism or some form thereof). The KGB psychoenergetics weapon scientists are seriously pressing on toward that very goal. In my opinion they are not very far from it right now. It is simply a matter of developing sufficiently complex equipment to be able to directly engineer the time-domain substructuring at sufficiently deep levels. It is a doable, although it is very, very complex and very, very difficult. On the other hand, they have been at it for decades. Even in the 50s the Russians already had the old LIDA device, ll capable of inducing a catatonic trance-like state in a mammal—either a human or a cat, 12 for example. Some versions of Russian mind control devices were used on Russian soldiers in the http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control3/p07.htm (1 of 2)24.4.2005 23:47:59"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Figure 15 Figure 15.

They will likely seek to increase their personal control and further isolate the programs from orthodox government review and from government and legislative control. They may even divert the research into highly illegal and unethical means, because it furthers their own rogue agendas. That is how clandestine U.S. government research can sometimes go sour, unless great care is exercised by the oversight committees in the House and the Senate. Sometimes when rogue groups do gain control and total secrecy of a given new technological area, then what appears to be \"U.S. government operations\" do start to encompass a criminal and unethical operations, hidden usually beneath the deep veil of high classification. Also, if it's \"scientific,\" no one is ever brought to justice, even if the \"evil science actions\" are uncovered and publicly revealed. We Certainly Have Proof of Such Rogue Activity. For Example, Here are Two Prominent Cases: 1. For three decades, scientists from the U.S. government, universities, and civilian contractors secretly as a result of those ghoulish experiments. So what happened when this gruesome thing was revealed? Again President Clinton publicly apologized! The head of the Executive Branch did not turn the macabre matter over to his Attorney General to prosecute. How many of these scientists were indicted? Not one. How many are going to be indicted? Not one. Suppose again this had been done by a private doctor in his own private clinic. You get the point. There is Little or No Punishment of Rogue Scientific Groups Shockingly, the U.S. government at the highest level has directly shown (and these are not all such cases by any means!) that mass crimes against U.S. civilians, perpetrated by portions of the U.S. scientific community in direct conspiracy and in secret, will likely be condoned. The perpetrators will not be indicted, tried, or convicted. Note the connection of the \"rogue groups\" thesis to the above incidents. Note how rogue scientific groups got away with it in both these cases. There may be other rogue scientific groups getting away with such things today. They should not be able http://www.cheniere.org/explore%20articles/mind%20control3/p08.htm (1 of 3)24.4.2005 23:49:02"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Mind Control and EM Wave Polarization Transductions conspired to treat unsuspecting human patients with whole body nuclear radiation, including some retarded children and cancer patients. Some of those patients— including some of the retarded children—died as a result. These illegal experiments were conducted in great secrecy, and the results were highly classified. Eventually these actions were revealed, and a Presidential investigation committee investigated. These experiments would seem to be little different from the WWII Nazi and Japanese experiments on human prisoners. Are those U.S. scientists who were responsible for those retarded children's' deaths any different from the Nazi scientists and criminals we executed at Nuremberg? So what happened when this terrible thing finally came out into the open? President Clinton publicly apologized! How many of the responsible scientists were indicted for murder? Not one. None is ever going to be. Suppose a doctor here in South Alabama, with his own private clinic, had secretly irradiated those human patients and retarded children with whole body nuclear radiation, over a period of 30 years, resulting in some agonizing deaths. How many state and federal agencies would have come after him with arrest warrants? Probably about 50 or so. Would he have been indicted, tried, convicted, and executed or sent to prison for life? Absolutely! Would the President of the United States have apologized? Not on your life; he would have turned it over to the U.S. Attorney General with a strong directive to to get away with it. But they can. Perhaps a most startling additional part of those two incidents is that there was no great public outcry from the scientific community, deploring these murders and demanding that the criminal scientists be indicted and tried. As the old saying goes, \"By their silence they have convicted themselves.\" The organized scientific community, as a community, has shown that it has little or no ethics, and—while deploring any scientific murdering that \"gets revealed,\"— is not really interested in justice. In short, much of the U.S. scientific community may now have very little ethics left. We are not talking about normal individual scientists, but the Big Science community. There is a whale of a lot of difference between the two. In the Big Science community, there can be and there are rogue groups. Lots of them. There is deep cover, deep classification. And there is very probably advanced mind control research and testing, be it legal or illegal. Hopefully most of it is legal and constrained. However, some of it is almost certain to be illegal and ill constrained. Human beings are still human beings. All the good and evil is still there, regardless of the group. The stage settings change, but the cast of characters and the play never change. It's sad, but 'twas ever thus.

The result was that attractors precisely indicative of chaos appeared. This positively proves that human systems produce ordered time-structuring of EM. organization of the living matter as the biosphere of the earth. Without specifying the exact technical details, Kaznacheyev discusses the gist of much of what is in this present article. The present author has an autographed copy of Kaznacheyevs book referenced above. 11.

With brilliant insight and intuition far beyond that of science at the time, Pat invented and patented the instrument by the time he was seventeen years old. The neurophone is a device that, contrary to all present theory and knowledge, will directly \"pump the brain\" and reproduce sound and information directly in the brain and mind system, without going through the auditory system at all. A simplified diagram of Pat's improved neurophone is shown in Figure 11. Figure 11.

First the signal is passed into a section that clips everything into a series of square waves, remarkably analogous to the sort of clipped waves Lisitsyn confirms are the information carriers of the human brain. Next the square waves are differentiated, yielding a series of sharp spikes (note that these spikes retain the pulse-time content of the clipped signal). These spikes are again differentiated, and since these are finite spikes with real nonzero rise times and decay times rather than theoretical constructs, a series of noisy spikes results from the second differentiator section. From here, the noisy spikes are introduced to special contact electrodes, one of which is normally placed on the forehead, while the other may be placed almost anywhere, including on the foot. Nowhere are any sound waves introduced to the head. The square-wave clipper section reduces the complex signals, their overtones, and their complex modulations to square waves, retaining the temporal content of the wave mix but not the waves themselves. The first and second differentiators heighten or filter through the temporal content of the higher-order differentiations, that is, they serve as a band pass filter unit to accent the time keying of the neutrinic and mindfield portions or aspects of the signal. When these time spikes are then introduced across the body as pulsed voltages, they are modulated directly on the dendrite firings of the brain and nervous system, providing direct and pulsed modulation of the neutrinic and mindfield component channels of the mind-brain-consciousness-life loop itself. Thus the neurophone directly inputs information into the brain and nervous system, bypassing all the normal sensory systems that lie between the mind-brain loop and the outside environment. Indeed, a similar development has been reported by two University of Missouri researchers. Dr. Donald York, a neurophysiologist, and Dr. Thomas Jensen, a speech pathologist, have recently reported identifying and decoding twenty-seven words and syllables in specific brain wave patterns and correlating these electroencephalographic patterns with both the spoken word and the silently thought word in about forty subjects. At present, Dr. York and Dr. Jensen are programming a computer with a brain wave vocabulary, to monitor and read the EEG of a stroke victim's brain and help stroke victims who have lost their powers of speech to communicate. While all such developments can obviously be misused, their potential for assistance to mankind is enormous. Indeed, my own premise that brain linkage is possible and can be used to advance all mankind to the sixth stage of species evolution is slowly being proven. It is within our reach now to develop a multi-channel communications system that will directly link brains, minds, and consciousness into a single functional being; and I have already pointed out that the psychokinetic power of the emergent entity increases exponentially with the number of linked stages. The normal corpus callosum linkage of the two cerebral halves in each human head proves that brains, minds, and beings can be linked and http://www.cheniere.org/books/excalibur/neurophone.htm (2 of 6)24.4.2005 23:51:59"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE NEUROPHONE integrated into one. The Excalibur Briefing details the basic concepts of the theory involved in hyperspace-virtual state engineering, and thus in the engineering of mind-life-consciousness links to multicellular organisms here on earth. Pat Flanagan's neurophone proves that complex information can be implanted directly in the brain and mind, bypassing the normal isolating barriers. Drs. York and Jensen have shown that the brain wave does indeed contain recognizable, decodable information analogues. Lisitsyn has already reported measuring the number of independent channels involved and has documented the importance of the clipped brain waves as opposed to the sine-wave content. If we have the vision, we can still develop a brainlink and rapidly apply it to link sixty to one hundred persons, thereby opening a conscious, multidimensional \"eye\" for the collective human unconsciousness, gently rousing ZARG into wakefulness, and fulfilling human destiny without undergoing the psychotronic Armageddon planned by the Soviets. The time is short, but it can still be done if the funding, the vision, and the team can be established on a crash priority basis. SOVIET \"WOODPECKER\" SIGNALS But, as I have said, all this can be used for the detriment of mankind as well as for its benefit. Unfortunately, it appears that the Soviet Union has chosen to weaponize the effects on a global scale. A prime example is the \"woodpecker\" signals emanating from the USSR in the 5-30 megahertz region and interfering with communications around the earth. These complex woodpecker signals appear to originate from two or three dozen powerful Soviet transmitters, each with a power estimated as high as 40 megawatts (Figure 12). http://www.cheniere.org/books/excalibur/neurophone.htm (3 of 6)24.4.2005 23:51:59"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE NEUROPHONE Figure 12. The Soviet \"woodpecker\" signals The pioneering experimental measurements of these signals by Dr. Robert Beck and William Bise have shown just how deadly a potential may be possessed by the signals. These measurements have been performed in Eugene and Portland, Oregon; Los Angeles, California; Huntsville, Alabama; and several other locations. They have been particularly significant on the West Coast in and around Eugene, Oregon because of the presence of a direct current transmission line several hundred miles long, which has acted as a long wire antenna, picking up the signals and rebroadcasting them with appreciable gain in the vicinity. Typically the signals may be found on, say, sixteen different carriers between 10 and 20 megahertz. Twelve of the carriers may appear normal, with normal side-bands, and the other four may have the carrier and both sidebands suppressed but still show the biologically significant modulation (for example, 10 hertz). On all sixteen channels a strong 10 hertz modulation may appear, all perfectly time synchronized and in phase channel-to-channel. The received signal from one of these carriers may be twenty-five to thirty times as strong as the earth's back-ground magnetic field, which is oscillating at approximately 7.0 to 7.5 hertz. Other complex modulation frequencies, many of them changing, are present on the various channels. Normally, the brainwaves of mammals in an area are gently entrained by the normal oscillations of the earth's magnetic field and are oscillating along at, say, 7.5 hertz.

These captured brains are now in forced oscillation and are riding along in phase with the 10 hertz Soviet modulation. In other words, a certain percentage of the human brains in an area will phase lock to the 10 hertz modulation, and that will effectively lock into those brains the sixteen carrier frequencies with their concomitant frequency mixes and complex signal modulations. If the signals are made much more powerful (for example, by focusing them onto one particular area or increasing the power of the transmitters), then a much higher percentage of brainwave entrainment can be accomplished in the targeted area. By simply adding on the desired modulation patterns, the Soviets can now pump material directly into the mind-brain-consciousness-life loops of the entrained brains. The weapon implications are enormous: raw emotion such as sheer terror or panic can be transmitted; death or disease patterns of all kinds can be transmitted; informational content (thoughts and ideas) can be impressed directly into the captured brains and minds and processed as if originating inside each brain itself. Indeed, as long as the Soviets keep the effects rather gentle, an entire population can be subtly influenced without governmental notice. Certain specific ELF frequencies can rapidly disable or even kill, and for wartime use those frequencies can be directly implanted in the captured brains themselves by the woodpecker signals. It appears that 1984 came a little early, and one can perhaps now understand Brezhnev's strange 1975 proposal to the SAL T negotiations that we should also consider outlawing the development of new weapons more frightful than the mind of man has ever conceived. The signals also have direct application against strategic targets other than personnel. For example, by incorporating the correct nested modulation pattern, the positron kindling (electron squelching) pattern can be impressed. By beaming through the earth (with a circularly polarized signal or with other complex modulation forms), a beam with a strong neutrinic component, which will squelch electrons and which will interact with great preference for strong voltages or strong magnetic fields, can be directed at a target complex. In the targeted area aircraft and communications systems can be disabled; automobile, truck, and other ignition systems will fail; power transformers and large motors and generators will fail; power transmission systems with their associated high voltages will fail; and so on. Even independent, self-contained emergency power equipment, such as at military installations and strategic missile sites, will fail to operate. Further, to some of these signals, the earth and the sea are as transparent as glass, and so underwater nuclear submarines can be electrically disabled on station before their missiles can be fired, while strategic missile complexes can be electrically disabled before their deadly nuclear missiles can be hurled toward their distant targets. If some submarines and land complexes succeed in firing missiles before being disabled, these missiles can be electrically dudded and scrubbed from the sky over Soviet territory while http://www.cheniere.org/books/excalibur/neurophone.htm (5 of 6)24.4.2005 23:51:59"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE NEUROPHONE still far from their intended targets.
