Y. — May 25, 1889 To the Editor of The Electrical World: Sir: About a year ago I had the pleasure of bringing before the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers the results of some of my work on alternatecurrent motors. They were received with the interest which novel ideas neverfail to excite in scientific circles, and elicited considerable comment. Withtruly American generosity, for which, on my part, I am ever thankful, a greatdeal of praise through the columns of your esteemed paper and other journals hasbeen bestowed upon the originator of the idea, in itself insignificant. At thattime it was impossible for me to bring before the Institute other results in thesame line of thought. Moreover, I did not think it probable — considering thenovelty of the idea — that anybody else would be likely to pursue work in thesame direction. By one of the most curious coincidences, however, ProfessorFerraris not only came independently to the same theoretical results, but in amanner identical almost to the smallest detail. Far from being disappointed atbeing prevented from calling the discovery of the principle exclusively my own,I have been excessively pleased to see my views, which I had formed and carriedout long before, confirmed by this eminent man, to whom I consider myself happyto be related in spirit, and toward whom, ever since the knowledge of the factshas reached me, I have entertained feelings of the most sincere sympathy andesteem. In his able essay Prof. Ferraris omitted to mention various other waysof accomplishing similar results, some of which have later been indicated by 0.B. Shallenberger, who some time before the publication of the results obtainedby Prof. Ferraris and myself had utilized the principle in the construction ofhis now well known alternate current meter, and at a still later period by Prof.Elihu Thomson and Mr. M. J. Wightman. Since the original publications, for obvious reasons, little has been madeknown in regard to the further progress of the invention; nevertheless the workof perfecting has been carried on indefatigably with all the intelligent helpand means which a corporation almost unlimited in its resources could command,and marked progress has been made in every direction. It is therefore notsurprising that many unacquainted with this fact, in expressing their views asto the results obtained, have grossly erred. In your issue of May 4, I find a communication from the electricians of Ganz& Co., of Budapest, relating to certain results observed in recent experimentswith a novel form of alternate current motor. I would have nothing to say inregard to this communication unless it were to sincerely congratulate thesegentlemen on any good results which they may have obtained, but for the article,seemingly inspired by them, which appeared in the London Electrical Review ofApril 26, wherein certain erroneous views are indorsed and some radically falseassertions made, which, though they may be quite unintentional, are such as tocreate prejudice and affect material interests. As to the results presented, they not only do not show anythingextraordinary, but are, in fact, considerably below some figures obtained withmy motors a long time ago. The main stress being laid upon the propositionbetween the apparent and real energy supplied, or perhaps more directly, uponthe ratio of the energy apparently supplied to, and the real energy developedby, the motor, I will here submit, with your permission, to your readers, theresults respectively arrived at by these gentlemen and myself. Energy apparentlysupplied in watts. Work performed in watts. Ratio of energy apparently supplied to the real energy developed. Ganz & Co. Westinghouse Co. Ganz & Co. Westinghouse Co. Ganz & Co. Westinghouse Co. 18,000 21,840 11,000 17,595 0.611 0.805 24,200 30,295 14,600 25,365 0.603 0.836 29,800 43,624 22,700 36,915 0.761 0.816 ...... 56,800 ...... 48,675 ..... 0.856 ...... 67,500 ...... 59,440 ..... 0.88 ...... 79,100 ...... 67,365 ..... 0.851 If we compare these figures we will find that the most favorable ratio inGanz & Co’s motor is 0.761, whereas in the Westinghouse, for about the sameload, it is 0.836, while in other instances, as may be seen, it is still morefavorable. Notwithstanding this, the conditions of the test were not such as towarrant the best possible results. The factors upon which the apparent energy is mainly dependent could havebeen better determined by a proper construction of the motor and observance ofcertain conditions. In fact, with such a motor a current regulation may beobtained which, for all practical purposes, is as good as that of the directcurrent motors, and the only disadvantage, if it be one, is that when the motoris running without load the apparent energy cannot be reduced quite as low asmight be desirable. For instance, in the case of this motor the smallest amountof apparent energy was about 3,000 watts, which is certainly not very much for amachine capable of developing 90 h. p. of work; besides, the amount could havebeen reduced very likely to 2,000 watts or less. On the other hand, these motors possess the beautiful feature of maintainingan absolutely constant speed no matter how the load may vary. This feature maybe illustrated best by the following experiment performed with this motor. Themotor was run empty, and a load of about 200 h. p.., far exceeding the normalload, was thrown on suddenly. Both armatures of the motor and generator wereseen to stop for an instant, the belts slipping over the pulleys, whereupon bothcame up to the normal speed with the full load, not having been thrown out ofsynchronism. The experiment could be repeated any number of times. In somecases, the driving power being sufficient, I have been enabled to throw on aload exceeding 8 to 9 times that which the motor was designed to carry, withoutaffecting the speed in the least. This will be easily understood from the manner in which the currentregulation is effected. Assuming the motor to be running without any load, thepoles of the armature and field have a certain relative position which is thatof the highest self-induction or counter electromotive force. If load be thrownon, the poles are made to recede; the self-induction or counter electromotiveforce is thereby diminished and more current passed trough the stationary ormovable armature-coils. This regulation is very different from that of a directcurrent motor. In the latter the current is varied by the motor losing a certainnumber of revolutions in proportion to the load, and the regulation would beimpossible if the speed would be maintained constant; here the whole regulationis practically effected during a fraction of one revolution only. From this itis also apparent that it is a practical impossibility to throw such a motor outof synchronism, as the whole work must be done in an instant, it being evidentthat if the load is not sufficient to make a motor lose a fraction of the firstrevolution it will not be able to do so in the succeeding revolutions. As to theefficiency of these motors, it is perfectly practicable to obtain 94 to 95 percent. The results above given were obtained on a three-wire system. The same motorhas been started and operated on two wires in a variety of ways, and although itwas not capable of performing quite as much work as on three wires, up to about60 h. p. it gave results practically the same as those above-mentioned. Infairness to the electricians of Ganz & Co., I must state here that the speed ofthis motor was higher than that used in their experiments, it being about 1,500.I cannot make due allowance for this difference, as the diameter of the armatureand other particulars of the Ganz & Co. motor were not given. The motor tested had a weight of about 5,000 lbs. From this it will be seenthat the performance even on two wires was quite equal to that of the bestdirect current motors. The motor being of a synchronous type, it might beimplied that it was not capable of starting. On the contrary, however, it had aconsiderable torque on the start and was capable of starting under fair load. In the article above referred to the assertion is made that the weight ofsuch alternate current motor, for a given capacity, is \"several times\" largerthan that of a direct current motor. In answer to this I will state here that wehave motors which with a weight of about 850 pounds develop 10 h. p. with anefficiency of very nearly 90 per cent, and the spectacle of a direct currentmotor weighing, say 200 – 300 pounds and performing the same work, would be verygratifying for me to behold. The motor which I have just mentioned had nocommutator or brushes of any kind nor did it require any direct current. Finally, in order to refute various assertions made at random, principally inthe foreign papers, I will take the liberty of calling to the attention of thecritics the fact that since the discovery of the principle several types ofmotors have been perfected and of entirely different characteristics, eachsuited for a special kind of work, so that while one may be preferable onaccount of its ideal simplicity, another might be more efficient. It isevidently impossible to unite all imaginable advantages in one form, and it isequally unfair and unreasonable to judge all different forms according to acommon standard. Which form of the existing motors is best, time will show; buteven in the present state of the art we are enabled to satisfy any possibledemand in practice. Nikola Tesla Pittsburgh, Pa. The Losses Due to Hysteresis in Transformers The Electrical Engineer - N. Y. — April 9, 1890 In your issue of April 2, in referring to certain remarks made by me at therecent meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on the subjectof hysteresis you make the statement: \"It is this constancy of relation that, asMr. Tesla pointed out may ultimately establish the correctness of the hypothesisadvanced, that in reality there is no loss due to hysteresis, and that thechanges of magnetization represent a charging and discharging of molecularenergy without entailing an actual expenditure of energy.\" I do not recollect having made such a statement, and as I was evidentlymisunderstood, you will greatly oblige me in inserting the following few lines,which express the idea I meant to advance: Up to the present no satisfactory explanation of the causes of hysteresis hasbeen given. In the most exhaustive and competent treatise on the theory oftransformers, by Fleming, static hysteresis is explained by supposing that \"themagnetic molecules or molecular magnets, the arrangement of which constitutesmagnetization, move stiffly, and the dissipation of energy is the work done inmaking the necessary magnetic displacement against a sort of magnetic friction.\"Commonly it is stated that this is a distinct element in the loss of energy inan iron core undergoing magnetic changes entirely independent of any currentsgenerated therein. Now it is difficult to reconcile these views with our present notions on theconstitution of matter generally. The molecules or iron cannot be connectedtogether by anything but elastic forces, since they are separated by anintervening elastic medium through which the forces act; and this being the caseis it not reasonable to assume that if a given amount of energy is taken up tobring the molecules out of their original position an equivalent amount ofenergy should be restored by the molecules reassuming their original positions,as we know is the case in all molecular displacements? We cannot imagine that anappreciable amount of energy should be wasted by the elastically connectedmolecules swinging back and forth from their original positions, which they mustconstantly tend to assume, at least within the limit of elasticity, which in allprobability is rarely surpassed. The losses cannot be attributed to meredisplacement, as this would necessitate the supposition that the molecules areconnected rigidly, which is quite unthinkable. A current cannot act upon the particles unless it acts upon currents in thesame, either previously existing or set up by it, and since the particles areheld together by elastic forces the losses must be ascribed wholly to thecurrent generated. The remarkable discovery of Ewing that the magnetization isgreater on the descent than on the ascent for the same values of magnetizingforce strongly points to the fact that hysteresis is intimately connected withthe generation of currents either in the molecules individually or in groups ofthem through the space intervening. The fact observed accords perfectly with ourexperience on current induction, for we know that on the descent any current setup must be of the same direction with the inducing current, and, therefore, mustjoin with the same in producing a common effect; whereas, on the ascent thecontrary is the case. Dr. Duncan stated that the ratio of increase of primary and secondary currentis constant. This statement is, perhaps, not sufficiently expressive, for notonly is the ratio constant but, obviously, the differential effect of primaryand secondary is constant. Now any current generated - molecular or Foucaultcurrents in the mass - must be in amount proportionate to the difference of theinductive effect of the primary and secondary, since both currents addalgebraically - the ratio of windings duly considered, - and as this differenceis constant the loss, if wholly accounted for in this manner, must be constant.Obviously I mean here the transformers under consideration, that is, those witha closed magnetic circuit, and I venture to say that the above will be morepronounced when the primary and secondary are wound one on top of the other thanwhen they are wound side by side; and generally it will be the more pronouncedthe closer their inductive relation. Dr. Duncan’s figures also show that the loss is proportionate to the squareof the electromotive force. Again this ought to be so, for an increasedelectromotive force causes a proportionately increased current which, inaccordance with the above statements, must entail a loss in the proportion ofthe square. Certainly, to account for all the phenomena of hysteresis, effects ofmechanical vibration, the behavior of steel and nickel alloy, etc., a number ofsuppositions must be made; but can it not be assumed that, for instance, in thecase of steel and nickel alloys the dissipation of energy is modified by themodified resistance; and to explain the apparent inconsistency of this view weonly need to remember that the resistance of a body as a whole is not a measureof the degree of conductivity of the particles of which it is composed. N. Tesla New York City Swinburne’s \"Hedgehog\" TransformerThe Electrical Engineer - N. Y. — Sept. 24, 1890 Some time ago Mr. Swinburne advanced certain views on transformers which haveelicited some comment. In The Electrical Engineer of Sept. 10. there are broughtout further arguments on behalf of his open circuit, or, as he calls it,\"hedgehog\" transformer, claiming for this type a higher average efficiency thanis attainable with the closed circuit forms. In regard to this, I say withGoethe, Die Botschaft hör’ ich wohl, allein mir fehlt der Glaube — I hear themessage, but I lack belief.\" Many of Mr. Swinburne’s arguments are in my opinion erroneous. He says: \"Incalculating the efficiencies of transformers, the loss in the iron has generallybeen left completely out of account, and the loss in copper alone considered;hence, the efficiencies of 97 and 98 per cent. claimed for closed iron circuitforms.\" This is a statement little complimentary to those who have made suchestimates, and perhaps Mr. Swinburne would be very much embarrassed to citenames on behalf of his argument. He assumes the loss in the iron in the closedcircuit forms to be 10 per cent. of the full load, and further \"that in moststations the average use of lamps is less than two hours a day, including alllamps installed,\" and arrives at some interesting figures in regard toefficiency. Mr. Swinburne seems not to be aware of the improvements made in theiron. The loss with the best quality of iron will, I believe, not reach 8 percent. of the full load by an intelligent use of the transformer, and there is nodoubt that further improvements will be made in that direction. As regards the second part of his assumption, I think that it is exaggerated.It must be remembered that in most central stations or large plants due care istaken that the load is favorably distributed and in many cases the wiring issuch that entire circuits may be shut off at certain hours so that there isduring these hours no loss whatever in the transformers.’ In his \"hedgehog\" form of transformer Mr. Swinburne reduces the ironconsiderably and comes to the conclusion that even in small transformers theiron loss is under one per cent. of the full load, while in the closed circuitforms, it is, according to him, 10 per cent. It would strengthen this argumentif the iron would be dispensed with altogether. Mr. Swinburne does notappreciate fully the disadvantages which the open circuit form, operated at theusual period, entails. In order that the loss in tire iron should be reduced toone-tenth, it is necessary to reduce the weight of the iron core to one-tenthand subject every unit length of the same to the same magnoto-motive force. If ahigher magneto-motive force is used the loss in the core will — within certainlimits, at least — be proportionate to the square of tire magneto-motive force.The remark of Mr. Swinburne, \"If the iron circuit is opened, the aides of theembracing core can be removed, so the loss by hysteresis is divided by three,\"is therefore not true; the loss will be divided by -> where F1>F. If the iron of the open circuit form is made up in a closed ring theadvantage will be at once apparent, for, since the magnetic resistance will bemuch reduced, the magneto-motive force required will be correspondingly smaller.It is probable that, say, four Swinburne transformers may be joined in such away as to form a closed magnetic circuit. In this case the amount of iron andcopper would remain the same, but an advantage will be gained as as the totalmagnetic resistance will be diminished. The four transformers will now demandless excitation and since — under otherwise equal conditions — the gain dependson the square of the existing current, it in by no means insignificant. From theabove comparison it is evident that the core of such open circuit transformershould be very short, by far shorter than it appears from the cut in TheElectrical Engineer. Mr. Swinburne is in error as to the motives which have caused the tendency toshorten the magnetic circuit in closed circuit transformers. It was principallyon account of practical considerations and not to reduce the magneticresistance, which has little to do with efficiency. If a ring be made of, say,10 centimeters mean length and 10 square centimeters cross section, .and if itbe wound all over with the primary and secondary wires, it will be found that itwill give the best result with a certain number of alternations. If, now, a ringis made of the same quality of iron but having, say, 20 centimeters mean lengthand 10 square centimeters section it will give again the best result with thesame number of alternations, and the efficiency will be the same as before,provided that the ring is wound all over with the primary and secondary wires.The space inside of the ring will, in the second case, be increased inproportion to the square of the diameter, and there will be no difficulty inwinding on it all the wire required. So the length may be indefinitely increasedand a transformer of any capacity made, as long as the ring is completelycovered by the primary and secondary wires. If the wires be wound side by side the ring of smaller diameter will give abetter result, and the same will be the case if a certain fraction of the ringis not covered by the wires. It then becomes important to shorten the magneticcircuit. But, since in practice it is necessary to enclose the transformer in acasting, if such a ring be trade, it would have to be protected with a layer oflaminated iron, which would increase the cost and loss. It may be inclosed injars of some, insulating material, as Mr. Swinburne does, belt this is lesspracticable. Owing to this, the constructors of the most practical forms, such, forinstance, as the Westinghouse transformer, to which the Swinburne reasoningapplies, have been prompted to enclose the wires as much as possible with thelaminated iron, and then it became important to shorted the magnetic circuit,because in this form only a part of the magnetic circuit is surrounded by thewires, as well as for other practical considerations. In practice it is desirable to get along with the least length of copperconductor on account of cheapness and regulation. Mr. Swinburne states that inhis transformer the loss in iron is under one per cent. of the full load; allthe balance of loss must, therefore, be in the copper. But since, according tohim, the wires are of larger section, his transformer can hardly be animprovement in that direction. The gun-metal casting is also objectionable.There is no doubt some loss going on in the came, and beside, it increases theresistance of the wires by a factor> where S is the total cross-section of the core and S1 the section of the ironwires. There is one important point which seems to have escaped Mr. Swinburne’sattention. Whether the open circuit transformer is an improvement, or not, willdepend principally on the period. The experience of most electrical engineershas resulted in the adoption of the closed-circuit transformer. I believe that Iwas the first to advocate in open circuit form, but to improve its efficiency Ihad to use a much higher period; at usual periods the, closed circuit form ispreferable. Mr. Swinburne makes some other obscure statements upon which I need notdwell, as they have no bearing on the main question. Tesla’s New Alternating Motors The Electrical Engineer - N. Y. — Sept. 24, 1890 I hope you will allow me the privilege, to say in the columns of youresteemed journal a few words in regard to an article which appeared inIndustries of August 22, to which my attention has been called. In this articlean attempt is made to criticize some of my inventions, notably those which youhave described in your issue of August 6, 1890. The writer begins by stating: \"The motor depends on a shifting of the polesunder certain conditions, a principle which has been already employed by Mr. A.Wright in his alternating current meter.\" This is no surprise to me. It wouldrather have surprised me to learn that Mr. Wright has not yet employed theprinciple in his meter, considering what, before its appearance, was known of mywork on motors, and more particularly of that of Schallenberger on meters. Ithas cost me years of thought to arrive at certain results, by many believed tobe unattainable), for which there are now numerous claimants, and the number ofthese is rapidly increasing, like that of the colonels in the South after thewar. The writer then good-naturel explains the theory of action of the motivedevice in Wright’s meter, which has greatly benefited me, for it is so longsince I have arrived at this, and similar theories, that I had almost forgottenit. He then says: \" Mr. Tesla has worked out some more or less complicatedmotors on this principle, but the curious point is that he has completelymisunderstood the theory of the phenomena, and has got hold of (the old fallacyof screening.\" This may be curious, but how much more curious it is to find thatthe writer in Industries has completely misunderstood everything himself. I likenothing better than just criticism of my work, even if it be severe, but whenthe critic assumes a certain \" l’état c’est moi\" air of unquestioned CompetencyI want him to know what he is writing about. How little the writer in Industriesseems to know about the matter is painfully apparent when ho connects thephenomenon in Wright’s meter with the subject he has under consideration. Hisfurther remark, \"He (Mr. Tesla) winds his secondary of iron instead of copperand thinks the effect is produced magnetically,\" is illustrative of the carewith which he has perused the description of the devices contained in the issueof The Electrical Engineer above referred to. I take a motor having, say eight poles, and wrap the exciting coils of fouralternate cores with fine insulated iron wire. When the current is started inthese coils it encounters the effect of the closed magnetic circuit and isretarded. The magnetic lines set up at the start close to the iron wire aroundthe coils and no free poles appear at first at the ends of the four cores. Asthe current rises in the coils more lines are set up, which crowd more and morein the fine iron wire until finally the same becomes saturated, or nearly so,when the shielding action of the iron wire ceases and free poles appear at theends of the four protected cores. The effect of the iron wire, as will be seen,is two-fold. First, it retards the energizing current; and second, it delays theappearance of the free poles. To produce still greater difference of phase inthe magnetization of the protected and unprotected cores, I connect the ironwire surrounding the coils of the former in series with the coils of the latter,in which case, of course, the iron wire is preferably wound or connecteddifferentially, after the fashion of the resistance, coils in a bridge, so as tohave no appreciable self-induction. In other cases I obtain the desiredretardation in the appearance of the free poles on one set of cores by amagnetic shunt, which produces a greater retardation of the current and takes upat the start a certain number of the lines set up, but becomes saturated whenthe current in the exciting coils reaches a predetermined strength. In the transformer the same principle of shielding is utilized. A primaryconductor is surrounded with a fine layer of laminated iron, consisting of fineiron wire or plates properly insulated and interrupted. As long as the currentin the primary conductor is so small that the iron enclosure can carry all thelines of force set up by the current, there is very little action exerted upon asecondary conductor placed in vicinity to the first; but just as soon as theiron enclosure becomes saturated, or nearly so, it loses the virtue ofprotecting the secondary and the inducing action of the primary practicallybegins. What, may I ask, has all this to do with the \"old fallacy of screening?\" With certain objects in view — the enumeration of which would lead me too far— an arrangement was shown in The Electrical Engineer, about which the writer inIndustries says : \" A ring of laminated iron is wound with a secondary. It isthen encased in iron laminated in the wrong direction and the primary is woundoutside of this. The layer of iron between the primary and secondary is supposedto screen the coil. Of course it cannot do so, such a thing Is unthinkable.\"This reminds me of the man who had committed some offense and engaged theservices of an attorney. \"They cannot commit you to prison for that,\" said theattorney. Finally the man was imprisoned. He sent for the attorney. \" Sir,\" saidthe latter, \" I tell you they cannot imprison you for that.\" \"But, sir,\"retorted the prisoner, \"they have imprisoned me.\" It may not screen, in theopinion of the writer in Industries, but just the same it does. According to thearrangement the principal effect of the screen may be either a retardation ofthe action of the primary current upon the secondary circuit or a deformation ofthe secondary current wave with similar results for the purposes intended. Inthe arrangement referred to by the writer in Industries be seems to be certainthat the iron layer acts like a choking coil; there again he is mistaken; itdoes not act like a choking coil, for then its capacity for maintaining constantcurrent would be very limited. But it acts more like a magnetic shunt inconstant current transformers and dynamos, as, in my opinion, it ought to act. There are a good many more things to be said about the remarks contained inIndustries. In regard to the magnetic time lag the writer says: \" If a bar ofiron has a coil at one end, and if the core is perfectly laminated, on startinga current in the coil the induction all along the iron corresponds to theexcitation at that instant, unless there is a microscopic time lag, of whichthere is no evidence.\" Yet a motor was described, the very operation of which isdependent on the time lag of magnetization of the different parts of a core. Itis true the writer uses the term \"perfectly laminated\" (which, by the way, Iwould like him to explain), but if he intends to make such a \"perfectlylaminated\" core I venture to say there is trouble in store for him. From hisremarks I see that the writer completely overlooks the importance of the size ofthe core and of the number of the alternations pointed out; be fails to see thestress laid on the saturation of the screen, or shunt, in some of the casesdescribed; he does not seem to recognize the fact that in the cases consideredthe formation of current is reduced as far as practicable in the screen, andthat the same, therefore, so far as its quality of screening is concerned, hasno role to perform as a conductor. I also see that he would want considerableinformation about the time lag in the magnetization of the different parts of acore, and an explanation why, in the transformer he refers to, the screen islaminated in the wrong direction, etc. — but the elucidation of all these pointswould require more time than I am able to devote to the subject. It isdistressing to find all this in the columns of a leading technical journal. In conclusion, the writer shows his true colors by making the followingwithering remarks: \"It is questionable whether the Tesla motor will ever be asuccess. Such motors will go round, of course, and will give outputs, but theirefficiency is doubtful; and if they need three-wire circuits and specialgenerators there is no object in using them, as a direct current motor can berun instead with advantage.\" No man of broad views will feel certain of the success of any invention,however good and original, in this period of feverish activity, when every daymay bring new and unforseen developments. At the pace we are progressing thepermanence of all our apparatus it its present forms becomes more and moreproblematical. It is impossible to foretell what type of motor will crystalizeout of the united efforts of many able men; but it is my conviction that at nodistant time a motor having commutator and brushes will be looked upon as anantiquated piece of mechanism. Just how much the last quoted remarks of thewriter of Industries — considering the present state of the art — are justified,I will endeavor to show in a few lines. First, take the transmission of power in isolated places. A case frequentlyoccurring in practice and attracting more and more the attention of engineers isthe transmission of large powers at considerable distances. In such a case thepower is very likely to be cheap, and the cardinal requirements are then thereduction of the cost of the leads, cheapness of construction and maintenance ofmachinery and constant speed of the motors. Suppose a loss of only 25 per centin the leads, at full load, be allowed. If a direct current motor be used, therewill be, besides other difficulties, considerable variation in the speed of themotor — even if the current is supplied from a series dynamo — so much so thatthe motor may not be well adapted for many purposes, for instance, in caseswhere direct current transformation is contemplated with the object of runninglights or other devices at constant potential. It is true that the condition maybe bettered by employing proper regulating devices, but these will only furthercomplicate the already complex system, and in all probability fail to securesuch perfection as will be desired. In using an ordinary single-circuitalternate current motor the disadvantage is that the motor has no startingtorque and that, for equal weight, its output and efficiency are more or lessbelow that of a direct current motor. If, on the contrary, the armature of anyalternator or direct current machine — large, low-speed, two-pole machines willgive the best results — is wound with two circuits, a motor is at once obtainedwhich possesses sufficient torque to start under considerable load: it runs inabsolute synchronism with the generator — an advantage much desired and hardlyever to be attained with regulating devices; it takes current in proportion tothe load, and its plant efficiency within a few per cent is equal to that of adirect current motor of the same size. It will be able, however, to perform morework than a direct current motor of the same size, first, because there will beno change of speed, even if the load be doubled or tripled, within the limits ofavailable generator power; and second, because it can be run at a higherelectromotive force, the commutator and the complication and difficulties itinvolves in the construction and operation of the generators and motors beingeliminated from the system. Such a system will, of course, require three leads,but since the plant efficiency is practically equal to that of the directcurrent system, it will require the same amount of copper which would berequired in the latter system, and the disadvantage of the third lead will becomparatively small, if any, for three leads of smaller size may perhaps be moreconvenient to place than two larger leads. When more machines have to be usedthere may be no disadvantage whatever connected with the third wire ; however,since the simplicity of the generators and motors allows the use of higherelectromotive forces, the cost of the leads may be reduced below the figurepracticable with the direct current system. Considering all the practical advantages offered by such an alternatingsystem, I am of an opinion quite contrary to that of the author of the articlein Industries, and think that it can quite successfully stand the competition ofany direct current system, and this the more, the larger the machines built andthe greater the distances. Another case frequently occurring in practice is the transmission of smallpowers in numerous isolated places, such as mines, etc. In many of these casessimplicity and reliability of the apparatus are the principal objects. I believethat in many places of this kind my motor has so far proved a perfect success.In such cases a type of motor is used possessing great starting torque,requiring for its operation only alternating current and having no slidingcontacts whatever on the armature, this advantage over other types of motorsbeing highly valued in such places. The plant efficiency of this form of motoris, in the present state of perfection, inferior to that of the former form, butI am confident that improvements will be made in that direction. Be-sides, plantefficiency is in these cases of secondary importance, and in cases oftransmission at considerable distances, it is no drawback, since theelectromotive force may be raised as high as practicable on converters. I cannot lay enough stress on this advantageous feature of my motors, and shouldthink that it ought to be fully appreciated by engineers, for to highelectromotive forces we are surely coming, and if they must be used, then thefittest apparatus will be employed. I believe that in the transmission of powerwith such commutatorless machines, 10,000 volts, and even more, may be used, andI would be glad to see Mr. Ferranti’s enterprise succeed. His work is in theright direction, and, in my opinion, it will be of great value for theadvancement of the art. As regards the supply of power from large central stations in cities orcenters of manufacture, the above arguments are applicable, and I see no reasonwhy the three-wire motor system should not be successful. In putting up such astation, the third wire would be but a very slight drawback, and the systempossesses enough advantages to over-balance this and any other disadvantage. Butthis question will be settled in the future, for as yet comparatively little hasbeen done in that direction, even with the direct current system. The plantefficiency of such a three-wire system would be increased by using, inconnection with the ordinary type of my motor, other types which act more likeinert resistances. The plant efficiency of the whole system would, in all cases,be greater than that of each individual motor — if like motors are used — owingto the fact that they would possess different self-induction, according to theload. The supply of power from lighting mains is, I believe, in the opinion of mostengineers, limited to comparatively small powers, for obvious reasons. As thepresent systems are built on the two-wire plan, an efficient two-wire motorwithout commutator is required for this purpose, and also for traction purposes.A large number of these motors, embodying new principles, have been devised byme and are being constantly perfected. On lighting stations, however, mythree-wire system may be advantageously carried out. A third wire may be run formotors and the old connections left undisturbed. The armatures of the generatorsmay be rewound, whereby the output of the machines will be increased about 35per cent, or even more in machines with cast iron field magnets. If the machinesare worked at the same capacity, this means an increased efficiency. If power isavailable at the station, the gain in current may be used in motors. Those whoobject to the third wire, may remember that the old two-wire direct system isalmost entirely superseded by the three-wire system, yet my three-wire systemoffers to the alternating system relatively greater advantages, than thethree-wires direct possesses over the two-wire. Perhaps, if the writer inIndustries would have taken all this in consideration, he would have been lesshasty in his conclusions. Nikola Tesla New York Sept. 17, 1890 Experiments with Alternating Currents of High Frequency The Electrical Engineer - N. Y. — March. 18, 1891 In The Electrical Engineer issue of 11th inst., I find a note of Prof. ElihuThomson relating to some of my experiments with alternating currents of veryhigh frequency. Prof. Thomson calls the attention of your readers to the interesting factthat he has performed some experiments in the same line. I was not quiteunprepared to hear this, as a letter from him has appeared in the Electrician afew months ago, in which he mentions a small alternate current machine which wascapable of giving, I believe, 5,000 alternations per second, from which letterit likewise appears that his investigations on that subject are of a more recentdate. Prof. Thomson describes an experiment with a bulb enclosing a carbon filamentwhich was brought to incandescence by the bombardment of the molecules of theresidual gas when the bulb was immersed in water. \"rendered slightly conductingby salt dissolved therein,\" (?) and a potential of 1,000 volts alternating 5,000time a second applied to the carbon strip. Similar experiments have, of course,been performed by many experimenters, the only distinctive feature in Prof.Thomson’s experiment being the comparatively high rate of alternation. Theseexperiments can also be performed with a steady difference of potential betweenthe water and the carbon strip in which case, of course, conduction through theglass takes place, the difference of potential required being in proportion tothe thickness of the glass. With 5,000 alternations per second, conduction stilltakes place, but the condenser effect is preponderating. It goes, of course,without saying that the healing of the glass in such a case is principally dueto the bombardment of the molecules, partly also to leakage or conduction, butit is an undeniable fact that the glass may also be heated merely by themolecular displacement. The interesting feature in ray experiments was that alamp would light up when brought near to an induction coil, and that it could beheld in the hand and the filament brought to incandescence. Experiments of the kind described I have followed up for a long time withsome practical objects in view. In connection with the experiment described byProf. Thomson, if may be of interest to mention a very pretty phenomenon whichmay be observed with an incandescent lamp. If a lamp be immersed in water as faras practicable and the filament and the vessel connected to the terminals of aninduction coil operated from a machine such as I have used in my experiments,one may see the dull red filament surrounded by a very luminous globe aroundwhich there is a less luminous space. The effect is probably due to reflection,as the globe is sharply defined, but may also be due to a \"dark space;\" at anyrate it is so pretty that it must be seen to be appreciated. Prof. Thomson has misunderstood my statement about the limit of audition. Iwas perfectly well aware of the fact that opinions differ widely on this point.Nor was I surprised to find that arcs of about 10,000 impulses per second, emita sound. My statement \" the curious point is,\" etc. was only made in deferenceto an opinion expressed by Sir William Thomson. There was absolutely no stresslaid on the precise number. The popular belief was that something like 10,000 to20,000 per second, or 20,000 to 40,000, at the utmost was the limit. For myargument this was immaterial. I contended that sounds of an incomparably greaternumber, that is, many times even the highest number, could be heard if theycould be produced with sufficient power. My statement was only speculative, butI have devised means which I think may allow me to learn something definite onthat point. I have not the least doubt that it is simply a question of power. Avery short arc may be silent with 10,000 per second, but just as soon as it islengthened it begins to emit a sound. The vibrations are the same in number, butmore powerful. Prof. Thomson states that I am taking as the limit of \" audition sounds from5,000 to 10,000 complete waves per second.\" There is nothing in my statementsfrom which the above could be inferred, but Prof. Thomson has perhaps notthought that there are two sound vibrations for each complete current wave, theformer being independent of the direction of the current. I am glad to learn that Prof. Thomson agrees with me as to the causes of thepersistence of the arc. Theoretical considerations considerable time since haveled me to the belief that arcs produced by currents of such high frequency wouldpossess this and other desirable features. One of my objects in this directionhas been to produce a practicable small arc. With these, currents, for manyreasons, much smaller arcs are practicable. The interpretation by Prof. Thomson of my statements about the arc systemleads me now, he will pardon me for saying so, to believe that what is mostessential to the success of an arc system is a good management. Nevertheless Ifeel confident of the correctness of the views expressed. The conditions inpractice are so manifold that it is impossible for any type of machine to provebest in all the different conditions. In one case, where the circuit is many miles long, it is desirable to employthe most efficient machine with the least internal resistance ; in another casesuch a machine would not be the best to employ. It will certainly be admittedthat a machine of any type must have a greater resistance if intended to operatearc lights than if it is designed to supply incandescent lamps in series. Whenarc lights are operated and the resistance is small, the lamps are unsteady,unless a type of lamp is employed in which the carbons are separated by amechanism which has no further influence upon the feed, the feeding beingeffected by an independent mechanism ; but even in this case the resistance mustbe considerably greater to allow a quiet working of the lamps. Now, if themachine be such as to yield a steady current, there is no way of attaining thedesired result except by putting the required resistance somewhere either insideor outside of the machine. The latter is hardly practicable, for the customermay stand a hot machine, but he looks with suspicion upon a hot resistance box.A good automatic regulator of course improves the machine and allows us toreduce the internal resistance to some extent, but not as far as would bedesirable. Now, since resistance is loss, we can advantageously replaceresistance in the machine by an equivalent impedance. But to produce a greatimpedance with small ohmic resistance, it is necessary to have self-inductionand variation of current, and the greater the self-induction and the rate ofchange of the current, the greater the impedance may be made, while the ohmicresistance may be very small. It may also be remarked that the impedance of thecircuit external to the machine is likewise increased. As regards the increasein ohmic resistance in consequence of the variation of the current, the same is,in the commercial machines now in use, very small. Clearly then a greatadvantage is gained by providing self induction in the machine circuit andundulating the current, for it is possible to replace a machine which has aresistance of, say, 16 ohms by one which has no more than 2 or 3 ohms, and thelights will work even steadier. It seems to me therefore, that my saying thatself-induction is essential to the commercial success of an arc system isjustified. What is still more important, such a machine will cost considerablyless. But to realize fully the benefits, it is preferably to employ an alternatecurrent machine, as in this case a greater rate of change in the current isobtainable. Just what the ratio of resistance to impedance is in the Brush andThomson machines is nowhere stated, but I think that it is smaller in the Brushmachine, judging from its construction. As regards the better working of clutch lamps with undulating currents, thereis, according to my experience, not the least doubt about it. I have proved iton a variety of lamps to the complete satisfaction not only of myself, but ofmany others. To see the improvement in the feed and to the jar of the clutch atits best it is desirable to employ a lamp in which an independent clutchmechanism effects the feed, and the release of the rod is independent of the upand down movement. In such a lamp the clutch has a small inertia and is verysensitive to vibration, whereas, if the feed is effected by the up and downmovement of the lever carrying the rod, the inertia of the system is so greatthat it is not affected as much by vibration, especially if, as in many cases, adash pot is employed. During the year 1885 I perfected such a lamp which wancalculated to be operated with undulating currents. With about 1,500 to 1,800current impulses per minute the feed of this lamp is such that absolutely nomovement of the rod can be observed, even if the arc be magnified fifty-fold bymeans of a lens; whereas, if a steady current is employed, the lamp feeds bysmall steps. I have, however, demonstrated this feature on other types of lamps,among them being a derived circuit lamp such as Prof. Thomson refers to. Iconceived the idea of such a lamp early in 1884, and when my first company wasstarted, this was the first lamp I perfected. It was not until the lamp wasready for manufacture that, on receiving copies of applications from the PatentOffice, I learned for the first time, not having had any knowledge of the stateof the art in America, that Prof. Thomson had anticipated me and had obtainedmany patents on this principle, which, of course, greatly disappointed andembarrassed me at that time. I observed the improvement of the feed withundulating currents on that lamp, but I recognized the advantage of providing alight and independent clutch unhampered in its movements. Circumstances did notallow me to carry out at that time some designs of machines I had in mind, andwith the existing machines the lamp has worked at a great disadvantage. I cannotagree with Prof. Thomson that small vibrations would benefit a clockwork lamp asmuch as a clutch lamp; in fact, I think that they do not at all benefit aclockwork lamp. It would be interesting to learn the opinion of Mr. Charles F. Brush on thesepoints. Prof. Thomson states that he has run with perfect success clutch lamps \" incircuit with coils of such large self-induction that any but very slightfluctuations were wiped out.\" Surely Prof. Thomson does not mean to say thatself-induction wiped out the periodical fluctuations of the current. For this,just the opposite quality, namely, capacity, is required. The self-induction ofthe coils in this case simply augmented the impedence and prevented the greatvariations occurring at large time intervals, which take place when theresistance in circuit with the lamps is too small, or even with largerresistance in circuit when the dash pots either in the lamps or elsewhere aretoo loose. Prof. Thomson further states that in a lamp in which the feed mechanism isunder the control of the derived circuit magnet only, the fluctuations passthrough the arc without affecting the magnet to a perceptible degree. It is truethat the variations of the resistance of the arc, in consequence of thevariations in the current strength, are such as to dampen the fluctuation.Nevertheless, the periodical fluctuations are transmitted through the derivedcircuit, as one may convince himself easily of, by holding a thin plate of ironagainst the magnet. In regard to the physiological effects of the currents I may state that uponreading the memorable lecture of Sir William Thomson, in which he advanced hisviews on the propagation of the alternate currents through conductors, itinstantly occurred to me that currents of high frequencies would be lessinjurious. I have been looking for a proof that the mode of distribution throughthe body is the cause of the smaller physiological effects. At times I havethought to have been able to locate the pain in the outer portions of the body,but it is very uncertain. It is most certain, however, that the feeling withcurrents of very high frequencies is somewhat different from that with lowfrequencies. I have also noted the enormous importance of one being prepared forthe shock or not. If one is prepared, the effect upon the nerves is not nearlyas great as when unprepared. With alternations as high as 10,000 per second andupwards, one feels but little pain in the central portion of the body. Aremarkable feature of such currents of high tension is that one receives a burninstantly he touches the wire, but beyond that the pain is hardly noticeable. But since the potential difference across the body by a given current throughit is very small, the effects can not be very well ascribed to the surfacedistribution of the current, and the excessively low resistance of the body tosuch rapidly varying currents speak rather for a condenser action. In regard to the suggestion of Dr. Tatum, which Prof. Thomson mentions inanother article in the same issue, I would state that I have constructedmachines up to 480 poles, from which it is possible to obtain about 30,000alternations per second, and perhaps more. I have also designed types ofmachines in which the field would revolve in an opposite direction to thearmature, by which means it would be possible to obtain from a similar machine60,000 alternations per second or more. I highly value the appreciation of Prof. Thomson of my work, but I mustconfess that in his conclusion he makes a most astounding statement as to themotives of his critical remarks. I have never for a moment thought that hisremarks would be dictated by anything but friendly motives. Often we are forcedin daily life to represent opposing interests or opinions, but surely in thehigher aims the feelings of friendship and mutual consideration should not beaffected by such things as these. N. Tesla Alternate Current Motors The Electrical Engineer - April 3, 1891 Sir — In your issue of March 6 I find the passage: \"Mr. Kapp described theposition as it exists. He showed how Ferraris first of all pointed out the rightway to get an alternating-current motor that was self-starting, and how Teslaand others had worked in the direction indicated by Ferraris,\" etc. I would be very glad to learn how Mr. Kapp succeeded in showing this. I may callhis attention to the fact that the date of filing of my American patentanticipates the publication of the results of Prof. Ferraris in Italy bysomething like six months. The date of filing of my application is, therefore,the first public record of the invention. Considering this fact, it seems to methat it would be desireable that Mr. Kapp should modify his statement. —Yours,etc. Nikola Tesla New York, 17th March , 1891 Electro-Motors Electrical Review - London — April 3, 1891 Fifteen or sixteen years ago, when I was pursuing my course at the college, Iwas told by an eminent physicist that a motor could not he operated without theuse of brushes and commutators, or mechanical means of some kind for commutatingthe current. It was then I determined to solve the problem. After years of persistent thought I finally arrived at a solution. I workedout the theory to the last detail, and confirmed all of my theoreticalconclusions by experiments. Recognizing the value of the invention, I appliedmyself to the work of perfecting it, and after long continued labor I producedseveral types of practical motors. Now all this I did long before anything whatever transpired in the wholescientific literature — as far as it could be ascertained — which would haveeven pointed at the possibility of obtaining such a result, but quite contraryat a time when scientific and practical men alike considered this resultunattainable. In all civilized countries patents have been obtained almostwithout a single reference to anything which would have in the least degreerendered questionable the novelty of the invention. The first published essay —an account of some laboratory experiments by Prof. Ferraris — was published inItaly six or seven months after the date of filing of my applications for thefoundation patents. The date of filing of my patents is thus the first publicrecord of the invention. Yet in your issue of March 6th I read the passage: \"For several years past, from the days of Prof. Ferraris’s investigations, whichwere followed by those of Tesla, Zipernowsky and a host of imitators,\" etc. No one can say that I have not been free in acknowledging the merit of Prof.Ferraris, and I hope that my statement of facts will not be misinterpreted. Evenif Prof. Ferraris’s essay would have anticipated the date of filing of myapplication, yet, in the opinion of all fairminded men, I would have beenentitled to the credit of having been the first to produce a practical motor ;for Prof. Ferraris himself denies in his essay the value of the invention forthe transmission of power, and only points out the possibility of using aproperly-constructed generator, which is the only way of obtaining the requireddifference of phase without losses; for even with condensers — by means of whichit is possible to obtain a quarter phase — there are considerable losses, thecost of the condensers not considered. Thus, in the most essential features of the system — the generators with thetwo or three circuits of differing phase, the three-wire system, the closed coilarmature, the motors with direct current in the field, etc. — I would standalone, even had Prof. Ferraris’s essay been published many years ago. As regards the most practicable form of two-wire motor, namely, one with asingle energising circuit and induced circuits, of which there are now thousandsin use, I likewise stand alone. Most of these facts, if not all, are perfectly well known in England; yet,according to some papers, one of the leading English electricians does nothesitate to say that I have worked in the direction indicated by Prof. Ferraris,and in your issue above referred to it seems I am called an imitator. Now, I ask you where is that world-known English fairness ? I am a pioneer,and I am called an imitator. I am not an imitator. I produce original work ornone at all. Nikola Tesla Phenomena of Currents of High Frequency The Electrical Engineer - N. Y. — April. 8, 1891 I cannot pass without comment the note of Prof. Thomson in your issue ofApril 1, although I dislike very much to engage in a prolonged controversy. Iwould gladly let Prof. Thomson have the last word, were it not that some of hisstatements render a reply from me necessary. I did not mean to imply that, whatever work Prof. Thomson has done inalternating currents of very high frequency, he had done subsequent to hisletter published in the Electrician. I thought it possible, and even probable,that he had made his experiments some time before, and my statement in regard tothis was meant in this general way. It is more than probable that quite a numberof experimenters have built such machines and observed effects similar to thosedescribed by Prof. Thomson. It is doubtful, however, whether, in the absence ofany publication on this subject, the luminous phenomena described by me havebeen observed by others, the more so, as very few would be likely to go to thetrouble I did, and I would myself not have done so had I not had beforehand thefirm conviction, gained from the study of the works of the most advancedthinkers, that I would obtain the results sought for. Now, that I have indicatedthe direction, many will probably follow, and for this very purpose I have shownsome of the results I have reached. Prof. Thomson states decisively in regard to experiments with theincandescent lamp bulb and the filament mounted on a single wire, that he cannotagree with me at all that conduction through the glass has anything to do withthe phenomenon observed. He mentions the well-known fact that an incandescentlamp acts as a Leyden jar and says that \" if conduction through the glass were apossibility this action could not occur.\" I think I may confidently assert thatvery few electricians will share this view. For the possibility of the condensereffect taking place it is only necessary that the rate at which the charges canequalize through the glass by conduction should be somewhat below the rate atwhich they are stored. Prof. Thomson seems to think that conduction through the glass is animpossibility. Has he then never measured insulation resistance, and has he thennot measured it by means of a conduction current? Does he think that there issuch a thing as a perfect non-conductor among the bodies we are able to perceive? Does he not think that as regards conductivity there can be question only ofdegree? If glass were a perfect non-conductor, how could we account for theleakage of a glass condenser when subjected to steady differences of potential? While not directly connected with the present controversy, I would here pointout that there exists a popular error in regard to the properties of dielectricbodies. Many electricians frequently confound the theoretical dielectric ofMaxwell with the dielectric bodies in use. They do not stop to think that theonly perfect dielectric is ether, and that all other bodies, the existence ofwhich is known to us, must be conductors, judging from their physicalproperties. My statement that conduction is concerned to some, although perhapsnegligible, extent in the experiment above described was, however, made not onlyon account of the fact that all bodies conduct more or less, but principally onaccount of the heating of the glass during the experiment. Prof. Thomson seemsto overlook the fact that the insulating power of glass diminishes enormouslywith the increase in temperature, so much so, that melted glass is comparativelyan excellent conductor. I have, moreover, stated in my first reply to Prof.Thomson in your issue of March 18, that the same experiment can be performed bymeans of an unvarying difference of potential. In this case it must be assumedthat some such process as conduction through the glass takes place, and all themore as it is possible to show by experiment, that with a sufficiently highsteady difference of potential, enough current can be passed through the glassof a condenser with mercury coating to light up a Geissler tube joined in serieswith the condenser. When the potential is alternating, the condenser actioncomes in and conduction becomes insignificant, and the more so, the greater therate of alternation or change per unit of time. Nevertheless, in my opinion,conduction must always exist, especially if the glass is hot, though it may benegligible with very high frequencies. Prof. Thomson states, further, that from his point of view I havemisunderstood his statement about the limit of audition. He says that 10,000 to20,000 alternations correspond to 5,000 to 10,000 complete waves of sound. In myfirst reply to Prof. Thomson’s remarks (in your issue of March 18,) I avoidedpointing out directly that Prof. Thomson was mistaken, but now I see no way outof it. Prof. Thomson will pardon me if I call his attention to the fact he seemsto disregard, namely, that 10,000 to 20,000 alternations of current in an arc —which was the subject under discussion — do not mean 5,000 to 10,000, but 10,000to 20,000 complete waves of sound. He says that I have adopted or suggested as the limit of audition10,000 wavesper second, but I have neither adopted nor suggested it. Prof. Thomson statesthat I have been working with 5,000 to 10,000 complete waves, while I havenowhere made any such statement. He says that this would be working below thelimit of audition, and cites as an argument that at the Central High School, inPhiladelphia, he has heard 20,000 waves per second ; but he wholly overlooks apoint on which I have dwelt at some length, namely, that the limit of auditionof an arc is something entirely different from the limit of audition in general. Prof. Thomson further states, in reply to some of my views expressed inregard to the constant current machines that five or six years ago it occurredto him to try the construction of a dynamo for constant current, in which \" thearmature coils were of a highly efficient type, that is, of comparatively shortwire length for the voltage and moving in a dense magnetic field.\" Exteriorly tothe coils and to the field he had placed in the circuit of each coil animpedance coil which consisted of an iron core wound with a considerable lengthof wire and connected directly in circuit with the armature coil. He thusobtained, he thought, \" the property of considerable self-induction along withefficient current generation.\" Prof. Thomson says he expected \" that possiblythe effects would be very much the same as those obtainable from the regularlyconstructed apparatus.\" But he was disappointed, he adds. With all theconsideration due to Prof. Thomson, I would say that, to expect a good resultfrom such a combination, was rather sanguine. Earth is not farther from Heaventhan this arrangement is from one, in which there would be a length of wire,sufficient to give the same self-induction, wound on the armature and utilizedto produce useful E. M. F., instead of doing just the opposite, let alone theloss in the iron cores. But it is, of course, only fair to remember that thisexperiment was performed five or six years ago, when even the foremostelectricians lacked the necessary information in these and other matters. Prof. Thomson seems to think that self-induction wipes out the periodicalundulations of current. Now self-induction does not produce any such effect,but, if anything, it renders the undulation more pronounced. This isself-evident. Let us insert a self-induction coil in a circuit traversed by anundulating current and see what happens. During the period of the greatest rateof change, when the current has a small value, the self-induction opposes morethan during the time of the small rate of change when the current is at, ornear, its maximum value. The consequence is, that with the same frequency themaximum value of the current becomes the greater, the greater theself-induction. As the sound in a telephone depends only on the maximum value,it is clear that self-induction is the very thing required in a telephonecircuit. The larger the self-induction, the louder and clearer the speech,provided the same current is passed through the circuit. I have had ampleopportunity to study this subject during my telephone experience of severalyears. As regard the fact that a self-induction coil in series with a telephonediminishes the loudness of the sound, Prof. Thomson seems to overlook the factthat this effect is wholly due to the impedance of the coil, i. e., to itsproperty of diminishing the current strength. But while the current strength isdiminished the undulation is rendered only more pronounced. Obviously, whencomparisons are made they must be made with the same current. In an arc machine, such as that of Prof. Thomson’s, the effect is different.There, one has to deal with a make and break. There are then two inducedcurrents, one in the opposite, the other in the same direction with the maincurrent. If the function of the mechanism be the same whether a self-inductioncoil be present or not, the undulations could not possibly be wiped out. ButProf. Thomson seems, likewise, to forget that the effect is wholly due to thedefect of the commutator ; namely, the induced current of the break, which is ofthe same direction with the main current and of great intensity, when largeself-induction is present, simply bridges the adjacent commutator segments, or,if not entirely so, at least shortens the interval during which the circuit isopen and thus reduces the undulation. In regard to the improvement in the feeding of the lamps by vibrations orundulations, Prof. Thomson expresses a decisive opinion. He now says that thevibrations must improve the feeding of a clock-work lamp. He says that I\"contented myself by simply saying,\" that I cannot agree with him on that point. Now, saying it, is not the only thing I did. I have passed many a nightwatching a lamp feed, and I leave it to any skilled experimenter to investigatewhether my statements are correct. My opinion is, that a clock-work lamp; thatis, a lamp in which the descent of the carbon is regulated not by a clutch orfriction mechanism, but by an escapement, cannot feed any more perfectly thantooth by tooth, which may be a movement of, say, 1/15 of an inch or less. Such alamp will feed in nearly the same manner whether the current be perfectly smoothor undulating, providing the conditions of the circuit are otherwise stable. Ifthere is any advantage, I think it would be in the use of a smooth current, for,with an undulating current, the lamp is likely to miss some time and feed bymore than one tooth. But in a lamp in which the descent of the carbon isregulated by friction mechanism, an indulating current of the proper number ofundulations per second will always give a better result. Of course, to realizefully the benefits of the undulating current the release ought to be effectedindependently of the up-and-down movement I have pointed out before. In regard to the physiological effects, Prof. Thomson says, that in such acomparatively poor conductive material as animal tissue the distribution ofcurrent cannot be governed by self-induction to any appreciable extent, but hedoes not consider the two-fold effect of the large cross-section, pointed out bySir William Thomson. As the resistance of the body to such currents is low, wemust assume either condenser action or induction of currents in the body. Nikola Tesla New York, April 4, 1891 Electric Discharge in Vacuum Tubes The Electrical Engineer - N.Y. — July 1, 1891 In The Electrical Engineer of June 10 I have noted the description of someexperiments of Prof. J. J. Thomson, on the \"Electric Discharge in Vacuum Tubes,\"and in your issue of June 24 Prof. Elihu Thomson describes an experiment of thesame kind. The fundamental idea in these experiments is to set up anelectromotive force in a vacuum tube — preferably devoid of any electrodes — bymeans of electromagnetic induction, and to excite the tube in this manner. As I view the subject I should think that to any experimenter who hadcarefully studied the problem confronting us and who attempted to find asolution of it, this idea must present itself as naturally as, for instance, theidea of replacing the tinfoil coatings of a Leyden jar by rarefied gas andexciting luminosity in the condenser thus obtained by repeatedly charging anddischarging it. The idea being obvious, whatever merit there is in this line ofinvestigation must depend upon the completeness of the study of the subject andthe correctness of the observations. The following lines are not penned with anydesire on my part to put myself on record as one who has performed `similarexperiments, but with a desire to assist other experimenters by pointing outcertain peculiarities of the phenomena observed, which, to all appearances, havenot been noted by Prof. J. J. Thomson, who, however, seems to have gone aboutsystematically in his investigations, and who has been the first to make hisresults known. These peculiarities noted by me would seem to be at variance withthe views of Prof. J. J. Thomson, and present the phenomena in a differentlight. My investigations in this line occupied me principally during the winter andspring of the past year. During this time many different experiments wereperformed, and in my exchanges of ideas on this subject with Mr. Alfred S.Brown, of the Western Union Telegraph Company, various different dispositionswere suggested which were carried out by me in practice. Fig. 1 may serve as anexample of one of the many forms of apparatus used. This consisted of a largeglass tube sealed at one end and projecting into an ordinary incandescent lampbulb. The primary, usually consisting of a few turns of thick, well-insulatedcopper sheet was inserted within the tube, the inside space of the bulbfurnishing the secondary. This form of apparatus was arrived at after someexperimenting, and was used principally with the view of enabling me to place apolished reflecting surface on the inside of the tube, and for this purpose thelast turn of the primary was covered with a thin silver sheet. In all forms ofapparatus used there was no special difficulty in exciting a luminous circle orcylinder in proximity to the primary. , > As to the number of turns, I cannot quite understand why Prof. J. J. Thomsonshould think that a few turns were \"quite sufficient,\" but lest I should imputeto him an opinion he may not have, I will add that I have gained this impressionfrom the reading of the published abstracts of his lecture. Clearly, the numberof turns which gives the best result in any case, is dependent on the dimensionsof the apparatus, and, were it not for various considerations, one turn wouldalways give the best result. I have found that it is preferable to use. in these experiments an, alternatecurrent machine giving a moderate number of alternations per second to excitethe induction coil for charging the Leyden jar which discharges through theprimary — shown diagrammatically in Fig. 2, — as in such case, before thedisruptive discharge takes place, the tube or bulb is slightly excited and theformation of the luminous circle is decidedly facilitated. But I have also useda Wimshurst machine in some experiments. > Prof. J. J. Thomson’s view of the phenomena under consideration seems to bethat they are wholly due to electro-magnetic action. I was, at one time, of thesame opinion, but upon carefully investigating the subject I was led to theconviction that they are more of an electrostatic nature. It must be rememberedthat in these experiments we have to deal with primary currents of an enormousfrequency or rate of change and of high potential, and that the secondaryconductor consists of a rarefied gas, and that under such conditionselectrostatic effects must play an important part. > In support of my view I will describe a few experiments made by me. To exciteluminosity in the tube it is not absolutely necessary that the conductor shouldbe closed. For instance, if an ordinary exhausted tube (preferably of largediameter) be surrounded by a spiral of thick copper wire serving as the primary,a feebly luminous spiral may be induced in the tube, roughly shown in Fig. 3. Inone of these experiments a curious phenomenon was observed; namely, twointensely luminous circles, each of them close to a turn of the primary spiral,were formed inside of the tube, and I attributed this phenomenon to the.existence of nodes on the primary. The circles were connected by a faintluminous spiral parallel to the primary and in close proximity to it. To producethis effect I have found it necessary to strain the jar to the utmost. The turnsof the spiral tend to close and form circles, but this, of course, would beexpected, and does not necessarily indicate an electro-magnetic effect; whereasthe fact that a glow can be produced along the primary in the form of an openspiral argues for an electrostatic effect. > In using Dr. Lodge’s recoil circuit, the electrostatic action is likewiseapparent. The arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 4. In his experiments twohollow exhausted tubes H H were slipped over the wires of the recoil circuit andupon discharging the jar in the usual manner luminosity was excited in thetubes. Another experiment performed is illustrated in Fig. 5. In this case anordinary lamp-bulb was surrounded by one or two turns of thick copper wire P andthe luminous circle L excited in the bulb by discharging the jar through theprimary. The lamp-bulb was provided with a tinfoil coating on the side oppositeto the primary and each time the tinfoil coating was connected to the ground orto a large object the luminosity of the circle was considerably increased. Thiswas evidently due to electrostatic action. In other experiments I have noted that when the primary touches the glass theluminous circle is easier produced and is more sharply defined; but I have notnoted that, generally speaking, the circles induced were very sharply defined,as Prof. J. J. Thomson has observed; on the contrary, in my experiments theywere broad and often the whole of the bulb or tube was illuminated; and in oneease I have observed an intensely purplish glow, to which Prof. J. J. Thomsonrefers. But the circles were always in close proximity to the primary and wereconsiderably easier produced when the latter was very close to the glass, muchmore so than would be expected assuming the action to be electromagnetic andconsidering the distance; and these facts speak for an electrostatic effect. > Furthermore I have observed that there is a molecular bombardment in theplane of the luminous circle at right angles to the glass — supposing the circleto be in the plane of the primary — this bombardment being evident from therapid heating of the glass near the primary. Were the bombardment not at rightangles to the glass the hating could not be so rapid. If there is acircumferential movement of the molecules constituting the luminous circle, Ihave thought that it might be rendered manifest by placing within the tube orbulb, radially to the circle, a thin plate of mica coated with somephosphorescent material and another such plate tangentially to the circle. Ifthe molecules would move circumferentially, the former plate would be renderedmore intensely phosphorescent. For want of time I have, however, not been ableto perform the experiment. > Another observation made by me was that when the specific inductive capacityof the medium between the primary and secondary is increased, the inductiveeffect is augmented. This is roughly illustrated in Fig. G. In this caseluminosity was excited in an exhausted tube or bulb B and a glass tube T slippedbetween the primary and the bulb, when the effect pointed out was noted. Werethe action wholly electromagnetic no change could possibly have been observed. I have likewise noted that when a bulb is surrounded by a wire closed uponitself and in the plane of the primary, the formation of the luminous circlewithin the bulb is not prevented. But if instead of the wire a broad strip oftinfoil is glued upon the bulb, the formation of the luminous band wasprevented, because then the action was. ‘distributed over a greater surface. Theeffect of the closed tinfoil was no doubt of an electrostatic nature, for itpresented a much greater resistance than the closed wire and produced thereforea much smaller electromagnetic effect. Some of the experiments of Prof. J. J. Thomson also would seem to show someelectrostatic action. For instance, in the experiment with the bulb enclosed ina bell jar, I should think that when the latter is exhausted so far that the gasenclosed reaches the maximum conductivity, the formation of the circle in thebulb and jar is prevented because of the space surrounding the primary beinghighly conducting; when the jar is further exhausted, the conductivity of thespace around the primary diminishes and the circles appear necessarily first inthe bell jar, as the rarefied gas is nearer to the primary. But were theinductive effect very powerful, they would probably appear in the bulb also. If,however, the bell Jar were exhausted to the highest degree they would verylikely show themselves in the bulb only, that is, supposing the vacuous space tobe non-conducting. On the assumption that in these phenomena electrostaticactions are concerned we find it easily explicable why the introduction ofmercury or the heating of the bulb prevents the formation of the luminous bandor shortens the after-glow; and also why in some cases a platinum wire mayprevent the excitation of the tube. Nevertheless some of the experiments ofProf. J. J. Thomson would seem to indicate an electromagnetic effect. I may addthat in one of my experiments in which a vacuum was produced by the Torricellianmethod, I was unable to produce the luminous band, but this may have been due tothe weak exciting current employed. My principal argument is the following: I have experimentally proved that ifthe same discharge which is barely sufficient to excite a luminous band in thebulb when passed through the primary circuit be so directed as to exalt theelectrostatic inductive effect — namely, by converting upwards — an exhaustedtube, devoid of electrodes, may be excited at a distance of several feet. Nikola Tesla Note by Prof. J. J. Thomson The London Electrician, July 24, 1891 \"Mr. Tesla seems to ascribe the effects he observed to electrostatic action,and I have no doubt, from the description he gives of his method of conductinghis experiments, that in them electrostatic action plays a very important part.He .seems, however, to have misunderstood my position with respect to the causeof these discharges, which is not, as he implies, that luminosity in tubeswithout electrodes cannot be produced by electrostatic action, but that it canalso be produced when this action is excluded. As a matter of fact, it is verymuch easier to get the luminosity when these electrostatic effects are operativethan when they are not. As an illustration of this I may mention that the firstexperiment I tried with the discharge of a Leyden jar produced luminosity in thetube, but it was not until after six weeks’ continuous experimenting that I wasable to get a discharge in the exhausted tube which I was satisfied was due towhat is ordinarily called electrodynamic action. It is advisable to have a clearidea of what we mean by electrostatic action. If, previous to the discharge ofthe jar, the primary coil is raised to a high potential, it will induce over theglass of the tube a distribution of electricity. When the potential of theprimary suddenly falls, this electrification will redistribute itself, and maypass through, the rarefied gas and produce luminosity in doing so. Whilst thedischarge of the jar is going on, it is difficult, and, from a theoretical pointof view, undesirable, to separate the effect into parts, one of which is calledelectrostatic, the other electromagnetic; what we can prove is that in this casethe discharge is not such as would be produced by electromotive forces derivedfrom a potential function. In my experiments the primary coil was connected toearth, and, as a further precaution, the primary was separated from thedischarge tube by a screen of blotting paper, moistened with dilute sulphuricacid, and connected to earth. Wet blotting paper is a sufficiently goodconductor to screen off a stationary electrostatic effect, though it is not agood enough one to stop waves of alternating electromotive intensity. Whenshowing the experiments to the Physical Society I could not, of course, keep thetubes covered up, but, unless my memory deceives me, I stated the precautionswhich had been taken against the electrostatic effect. To correctmisapprehension I may state that I did not read a formal paper to the Society,my object being to exhibit a few of the most typical experiments. The account ofthe experiments in the Electrician was from a reporter’s note, and was notwritten, or even read, by me. I have now almost finished writing out, and hopevery shortly to publish, an account of these and a large number of alliedexperiments, including some analogous to those mentioned by Mr. Tesla on theeffect of conductors placed near the discharge tube, which I find, in somecases, to produce a diminution, in others an increase, in the brightness of thedischarge, as well as some on the effect of the presence of substances of largespecific inductive capacity. These seem to me to admit of a satisfactoryexplanation, for which, however, I must refer to my paper.\" N. Tesla Reply to J. J. Thomson’s The Electrical Engineer - N.Y. — August 26, 1891 In The Electrical Engineer of August 12, I find some remarks of Prof. J. J.Thomson, which appeared originally in the London Electrician and which have abearing upon some experiments described by me in your issue of July 1. I did not, as Prof. J. J. Thomson seems to believe, misunderstand hisposition in regard to the cause of the phenomena considered, but I thought thatin his experiments, as well as in my own, electrostatic effects were of greatimportance. It did not appear, from the meagre description of his experiments,that all possible precautions had been taken to exclude these effects. I did notdoubt that luminosity could be excited in a closed tube when electrostaticaction is completely excluded. In fact, at the outset, I myself looked for apurely electrodynamic effect and believed that I had obtained it. But manyexperiments performed at that time proved to me that the electrostatic effectswere generally of far greater importance, and admitted of a more satisfactoryexplanation of most of the phenomena observed. In using the term electrostatic I had reference rather to the nature of theaction than to a stationary condition, which is the usual acceptance of theterm. To express myself more clearly, I will suppose that near a closedexhausted tube be placed a small sphere charged to a very high potential. Thesphere would act inductively upon the tube, and by distributing electricity overthe same would undoubtedly produce luminosity (if the potential be sufficientlyhigh), until a permanent condition would be reached. Assuming the tube to beperfectly well insulated, there would be only one instantaneous flash during theact of distribution. This would be due to the electrostatic action simply. But now, suppose the charged sphere to be moved at short intervals with greatspeed along the exhausted tube. The tube would now be permanently excited, asthe moving sphere would cause a constant redistribution of electricity andcollisions of the molecules of the rarefied gas. We would still have to dealwith an electrostatic effect, and in addition an electrodynamic effect would beobserved. But if it were found that, for instance, the effect produced dependedmore on the specific inductive capacity than on the magnetic permeability of themedium — which would certainly be the case for speeds incomparably lower thanthat of light — then I believe I would be justified in saying that the effectproduced was more of an electrostatic nature. I do not mean to say, however,that any similar condition prevails in the case of the discharge of a Leyden jarthrough the primary, but I think that such an action would be desirable. It is in the spirit of the above example that I used the terms \"more of anelectrostatic nature,\" and have investigated the influence of bodies of highspecific inductive capacity, and observed, for instance, the importance of thequality of glass of which the tube is made. I also endeavored to ascertain theinfluence of a medium of high permeability by using oxygen. It appeared fromrough estimation that an oxygen tube when excited under similar conditions —that is, as far as could be determined — gives more light; but this, of course,may be due to many causes. Without doubting in the least that, with the care and precautions taken byProf. J. J. Thomson, the luminosity excited was due solely to electrodynamicaction, I would say that in many experiments I have observed curious instancesof the ineffectiveness of the screening, and I have also found that theelectrification through the air is often of very great importance, and may, insome cases, determine the excitation of the tube. In his original communication to the Electrician, Prof. J. J. Thomson refersto the fact that the luminosity in a tube near a wire through which a Leyden jarwas discharged was noted by Hittorf. I think that the feeble luminous effectreferred to has been noted by many experimenters, but in my experiments theeffects were much more powerful than those usually noted. Nikola Tesla The \"Drehstrom\" Patent The Electrical World - N. Y. — Oct. 8, 1892 In the last issue of the Electrical World I find an article on my \"Drehstrom\"patent which appeared originally is Industries, and is, I believe, from the penof the able editor of that journal. Some of the statements made are such as tocause an erroneous opinion to gain ground, which I deem it my duty to prevent —a disagreeable one I may say, as I do not like to express my opinion on apatent, especially if it is my own. It may be, as the writer states, that the theory of the action of my motoradvanced in my paper before the American Institute in May, 1888, is a clumsyone, but this theory was formed by me a number of years before the practicalresults were announced, the patents being applied for only after it wasundoubtedly demonstrated that the motor could fairly compete in efficiency withthe direct current motor, and that the invention was one of commercial value.These patents were taken out with the help of some of the ablest attorneys inthe United States, well versed in electrical matters; the specifications weredrawn up with great care, in view of the importance of the invention, and withproper regard to the state of the art at that period, and had the patents beencarefully studied by others there would not hare been various features of mysystem reinvented, and several inventors, would have been spared at this latedate a keen disappointment. The writer apprehends that it might be difficult for a non-technical judge todecide whether a motor with two or more separate fields and armatures, coupledtogether mechanically, does or does not fall under my patent. I do not share hisapprehension, Judges are highly educated men, and it does not require muchtechnical knowledge to convince one that it is the same whether two beltsdriving a rigid arbor are close together or far apart. Nor do I think that it isnecessary for the honorable judge to be a partisan of the armature reactiontheory in order to recognize the identity of the two arrangements referred to bythe writer of the article in question. Indeed, I would seriously doubt thesincerity of a man capable of clear conceptions were he to uphold that thearrangements are essentially different, even if the case should stand exactly ashe assumes by way of illustration of \" puzzles likely to arise.\" For where isthere a difference? Take, for instance, a form of my two-phase motor. There aretwo sets of field magnets, one at the neutral parts of the other. One of thesets, therefore, might as well be removed and placed a distance sideways, butlong experience shows that in output, efficiency, cost of construction and ingeneral mechanical respects such an arrangement is inferior. The two sets areconnected inductively through the armature body or the windings thereon. Part ofthe period one set of field magnets acts as a generator, setting up inductioncurrents, which circulate in the field of force of the other set, which may belooked upon as a motor. Part of the period again, the second set becomes thegenerator and the first the motor, the action being at the same time such thatthe generated currents are always passed in a definite direction with respect tothe field ; they are commutated as it were, and a tendency to rotate in a givendirection is imparted to the armature. Now place two fields side by side andconnect properly the armature windings. Are not the fields again inductivelyconnected? Do not the currents set up by one field cause currents to circulatein the other, and is the action not exactly the same in both cases? This is afact, no matter what theory is adhered to. The writer says that in the case oftwo separate structures there is really nothing which may be called rotation ofthe field. But is there any such thing, when the two structures are merged inone? Is it not in accordance with accepted notions to conceive the imaginarylines as surging simply in the pole projections in exactly the same manner inboth the arrangements? Irrespective of the view taken, be it even the moreunfair to the inventor, no one is permitted to go so far as to make himresponsible, in such a case, for theories and interpretations of his invention.Theories may come and go, but the motor works, a practical result is achievedand the art is advanced through his pains and efforts. But what I desire topoint out principally is that in the article above referred to the writer isonly assuming a case which cannot occur. He is evidently judging the state ofthings from my short paper before the American Institute. This paper was writtenin a hurry, in fact only shortly before the meeting of the Institute, and I wasunable to do full justice even to those features upon which as employee of acompany owning the invention, I was permitted to dwell. Allow me to observe thatmy patent specification was written up more carefully than my paper and the viewtaken in it is a broader and truer one. While the \"clumsy\" theory was adapted asthe beat in explanation of the action of the motor, the invention is notrepresented as dependent entirely on that theory ; and in showing a three phasemotor with six projections, where it was manifestly more consistent with theaccepted popular ideas to assume the \"lines of force\" as simply surging in theprojecting pole pieces, this view was distinctly and advisedly taken, as thefollowing quotation from my foundation patent will show : \"The variations in thestrength and intensity of the currents transmitted through these circuits (linesand armature) and traversing the coils of the motor produce a steadilyprogressive shifting of the resultant attractive force exerted by the poles uponthe armature and consequently keep the armature rapidly rotating.\" There is, inthis instance, no question of a rotating field in the common acceptance of theterm of the resultant attractive force there is a question simply of a diagramof force, and it is immaterial for the operation whether the fields are closetogether or far apart, or even whether, or not, they are inductively connected. I do not think that in Germany, where the Patent Office is proverbiallystrict in upholding the rights of the inventor, an illegitimate and unfairappropriation of the invention by others will be tolerated by the courts. N. Tesla The Ewing High-Frequency Alternator and Parsons Steam Engine Electrician - London — Dec. 17, 1892 In your issue of November 18 I find a description of Prof. Ewing’shigh-frequency alternator, which has pleased me chiefly because it conveyed tome the knowledge that he, and with him, no doubt, other scientific men, is toinvestigate the properties of high-frequency currents. With apparatus such asyou describe, shortly a number of experimenters, more competent than myself,will be enabled to go over the ground as yet but imperfectly explored, whichwill undoubtedly result in the observation of novel facts and elimination ofeventual errors. I hope it will not be interpreted as my wishing to detract anything fromProf. Ewing’s merit if I state the fact that for a considerable time past I havelikewise thought of combining the identical steam turbine with a high-frequencyalternator. Anch’ io sono pittore. I had a number of designs with such turbines,and would have certainly carried them out had the turbines been here easily andcheaply obtainable, and had my attention not been drawn in a differentdirection. As to the combination to which you give a rather complicated name, Iconsider it an excellent one. The advantages of using a high speed areespecially great in connection with such alternators. When a belt is used todrive, one must resort to extraordinarily large diameters in order to obtain thenecessary speed, and this increases the difficulties and cost of construction inan entirely unreasonable proportion. In the machine used in my recentexperiments the weight of the active parts is less than 50 pounds, but there isan additional weight of over 100 pounds in the supporting frame, which a verycareful constructor would have probably made much heavier. When running at itsmaximum speed, and with a proper capacity in the armature circuit, two and aone-half horse-power can be performed. The large diameter (30 inches), ofcourse, has the advantage of affording better facility for radiation; but, onthe other hand, it is impossible to work with a very small clearance. I have observed with interest that Prof. Ewing has used a magnet withalternating poles. In my first trials I expected to obtain the best results witha machine of the Mordey type - that is, with one having pole projections of thesame polarity. My idea was to energize the field up to the point of the maximumpermeability of the iron and vary the induction around that point. But I foundthat with a very great number of pole projections such a machine would not givegood results, although with few projections, and with an armature without iron,as used by Mordey, the results obtained were excellent. Many experiences ofsimilar nature made in the course of my study demonstrate that the ordinaryrules for the magnetic circuit do not hold good with high frequency currents. Inponderable matter magnetic permeability, and also specific inductive capacity,must undergo considerable change when the frequency is varied within widelimits. This would render very difficult the exact determination of the energydissipated in iron cores by very rapid cycles of magnetization, and of that inconductors and condensers, by very quick reversals of current. Much valuablework remains to be done in these fields, in which it is so easy to observe novelphenomena, but so difficult to make quantitative determinations. The results ofProf. Ewing’s systematical research will be awaited with great interest. It is gratifying to note from his tests that the turbines are being rapidlyimproved. Though I am aware that the majority of engineers do not favor theiradoption. I do not hesitate to say that I believe in their success. I thinktheir principle uses, in no distant future, will be in connection with alternatecurrent motors, by means of which it is easy to obtain a constant and, in anydesired ratio, reduced speed. There are objections to their employment fordriving direct current generators, as the commutators must be a source of someloss and trouble, on account of the very great speed; but with an alternatorthere is no objectionable feature whatever. No matter how much one may beopposed to the introduction of the turbine, he must have watched with surprisethe development of this curious branch of the industry, in which Mr. Parsons-hasbeen a pioneer, and everyone must wish him the success which his skill hasdeserved. Nikola Tesla The Physiological and Other Effects of High Frequency Currents The Electrical Engineer — Feb. 11, 1893 In the Electrical Engineer, of January 25,1893, I note an article by Mr. A.A. C. Swinton, referring to my experiments with high frequency currents. Mr:Swinton uses in these experiments the method of converting described by me in mypaper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, in May, 1891, andpublished in the Electrical Engineer of July 8, 1891, which has since beenemployed by a number of experimenters; but it has somewhat surprised me toobserve that he makes use of an ordinary vibrating contact-breaker, whereas hecould have employed the much simpler method of converting continuous currentsinto alternating currents of any frequency which was shown by me two years ago.This method does not involve the employment of any moving parts, and allows theexperimenter to vary the frequency et will by simple adjustments. I had thoughtthat most electricians were at present familiar with this mode of conversionwhich possesses many beautiful features. The effects observed by Mr. Swinton are not new to rue and they might havebeen anticipated by those who have carefully read what I !rave written on thesubject. But I cannot agree with some of the views expressed by him. First of all, in regard to the physiological effects. I have made a clearstatement at the beginning of my published studies, and my continued experience:with these currents has only further strengthened me is the opinion thenexpressed. I stated in my paper, before mentioned, that it is an undeniable factthat currents of very high frequency are less injurious than the low frequencycurrents, :but I have also taken care to prevent the idea from gaining groundthat these currents are absolutely harmless, as will be evident, from thefollowing quotation: \" If received directly from a machine or from a secondaryof low resistance, they (high frequency currents) produce more or less powerfuleffects, and may, cause serious injury, especially when used in conjunction withcondensed.\" This refers to currents of ordinary’ potential differences such asare used in general commercial practice. As regards the currents of very high potential differences, which wereemployed an my, experiments, I have never considered the current’s strength, butthe energy which the human body eras capable of receiving without injury, and Ihave expressed this quite clearly on more than one occasion. For instance, Istated teat \"the higher, the frequency the greater the amount of electricalenergy which may be passed through the body without serious discomfort.\" And onanother occasion when a high tension coil was short-circuited though the body ofthe experimenter I stated that the immunity was due to the fact that less energywas available externally to the coil when the experimenter’s body joined theterminals. This is practically what Mr. Swinton expresses in another way;namely, by saying that with \"high frequency currents it is possible to obtaineffects with exceedingly small currents,\" etc. In regard to the experiments, with lamp filaments, I have, I believe,expressed myself with equal clearness. I have pointed out come phenomena ofimpedance which at that time (1891) were considered very striating, and I havealso pointed out the great importance of the rarefied gas surrounding thefilament when we have to deal with currents of such high frequency. The heatingof the filament by s comparatively small current is not, as Mr. Swinton thinks,due to its impedance or increased ohmic resistance, but principally to thepresence of rarefied gas in the bulb. Ample evidence of the truth of this can beobtained in vary many experiments, and to cite them would be merely lengtheningthis communication unduly. Likewise, observations made when the experimenter’s body was included in thepath of the discharge, are, in my opinion, not impedance, but capacity,phenomena. The spark between the hands is the shorter, the larger the surface ofthe body, and no spark whatever would, be, obtained if the surface of the bodywere sufficiently large. I would here point out that one is apt to fall into the error of supposingthat the spark which is produced between two points on a conductor, not verydistant from each other, is due to the impedance of the conductor. This iscertainly the case when the current is of considerable strength. But when thereis a vibration along a wire which is constantly maintained, and the current isinappreciable whereas the potential at the coil terminal is exceedingly high,then lateral dissipation comes into play prominently. There is then owing tothis dissipation, a rapid fall of potential along the wire and high potentialdifferences may exist between points only a short distance apart This is ofcourse not to be confounded with those differences of potential observed betweenpoints when there are fixed wares with ventral and nodal points maintained on aconductor. The lateral dissipation, and not the skin effect, is, I think, thereason why so great an amount of energy may be passed into the body of a personwithout causing discomfort. It always affords me great pleasure to note; that something which I havesuggested is being employed for some instructive or practical purpose; but I maybe pardoned for mentioning that other observations made by Mr. Swinton, and byother experimenters, have recently been brought forward as novel, andarrangements of apparatus which I have suggested have been used repeatedly bysome who apparently are in complete ignorance of what I have done in thisdirection. Nikola Tesla From Nikola Tesla - He Writes about His Experiments in Electrical Healing The Detroit Free Press — Feb. 16, 1896 Some weeks ago this journal published an interesting article concerningelectrical oscillations as observed by the eminent scientist, Nicola Tesla. Somuch interest was shown in the subject that Mr. Tesla was appealed to directlyand in response to that appeal he sends to The Detroit Free Press this openletter: Nos. 46 & 48 E. Houston Street New York, February 10, 1896 During the past few weeks I have received so many letters concerning the samesubject that it was entirely beyond my power to answer all of them individually.In view of this I hope that I shall be excused for the delay, which I mustregret, in acknowledging the receipt, and also for addressing this generalcommunication in answer to all inquiries. The many pressing demands which have been made upon me in consequence ofexaggerated statements of the journals have painfully impressed me with the factthat there are a great many sufferers, and furthermore that nothing finds a morepowerful echo than a promise held out to improve the condition of theunfortunate ones. The members of the medical fraternity are naturally more deeply interested inthe task of relieving the suffering from their pain, and, as might be expected,a great many communications have been addressed to me by physicians. To thesechiefly this brief statement of the actual facts is addressed. Some journals have confounded the physiological effects of electricaloscillations with those of mechanical vibrations, this being probably due to thecircumstance that a few years ago I brought to the attention of the scientificmen some novel methods and apparatus for the production of electricaloscillations which, I learn, are now largely used in some modification or otherin electro-therapeutic treatment and otherwise. To dispel this erroneous idea Iwish to state that the effects of purely mechanical vibrations which I have morerecently observed, have nothing to do with the former. Mechanical vibrations have often been employed locally with pronouncedresults in the treatment of diseases, but it seems that the effects I refer tohave either not been noted at all, or if so, only to a small degree, evidentlybecause of the insufficiency of the means which have eventually been employed inthe investigations. While experimenting with a novel contrivance, constituting in its simplestform a vibrating mechanical system, in which from the nature of the constructionthe applied force is always in resonance with the natural period, I frequentlyexposed my body to continued mechanical vibrations. As the elastic force can bemade as large as desired, and the applied force used be very small, greatweights, half a dozen persons, for instance, may be vibrated with great rapidityby a comparatively small apparatus. I observed that such intense mechanical vibrations produce remarkablephysiological effects. They affect powerfully the condition of the stomach,undoubtedly promoting the process of digestion and relieving the feeling ofdistress, often experienced in consequence of the imperfect function of theorgans concerned in the process. They have a strong influence upon the liver,causing it to discharge freely, similarly to an application of a catharic. Theyalso seem to affect the glandular system, notable in the limbs; also the kidneysand bladder, and more or less influence the whole body. When applied for alonger period they produce a feeling of immense fatigue, so that a profoundsleep is induced. The excessive tiring of the body is generally accompanied by nervousrelaxation, but-there seems to be besides a specific action on the nerves. These observations, though incomplete, are, in my own limited judgment,nevertheless positive and unmistakable, and in view of this and of theimportance of further investigation of the subject by competent men I preparedabout a year ago a machine with suitable adjustments for varying the frequencyand amplitude of the vibrations, intending to give it to some medical facultyfor investigation. This machine, together with other apparatus, wasunfortunately destroyed by fire a year ago, but will be reconstructed as soon aspossible. In making the above statements I wish to disconnect myself with theextraordinary opinions expressed in some journals which I have never authorizedand which, though they may have been made with good intent, cannot fail to behurtful by giving rise to visionary expectations. Yours very truly, N. Tesla Tesla’s Latest Results: He Now Produces Radiographs At A Distance of More ThanForty Feet Electrical Review - N. Y. — March 18, 1896 To The Editor of Electrical Review: Permit me to say that I was slightly disappointed to note in your issue of Mar.11 the prominence you have deemed to accord to my youth and talent, while theribs and other particulars of which, with reference to the print accompanying mycommunication, I described as clearly visible, were kept modestly in thebackground. I also regretted to observe an error in one of the captions, themore so, as I must ascribe it to my own text. I namely stated on page 135, thirdcolumn, seventh line: \"A similar impression was obtained through the body of theexperimenter, etc., through a distance of four feet.\" The general truth of thefact of taking such a shadow at the distance given is concerned, your captionmight as well stand, for I am producing strong shadows at distances of 40 feet.I repeat, 40 feet and even more. Nor is this all. So strong are the actions onthe film that provisions must be made to guard the plates in my photographicdepartment, located on the floor above, a distance of fully 60 feet, from beingspoiled by long exposure to the stray rays. Though during my investigations Ihave performed many experiments which seemed extraordinary, I am deeplyastonished observing these unexpected manifestations, and still more so, as evennow I see before me the possibility, not to say certitude, of augmenting theeffects with my apparatus at least tenfold! What may we then expect? We have todeal here, evidently, with a radiation of astonishing power, and the inquiryinto its nature becomes more and more interesting and important. Here is anunlooked-for result of an action which, though wonderful in itself, seemedfeeble and entirely incapable of such expansion, and affords a good example ofthe fruitfulness of original discovery. These effects upon the sensitive plateat so great a distance I attribute to the employment of a bulb with a singleterminal, which permits the use of practically any desired potential and theattainment of extraordinary speeds of the projected particles. With such a bulbit is also evident that the action upon a fluorescent screen is proportionatelygreater than when the usual kind of tube is employed, and I have alreadyobserved enough to feel sure that great developments are to be looked for inthis direction. I consider Roentgen’s discovery, of enabling us to see, by theuse of a fluorescent screen, through an opaque substance, even a more beautifulone than the recording upon the plate. Since my previous communication to you I have made considerable progress,and can presently announce one more result of importance. I have lately obtainedshadows by reflected rays only, thus demonstrating beyond doubt that theRoentgen rays possess this property. One of the experiments may be cited here. Athick copper tube, about a foot long, was taken and one of its ends tightlyclosed by the plateholder containing a sensitive plate, protected by a fibercover as usual. Near the open end of the copper tube was placed a thick plate ofglass at an angle of 45 degrees to the axis of the tube. A single-terminal bulbwas then suspended above the glass plate at a distance of about eight inches, sothat the bundle of rays fell upon the latter at an angle of 45 degrees, and thesupposedly reflected rays passed along the axis of the copper tube. An exposureof 45 minutes gave a clear and sharp shadow of a metallic object. This shadowwas produced by the reflected rays, as the direct action was absolutelyexcluded, it having been demonstrated that even under the severest tests withmuch stronger actions no impression whatever could be produced upon the filmthrough a thickness of copper equal to that of the tube. Concluding from theintensity of the action by comparison with an equivalent effect due to thedirect rays, I find that approximately two per cent of the latter were reflectedfrom the glass plate in this experiment. I hope to be able to report shortly andmore fully on this and other subjects. In my attempts to contribute my humble share to the knowledge of theRoentgen phenomena, I am finding more and more evidence in support of the theoryof moving material particles. It is not my intention, however, to advance atpresent any view as to the bearing of such a fact upon the present theory oflight, but I merely seek to establish the fact of the existence of such materialstreams in so far as these isolated effects are concerned. I have already agreat many indications of a bombardment occurring outside of the bulb, and I amarranging some crucial tests which, I hope, will be successful. The calculatedvelocities fully account for actions at distances of as much as 100 feet fromthe bulb, and that the projection through the glass takes place seems evidentfrom the process of exhaustion, which I have described in my previouscommunication. An experiment which is illustrative in this respect, and which Iintended to mention, is the following; If we attach a fairly exhausted bulbcontaining an electrode to the terminal of a disruptive coil, we observe smallstreamers breaking through the side of the glass. Usually such a streamer willbreak through the seal and crack the bulb, whereupon the vacuum is impaired;but, if the seal is placed above the terminal, or if some other provision ismade to prevent the streamer from passing through the glass at that point, itoften occurs that the stream breaks out through the side of the bulb, producinga fine hole. Now, the extraordinary thing is that, in spite of the connection tothe outer atmosphere, the air can not rush into the bulb as long as the hole ‘isvery small. The glass at the place where the rupture has occurred may grow veryhot — to such a degree as to soften; but it will not collapse, but rather bulgeout, showing that a pressure from the inside greater than that of the atmosphereexists. On frequent occasions I have observed that the glass bulges out and thehole, through which the streamer rushes out, becomes so large as to be perfectlydiscernible to the eye. As the matter is expelled from the bulb the rarefactionincreases and the streamer becomes less and less intense, whereupon the glasscloses again, hermetically sealing the opening. The process of rarefaction,nevertheless, continues, streamers being still visible on the heated place untilthe highest degree of exhaustion is reached, whereupon they may disappear. Here,then, we have a positive evidence that matter is being expelled through thewalls of the glass. When working with highly strained bulbs I frequently experience a sudden,and sometimes even painful, shock in the eye. Such shocks may occur so oftenthat the eye gets inflamed, and one can not be considered over-cautious if heabstains from watching the bulb too closely. I see in these shocks a furtherevidence of larger particles being thrown off from the bulb. Nikola Tesla. New York, March 14. Mr. Tesla on Thermo Electricity The Electrical Engineer - N. Y. — December 23, 1896 In a letter to the editor of the Buffalo Enquirer, Mr. Nikola Tesla repliesas follows in regard to an inquiry on the subject of the future of electricity: \"The transmission of power has interested me not only as a technical problem,but far more in its bearing upon the welfare of mankind. In this sense I haveexpressed myself in a lecture, delivered some time ago. \"Since electrical transmission of energy is a process much more economicalthan any other we know of, it necessarily must play an important part in thefuture, no matter how the primary energy is derived from the sun. Of all theways the utilization of a waterfall seems to be the simplest and least wasteful.Even if we could, by combining carbon in a battery, convert the work of thechemical combination into electrical energy with very high economy, such mode ofobtaining power would, in my opinion, be no more than a mere makeshift, bound tobe replaced sooner or later by a more perfect method, which implies noconsumption of any material whatever.\" N. Tesla Tesla’s Latest Advances in Vacuum-tube Lighting. Application of Tubes of HighIlluminating Power to Photography and Other Purposes Electrical Review - N. Y. — Jan. 5, 1898 To the Editor of Electrical Review: A few years ago I began a series of experiments with a view of ascertainingthe applicability of the light emitted by phosphorescent vacuum tubes toordinary photography. The results soon showed that, even with a tube giving nomore light than the equivalent of one half of a candle, objects could be easilyphotographed with exposures of a few minutes, and the time could be reduced atwill by pushing the tube to a high candlepower. Photographs of persons werelikewise obtained at that time and, if I am not mistaken, these were the firstlikenesses produced with this kind of illumination. However, a number of facts,not pertaining to the subject presently considered, were observed in the courseof the experiments which, had they been immediately published, might havematerially hastened important scientific developments which have taken placesince. To dwell on these and other experimental results obtained at that time,more extensively at the first opportunity, is one of my good resolutions for thecoming year. A calamity unfortunately, interrupted my labors for a short period,but as soon as I was able I took up again the thread of the investigation, whichwas not only interesting in connection with the principal object in view, butwas also useful in many other respects. So, for instance, in making observationsas to the efficiency or any peculiarity of the vacuum tubes, the photographicplate was found to be an excellent means of comparison, note being taken of thedistance and time of exposure, character of the phosphorescent body, degree ofrarefaction and other such particulars of the moment. A rather curious feature in the photographs obtained with tubes of moderateilluminating power, as a few candles, was that the lights and shadows came outremarkably strong, as when very short exposures are made by flashlight, but theoutlines were not sharp and practically no detail was visible. By producingtubes of much greater candlepower, a notable improvement in this respect waseffected, and this advance prompted me to further efforts in this direction,which finally resulted in the production of a tube of an illuminating power ofequal to that of hundreds, and even thousands, of ordinary vacuum tubes. What ismore, I believe that I am far from having attained the limit in the amount oflight producible, and believe that this method of illumination will beeventually employed for lighthouse purposes. This probably will be consideredthe oddest and most unlooked-for development of the vacuum tube. Simultaneously with this progress a corresponding improvement was made in theefficiency of the light produced. A few words on this point might not be amiss,considering that a popular and erroneous opinion still exists in regard to thepower consumed by vacuum tubes lighted by ordinary means. So deeply rooted isthis opinion which, I will frankly confess, I myself shared for a long time,that, shortly after my own first efforts, Sir David Solomons and Messrs. Pike &Harris undertook to introduce in England such tubes on a large scale incompetition with the incandescent system of lighting. The enterprise, which wascommented on in the technical periodicals, was commendable enough, but it wasnot difficult to foretell its fate; for although the high-frequency currentsobtained from the alternator yielded better economical results than interruptedcurrents, and although they were obtained in a convenient and fairly economicalmanner, still the efficiency of the whole system was necessarily too small forcompetition with incandescent lamps. The reason for the great power consumption,which may often be as much as 10 times that taking place in incandescent lampsfor an equivalent amount of light, are not far to seek. A vacuum tube,particularly if it be very large, offers an immense radiating surface, and iscapable of giving off a great amount of energy without rising perceptibly intemperature. What still increases the dissipation of energy is the hightemperature of the rarefied gas. Generally it is supposed that the particles arenot brought to a high temperature, but a calculation from the amount of mattercontained in the tube, leads to results which would seem to indicate that, ofall the means at disposal for bringing a small amount of matter to a hightemperature, the vacuum tube is the most effective. This observation may lead tovaluable uses of such tubes in astronomical researches, and a line of experimentto this end was suggested to me recently by Dr. Geo. E. Hale, of the YerkesObservatory. As compared with these disadvantages the incandescent lamp, crudeand inefficient as it undoubtedly is, possesses vastly superior features. Thesedifficulties have been recognized by me early, and my efforts during the pastfew years have been directed towards overcoming these defects and have finallyresulted in material advances, so that I find it possible to obtain from a tubeof a volume not much greater than that of a bulb of an incandescent lamp, aboutthe same amount of light produced by the latter, without the tube becomingoverheated, which is sure to take place under ordinary conditions. Both of theseimprovements, the increase of candle-power as well as degree of efficiency, havebeen achieved by gradual perfection of the means of producing economicallyharmonical electrical vibrations of extreme rapidity. The fundamental principleinvolved is now well known, and it only remains to describe the features of thesystem in detail, a duty with which I expect to be able to comply soon, thisbeing another one of my good resolutions. The purpose of the present communication is chiefly to give an idea in howfar the object here aimed at was obtained. The photographs shown were taken by atube having a radiating surface of about two hundred square inches. Thefrequency of the oscillations, which were obtained from an Edison direct-currentsupply circuit, I estimated to be about two million a second. The illuminatingpower of the tube approximated about one thousand candles, and the exposuresranged from two to five seconds, the distance of the object being four to fivefeet from the tube. It might be asked why, with so high an illuminating power,the exposures should not be instantaneous. I would not undertake tosatisfactorily answer this question, which was put to me recently by ascientific man, whose visit to my laboratory I still vividly recollect.Likenesses can, of course, be obtained with instantaneous exposures, but it hasbeen found preferable to expose longer and at a greater distance from the tube.The results so far obtained would make it appear that this kind of light will beof great value in photography, not only because the artist will be able toexactly adjust the conditions in every experiment so as to secure the bestresult, which is impossible with ordinary light. He will thus be made entirelyindependent of daylight, and will be able to carry on his work at any hour,night or day. It might also be of value to the painter, though its use for suchpurposes I still consider problematical. Nikola Tesla New York, Jan. 3 Tesla on Animal Training by Electricity New York Journal — Feb. 6, 1898 To the Editor of the Journal: It seems to me that there are interesting possibilities in the training ofanimals by electricity. Of course,. it’s rather out of my province, but the ideaof the electrical subjugator appears feasible when one knows the power ofelectricity and the instinctive fear that brutes have of the unknown. And theelectrical method seems more humane than those I believe are in use - the whip,red hot irons, and drugs, which are likely to do permanent injury, while thephysical effects of an electric shock are soon gone, only the moral onesremaining. The subjugator referred to will do the work, but I think an apparatus couldbe designed that would be less dangerous to the man. I do not desire to beunderstood as giving the matter deep thought, but believe that if instead of thearmored backpad, the trainer used a wand, with two prongs at one end, betterresults would follow. This wand would be connected with the supply cables andcould be applied to any part of the animal’s body at will. Its operation wouldbe precisely the same as the subjugator here illustrated, the two prongssupplying the positive and negative poles of contact found in the flattenedwires. With this wand an animal could be simply shocked, stunned or killed, asrequired. To cure animals of jumping at men in cages, a screen of stout but flexiblewire could be stretched between the trainer and his subject, the wires to bealternately positive and negative, and connected through the regulator with thedynamo. After a couple of springs which would hurl him half insensible back intohis corner, the taste for unexpected jumps would leave the brute. [The following article appeared with the above.-Ed] Prague, Jan. 22. Science has come to aid the lion tamer in subduing the wild beast. The redhot iron will, in future, be cast aside as unnecessary and out of date. Livewires, surcharged with electricity that baffle the lion’s fiercest assaults, andburn and maim him badly have taken the place of the lash and scorching iron. Alion tamer of Austria, Louis Koemmenich, has been the first to call in theassistance of the lightning to subdue wild beasts. Koemmenich has invented what he calls the electrical subjugator. This is ashield of electric wires that fasten on the back of the lion tamer and areconnected with a dynamo by a wire coil of sufficient length to allow Koemmenichto move around the cage. In his hand he will carry a charged metal ball on an insulated handle, to beused as the red hot iron was in former days. The dynamo is operated by an assistant outside of the cage. Should a lion show a disposition to leap on Koemmenich, he invites attack bydeliberately turning his back to the lion and apparently encouraging theonslaught. When the beast springs his paws come in contact with the electricshield, and he receives a shock of 1,500 volts from the dynamo. The operator can, if necessary, increase the voltage so as to shock theanimal to death. Thus far the device has worked like magic. One dose of lightning issufficient for the average lion. Whips and even hot irons they have dared, butno animal has yet troubled Koemmenich after receiving into its body 1,500 voltsfrom the electric subjugator. Whenever Koemmenich enters the cage after anencounter with a lion that has run against the electrical subjugator, he willcower away into a corner of the cage, and never need any further punishment. Nikola Tesla Letter to Editor Electrical Engineer - N. Y. — Nov. 24, 1898 New York, Nov. 18, 1898 46 & 48 East Houston St. Editor of The Electrical Engineer, 120 Liberty St., New York City: Sir - By publishing in your columns of Nov. 17 my recent contribution to theElectro-Therapeutic Society you have finally succeeded - after many vainattempts made during a number of years - in causing me a serious injury. It hascost me great pains to write that paper, and I have expected to see it appearamong other dignified contributions of its kind, and I confess, the wound isdeep. But you will have no opportunity for inflicting a similar one, as Ipropose to take better care of my papers in the future. In what manner you havesecured this one in advance of other electrical periodicals who had an equalright to the same, rests with the secretary of the society to explain. Your editorial comment would not concern me in the least, were it not my dutyto take note of it. On more than one occasion you have offended me, but in myqualities both as Christian and philosopher I have always forgiven you and onlypitied you for your errors. This time, though, your offence is graver than theprevious ones, for you have dared to cast a shadow on my honor. No doubt you must have in your possession, from the illustrious men whom youquote, tangible proofs in support of your statement reflecting on my honesty.Being a bearer of great honors from a number of American universities, it is myduty, in view of the slur thus cast upon them, to exact from you that in yournext issue you produce these, together with this letter, which in justice tomyself, I am forwarding to other electrical journals. In the absence of suchproofs, I require that, together with the preceding, you publish instead acomplete and humble apology for your insulting remark which reflects on me aswell as on those who honor me. On this condition I will again forgive you; but I would advise you to limityourself in your future attacks to statements for which you are not liable to bepunished by law. N. Tesla Tesla Describes His Efforts in Various Fields of Work The Sun, New York, November 21, 1898 To the Editor of the Sun Sir: Had it not been for other urgent duties, I would before this haveacknowledged your highly appreciative editorial of November 13. Such earnestcomments and the frequent evidences of the highest appreciation of my labors bymen who are the recognized leaders of this day in scientific speculation,discovery and invention are a powerful stimulus, and I am thankful for them.There is nothing that gives me so much strength and courage as the feeling thatthose who are competent to judge have faith in me. Permit me on this occasion to make a few statements which will define myposition in the various fields of investigation you have touched upon. I can not but gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to earlier workers, asDr. Hertz and Dr. Lodge, in my efforts to produce a practical and economicallighting system on the lines which I first disclosed in a lecture at ColumbiaCollege in 1891. There exists a popular error in regard to this light, inasmuchas it is believed that it can be obtained without generation of heat. Theenthusiasm of Dr. Lodge is probably responsible for this error, which I havepointed out early by showing the impossibility of reaching a high vibrationwithout going through the lower or fundamental tones. On purely theoreticalgrounds such a result is thinkable, but it would imply a device for starting thevibrations of unattainable qualities, inasmuch as it would have to be entirelydevoid of inertia and other properties of matter. Though I have conceptions inthis regard, I dismiss for the present this proposition as being impossible. Wecan not produce light without heat, but we can surely produce a more efficientlight than that obtained in the incandescent lamp, which, though a beautifulinvention, is sadly lacking in the feature of efficiency. As the first steptoward this realization, I have found it necessary to invent some method fortransforming economically the ordinary currents as furnished from the lightingcircuits into electrical vibrations of great rapidity. This was a difficultproblem, and it was only recently that I was able to announce its practical andthoroughly satisfactory solution. But this was not the only requirement in asystem of this kind. It was necessary also to increase the intensity of thelight, which at first was very feeble. In this direction, too, I met withcomplete success, so that at present I am producing a thoroughly serviceable andeconomical light of any desired intensity. I do not mean to say that this systemwill revolutionize those in use at present, which have resulted from thecooperation of many able men. I am only sure that it will have its fields ofusefulness. As to the idea of rendering the energy of the sun available for industrialpurposes, it fascinated me early but I must admit it was only long after Idiscovered the rotating magnetic field that it took a firm hold upon my mind. Inassailing the problem I found two possible ways of solving it. Either power wasto be developed on the spot by converting the energy of the sun’s radiations orthe energy of vast reservoirs was to be transmitted economically to anydistance. Though there were other possible sources of economical power, only thetwo solutions mentioned offer the ideal feature of power being obtained withoutany consumption of material. After long thought I finally arrived at twosolutions, but on the first of these, namely, that referring to the developmentof power in any locality from the sun’s radiations, I can not dwell at present.The system of power transmission without wires, in the form in which I havedescribed it recently, originated in this manner. Starting from two facts thatthe earth was a conductor insulated in space, and that a body can not be chargedwithout causing an equivalent displacement of electricity in the earth, Iundertook to construct a machine suited for creating as large a displacement aspossible of the earth’s electricity. This machine was simply to charge and discharge in rapid succession a bodyinsulated in space, thus altering periodically the amount of electricity in theearth, and consequently the pressure all over its surface. It was nothing butwhat in mechanics is a pump, forcing water from a large reservoir into a smallone and back again. Primarily I .contemplated only the sending of messages togreat distances in this manner, and I described the scheme in detail, pointingout on that occasion the importance of ascertaining certain electricalconditions of the earth. The attractive feature of this plan was that theintensity of the signals should diminish very little with the distance, and, infact, should not diminish at all, if it were not for certain losses occurring,chiefly in the atmosphere. As all my previous ideas, this one, too, received thetreatment of Marsyas, but it forms, nevertheless, the basis of what is now knownas \"wireless telegraphy.\" This statement will bear rigorous examination, but itis not made with the intent of detracting from the merit of others. On thecontrary, it is with great pleasure that I acknowledge the early work of Dr.Lodge, the brilliant experiments of Marconi, and of a later experimenter in thisline, Dr. Slaby, of Berlin. Now, this idea I extended to a system of powertransmission, and I submitted it to Helmholtz on the occasion of his visit tothis country. He unhesitatingly said that power could certainly be transmittedin this manner, but he doubted that I could ever produce an apparatus capable ofcreating the high pressures of a number of million volts, which were required toattack the problem with any chance of success, and that I could overcome thedifficulties of insulation. Impossible as this problem seemed at first, I wasfortunate to master it in a comparatively short time, and it was in perfectingthis apparatus that I came to a turning point in the development of this idea.I, namely, at once observed that the air, which is a perfect insulator forcurrents produced by ordinary apparatus, was easily traversed by currentsfurnished by my improved machine, giving a tension of something like 2,500,000volts. A further investigation in this direction led to another valuable fact;namely, that the conductivity of the air for these currents increased veryrapidly with its degree of rarefaction, and at once the transmission of energythrough the upper strata of air, which, without such results as I have obtained,would be nothing more than a dream, became easily realizable. This appears allthe more certain, as I found it quite practicable to transmit, under conditionssuch as exist in heights well explored, electrical energy in large amounts. Ihave thus overcome all the chief obstacles which originally stood in the way,and the success of my system now rests merely on engineering skill. Referring to my latest invention, I wish to bring out a point which has beenoverlooked. I arrived, as has been stated, at the idea through entirely abstractspeculations on the human organism, which I conceived to be a self-propellingmachine, the motions of which are governed by impressions received through theeye. Endeavoring to construct a mechanical model resembling in its essential,material features the human body, I was led to combine a controlling device, ororgan sensitive to certain waves, with a body provided with propelling anddirecting mechanism, and the rest naturally followed. Originally the ideainterested me only from the scientific point of view, but soon I saw that I hadmade a departure which sooner or later must produce a profound change in thingsand conditions presently existing. I hope this change will be for the good only,for, if it were otherwise, I wish that I had never made the invention. Thefuture may or may not bear out my present convictions, but I can not refrainfrom saying that it is difficult for me to see at present how, with such aprinciple brought to great perfection, as it undoubtedly will be in the courseof time, guns can maintain themselves as weapons. We shall be able, by availingourselves of this advance, to send a projectile at much greater distance, itwill not be limited in any way by weight or amount of explosive charge, we shallbe able to submerge it at command, to arrest it in its flight, and call it back,and to send it out again and explode it at will, and, more than this, it willnever make a miss, since all chance in this regard, if hitting the object ofattack were at all required, is eliminated. But the chief feature of such aweapon is still to be told; namely, it may be made to respond only to a certainnote or tune, it may be endowed with selective power. Directly such an arm isproduced, it becomes almost impossible to meet it with a correspondingdevelopment. It is this feature, perhaps, more than in its power of destruction,that its tendency to arrest the development of arms and to stop warfare willreside. With renewed thanks, I remain, Very truly, yours, N. Tesla New York, November 19 Electrical oscillator activity ten million Horsepower Burning atmosphericnitrogen by high frequency discharges twelve million volts. January 1. 1904 I wish to announce that in connection with the commercial introduction of myinventions I shall render professional services in the general capacity ofconsulting electrician and engineer. The near future, I expect with confidence, will be a witness of revolutionarydepartures in the production, transformation and transmission of energy,transportation, lighting, manufacture of chemical compounds, telegraphy,telephony and other arts and industries. In my opinion, these advances are certain to follow from the universaladoption of high-potential and high-frequency currents and novel regenerativeprocesses of refrigeration to very low temperatures. Much of the old apparatus will have to be improved, and much of the newdeveloped, and I believe that while furthering my own inventions, I shall bemore helpful in this evolution by placing at the disposal of others theknowledge and experience I have gained. Special attention will be given by me to the solution of problems requiringboth expert information and inventive resource — work coming within the sphereof my constant training and predilection. I shall undertake the experimental investigation and perfection of ideas,methods and appliances, the devising of useful expedients and, in particular,the design and construction of machinery for the attainment of desired results. Any task submitted to and accepted by me, will be carried out thoroughly andconscientiously. Nikola Tesla Laboratory, Long Island, N. Y. Residence, Waldorf, New York City Letter from Nikola Tesla New York Sun — November 27, 1904 My attention has been called to numerous comments on my letter, published inyour issue of November 1, and relating to the electrical equipment of the newlyopened catacomb in this city. Some of them are based on erroneous assumptions,which it is necessary for me to correct. When I stated that my system was adopted, I did not mean that I originatedevery electrical appliance in the subway. For instance, the one which that illfated electrician was repairing when he was killed, two days after the catacombwas ready for public use, was not invented by me. Nor was that other device onthe sidetracked car, which, as will be remembered, caused the burning of twomen. I also must deny any connection with that switch or contrivance which wasresponsible for the premature death of a man immediately afterward, as well aswith that other, which cut short the life of his unfortunate successor. None ofthese funeral devices, I emphatically state, or any of the other which broughton collisions, delays and various troubles and were instrumental in the loss ofarms and legs of several victims, are of my invention, nor do they form, in myopinion, necessary appurtenances of an intelligently planned scheme for thepropulsion of cars. Referring to these contrivances, it is significant to readin some journals of the 8th inst. that a small firm failed because their bid wastoo low. This is indicative of keen competition and sharp cutting of prices, anddoes not seem in keeping with the munificence claimed for the InterboroughCompany. I merely intended to say in my letter that my system of power transmissionwith three-phase generators and synchronous motor converters was adopted in thesubway, the same as on the elevated road. I devised it many years ago for theexpress purpose of meeting the varied wants of a general electrical distributionof light and power. It has been extensively introduced all over the worldbecause of its great flexibility, and under such conditions of use has beenfound of great value. But the idea of employing in this great city’s mainartery, in a case presenting such rigid requirements, this flexible system,offering innumerable chances for breakdowns, accidents and injuries to life andproperty, is altogether too absurd to dignify it with any serious comment. Hereonly my multiphase system, with induction motors and closed coil armatures -apparatus unfailing in its operation and minimizing the dangers of travel -should have been installed. Nothing, not even ignorance, will prevent itsultimate adoption; and the sooner the change is made the better it will be forall concerned. Personally, I have no financial or other interest in the matter,except that as a long resident of this city I would have been glad to see myinventions properly used to the advantage of the community. Under thecircumstances I must forego this gratification. The consequences of the unpardonable mistake of the Interborough Company arenot confined to this first subway or even to this city. We are driven to travelunderground. The elevated road is the eighth wonder, as colossal and imposing inthe feature of public forbearance as the Pyramid of Cheops in its dimensions.Sooner or later all interurban railways must be transformed into subterranean.This will call for immense investments of capital, and if defective electricalapparatus is generally adopted the damage to life and property will beincalculable, not to speak of inconvenience to the public. It seems proper to me to acknowledge on this occasion the painstakingsuggestions of some friends of mine, mostly unknown to me, both in the largedomain of electrical achievement and in the small sphere of my friendship, toagain address the American Institute. It is customary with scientific men topresent an original subject only once. I have done so and do not desire todepart from this established precedent. A lecture on the defects of the subwayoffers great opportunities, but would not be original. In view of certaininsinuations I may cite a recently published statement of Mr. C. F. Scott,formerly president of the American Institute: ‘n a matter of history it is theTesla principle and the Tesla system which have been the directing factors inmodern electrical engineering practice.’ There are but a few men whoseacknowledgment of my own work I would quote. Mr. Scott is one of them, as theman whose co-operation was most efficient in bringing about the great industrialrevolution through these inventions. But the suggestions of my good friends havefallen on fruitful ground, and should it be possible for me to spare time andenergy I may ask the city authorities for power to investigate the subway, andmake a sworn report to them on all the defects and deficiencies I may discover,in the interest of public welfare. A few more words in relation to the signs. With all due respect to generalopinion, I entertain quite a different view on that subject. Advertising is auseful art, which is being lifted continually to a higher plane, and will soonbe quite respectable. It should not be hampered, but rather encouraged. I wouldgive the Interborough Company every facility for exploiting it, restricting itonly in so far as the artistic execution is concerned. A commission of capablemen comprising a painter, a sculptor, an architect, a literary man, an engineerand an executive business man might be appointed, to pass upon the merits of thesigns submitted for acceptance. I do not see why the public should object tothem if they were regulated in this manner. They will further business, maketravel less tedious, and help many skillful artisans. The subways are bound tobecome municipal property, and the city will then derive a revenue from them.What is most important for the safety of life and property, quickness andsecurity of travel, should be first considered. All this depends on theelectrical equipment. The engineers have built a good tunnel, and properapparatus should be installed to match it. Nikola Tesla New York, Nov. 26 Electric Autos Manufacturers’ Record — Dec. 29, 1904 Mr. Albert Phenis, Special Correspondent Manufacturers’ Record, New York: Dear Sir - Replying to your inquiry of yesterday, the application ofelectricity to the propulsion of automobiles is certainly a rational idea. I amglad to know that Mr. Lieb has undertaken to put it into practice. His longexperience with the General Electric Co. and other concerns must haveexcellently fitted him for the task. There is no doubt that a highly-successful machine can be produced on theselines. The field is inexhaustible, and this new type of automobile, introducingelectricity between the prime mover and the wheels, has, in my opinion, a greatfuture. I have myself for many years advocated this principle. Your will find innumerous technical publications statements made by me to this effect. In myarticle in the Century, June, 1900, I said, in dealing with the subject:‘Steamers and trains are still being propelled by the direct application ofsteam power to shafts or axles. A much greater percentage of the heat energy ofthe fuel could be transformed in motive energy by using, in place of the adoptedmarine engines and locomotives, dynamos driven by specially designedhigh-pressure steam or gas engines, by utilizing the electricity generated forthe propulsion. Again of 50 to 100 percent, in the effective energy derived fromthe fuel could be secured in this manner. It is difficult to understand why afact so plain and obvious is not receiving more attention from engineers. At first glance it may appear that to generate electricity by an engine andthen apply the current to turn a wheel, instead of turning it by means of somemechanical connection with the engine, is a complicated and more or lesswasteful process. But it is not so; on the contrary, the use of electricity inthis manner secures great practical advantages. It is but a question of timewhen this idea will be extensively applied to railways and also to ocean liners,though in the latter case the conditions are not quite so favorable. How therailroad companies can persist in using the ordinary locomotive is a mystery. Byproviding an engine generating electricity and operating with the current motorsunder the cars a train can be propelled with greater speed and moreeconomically. In France this has already been done by Heilman, and although hismachinery was not the best, the results he obtained were creditable andencouraging. I have calculated that a notable gain in speed and economy can alsobe secured in ocean liners, on which the improvement is particularly desirablefor many reasons. It is very likely that in the near future oil will be adoptedas fuel, and that will make the new method of propulsion all the morecommendable. The electric manufacturing companies will scarcely be able to meetthis new demand for generators and motors. In automobiles practically nothing has been done in this direction, and yetit would seem they offer the greatest opportunities for application of thisprinciple. The question, however, is which motor to employ - the direct-currentor my induction motor. The former has certain preferences as regards thestarting and regulation, but the commutators and brushes are very objectionableon an automobile. In view of this I would advocate the use of the inductionmotor as an ideally simple machine which can never get out of order. Theconditions are excellent, inasmuch as a very low frequency is practicable andmore than three phases can be used. The regulation should offer littledifficulty, and once an automobile on this novel plan is produced its advantageswill be readily appreciated. Yours very truly, N. Tesla Tesla on Subway Dangers New York Sun, June 16, 1905 The flooding of the subway is a calamity apt to repeat itself. As yourreaders will remember, it did not occur for the first time last Sunday. Water,like fire, will break loose occasionally in spite of precautions. It will neverbe possible to guard against a casual bursting of a main; for while the conduitcan be safely relied upon under normal working conditions, any accidentalobstruction to the flow may cause a pressure which no pipe or joint canwithstand. In fact, if we are to place faith in the gloomy forecasts of CommissionerOakley, who ought to know, such floods may be expected to happen frequently inthe future. In view of this it seems timely to call to public attention a dangerinherent to the electrical equipment which has been thrust upon the InterboroughCompany by incompetent advisers. The subway is bound to be successful, and would be so if the cars were drawnby mules, for it is the ideal means of transportation in crowded cities. But thefull measure of success of which it is capable will be attained only when thefinanciers shall say to the electric companies: \"Give us the best, regardless ofexpense.\" It is to be regretted that this important pioneering enterprise, in otherrespects ably managed and engineered, should have been treated with such grossneglect in its most vital feature. No opportunity was given to myself, theinventor and patentee of the system adopted in the subway and the elevatedroads, for offering some useful suggestion, nor was a single electrician orengineer of the General Electric and Westinghouse companies consulted, the verymen who should have been thought of first of all. Once large sums of money are invested in a defective scheme it is difficultto make a change, however desirable it may be. The movement of new capital islargely determined by previous investment. Even the new roads now planned arelikely to be equipped with the same claptrap devices, and so the evil will grow.\"Das eben ist der Fluch der boesen Thut, das sie fortzeugend Boeses mussgebaeren.\" The danger to which I refer lies in the possibility of generating anexplosive mixture by electrolytic decomposition and thermic dissociation of thewater through the direct currents used in the operation of the cars. Such aprocess might go on for hours and days without being noticed; and with currentsof this kind it is scarcely practicable to avoid it altogether. It will be recalled that an expert found the percentage of free oxygen in thesubway appreciably above that which might reasonably have been expected in sucha more or less stagnated channel. I have never doubted the correctness of thatanalysis and have assumed that oxygen is being continuously set free by straycurrents passing through the moist ground. The total amperage of the normalworking current in the tunnel is very great, and in case of flooding would besufficient to generate not far from 100 cubic feet of hydrogen per minute.Inasmuch, however, as in railway operation the fuses must be set hard, in orderto avoid frequent interruption of the service by their blowing out, in such anemergency the current would be of . much greater volume and hydrogen would bemore abundantly liberated. It is a peculiar property of this gas that it is capable of exploding whenmixed with a comparatively large volume of air, and any engineer can convincehimself by a simple calculation that, say, 100,000 cubic feet of explosive mightbe formed before the danger is discovered, reported and preventive measurestaken. What the effect of such an explosion might be on life and property is notpleasant to contemplate. True, such a disaster is not probable, but the presentelectrical equipment makes it possible, and this possibility should be, by allmeans, removed. The oppressiveness of the tunnel atmosphere is in a large measure due to theheat supplied by the currents, and to the production of nitrous acid in thearcs, which is enhanced by rarefaction of the air through rapid motion. Someprovision for ventilation is imperative. But ventilation will not do away withthe danger I have pointed out. It can be completely avoided only by discardingthe direct current. I should say that the city authorities, for this if for no other reason,should forbid its use by a proper act of legislation. Meanwhile, the owners ofadjacent property should object to its employment, and the insurance companiesshould refuse the grant of policies on such property except on terms which itmay please them to make. N. Tesla Tesla’s Reply to Edison English Mechanic and World of Science — July 14, 1905 As we said last week, Mr. Edison was reported to have said in an interview ofthe New York World that he did not believe Tesla would be able to talk round theworld, but that he thought Marconi would, sooner or later, perfect his system. Nikola Tesla has replied. He says:"},{"pageContent":" In the course of certain investigations which I carried on for the purpose ofstudying the effects of lightning discharges upon the electrical condition ofthe earth I observed that sensitive receiving instruments arranged so as to becapable of responding to electrical disturbances created by the discharges attimes failed to respond when they should have done so, and upon inquiring intothe causes of this unexpected behavior I discovered it to be due to thecharacter of the electrical waves which were produced in the earth by thelightning discharges, and which had nodal regions following at definitedistances the shifting source of the disturbances. From data obtained in a largenumber of observations of the maxima and minima of these waves I found theirlength to vary approximately from twenty-five to seventy kilometers, and theseresults and theoretical deductions led me to the conclusion that waves of thiskind may be propagated in all directions over the globe, and that they may be ofstill more widely differing lengths, the extreme limits being imposed by thephysical dimensions and properties of the earth. Recognizing in the existence ofthese waves an unmistakable evidence that the disturbances created had beenconducted from their origin to the most remote portions of the globe, and hadbeen thence reflected, I conceived the idea of producing such waves in the earthby artificial means, with the object of using them for many useful purposes forwhich they are or might be found applicable. Beat Lightning Flashes This problem was rendered extremely difficult, owing to the immensedimensions of the planet, and consequently enormous movement of electricity orrate at which electrical energy had to be delivered in order to approximate,even in a remote degree, movements or rates which are manifestly attained in thedisplays of electrical forces in nature, and which seemed at first unrealizableby any human agencies; but by gradual and continuous improvements of a generatorof electrical oscillations, which I have described in my Patents Nos. 645,576and 649,621, I finally succeeded in reaching electrical movements or rates ofdelivery of electrical energy not only approximately, but, as shown incomparative tests and measurements, actually surpassing those of lightningdischarges and by means of this apparatus I have found it possible to reproduce,whenever desired, phenomena in the earth the same as or similar to those due tosuch discharges. With the knowledge of the phenomena discovered by me, and themeans at command for accomplishing these results, I am enabled, not only tocarry out many operations by the use of known instruments, but also to offer asolution for many important problems involving the operation or control ofremote devices which, for want of this knowledge and the absence of these means,have heretofore been entirely impossible. For example, by the use of such agenerator of stationary waves and receiving apparatus properly placed andadjusted in any other locality, however remote, it is practicable to transmitintelligible signals, or to control or actuate at will any one or all of suchapparatus for many other important and valuable purposes, as for indicatingwhenever desired the correct time of an observatory, or for ascertaining therelative position of a body or distance of the same with reference to the givenpoint, or for determining the course of a moving object, such as a vessel atsea, the distance traversed by the same or its speed; or for producing manyother useful effects at a distance dependent on the intensity, wavelength,direction or velocity of movements, or other feature or property of disturbancesof this character. A Bit of Sarcasm Permit me to say on this occasion that if there exist to-day no facilitiesfor wireless telegraphic and telephone communication between the most distantcountries, it is merely because a series of misfortunes and obstacles havedelayed the consummation of my labors, which might have been completed threeyears ago. In this connection I shall well remember the efforts of some, unwiseenough to believe that they can gain an advantage by throwing sand in the eyesof the people and retarding the progress of invention. Should the first messagesacross the seas prove calamitous to them, it will be a punishment regrettablebut fully deserved. Nikola Tesla Tesla on the Peary North Pole Expedition New York Sun — July 16, 1905 To the Editor of the New York Sun: Everybody must have been pleased to learn that Commodore Peary has finallyobtained the financial assistance which will enable him to start without furtherdelay on his important journey. Let us wish the bold navigator the most completesuccess in his perilous undertaking, in the interest of humanity as well as forhis own and his companions’ sake and the gratification of the generous donorswho have aided him. But, while voicing these sentiments, let us hope thatPeary’s will be the last attempt to reach the pole in this slow, penible andhazardous way. We have already sufficiently advanced in the knowledge of electricity and itsapplications to avail ourselves of better means of transportation, enabling usto reach and to explore without difficulty and in a more perfect manner not onlythe North, but also the South Pole, and any other still unknown regions of theearth’s surface. I refer to the facilities afforded in this respect by thetransmission of electrical energy without wires and aerial navigation, which hasfound in the novel art its ideal solution. Many of your readers will, no doubt, be under the impression that I amspeaking merely of possibilities. As a matter of fact, from the principlesinvolved and the experiments which I have actually performed, not only is thepractical success of such distribution of power reduced to a degree ofmathematical certitude, but the transmission can be-effected with an economymuch greater than possible by the present method involving the use of wires. It would not take long to build a plant for purposes of aerial navigation andgeographical research, nor would it cost as much as might be supposed. Itslocation would be perfectly immaterial. It might be at the Niagara, or at theVictorian Falls in Africa, without any appreciable difference in the powercollected in a flying machine or other apparatus. A popular error, which I have often opportunity to correct, is to believethat the energy of such a plant would dissipate itself in all directions. Thisis not so, as I have pointed out in my technical publications. Electricity isdisplaced by the transmitter in all directions, equally through the earth andthe air; that is true, but energy is expended only at the place where it iscollected and used to perform some work. To illustrate, a plant of 10,000 hp,such as I have been planning, might be running full blast at Niagara, and theremight be but one flying machine, of, say, 50 hp operating in some distant place,the location being of absolutely no consequence. In this case 50 hp would be allthe power furnished by the plant to the rest of the universe. Although theelectrical oscillations would manifest themselves all over the earth, at thesurface as well as high in the air, virtually no power would be consumed. Myexperiments have shown that the entire electrical movement which keeps the wholeglobe a-tremble can be maintained with but a few horsepower. Apart from thetransmitting and receiving apparatus, the only loss incurred is the energyradiated in the form of Hertzian or electro-magnetic waves, which can be reducedto any entirely insignificant quantity. I appreciate the difficulty which your non-technical readers must experiencein comprehending the working of this system. To gain a rough idea, let themimagine the transmitter and the earth to be two elastic bags, one very small andthe other immense, both being connected by a tube and filled with someincompressible fluid. A pump is provided for forcing the fluid from one into theother, alternately and in rapid succession. Now, to produce a great movement ofthe fluid in a bag of such enormous size as the earth would require a pump solarge that it would be a greater task to construct it than to build a thousandEgyptian pyramids. But there is a way of accomplishing this with a pump of verysmall dimensions. The bag connected to the earth is elastic, and when suddenlystruck vibrates at a certain rate. The first artifice consists in so designingand adjusting the parts that the natural vibrations of the bag are insynchronism with the strokes of the pump. Under such conditions the bag is setinto violent vibrations, and the fluid is made to rush in and out with terrificforce. But the immense bag - the earth, is still comparatively undisturbed. Itssize, however, does not exempt it from the laws of nature, and just as the smallbag, so too the earth, responds to certain impulses. This fact I discovered in1899. The second artifice is to so adjust the transmitter that it will furnishthese particular impulses. When all is properly done the large bag is throwninto spasms of vibration, and the effects are bewildering. But no power is yettransmitted, and all this colossal movement requires little energy to maintain.It is like an engine running without load. Next let your readers imagine that at any place where it may be desired todeliver energy a small elastic bag, not unlike the first, is connected to thelarge one through a tube. The third artifice consists in so proportioning theparts that the attachment will be responsive to the impulse transmitted, thisresulting in a great intensification of the vibration of the bag. Still the pumpwill not furnish power until these vibrations are made to do work of some kind. To conduce to an understanding of the fourth artifice, that of\"individualization,\" let your readers follow me a step further, and conceive theflow of energy to any point can be controlled from the place where the pump islocated at will, and with equal facility and precision, regardless of distance,and, furthermore, through a device such as the combination lock of a safe, theywill then have a crude idea of the processes involved. But only when theyrealize that all these and many other processes not mentioned, and related toone another like the links of a chain, are completed in a fraction of a second,will your readers be able to appreciate the magical potencies of electricalvibrations and form a conception of the miracles which a skilled electrician canperform by the use of these appliances. I earnestly hope that in the near future the conditions will be favorable forthe construction of a plant such as I have proposed. As soon as this is done itwill be possible to adapt electrical motors to flying machines of the typepopularized by Santos Dumont. There will be no necessity of carrying a generatoror store of motive energy and consequently the machine will be much lighter andsmaller. Owing to this and also to the greater power available for propulsion,the speed will be considerably increased. But a few of such machines, properlyequipped with photographic and other appliances, will be sufficient to give usin a short time an exact knowledge of the entire earth’s surface. It should beborne in mind, however, that for the ordinary uses of a single person a verysmall machine of not more than one-quarter horse-power, corresponding to thework of two men, would be amply sufficient so that when the first plant of10,000 hp is installed, the commodity of aerial flight can be offered to a greatmany individuals all the world over. I can conceive of no improvement whichwould be more efficient in the furtherance of civilization than this. N. Tesla Signaling to Mars —A Problem of Electrical Engineering Harvard Illustrated — March, 1907 In the early part of 1900, still vividly impressed by certain observations, Ihad made shortly before, and feeling that the time had come to prepare the worldfor an experiment which will soon be undertaken, I dwelt on the practicabilityof interplanetary signaling in an article which appeared in the June number ofCentury Magazine of the same year. In order to correct an erroneous report whichgained wide circulation, a statement was published in Collier’s Weekly of Feb.9, 1901, defining my position in general terms. Ever since, my thoughts havebeen centered on the subject, and my original conviction has been strengthenedboth by reflection and suggestion. Chief among the stimulating influences was the revelatory work of PercivalLowell, described in a volume with which the observatory, bearing his name, hashonored me. No one can look at his globe of Mars without a feeling of profoundastonishment, if not awe. These markings, still imperfectly discerned andincomprehensible, but evidently intended for a useful purpose, may they notcontain a record of deep meaning left by a superior race, perhaps extinct, totell its young brethren in other worlds of secrets discovered, of life andstruggle, of their own terrible fate? What mighty pathos and love in such agigantic drama of the universe: But let us hope that the astronomer has seentrue, that Mars is not a cold grave, but the abode of happy intelligentcreatures, from whom we may learn. In the light of this glorious possibility,signaling to that planet presents itself as a preeminently practical propositionwhich, to carry out, no human sacrifice could be too great. Can it be done? Whatchance is there that it will be done? These questions will be answered definitely the moment all doubt as to theexistence of highly developed beings on Mars is dispelled. The straightness ofthe lines on Lowell’s map, their uniform width and other geometricalpeculiarities, do not, themselves, appeal to me as strong proofs ofartificiality. I should think that a planet large enough not to be frozen stiffin a spasm of volcanic action, like our moon, must, in the course of eons, haveall its mountains leveled, the valleys filled, the rocks ground to sand, andultimately assume the form of a smooth spheroid, with all its rivers flowing ingeodetically straight lines. The uniform width of the waterways can beconsistently explained, their crossings, however odd and puzzling, might beaccidental. But I quite agree with Professor Morse, that this whole wonderfulmap produces the absolute and irresistible conviction, that these \"canals\" owetheir existence to a guiding intelligence. Their great size is not a validargument to the contrary. It would merely imply that the Martians have harnessedthe energy of waterfalls. We know of no other source of power competent toexplain such tremendous feats of engineering. They could not be accomplished bycapturing the sun’s rays or abstracting heat imparted to the atmosphere, forthis, according to our best knowledge, would require clumsy and inefficientmachinery. Large falls could be obtained near the polar caps by extensive dams.While much less effective than our own, they could well furnish several billionsof horse-power. It should be borne in mind that many Martian tasks in mechanicalengineering are much easier than the terrestrial, on account of the smaller massof the planet and lesser density, which, in the superficial layers, may beconsiderably below the mean. To a still greater degree this is true ofelectrical engineering. Taking into account the space encompassed by Mars, asystem of wireless transmission of energy, such as I have perfected, would bethere much more advantageously applied, for, under similar conditions, areceiving circuit would collect sixteen times as much energy as on the earth. The astonishing evidences furnished by Lowell are not only indicative oforganic life, but they make it appear very probable that Mars is stillpopulated; and furthermore, that its inhabitants are highly developedintelligent beings. Is there any other proof of such existence? I answer,emphatically, yes, prompted both by an instinct which has never yet deceived me,and observation. I refer to the strange electrical disturbances, the discoveryof which I announced six years ago. At that time I was only certain that theywere of planetary origin. Now, after mature thought and study, I have come tothe positive conclusion that they must emanate from Mars. Life, as a great philosopher has said, is but a continuous adjustment to theenvironment. Similar conditions must bring forth similar automata. We can haveno idea what a Martian might be like, but he certainly has sensitive organs,much as our own, responsive to external stimuli. The indications of theseinstruments must be real and true. A straight line, a geometrical figure, anumber, must convey to his mind a clear and definite conception. He ought tothink and reason like ourselves. If he breathes, eats and drinks, he is moved bymotives and desires not very different from our own. Such colossaltransformation as is observable on the face of Mars could not have been wroughtexcept by beings ages ahead of us in development. What wonder, then, if theyhave maps of this, our globe, as perfect as Professor Pickering’s photographs ofthe moon? What wonder if they are signaling to us? We are sufficiently advancedin electrical science to know that their task is much easier than ours. Thequestion is, can we transmit electrical energy to that immense distance? This Ithink myself competent to answer in the affirmative. N. Tesla Tuned Lightning English Mechanic and World of Science, March 8, 1907 I read with interest an article in the Sunday World of Jan. 20 on \"TunedLightning,\" described as a mysterious new energy, which is to turn every wheelon earth, and is supposed to have been recently discovered by the Danishinventors Waldemar Poulsen and P. O. Pederson. From other reports I have gathered that these gentlemen have so far confinedthemselves to the peaceful production of miniature bolts not many inches long,and I am wondering what an account of their prospective achievements would readlike if they had succeeded in obtaining, like myself, electrical discharges of100 ft., far surpassing lightning in some features of intensity and power. In view of their limited Jovian experience, the program outlined by theDanish engineers is rather extensive, Lord Armstrong’s vast resourcesnotwithstanding. Naturally enough, I shall look with interest to theirtelephoning across the Atlantic, supplying light and propelling airships withoutwires. Anch in suito pittore. (I, too, am a painter.) In the mean time it maynot be amiss to state here incidentally that all the essential processes of andappliances for the generation, transmission, transformation, distribution,storage, regulation, control, and economic utilization of \"tuned lightning\" havebeen patented by me, and that I have long since undertaken, and am sparing noeffort to render these advances instrumental in insuring the welfare, comfort,and convenience, primarily, of my fellow citizens. There is nothing remarkable in the demonstration reported to have been madebefore Sir William Preece and Prof. Sylvanus P. Thompson, nor is there anynovelty in the electrical devices employed. The lighting of arc lamps throughthe human body, the fusing of a piece of copper in mid-air, as described, aresimple experiments which by the use of my high-frequency transformers anystudent of electricity can readily perform. They teach nothing new, and have nobearing on wireless transmission, for the actions virtually cease at a distanceof a few feet from the source of vibratory energy. Years ago I gave exhibitionsof similar and other much more striking experiments with the same kind ofapparatus, many of which have been illustrated and explained in technicaljournals. The published records are open to inspection. Regardless of all that, the Danish inventors have not as yet offered theslightest proof that their expectations are realizable, and before advancingseriously the claim that an efficient wireless distribution of light and powerto great distances is possible, they should, at least, repeat those of myexperiments which have furnished this evidence. A scientific audience cannot help being impressed by a display of interestingphenomena, but the originality and significance of a demonstration such as thatreferred to can only be judged by an expert possessed of full knowledge andcapable of drawing correct conclusions. A novel effect, spectacular andsurprising, might be quite unimportant, while another, seemingly trifling, is ofthe greatest consequence. To illustrate, let me mention here two widely different experiments of mine.In one the body of a person was subjected to the rapidly-alternating pressure ofan electrical oscillator of two and a half million volts; in the other a smallincandescent lamp was lighted by means of a resonant circuit grounded on oneend, all the energy being drawn through the earth electrified from a distanttransmitter. The first presents a sight marvelous and unforgettable. One sees theexperimenter standing on a big sheet of fierce, blinding flame, his whole bodyenveloped in a mass of phosphorescent wriggling streamers like the tentacles ofan octopus. Bundles of light stick out from his spine. As he stretches out thearms, thus forcing the electric fluid outwardly, roaring tongues of fire leapfrom his fingertips. Objects in his vicinity bristle with rays, emit musicalnotes, glow, grow hot. He is the center of still more curious actions, which areinvisible. At each throb of the electric force myriads of minute projectiles areshot off from him with such velocities as to pass through the adjoining walls.He is in turn being violently bombarded by the surrounding air and dust. Heexperiences sensations which are indescribable. A layman, after witnessing this stupendous and incredible spectacle, willthink little of the second modest exhibit. But the expert will not be deceived.He realizes at once that the second experiment is ever so much more difficult toperform and immensely more consequential. He knows that to make the littlefilament glow, the entire surface of the planet, two hundred million squaremiles, must be strongly electrified. This calls for peculiar electricalactivities, hundreds of times greater than those involved in the lighting of anarc lamp through the human body. What impresses him most, however, is theknowledge that the little lamp will spring into the same brilliancy anywhere onthe globe, there being no appreciable diminution of the effect with the increaseof distance from the transmitter. This is a fact of overwhelming importance, pointing with certitude to thefinal and lasting solution of all the great social, industrial, financial,philanthropic, international, and other problems confronting humanity, asolution of which will be brought about by the complete annihilation of distancein the conveyance of intelligence, transport of bodies and materials, and thetransmission of the energy necessary to man’s existence. More light has beenthrown on this scientific truth lately through Prof. Slaby’s splendid andpath-breaking experiment in establishing perfect wireless telephone connectionbetween Naum and Berlin, Germany, a distance of twenty miles. With apparatusproperly organised such telephonic communication can be effected with the samefacility and precision at the greatest terrestrial distance. The discovery of the stationary terrestrial waves, showing that, despite itsvast extent, the entire planet can be thrown into resonant vibration like alittle tuning fork; that electrical oscillations suited to its physicalproperties and dimensions pass through it unimpeded, in strict obedience to asimple mathematical law, has proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the earth,considered as a channel for conveying electrical energy, even in such delicateand complex transmissions as human speech or musical composition, is infinitelysuperior to a wire or cable, however well designed. Very soon it will be possible to talk across an ocean as clearly anddistinctly as across a table. The first practical success, already forecast bySlaby’s convincing demonstration, will be the signal for revolutionaryimprovements which will take the world by storm. However great the success of the telephone, it is just beginning its evidenceof usefulness. Wireless transmission of speech will not only provide new butalso enormously extend existing facilities. This will be merely the forerunnerof ever so much more important development, which will proceed at a furious paceuntil, by the application of these same great principles, the power ofwaterfalls can be focused whenever desired; until the air is conquered, the soilfructified and embellished; until, in all departments of human life distance haslost its meaning, and even the immense gulf separating us from other worlds isbridged. Nikola Tesla Tesla’s Wireless Torpedo New York Times — March 20, 1907 To the Editor of The New York Times: A report in the Times of this Morning says that I have attained no practicalresults with my dirigible wireless torpedo. This statement should be qualified.I have constructed such machines, and shown them in operation on frequentoccasions. They have worked perfectly, and everybody who saw them was amazed attheir performance. It is true that my efforts to have this novel means for attack and defenseadopted by our Government have been unsuccessful, but this is no discredit to myinvention. I have spent years in fruitless endeavor before the world recognizedthe value of my rotating field discoveries which are now universally applied.The time is not yet ripe for the telautomatic art. If its possibilities wereappreciated the nations would not be building large battleships. Such a floatingfortress may be safe against an ordinary torpedo, but would be helpless in abattle with a machine which carries twenty tons of explosive, moves swiftlyunder water, and is controlled with precision by an operator beyond the range ofthe largest gun. As to projecting wave-energy to any particular region of the globe, I havegiven a clear description of the means in technical publications. Not only canthis be done by the use of my devices, but the spot at which the desired effectis to be produced can be calculated very closely, assuming the acceptedterrestrial measurements to be correct. This, of course, is not the case. Up tothis day we do not know a diameter of the globe within one thousand feet. Mywireless plant will enable me to determine it within fifty feet or less, when itwill be possible to rectify many geodetical data and make such calculations asthose referred to with greater accuracy. Nikola Tesla New York, March 19, 1907 Wireless on Railroads New York Times — March 26, 1907 To the Editor of The New York Times: No argument is needed to show that the railroads offer opportunities foradvantageous use of a practical wireless system. Without question, its widestfield of application is the conveyance to the trains of such general informationas is indispensable for keeping the traveler in touch with the world. In thenear future a telegraphic printer of news, a stock ticker, a telephone, andother kindred appliances will form parts of the regular wireless equipment of arailroad train. Success in this sphere is all the more certain, as the new isnot antagonistic, but, on the contrary, very helpful to the old. The technicaldifficulties are minimized by the employment of a transmitter the effectivenessof which is unimpaired by distance. In view of the great losses of life and property, improved safety devices on thecars are urgently needed. But upon careful investigation it will be found thatthe outlook in this direction is not very promising for the wireless art. In thefirst place the railroads are rapidly changing to electric motive power, and inall such cases the lines become available for the operation of all sorts ofsignaling apparatus, of which she telephone is by far the most important. Thisvaluable improvement is due to Prof. J. Paley, who introduced it in Germanyeight years ago. By enabling the engineer or conductor of any train to call upany other train or station along the track and obtain full and unmistakableinformation, the liability of collisions and other accidents will be greatlyreduced. Public opinion should compel the immediate adoption of this invention. Those roads which do not contemplate this transformation might avail themselvesof wireless transmission for similar purposes, but inasmuch as every train willrequire in addition to a complete outfit an expert operator, many roads mayprefer to use a wire, unless a wireless telephone can be offered to them. Nikola Tesla New York, March 25, 1907 Nikola Tesla Objects New York Times — May 2, 1907 To the Editor of The New York Times: I have been much surprised to read in The Times of Sunday, April 21, thatAdmiral H. N. Manney, U.S.N. attributes a well-known invention of mine, aprocess for the production of continuous electrical oscillations by means of theelectric arc and condenser, to Valentine Poulsen, the Danish engineer. Thisimprovement has been embodied by me in numerous forms of apparatus identifiedwith my name; and I have described it minutely in patents and scientificarticles. To quote but one of many references, I may mention my experimentallecture on \"Light and Other High-Frequency Phenomena,\" published under theauspices of the Franklin Association, for which both of these societies havedistinguished me. I share with Admiral Manney in the gratification that we are in the lead, andparticularly that wireless messages have been transmitted from Pensacola toPoint Lorne. Inasmuch, however, as this feat could not have been accomplishedexcept by the use of some of my own devices, it would have been a graceful acton his part to bring this feat to the attention of the wireless conference. Mytheory has always been that military men are superior to civilians in courtesy.I have not been discouraged by the refusal of our Government to adopt mywireless system six years ago, when I offered it, not by the unpleasant prospectof my passing through the experiences described by Mark Twain in his story ofthe beef contract, but I see no reason why I should be deprived of a well-earnedhonor and satisfaction. The Times has hurt me grievously; not by accusing me of commercialism, nor byits unkind editorial comments on those letters I wrote, in condemnation of mysystem of power transmission in the Subway. It is another injury, perhaps,unintentional, which I have felt most keenly. The editor of The Times may not have known that I am a student of appliedmathematics when he permitted a fellow student of mine to insinuate in The Timesof March 28 that I avail myself of inventions of others. I cannot permit suchideas to gain ground in this community, and, just to illuminate the situation, Ishall quote from the leading electrical paper, The London Electrician, referringto some wireless plants of Braun and Marconi: \"The spark occurs between balls inthe primary circuit of a Tesla coil. The air wire is in series with a Teslatransformer. The generating plant is virtually a Poldhu in miniature. EvidentlyBraun, like Marconi, has been converted to the high-potential methods introducedby Tesla.\" Needless to add that this substitution of the old, ineffectiveHertzian appliances for my own has not been authorized by me. My fellow-student can rest assured that I am scrupulously respecting therights of others. If I were not prompted to do so by a sense of fairness andpride I would be by the power I have of inventing anything I please. N. Tesla New York, April 30, 1907 Mr. Tesla on the Wireless Transmission of Power N. Y. World May 19, 1907 To the Editor of The World: I have enjoyed very much the odd prediction of Sir Hugh Bell, President ofthe Iron and Steel Institute, with reference to the wireless transmission ofpower, reported in The World of the 10th inst. With all the respect due to that great institution I would take the libertyto remark that if its President is a genuine prophet he must have overslepthimself a trifle. Sir Hugh would honor me if he would carefully peruse myBritish patent No. 8,200, in which I have recorded some of my discoveries andexperiments, and which may influence him to considerably reduce his conservativeestimate of one hundred years for the fulfillment of his prophecy. Personally, basing myself on the knowledge of this art to which I havedevoted my best energies, I do not hesitate to state here for future referenceand as a test of accuracy of my scientific forecast that flying machines andships propelled by electricity transmitted without wire will have ceased to be awonder in ten years from now. I would say five were it not that there is such athing as \"inertia of human opinion\" resisting revolutionary ideas. It is idle to believe that because man is endowed with higher attributes hismaterial evolution is governed by other than general physical laws. If thegenius of invention were to reveal to-morrow the secret of immortality, ofeternal beauty and youth, for which all humanity is aching, the same inexorableagents which prevent a mass from changing suddenly its velocity would likewiseresist the force of the new knowledge until time gradually modifies humanthought. What has amused me still more, however, is the curious interview with LewisNixon, the naval contractor, printed in the World of the 11th inst. Is itpossible that the famous designer of the Oregon is not better versed ineditorial matters than some of my farming neighbors of Shoreham? One cannotescape that conviction. We are not in the dark as regards the electrical energy contained in theearth. It is altogether too insignificant for any industrial use. The currentcirculating through the globe is of enormous volume but of small tension, andcould perform but little work. Beside, how does Nixon propose to coax thecurrent from the natural path of low resistance into an artificial channel ofhigh resistance? Surely he knows that water does not flow up hill. It is absurdof him to compare the inexhaustible dynamic energy of wind with the magneticenergy of the earth, which is minute in amount and in a static condition. The torpedo he proposes to build is not novel. The principle is old. I couldrefer him to some of my own suggestions of nine years ago. There are manypractical difficulties in the carrying out of the idea, and as much better meansfor destroying a submarine are available it is doubtful that such a torpedo willever be constructed. Nixon has failed to grasp that in my wireless system the effect does notdiminish with distance. The Hertz waves have nothing to do with it except thatsome of my apparatus may be used in their production. So too a Kohinoor might beemployed to cut window-glass. And yet, the seeming paradox can be easilyunderstood by any man of ordinary intelligence. Imagine only that the earth were a hollow shell or reservoir in which thetransmitter would compress some fluid, as air, for operating machinery invarious localities. What difference would it make when this reservoir is tappedto supply the compressed fluid to the motor? None whatever, for the pressure isthe same everywhere. This is also true of my electrical system, with allconsiderations in its favor. In such a mechanical system of power distributiongreat losses are unavoidable and definite limits in the quality of the energytransmitted exist. Not so in the electrical wireless supply. It would not bedifficult to convey to one of our liners, say, 50,000 horsepower from a plantlocated at Niagara, Victoria or other waterfall, absolutely irrespective oflocation. In fact, there would not be a difference of more than a small fractionof one per cent, whether the source of energy be in the vicinity of the vesselor 12,000 miles away, at the antipodes. Nikola Tesla New York, May 16, 1907. Can Bridge the Gap to Mars New York Times — June 23, 1907 To the Editor of the New York Times: You have called me an \"inventor of some useful pieces of electricalapparatus.\" It is not quite up to my aspirations, but I must resign myself to myprosaic fate. I cannot deny that you are right. Nearly four million horse power of waterfalls are harnessed by my alternatingcurrent system of transmission, which is like saying that one hundred millionmen untiring, consuming nothing, receiving no pay - are laboring to provide forone hundred million tons of coal annually. In this great city the elevatedroads, the subways, the Street railways are operated by my system, and the lampsand other electrical appliances get the current through machinery of myinvention. And as in New York so all the world over where electricity isintroduced. The telephone and incandescent lamp fill specific and minor demands,electric power meets the many general and sterner necessities of life. Yes, Imust admit, however reluctantly, the truth of your unflattering contention. But the greater commercial importance of this invention of mine is not theonly advantage I have over my celebrated predecessors in the realm of theuseful, who have given us the telephone and the incandescent lamp. Permit me toremind you that I did not have, like Bell, such powerful help as the Reistelephone, which reproduced music and only needed a deft turn of an adjustingscrew to repeat the human voice; or such vigorous assistance as Edison found inthe incandescent lamps of King and Starr, which only needed to be made of highresistance. Not at all. I had to cut the path myself, and my hands are stillsore. All the army of my opponents and detractors was ever able to drum upagainst me in a fanatic contest has simmered down to a short article by anItalian - Prof. Ferraris - dealing with an abstract and meaningless idea of arotating magnetic pole and published years after my discovery, months even aftermy complete disclosure of the whole practically developed system in all itsessential universally adopted features. It is a publication, pessimistic anddiscouraging, devoid of the discoverer’s virility and force, devoid of results,utterly wanting in the faith and devotion of the inventor, a defective andbelated record of a good but feeble man whose only response to my whole-soledbrother greeting was a plaintive cry of priority - a sad contrast to the strongand equanimous Schallenberger, a true American engineer, who stoically bore thepain that killed him. A fundamental discovery or original invention is always useful, but it isoften more than that. There are physicists and philosophers to whom themarvelous manifestations of my rotating magnetic field, the suggestive phenomenaof rotation without visible connection, the ideal beauty of my induction motorwith its contactless armature, mean quite as much as the thousands of millionsof dollars invested in enterprises of which it is the foundation. And this is true of all my discoveries, inventions, and scientific resultswhich I have since announced, for I have never invented what immediate necessitysuggested, but what I found as most desirable to invent, irrespective of time.Let me tell you only of one - my \"magnifying transmitter,\" a machine with whichI have passed a current of one hundred amperes around the globe, with which Ican make the whole earth loudly repeat a word spoken in the telephone, withwhich I can easily bridge the gulf which separates us from Mars. Do you mean tosay that my transmitter is nothing more than a \"useful piece of electricalapparatus\"? I do not wish to enlarge on this for obvious reasons. To be compelled bytaciturn admirers to dwell on my own achievements is hurting my delicatesensibilities, but as I observe your heroic and increasing efforts in praisingyour paper, while your distinguished confreres maintain on its merits a stolidsilence, I feel that there is, at least, one man in New York able to appreciatethe incongeniality of the correspondence. Allow me to ask you just one or twoquestions in regard to a work which I began in 1892, inspired by a high tributefrom Lord Rayleigh at the Royal Institution, most difficult labor which I havecarried on for years, encouraged by the sympathetic interest and approval ofHemholtz, Lord Kelvin, and my great friends, Sir William Crookes and Sir JamesDewar, ridiculed by small men whose names I have seen displayed in vulgar anddeceptive advertisements. I refer to my system of wireless transmission ofenergy. The principles which it involves are eternal. We are on a conducting body,insulated in space, of definite and unchangeable dimensions and properties. Itwill never be possible to transmit electrical energy economically through thisbody and its environment except by essentially the same means and methods whichI have discovered, and the system is so perfect now that it admits of but littleimprovement. Since I have accepted as true your opinion, which I hope will notbe shared by posterity, would you mind telling a reason why this advance shouldnot stand worthily beside the discoveries of Copernicus? Will you state why itshould not be ever so much more important and valuable to the progress andwelfare of man? We could still believe in the geocentric theory and yet advance virtually aswe do. The work of the astronomer would suffer, for some of his deductions wouldrest on erroneous assumptions. But, after all, we shall never know the intimatenature of things. So long as our perceptions are accurate our logic will betrue. No one can estimate to what an extent the great knowledge he conveyed hasbeen instrumental in developing the power of our minds and furthering discoveryand invention. Yet, it has left all the pressing material problems confrontingus unsolved. Now my wireless system offers practical solutions for all. The aerialnavigation, which now agitates the minds, is only one of its many and obviousapplications equally consequential. The waterfalls of this country alone, itsgreatest wealth, are adequate to satisfy the wants of humanity for thousands ofyears to come. Their energy can be used with the same facility to dig the PanamaCanal as to operate the Siberian Railway or to irrigate and fertilize theSahara. The Anglo-Saxon race has a great past and present, but its realgreatness is in the future, when the water power it owns or controls shallsupply the necessities of the entire world. As to universal peace - if there is nothing in the order of nature whichmakes war indispensable to the safe and sane progress of man, if that utopianexistence is at all possible, it can be only attained through this very means,for all international friction can be traced to but one cause - the immenseextension of the planet. My system of wireless transmission completelyannihilates distance in all departments of human activity. If this does not appeal to you sufficiently to recognize in me a discovererof principles, do me, at least, the justice of calling me an \"inventor of somebeautiful pieces of electrical apparatus.\" Nikola Tesla New York, June 21, 1907 Sleep From Electricity New York Times — Oct. 19, 1907 To the Editor of The New York Times: I have read with interest the reports in The Times of the 13th and 15th inst.referring to Prof. Leduc’s discovery of causing sleep by electric means. Whileit is possible that he has made a distinct advance there is no novelty in theeffect itself. The narcotic influence of certain periodic currents was long ago discoveredby me and has been pointed out in some of my technical publications, among whichI may mention a paper on \"High Frequency Oscillators for Electro Therapeutic andOther Purposes,\" read before the American Electro Therapeutic Association, Sept.13, 1898. I have also shown that human tissues offer little resistance to theelectric flow and suggested an absolutely painless method of electrocution bypassing the currents through the brain. It is very likely that Prof. Leduc hastaken advantage of the same general principles though he applies the currents ina different manner. In one respect, however, my observations are at variance with those reported.From the special dispatch in The Times of the 13th inst. it would appear thatsleep is induced the moment the currents are turned on, and that awakeningfollows as soon as the electrodes are withdrawn. It is, of course, impossible totell how strong a current was employed, but the resistance of the head mighthave been, perhaps, 3,000 ohms, so that at thirty volts the current could havebeen only about 1-100 of an ampere. Now, I have passed a current of at least5,000 times stronger through my head and did not lose consciousness, but Iinvariably fell into a lethargic sleep some time after. This fact impresses mewith certain arguments of Prof. Barker of Columbia University in your issue ofSept. 15. I have always been convinced that electric anaesthesia will become practical,but the application of currents to the brain is so delicate and dangerous anoperation that the new method will require long ark careful experimentationbefore it ,can be used with certitude. Nikola Tesla New York, Oct. 16, 1907 Possibilities of \"Wireless\" New York Times — Oct. 22, 1907 To the Editor of The New York Times: In your issue of the 19th inst. Edison makes statements which cannot fail tocreate erroneous impressions. There is a vast difference between primitive Hertzwave signaling, practicableto but a few miles, and the great art of wireless transmission of energy, whichenables an expert to transmit, to any distance, not only signals, but power inunlimited amounts, and of which the experiments across the Atlantic are a crudeapplication. The plants are quite inefficient, unsuitable for finer work, andtotally doomed to an effect less than one percent of that I attained in my testin 1899. Edison thinks that Sir Hiram Maxim is blowing hot air. The fact is my LongIsland plant will transmit almost its entire energy to the antipodes, ifdesired. As to Martin’s communication I can only say, that I shall be able toattain a wave activity of 800,000,000 horse power and a simple calculation willshow, that the inhabitants of that planet, if there be any, need not have a LordRaleigh to detect the disturbance. Referring to your editorial comment of even date, the question of wirelessinterference is puzzling only because of its novelty. The underlying principleis old, and it has presented itself for consideration in numerous forms. Justnow it appears in the novel aspects of aerial navigation and wirelesstransmission. Every human effort must of necessity create a disturbance. Whatdifference is there in essence, between the commotion produced by anyrevolutionary idea or improvement and that of a wireless transmitter? Thespecter of interference has been conjured by Hertzwave or radio telegraphy inwhich attunement is absolutely impossible, simply because the effect diminishesrapidly with distance. But to my system of energy transmission, based on the useof impulses not sensibly diminishing with distance, perfect attunement and thehigher artifice of individualization are practicable. As ever, the ghost willvanish with the wireless dawn. Nikola Tesla New York, Oct. 21, 1907. Tesla on Wireless New York Daily Tribune — Oct. 25, 1907 To the Editor of The Tribune: Sir: In so far as wireless art is concerned there is a vast differencebetween the great inventor Thomas A. Edison and myself, integrally in my favor.Mr. Edison knows little of the theory and practice of electrical vibrations; Ihave, in this special field, probably more experience than any of mycontemporaries. That you are not as yet able to impart your wisdom by wirelesstelephone to some subscriber in any other part of the world, however remote, andthat the presses of your valuable paper are not operated by wireless power islargely due to your own effort and those of some of your distinguished confreresof this city, and to the efficient assistance you have received from mycelebrated colleagues, Thomas A. Edison and Michael Pupin, assistant consultingwireless engineers. But it was all welcome to me. Difficulty develops resource. The transmission across the Atlantic was not made by any device of Mr.Marconi’s, but by my system of wireless transmission of energy, and I havealready given notice by cable to my friend Sir James DeWar and the RoyalInstitution of this fact. I shall also request some eminent man of science totake careful note of the whole apparatus, its mode of operation, dimensions,linear and electrical, all constants and qualitative performance, so as to makepossible its exact reproduction and repetition of the experiments. This requestis entirely impersonal. I am a citizen of the United States, and I know that thetime will come when my busy fellow citizens, too absorbed in commercial pursuitsto think of posterity, will honor my memory. A measurement of the time intervaltaken in the passage of the signal necessary to the full and positivedemonstration will show that the current crosses the ocean with a mean speed of625,000 miles a second. The Marconi plants are inefficient, and do not lend themselves to thepractice of two discoveries of mine, the \"art of individualization,\" that makesthe message non-interfering and non-interferable, and the \"stationary waves,\"which annihilate distance absolutely and make the whole earth equivalent to aconductor devoid of resistance. Were it not for this deficiency, the number ofwords per minute could be increased at will by \"individualizing.\" You have already commented upon this advance in terms which have caused me nosmall astonishment, in view of your normal attitude. The underlying principle isto combine a number of vibrations, preferably slightly displaced, to reducefurther the danger of interference, active and passive, and to make theoperation of the receiver dependent on the co-operative effect of a number ofattuned elements. Just to illustrate what can be done, suppose that only fourvibrations were isolated on each transmitter. let those on one side berespectively a, b, c, and d. Then the following individualized lines would beab, ac, ad, bc, bd, cd, abc, abd, acd, bed and abed. The same article on theother side will give similar combinations, and both together twenty-two lines,which can be simultaneously operated. To transmit one thousand words a minute,only forty-six words on each combination are necessary. If the plants weresuitable, not ten years, as Edison thinks, but ten hours would be necessary toput this improvement into practice. To do this Marconi would have to constructthe plants, and it will then be observed that the indefatigable Italian hasdeparted from universal engineering customs for the fourth time. Nikola Tesla New York, Oct. 24, 1907 My Apparatus, Says Tesla New York Times — Dec. 20, 1907 To the Editor of the New York Times: I have read with great interest the report in your issue of to-day that theDanish engineer, Waldemar Poulson, the inventor of the interesting device knownas the \"telegraphone,\" has succeeded in transmitting accurately wirelesstelephonic messages over a distance of 240 miles. I have looked up the description of the apparatus he has employed in theexperiment and find that it comprises: (1) My grounded resonant transmitting circuit; (2) my inductive exciter; (3) the so-called \"Tesla transformer\"; (4) my inductive coils for raising the tension on the condenser; (5) my entire apparatus for producing undamped or continuous oscillations; (6) my concatenated tuned transforming circuits; (7) my grounded resonant receiving transformer; (8) my secondary receiving transformer. I note other improvements of mine, but those mentioned will be sufficient toshow that Denmark is a land of easy invention. The claim that transatlantic wireless telephone service will soon beestablished by these means is a modest one. To my system distance has absolutelyno significance. My own wireless plant will transmit speech across the Pacificwith the same precision and accuracy as across the table. Nikola Tesla New York, Dec. 19, 1907 Nikola Tesla’s Forecast for 1908 N. Y. World — Jan. 5, 1908 To the Editor of The World: Constant and careful study of the state of things in this particular sphereenables an expert to make a forecast fairly accurate of the next state. Theseemingly isolated events are to him but links of a chain. As a rule, the signshe notes are so pronounced that he can predict the changes about to take placewith certitude. The performance is a mere banality as compared with the piercingview of the inspired into the distant future. This is a forecast - not aprophecy. The coming year will be great in thought and result. It will mark the end ofa number of erroneous ideas which, by their paralyzing effect on the mind, havethrottled independent research and hampered progress and development in variousdepartments of science and engineering. The first to be dispelled is the illusion of the Hertz or electro-magneticwaves. The expert already realizes that practical wireless telegraphy andtelephony are possible only by minimizing this wasteful radiation. The resultsrecently attained in this manner with comparatively crude appliances illustratestrikingly the possibilities of the genuine art. Before the close of the yearwireless transmission across the Pacific and trans-Atlantic wireless telephonymay be expected with perfect confidence. The use of the wireless telephone inisolated districts will spread like fire. The year will mark the fall of the illusionary idea that action must diminishwith distance. By impressing upon the earth certain vibrations to which itresponds resonantly, the whole planet is virtually reduced to the size of alittle marble, thus enabling the reproduction of any kind of effect, as humanspeech, music, picture or character whatever, and even the transmission of powerin unlimited amounts with exactly the same facility and economy at any distance,however great. The next twelve months will witness a similar revolution of ideas regardingradio-activity. That there is no such element as radium, polonium or ronium isbecoming more and more evident. These are simply deceptive appearances of amodern phlogiston. As I have stated in my early announcement of these emanationsbefore the discovery of Mme. Curie, they are emitted more or less by all bodies,and are all of the same kind - merely effects of shattered molecules,differentiated not by the nature of substance but by size, speed andelectrification. The coming year will dispel another error which has greatly retarded progressof aerial navigation. The aeronaut will soon satisfy himself that an airplaneproportioned according to data obtained by Langley is altogether too heavy tosoar, and that such a machine, while it will have some uses, can never fly asfast as a dirigible balloon. Once this is fully recognized the expert willconcentrate his efforts on the latter type, and before many months are passed itwill be a familiar object in the sky. There is abundant evidence that distinct improvements will be made in shippropulsion. The numerous theories are giving place to the view that what propelsthe vessel is a reactive jet; hence the propeller is doomed in efficiency athigh speed. A new principle will be introduced. The World is invited to test the accuracy of this forecast at the close ofthe year. Nikola Tesla Mr. Tesla’s Vision New York Times — April 21, 1908 To the Editor of the New York Times: From a report in your issue of March 11, which escaped my attention, I noticethat some remarks I made on the occasion referred to have been misunderstood.Allow me to make a correction.. When I spoke of future warfare I meant that it should be conducted by directapplication of electrical waves without the use of aerial engines or otherimplements of destruction. This means, as I pointed out, would be ideal, for notonly would the energy of war require no effort for the maintenance of itspotentiality, but it would be productive in times of peace. This is not a dream.Even now wireless power plants could be constructed by which any region of theglobe might be rendered uninhabitable without subjecting the population of otherparts to serious danger or inconvenience. What I said in regard to the greatest achievement of the man of science whosemind is bent upon the mastery of the physical universe, was nothing more thanwhat I stated in one of my unpublished addresses, from which I quote: \"Accordingto an adopted theory, every ponderable atom is differentiated from a tenuousfluid, filling all space merely by spinning motion, as a whirl of water in acalm lake. By being set in movement this fluid, the ether, becomes gross matter.Its movement arrested, the primary substance reverts to its normal state. Itappears, then, possible for man through harnessed energy of the medium andsuitable agencies for starting and stopping ether whirls to cause matter to formand disappear, At his command, almost without effort on his part, old worldswould vanish and new ones would spring into being. He could alter the size ofthis planet, control its seasons, adjust its distance from the sun, guide it onits eternal journey along any path he might choose, through the depths of theuniverse. He could make planets collide and produce his suns and stars, his heatand light; he could originate life in all its infinite forms. To cause at willthe birth and death of matter would be man’s grandest deed, which would give himthe mastery of physical creation, make him fulfill his ultimate destiny.\" Nothing could be further from my thought than to call wireless telephonyaround the world \"the greatest achievement of humanity\" as reported. This is afeat which, however stupefying, can be readily performed by any expert. I havemyself constructed a plant for this very purpose. The wireless wonders are onlyseeming, not results of exceptional skill, as popularly believed. The truth isthe electrician has been put in possession of a veritable lamp of Aladdin. Allhe has to do is to rub it. Now, to rub the lamp of Aladdin is no achievement, If you are desirous of hastening the accomplishment of still greater andfurther - reaching wonders you can do no better than by emphatically opposingany measure tending to interfere with the free commercial exploitation of waterpower and the wireless art. So absolutely does human progress depend on thedevelopment of these that the smallest impediment, particularly through thelegislative bodies of this country, may set back civilization and the cause ofpeace for centuries. Nikola Tesla New York, April 19, 1908 Little Airplane Progress New York Times — June 8 To the Editor of the New York Times: It was not a little amusing to read a short time ago how the \"great secret\"of the airplane was revealed. By surrounding that old device with an atmosphereof mystery one gives life and interest to the report; but the plain fact is thatall forms of aerial apparatus are well known to engineers, and can be designedfor any specific duty without previous trials and with a fair degree ofaccuracy. The flying machine has materialized - not through leaps and bounds ofinvention, but by progress slow and imperceptible, not through originalindividual effort, but by a combination of the same forces which brought forththe automobile, and the motorboat. It is due to the enterprise of the steel,oil, electrical, and other concerns, who have been instrumental in theimprovement of materials of construction and in the production of high-powerfuels, as well as to the untiring labors of the army of skilled but unknownmechanics, who have been for years perfecting the internal combustion engine. There is no salient difference between the dirigible balloon of Renard andKrebs of thirty years ago and that of Santos Oumont with which the boldBrazilian performed his feats. The Langley and Maxim aerodromes, which did notsoar, were in my opinion better pieces of mechanism than their very latestimitations. The powerful gasoline motor which has since come into existence ispractically the only radical improvement. So far, however, only the self-propelled machine or aerial automobile is insight. While the dirigible balloon is rapidly nearing the commercial stage,nothing practical has as yet been achieved with the heavier-than-air machine.Without exception the apparatus is flimsy and unreliable. The motor, too lightfor its power, gives out after a few minutes run; the propeller blades fly off;the rudder is broken, and, after a series of such familiar mishaps, there comesthe inevitable and general smash-up. In strong contrast with these unnecessarilyhazardous trials are the serious and dignified efforts of Count Zeppelin, who isbuilding a real flying machine, safe and reliable, to carry a dozen men andprovisions over distances of thousands of miles, and with a speed far in excessof those obtained with airplanes. The limits of improvement in the flying machine, propelled by its own power,whether light or heavy, are already clearly defined. We know very closely whatwe may expect from the ultimate perfection of the internal combustion engine,the remittances which are to be overcome, and the limitations of the screwpropeller. The margin is not very great. For many reasons the wirelesstransmission of power is the only perfect and lasting solution to reach veryhigh speeds. In this respect many experts are mistaken. The popular belief that becausethe air has only one-hundredth the density of water, enormous velocities shouldbe practicable. But it is not so. It should be borne in mind that the air is onehundred times more viscous than water, and because of this alone the speed ofthe flying machine could not be much in excess of a properly designed aqueouscraft. The airplanes of the Langley type, such as was used by Forman and others withsome success, will hardly ever prove a practical aerial machine, because noprovision is made for maintaining it in the air in a downward current. This andthe perfect balance independently of the navigator’s control is absolutelyessential to the success of the heavier-than-air machine. These two improvementsI am myself endeavoring to embody in a machine of my own design. Nikola Tesla New York, June 6, 1908 Tesla on Airplanes New York Times — Sept. 15 To the Editor of The New York Times: The chronicler of current events is only too apt to lose sight of the trueperspective and real significance of the phases of progress he records.Naturally enough, his opinions on subjects out of the sphere of his specialtraining are frequently defective, but this is inseparable from the very idea ofjournalism. If an editor were to project himself into the future and view thehappenings of the present or of the past in their proper relations he would makea dismal failure of his paper. The comments upon the latest performances with airplanes afford interestingexamples in this respect. What is there so very different between a man flyinghalf an hour and another, using a more powerful machine, an hour, or two, orthree? To be sure, in one instance the supporting planes are larger and thegasoline tank bigger, but there is nothing revolutionary in these departures. Noone can deny the merit of the accomplishments. The feats are certainlyremarkable and of great educational value. The majority of human beings are unreceptive to novel ideas. The practicaldemonstrator comes with forceful arguments which enlighten and convince. Butthey are nothing more than obvious consequences of what has preceded, steps inadvance which, taken singly, are of no particular importance, but which, intheir totality, make up the conquest of the world by the new idea. If any onestands out more strongly than the other it is merely because it chances to occurat the psychological moment, when incredulity and doubt are giving way toconfidence and expectancy. Such work is often brilliant, never great, as somewould make believe. To be great it must be original. Of such feature it isabsolutely devoid. Place any of the later airplanes beside that of Langley, their prototype, andyou will not find as much as one decided improvement. There are the same oldpropellers, the same old inclined planes, rudders, and vanes - not a singlenotable difference. Some have tried to hide their \"discoveries.\" It is like thehiding of an ostrich who buries his head in the sand. Half a dozen aeronautshave been in turn hailed as conquerors and kings of the air. It would have beenmuch more appropriate to greet John D. Rockefeller as such. But for the abundantsupply of high-grade fuel we would still have to wait for an engine capable ofsupporting not only itself but several times its own weight against gravity. The capabilities of the Langley aerodrome have been most strikinglyillustrated. Notwithstanding this, it is not a practical machine. It has a lowefficiency of propulsion, and the starting, balancing, and alighting areattended with difficulties. The chief defect, however, is that it is doomed ifit should encounter a downward gust of wind. The helicopter is in these respectsmuch preferable, but is objectionable for other reasons. The successfulheavier-than-air flier will be based on principles radically novel and will meetall requirements. It will soon materialize, and when it does it will give animpetus to manufacture and commerce such as was never witnessed before, providedonly that the Governments do not resort to the methods of the SpanishInquisition, which have already proved so disastrous to the wireless art, theideal means for making man absolute master of the air. Nikola Tesla New York, Sept. 13, 1908 How to Signal Mars New York Times — May 23 To the Editor of the New York Times: Of all the evidence of narrow mindedness and folly, I know of no greater thanthe stupid belief that this little planet is singled out to be the seat of life,and that all other heavenly bodies are fiery masses or lumps of ice. Mostcertainly, some planets are not inhabited, but others are, and among these theremust exist II life under all conditions and phases of development. I In the solar system Venus, the Earth, and Mars represent respectively,youth, full growth, and old age. Venus, with its mountains rising dozens ofmiles into the atmosphere, is probably as yet unfitted for such existence asours, but Mars must have passed through all terrestrial states and conditions. Civilized existence rests on the development of the mechanical arts. Theforce of gravitation on Mars is only two-thirds of that on earth, hence allmechanical problems must have been much easier of solution. This is even more soof the electrical. The planet being much smaller, the contact betweenindividuals and the mutual exchange of ideas must have been much quicker, andthere are many other reasons why intellectual life should have been on thatplanet, phenomenal in its evolution. To be sure, we have no absolute proof that Mars is inhabited. Thestraightness of the canals, which has been held out as a convincing indicationto this effect, is not at all such. We can conclude with mathematical certitudethat as a planet grows older and the mountains are leveled down, ultimatelyevery river must flow in a geodetically straight line. Such straightening isalready noticeable in some rivers of the earth. But the whole arrangement of the so-called waterways, as pictured by Lowell,would seem to have been designed. Personally I base my faith on the feebleplanetary electrical disturbances which I discovered in the summer of 1899, andwhich, according to my investigations, could not have originated from the sun,the moon, or Venus. Further study since has satisfied me that they must haveemanated from Mars. All doubt in this regard will be soon dispelled. To bring forth arguments why an attempt should be made to establishinterplanetary communication would be a useless and ungrateful undertaking. Ifwe had no other reason, it would be justified by the universal interest which itwill command, and by the inspiring hopes and expectations to which it would giverise. I shall rather concentrate my efforts upon the examination of the plansproposed and the description of a method by which this seemingly impossible taskcan be readily accomplished. The scheme of signaling by rays of light is old, and has been oftendiscussed, perhaps, more by that eloquent and picturesque Frenchman, CamilleFlammarion, than anybody else. Quite recently Prof. W. H. Pickering, as statedin several issues of the New York Times, has made a suggestion which deservescareful examination. The total solar radiation falling on a terrestrial area perpendicular to therays amounts to eighty-three foot pounds per square foot per second. Thisactivity measured by the adopted standard is a little over fifteenone-thousandth of a horsepower. But only about 10 per cent of this whole is dueto waves of light. These, however, are of widely different lengths, making itimpossible to use all in the best advantage, and there are specific lossesunavoidable in the use of mirrors, so that the power of sunlight reflected fromthem can scarcely exceed 5.5 foot pounds per square foot per second, or aboutone one-hundredth of a horse-power. In view of this small activity, a reflecting surface of at least one-quartermillion square feet should be provided for the experiment. This area, of course,should be circular to insure the greatest efficiency, and, with due regard toeconomy, it should be made up of mirrors rather small, such as to meet best therequirements of cheap manufacture. The idea has been advanced by some experts that a small reflector would be asefficient as a large one. This is true in a degree, but holds good only inheliographic transmission to small distances when the area covered by thereflected beam is not vastly in excess of that of the mirror. In signaling toMars, the effect would be exactly proportionate to the aggregate surface of thereflections. With an area of one-quarter million square feet the activity of thereflected sunlight, at the origin would be about 2,500 horse-power. It scarcely need be stated that these mirrors would have to be ground andpolished most carefully. To use ordinary commercial plates, as has beensuggested, would be entirely out of the question, for at such an immensedistance the imperfections of surface would fatally interfere with efficiency.Furthermore, expensive clock work would have to be employed to rotate thereflectors in the manner of heliostats, and provision would have to be made forprotection against destructive atmospheric influence. It is extremely doubtfulthat so formidable an array of apparatus could be produced for $10,000,000, butthis is a consideration of minor importance to this argument. If the reflected rays were paralled and the heavenly bodies devoid ofatmospheres, nothing would be simpler than signaling to Mars, for it is a truthaccepted by physicists that a bundle of parallel rays, in vacuum, wouldilluminated an area with the same intensity, whether it be near or infinitelyremote. In other words, there is no sensible loss in the transportation ofradiant energy through interplanetary or vacuous space. This being the case,could we but penetrate the prison wall of the’ atmosphere, we could clearlyperceive the smallest object on the most distant star, so inconceivably tenuous,frictionless, rigid, and elastic is the medium pervading the universe. The sun’s rays are usually considered to be parallel, and are virtually sothrough a short trajectory, because of the immense distance of the luminary. Butthe radiations, coming from a distance of 93,000,000 miles, emanate from asphere 865,000 miles in diameter, and, consequently, most of them will fall. onthe mirrors at an angle less than 90 degrees, with the result of causing acorresponding divergence of the reflected rays. Owing to the equality of theangles of incidence and reflection, it follows that if Mars were at half thesun’s distance, the rays reaching the planet would cover an area of aboutone-quarter of that of the solar disc, or in round numbers, 147,000,000,000square miles, which is nearly 16,400,000, 000 times larger than that of themirrors. This means that the intensity of the radiation received on Mars wouldbe just that many times smaller. To convey a definite idea, it may be stated that the light we get from themoon is 600,000 times feebler than that of the sun. Accordingly, even underthese purely theoretical conditions the Pickering apparatus could do no morethan produce an illumination 27,400,000 times feebler. than that of the fullmoon, or 1,000 times weaker than that of Venus. The proceeding is based on the assumption that there is nothing in the pathof the reflected rays except the tenuous medium filling all space. But theplanets have atmospheres which absorb and refract. We see remote objects lessdistinctly, we perceive stars long after they have fallen below the horizon.This is due to absorption and refraction of the rays passing through the air.While these effects cannot be exactly estimated it is certain that theatmosphere is the chief impediment to the study of the heavens. By locating our observatories one mile above sea level the quantity of matterwhich the rays have to traverse on their way to the planet is reduced toone-third. But, as the air becomes less dense, there is comparatively littlegain to be derived from greater elevation. What chance would there be that thereflected rays, reduced to an intensity far below that estimated above, wouldproduce a visible signal on Mars? Though I do not deny this possibility, allevidence points to the contrary. Lowell, a trained and restless observer, who has made the study of Mars hisspecialty, and is working under ideal conditions, has been so far unable toperceive a light effect of the magnitude such as the proposed signalingapparatus might produce there. Phobos, the smaller of the two satellites of Mars- from seven to 10 miles in diameter - can only be seen at short intervals whenthe planet is in opposition. The satellite presents to us an area ofapproximately fifty square miles, reflecting sunlight at least as well asordinary earth, which has little over one-twelfth of the power of a mirror. Stated otherwise, an equivalent effect at that distance would be produced bymirrors covering four square miles, which means two square miles of the samereflectors if located on earth, as it receives sunlight of twice the intensity.Now this is an area 222 times larger than that of the ten million dollarreflector, and yet Phobos is hardly perceptible. It is true that the observationof the satellite is rendered difficult by the glare of its mother planet. Butthis is offset by the fact that it is in vacuum and that its rays suffer littlediminution through absorption and refraction of the earth’s atmosphere. What has been stated is thought sufficient to convince the reader that thereis little to be expected from the plan under discussion. The idea naturallypresents itself that mirrors might be manufactured which will reflect sunlightin parallel beams. For the time being this is a task beyond human power, but noone can set a limit to the future achievement of man. Still more ineffective would be the attempt of signaling in the mannerproposed by Dr. William R. Brooks and others, by artificial light, as theelectric arc. In order to obtain a reflected light activity of 2,500 horsepowerit would be necessary to install a power plant of not less than 75,000horsepower, which, with its turbines, dynamos, parabolic reflectors and otherparaphernalia, would probably cost more than $10,000,000. While this methodwould permit operation at favorable times, when the earth is nearer to, and hasits dark side turned toward Mars, it has the disadvantage of involving the useof reflected rays necessarily more divergent than those of the sun, it beingimpossible to construct mirrors of the required perfection and without their usethe rays would be scattered to such an extent that the effect would be muchsmaller. Reflecting surfaces of great extent can be had readily. Prof. R. W. Woodmakes the odd suggestion of using the white alkali desert of the southwest forthe purpose. Prof. E. Doolittle advises the employment of large geometricfigures. In my opinion none of these suggestions is feasible. The trouble is,that the earth itself is a reflector, not efficient, it is true, but what itlacks in this respect is more than made up by the immensity of its area. Toconvey a perceptible signal in this manner it might require as much as 100square miles reflecting surface But there is one method of putting ourselves in touch with other planets.Though not easy of execution, it is simple in principle. A circuit properlydesigned and arranged is connected with one of its ends to an insulated terminalat some height and with the other to earth. Inductively linked with it isanother circuit in which electrical oscillations of great intensity are set upby means now familiar to electricians. This combination of apparatus is known asmy wireless transmitter. By careful attunement of the circuits the expert can produce a vibration ofextraordinary power, but when certain artifices, which I have not yet describedare resorted to the oscillation reaches transcending intensity. By this means,as told in my published technical records, I have passed a powerful currentaround the globe and attained activities of many millions of horsepower.Assuming only a rate of 15,000,000, readily obtainable, it is 6,000 times morethan that produced by the Pickering’s mirrors. But, my method has other and still greater advantages. By its employment theelectrician on Mars, instead of utilizing the energy received by a few thousandsquare feet of area, as in a parabolic reflector, is enabled to concentrate inhis instrument the energy received by dozens of square miles, thus multiplyingthe effect many thousands of times. Nor is this all. By proper methods anddevices he can magnify the received effect as many times again. It is evident, then, that in my experiments in 1899 and 1900 I have alreadyproduced disturbances on Mars incomparably more powerful than could be attainedby any light reflectors, however large. Electrical science is now so far advanced that our ability of flashing asignal to a planet is experimentally demonstrated. The question is, when willhumanity witness that great triumph. This is readily answered. The moment weobtain absolute evidences that an intelligent effort is being made in some otherworld to this effect, interplanetary transmission of intelligence can beconsidered an accomplished fact. A primitive understanding can be reachedquickly without difficulty. A complete exchange of ideas is a greater problem,but susceptible of solution. Nikola Tesla What Science May Achieve this Year: New Mechanical Principle for Conservation ofEnergy Denver Rocky Mountain News — Jan. 16, 1910 The spread of civilization may be likened to that of fire: First, a feeblespark, next a flickering flame, then a mighty blaze, ever increasing in speedand power. We are now in this last phase of development. Human activity has become so widespread and intense that years count ascenturies of progress. There is no more groping in the dark or accidentallystumbling upon discoveries. The results follow one another like the links of achain. ‘Such is the force of the accumulated knowledge and the insight intonatural laws and phenomena that future events are clearly projected before ourvision. To foretell what is coming would be no more than to draw logicalconclusions, were it not for the difficulty in accurately fixing the time ofaccomplishment. The practical success of an idea, irrespective of its inherent merit, isdependent on the attitude of the contemporaries. If timely it is quicklyadopted; if not, it is apt to fare like a sprout lured out of the ground by warmsunshine, only to be injured and retarded in its growth by the succeeding frost.Another determining factor is the amount of change involved in its introduction.To meet with instant success an invention or discovery must come not only as arational, but a welcome solution. The year 1910 will mark the advent of such anidea. It is a new mechanical principle. Since the time of Archimedes certain elementary devices were known, whichwere finally reduced to two, the lever and the inclined plane. Another elementis to be added to these, which will give rise to new conceptions and profoundlyaffect both the practical and theoretical science of mechanics. This novel principle is capable of embodiment in all kinds of machinery. Itwill revolutionize the propulsion apparatus on vessels, the locomotive,passenger car and the automobile. It will give us a practical flying machineentirely different from those made heretofore in operation and control, swift,small and compact and so safe that a girl will be able to fly in it to schoolwithout the governess. But the greatest value of this improvement will be in itsapplication in a field virtually unexplored and so vast that it will takedecades before the ground is broken. It is the field of waste. We build but to tear down. Most of our work and resource is squandered. Ouronward march is marked by devastation. Everywhere there is an appalling loss oftime, effort and life. A cheerless view, but true. A single example out of manywill suffice for illustration. The energy necessary to our comfort and safe existence is largely derivedfrom coal. In this country alone nearly one million tons of the life-sustainingmaterial are daily extracted from the bowels of the earth with pain andsacrifice. This is about seven hundred tons per minute, representing atheoretical activity of, say, four hundred and fifty-million horsepower. Butonly a small percentage of this is usefully applied. In heating, most of the precious energy escapes through the flue. Thechimneys of New York City puff out into the air several million horsepower. Inthe use of coal for power purposes, we hardly capture more than 10 percent. Theexhaust of engines carries off more energy than obtained from live steam. In many modern plants the power has been actually doubled by obviating thiswaste, but the machinery employed is cumbersome and expensive. The manufactureof light is in a barbarous state of imperfection, and this may also be said ofmany industrial processes. Consider just one case, the manufacture of iron andsteel. America produces approximately 30,000,000 tons of pig iron per year. Each tonof iron requires about one and a half tons of coal, hence, in providing the ironmarket, 70,000,000 tons of coal per annum, or 133 tons per minute, are consumed.In the manufacture of coke a ton of coal yields, roughly, 10,000 cubic feet ofgas of a mean heating capacity of 600 heat units per cubic foot. Bearing in mind that 133 tons are used per minute, the total heat unitsdeveloped in that time would be 798,000,000, the mechanical equivalent of whichis about 19,000,000 horsepower. By the use of the new principle 7,000,000horsepower might be rendered available. A furnace of 200 tons producesapproximately 17,000 cubic feet of gas per minute of heat value of 100 units,corresponding to a theoretical performance of 40,000 horsepower, of which notless than 13,000 might be utilized in the improved apparatus referred to. Thepower derived by this method from all blast furnaces in the United States wouldbe considerably above 5,000,000 horsepower. The preceding figures, which are conservative, show that it would be possibleto obtain 12,000,000 horsepower merely from the waste gasses in the iron andsteel manufacture. The value of this power, fairly estimated, is $180,000,000per annum, and it must be made worth much more by systematic exploitation. A part of the power could be advantageously employed for operating theblowers, rollers and other indispensable machinery and supplying electricity forsmelting, steel making and other purposes. The bulk might be used in themanufacture of nitrates, aluminum, carbides and ice. The production of nitrateswould be particularly valuable from the point of view of national economy.Assuming that 5,000,000 horsepower were apportioned for that purpose, the annualyield would be not less than 10,000,000 tons of concentrated nitric compound,adequate to fertilizing 40, 000,000 acres of land. A great encouragement wouldbe given to agriculture and the condition of the steel and iron workersameliorated by offering to them a fertilizer at a reduced rate, thus enablingthem to cultivate their farms with exceptional profit. Other conveniences andnecessities, as light, power, ice and ozonized water could be similarly offeredand numerous other improvements, both to the advantage of capital and labor,carried out. To appreciate the above it should be borne in mind that the iron and steelindustry is one of the best regulated in the world. In many other fields thewaste is even greater. For example, in the operation of steam railroads, notless than 98 per cent of the total energy of coal burned is lost. An enormoussaving could be effected by replacing the present apparatus with new gasturbines and other improved devices for transmitting and storing mechanicalenergy. A study of this subject will convince that for the time being, at least,there is more opportunity for invention in the utilization of waste than in theopening up of new resources. N. Tesla Mr. Tesla on the Future Modern Electrics — May, 1912 On Tesla Day, at the Northwest Electric Show, held at Minneapolis, Minn., March16th to 23rd, Mr. Tesla sent, through Archbishop Ireland, the following messageto the people of the Twin Cities and the Northwest: New York, N. Y., March 18, 1912. His Grace, The Most Reverend ArchbishopIreland: I bespeak your Grace’s far-famed eloquence in voicing sentiments and ideasto which I can give but feeble expression. May the exposition prove a successbefitting the cities of magical growth, the courage and energy of westernenterprise, a credit to its organization, a lasting benefit to the communitiesand the world through its lessons and stimulating influence as a bewildering,unforgettable record of the triumphant progress of the art. Great as are thepast achievements, the future holds out more glorious promise. We are getting aninsight into the essence of things; our means and methods are being refined, anew and specialized race is developing with knowledge deep and precise, withgreater powers and keener perceptions. Mysterious as ever before, nature yieldsher precious secrets more readily and the spirit of man asserts its mastery overthe physical universe. The day is not distant when the very planet which gavehim birth will tremble at the sound of his voice; he will make the sun hisslave, harness the inexhaustible and terribly intense energy of microcosmicmovement; cause atoms to combine in predetermined forms; he will draw the mightyocean from its bed, transport it through the air and create lakes and rivers atwill; he will command the wild elements; he will push on and on from great togreater deeds until with his intelligence and force he will reach out to spheresbeyond the terrestrial. I am your Grace’s most obedient servant. Nikola Tesla Tesla and Marconi New York Sun — May 22 To the Editor of The Sun - Sir: The reports contained in The Sun and otherjournals regarding the issue of a recent wireless patent suit are of a nature tocreate an erroneous impression. Two of the patents mentioned, namely, Nos.11,9j3 and 609,154, granted respectively to William Marconi and Sir OliverLodge, are of no importance, but another patent of the former expert, dated June28, 1904, contains arrangements on which I obtained full protection more thanthree years before and which are essential to the successful practice of thewireless art at any considerable distance. My patents bear the numbers 645,576 and 649,621 and were secured throughKerr, Page & Cooper, attorneys for the General Electric and Westinghousecompanies. The apparatus described by me comprises four circuits peculiarlyarranged and carefully attuned so as to secure the greatest possible flow ofelectrical energy through them. The generator is a transformer of my inventionand the oscillations employed are of a kind which are now known in technicalliterature as the Tesla currents. Every one of these elements, even to the lastdetail, is contained in the Marconi patent which was involved in the suit, andits use constitutes an infringement of all the fundamental features of mywireless system. Nikola Tesla New York, March 21, 1914. Nikola Tesla Tells of Country’s War Problems New York Herald — April 15, 1917 The conquest of elements, annihilation of distance in the transmission offorce and numerous other revolutionary advances have brought us face to facewith problems new and unforeseen. To meet these is an imperative necessityrendered especially pressing through the struggle which is now being wagedbetween nations on a stupendous scale unprecedented in history. This country, finding it impossible to remain an inactive witness of medievalbarbarism and disregard of sacred rights, has taken up arms in a spirit broadand impartial and in the interest of humanity and peace. Its participation willbe absolutely decisive as regards the final result, but those who expect aspeedy termination of the conflict should undeceive themselves. War, however complex, is essentially a mechanical process, and, in conformitywith a universal principle, its duration must be proportionate to the masses setin motion. The truth of this law is borne out by previous records, from which itmay be calculated that, barring conditions entirely out of the ordinary, theperiod should be from five to six years. Great freedom of institutions, such as we are privileged to enjoy, is notconducive to safety. Militarism is objectionable, but a certain amount oforganized discipline is indispensable to a healthy national body. Fortunately,the recognition of this fact has not come too late, for there is no immediatedanger, as alarmists would make us believe. The geographical position of thiscountry, its vast resources and wealth, the energy and superior intelligence ofits people, make it virtually unconquerable. There is no nation to attack us that would not be ultimately defeated in theattempt. But events of the last three years have shown that a combination ofmany inimical powers is possible, and for such an emergency the United States iswholly unprepared. The first efforts must therefore be devoted to the perfectionof the best plea for national protection. This idea has taken hold of the mindsof people and great results may be expected from its creative imagination firedby this occasion, such as may in a larger measure recompense for the awfulwastage of war. While the chief reliance in this perilous situation must be placed on thearmy and navy, it is of the greatest importance to provide a big fleet ofairplanes and dirigibles for quick movement and observation; also a great numberof small high speed craft capable of fulfilling various vital duties as carriersand instruments of defense. These, together with the wireless, will be veryeffective against the U-boat, of which the cunning and scientific enemy has madea formidable weapon, threatening to paralyze the commerce of the world. As the first expedient for breaking the submarine blockade, the scheme ofemploying hundreds of small vessels, advanced by Mr. W. Denman, chairman of theUnited States Shipping Board, is a most excellent one, which cannot fail tosucceed. Another measure which will considerably reduce the toll is to use everypossible means for driving the lurking enemy far out into the sea, thusextending the distance at which he must operate and thereby lessening hischances. But a perfect apparatus for revealing his presence is what is mostneeded at this moment. A number of devices, magnetic, electric, electro-magnetic or mechanical, moreor less known, are available for this purpose. In my own experience it wasdemonstrated that the small packet boat is capable of affecting a sensitivemagnetic indicator at a distance of a few miles. But this effect can benullified in several ways. With a different form of wireless instrument devisedby me some years ago it was found practicable to locate a body of metallic orebelow the ground, and it seems that a submarine could be similarly detected. Sound waves may also be resorted to, but they cannot be depended upon.Another method is that of reflection, which might be rendered practicable,though it is handicapped by experimental difficulties well nigh insuperable. Inthe present state of the art the wireless principle is the most promising ofall, and there is no doubt that it will be applied with telling effect. But wemust be prepared for the advent of a large armored submarine of great cruisingradius, speed and destructive power which will have to be combated in otherways. For the time being no effort should be spared to develop aerial machines andmotor boats. The effectiveness of these can be largely increased by the use of aturbine, which has been repeatedly referred to in the Herald and is ideallysuited for such purposes on account of its extreme lightness, reversibility andother mechanical features. N. Tesla Tesla Answers Mr. Manierre and Further Explains the Axial Rotation of the Moon New York Tribune — Feb. 23, 1919 Sirs: In your article of February 2, Mr. Charles E. Manierre, commenting upon myarticle in \"The Electrical Experimenter\" for February, which appeared in TheTribune of January 26, suggests that I give a definition of axial rotation. I intended to be explicit on this point, as may be judged from the followingquotation: \"The unfailing test of the spinning of a mass is, however, theexistence of energy of motion. The moon is not possessed of such vis viva.\" Bythis I meant that \"axial rotation\" is not simply \"rotation upon an axis\" asnonchalantly defined in dictionaries, but is circular motion in the truephysical sense - that is, one in which half the product of the mass with thesquare of velocity is a definite and positive quantity. The moon is a nearly spherical body, of a radius of about 1,081.5 miles, fromwhich I calculate its volume to be approximately 5,300,216,300 cubic miles.Since its mean density is 3.27, one cubic foot of material composing it weighsclose to 205 pounds. Accordingly, the total weight of the satellite is about79,969,000,000, 000,000,000,000 and its mass 2,483,500,000,000,000,000terrestrial short tons. Assuming that the moon does physically rotate upon itsaxis, it performs one revolution in 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes and 11 seconds,or 2,360,591 seconds. If, in conformity with mathematical principles, we imaginethe entire mass concentrated at a distance from the center equal to two-fifthsof the radius, then the calculated rotational velocity is 3.04 feet per second,at which the globe would contain 11,474,000,000,000,000,000 short foot tons ofenergy, sufficient to run 1,000,000, 000 horsepower for a period of 1,323 years.Now, I say that there is not enough energy in the moon to run a delicate watch. In astronomical treatises usually the argument is advanced that \"if the lunarglobe did not turn upon its axis it would expose all parts to terrestrial view.As only a little over one-half is visible it must rotate.\" But this inference iserroneous, for it admits of one alternative. There are an infinite number ofaxes besides its own on each of which the moon might turn and still exhibit thesame peculiarity. I have stated in my article that the moon rotates about an axis, passingthrough the center of the earth, which is not strictly true, but does notvitiate the conclusions I have drawn. It is well known, of course, that the twobodies revolve around a common center of gravity which is at a distance of alittle over 2,899 miles from the earth’s center. Another mistake in books on astronomy is made in considering this motionequivalent to that of a weight whirled on a string or in a sling. In the firstplace, there is an essential difference between these two devices thoughinvolving the same mechanical principle. If a metal ball attached to a string iswhirled around and the latter breaks an axial rotation of the missile resultswhich is definitely related in magnitude and direction to the motion preceding.By way of illustration: If the ball is whirled on the string clockwise, tentimes a second, then when it flies off it will rotate on its axis twenty times asecond, likewise in the direction of the clock. Quite different are theconditions when the ball is thrown from a sling. In this case a much more rapidrotation is imparted to it in the opposite sense. There is not true analogy tothese in the motion of the moon. If the gravitational string, as it were, wouldsnap, the satellite would go off in a tangent without the slightest swerving orrotation, for there is no momentum about the axis and, consequently, no tendencywhatever to spinning motion. Mr. Manierre is mistaken in his surmise as to what would happen if the earthwere suddenly eliminated. Let us suppose that this would occur at the instantwhen the moon is in opposition. Then it would continue on its elliptical patharound the sun, presenting to it steadily the face which was always exposed tothe earth. If, on the other hand, the latter would disappear at the moment ofconjunction, the moon would gradually swing around through 180 degrees and,after a number of oscillations, revolve again with the same face to the sun. Ineither case there would be no periodic changes, but eternal day and night,respectively, on the sides turned toward and away from the luminary. Nikola Tesla "}]
