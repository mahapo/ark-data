Nikola Tesla’s work, although sometimes pirated or forgotten and oftenmisunderstood, has never really needed burnishing. One suspects that he ischuckling now as the world catches up to his visions and concepts since, as hewisely noted long ago, “The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result.He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work islike that of a planter—for the future.”In a mere decade this planter’s once almost forgotten name has acquired a newaura of symbolic allure that feels more at home in an era of automation and theinternet. It speaks somehow to the great wealth that was never to be his, to thebillions of dollars being earned or anticipated by his smart young admirers ofthe twenty-first century who have often commented that they are inspired by hiswork, by his patents, and notably by his dreams. A brilliant neurotic, Teslaspent his last years as an octogenarian in a New York hotel room subsisting on adiet of Nabisco crackers and the spiritual companionship of a lovely whitepigeon.Today one can scarcely pick up a copy of The Wall Street Journal or The New YorkTimes without finding a mention of him or his effect on famous young followersand admirers.It is relevant to mention that he died alone and in debt in 1943, whereuponbusy, prodigal America, his chosen country, simply forgot about him in theaftermath of World War II. And as if that were not enough, the academic officialassigned to evaluate and preserve his scientific estate—all the research andrecords he had amassed in more than fifty years—referred them to the Office ofAlien Property Custodian (though Tesla was a naturalized U.S. citizen!), whichin turn released them to his homeland, the small country of Serbia (then part ofcommunist Yugoslavia). Immediately, of course, this intellectual trove wasdeclared off-limits for generations of Americans and all other citizens exceptpossibly Russians.One may well ask, is this a hard-luck story?When I first heard the name Tesla, surprisingly he was known to relatively fewAmericans, mention of him being almost completely missing from science textbooksthrough the university level. Even his fellow electricians and engineers wereoften mystified by his boasts of taming the wild kinetic energy of earth andsky. (Indeed, had it not been for a certain ham radio operator named JohnWagner, a Michigan third-grade schoolteacher who correctly protested that it hadbeen Tesla and not the Italian fellow Guglielmo Marconi who invented radio, andwho, with his students and the rock group TESLA, devoted decades of energy toclearing away misconceptions—even those of the Smithsonian National Museum ofNatural History, which credited Edison and Marconi with some of Tesla’sinventions—the truth would have taken even longer to emerge.) Of course therewere scientists who knew or suspected that Tesla deserved the credit; but theNobel Prize Committee awarded the physics prize to Marconi for inventingwireless telegraphy and was loath to make a correction, which incidentally ithas not done to this day. In 1943 the U.S. Supreme Court decided in Tesla’sfavor, but who kept count during a world war? And unfortunately, the inventorhad died.An uneasy relationship between Tesla and Thomas Edison was definitively poisonedin the early twentieth century by a cutthroat affair known as the War of theCurrents between their respective industrial champions, the WestinghouseCorporation and General Electric Company. This was resolved with the triumph ofTesla’s alternating current system in harnessing Niagara Falls, and ultimatelywith AC electrification of the entire world. Alternating current, augmented byradio and automation, has revolutionized the basic technologies oftwenty-first-century progress.In the marshes of public perception, however, it was the all-American Edison(who gave us the phonograph, the lightbulb, and waxed paper, among many othersensible items) who for generations sprang to mind in debates over the majorachievements of the twentieth century. Many of Edison’s triumphs, unfortunately,have recently faded from everyday use, including most recently the incandescentlightbulb. In Europe a more efficient light is being developed, a descendant ofthe fluorescent tube that Tesla first demonstrated at the Chicago World’s Fairin 1893.The rediscovery of Nikola Tesla (not to mention of his great work) hasinfluenced some of the twenty-first century’s important pioneers. Larry Page,who with his partner Sergey Brin created the global search engine Google, saysthat his interest in science started early. As explained in The Economist, “Whenhe was twelve, he read a biography of Nikola Tesla, a prolific inventor whonever got credit for much, but is now a hero among geeks.” Page, a bona fidevisionary, considered writing his thesis at Stanford University on Tesla butdecided to “play it safe,” as he said, and proceeded to invent Google.When a California company recently announced its plans to produce a high-speedall-electric sports car, the entrepreneurs unsurprisingly chose the name TeslaMotor Company. Hollywood admirers predictably rushed to invest millions in itsfuture. Almost a century earlier, Tesla (one of the earliest environmentalists)had experimented with all-electric cars with limited success. He had alsodesigned a small plane called a “flying stove” that was meant to carry thecommuter from an upstairs bedroom window directly to his office. It remains oneof several unfulfilled dreams.The eccentric and controversial genius who has emerged from obscurity to becomein our time the inspiration of billionaire geeks, New Age spiritualists, rockstars, third graders, schoolteachers, poets, operatic composers, playwrights,movie and TV producers, artists, photographers, and Dadaist sculptors, as wellas the subject of a stream of books both scholastic and fantastic, may be one ofthe truly restorative figures of our age.Tesla mythology is commercially employed today by entrepreneurs as varied aschip manufacturers and the makers of video games. The marketers of a new productline at Nvidia compete with chip competitors by selling a line of Teslaproducts. It was no doubt inevitable that the builders of a video game namedDark Void would center their conspiracies on a character named Nikola Tesla.It is scarcely surprising to learn that some of Tesla’s old patents areproviding the basic concepts used in modern atmospheric physics. A controversialmilitary-industrial project known as HAARP, the high frequency active auroralresearch program, is a many-pronged exploration of the ionosphere based inAlaska. The Russian Duma has protested that it will infringe on worldcommunication systems. Technically the earth’s ionosphere was not discovereduntil 1926 by British physicist E. V. Appleton. Yet in 1900 Tesla filed a patentfor the wireless transmission of energy through this still nameless region someseventy kilometers above earth, where particles of cosmic matter from the sunare trapped between the vacuum of space and earth’s atmosphere.Tesla was galvanized by the luminous mass of swirling energy known as thenorthern lights (aurora borealis) that create a huge electrodynamic circuitabove the earth, carrying the energy of a thousand large power plants. No onecan be certain where this research will lead. Excitable writers warn thatHAARP’S “death rays” may set the sky ablaze (which is ridiculed by its creators)or permit universal mind control. Others speak of world weather control (a mixedblessing on a fractious planet) and of the ability to transmit energy bymicrowaves around the globe.Tesla’s basic idea was revisited by Atlantic Richfield Oil Company’s consultantphysicist Bernard Eastlund, who sought a less expensive way to transmit naturalgas from remote areas. He proposed a “pipeline” in the sky, using natural gas topower microwave transmitters. The microwaves would be sped great distancesthrough the ionosphere, then beamed down to satellites and converted toelectrical power on earth. In short, HAARP is simply vintage Tesla in modernhands, another reminder that he still looks down upon us.M.C.2010 "},{"pageContent":"FOREWORD LELAND ANDERSON Despite the flashy, dramatic, and often limelight attention that Nikola Teslawas given in the heyday of his reign in the fields of research and engineering,he maintained a very private personal life. Since he was a loner—a perennialbachelor, working apart, not entering into corporate associations, and notmixing friends—his personal life was obscure to outsiders. Such reclusivenessmarking the career of one of the world’s leading figures in science andengineering can pose severe analytical obstacles for a biographer. However,almost immediately after Tesla’s death at the age of eighty-six in 1943, thebiography Prodigal Genius appeared by John J. O’Neill, science editor of the NewYork Herald Tribune. For many years it stood as the only biography of Tesla,primarily because of the difficulty for any other would-be biographer to uncoversignificant additional information about him.Following World War II, the tons of material representing Tesla’s library wereshipped to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the country of his birth (Tesla was a U.S.citizen), where a state museum was established in his name. The circumstancessurrounding the transfer of his estate to Yugoslavia are interesting but willnot be commented upon here except to point out the problem of remoteness of sucha museum for any biographer in this country, let alone the severe restrictionson access to archival materials that exist for researchers venturing to themuseum.In 1959, two rather short biographies of Tesla appeared. Dr. Helen Walter’s bookwas intended for young people, and curiously contained illustration andfrontispiece sketches quite unlike Tesla’s appearance. Margaret Storm’s book,published by herself and printed in green ink, was based on the assertion thatTesla was an embodiment of a superior being from the planet Venus! Another shortbiography intended for young people appeared in 1961 by Arthur Beckhard. Tesla’sname was misspelled on the dust jacket (Tesla once wrote to a friend that hewished he could turn all the forked lightning in his laboratory on critics whomisspell his name), and the book omits essentially everything on his life after1900 (Tesla was then forty-four). All three authors leaned heavily on O’Neill’sbiography, as evidenced by the perpetuation of a number of erroneous legendsthat subsequent study has vitiated, and none of the three extended O’Neill’streatment.Lightning in His Hand: The Life Story of Nikola Tesla, by Inez Hunt and WanettaDraper, nearby residents of Colorado Springs, appeared in 1964, twenty yearsafter O’Neill’s biography. O’Neill did not venture to Colorado Springs, whereTesla established an experimental station in 1899 and conducted electricalexperiments which to this very day amaze scientists the world over, andconsequently did not benefit from information that could have been provided byresidents of that city about Tesla’s interactions with them. Tesla took on fleshand bones to some degree in Hunt and Draper’s biography, and the book carriednumerous photographs. Much of the focus of the book concerned Tesla’s half-yearstay in the Springs, which was the original intent of the authors.Why should anyone actually wish to undertake another full biography after theappearance of O’Neill’s Prodigal Genius? It has been considered the mostauthoritative biography extant, and probably was the best effort that could havebeen produced by anyone at that time, with the exception of Kenneth Swezey—ascience writer and Tesla’s close personal friend during the last twenty-plusyears of his life. However, from this vantage point of distance in time,O’Neill’s biography is now seen to be weak insofar as it analyzed Tesla the manand thin with regard to his interactions with personal associates and friends.Even though O’Neill and Tesla were amicable, Tesla kept O’Neill at a distance,and O’Neill gleaned only what he was able to pry out of Tesla with greatdifficulty—certainly not the most ideal liaison for a biographer.Much information has surfaced since the appearance of O’Neill’s biography,adding new dimensions to the extent of knowledge about Tesla. Many questionsasked by students of his life have been answered; however, this unfolding hasalso presented many more mysteries. The Freedom of Information Acts revealedthat the federal government had a great interest in Tesla’s papers. Whyshouldn’t it? In the midst of World War II, and at press conferences, Teslaoften startled reporters with talk of developing weapons with beams that wouldmelt aircraft, telegeodynamics, and other advanced concepts. Whether real orspeculative, the federal government took no chances. What became of theseinvestigations by federal agencies is a story in itself.In reviewing my own interest in Tesla, since high school days I was fascinatedby his high frequency, high voltage researches for which he became world known.I was disturbed, however, by the inordinate difficulty in obtaining copies ofhis technical writings and, as well, identifying references to writings byothers about Tesla’s work. This prompted what was to become a project of manyyears—that of producing an exhaustive catalog (published in 1979 as abibliography and for which I served as co-editor) of the writings by and aboutTesla and his work. In the course of pursuing studies in electrical engineering,and continuing interest in Tesla’s high frequency, high voltage researches, myinquiries eventually led me to meet those who worked for him, such as hissecretaries Dorothy Skerritt and Muriel Arbus, and laboratory technicians suchas Walter Wilhelm. Along the way, his personal friends came into the picture aswell as others who had known Tesla on a person-to-person basis.As the Tesla Centennial (1956) approached, it became apparent that noobservances were being arranged by the major scientific and engineeringorganizations in this country to signal the event. Together with Skerritt,Arbus, Wilhelm, and a number of other interested persons, therefore, I helpedfound the Tesla Society—the function of which was to develop and coordinateactivities for the centennial observance. Following the centennial year, theSociety expired, but an awareness of Tesla’s impact on society was regeneratedin the hiatus since his death. An interest had been reawakened in thediscoveries that he announced and demonstrated, but which had been retarded indevelopment because of a technology lag in associated disciplines, such asmaterial sciences.Inspiration—that is what he gave to other inventors whose endeavors his lifespanned, and that is what his work continues to give to technical specialists inthese times. On the occasion of Tesla’s seventy-fifth birthday (1931), hiscontemporaries wrote that his lectures were then both as imaginative andinspirational to productive development as when they were first published fortyyears before that:In almost every step of progress in electrical power engineering, as well as inradio, we can trace the spark of thought back to Nikola Tesla. There are fewindeed who in their lifetime see realization of such a far-flung imagination.(E. F. W. Alexanderson)> In reading of Tesla’s work one is constantly struck by his many suggestions> which have anticipated later developments in the radio art. (Louis Cohen)> Prolific inventor, who solved the greatest problem in electrical engineering> of his time, and gave to the world the polyphase motor and system of> distribution, revolutionizing the power art and founding its phenomenal> development. My contact as your assistant at the historic Columbia University> high frequency lecture and afterward has left an indelible impression and> inspiration which has influenced my life. (Gano Dunn)> You fanned into a never dying flame my latent interest in gaseous conduction.> Early in 1894 I told our mutual friend that your book… which contains your> original lectures, would still be considered a classic a hundred years hence.> I have not changed my opinion. (D. McFarlan Moore)> I remember vividly the eagerness and fascination with which I read your> account of the high tension experiments more than forty years ago. They were> most original and daring: they opened up new vistas for exploration by thought> and experiment. (W. H. Bragg)> There are three aspects of Tesla’s work which particularly deserve our> admiration: The importance of the achievements in themselves, as judged by> their practical bearing; the logical clearness and purity of thought, with> which the arguments are pursued and new results obtained; the vision and the> inspiration, I should almost say the courage, of seeing remote things far> ahead and so opening up new avenues to mankind. (I. C. M. Brentano)Today, we yet find that the writings of Tesla retain their undiminished power ofinspirational endeavor to the reader. Tesla was indeed out of his time, and thisbiography represents a distinct achievement in overcoming unusual investigativeobstacles to bring his remarkable story to life.Denver, Colorado "},{"pageContent":"1.

Tall and slender,elegantly attired, he was the cynosure of all eyes, though most diners, mindfulof the celebrated inventor’s need for privacy, pretended not to stare.Eighteen clean linen napkins were stacked as usual at his place. Nikola Teslacould no more have said why he favored numbers divisible by three than why hehad a morbid fear of germs or, for that matter, why he was beset by any of themultitude of other strange obsessions that plagued his life.Abstractedly he began to polish the already sparkling silver and crystal, takingup and discarding one square of linen after another until a small starchedmountain had risen on the serving table. Then, as each dish arrived, hecompulsively calculated its cubic contents before lifting a bite to his lips.Otherwise there could be no joy in eating.Those who came to the Palm Room for the express purpose of observing theinventor might have noted that he did not order his meal from the menu. Asusual, it had been specially prepared beforehand according to his telephonedinstructions and now was being served at his request not by a waiter but by themaître d’hôtel himself.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos891919]While Tesla picked at his food, William K. Vanderbilt paused to chide the youngSerb for not making better use of the Vanderbilt box at the opera. And shortlyafter he left, a scholarly-looking man in a Van Dyke beard and small rimlessglasses came to Tesla’s table and greeted him with particular affection. RobertUnderwood Johnson, in addition to being a magazine editor and poet, was asocially ambitious and well-connected bon vivant.Grinning, Johnson bent down and whispered in Tesla’s ear the latest rumorcirculating among the “400”: a demure schoolgirl named Anne Morgan, it seemed,had a crush on the inventor and was pestering her papa, J. Pierpont, for anintroduction.Tesla smiled in his modest way and inquired after Johnson’s wife, Katharine.“Kate has asked me to bring you to lunch on Saturday,” said Johnson.They discussed for a moment another guest of whom Tesla was fond—but only in aplatonic way—a charming young pianist named Marguerite Merington. Assured thatshe too had been asked, he accepted the invitation.The editor went his way, and Tesla returned his attention to the cubic contentsof his dessert course. He had barely completed his calculations when a messengerappeared at his table and handed him a note. He recognized at once the boldscrawl of his friend Mark Twain.“If you do not have more exciting plans for the evening,” wrote the humorist,“perhaps you will join me at the Players’ Club.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos892274]Tesla scribbled a hasty reply: “Alas, I must work. But if you will join me in mylaboratory at midnight, I think I can promise you some good entertainment.”It was, as usual, precisely ten o’clock when Tesla rose from his table andvanished into the erratically lighted streets of Manhattan.Strolling back toward his laboratory, he turned into a small park and whistledsoftly. From high in the walls of a nearby building came a rustling of wings.Soon a familiar white shape fluttered to rest on his shoulder. Tesla took a bagof grain from his pocket, fed the pigeon from his hand, then wafted her into thenight, and blew her a kiss.Now he considered his next move. If he continued on around the block, he wouldfeel compelled to circle it three times. With a sigh, he turned and walkedtoward his laboratory at 33–35 South Fifth Avenue (now West Broadway), nearBleecker Street.Entering the familiar loft building in the darkness, he closed a master switch.Tube lighting on the walls sprang into brilliance, illuminating a shadowy cavernfilled with weirdly shaped machinery. The strange thing about this tube lightingwas that it had no connections to the loops of electrical wiring around theceiling. Indeed, it had no connections at all, drawing all its energy from anambient force field. He could pick up an unattached light and move it freely toany part of the workshop.In a corner an odd contraption began to vibrate silently. Tesla’s eyes narrowedwith satisfaction. Here under a kind of platform, the tiniest of oscillators wasat work. Only he knew its awesome power.Thoughtfully he glanced through a window to the black shapes of tenements below.His hardworking immigrant neighbors appeared safely asleep. The police hadwarned him of complaints about the blue lightning flaring from his windows andelectricity snapping through the streets after dark.He shrugged and turned to his work, making a series of microscopic adjustmentsto a machine. Deep in concentration, he was unaware of the passage of time untilhe heard a pounding on the door at street level.Tesla hurried down to greet an English journalist, Chauncey McGovern ofPearson’s Magazine.“I’m so pleased you could come, Mr. McGovern.”“I felt I owed it to my readers, sir. Everyone in London is talking about theNew Wizard of the West—and they don’t mean Mr. Edison.”“Well, come along up. Let’s see if I can justify my reputation.”As they turned to the stairs there came a ring of laughter from the streetentrance and a voice that Tesla recognized.“Ah, that’s Mark.”He opened the door again to welcome Twain and the actor Joseph Jefferson. Bothhad come directly from the Players’ Club. Twain’s eyes sparkled in anticipation.“Let’s have the show, Tesla. You know what I always say.”“No, what do you say, Mark?” the inventor asked with a smile.“What I always say, and mind you they’ll be quoting me into the hereafter, isthat thunder is good, thunder is impressive, but it is lightning that does thework.”“Then we’ll get a storm of work done tonight, my friend. Come along.”“Not to stagger on being shown through the laboratory of Nikola Tesla,” McGovernwould later recall, “requires the possession of an uncommonly sturdy mind….“Fancy yourself seated in a large, well-lighted room, with mountains ofcurious-looking machinery on all sides. A tall, thin young man walks up to you,and by merely snapping his fingers creates instantaneously a ball of leaping redflame, and holds it calmly in his hands. As you gaze you are surprised to see itdoes not burn his fingers. He lets it fall upon his clothing, on his hair, intoyour lap, and, finally, puts the ball of flame into a wooden box. You are amazedto see that nowhere does the flame leave the slightest trace, and you rub youreyes to make sure you are not asleep.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos892456]If McGovern was baffled by Tesla’s fireball, he was at least not alone. None ofhis contemporaries could explain how Tesla produced this oft-repeated effect,and no one can explain it today.The odd flame having been extinguished as mysteriously as it appeared, Teslaswitched off the lights, and the room became black as a cave.“Now, my friends, I will make for you some daylight.”Suddenly, the whole laboratory was flooded with strange, beautiful light.McGovern, Twain, and Jefferson cast their eyes around the room, but they couldfind no trace of the source of the illumination. McGovern wondered vaguely ifthis eerie effect might somehow be connected with a demonstration Tesla hadreportedly given in Paris in which he had produced illumination between twolarge plates set at each side of a stage, yet with no source of light apparent.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_047.html#filepos1161265]But the light show was merely a warm-up for the inventor’s guests.Lines oftension on Tesla’s face betrayed the seriousness with which he himself regardedthe next experiment.A small animal was brought from a cage, tied to a platform, and quicklyelectrocuted. The indicator registered one thousand volts. The body was removed.Then Tesla, with one hand in his pocket, leaped lightly upon the same platform.The voltage indicator began slowly climbing. At last two million volts ofelectricity were pouring “through” the frame of the tall young man, who did notmove a muscle. His silhouette was now sharply defined with a halo of electricityformed by myriad tongues of flame darting out from every part of his body.Seeing the shock on McGovern’s face, he extended one hand to the Englishinterviewer, who described the strange sensation: “You twist it about in thesame fashion as you have seen people do who hold the handles of a strongelectric battery. The young man is literally a human electric ‘live wire.’”The inventor leaped down from the platform, turned off the current, and relaxedthe tension of his audience by tossing off the performance as no more than atrick. “Pshaw! These are only a few playthings. None of these amount toanything. They are of no value to the great world of science. But come overhere, and I will show you something that will make a big revolution in everyhospital and home as soon as I am able to get the thing into working form.”He led his guests to the corner where a strange platform was mounted on rubberpadding. When he flipped a switch, it began to vibrate rapidly and silently.Twain stepped forward, eager. “Let me try it, Tesla. Please.”“No, no. It needs work.”“Please.”Tesla chuckled. “All right, Mark, but don’t stay on too long. Come off when Igive you the word.” He called to an attendant to throw the switch.Twain, in his usual white suit and black string tie, found himself humming andvibrating on the platform like a gigantic bumblebee. He was delighted. Hewhooped and waved his arms. The others watched in amusement.After a time the inventor said, “All right, Mark. You’ve had enough. Come downnow.”“Not by a jugful,” said the humorist. “I am enjoying this.”“But seriously, you had better come down,” insisted Tesla. “Believe me, it isbest that you do so.”Twain only laughed. “You couldn’t get me off this with a derrick.”The words were scarcely out of his mouth when his expression froze. He lurchedstiffly toward the edge of the platform, frantically waving at Tesla to stop it.“Quick, Tesla. Where is it?”The inventor helped him down with a smile and propelled him in the direction ofthe rest room. The laxative effect of the vibrator was well known to him and hisassistants.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos892691]None of his guests had volunteered to undergo the experiment in which Teslastood on the high-voltage platform; they never did. But now they clamored for anexplanation of why he had not been electrocuted.As long as the frequencies were high, he said, alternating currents of greatvoltages flowed largely on the outer surface of the skin without injury. But itwas no stunt for amateurs, he warned. Milliamperes penetrating nerve tissuecould be fatal, while amperes distributed over the skin could be tolerated forshort periods. Very low currents flowing beneath the skin, whether alternatingcurrent or direct current, could kill.It was dawn when Tesla finally said good-night to his guests. But the lightsburned on in his laboratory for another hour before he locked the doors andwalked to his hotel for a brief period of rest."},{"pageContent":"2. A GAMBLING MAN Nikola Tesla was born at precisely midnight between July 9 and 10, 1856, in thevillage of Smiljan, province of Lika, Croatia, between Yugoslavia’s VelebitMountains and the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea. The tiny house in which hewas born stood next to the Serbian Orthodox Church presided over by his father,the Reverend Milutin Tesla, who sometimes wrote articles under the nom-de-plume“Man of Justice.”No country in Eastern Europe had greater ethnic and religious diversity thanYugoslavia. Within Croatia the Serbian Teslas were part of a racial andreligious minority. The province then belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire ofthe Hapsburgs to whose heavy-handed rule the people adapted as best they could.Ethnic traditions are often most tenaciously observed by transplanted minoritiesand the Teslas were no exception. They placed great store on Serbian martialsongs, poetry, dancing, and storytelling, as well as on weaving and thecelebration of saints’ days.Although illiteracy was more common than not in that time and place, it was of arare mind-expanding kind, for the people both admired and cultivated prodigiousfeats of memory.In the Croatia of Tesla’s childhood, choices of career were more or less limitedto farming, the Army, or the Church. The families of Milutin Tesla and his wifeD-uka Mandić, who came originally from western Serbia, had for generations senttheir sons to serve Church or Army and their daughters to marry ministers orofficers.Milutin had originally been sent to Army officers’ school, but he had rebelledand left to join the ministry. This he saw as the only career for his sons, Dane(or Daniel) and Nikola. As for their sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, theReverend Tesla hoped that God in His wisdom and mercy would provide them withclerical husbands like himself.The life of a Yugoslav woman was grueling, for she was expected not only to dothe heavy work of the farm but also to raise the children and care for the homeand family. Tesla always said that he inherited his photographic memory and hisinventive genius from his mother, and deplored that she had not lived in acountry and at a time when women’s abilities were fairly rewarded. She had beenthe eldest daughter in a family of seven children, forced to take over when hermother became blind. Hence she herself got no schooling. But either in spite orbecause of that, she had developed an amazing memory, being able to reciteverbatim whole volumes of native and classic European poetry.After her marriage, her own five children arrived quickly. The eldest wasDaniel. Nikola was the fourth.Since the Rev. Milutin Tesla wrote poetry in his spare time, the boy grew up ina household where cadence always permeated ordinary speech and where the quotingof passages from the Bible or poetry was as natural as roasting corn overcharcoal in summer.In his youth Nikola also wrote poetry and would later take some to America withhim. He would never permit his poems to be published, however, considering themtoo personal. When he grew older, it would delight him to astonish new friendsby reciting their native poetry (in English, French, German, or Italian) atimpromptu meetings. He continued to write an occasional poem throughout hislife.The child began when only a few years of age to make original inventions. Whenhe was five, he built a small waterwheel quite unlike those he had seen in thecountryside. It was smooth, without paddles, yet it spun evenly in the current.Years later he was to recall this fact when designing his unique bladelessturbine.But some of his other experiments were less successful. Once he perched on theroof of the barn, clutching the family umbrella and hyperventilating on thefresh mountain breeze until his body felt light and the dizziness in his headconvinced him he could fly. Plunging to earth, he lay unconscious and wascarried off to bed by his mother.His sixteen-bug-power motor was, likewise, not an unqualified success. This wasa light contrivance made of splinters forming a windmill, with a spindle andpulley attached to live June bugs. When the glued insects beat their wings, asthey did desperately, the bug-power engine prepared to take off. This line ofresearch was forever abandoned however when a young friend dropped by whofancied the taste of June bugs. Noticing a jarful standing near, he begancramming them into his mouth. The youthful inventor threw up.He next endeavored to take apart and reassemble the clocks of his grandfather.This too, he recalled, came to an end: “In the former operation I was alwayssuccessful but often failed in the latter.” Thirty years passed before he wouldtackle clockwork again.Not all his youthful chagrins were scientific in nature. “There was a wealthylady in town,” he later recalled in a brief autobiography, “a good but pompouswoman, who used to come to the church gorgeously painted up and attired with anenormous train and attendants. One Sunday I had just finished ringing the bellin the belfry and rushed downstairs when this grand dame was sweeping out and Ijumped on her train. It tore off with a ripping noise which sounded like a salvoof musketry fired by raw recruits.”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos893005]His father, although livid with rage, gave him only a gentle slap on thecheek—“the only corporal punishment he ever administered to me but I almost feelit now.” Tesla said his embarrassment and confusion were indescribable, and hewas practically ostracized.However, good fortune threw him a rope, and he was redeemed in the eyes of thevillage. A new fire engine had been purchased, along with uniforms for a firedepartment, and this called for a celebration. The community turned out for aparade, there were speeches, and then the command was given to pump water withthe new equipment. Not a drop came from the nozzle. While the village fathersstood in puzzled dismay, the bright lad flung himself into the river and found,as he had suspected, that the hose had collapsed. He corrected the problem,instantly drenching the delighted village fathers. Long after, Tesla wouldrecall that “Archimedes running naked thru the streets of Syracuse did not makea greater impression than myself. I was carried on the shoulders and was thehero of the day.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos893303]In bucolic Smiljan where his first few years were spent, the intense child withthe pale wedge-shaped face and shock of black hair seemed to live a charmedlife. Just as in later years he would work with high voltages of electricitywithout serious harm, he then skated through extraordinary dangers.With telescopic memory and perhaps some exaggeration, he later wrote that he wasgiven up by doctors as a hopeless physical wreck three times, that he was almostdrowned on numerous occasions, was nearly boiled alive in a vat of hot milk,just missed being cremated, and was once entombed (overnight in an old shrine).Hair-raising flights from mad dogs, enraged flocks of crows, and sharp-tuskedhogs spiced this catalogue of near-catastrophes.3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos893447]Yet outwardly his parents’ home provided an idyllic pastoral scene. Sheep grazedin the pasture, pigeons cooed in a cote, and there were chickens for a small boyto tend. Each morning he delighted in watching the flock of geese that rosemagnificently to the clouds; they returned from the feeding grounds at sundown“in battle formation, so perfect that it would have put a squadron of the bestaviators of the present day to shame.”For all of this outward beauty, however, there were ogres in the boy’s mind, thelasting trauma of a family tragedy. As far back as he could remember, his lifehad been profoundly influenced by his older brother, who was seven at the timeof Nikola’s birth. Daniel, brilliant and the idol of his parents, was killed atthe age of twelve in a mysterious accident.The immediate cause of the tragedy may have been a magnificent Arabian horsewhich had been given to the family by a dear friend. It was petted by them andattributed with almost human intelligence. In fact this beautiful creature hadonce saved the father’s life in the wolf-infested mountains. But according toTesla’s autobiography, Daniel died of injuries caused by the horse. Of theincident itself, however, no details remain.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos893582]Anything Nikola did thereafter, he claimed, seemed dull by comparison to thepromise of the dead brother. His own achievements “merely caused my parents tofeel their loss more keenly. So I grew up with little confidence in myself. ButI was far from being considered a stupid boy….”A second more psychologically intricate version exists as to how Tesla’s olderbrother died. According to the second version, Daniel died from a fall down thecellar stairs. Some believe that the boy lost consciousness and in his deliriumaccused Nikola of pushing him. He died later from the head injury, probably ahematoma, so this account goes. Unfortunately at this date both versions areimpossible to confirm.Much later in his life, Tesla still suffered from nightmares and hallucinationsrelated to the death of his brother. The details of the experience are neverclarified, but the episode recurs and is recounted throughout his life as iffrom various time frames. One can theorize that a five-year-old child, unable totolerate such a burden of assumed guilt, might have rewritten the facts in hismind.We can only speculate about the degree to which Daniel’s death may have beenresponsible for the fantastic array of phobias and obsessions that Nikolasubsequently developed. All we can say for certain is that some manifestationsof his extreme eccentricity seem to have appeared at an early age.For example, he had a violent aversion to earrings on women, especially pearls,although jewelry with the glitter of crystals or sharp-planed facets intriguedhim. The smell of a piece of camphor anywhere in the house caused him acutediscomfort. In research, if he dropped little squares of paper in a dish filledwith liquid, it caused a peculiar and awful taste in his mouth. He counted stepswhen walking, calculated the cubic contents of soup plates, coffee cups, andpieces of food. If he failed to do so his meal was unenjoyable—hence hispreference for dining alone. And perhaps most serious insofar as physicalrelationships were to be concerned, he claimed that he could not touch the hairof other people, “except perhaps at the point of a revolver.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos893725] But wecannot precisely date the onset of these or his many other phobias.According to Tesla, hoping to console his parents for the loss of Daniel, hesubjected himself at a very early age to iron discipline in order to excel. Hewould be more spartan, more studious than other boys, more generous, and inevery way superior. And it was while denying himself and repressing naturalimpulses, he later believed, that he began to develop his strange compulsions.If Tesla’s character did begin to change, the symptoms were not entirelyapparent until some time after Daniel’s death. “Up until the age of eightyears,” he wrote, “my character was weak and vacillating.” He dreamed of ghostsand ogres, feared life, death, and God. But then there did come a kind ofchange, as the result of his favorite pastime—which was reading in his father’swell-stocked library. The Rev. Milutin Tesla at one point forbade Nikola to havecandles, fearing that he would ruin his eyes by reading all night. The boy gotsome materials and made his own, stuffed rags in the keyhole and door cracks,and then read all night. He did not stop reading until he heard his motherbeginning her arduous rounds at dawn.The book that changed his vacillating nature was Abafi or The Son of Aba, by aleading Hungarian novelist—a work that “somehow awakened my dormant powers ofwill and I began to practice self-control.” To the rigorous discipline thendeveloped, he attributed his later success as an inventor.6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos893860]From birth he was intended for the clergy. Although he longed to become anengineer, his father was inflexible. To prepare him, the Reverend Teslainitiated a daily routine: “It comprised all sorts of exercises—as guessing oneanother’s thoughts, discovering the defects of some form or expression,repeating long sentences or performing mental calculations. These daily lessonswere intended to strengthen memory and reason and especially to develop thecritical sense, and were undoubtedly very beneficial.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos893994]Of his mother he wrote that she was “an inventor of the first order and would, Ibelieve, have achieved great things had she not been so remote from modern lifeand its multifold opportunities. She invented and constructed all kinds of toolsand devices and wove the finest designs from thread which was spun by her. Sheeven planted the seeds, raised the plants, and separated the fibers herself. Sheworked indefatigably, from break of day till late at night, and most of thewearing apparel and furnishings of the home was the product of her hands.”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos894137]The brilliant Daniel, before his untimely death, had been subject to strongflashes of light that interfered with his normal vision during moments ofexcitement. A similar phenomenon plagued Tesla during most of his life,beginning in childhood.He described it years later as “a peculiar affliction due to the appearance ofimages, often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which marred the sight ofreal objects and interfered with my thought and action. They were pictures ofthings and scenes which I had really seen, never of those I imagined. When aword was spoken to me the image of the object it designated would present itselfvividly to my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whetherwhat I saw was tangible or not. This caused me great discomfort and anxiety.None of the students of psychology or physiology whom I have consulted couldever explain satisfactorily these phenomena….”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos894281]He theorized that the images resulted from a reflex action from the brain uponthe retina under great excitation. They were not hallucinations. In thestillness of night, the vivid picture of a funeral he had seen or some otherdisturbing scene would thrust itself before his eyes, so that even if he jabbedhis hand through it, it would remain fixed in space.“If my explanation is correct,” he wrote, “it should be possible to project on ascreen the image of any object one conceives and make it visible. Such anadvance would revolutionize all human relations. I am convinced that this wondercan and will be accomplished in time to come; I may add that I have devoted muchthought to the solution of the problem.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos894425]Since Tesla’s time parapsychologists have studied subjects who purportedly canproject their mental images onto rolls of unexposed photographic film. Thedirect transmission of thought onto electronic printers also is the subject ofrecent research.To free himself of the tormenting images and to obtain temporary relief, theyoung Tesla began to conjure up imaginary worlds. Every night he would start onmake-believe journeys—see new places, cities, and countries, live there, meetpeople and make friends, and “however unbelievable, it is a fact that they werejust as dear to me as those in actual life and not a bit less intense in theirmanifestations.”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos894561]This he did constantly until the age of seventeen, when his thoughts turnedseriously to invention. Then, to his delight, he found that he could visualizewith such facility that he needed no models, drawings, or experiments, but couldpicture them all as real in his mind.He recommended this method as far more expeditious and efficient than the purelyexperimental. Anyone who carries out a construct, Tesla held, runs the risk ofbecoming bogged down in the details and defects of the apparatus and, as thedesigner goes on improving, tends to lose sight of the underlying principle ofthe design.“My method is different,” he wrote. “I do not rush into actual work. When I getan idea I start at once building it up in my imagination. I change theconstruction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind. It isabsolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in my thought or test it inmy shop. I even note if it is out of balance.”12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos894697]Thus, he claimed he was able to perfect a conception without touching anything.Only when all the faults had been corrected in his brain did he put the deviceinto concrete form.“Invariably,” he wrote, “my device works as I conceived that it should, and theexperiment comes out exactly as I planned it. In twenty years there has not beena single exception. Why should it be otherwise? Engineering, electrical andmechanical, is positive in results. There is scarcely a subject that cannot bemathematically treated and the effects calculated or the results determinedbeforehand from the available theoretical and practical data….”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos894833]Despite such claims, Tesla did in fact often make small sketches of inventionsin whole or in part. Later in life his methods of research came to resemble moreclosely the empirical approach of Edison.Tesla’s childhood development is confusing because he enhanced his native talentwith such rigorous mental discipline that it is impossible to separate theinnate gifts from the acquired. Some people, for example, prefer to think ofTesla’s prodigious memory as being in no way abnormal but merely the result ofmaking the most of what God gave him. Yet the ability to memorize a page of typeor the precise relationships and sizes of myriad patterns on a page in the winkof an eye—call it photographic, eidetic, or whatever—does seem to belong to thespecially gifted. Such memory usually begins to wane in adolescence, indicatingthat it is affected by bodily chemical changes.In Tesla’s case, perhaps because of his special training in early childhood andhis subsequent self-discipline, his phenomenal memory was retained throughoutmuch of his life. The fact that he began to make trial-and-error adjustments ofhis research equipment in Colorado when he was middle-aged hints at a waningpower.He claimed that his method of visual invention had one defect that kept him poorin a monetary sense, though rich in the raptures of the mind: Potentiallyvaluable inventions were often put aside without the final time-consumingperfection required for commercial success. Edison would never have allowed thisto happen and hired many assistants to make sure it did not. In fact Edison wassaid to have a knack for picking up other inventors’ ideas and rushing them tothe Patent Office. With Tesla it was to be just the opposite. Ideas chased eachother through his mind faster than he could nail them down. Once he understoodexactly how an invention worked (in his mind), he tended to lose interest, forthere were always exciting new challenges just over the horizon.His photographic memory explained in part the lifelong difficulty he wouldexperience in working with other engineers. While they demanded blueprints, heworked in his mind. In grade school he was almost kept back, despite brilliancein mathematics, because he so loathed the required drawing classes.He was twelve years old before he succeeded in banishing disturbing images fromhis mind by deliberate effort; but he was never able to control the inexplicableflashes of light that usually occurred when he was in a dangerous or distressingsituation, or when he was greatly elated. Sometimes he saw all the air aroundhim filled with tongues of living flame. Their intensity, instead ofdiminishing, increased with years and reached a peak when he was abouttwenty-five.At sixty he reported, “These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves fromtime to time, as when a new idea opening up possibilities strikes me, but theyare no longer exciting, being of relatively small intensity. When I close myeyes, I invariably observe first, a background of very dark and uniform blue,not unlike the sky on a clear but starless night. In a few seconds this fieldbecomes animated with innumerable scintillating flakes of green, arranged inseveral layers and advancing towards me. Then there appears, to the right, abeautiful pattern of two systems of parallel and closely spaced lines, at rightangles to one another, in all sorts of colors with yellow-green and goldpredominating. Immediately thereafter the lines grow brighter and the whole isthickly sprinkled with dots of twinkling light. This picture moves slowly acrossthe field of vision and in about ten seconds vanishes to the left, leavingbehind a ground of rather unpleasant and inert grey which quickly gives way to abillowy sea of clouds, seemingly trying to mould themselves in living shapes. Itis curious that I cannot project a form into this grey until the second phase isreached. Every time, before falling asleep, images of persons or objects flitbefore my view. When I see them I know that I am about to lose consciousness. Ifthey are absent and refuse to come it means a sleepless night.”14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos894969]In school he excelled at languages, learning English, French, German, andItalian as well as the Slavic dialects, but it was math at which he starred. Hewas that unnerving sort of student who lurks behind the instructor whileproblems are being written on the board, and quietly chalks down answers themoment the teacher has finished. At first they suspected him of cheating. Butsoon it was realized that this was just another aspect of his abnormal abilityto visualize and retain images. The optic screen in his mind stored entirelogarithmic tables to be called on as needed. After he became an inventor,however, he would sometimes have to struggle for long periods to solve a singlescientific problem.He reported another curious phenomenon that is familiar to many creative people,i.e., that there always came a moment when he was not concentrating but when heknew he had the answer, even though it had not yet materialized. “And thewonderful thing is,” he said, “that if I do feel this way, then I know I havereally solved the problem and shall get what I am after.”Practical results generally confirmed this intuition. It is a fact that in laterlife the machines that Tesla built nearly always worked. He might err in hisunderstanding of the scientific principle, or he might even mistake the qualityof materials used in construction, but somehow the machines, as they evolved inhis mind and were later translated into metal, usually did just what heintended.Had there been school psychologists in his childhood, the bedeviling images thatwarred with his sense of reality might easily have earned him a diagnosis ofschizophrenia, and therapy or drugs might have been prescribed—perhaps to “cure”the very fountain of his creativity.When he first discovered that the pictures in his mind could always be traced toactual scenes which he had previously observed, he believed he had hit upon atruth of great importance. He made a point of always trying to trace theexternal source. In short, before Freud’s methods were well known, he waspracticing a kind of autoanalysis, and after a while this effort grew to bealmost reflexive.“I gained great facility in connecting cause and effect,” he reported. “Soon Ibecame aware, to my surprise, that every thought I conceived was suggested by anexternal impression.”15[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos895105]The conclusion he drew from this exercise was not altogether heartening.Everything he did that he had thought to be the result of free will he nowdecided was actually caused by real circumstances and events. And if this weretrue it followed that he himself must be merely a kind of automaton. Conversely,anything a human being could do, a machine could be made to do, including actingwith judgment based upon experience.From these meditations the young Tesla developed two concepts that—in ratherdifferent ways—were to be important to him in later life. The first was thathuman beings could be adequately understood as “meat machines.” The second wasthat machines could, for all practical purposes, be made human. The first ideamay have done nothing to improve his sociability, but the second was to lead himdeep into the strange world of what he called “teleautomatics” or robotry.The Teslas had moved to the nearby city of Gospić when Nikola was six. There heentered school and had seen his first mechanical models, including waterturbines. He built many of them and found great pleasure in operating them. Healso became fascinated by a description he had read of Niagara Falls. In hisimagination a big wheel appeared, run by the cascading waters. He told his unclethat one day he would go to America and carry out this vision. Thirty yearslater, seeing his idea materialize, Tesla would marvel “at the unfathomablemystery of the mind.”At ten he entered the gymnasium, which was new and had a fairly well-equippeddepartment of physics. The demonstrations performed by his instructorsfascinated him. Here his brilliance in mathematics shone, but his father “hadconsiderable trouble in railroading me from one class to another” because hecould not endure the required course in freehand drawing.In the second year he became obsessed with the idea of producing continuousmotion through steady air pressure, and with the possibilities of a vacuum. Hegrew frantic with his desire to harness these forces but for a long time gropedin the dark. Finally, he recalled, “my endeavors crystallized in an inventionwhich was to enable me to achieve what no other mortal ever attempted.” It wasall part of his consuming dream of being able to fly.“Every day I used to transport myself through the air to distant regions butcould not understand just how I managed to do it,” he recalled. “Now I hadsomething concrete—a flying machine with nothing more than a rotating shaft,flapping wings, and … a vacuum of unlimited power!”16[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos895241]What he built was a cylinder freely rotatable on two bearings and partlysurrounded by a rectangular trough which fit it perfectly. The open side of thetrough was closed by a partition and the cylindrical segment divided into twocompartments entirely separated from each other by airtight sliding joints. Oneof these compartments being sealed and exhausted of air, the other remainingopen, perpetual rotation of the cylinder would result—or so the inventorthought. And indeed, when he had finished, the shaft rotated slightly.“From that time on I made my daily aerial excursions in a vehicle of comfort andluxury as might have befitted King Solomon,” he recalled. “It took years beforeI understood that the atmospheric pressure acted at right angles to the surfaceof the cylinder and that the slight rotary effort I observed was due to a leak.Though this knowledge came gradually it gave me a painful shock.”17[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos895394]While at this school—for which he was probably too advanced— he was prostrated“with a dangerous illness, or rather a score of them, and my condition became sodesperate that I was given up by physicians.” To aid his recovery after therehad been a change for the better, he was allowed to read. Finally he was askedto catalog the books at the local library, a task which, he later recalled,introduced him to the earliest works of Mark Twain. To his delight in findingthem he attributed a miraculous recovery. Unfortunately, the anecdote has thering of apocrypha, for Twain at that time had written almost nothing that mighthave found its way across the ocean and into a Croatian library. Whatever thetruth of the story, Tesla liked it and stuck by it. Twenty-five years later hemet the great humorist in New York City, told him of the experience, and wasamazed, he said, to see Twain burst into tears.The boy continued his studies at a higher school in Karlstadt (Karlovac),Croatia, where the land was low and marshy and where, in consequence, hesuffered repeated bouts with malaria. Yet his illnesses did not prevent him fromconceiving an intense interest in electricity under the stimulating influence ofhis physics professor. Every experiment he saw produced “a thousand echoes” inhis mind, and he longed for experimentation and investigation as a career.When next he returned home, a cholera epidemic was raging, and he immediatelycontracted the disease. He was in bed for nine months, scarcely able to move,and for the second time it was thought he was dying. He remembered that hisfather sat by his bed, trying to cheer him, and that he rallied sufficiently tosuggest, “Perhaps I may get well if you will let me study engineering.” TheReverend Tesla, who had never once relented in his determination that Nikolashould enter the clergy, was now trapped by his own compassion and yielded.What happened next is a little unclear. Apparently Tesla was summoned to servefor three years in the army, a prospect even more repugnant to him than theclergy. But in later life he did not refer to this, saying only that his fatherinsisted he spend a year camping and hiking in the mountains to regain hishealth. In the event, he did spend a year in the latter fashion and did notserve in the army. His father’s family included high-ranking officers, and inall likelihood their influence was employed to formalize his release fromconscription for medical reasons.18[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos895522]His rugged year in the mountains did nothing to subdue his fertile imagination.One plan he conceived was to build a tube under the Atlantic Ocean through whichto shoot mail between the continents. He worked out mathematical details of apumping plant to force water through the tube, which would push the sphericalcontainers of mail. But he failed to gauge accurately the frictional resistanceof the pipe to the flow of water. It appeared to be so great that he was forcedto abandon the plan. Even so, he gained knowledge from this that would beapplied in a later invention.Never one to waste time on trifling schemes, he then conceived of building agargantuan elevated ring around the equator. At first it would have scaffolding.Once this was knocked away the ring would rotate freely at the same speed as theEarth. In this respect it would have had its analogs in the synchronizedsatellites not invented until the late twentieth century. Tesla’s goal, however,was even more ambitious. He proposed next to employ some reactionary force thatwould make the ring hold still with relationship to the Earth. Thus travelerscould climb aboard it and be sped around Earth at a dizzying speed of 1,000miles per hour—or rather, Earth would race beneath them, enabling them to circlethe globe in a day while sitting still.At the end of this magnificent, if impractical, year of wandering and dreaming,he was enrolled in 1875 at the Austrian Polytechnic School in Graz. During hisfirst year he had a fellowship from the Military Frontier Authority and hencehad no financial worries. Nevertheless, he crammed from three in the morninguntil eleven at night, determined to complete two years’ work in one. Physics,mathematics, and mechanics were his main studies.He records that the compulsion to finish everything, once started, almost killedhim when he began reading the works of Voltaire. To his dismay he learned thatthere were close to one hundred volumes in small print “which that monster hadwritten while drinking seventy-two cups of black coffee per diem.” But therecould be no peace for Tesla until he had read them all.At the end of the year he sailed through nine exams with ease. But when hereturned the following year his comfortable financial situation had evaporated.The Military Frontier was being abolished, there would be no fellowship, and thesalary of a clergyman would be unable to cover the high tuition costs. Teslawould thus be obliged to drop out before the school year ended. He made the mostof the little time he had, however, and it was in this second year that he firstbegan to toy with the idea of an alternative to direct-current electricalmachines.The man responsible for introducing Tesla to the fascinations of electricalmachinery was a German, one Professor Poeschl, who taught theoretical andexperimental physics. Although he had “enormous feet and hands like the paws ofa bear,” Tesla found his experiments inspiring. When one day there arrived fromParis a direct-current apparatus called a Gramme Machine that could be used bothas a motor and a dynamo, Tesla examined the machine intently, feeling a strangeexcitement. It had a wire-wound armature with a commutator. While operating, itsparked badly, and Tesla brashly suggested to Professor Poeschl that the designmight be improved by dispensing with the commutator and by switching toalternating current.“Mr. Tesla may accomplish great things,” the German scholar retorted heavily,“but he will never do this. It would be equivalent to converting a steadilypulling force, like that of gravity, into a rotary effort. It is a perpetualmotion machine, an impossible idea.”19[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos895693]The young Serb had no idea how it might be done, but instinct told him that theanswer already lay somewhere in his mind. He knew that he would be unable torest until he had found the solution.But now Tesla’s money had run out. He tried in vain to borrow, and when thisfailed, he began to gamble. Although he was not a very good card player, hebecame almost professionally skillful at billiards.Unfortunately, his newfound skills did not save him. Tesla’s nephew, NikolaTrbojevich, says he was told by other family members that Tesla was “fired” fromthe college and from the city by the police as well “because of playing cardsand leading an irregular life.” The nephew adds: “His mother got the moneytogether for him to go to Prague, as his father would not speak to him. InPrague, where he spent two years, he might have gone to the universityunofficially, but the search made by the Czechoslovak Government shows that hewas not enrolled in any one of the four universities in Czechoslovakia….[I]tappears that Tesla was substantially a self-taught man, which by no meansdetracts from his stature. Faraday also was a self-taught man.”20[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos895855]In 1879 Tesla had tried to find a job in Maribor but was unsuccessful. He wasfinally forced to return home. His father died that same year, and shortlythereafter he returned to Prague in the hope of being able to continue hisstudies. It is believed that until the age of twenty-four he remained there,auditing courses and studying in the library and so keeping abreast of progressin electrical engineering and physics.Probably he continued gambling in an effort to keep in funds, but by this timehe was well free of any danger of becoming an addict. Tesla himself hasdescribed how he became a gambler and then managed to reform. “To sit down to agame of cards,” he recalled, “was for me the quintessence of pleasure. My fatherled an exemplary life and could not excuse the senseless waste of time and moneyin which I indulged…. I would say to him, ‘I can stop whenever I please but isit worthwhile to give up that which I would purchase with the joys of Paradise?’On frequent occasions he gave vent to his anger and contempt, but my mother wasdifferent. She understood the character of men and knew that one’s salvationcould only be brought about through his own efforts. One afternoon, I remember,when I had lost all my money and was craving for a game, she came to me with aroll of bills and said, ‘Go and enjoy yourself. The sooner you lose all wepossess the better it will be. I know that you will get over it.’ She was right.I conquered my passion then and there…. I not only vanquished but tore it frommy heart so as not to leave even a trace of desire….”21[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos896171]Later in life he began to smoke excessively, and also found that the consumptionof coffee was affecting his heart. Willpower triumphed again, and he banishedboth vices. He even stopped drinking tea. Obviously Tesla distinguished betweenthe exercise of free will (which human “meat machines” lacked), and of willpoweror the exercise of determination."},{"pageContent":"3. IMMIGRANTS OF DISTINCTION Telegraphs were in operation in the United States and Europe. The transatlanticcable had been laid. Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone was sweeping theContinent when the news came in 1881 that an exchange would soon be opened atBudapest. It was one of four cities chosen to be so honored by Thomas AlvaEdison’s European subsidiary.Tesla left for Budapest in January of that year. He at once found a job, withthe help of an influential friend of his uncle’s, in the Central TelegraphOffice of the Hungarian government. It was certainly not what the youngelectrical engineer would have chosen, being a drafting position at very lowpay. However, with his usual zest he threw himself into the work.Then he was stricken by a bizarre affliction which, for lack of a better name,his doctors called a nervous breakdown.Tesla’s senses had always been abnormally acute. He claimed that several timesin boyhood he had saved neighbors from fires in their own homes when he wasawakened by the crackling of flames. When he was past forty and carrying on hislightning research in Colorado, he would claim to hear thunderclaps at adistance of 550 miles, although the limit for his young assistants was 150miles.But what happened during his breakdown was astonishing even by Tesla standards.He could hear the ticking of a watch from three rooms away. A fly lighting on atable in his room caused a dull thud in his ear. A carriage passing a few milesaway seemed to shake his whole body. A train whistle twenty miles distant madethe chair on which he sat vibrate so strongly that the pain became unbearable.The ground under his feet was constantly trembling. In order for him to rest,rubber cushions were placed under his bed.“The roaring noises from near and far,” he wrote, “often produced the effect ofspoken words which would have frightened me had I not been able to resolve theminto their accidental components. The sun’s rays, when periodically intercepted,would cause blows of such force on my brain that they would stun me. I had tosummon all my willpower to pass under a bridge or other structure as Iexperienced a crushing pressure on the skull. In the dark I had the sense of abat and could detect the presence of an object at a distance of twelve feet by apeculiar creepy sensation on the forehead.”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos896497]During this period his pulse fluctuated wildly from subnormal to 260 beats perminute. The continuous twitching and trembling of his own flesh became, initself, a nearly unbearable burden.Understandably the medical profession of Budapest was fascinated. A renowneddoctor prescribed large doses of potassium while at the same time pronouncingthe ailment unique and incurable.Tesla writes, “It is my eternal regret that I was not under the observation ofexperts in physiology and psychology at that time. I clung desperately to life,but never expected to recover.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos896668]Yet not only did his health return but, with the assistance of a devoted friend,he soon recovered greater vigor than ever. The friend was Anital Szigety, amaster mechanic with whom Tesla often worked and an athlete. Szigety convincedhim of the importance of exercise and, during this period, the two often wentfor long walks through the city.In the years since he had left the Polytechnic at Graz, Tesla had never ceasedto struggle with the problem of the unsatisfactory direct-current machine. Helater wrote, in his usual flamboyant way, that he did not undertake the problemwith a simple resolve to succeed. “With me it was a sacred vow, a question oflife and death. I knew that I would perish if I failed.”But in fact he already sensed that the battle was won. “Back in the deeprecesses of the brain was the solution, but I could not yet give it outwardexpression.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos896803]One afternoon toward sunset, he and Szigety were walking in the city park, andTesla was reciting Goethe’s Faust. The sinking sun reminded him of a gloriouspassage:> The glow retreats, done in the day of toil;> It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;> Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil,> Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!Then, “the idea came like a flash of lightning, and in an instant the truth wasrevealed.”Tesla’s long, waving arms froze in midair as if he had been seized with a fit.Szigety, alarmed, tried to lead him to a bench, but Tesla would not sit until hehad found a stick. Then he began to draw a diagram in the dust.“See my motor here; watch me reverse it,” he exclaimed.The diagram that he drew would be shown six years later in his address beforethe American Institute of Electrical Engineers, introducing to the world a newscientific principle of stunning simplicity and utility. The applications of itwould literally revolutionize the technical world.It was an entire new system that he had conceived, not just a new motor, forTesla had hit upon the principle of the rotating magnetic field produced by twoor more alternating currents out of step with each other.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos896938]Bycreating, in effect, a magnetic whirlwind produced by the out-of-step currents,he had eliminated both the need for a commutator (the device used for reversingthe direction of an electric current) and for brushes providing passage for thecurrent. He had refuted Professor Poeschl.Other scientists had been trying to invent AC motors but had used only a singlecircuit, just as in direct current, which either would not work or worked badly,churning up a great deal of useless vibration. Alternating currents were beingused to feed arc lights as early as 1878–79 by Elihu Thomson, who built agenerator in the United States. The Europeans, Gaulard and Gibbs, had producedthe first alternating-current transformer, which was necessary for increasingand decreasing voltages in power transmission. George Westinghouse, an earlyadvocate of AC with great plans for the electrification of America, bought theAmerican rights to the Gaulard and Gibbs patents.Yet with all this activity there had been no truly successful AC motor untilTesla invented his—an induction motor that was the heart of a new system and aquantum jump ahead of the times.But of course it is one thing to create a significant invention and quiteanother to make people aware of it. Tesla had already begun to picture himselfas rich and famous, a strong tribute to the power of imagination, since hispaycheck barely sustained him. As he wryly observed, “the last twenty-nine daysof the month were the hardest.” But even hardship now seemed more tolerable forhe knew that at last he could call himself an inventor.“This was the one thing I wanted to be,” he recalled. “Archimedes was my ideal.I admired the works of artists, but to my mind they were only shadows andsemblances. The inventor, I thought, gives the world creations which arepalpable, which live and work.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos897217]In the days that followed he gave himself up entirely to the intense enjoymentof devising new forms of alternating-current machines.“It was a mental state of happiness about as complete as I have ever known inlife,” he was to recall. “Ideas came in an uninterrupted stream, and the onlydifficulty I had was to hold them fast.“The pieces of apparatus I conceived were to me absolutely real and tangible inevery detail, even to the minutest marks and signs of wear. I delighted inimagining the motors constantly running…. When natural inclination develops intoa passionate desire, one advances toward his goal in seven-league boots. In lessthan two months I evolved virtually all the types of motors and modifications ofthe system….”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos897378]He conceived of such practical alternating-current motors as polyphaseinduction, split-phase induction, and polyphase synchronous, as well as thewhole polyphase and single-phase motor system for generating, transmitting, andutilizing electric current. And indeed, practically all electricity in the worldin time would be generated, transmitted, distributed, and turned into mechanicalpower by means of the Tesla Polyphase System.What it signified was vastly higher voltages than could be obtained throughdirect current and—with transmission possible over hundreds of miles—a new ageof electric light and power everywhere. Edison’s carbon filament light bulbcould burn either AC or DC, but electricity couldn’t be carried economicallywhen a generator was required every two miles. And Edison was less adaptablethan his light bulb, being emotionally locked into DC.The year was 1882, and Tesla’s ideas were still raging inside his head. Havingneither the time nor the money for building prototypes, he turned his thoughtsto the work of the telegraph office, where he was soon promoted to engineering.He made several improvements to the central-station apparatus (includinginventing a telephone amplifier which he forgot to patent) and in return, thejob gave him valuable practical experience.Through family friends—two brothers named Puskas—he was next recommended for ajob with Edison’s telephone subsidiary in Paris, where he went in the fall of1882.Of paramount interest to him was to sell the officers of the Continental EdisonCompany on the enormous potential benefits of alternating current. The youngSerb was bitterly disappointed, however, on being told of Edison’s aversion toso much as the mention of this subject.To be young and in Paris simultaneously provided opportunities for consolationthat he did not overlook. He made new friends, both French and American, resumedhis old proficiency at billiards, walked miles every day, and swam in the Seine.At work he was given the job of troubleshooter, to cure the ills of Edison powerplants in France and Germany. Sent to Alsace on a job for the firm, he tookalong materials, and there built his first actual alternating-current inductionmotor—“a crude apparatus, but [it] afforded me the supreme satisfaction ofseeing for the first time, rotation effected by alternating currents withoutcommutator.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos897513]Twice during the summer of 1883 he repeated his experiments with the aid of anassistant. The advantages of AC over Edison’s DC were so obvious to him that hecould not believe anyone could close his eyes to them.In Strassburg, Tesla was asked to see what could be done with a railroad-stationlighting plant that the client, the German government, had refused to accept.And for good reason. A large chunk of wall had been blown out by a short circuitduring the opening ceremony—in the presence of old Emperor William I. The Frenchsubsidiary, being faced with a serious financial loss, promised Tesla a bonus ifhe could improve the dynamos and soothe the Germans.It was a ticklish operation for a relatively inexperienced person, but at leastTesla’s ability to speak German helped. And in the end, not only was he able tocorrect the electrical problems, but he made friends with the mayor, one M.Bauzin, whom he then tried to recruit to support his invention. The mayor did infact round up several wealthy potential investors to whom Tesla demonstrated hisnew motor. But although it functioned perfectly, the burghers simply could notsee its practical advantages.The disappointed young inventor was only partly consoled when the mayor producedsome bottles of St. Estèphe 1801, left over from the last invasion of Alsace bythe Germans. No one, he said kindly, was more worthy of the precious beveragethan Tesla.Having successfully completed his job, the inventor returned to Paris, lookingforward to collecting his bonus. But to his dismay, it did not materialize. Ofthree administrators who were his superiors, each passed the buck to the nextuntil Tesla, angered at being cheated, summarily resigned.8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos897648]The manager of the plant, Charles Batchelor, who had been a close friend andassistant of Edison’s for many years, recognized the young Serb’s abilities. Heurged him to go to America where both grass and currency were greener.Batchelor was an English engineer who had worked with Edison when the latter wasimproving Bell’s first telephone. Edison had invented the transmitter that madeit possible for voices to be heard over long distances, and it was Batchelor whohelped him test the telephone in a boisterous public demonstration, utteringwhat a New York journalist described as “vociferous remarks and thunderoussongs.”Subsequently, the Englishman and Edison together had supervised the installationof Edison’s first commercial self-contained lighting plant on the S.S. Columbia,and the ship had made a brilliant display as she sailed down Delaware Bay on hervoyage around Cape Horn to California.Thus Batchelor had reason to think he knew Edison well, and he wrote Tesla aglowing letter of recommendation, introducing the one egocentric genius to theother. As events would prove, however, Batchelor understood Edison less wellthan he supposed.“I liquefied my modest assets,” Tesla later recalled, “secured accommodationsand found myself at the railroad station as the train was pulling out. At thatmoment I discovered that my money and tickets were gone. What to do? Herculeshad plenty of time to deliberate, but I had to decide while running alongsidethe train with opposite feelings surging in my brain like condenseroscillations. Resolve, helped by dexterity, won out in the nick of time….”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos897783]He found enough change for the train and swung aboard. Later he talked his wayaboard the ship Saturnia when no one showed up to claim his berth.To America, beside the few coins in his pocket, he brought some poems andarticles he had written, a package of calculations relating to what he described(without further elucidation) as an insoluble problem, and drawings for a flyingmachine. To be sure, at twenty-eight he was already one of the world’s greatinventors. But not another soul knew it."},{"pageContent":"4. AT THE COURT OF MR. EDISON At least no one mistook Tesla in his smart bowler hat and black cutaway coat fora Montenegrin shepherd or fugitive from debtors’ prison that June day he strodeashore at the Castle Garden Immigration Office in Manhattan. It was 1884, theyear the people of France gave America the Statue of Liberty. As if in responseto the words of Emma Lazarus, 16 million Europeans and Asians were to sweep intothis country in a very few years, and they would keep coming. Men, women, andeven children were needed as fuel to run America’s fulminating industrialrevolution. It was also the year of the Panic of 1884.Tesla did not go to the Immigration hiring hall, where new arrivals were signedup for labor gangs to slave thirteen-hour days on the railroads, in mines,factories, or stockyards. Instead, with his letter of introduction to Edison andthe address of an acquaintance in his pocket, he asked directions of a policemanand set out boldly onto the streets of New York.Passing a shop where the owner was cursing at a broken machine, he stopped andoffered to fix it. When he had done so, the man was so pleased that he gaveTesla twenty dollars.As he walked on, the young Serb smiled to himself, remembering the joke that hehad heard on shipboard. A Montenegrin shepherd who had just arrived in Americawas walking down the street when he saw a ten-dollar bill. He bent down to pickit up and then stopped, saying to himself, “My first day in America! Why shouldI work?”Thomas Alva Edison, already graying at age thirty-two, buttoned to the chin inone of Mrs. Edison’s hand-sewn, hand-styled, gingham smocks, was an ungainly,swinging, stooping, shuffling figure. At first glance his plain face might haveseemed unremarkable, but it never took visitors long to be impressed by thelight of fierce intelligence and relentless energy that shone in his eyes.At the time, Edison was spread uncomfortably thin, even for a genius. He hadopened the Edison Machine Works on Goerck Street and the Edison Electric LightCompany at 65 Fifth Avenue. His generating station at 255–57 Pearl Street wasserving the whole Wall Street and East River area. And he had a big researchlaboratory at Menlo Park, New Jersey, where a large number of men were employedand where the most astonishing things could happen.Sometimes Edison himself could be seen there, dancing around “a little ironmonster of a locomotive” that got its direct current from a generating stationbehind the laboratory, and which had once flown off the rails at a speed offorty miles per hour to the delight of its creator.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos898083] To thislaboratory, also, Sarah Bernhardt had come to have her voice immortalized onEdison’s phonograph. She had politely remarked upon his resemblance to NapoleonI.The Pearl Street generating station served a few hundred individual mansions ofwealthy New Yorkers with electric lights, but Edison also supplied directcurrent to isolated plants in mills, factories, and theaters all over the city.Also he was getting more and more requests to put lighting plants on ships—aparticular headache since the danger of a fire at sea was a persistentnightmare.And in addition to everything else, he still had to uphold his famous reputationas a man of pithy sayings: “Everybody steals in commerce and industry,” went oneof his apothegms. “I’ve stolen a lot myself. But I know how to steal. They don’tknow how to steal. …” They were Western Union, for whom he had worked while atthe same time selling a competitive invention to their opposition.There was also his contemptuous saying that he didn’t need to be a mathematicianbecause he could always hire them. Formally trained scientists might takeumbrage, but at this particular stage of America’s technological developmentthere was no gainsaying that engineers and inventors probably were making moresignificant contributions to national life than their academic contemporaries.And just so no one would miss the point, Edison liked to add that he couldalways tell the importance of one of his inventions by the number of dollars itbrought and that nothing else concerned him.Julian Hawthorne observed, “If Mr. Edison would quit inventing and go in forfiction, he would make one of the greatest novelists….”On a particularly trying summer day in 1884, the American inventor had rushedstraight from an electrical emergency at the Vanderbilt house on Fifth Avenue tohis Pearl Street generating station. The house had caught fire from two wiresthat got crossed behind wall hangings that contained fine metallic thread. Theflames had been smothered but Mrs. Vanderbilt, hysterical from the ordeal, hadlearned that the source of her problems was a steam engine and boiler in thecellar. Now the unreasonable woman was demanding that Edison remove the wholeinstallation.2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos898279]He dispatched a repair crew, sucked a gulp of cold coffee from a mug, and triedto think what to do next. The telephone rang. Edison tilted the receiver to hisgood ear.The manager of the shipping company that owned the S.S. Oregon sarcasticallydemanded to know if he had any plans for getting the dynamos repaired for hislighting plant. The liner had been tied up for days past sailing time and waslosing bundles of money.What could Edison say? He had no engineer to send.He thought enviously of Morgan. Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan employed a full-timeengineer just to run the private boiler and steam engine that was set into a pitbelow the garden of his Murray Hill mansion. It was so noisy the neighbors werethreatening to sue. But that didn’t bother Morgan; when things got too sticky,he could simply pack a supply of his favorite black cigars and set off for anice long cruise on his yacht, the Corsair.“I’ll send an engineer over this afternoon,” Edison promised the shippingmagnate.Morgan was the major financial backer of the Edison Electric Company, whosedirect-current wires were festooned in localized, horse-frightening,malfunctioning webs above the streets of New York. Although electricity wasstill little understood by the average financier or industrialist, a few likeMorgan could see that it was easily the most promising development to have comealong since Archimedes invented the screw. Everyone needed energy. And sooneveryone would want Edison’s incandescent lights.Electrical engineering was the field for a gifted person of scientific orinventive bent to enter, offering not only financial reward but theseductiveness and danger of an almost unexplored frontier.Cornell University and Columbia College were among the few schools in thecountry to boast fledgling departments of electrical engineering. America hadonly a handful of homegrown experts beyond such giants as Edison, Joseph Henry,and Elihu Thomson. Industrialists therefore would be glad to draw upon theforeign talent pool: Tesla, Michael Pupin, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, Batchelor,and Fritz Lowenstein, among others.Yet it was primarily thanks to Edison’s rough-and-ready ingenuity that thelights were flickering on (and off) in New York City. Only the year before, Mrs.William K. Vanderbilt had staged the epic ball that signaled peace at lastbetween the feuding Astors and the Vanderbilts, and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilthad sailed down the grand staircase of the family mansion dressed as “TheElectric Light,” an apparition in white satin and diamonds that few at the ballwould ever forget.So glamorous was the new energy source that a manufacturer advertised atChristmas urging fathers to “Surprise the whole family with a double socket.”Equally exciting—if puzzling—gifts guaranteeing to put one ahead of the Joneseswere an electric corset for Mom and a magnetic belt for Dad. Yokels at countyfairs were paying for the joy of getting a shock from a storage battery.Edison had no sooner promised his nonexistent engineer to the shipping companyand cradled the telephone receiver that June day than a breathless boy dashedinto the shop to report trouble at Ann and Nassau streets. A junction box thathad been wired by one of the inventor’s inexperienced electricians was leaking.The boy vividly described how a ragman and his horse had been catapulted intothe air and then had disappeared down the street at an unbelievable clip.Edison bellowed for his foreman: “Get a gang of men, if you can find any. Cutoff the current and fix that leak.”He glanced up and became aware of a tall dark presence hovering just inside hisoffice.“Help you, mister?”Tesla introduced himself, speaking in careful accented English and a littlelouder than usual, for he knew of Edison’s hearing problem.“I have this letter from Mr. Batchelor, sir.”“Batchelor, eh? What’s wrong in Paris?”“Nothing that I know of, sir.”“Nonsense, there’s always something wrong in Paris.”Edison read Batchelor’s brief note of recommendation and snorted. But he gaveTesla a penetrating look.“‘I know two great men and you are one of them; the other is this young man!’Hmph! That’s some recommendation. What can you do?”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos898406]Tesla had rehearsed this moment many times on shipboard. Edison’s reputationimpressed him deeply. Here was a man who, without formal education of any sort,had invented hundreds of useful products. He himself had spent years diggingaway at books, but for what? What had he to show for it? What use was all hiseducation?4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos898566]Quickly he began to describe the work he had done for Continental Edison inFrance and Germany. And then, before Edison could even respond, he movedsmoothly into a description of his marvelous induction motor for alternatingcurrent, based upon his discovery of the rotating magnetic field. This was thewave of the future, he said. A smart developer could make a thousand fortuneswith it.“Hold up!” said Edison angrily. “Spare me that nonsense. It’s dangerous. We’reset up for direct current in America. People like it, and it’s all I’ll everfool with. But maybe I could give you a job. Can you fix a ship’s lightingplant?”Tesla boarded the S.S. Oregon that same day with his instruments and began tomake the necessary repairs. The dynamos were in bad condition, having severalshort circuits and breaks. With the aid of the crew he worked through the night.At dawn the next morning the job was finished.As he walked back along Fifth Avenue toward the Edison shop, he met his newemployer and a few of his top men just going home to rest.“Here is our ‘Parisian’ running around at night,” commented Edison.5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos898727]When Tesla said that he had just finished repairing both machines, Edison lookedat him in silence, then walked away without another word. But the Serb with hisacute hearing heard him remark at a little distance, “That is a damn good man.”Edison later told him about another important European scientist’s arrival inthe United States. Charles Proteus Steinmetz, the brilliant German dwarf, wasalmost deported as an indigent alien. He somehow squeaked through and went on tobecome the resident genius of General Electric’s first industrial researchlaboratory at Schenectady. He would later strive to develop an acceptablealternative to Tesla’s alternating-current system when Edison and GeneralElectric needed to play catch-up.Tesla’s skills were quickly appreciated by Edison, who gave him almost completefreedom in working on the design and operating problems of the shop. Heregularly worked from 10:30 in the morning until 5:00 the following morning, aregimen that won from his new boss the grudging comment, “I have had manyhardworking assistants but you take the cake.”Both men had the ability in an emergency to go without sleep for two or threedays while ordinary mortals crumpled around them. Edison’s workers alwaysclaimed, however, that he sneaked catnaps.Before long Tesla observed ways in which the primitive Edison dynamos could bemade to work more efficiently, even though limited to the production of directcurrent. He proposed a plan for redesigning them and said it would not onlyimprove their service but would save a lot of money.The astute businessman in Edison brightened at the mention of the latter, but herealized the project Tesla had described was major and would take a long time.“There’s fifty thousand dollars in it for you—if you can do it,” he said.6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos898862]For months Tesla worked frenziedly, scarcely sleeping from one day to the next.In addition to redesigning the twenty-four dynamos completely and making majorimprovements to them, he installed automatic controls, using an original conceptfor which patents were obtained.The personality differences between the two men doomed their relationship fromthe start. Edison disliked Tesla for being an egghead, a theoretician, andcultured. Ninety-nine percent of genius, according to the Wizard of Menlo Park,was “knowing the things that would not work.” Hence he himself approached eachproblem with an elaborate process of elimination.Of these “empirical dragnets” Tesla later would say amusedly, “If Edison had aneedle to find in a haystack, he would proceed at once with the diligence of thebee to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search. I wasa sorry witness of such doings, knowing that a little theory and calculationwould have saved him ninety percent of his labor.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos899022]The well-known editor and engineer Thomas Commerford Martin recorded thatEdison, unable to find Tesla’s obscure birthplace in Croatia on a map, onceseriously asked him whether he had ever eaten human flesh.“Even the most cometic genius has its orbit,” Martin wisely wrote, “and thesetwo men are singularly representative of different kinds of training, differentmethods, and different strains. Mr. Tesla must needs draw apart … for his ownwork’s sake.”In so basic a matter as personal hygiene they could not have been moredifferent: Tesla, afraid of germs, fastidious in the extreme, once observed ofEdison, “He had no hobby, cared for no sport or amusement of any kind and livedin utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene…. [I]f he had notmarried later a woman of exceptional intelligence, who made it the one object ofher life to preserve him, he would have died many years ago from consequences ofsheer neglect….”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos899188]The irreconcilable differences, however, went beyond personality. Edison sensedthe talented foreigner’s threat to his direct-current system, erroneouslythinking DC was vital to the manufacture and sale of his incandescent lightbulbs. It was the old story of vested interest. At the beginning Edison himselfhad met with violent resistance from the gas monopolies. He had beaten down thegas companies with his natural gift for propaganda, putting out regularbulletins in which he gleefully described the dangers of gas-main explosions.His salesmen were sent out to cover the country, reporting every incident of“industrial oppression” in which workers’ health allegedly had been “injured” bygas heat or their vision damaged by gaslights. Now it looked as if he might haveto lash out against an even newer technology than his own.9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos899352]Tesla, in the odd moments of spare time he could grasp, was absorbing thehistory, literature, and customs of America, relishing new friendships andexperiences. He already spoke English well and was even beginning to understandthe American sense of humor. Or at least he thought he did. As events wouldprove, Edison still had a few things to teach him about that.He enjoyed walking the streets of New York where the new, electrically poweredtrolleys brought congestion and not a little excitement to already jammedthoroughfares. Half the time the central dynamos were broken down. When thetrolleys ran, they scared pedestrians as much as the passengers. The editor of anewspaper solemnly warned that anyone who rode on them might expect to bestricken with palsy and should look for no sympathy.Brooklynites, who for some reason felt especially singled out for attack byvicious trolleys, banded together under the slogan of “Trolley Dodgers.” Later,when the borough acquired a baseball team of its own, it seemed natural to callthem the Brooklyn Dodgers.It took Tesla the better part of the year to finish redesigning Edison’sdynamos. When at last the job was done, he went to his boss to report completesuccess and, not incidentally, to ask when he might receive his $50,000.Edison swept his high black shoes from his desk and fell forward openmouthed.“Tesla,” he exclaimed, “you don’t understand our American humor.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos899501]Once again it seemed that the Serb was to be deliberately cheated by an Edisoncompany. Angered, he announced he would resign. Edison offered a compromise: a$10 raise of his princely salary of $18 per week. Tesla picked up his bowler hatand walked out.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_048.html#filepos1161430]In Edison’s view Tesla was “the poet of science”—his ideas “magnificent bututterly impractical.” He warned the young engineer that he was making amistake—and so it appeared for a time. The country was still deep in the gloomof financial crises with jobs hard to find.Edison, completely in Morgan’s grip, was himself having frustrating financialproblems. While the inventor ached for full-speed-ahead, the banker insisted ona go-slow policy. He denied Edison even the most modest loans for expansionwhile the House of Morgan’s capital was being poured into gigantic railroadacquisitions.The process of “Morganization” had become standardized. Of everything hetouched, the financier soon controlled 51 percent, and he insisted on being onthe board of directors, however anonymously. Morganization meant the steadyacquiring of companies engaged in a similar line of business, the sale ofwatered stock, and the centralizing of power through the elimination of“destructive competition.”Morgan, in his forties and near the peak of his power, was truculent, arrogant,feared, a loner who cared nothing for his associates, his underlings, or thepublic. He was six feet tall, weighed two hundred pounds, and because of anunfortunate skin disease, his nose glowed like one of Edison’s newfangled lightbulbs. Still, such is the power of power, he was a Don Juan whose conquests wereopenly flaunted.11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos899662]His veneer of culture required frequent art-collecting trips to Europe, where hewas more discriminating than many parvenus who amassed the treasures of the OldWorld. A staunch supporter of the Episcopal Church, he often left his WallStreet offices in the afternoon to spend a happy hour booming familiar hymns tothe rafters at St. George’s Episcopal Church, accompanied by his favoriteorganist.Plagued by such evils as railroad rate wars and labor riots that threatened hisrolling stock, he welcomed opportunities to escape from his desk. When travelingin America he rode in a $100,000 “palace car” attached to the train of hischoice. More humble wheels were shunted from his path.Like Edison he was noted for his pithy sayings. One that Tesla would have reasonto recall was: “A man always has two reasons for the things he does—a good oneand the real one.”The financial panic of ’84 had caused such insecurity that thousands of smallinvestors all over America were going broke. Businessmen turned to the powerfulHouse of Morgan, rather than to government, for salvation. It looked to thefinancier as if all his careful plans for the centralizing of control over theeconomic machine might be wrecked by labor troubles and the rate wars among theoverly expanded railroads.It was clear to anyone that far too many railroads had been built forspeculative purposes and that many were facing bankruptcy. There would have tobe a merger. But Morgan was not a man to be pushed or to act rashly. Let hiscompetitors sweat. He would visit the spas of Europe and collect art.By midsummer of the year Tesla arrived in America, Morgan’s leisurely travelshad brought him to England, there to receive still more unpleasant reports fromhome of “railroad wrecking” and panic. Finally he consented to return and puthis formidable brain to work for the sake of the Nation.Morgan’s solution was simply to summon all the quarreling capos to a peaceconference aboard the Corsair.12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos899889] All ofone day he and the captive industrial barons cruised up and down the bay and theEast River. This was no war of individuals but of competing oil, steel, andrailroad interests locked in oligarchic struggle. Before the night fell, Morganhad “reorganized” them all in such a truly masterful way that through clevermergers he had reduced “destructive competition” to a minimum. This was theessence of the Morgan touch, a touch that would soon make itself felt in thepromising new field of electrical utilities.Meanwhile, Tesla, whose engineering reputation was beginning to be favorablyknown, was approached by a group of investors and offered a chance to form acompany under his own name. He leaped at it. At last his greatalternating-current discovery could be presented to the world. Humanity, as hesaw it, would be freed from its burdens. Unfortunately, his backers hadsomething more modest and practical in mind. There was a big market for improvedarc lights for streets and factories, and this would have to come first.The Tesla Electric Light Company was formed, with headquarters at Rahway, NewJersey, and a branch office in New York. One of the men involved in this firmwas James D. Carmen, who was to be a behind-the-scenes ally of Tesla’s fortwenty years or more. He and Joseph H. Hoadley would serve as officers inseveral of Tesla’s companies.Working in his first laboratory on Grand Street, the Serb developed a Tesla arclamp which was more simple, reliable, safe, and economical than those in currentuse.13 [../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos900017]The system was patented and first put to work on the streets of Rahway.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_049.html#filepos1161681]Tesla’s compensation was to have been shares of stock in the firm. Now, to hispainful surprise at the ways of American commerce, he found himself being easedout of the company. He wound up with a handsomely engraved stock certificatewhich, because of the newness of the firm and the recurring economic crises, hadlittle redeemable value.Exit Tesla for the third time.The slump became a depression, and he was unable to find an engineeringposition. From the spring of 1886 until the following year he went through oneof the more depressing periods of his life. Toiling as a laborer on New Yorkstreet gangs, he barely managed to survive. Tesla seldom referred to thispainful experience afterward.Nevertheless he had made some progress: his arc-lighting innovations resulted inthe granting of seven patents, and in addition he obtained other light-relatedpatents, two of which are particularly interesting.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_050.html#filepos1161863] Theyinvolve using the loss of magnetism in iron at temperatures above 750 degreesCelsius, for transforming heat directly into mechanical or electrical energy.Like a number of Tesla’s inventions, they found no immediate use and wereforgotten. But quite recently in the twentieth century a similar process hasgained attention, without recognition being given to Tesla’s prior inventions.Four years had passed since he had discovered the rotating magnetic field andconstructed his first alternating-current motor at Strassburg. He was beginningto wonder whether the green pastures and golden promise of America wouldcontinue to elude him. Humiliated by recent disappointments, he again broodedupon what seemed like his wasted years of education.But then his luck took another unexpected turn. Having heard of his inductionmotor, the foreman of the work crew on which the inventor was suffering sobitterly took him to meet A. K. Brown, manager of the Western Union TelegraphCompany, who not only knew about alternating current but was personallyinterested in the new idea.Where Edison had failed to see the revolution ahead or, more likely, had seen init the death knell of his own direct-current system of electrification, Browncorrectly gauged the future. With his help another company was created inTesla’s name. The Tesla Electric Company had the specific goal of at lastdeveloping the alternating-current system that the inventor had conceived in thepark in Budapest in 1882.14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos900240]"},{"pageContent":"5. THE WAR OF THE CURRENTS BEGINS The laboratory and shops that the ecstatic Tesla found for his new company wereat 33–35 South Fifth Street, only blocks from the Edison workshops. The TeslaElectric Company, capitalized with half a million dollars, opened for businessin April 1887. To the inventor, who had waited so long for this moment, it wasthe fulfillment of a dream. He began laboring like one of his own dynamos, dayand night without rest.Because it was all there in his mind he needed only a few months to start filingpatent applications for the entire polyphase AC system. This was in fact threecomplete systems for single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase alternatingcurrents. He experimented with other kinds too. And for each type he producedthe necessary dynamos, motors, transformers, and automatic controls.Hundreds of central stations were operating in America at this time, using atleast twenty different combinations of circuits and equipment. Usually thesewere centered upon one invention or group of them. Thus Elihu Thomson hadinstalled a small alternator and transformers in the factory of theThomson-Houston Company at Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1886, supplying incandescentlamps in another factory. But it was to be another year before he evolved a safesystem for wiring houses. So, too, George Westinghouse, inventor of the railroadair brake, having acquired patents to the AC distribution system of Gaulard andGibbs, set his chief engineer, William Stanley, to building a transformersystem. It was successfully tested in 1886. Westinghouse operated the firstcommercial AC system in America at Buffalo in November of that year and by 1887had more than thirty plants in operation. In addition there was of course thedirect-current system of the Edison Electric Company, one of the earliestcontenders in the field.But still no satisfactory alternating-current motor existed. Within six monthsafter opening his shop, Tesla sent two motors to the Patent Office for testingand filed his first AC patents.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_051.html#filepos1162115] Inall, through 1891, he applied for and was granted a total of forty patents.†[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_052.html#filepos1162394] Sooriginal and sweeping were they that he met with no delay.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos900570]And now, recognition was mercifully swift in coming. William A. Anthony, who hadestablished a course in electrical engineering at Cornell University, saw thesignificance of the Tesla system at once and spoke out in its favor. This wasnot just a new motor but quite possibly the foundation of a new technology. Theessence of the system, as Anthony noted, was the beautifully simple inductionmotor, which had almost no wearing parts to break down.The news of such unheralded activity in the U.S. Patent Office rocked WallStreet as well as the industrial and academic worlds. At Professor Anthony’ssuggestion the almost unknown young Serb was invited to lecture to the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers on May 16, 1888.Tesla, to his surprise, discovered himself to be a natural and brilliantlecturer; and his address became a classic. His subject was “A New System ofAlternate Current Motors and Transformers.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos900861]Dr. B. A. Behrend, commenting on the presentation, said, “Not since theappearance of Faraday’s ‘Experimental Researches in Electricity’ has a greatexperimental truth been voiced so simply and so clearly…. He left nothing to bedone by those who followed him. His paper contained the skeleton even of themathematical theory.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos901021]Tesla’s timing could not have been better. His patents were the missing key thatGeorge Westinghouse had been waiting for. The Pittsburgh magnate, a stocky,blunt, dynamic fellow with a walrus mustache, had a taste for fashionable dressand for adventure. Like Morgan he would soon be commuting in his private railwaycar—at first from Pittsburgh to New York but finally to Niagara Falls. In hisreputation as a plunger, Westinghouse somewhat resembled Edison. And like Edisonhe was a fighter. The two men were to be well-matched in the battles ahead.Westinghouse was a hard-driving businessman but he was the antithesis of arobber baron: he did not see the buying up of politicians and the fleecing ofthe public as essential to success in business. What he did see, what he hadappreciated from the very first, was the potential of a power system that couldsend currents of high voltage surging across the great spaces of America. LikeTesla he had even dreamed of harnessing the hydroelectric potential of NiagaraFalls.He called on the inventor in his laboratory. The two men, who shared both theromance of the new energy and a taste for personal dandiness, felt a quickrapport. Tesla’s workshops and laboratory were crammed with intriguingapparatus. Westinghouse moved from machine to machine, sometimes bent forward,hands on knees, peering, or sometimes with his head tilted, nodding withpleasure at the smooth hum of alternating-current motors. He needed fewexplanations.There is a story, unfortunately without documentation, that he then turned toTesla and offered him $1 million plus a royalty for all of his AC patents. Ifever made, the offer must have been declined, for the records show that for hisforty patents Tesla received about $60,000 from the Westinghouse firm, whichincluded $5,000 in cash and 150 shares of stock. Significantly, however,according to Westinghouse historical records, he was to earn $2.50 perhorsepower of electricity sold.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_053.html#filepos1162864] Withina few years these royalties would be worth such a stupendous amount of moneythat they would pose a curious problem.For the present, however, since the monies received by Tesla had to be sharedwith Brown and other investors in his firm, he was far from having joined thesuper-rich. Nevertheless his transition from threadbare to fashionable in thesocial circles of Manhattan was both agreeable and slightly dizzying.He agreed to work as a consultant for Westinghouse in adapting his single-phasesystem, at a salary of $2,000 per month. While the extra income was welcome, itmeant moving to Pittsburgh just as exciting social invitations had begun totrickle in from members of the New York “400.” He left reluctantly.As might have been anticipated with a completely new system, difficulties layahead. The 133-cycle current then used by Westinghouse was wrong for Tesla’sinduction motor, which was built to 60 cycles. When he so informed theengineers, he succeeded in rubbing them the wrong way and only after months offutile and costly experiments doing it their way did they finally accept hisword. Once they had done so, the motor worked exactly as it had been designed todo. Sixty cycles has ever since been the standard for alternating current.Tesla soon achieved another milestone as important to him as the development ofhis inventions. On July 30, 1891, he became an American citizen. This, as heoften told friends, he valued more than any of the scientific honors to come tohim. Honorary degrees he tossed into drawers, but his certificate ofnaturalization was always kept in his office safe.After several months he finished his duties in Pittsburgh and returned to NewYork, feeling physically and mentally exhausted. To a large extent he felt thosemonths wasted since they had kept him from moving ahead with new research.In September he left for Paris to attend the International Exposition and, fromthere, in the company of his uncle Petar Mandić, departed for Croatia. Petar hadonce been a monk in the monastery of Gomirje near Ogulin, and here the exhaustedinventor went to recover his health.He then visited his sisters and mother. Of the circumstances in which hiswidowed mother then lived or whether he ever contributed to her support once hebegan to earn money in America, unfortunately no records have been found. Thatshe often dominated his thoughts, however, future events were to disclose.Edison felt a flood of outrage when he first heard the news of Tesla’s deal withWestinghouse for his alternating-current system. At last the lines were clearlydrawn. Soon his propaganda machine at Menlo Park began grinding out a barrage ofalarmist material about the alleged dangers of alternating current.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos901274] AsEdison saw it, accidents caused by AC must, if they could not be found, bemanufactured, and the public alerted to the hazards. Not only were fortunes atstake in the War of the Currents but also the personal pride of an egocentricgenius.By now the bad times had turned to boom. The country was expansion-minded. Therewere steelworks in Pittsburgh, a new Brooklyn Bridge, towers reaching toward thesky above Manhattan. Railroads, land, and gold were making fortunes for thosewho speculated in growth at the right time. Edison himself had become one of theleading industrialists in America, employing almost 3,000 workers at his variousplants.Michael Pupin, who later joined with Edison and Marconi to form a damagingtrinity against his fellow Serb, was among those who immediately saw thesuperiority of Tesla’s AC system. In fact he claimed that he came near to beingfired from the electrical-engineering faculty at Columbia University for“eulogizing” this new technology.Pupin, a farm boy who had grown up on the military frontier of Serbia, hadarrived in New York at the age of fifteen with a nickel in his pocket (one centmore than Tesla), had shoveled coal for fifty cents a ton, and later wonscholarships to Columbia University and Cambridge. Like Tesla he became one ofAmerica’s greatest physicists and electrical engineers.But it disturbed Pupin that the captains of the electrical industry were payingso little attention to highly trained electrical experts. All they seemed toworry about, he charged, was that their direct-current systems would not besupplanted by alternating current.“A most un-American mental attitude!” said this new American. “It was clear toevery impartial and intelligent expert that the two systems supplemented eachother in a most admirable manner.”The patents held by Westinghouse were challenged by a number of litigants,primarily rival manufacturers claiming that their inventors had anticipatedTesla. Suits were filed in behalf of the inventors Walter Baily, Marcel Deprez,and Charles S. Bradley. In addition, in an attempt to evade the Tesla patents,General Electric filed an application for what was called the “monocyclic”system of their brilliant mathematician, Charles Steinmetz. Steinmetz himself,however, never questioned Tesla’s preeminence in the AC field.Such actions confused the public, and even some members of the engineeringprofession never clearly understood that the system almost universally adoptedwas Tesla’s. This confusion is, to some extent, still true, despite the sweepingand eloquent ruling in Tesla’s favor issued in September 1900 by Judge Townsendof the U.S. Circuit Court of Connecticut. If for no other reason than that,Judge Townsend’s words are worth quoting here:> It remained to the genius of Tesla to capture the unruly, unrestrained and> hitherto opposing elements in the field of nature and art and to harness them> to draw the machines of man. It was he who first showed how to transform the> toy of Arago into an engine of power; the “laboratory experiment” of Baily> into a practically successful motor; the indicator into a driver; he first> conceived the idea that the very impediments of reversal in direction, the> contradictions of alternations might be transformed into power-producing> rotations, a whirling field of force.> What others looked upon as only invincible barriers, impassable currents and> contradictory forces he seized, and by harmonizing their directions utilized> in practical motors in distant cities the power of Niagara.> A decree may be entered for an injunction and an accounting as to all the> claims in suit.At West Orange, New Jersey, families living in the neighborhood of Edison’s hugelaboratory began to notice that their pets were vanishing. Soon they found outwhy. Edison was paying schoolboys twenty-five cents a head for dogs and cats,which he then electrocuted in deliberately crude experiments with alternatingcurrent. At the same time he issued scare leaflets with the word “WARNING!” inred letters at the top. The gist of these messages: if the public were notalert, they might find themselves being terminally “Westinghoused.”Edison had been laying the groundwork for his vendetta for two years. He hadwritten to E. H. Johnson: “Just as certain as death Westinghouse will kill acustomer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got anew thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it workingpractically. It will never be free from danger….”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos901423]Now he was accusing Westinghouse of doing what he himself had done to the gascompanies when he sent agents around the country propagandizing the virtues ofdirect current: “None of his plans worry me in the least; only thing thatdisturbs me is that W. is a great man for flooding the country with agents andtravelers. He is ubiquitous and will form numerous companies before we knowanything about it….”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos901559]Westinghouse, his eyes on the challenges ahead, paid only reluctant attention toEdison’s hectoring but at last he agreed to carry on an educational campaign tocombat it. He would make speeches, he said; he would write articles; he would doanything to get the truth before the people. He was, he told Tesla, determinedto win for his company the right to harness Niagara Falls.He also had his eye on Chicago and the Columbian Exposition to be held there in1893. Planners were already beginning to speak of this event—commemorating the400th anniversary of America’s discovery— as the World of Tomorrow, the WhiteCity that would light up the land. He could not have asked for a bettershowcase.Unfortunately, Lord Kelvin, the famous English scientist, had been namedchairman of the International Niagara Commission established to choose the bestmeans of harnessing the Falls, and Kelvin had declared himself squarely on theside of old-fashioned direct current.When the commission offered a prize of $3,000 for the most practicable plan,about twenty were submitted. But the Big Three electrical companies,Westinghouse, Edison General Electric, and Thomson-Houston, elected not toparticipate. The commission had been set up by a New York group called theCataract Construction Company, the president of which was Edward Dean Adams. AsWestinghouse saw it, this firm was “trying to get one hundred thousand dollars’worth of information for three thousand dollars.” When they were “ready to talkbusiness,” he said, he would submit his plans.As usual in these years of rapid growth, George Westinghouse had money problems.It had cost a great deal more than he had expected to convert his plants over tothe Tesla polyphase system. And now when he needed funds for expansion, thebankers were giving him mingy responses.His only consolation was knowing that Edison was in trouble too. The rumors onWall Street were that, unless Edison consolidated, his problems were acute. Totake his mind off them, he blustered. Westinghouse, he said, should stick withhis air brakes, for he knew nothing about the electricity business.Edison’s opening feint in the War of the Currents was to lobby legislators atAlbany to pass a law limiting electrical currents to 800 volts. That way, hefigured, AC would be stopped. But the legislators didn’t buy it sinceWestinghouse countered with a threat to sue the Edison firm and others forconspiracy under the laws of the State of New York.“The man has gone crazy,” ranted Edison of his nemesis in Pittsburgh, “and isflying a kite that will land him in the mud sooner or later.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos901695]In addition to waging a virulent campaign in press, pamphlet, and by word ofmouth, Edison initiated Saturday demonstrations for newspaper reporters withstrong stomachs. He called them in to witness the frightened dogs and cats thatschoolboys had snatched off the streets being shoved onto a sheet of metal towhich were attached wires from an AC generator with a current of one thousandvolts.8 [../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos901831]Batchelor sometimes helped with these demonstrations of the perils ofalternating current. Once while trying to hold a wriggling puppy, he himselfreceived a terrible shock. He described having “the awful memory of body andsoul being wrenched asunder … the sensations of an immense rough file thrustthrough the quivering fibres of the body.” Still the killing of animalscontinued.Edison was in this fight literally to the death, although not his own. He,Samuel Insull, and a former laboratory assistant named Harold P. Brown workedout a scheme to finish Westinghouse once and for all, or so they thought—throughthe death of a third party.Brown managed by subterfuge to buy a license to use three of the Tesla ACpatents without Westinghouse knowing of their intended purpose. Brown then madea trip to Sing Sing Prison. Shortly afterward the prison authorities announcedthat the death house would carry out future executions not by hanging but byelectrocution, and more specifically by alternating current, courtesy of theWestinghouse patents.Prior to the next execution “Professor” Brown went on the road with Edison’straveling show. On stage he electrocuted a number of calves and large dogs withAC and referred to having “Westinghoused” them. In effect he was askingAmericans, “Is this the invention you want your little wife to cook dinnerwith?”Public concern had been fired to the desired pitch when New York State prisonauthorities announced the first scheduled electrocution of a condemned murderer.One William Kemmler would die on August 6, 1890—Westinghoused.Kemmler was strapped into the electric chair and the switch thrown. But Edison’sengineers, all their experiments having been with smaller creatures, had erred.The electric charge was too weak, and the condemned man was only half-killed.The dreadful procedure then had to be repeated. A reporter described it as “anawful spectacle, far worse than hanging.”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos901967]Westinghouse through the long, sordid campaign doggedly continued to try to setthe public straight about AC, citing facts and figures to support its safety.Luckily he had prestigious help from Professor Anthony at Cornell, ProfessorPupin at Columbia, and other respected scientists.Edison’s associates eventually began to sense that the tide might be turning andtried to convince the great inventor that, from the standpoint of his ownindustrial future, he was making a monumental mistake. But stubbornness was oneof his weaknesses, and he refused to see it. It would be twenty years before hewould admit that this had been his greatest blunder. After all, one of hisfavorite sayings was: “I don’t care so much for a fortune… as I do for gettingahead of the other fellow.”But long before Edison was prepared to admit scientific error, it was borne inon him that his priorities must be revised. His financial difficulties had grownextreme, and a merger seemed almost inevitable.The Thomson-Houston Company provided an object lesson when it was taken over bythe House of Morgan and placed under the direction of a professional managernamed Charles A. Coffin. An apt student of J. Pierpont Morgan, Coffin wagedprice wars against his competitors and then, once they were weak, wheedled theminto lethal mergers. Along the way, Thomson and Houston lost control of theirfirm.As Westinghouse later described an interview with Coffin to Clarence W. Barron:“He [Coffin] told me how he ran his stock down and deprived both Thomson andHouston of the benefits of an increased stock issue. He was enabled, by thedecline in stock which he had forced, to make a new contract with both Thomsonand Houston, by which they waived their rights to take new stock in proportionto their holdings under their agreement with the Company.“I said to Coffin, ‘You tell me how you treated Thomson and Houston; why shouldI trust you…?’”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos902103]Edison, however, was not granted the luxury of deciding whether he trustedCoffin. On February 17, 1892, The Electrical Engineerannounced a consolidationof the Edison Electric Company and the Thomson-Houston Company, with none of thefounders’ names in the new title. Henceforth the new firm would be calledGeneral Electric Company, with Coffin as its president.> In the same article The Electrical Engineer has written:> It seems quite reasonable to expect, as many do, and as rumor has it, that> absorption of the Westinghouse Company into the proposed new corporation will> soon follow. The provision of $16,600,000 of stock—$6,000,000 of which is in> preferred shares—remaining to the treasury after taking up the Edison and> Thomson-Houston stocks, is thought by many to imply the use of a considerable> portion of it in taking over the Westinghouse Company when convenient; but no> definite information of such a plan has been made public.In short, Morgan was close to realizing his ambition of controlling the futureelectrification of America, both AC and DC, through the elimination of “costlycompetition.” He meant to use the same tactics that had worked so well incentralizing the control of the railroads, of oil, coal, and steel. Clearly, thebest growth investments of the future would be in controlling the manufacture ofall electrical appliances and machinery and providing the related services thateventually would become known as “public utilities.” But to do this he wouldneed the Tesla patents.Coffin, in his reckless interview with Westinghouse, had revealed that he hadbeen “cutting prices fearfully” in order to “knock out” other electrical firms.The important thing, he advised, man-to-man, was to get one’s own systeminstalled before the competition did so, whether it be for running electrictrolleys or whatever; after that, any changes would be prohibitively expensive.“The users willingly pay our price as they cannot afford to change the system,”he exulted.11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos902264] He hadbeen talking to precisely the wrong person, however, for Westinghouse wascommitted to proving that a superior system could indeed knock out an entrenchedbut inferior one.Coffin had spoken earnestly of the advantages of “boodle.” He had askedWestinghouse to raise the price of his street lights from $6 to $8, as his ownfirm had done, since this would enable him to pay $2 in boodle to the aldermenand other politicians without losing a cent of profit.12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos902392] Butwhen it became clear that Westinghouse was not to be a willing partner to hisown demise, General Electric Company and the House of Morgan turned upon himwhere he was most vulnerable, in the money markets.“From all the stock-market sub-cellars and rat-holes of State, Broad, and Wallstreets crept those wriggling, slimy snakes of bastard rumors,” wrote ThomasLawson in Frenzied Finance. “‘George Westinghouse has mismanaged his companies …George Westinghouse … is involved beyond extrication unless by consolidationwith the General Electric….’ There came a crash in the Westinghouse stocks.”Lawson reports that he himself was called in as “an expert in stock marketaffairs” to assist Westinghouse, and that he drove a heroic bargain. First,there must be a consolidation of some sort. Westinghouse was indeed overextendedin his drive to put the country on an alternating-current system.The financial advisers arranged a merger with several smaller companiesincluding U.S. Electric Company and the Consolidated Electric Light Company. Thenew firm would be known as the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company.So far, so good, but there was one problem: Nikola Tesla’s patent royaltiesunder the generous arrangement with Westinghouse would sink any ship, accordingto the investment bankers. One source has stated he was told by Tesla thatWestinghouse had paid him $1 million in advance royalties.13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos902520] Onlyfour years after the contract was signed, it was rumored that the accruedroyalties could be in the neighborhood of $12 million. No one seemed to knowexactly, least of all Tesla. As utilities expanded, royalties would be collectedon powerhouse equipment and motors and on every application of thealternating-current system patents. Tesla stood to become a billionaire, one ofthe world’s wealthiest men.“Get rid of that royalty contract, Westinghouse,” the investment banker advised.Otherwise the stability of the reorganization would be emperiled.This Westinghouse was loath to do. He himself was an inventor and believed inroyalties. Besides, he argued, royalties were paid for by the customers andincluded in costs of production. But the bankers left him with no choice.Reluctantly he called on the inventor in what must have been one of the mostembarrassing confrontations of his life. (In the official biography of GeorgeWestinghouse the episode goes unmentioned.) The contract between Tesla andWestinghouse had been made in good faith on the part of both men. Tesla, had hechosen, undoubtedly could have gone to court and had it upheld. But to what endif Westinghouse were to lose his firm?As usual, George Westinghouse went directly to the point. Explaining theproblem, he said, “Your decision determines the fate of the WestinghouseCompany.”14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos902681]Tesla’s absorption in his new fields of research had been total. Money wassomething he spent freely when he had it, but he seldom knew how much wasavailable. To him the value of money consisted in what one did with it ratherthan in any intrinsic worth.“Suppose,” he asked, “I should refuse to give up my contract; what would you dothen?”Westinghouse spread his hands. “In that event you would have to deal with thebankers, for I would no longer have any power in the situation.”“And if I give up the contract, you will save your company and retain control?You will proceed with your plans to give my polyphase system to the world?”“I believe your polyphase system is the greatest discovery in the field ofelectricity,” said Westinghouse. “It was my efforts to make it available to theworld that brought on the present difficulty. But I intend to continue, nomatter what happens, with my original plans to put the country on analternating-current basis.”Being no businessman, Tesla could not refute Westinghouse’s assessment of hisfinancial situation; but he trusted the industrialist. “Mr. Westinghouse,” hesaid, “you have been my friend, you believed in me when others had no faith; youwere brave enough to go ahead… when others lacked courage; you supported me wheneven your own engineers lacked vision to see the big things ahead that you and Isaw; you have stood by me as a friend…. You will save your company so that youcan develop my inventions. Here is your contract and here is my contract—I willtear both of them to pieces, and you will no longer have any troubles from myroyalties. Is that sufficient?”15[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos902817]The Westinghouse Company’s annual report of 1897 states that Tesla was paid$216,600 for outright purchase of his patents at this point to avoid the paymentof royalties.By destroying the contract, Tesla not only relinquished his claim to millions ofdollars in already earned royalties but to all that would have accrued in thefuture. In the industrial milieu of that or any other time it was an act ofunprecedented generosity if not foolhardiness. He was to live well for anotherdecade but thereafter would be plagued by a chronic shortage of research anddevelopmental capital. How many discoveries were thus to be lost to society canonly be surmised.Westinghouse returned to Pittsburgh, where the mergers and refinancing werearranged. His company went on to become a giant, and he kept his promise toTesla. Years later in a formal testimonial to the industrialist, Tesla wrote:“George Westinghouse was, in my opinion, the only man on this globe who couldtake my alternating-current system under the circumstances then existing and winthe battle against prejudice and money power. He was a pioneer of imposingstature, one of the world’s true noblemen of whom America may well be proud andto whom humanity owes an immense debt of gratitude.”16[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos902953]Tesla had returned from his months in Pittsburgh depressed not only by hisdisagreements with the Westinghouse engineers but because of several lawsuitsjust beginning over his alternating-current inventions.“Hundreds of electrical manufacturers pirated the Tesla patents,” John J.O’Neill noted in a private communication, “and when Westinghouse had themcompletely upheld in the courts and smashed down on the trespassers, all of thehate of the losers was vented on Tesla.”Some attacks went beyond simple piracy. Claims were advanced in behalf ofProfessor Galileo Ferraris of the University of Turin as the first to havedescribed a method of producing a revolving magnetic field. He apparently hadgiven some thought to the problem in 1885 but had made no progress. Tesla, bycomparison, had made his discovery of the rotating magnetic field in 1882 andwithin two months had evolved the complete system, which included all theapparatus he later patented. He had actually built his first induction motor.Ferraris, however, had concluded that the principle could never be used formaking a practical motor.He nevertheless had been publicized by The Electrician in London as the man mostlikely to invent one. When the editors learned of Tesla’s invention, theyerroneously assumed and reported that he had been inspired by the concept ofFerraris.Because of the vicious rivalry between Edison and Westinghouse, the formerfaction seized on any opportunity to smear Tesla. The specious argument overFerraris seemed as good an excuse as any.Two prominent immigrants (although they would later be allied with the Edisoncamp) rose at once to Tesla’s defense. Steinmetz, in a paper for the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers, said: “Ferraris built only a little toy, andhis magnetic circuits, so far as I know, were completed in air, not in iron,though that hardly makes any difference.”As for Professor Michael Pupin, he wrote to Tesla: “The Ferraris humbug has beenindulged in by your competitors to a disgraceful extent. As I understand itthere is a gigantic step from Ferraris’ whirling pool to Tesla’s whirlingmagnetic field. The two things seem to me radically different and ought to bepointed out and shown in their true lights….”17[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos903173]Tesla, deep in his research, was scarcely aware of the corrosive antagonismsraging around his inventions. He was immersed in a whole new world of electricalphenomena.Westinghouse, meanwhile, when he was not testifying or speechifying, wasaggressively extending the front lines of his industrial domain. Out in thelittle mining town of Telluride, Colorado, the first commercial use was made ofTesla motors and generators built by Westinghouse. They were installed in 1891to furnish electricity for the mining camps.18[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos903374]"},{"pageContent":"6. ORDER OF THE FLAMING SWORD As long as the world left him alone in his Manhattan laboratory to pursue hislove affair with electricity, Tesla was the happiest man alive. In the waningyears of the 1880s and the early 1890s he had enjoyed such a brief period. Butwhen he delivered four blockbusting lectures in America and Europe in 1891–92,he became, in a matter of months, the world’s most celebrated scientist, and hisprivate life was never the same again.A weird, storklike figure on the lecture platform in his white tie and tails, hewas nearly seven feet tall, for he wore thick cork soles during his dangerousdemonstrations. As he warmed to his act, his high-pitched, almost falsetto voicewould rise in excitement. The audience, riveted by the cadenced flow of words,the play of lights and magic, would stare as in a trance.The language of science then being completely inadequate, Tesla described visualeffects in the style of a poet in love with the sheer dance of flame and light.Indeed it seemed as if these were as significant to him as tapping the energywithin. Yet no scientist could fault him on technical details.Despite the fireworks, philosophy, and poetry, his every scientific claim wasbased on experiments he had personally repeated at least twenty times. Each itemof equipment was new, designed by him and usually fabricated in his own shop.The same demonstration was seldom repeated from one appearance to another.As to the inadequacy of the scientific terminology of his day—the luminousfeathery discharge of electricity in a vacuum tube that he referred to in hislectures as a brush was in fact a beam of electrons and ionized gas molecules.He did not say, “Now I shall describe the cyclotron,” for the word wasnonexistent; but what he would describe and what he would demonstrate wasthought by some who were knowledgeable to have been an early ancestor of theatom smasher.Nor did he say, “Now I shall describe the point electron microscope. Now I shalldescribe cosmic rays. Now I shall describe the radio vacuum tube. Now I shalldescribe X ray.” When he described a vacuum bulb which turned out to be theforerunner of the Audion, radio was called wireless, and wireless was scarcelyin its infancy. When he described blurred photographic plates in his laboratory,and visible and invisible light, not even Roentgen knew what X rays were ormight be used for. And when Tesla created a flame that he described as “burningwithout consuming material or even a chemical reaction,” he probably wasventuring into plasma physics.“Phenomena upon which we used to look as wonders baffling explanation, we nowsee in a different light,” he told the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers. “The spark of an induction coil, the glow of an incandescent lamp,the manifestations of the mechanical forces of currents and magnets are nolonger beyond our grasp; instead of the incomprehensible, as before, theirobservation suggests now in our minds a simple mechanism, and although as to itsprecise nature all is still conjecture, yet we know that the truth cannot bemuch longer hidden, and instinctively we feel that the understanding is dawningupon us. We still admire these beautiful phenomena, these strange forces, but weare helpless no longer….”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos903698]He spoke of the mysterious fascination of electricity and magnetism, “with theirseemingly dual character, unique among the forces in nature, with theirphenomena of attractions, repulsions, and rotations, [their] strangemanifestations of mysterious agents,” that stimulate and excite the mind.But how to explain them?“An infinitesimal world, with the molecules and their atoms spinning and movingin orbits, in much the same manner as celestial bodies, carrying with them andprobably spinning with them ether, or in other words, carrying with them staticcharges,” he said, “seems to my mind the most probable view, and one which, in aplausible manner, accounts for most of the phenomena observed. The spinning ofthe molecules and their ether sets up the ether tensions or electrostaticstrains; the equalization of ether tensions sets up other motions or electriccurrents, and the orbital movements produce the effects of electro and permanentmagnetism.”It had been only three years since, speaking before this same professionalgroup, he had introduced the power system that was to revolutionize industry andbring light to even the most remote homes. Now he described his research intothe very nature of electricity by way of light and luminous effects, holding hisaudience in thrall.The stage from which he spoke was illuminated with stunning displays ofgas-filled tube lights, some of which had been made phosphorescent to enhancetheir brilliance and for some of which he used uranium glass. They were theforerunners of today’s fluorescent lights. Tesla never patented orcommercialized them, and they did not appear on the market until fifty yearslater. For his lecture, characteristically, he had twisted the tubes intonames—not only those of great scientists but of his favorite Serbian poets.Turning to a table, the spellbinder carefully selected a delicate prop. “Here isa simple glass tube from which the air has been partially exhausted,” he said.“I take hold of it; I bring my body in contact with a wire conveying alternatingcurrents of high potential, and the tube in my hand is brilliantly lighted. Inwhatever position I may put it, wherever I move it in space, as far as I canreach, its soft, pleasing light persists with undiminished brightness.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos903949]As the tube he held began to glow—demonstrating among other things a politicalmessage about the safety of alternating current— “Professor” Brown, the Edisonagent, arose unnoticed and hurried from the hall. His boss would chew nails whenhe heard about this razzle-dazzle. But George Westinghouse, who had come fromPittsburgh just to hear the lecture, leaned forward, shook his head, and smiled.Tesla next revealed his wireless or electrodeless discharge lamps inductivelycoupled to a high-frequency power supply, which he had invented afterdiscovering that gases at reduced pressure exhibited extremely highconductivity. These, as he showed, could be moved anywhere in the room yet wouldeerily continue to burn. He would never get around to making them practicablefor commercial use, but they are still being investigated more than eighty yearslater, as shown by patents recently issued.Roland J. Morin, the chief engineer of Sylvania GTE International, New York,later wrote: “I am sure that [Tesla’s] demonstration of these light sources atthe Chicago World’s Fair [1893] stimulated D. McFarlan Moore to develop andannounce commercial realization of the fluorescent lamp….”Gracious in paying tribute to scientists who had paved the way, Tesla expressedhis debt to Sir William Crookes, who in the 1870s had built a vacuum tube with apair of electrodes inside. Alluding to “that same vague world” (later identifiedas a stream of electrons), he spoke of the effects obtained with alternatingcurrents of high voltage and frequency: “We observe how the energy of analternating current traversing the wire manifests itself—not so much in thewires as in the surrounding space—in the most surprising manner, taking theforms of heat, light, mechanical energy and, most surprising of all, evenchemical affinity.”His long fingers deftly chose another prop.“Here is an exhausted bulb suspending from a single wire…. I grasp it, and aplatinum button mounted in it is brought to vivid incandescence.“Here, attached to a leading wire, is another bulb which, as I touch itsmetallic socket, is filled with magnificent colors of phosphorescent light.“Here again,” he said, “insulated as I stand on this platform, I bring my bodyin contact with one of the terminals of the secondary of this induction coil…and you see streams of light break forth from its distant end, which is set inviolent vibration….“Once more, I attach these two plates of wire gauze to the terminals of thecoil. [T]he passage of the discharge… assumes the form of luminous streams.”It was impossible with an induction coil, he said, to pursue any novelinvestigation without coming upon some interesting or useful fact. He began todescribe effects he had achieved in the laboratory—“large pinwheels, which inthe dark present a beautiful appearance owing to the abundance of the streams,”and of how he had sought to produce “a queer flame which would be rigid.”To his listeners it sometimes seemed as if visual excitement were as importantto him as useful results; but then, in the next breath he would present them one“useful fact” after another.For example, he showed them a motor that ran on only one wire, the returncircuit occurring wirelessly through space. And, renewing his spell over men whoprided themselves on common sense and resistance to flimflammery, he spoke ofthe possibility of running motors without any wires at all. He spoke of energyin space, free for the taking.“It is quite possible,” he said, “that such ‘no-wire’ motors, as they might becalled, could be operated by conduction through the rarefied air at considerabledistances. Alternating currents, especially of high frequencies, pass withastonishing freedom through even slightly rarefied gases. The upper strata ofthe air are rarefied. To reach a number of miles out into space requires theovercoming of difficulties of a merely mechanical nature. There is no doubt thatwith the enormous potentials obtainable by the use of high frequencies and oilinsulation, luminous discharges might be passed through many miles of rarefiedair, and that, by thus directing the energy of many hundreds of thousands ofhorsepower, motors, or lamps might be operated at considerable distance fromstationary sources. But such schemes are mentioned merely as possibilities. Weshall have no need to transmit power in this way. We shall have no need totransmit power at all. Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be drivenby a power obtainable at any point of the universe. This idea is not novel…. Wefind it in the delightful myth of Antaeus, who derives power from the earth; wefind it among the subtle speculations of one of your splendid mathematicians….Throughout space there is energy. Is this energy static or kinetic? If static,our hopes are in vain; if kinetic—and this we know it is, for certain—then it isa mere question of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery tothe very wheelwork of nature….”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos904223]The star exhibit of Tesla’s show, however (to be elaborated on in his laterlectures in England and France), was a single six-inch almost empty vacuum tubethat he called the carbon-button lamp. With this research tool he explored wholenew areas of scientific discovery.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos904359]It was a small glass globe with a tiny piece of solid material mounted on theend of a wire serving as a single-wire connection with the high-frequencycurrent source. The central “button” of material electrostatically propelled thesurrounding gas molecules toward the glass globe. They then were repelled backtoward the button, striking it and heating it to incandescence as the processoccurred millions of times each second.Depending on the strength of the source, extremely high temperatures could beproduced that vaporized or melted most substances instantly. Tesla experimentedwith buttons composed of diamonds, rubies, and zirconia. He finally found thatcarborundum did not vaporize as rapidly as other hard materials or make depositsinside the globe— hence the name, carbon-button lamp.The heat energy of the incandescent button was transferred to the molecules ofthe slight amount of gas in the tube, causing them to become a source of lighttwenty times brighter for the amount of energy consumed than Edison’sincandescent lamp.With hundreds of thousands of volts of high-frequency currents surging throughhis body, he held in his hand this magnificent creation, a working model of theincandescent sun. With it he demonstrated what he believed to be cosmic rays.The sun, he reasoned, is an incandescent body carrying a high electrical chargeand emitting showers of tiny particles, each of which is energized by its greatvelocity. But, not being enclosed in a glass, the sun permits its rays to strikeout into space.Tesla was convinced that all space was filled with these particles, constantlybombarding Earth or other matter, just as in his carbon-button lamp the hardestmaterial was shattered into atomic dust.One of the manifestations of such bombardment, he said, was the aurora borealis.Although no record exists of his methods, he announced that he had detected suchcosmic rays, measured their energy, and found them moving with a velocity ofhundreds of millions of volts.5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos904560]The more sober physicists and engineers in his audience, hearing such outrageousclaims, kept their counsel. But where was the evidence?Today it is known that thermonuclear reaction on the sun causes the radiation ofX rays, ultraviolet, visible, and infrared rays as well as radio waves and solarparticles at the rate of 64 million watts (or volt-amperes) per square meter ofthe sun’s surface.Cosmic rays, according to modern knowledge, come in many shapes and forms andare the result of the formation and decay of particles as well as thehigh-energy collision of particles. They come not only from the sun but from thestars and novae or exploding stars.Solar electrons and protons reaching the vicinity of the Earth and trapped byEarth’s magnetic field form the Van Allen radiation belts. Solar radiation,visible and invisible, determines the surface temperatures of the planets.Auroral displays are caused by solar-emitted particles that collide with theatoms in our upper atmosphere.Five years after Tesla’s lecture Henri Becquerel, the French physicist, was todiscover the mysterious rays emitted by uranium. Marie and Pierre Curieconfirmed his work with their study of radium, whose uranium atoms wereexploding spontaneously. Tesla had believed, wrongly, that cosmic rays were thesimple cause of the radioactivity of radium, thorium, and uranium. But he wasentirely correct in predicting that bombardment with “cosmic rays,” i.e.,high-energy subatomic particles, could make other substances radioactive, as wasfinally demonstrated by Irene Curie and her husband Frédéric Joliot in 1934.Although the scientific world of Tesla’s time did not accept his theory ofcosmic rays, two scientists who later achieved fame in this field wouldacknowledge a debt to his inspiration. Thirty years were to pass before Dr.Robert A. Millikan rediscovered cosmic rays. He believed them to be, like light,vibratory—that is, that they were photons rather than charged particles. Thisled to one of the scientific dog fights of the 1940s between Nobel laureateMillikan and Nobel laureate Arthur H. Compton, who believed—and indeed wasadjudged to have proved—that cosmic rays consisted of high-velocity particles ofmatter, just as Tesla had described them.Both Millikan and Compton expressed their debt to the intuitiveness of theirVictorian predecessor. But science was to march on inexorably, proving cosmicrays more varied and complex than any of them had guessed.The strange little carbon-button lamp with which Tesla dazzled his audience atColumbia College on May 20, 1891, also embodied the concept of the pointelectron microscope. It produced electrified particles shooting out in straightlines from a tiny active spot on the button, kept at high potential. On thespherical surface of the globe these particles reproduced in phosphorescentimages the pattern of the microscopically tiny area from which they wereissuing.6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos904731]The only limit to the degree of magnification that could be obtained was thesize of the glass sphere. The greater the radius, the greater the magnification.Since electrons are smaller than light waves, objects too tiny to be seen bylight waves may nevertheless be enlarged by the patterns produced by emittedelectrons.Vladimir R. Zworykin is credited with having developed the electron microscopein 1939. Yet Tesla’s description of the effect achieved with his carbon-buttonlamp when he used extremely high vacuum stands with hardly a change in wordingfor a description of the million-magnification point electron microscope.7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos904877]Another effect produced by the carbon-button lamp derived from the phenomenon ofresonance. In describing the principle of resonance, Tesla often used analogiesof a wine glass and a swing. A wine glass that is broken by a violin’s note isshattered because the vibrations of the air that are produced by the violinhappen to be of the same frequency as the vibrations of the glass.A person in a swing may weigh two hundred pounds and a weak boy pushing it mayweigh but fifty and may push but a pound. Yet if he times his pushes to coincidewith the turn of the swing from him, and keeps adding a pound each time, he willeventually have to stop to avoid hurling the occupant of the swing out intospace.“The principle cannot fail,” Tesla would say. “It is necessary only to keepadding a little force at the right time.”And that is why Tesla’s carbon-button lamp may be described as an ancestor ofthe atom-smasher. Using the hard carborundum button in a nearly air-exhaustedglobe, connecting it to a source of high, rapidly alternating current, he causedthe remaining molecules of air to become charged, thus to be repelled atincreasingly high velocities from the button to the glass globe, and thence backto the button, shattering the carbon beads in the button into atomic dust whichjoined the oscillating air molecules to cause even further disintegration.“If the frequency could be brought high enough,” he said, “the loss due to theimperfect elasticity of the glass would be entirely negligible….”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos905171]In 1939 Ernest Orlando Lawrence of the University of California, Berkeley, wonthe Nobel Prize for his invention of the cyclotron. According to one account:“In 1929, Ernest Orlando Lawrence… read a paper by a German physicist who hadmanaged, by giving two electrostatic impulses instead of one, to impart tocharged potassium atoms in a vacuum tube twice the energy they would normallyget from a given voltage. Lawrence wondered: if the impulse could be doubled,could it not be tripled or multiplied any number of times? The problem was togive the particles a series of impulses a little stronger each time, until, likea child being pushed on a swing, the momentum was greatly increased.”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos905329]He made a particle-pushing machine of glass and sealing wax. The disk-shapedvacuum chamber was only four inches wide. Inside were two electrodes, eachshaped like half a round cake box and called D plates. Outside the vacuumchamber was a powerful electromagnet. Electrified particles or protons werewhirled in a magnetic field in the circular chamber until they attained veryhigh speed and were then fired out of the chamber in a narrow stream ofhigh-speed atomic bullets. Lawrence’s first model was called a cyclotron becauseit whirled the protons in circles. Soon he built a larger one that fired protonsup to energies of 1.2 million electron volts.Whether Tesla was actually smashing the carbon’s atomic nucleus, as his firstbiographer thought, has little bearing on the revolutionary nature of hisachievement. The inventor himself described the molecules of the residual gas asviolently impinging on the carbon button and causing it to rise to anincandescent state, or a near-plastic phase of the solid.Lawrence may have had no knowledge of Tesla’s molecular-bombardment lamp.Undoubtedly, however, he did know of the attempts to build an atom-smasher thatwere made by Gregory Breit and his associates at the Carnegie Institution inWashington, D.C., in 1929, for this group used a 5-million-volt Tesla coil tosupply the necessary power. Without such apparatus, the machines necessary tocrack the atom could never have functioned.The descriptions of Tesla’s carbon-button or molecular-bombardment lamp are tobe found in the permanent records of five learned societies.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_054.html#filepos1163302]Unfortunately in the early 1890s no society was sufficiently learned to imaginea use for this technological ancestor of the Atomic Age.Frédéric and Irene Joliot-Curie, Henri Becquerel, Robert A. Millikan, Arthur H.Compton, and Lawrence all won Nobel prizes. Victor F. Hess won the Nobel in 1936for discovering cosmic radiation. Surely it would be an act of simple justicewere the scientific community at least to acknowledge Tesla’s pioneerdiscoveries in each of their fields.Although many—perhaps most—of his scientific contemporaries failed to understandhis lectures fully, Tesla fired the imaginations of a perceptive few. And likesome today who discover him for the first time, a kind of temporary madnessseized them. “Not only did he teach by accomplishment,” recalled Maj. Edwin H.Armstrong, who later won fame for his contributions to radio, “but he taught bythe inspiration of a marvelous imagination that refused to accept the permanenceof what appeared to others to be insuperable difficulties: an imagination thegoals of which, in a number of instances, are still in the realms ofspeculation.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos905539]The English scientist J. A. Fleming wrote Tesla: “I congratulate you mostheartily on your grand success…. After that no one can doubt your qualificationsas a magician of the first order. Say the Order of the Flaming Sword.”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos905784]To trace Tesla’s productivity in a sequential fashion in this period is almostimpossible. He seemed everywhere at once, working in a dozen fields thatoverlapped and were interrelated—but always with electricity, that mysterioussubstance, at the heart of his investigations. To him it was a fluid withtranscendental powers that condescended to obey certain physical laws, ratherthat a stream of discrete particles, or wave packets obeying certain particlelaws, as in modern theory.Nevertheless, in the next few years he was to disclose the whole direction ofmodern electronics, although the electron itself would not be discovered until1897 by the British physicist Joseph J. Thomson.Faraday had shown in 1831 that it was possible to convert mechanical energy intoelectric current. Then, in the year of Tesla’s birth, England’s Lord Kelvin hadmade a further discovery that would inspire the Serbo-American when he beganseeking a new source of high-frequency currents, higher than could bemechanically produced.It had been believed that when a condenser was discharged, the electricityflowed out of one plate into the other like water. Kelvin showed that theprocess was complex, that electricity rushed from one plate into the other andback again until all the stored energy was used up, surging at a tremendouslyhigh frequency of hundreds of millions of times a second.On the day in Budapest when the concept of the rotating magnetic field wasrevealed to Tesla, he had seen in a flash the universe composed of a symphony ofalternating currents with the harmonies played on a vast range of octaves. The60-cycles-per-second AC was but a single note in a lower octave. In one of thehigher octaves at a frequency of billions of cycles per second was visiblelight. To explore this whole range of electrical vibration between hislow-frequency alternating current and light waves, he sensed, would bring himcloser to an understanding of the cosmic symphony.The work of James Clerk Maxwell in 1873 had indicated the existence of a vastrange of electromagnetic vibrations above and below visible light—vibrations ofmuch shorter and much longer wavelengths. This theory had been tested by Prof.Heinrich Hertz of Germany who, in a search for waves longer than light or heat,first produced man-made electromagnetic radiation at Bonn in 1888. Hertz’sexperiments with the spark discharge of an induction coil had proved theexistence of a magnetic field when he sent a powerful electric charge across aspark gap, causing a smaller spark to jump across a second gap some distanceaway. At the same time in England, Sir Oliver Lodge was seeking to measure tinyelectrical waves in wire circuits.Hertz’s equipment had been feeble and the spark coil both impractical anddangerous. Tesla now came up with something both different and very muchsuperior: a series of high-frequency alternators producing frequencies up to33,000 cycles per second (33,000 Hz.).*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_055.html#filepos1163702] Thistype of machinery was in fact the forerunner of the great high-frequencyalternators developed by others for continuous-wave radio communication in thedistant future, but for the inventor’s immediate needs, the device was stillinadequate. He therefore went on to build what is known as the Tesla coil, anair-core transformer with primary and secondary coils tuned to resonate—astep-up transformer which converts relatively low-voltage high current tohigh-voltage low current at high frequencies.This device for producing high voltages, which is today used in one form oranother in every radio and television set, was in a very short time to becomepart of the research equipment of every university science laboratory. Itallowed the operator to convert the weak, highly damped oscillations of theoriginal Hertz circuit and to sustain currents of almost any magnitude. In thisresearch Tesla thus anticipated by several years the first experiments ofMarconi.The need for insulating this high-voltage equipment led to his immersing it inoil to exclude all air, a method that soon found valuable commercialapplication, since it became the universal way of insulating all high-tensionapparatus. To reduce resistance in his coils, Tesla used stranded conductorswith separately insulated strands. Since he seldom took time to patent hisresearch tools or methods, this too went into the common pool of knowledge. Itwas later commercialized by others, becoming known as “Litz wire,” a termderived from Litzendraht (“stranded wire”) cable.He then developed a new kind of reciprocating dynamo adapted to his specialneeds in high-frequency currents—an ingenious single-cylinder engine withoutvalves, that could be operated by compressed air or steam. The speed it attainedwas so remarkably constant that he proposed adapting it to his 60-cyclepolyphase system, using synchronous motors, properly geared down, as a means ofproviding the correct time wherever in the world alternating current wasavailable. This was the inspiration for the modern electric clock.12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos905972] Tesla,in his rush of discovery, took no time to patent a timekeeper either.And not least, from the dangerous experiments in which he learned to work withhundreds of thousands of volts of high-frequency electricity came anotherdiscovery of great importance to the world. In 1890 he announced the therapeuticdeep-heating value of high-frequency currents on the human body. The processbecame known as diathermy. From it would flow an enormous field of medicaltechnology, with many early imitators both in America and Europe.13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos906133]"},{"pageContent":"7. RADIO Long hours of mental exertion in his New York laboratory over many months causedTesla to experience a strange partial amnesia at the start of the 1890s.Immediately after finishing his consulting work for the Westing-housecorporation, he had become obsessed with what was first spoken of as thewireless telephone—or simply wireless—and later by its modern name, radio.After building the powerful coils in his laboratory, he had ascertained thatbroadcasting intelligence was simply one aspect of a vast global andinterplanetary potential. Radio posed a different set of problems fromtransmitting electricity without wires, yet he believed them close enough to betackled in a single stunning orchestration.“I had produced a striking phenomenon with my grounded transmitter,” he laterrecalled, “and was endeavoring to ascertain its true significance in relation tothe currents propagated through the earth. It seemed a hopeless undertaking, andfor more than a year I worked unremittingly but in vain. This profound study soentirely absorbed me that I became forgetful of everything else, even of myundermined health. At last, as I was on the point of breaking down, natureapplied the preservative, inducing lethal sleep.”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos906835]From having gone almost without rest for months, he said that he had then slept“as if drugged.” On regaining his senses, he was shocked to discover that hecould visualize no scenes from his past except those of earliest infancy.Having developed a marked indifference to medical doctors, he put his mind tothe problem of curing himself.Night after night he concentrated on the memories of early childhood, graduallybringing more and more of his life into focus. In this unfolding process theimage of his mother was always the principal figure. He began to feel aconsuming desire to go to her.“This feeling grew so strong,” he recalled, “that I resolved to drop all workand satisfy my longing. But I found it too hard to break away from thelaboratory and several months elapsed, during which I succeeded in reviving allthe impressions of my past life….”It was early spring of 1892. He had not yet accepted a flock of invitations tolecture in England and France and indeed was still in a state of emotionalconflict about doing so.Then, he recalls, a vision materialized “out of the mist of oblivion,” and hesaw himself at the Hotel de la Paix in Paris, just coming to from one of hispeculiar sleeping spells. In this “recollection,” he saw himself being handed adispatch bearing the sad news that his mother was dying.A curious fact about this period of partial amnesia, Tesla later wrote, was thathe was alive to everything touching on his research, which went forward apace.“I could recall the smallest details and the least significant observations inmy experiments, and even recite pages of texts and complex mathematicalformulae.”It appears there had been reason for his concerns about his mother’s health:letters had been arriving from the family home at Gospic indicating that herhealth was indeed failing. He had also been receiving from all parts of theworld invitations, honors, “and other flattering inducements” to visit andlecture. At last he accepted those from London and Paris, planning thereafter togo directly home.His lecture to the Institution of Electrical Engineers in London was hailed as amajor scientific event, and when it was over, the British did not want to lethim go.“Sir James Dewar insisted on my appearing before the Royal Society,” herecalled. “I was a man of firm resolve but succumbed easily to the forcefularguments of the great Scotchman. He pushed me into a chair and poured out halfa glass of wonderful brown fluid which sparkled in all sorts of iridescentcolors and tasted like nectar.”To his surprise Dewar said, “Now you are sitting in Faraday’s chair and you areenjoying whiskey he used to drink.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos906996] Onbeing assured that no one else in the world more deserved these honors, he waswon over. The French could wait one more day.His lecture before the Royal Society of Great Britain, attended by the elite ofthe scientific world, brought yet more accolades for the young inventor. LordRayleigh, the distinguished physicist who was then chairman of the RoyalSociety, urged the inventor, because of his great talent for mining fundamentaldiscoveries, to consider revising his modus operandi.He recommended that Tesla in the future specialize in some single area ofresearch. This was a highly novel idea for a scientist who demanded all theanswers at once.Sir William Crookes, whose work Tesla greatly admired, sent a letter to hishotel after the lecture, describing how he had been inspired to subject his ownbody to strange electrical effects.“My dear Tesla,” he wrote. “You are a true prophet. I have finished my new coil,and it does not do so well as the little one you made for me. I fear it is toolarge…. The phosphorescence through my body when I hold one terminal isdecidedly inferior to that given with the little one….”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos907131]The observant Crookes had noted the inventor’s exhaustion and went on to warnhim that he appeared to be on the verge of a physical and nervous breakdown. “Ihope you will get away to the mountains of your native land as soon as you can,”he wrote. “You are suffering from overwork, and if you do not take care ofyourself, you will break down. Don’t answer this letter or see anyone but takethe first train.”Sir William was right; but his advice was just then impossible for Tesla toaccept.The inventor hurried to Paris where he lectured on “Experiments with AlternatingCurrents of High Potential and High Frequency” and again demonstrated hissensitive electronic tubes. This time his audiences were the SociétéInternationale des Electriciens and the Société Française de Physique.That same month of February 1892, Sir William Crookes affirmed Tesla’sintuition. He published a prediction that electromagnetic waves in space couldbe used for wireless.No sooner had Tesla finished his last lecture than, pleading exhaustion, he fledto his room at the Hotel de la Paix. It seemed almost an anticlimax when amessenger handed him a telegram saying that his mother was dying.Rushing to the station, he squeezed aboard a train just leaving for Croatia.Later transferring to a carriage, he reached home in time to spend a few hourswith his mother. Then, near collapse, he was taken to a building close to hishome to rest.“As I lay helpless there,” he wrote in his autobiographical memoir, “I thoughtthat if my mother died while I was away from her bedside she would surely giveme a sign…. I [had been] in London in company with my late friend, Sir WilliamCrookes, when spiritualism was discussed, and I was under the full sway of thesethoughts…. I reflected that the conditions for a look into the beyond were mostfavorable, for my mother was a woman of genius and particularly excelling in thepowers of intuition.”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos907345]During that entire night his mind was strained with expectancy, but nothinghappened until early in the morning. In a light dream or “swoon,” he says, hesaw “a cloud carrying angelic figures of marvelous beauty, one of whom gazedupon me lovingly and gradually assumed the features of my mother. The appearanceslowly floated across the room and vanished, and I was awakened by anindescribably sweet song of many voices. In that instant a certitude, which nowords can express, came upon me that my mother had just died. And that wastrue….”It was important to him later to account for the external causes of theseapparently trancendental impressions, since he still held to his thesis thathuman beings were mere “meat machines.” The following “explanation” appears inhis memoir:“When I recovered I sought for a long time the external cause of this strangemanifestation and, to my great relief, I succeeded after many months offruitless effort. I had seen the painting of a celebrated artist, representingallegorically one of the seasons in the form of a cloud with a group of angelswhich seemed to actually float in the air, and this had struck me forcefully. Itwas exactly the same that appeared in my dream, with the exception of mymother’s likeness. The music came from the choir in the church nearby at theearly mass of Easter morning, explaining everything satisfactorily in conformitywith scientific facts.“This occurred long ago, and I have never had the faintest reason since tochange my views on psychical and spiritual phenomena, for which there isabsolutely no foundation. The belief in these is the natural outgrowth ofintellectual development. Religious dogmas are no longer accepted in theirorthodox meaning, but every individual clings to faith in a supreme power ofsome kind. We all must have an ideal to govern our conduct and insurecontentment, but it is immaterial whether it be one of creed, art, science oranything else, so long as it fulfills the function of a dematerializing force.It is essential to the peaceful existence of humanity as a whole that one commonconception should prevail.“While I have failed to obtain any evidence in support of the contentions ofpsychologists and spiritualists, I have proved to my complete satisfaction theautomatism of life, not only through continuous observations of individualactions, but even more conclusively through certain generalizations.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos907506]He said that whenever friends or relatives of his had been hurt by others in aparticular way, he himself felt what he could only characterize as a “cosmic”pain. This resulted from the fact that human bodies are of similar constructionand exposed to the same external influences, which results in likeness ofresponse. “A very sensitive and observant being, with his highly developedmechanism all intact, and acting with precision in obedience to the changingconditions of the environment,” he wrote, “is endowed with a transcendingmechanical sense, enabling him to evade perils too subtle to be directlyperceived. When he comes in contact with others whose controlling organs areradically faulty, that sense asserts itself and he feels the ‘cosmic’ pain….”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos907641]It is obvious from the inventor’s writings that he himself was never completelysatisfied with his theories on this subject.This was not to be the only instance of precognition and extrasensory perceptionin Tesla’s life. But he always tried to explain them away mechanistically,tracing intuition to external events. Thus when his sister Angelina fell fatallyill, he sent a telegram from New York saying, “I had a vision that Angelina wasarising and disappearing. I sensed all is not well.” Tesla’s nephew, SavaKosanović would later recall how the inventor told him of such premonitions butdiscounted them. He was a sensitive receiver, he said, registering anydisturbance—but there was no mystery to it.“He declared,” said Kosanović, “that each man is like an automaton which reactsto external impressions.” But what the external impressions were that gave himactual precognition, as hereafter described, he never discussed.He told Kosanović of an incident that occurred in Manhattan in the 1890s afterhe had given a big party. Some of the guests were preparing to take a train forPhiladelphia. Tesla, seized with “a powerful urge,” was impelled to detain them,causing them to miss the train. It crashed. Many passengers were injured.7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos907776]He associated a personal anomaly with the anxious rush to his mother’s deathbed.A patch of white hair developed on the right side of his head, which wasotherwise jet black and thick. After a few months, however, it returned to itsnatural state.Following his mother’s death he was ill for a number of weeks. When finally ableto get about, he visited relatives in Belgrade, where he received the welcomedue a world-famous native son, and then went on to Zagreb and Budapest.As a child Tesla had been fascinated by the relationship between lightning andrain. On this trip, while roaming in his native mountains, he had an experiencethat profoundly affected him as a scientist.“I sought shelter from an approaching storm,” he later recalled. “The sky becameoverhung with dark clouds but somehow the rain was delayed until, all of asudden, there was a lightning flash and a few moments after, a deluge. Thisobservation set me thinking. It was manifest that the two phenomena were closelyrelated, as cause and effect, and a little reflection led me to the conclusionthat the electrical energy enclosed in the precipitation of the water wasinconsiderable, the function of lightning being much like that of a sensitivetrigger.“Here was a stupendous possibility of achievement. If we could produce electricstorms of the required ability, this whole planet and the conditions ofexistence on it could be transformed. The sun raises the water of the oceans andwinds drive it to distant regions where it remains in a state of the mostdelicate balance. If it were in our power to upset it when and wherever desired,this mighty life-sustaining medium could be at will controlled. We couldirrigate arid deserts, create lakes and rivers and provide motive power inunlimited amounts.”Controlling lightning, he concluded, would be the most convenient way ofharnessing the power of the sun.“The consummation depended on our ability to develop electric forces of an orderof those in nature,” he decided. “It seemed a hopeless undertaking, but I madeup my mind to try. [I]mmediately upon my return to the United States, in thesummer of 1892, work was begun which was to me all the more attractive, becausea means of the same kind was necessary for the successful transmission of energywithout wires.”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos907937]On August 31, 1892, The Electrical Engineer reported the return to New York ofMr. Nikola Tesla, the distinguished electrician, on the steamship AugustaVictoria from Hamburg. After commenting on the death of Tesla’s mother and hissubsequent illness, the journal added: “His magnificent reception at the handsof European electricians has become, like his investigations and researches,part of electrical history; and the honors conferred on him were such as to makeAmericans very proud of one who has chosen this country as a home.”He moved scientific history forward again in the spring of 1893 when, addressingthe Franklin Institute in Philadelphia and the National Electric LightAssociation at St. Louis, he described in detail the principles of radiobroadcasting.At St. Louis he made the first public demonstration ever of radio communication,although Marconi is generally credited with having achieved this feat in 1895.Tesla’s twenty-eight-year-old assistant at the St. Louis lecture was H. P.Broughton, whose son, William G. Broughton, is licensee of the SchenectadyMuseum memorial amateur radio station W21R. At the station’s dedication speechin 1976 William Broughton touched upon highlights of Tesla’s historicdemonstration at St. Louis—after a week’s preparation—as personally told to himby his father.“Eighty-three years ago, in St. Louis, the National Electric Light Associationsponsored a public lecture on high-voltage high-frequency phenomena,” said theyounger Broughton. “On the auditorium stage a demonstration was set up by usingtwo groups of equipment.“In the transmitter group on one side of the stage was a 5-kva high-voltagepole-type oil-filled distribution transformer connected to a condenser bank ofLeyden jars, a spark gap, a coil, and a wire running up to the ceiling.“In the receiver group at the other side of the stage was an identical wirehanging from the ceiling, a duplicate condenser bank of Leyden jars and coil—butinstead of the spark gap, there was a Geissler tube that would light up like amodern fluorescent lamp bulb when voltage was applied. There were nointerconnecting wires between transmitter and receiver.“The transformer in the transmitter group,” Broughton continued, “was energizedfrom a special electric power line through an exposed two-blade knife switch.When this switch was closed, the transformer grunted and groaned, the Leydenjars showed corona sizzling around their foil edges, the spark gap crackled witha noisy spark discharge, and an invisible electromagnetic field radiated energyinto space from the transmitter antenna wire.“Simultaneously, in the receiver group, the Geissler tube lighted up fromradio-frequency excitation picked up by the receiver antenna wire.“Thus wireless was born. A wireless message had been transmitted by the5-kilowatt spark transmitter, and instantly received by the Geissler-tubereceiver thirty feet away….“The world-famous genius who invented, conducted, and explained this lecturedemonstration,” he concluded, “was Nikola Tesla.”Although the St. Louis demonstration was no “message sent ’round the world” asTesla would doubtless of course have preferred it to be, he had neverthelessdemonstrated all the fundamental principles of modern radio: 1. an antenna oraerial wire; 2. a ground connection; 3. an aerial-ground circuit containinginductance and capacity; 4. adjustable inductance and capacity (for tuning); 5.sending and receiving sets tuned to resonance with each other; and 6. electronictube detectors.9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos908098]In his earliest transmissions he used vibrating contacts to make continuouswaves in a receiving system audible. A few years later the crystal detector wasintroduced to receive the signals of spark-gap transmitters. This became theaccepted practice of commercial radio until the invention by Maj. Edwin H.Armstrong of the regenerative or feedback circuit, which brought radio into theera of amplified sound. Later, Armstrong introduced the superheterodynebeat-note circuit, which underlies all modern radio and radar reception.Armstrong, a graduate student of Prof. Michael Pupin’s at Columbia University,had been inspired by Tesla’s lectures. Later, however, perhaps influenced byPupin, he would champion Marconi in the prolonged and bitter war between thelatter and Tesla over radio patents.The scientist who, next to Tesla, most deserved credit for pioneering radio wasSir Oliver Lodge, for in 1894 he demonstrated the possibility of transmittingtelegraph signals wirelessly by Hertzian waves a distance of 150 yards.Two years later young Marchese Guglielmo Marconi arrived in London with awireless set identical to Lodge’s. Naturally he aroused little comment among theleading contenders in the race. He did, however, have a ground connection andantenna or aerial wire with which he had made crude experiments in Bologna. Asit happened, this equipment was exactly what Tesla had described in his widelypublished lectures of 1893, which had been translated into many languages.10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos908720] Later,as we shall see, Marconi was to deny that he had ever read of Tesla’s system,and the U.S. Patent Examiner was to brand his denial patently absurd.Significantly, until the early 1960s only eleven patent cases would reach theUnited States Supreme Court and of those few, two involved Tesla patents. Thefundamental nature of his work was characteristic. The high court heard casesinvolving his polyphase alternating-current patents and his radio patents, andboth actions were decided in his favor. Ironically, neither of these was broughtby the inventor himself.January sleet scraped at the windows of Tesla’s laboratory. Kolman Czito, hisassistant, shivered as he helped to adjust a machine, but the inventor workedaway in total concentration. For all that Tesla was aware of the temperature, itmight as well have been blossom time.The telephone rang, and he sighed as he went to answer it. The operator wasputting through a long-distance call from Pittsburgh.George Westinghouse’s voice boomed across the miles, almost stuttering in hisexcitement. His firm had gotten the contract for installing all the power andlighting equipment for the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893, otherwise known as theColumbian Exposition—the first electrical fair in history. It would use Tesla’salternating-current system, his maligned and ridiculed AC, all the way.This was good news and bad: good because it offered a great international eventas a showcase; bad because it meant leaving work that meant more to him thananything else in life. His radio research was now at its most exciting, criticalpoint.The industrialist’s words were tumbling over each other. It was going to be thegrandest spectacle of modern times, he said; a chance not only to show what ACcould do but to exhibit all the new electrical products being invented. Whowould not give an arm and a leg for such an opportunity?General Electric would be showing Edison’s inventions. Everybody who was anybodyin international science would be there. The architecture was to be magnificent.“When does the Fair open?” Tesla asked, fearing the worst.“May first. Hardly time for everything we must do.”“All right, Mr. Westinghouse,” said the inventor.Turning away from his beloved coils, he went to work on the big show. Ideas werealready racing through his mind for ways to amaze the scientific community andbewitch the public. He could not possibly have said no.The United States both wanted and needed a spectacle. Shortly after PresidentGrover Cleveland was elected to a second term of office, the nation was engulfedby bank failures, joblessness, and bankruptcies. The Panic of 1893 haunted thehumble and the mighty alike. Something to take people’s minds off the imminentprospect of standing in breadlines seemed politically desirable.The Columbian Exposition was devised as a celebration (one year late) of thefour hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America. President Clevelandinvited the royalty of Spain and Portugal and other foreign dignitaries. He evenagreed to turn the gold master key that would release the electricity and floodthe City of Tomorrow with light, starting up fountains and machinery, raisingflags and banners, and signaling the grand opening of the extravaganza. To agreeto turn the master key took courage. Electricity had been installed in the WhiteHouse in 1891, but thus far no president had ever been allowed to touch theswitches. The task had been prudently left to hirelings, for, after all, thepublic had been warned by no less an authority than Edison of the dangersinvolved.Chicago was a gray city when the great day finally came, the bread-lines nowbeing actual and long. But the site of the Fair was breathtaking to themultitude that arrived, and reporters began to write of it as the White City.The New York Times (May 1, 1893) reported, “Grover Cleveland, calm anddignified, in a few eloquent words delivered in a clear, ringing voice, whichwas heard by the great multitude gathered before him, declared the World’sColumbian Exposition open …. and touched the ivory-and-gold key….”A Tower of Light flared into brilliance with a thousand electric bulbs radiatingthe promise of a brighter future. Venetian canals had been built to mirror themodern illumination of “Old World” architecture. Everywhere the pulse of thefuture throbbed: alternating current.As the lights went on, the massed human beings below uttered a great sigh. Then,in the seats reserved for them, the Cabinet officers, the Duke and Duchess ofVeragua, and other foreign dignitaries began to cheer. The crowd lustily joinedin while tightly corseted women fainted and fell like soldiers in battle.Westinghouse, who had underbid General Electric on the illumination contract,had enjoyed a decisive triumph. In the Electricity Building could be seen allthe latest products and inventions of American ingenuity. At night especiallythe Fair seemed an enchanted place. Colored searchlights played on thefountains, making them so beautiful that people actually wept tears of joy.Adventurous citizens careered around the fairgrounds on an elevated train drivenby electricity. The foolhardy crowded to get seats on Mr. G. W. Ferris’senormous wheel, which was 250 feet in diameter and like nothing ever seenbefore. They packed in sixty to a car to soar out precariously above both theWhite City and the gray city that lay beyond.Between May and October, 25 million Americans visited Chicago to see the latestwonders of science, industry, art, and architecture. This was then a third ofthe total population.Visitors crowded into the display rooms presided over by the famous NikolaTesla. Clad in white tie and tails, he stood among a magician’s feast ofhigh-frequency equipment, demonstrating one electrical miracle after another. Adarkened alcove held tables that glowed with his phosphorescent tubes and lamps.One length of tubing radiated the words “Welcome, Electricians,” which Tesla hadhad laboriously blown letter by letter from the molten glass. His other lightshonored such great scientists as Helmholtz, Faraday, Maxwell, Henry, andFranklin. And he had not forgotten—right up there with the famous scientists—thename of the most eminent living poet of Yugoslavia: Zmaj Jovan, whose pseudonymwas ZMAJ.Day after day he captivated the curious with demonstrations illustrating howalternating current worked.11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos908957] On avelvet-covered table small metallic objects—copper balls, metal eggs—were madeto spin at great speeds, reversing themselves smoothly at fixed intervals.He demonstrated the first synchronized electric clock attached to an oscillatorand showed his first disruptive discharge coil. The audiences understood littleof the science involved, yet were enthralled. And when he seemed to turn himselfinto a human firestorm by using the apparatus with which he had so oftenthrilled his laboratory visitors, they cried out in fear and wonder.A bevy of Tesla’s young women friends arrived under firm escort from New YorkCity. They flirted with him, rode on the Ferris wheel, and visited the Woman’sBuilding to hear Mrs. Potter Palmer (Chicago’s retort to Mrs. Astor) declarethat the model kitchen, which boasted an electric stove, electric fans, and evenan automatic dishwasher, heralded the liberation of the female.It is possible, however, that they felt more liberated by the sight of PrincessEulalia who, representing her nephew King Alfonso of Spain, brazenly smokedcigarettes in public.They saw the first zipper and Edison’s Kinetoscope (early motion-picturephotography) which brought “scenes to the eyes as well as sounds to the ear”;and they listened to thin bursts of music piped by telephone from a concert inManhattan. They stood with crowds ogling the bellydancing of an energetic youngwoman billed as Little Egypt and—because the Fair offered something for everytaste—admired a plump Venus de Milo molded in chocolate.A journalist, one of a throng who visited the Tesla exhibition, sent this reportto his newspaper:“Mr. Tesla has been seen receiving through his hands currents at a potential ofmore than 200,000 volts, vibrating a million times per second, and manifestingthemselves in dazzling streams of light…. After such a striking test, which, bythe way, no one has displayed a hurried inclination to repeat, Mr. Tesla’s bodyand clothing have continued for some time to emit fine glimmers or halos ofsplintered light. In fact, an actual flame is produced by the agitation ofelectrostatically charged molecules, and the curious spectacle can be seen ofpuissant, white, ethereal flames, that do not consume anything, bursting fromthe ends of an induction coil as though it were the bush on holy ground.”The inventor, it was reported, expected one day to envelop himself in a completesheet of lambent fire that would leave him quite uninjured. Such currents, heclaimed, would keep a naked man warm at the North Pole, and their use intherapeutics was but one of their practical possibilities.“My first announcement [of medical diathermy] spread like fire and experimentswere undertaken by a host of experts here and in other countries,” he laterwrote. “When a famous French physician, Dr. d’Arsonval, declared that he hadmade the same discovery, a heated controversy relative to priority was started.The French, eager to honor their countryman, made him a member of the Academy,ignoring entirely my earlier publication. Resolved to take steps for vindicatingmy claim, I went to Paris, when I met Dr. d’Arsonval. His personal charmdisarmed me completely and I abandoned my intention, content to rest on therecord. It shows that my disclosure antedated his and also that he used myapparatus in his demonstrations….”12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos909126]Although Tesla is credited with having first recorded the fact (in 1891) thatheat production resulting from the bombardment of tissue with high-frequencyalternating currents could have medical uses for the treatment of arthritis andmany other afflictions, the name “D’Arsonval current” persisted in medicalterminology. In any event, the use of radiation spread rapidly, and a field ofmedical technology—at first called diathermy and now calledhyperthermia—developed that today includes the application of X rays,microwaves, and radio waves to destroy cancer cells. They are also used forhealing bones and tissue.Throughout his life Tesla was also a firm believer in the therapeutic value ofwhat he called “cold fire,” both for refreshing the mind and cleansing the skin.In fact, the brush discharge or corona from a low-power therapeutic device doesseem to enhance muscular action, may improve circulation, and also generatesozone, which can be mildly stimulating when breathed in low concentration.Physicist Maurice Stahl said, “There is also a psychosomatic effect. I wouldconsider the overall effect more than mechanical.”The inventor also had hopes that electrical anaesthesia might become possible.And he proposed burying high-voltage wires in classrooms to stimulate dullstudents. To key up actors before they went on stage, he arranged to install ahigh-tension dressing room in a New York theater.At the Columbian Exposition Tesla also described heating bars of iron andmelting lead and tin in the electromagnetic field of specially designedhigh-frequency coils. This was to have important commercial consequences manyyears later.Although he had left his laboratory for Chicago reluctantly, the Fair proved anexhilarating experience for him. It was equally so for George Westinghouse. Thelatter displayed in the Machinery Hall various commercial motors of the ACsystem and twelve generators of the two-phase type that had been builtespecially for distributing light and power. To show the complete adaptabilityof his system, Westinghouse demonstrated how a rotary converter could changepolyphase AC into DC to run a railway motor.Perhaps Tesla’s biggest day came on August 25 when he delivered a lecture to theElectrical Congress and demonstrated his mechanical and electrical oscillators.Thomas Commerford Martin, the well-known editor and electrical engineer, wrotethat scientists would now be able to carry on investigations in alternatingcurrent with great precision. But also, he added, one of the uses of suchequipment would be in the field of “harmonic and synchronous telegraphy” andthat “vast possibilities are again opened up.”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos909407]Hermann Helmholtz, the celebrated German physicist, attended the ElectricalCongress as an official delegate of the German Empire and was elected itspresident. Tesla’s fellow countryman Michael Pupin, too, was a participant. “Thesubjects discussed at that congress,” Pupin later wrote, “and the men whodiscussed them, showed that the electrical science was not in its infancy, andthat electrical things were not done by the rule of thumb.” Thus he toorepudiated Edison’s contention that alternating current was too littleunderstood for safe use.Tesla returned to New York elated by his triumphs. In the flush of fame he wasmore determined than ever to avoid the many public claims on his time. He wouldhave preferred to avoid all commercial claims as well, but the need to financeradio and other research soon made this impossible."},{"pageContent":"8. HIGH SOCIETY Wall Street was dominated by personal adventures, including such legendaryfigures as Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, the Vanderbilts, Edward H. Harriman, JayGould, Thomas Fortune Ryan, and other more ephemeral but equally colorfulspecimens. Some might bloom for a day, only to be trampled and forgotten. Mostthrived on trading of such dubious legality that anyone who tried to emulatethem today would probably be obliged to live in a foreign capital beyond threatof extradition. Dealing in coal, railroads, steel, tobacco, and the new field ofelectrical utilities, they plunged, cornered, and sold short.According to the irreverent Twain, the gospel as preached by the robber baronsduring this galloping phase of the industrial revolution was, “Get money. Get itquickly. Get it in abundance. Get it dishonestly, if you can, honestly, if youmust.”Each day when the closing gong sounded at the Stock Exchange on Wall Street,many members moved on to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which was then located wherethe Empire State Building now stands. For a broker to be admitted as a member ofthe “Waldorf Crowd” was a patent of success. The splendid lounges and diningrooms served as showcases in which to observe the preenings of the winners aswell as the dismay of the losers. Fear was often a palpable presence.Tesla instinctively gravitated to the glass-enclosed Palm Room to see and beseen by the money men so important to his career. He had begun dining thereregularly some years before he was able to take up residence at the fashionablehotel. Compared to the enormous wealth amassed by the plungers and builders ofthe period, he was not affluent, but he was handsome, polished, charming, andlived as if his prospects for wealth were excellent, as indeed they were. Andafter all, as Ward McAllister observed of the Gilded Age, “A man with a milliondollars can be as happy nowadays as though he were rich.”Tesla himself was now a member of McAllister’s exclusive roster of wealth andsocial position, the New York “400.” He was meeting those fabled “great silentmen with cold eyes and hard smiles” on their own playing field. His knowledgewas being courted, and he enjoyed the game. Should he allow himself to become,like Edison, “Morganized”? Should he be “Astored,” “Insulled,” “Melloned,”“Ryaned,” or “Fricked”? He had no illusions as to the risk involved. No matterwho capitalized his inventions, there would certainly be meddling interferenceand probably ultimate control. That was how the system worked, and it was theprice an inventor must pay.A few knowledgeable men had already begun to call him the greatest inventor inhistory, greater even than Edison. If further proof of his success in the NewWorld were needed, a backlash was developing against him—not just in the Edisoncamp but, more quietly, among other scientists who received less attention fromthe press and who were never invited to the exciting celebrity affairs in hislaboratory.All his life Tesla was to cultivate an adoring host of journalists, editors,publishers, and literati. Although his lectures made him world-famous and werepreserved in the records of learned societies, he never once submitted anarticle to an academic journal. Indeed, when he first arrived in America therewas none; institutional ties with the big three of industry, government, anduniversities had not yet become the accepted avenue to recognition for ascientist. But now that was changing.He was a loner by preference when the time for lone operators was swiftlypassing. Edison himself, as one of the last of the “independents,” was atransitional figure who built the first of the large industrial researchlaboratories, setting the style for modern science.Tesla’s lifelong distaste for corporate involvement was twofold: most otherengineers drove him mad with impatience, and he resented any form of control. Ifhe had to deal with a corporate person, he preferred it to be the president orchairman of the board.The movers and shakers he observed at the Waldorf after the Stock Exchange hadclosed for the day were limited conversationalists. Their interests were largelyin rates and tariffs, their fears riveted on financial panics and labor riots.Partisan politics scarcely interested them, only the buying of blocs of votes asnecessary to protect the rates and tariffs. Bernard Baruch once told of a crudeGerman trader named Jacob Field, known as Jake, who was being wined and dined bysome grateful friends. When two lovely women on either side of him were stumpedto know what to talk to him about, one of them finally asked whether he likedBalzac. Jake tugged on his mustaches. “I never deal in dem outside stocks,” hesaid.1 [../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos909727]Journalists and bluestockings were much more to Tesla’s natural taste. As forthe gentlemen of the press, they were so enthralled by his charismatic presencethat they could scarcely remember after meeting him whether he had bushy blackhair or wavy brown, or what was the color of his eyes or the length of histhumbs—the latter being, curiously, a matter of intense interest.Male writers of the period often affected a florid prose style of which JulianHawthorne, the novelist and only son of Nathaniel Hawthorne, was a leadingexponent. Smitten by his first meeting with Tesla, he described something like avision seen in an opium den:“I saw a tall, slender young man with long arms and fingers, whose ratherlanguid movements veiled extraordinary muscular power. His face was oval, broadat the temples, and strong at the lips and chin; with long eyes whose lids wereseldom fully lifted, as if he were in a waking dream, seeing visions which werenot revealed to the generality. He had a slow smile, as if awakening toactualities, and finding a humorous quality in them. Withal he manifested acourtesy and amiability which were almost feminine, and beneath all were thesimplicity and integrity of a child. . . . He has abundant wavy brown hair, blueeyes and a fair skin. . . . To be with Tesla is to enter a domain of freedomeven freer than solitude, because the horizon enlarges so….”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos909926]On the other hand, one of the inventor’s secretaries, as if reciting “PeterPiper,” wrote that he had bushy black hair brushed back briskly.Yet everyone seemed agreed as to the power of Tesla’s personality. FranklinChester in the Citizen (August 22, 1897) wrote that no one could look upon himwithout feeling his force. Chester described him as well over six feet tall(actually he was a towering six feet six inches), with large hands andabnormally long thumbs, “a sign of great intelligence.” As to the inventor’scontroversial hair, Chester said it was straight, a deep and shining black,brushed sharply from over his ears to make a ridge with serrated edges. Hischeekbones were high and Slavic, his eyes blue and deeply set, burning likeballs of fire.“Those weird flashes of light he makes with his instruments,” Chester continued,“seemed almost to shoot from them. His head is wedge shaped. His chin is almosta point. . . . When he talks you listen. You do not know what he is saying, butit enthralls you. . . . He speaks the perfect English of a highly educatedforeigner, without accent and with precision…. He speaks eight languages equallywell….”Hearst’s flamboyant editor Arthur Brisbane found the inventor’s eyes “ratherlight,” as a result of straining his mind so much. (Tesla claimed this wastrue.) Brisbane shared the prevailing view that long thumbs meant a powerfulintellect, referring his readers to the very small thumbs of apes. Tesla’smouth, however, he thought too small and his chin, although not weak, not strongenough. He guessed his height at more than six feet and his weight at less than140 pounds, and reported that he tended to stoop. Tesla’s voice he described asbeing somewhat shrill, probably from psychic tension.“He has that supply of self-love and self-confidence that usually goes withsuccess.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos910126]John J. O’Neill, the Pulitzer Prize–winning science editor of the New YorkHerald Tribune, who was to become Tesla’s first biographer and devoted friend ofmany years, described his eyes as gray-blue, which he felt to be a matter ofgenetic inheritance rather than mental strain. To him Tesla was a god whoseethereal brilliance “created the modern era.”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos910406]From the romantic point of view, O’Neill noted, he was too tall and slender topose as the physical Adonis, but his other qualifications more than compensated.“He was handsome of face, had a magnetic personality, but was quiet, almost shy;he was soft spoken, well educated and wore clothes well.”As to Tesla’s own view of such matters, he fancied himself as being the verybest-dressed man on Fifth Avenue. Moreover, as he once told his secretary, heintended to remain so. His usual streetwear included a black Prince Albert coatand a derby hat, and these he wore in the laboratory too unless some importantexperiment demanded formal evening wear. His handkerchiefs were of white silkrather than linen, his neckties sober, and his collars stiff. He threw out allaccessories, including gloves, after a very few wearings. Jewelry he never woreand felt strongly about as the result of his phobias.Robert Underwood Johnson, shortly after meeting Tesla, arranged that he be givenan honorary degree from his own alma mater, Yale University. And later whenColumbia also conferred an honorary degree upon him, Johnson was called upon todescribe the special virtues of the inventor’s character. Tesla, he said, had apersonality of “distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement,generosity, and force….”Women were smitten as often as his male admirers.Miss Dorothy F. Skerritt, his secretary of many years, attested that even in oldage his presence and manner were impressive. “From under protruding eyebrows,”she wrote, “his deep-set, steel gray, soft, yet piercing eyes, seemed to readyour innermost thoughts . . . his face glowed with almost ethereal radiance….His genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanlycharacteristics that were so ingrained in his soul.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos910559]His friend Hawthorne was struck not only by Tesla’s physical attractiveness butby his richness of culture. Seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer, henoted, who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, alinguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink. “[W]hen it was question of thevintage of a wine, or the condition and cooking of an ortolan, he knew that,too.” And when he spoke, Hawthorne claimed, one could read the future in hisface, seeing “mankind… arise a Titan, and grasp the secrets of the skies. I sawa coming time when the race would no longer be forced to labor for the means oflivelihood, when the terms rich and poor would no longer mean difference ofmaterial conditions, but of spiritual capacity and ambition; a time . . . even,when knowledge should be derived from sources now hardly imagined….”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos910730]Tesla displayed occasional streaks of cruelty that seemed motivated by likes anddislikes of an almost compulsive sort. Fat people disgusted him, and he madelittle effort to conceal his feelings. One of his secretaries was in his opiniontoo fat. Once she awkwardly knocked something off a table and he fired her. Shepleaded with him on plump knees to change his mind but he refused to do so. Hehad a favorite joke about two of his ancient aunts that centered on the factthat both were sublimely ugly.He could be equally imperious about his subordinates’ clothes. A secretary mightspend half a month’s earnings on a new dress, and he would criticize it,ordering her to go home and change it before delivering a message to one of hisimportant banker friends.His employees seemed never to question his assumed role as an arbiter of tasteand in fact were singularly loyal to him. Other qualities compensated. Hisassistants Kolman Czito and George Scherff, his secretaries Muriel Arbus andMiss Skerritt, stayed with him through thick times and thin. When he grew oldand rambling, journalists would protect him from his own utterances. The sciencewriters Kenneth M. Swezey and O’Neill, mere teenagers when they met him, came toworship him almost as a god. Hugo Gernsback, the famous science editor and afather of science fiction, would publish everything he could get of Tesla’s,considering him at least as important as Edison.This strangely captivating figure was to be courted not only by writers,industrialists, and financiers, but by musicians, actors, kings, poets,university trustees, mystics, and crackpots. Honors would be showered upon him;foreign governments would seek his services. People were to call him a wizard, avisionary, a prophet, a prodigal genius, and the greatest scientist of all time.But that was not all.Some called him a faker and a charlatan, just as at times they defamed Edisonwhen he too “went public” with his inventions and bragged precipitously to thepress. Fellow scientists in the universities would never forgive Tesla this sin.Edison’s fame outlived such charges, for he took the wise precaution ofacquiring a fortune and power as well as a vast popular following. But Tesla’sdollars would slip away like sand, and he would have to stand alone, aloof andindifferent to public opinion.One harsh critic, Waldemar Kaempffert, science editor of The New York Times, wasto brand him “an intellectual boa constrictor” in whose coils such innocents asJ. P. Morgan and Colonel Astor had been as helpless prey. Kaempffert woulddescribe him as a “medieval practitioner of black arts… as vague as an orientalmystic,” and accuse him (mixing the historical metaphor) of being a hopelesslyretrograde Victorian, unable to accept the new atomic science of the twentiethcentury. His fellow journalists, sniffed Kaempffert, “though they could notunderstand what [Tesla] was talking about, were enthralled with his proposals tocommunicate with Mars and to transmit power without wires over vast distances.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos910876] And hestrongly intimated that among the duped journalists was his opposite number onthe Herald Tribune. O’Neill gave Tesla far too much credit, Kaempffert said, asa result of adolescent hero worship. O’Neill had met Tesla while working as apage in the New York Public Library and allegedly wrote poems to him.Kaempffert’s attitude was perhaps explained by the following incident describedby O’Neill:In 1898 Tesla made a celebrated demonstration in Madison Square Garden of aremotely controlled robot boat and torpedoes. Kaempffert, then a student at CityCollege, brashly engaged the famous scientist in conversation.“I see how you could load an even larger boat with a cargo of dynamite,” hevolunteered, “cause it to ride submerged, and explode the dynamite whenever youwished by pressing the key just as easily as you can cause the light on the bowto shine, and blow up from a distance by wireless even the largest ofbattleships.”Tesla snapped back, “You do not see there a wireless torpedo. You see there thefirst of a race of robots, mechanical men which will do the laborious work ofthe human race.”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos911120]Envious scientists and critical journalists were not to be the only sources ofTesla’s travail. Occultists seemed attracted to him, and odd men and womenpreoccupied with even stranger matters flocked to his banner, proclaiming himtheir very own Venusian. He had been born on Venus, they insisted, and arrivedon Earth either by spaceship or on the wings of a large white dove.9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos911281]These unwelcome followers believed him to be a man of prophecy and great psychicpower who “fell to Earth” to uplift ordinary mortals through the development ofautomation. Partly to discourage all who would attribute abnormal powers to him,Tesla went to great lengths to deny even the sensory gifts he actuallypossessed. In the same spirit, he went farther than that, expounding hismechanistic philosophy, proclaiming that human beings were without wills oftheir own, their every act the result of external events and circumstances.10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos911511] Despiteall his disclaimers, however, the strange champions continued to follow him,sometimes linking his name with unfortunate publicity schemes. Who but acharlatan, it was asked, would attract such people?One autumn evening Tesla’s hansom cab deposited him at the fashionable home ofthe Robert Underwood Johnsons’ at 327 Lexington Avenue. Arc lights sparkled inthe frosty air as cabriolets, broughams, and other smart carriages delivered acareful assortment of guests. From the opened door drifted the strains of aMozart piano concerto. The Johnsons were not wealthy, but they evenhandedlyaccumulated millionaires, supermillionaires, poor artists, and intellectuals.Neither Robert nor Katharine understood much about science but they both adoredTesla for his varied charms.They were an attractive couple, he scholarly in appearance with a gift forlanguages, poetry, and repartee, Katharine petite and pretty, yet toointelligent and restless to be satisfied with her wife-and-mother role.In addition to cultivating artists, they were genuinely interested in the arts.Johnson was the associate editor of Century magazine and later became itseditor. Their home became a natural haven for the cultured Tesla, who missed thecivilized rituals of Old World cities. Both he and Michael Pupin, although theycame from the poorest backgrounds in Yugoslavia, had been appalled when theyfirst confronted the vulgar clamor of America. At the Johnson home Tesla metprominent Continental artists, writers, and political figures as well as thecream of American society.He was introduced to the Johnsons in 1893 by Thomas Commer-ford Martin, andliked them immediately. Soon the trio became fast friends. With Robert andKatharine, Tesla learned to relax his formal manners, to use first names, andeven to relish the gossip of the times. Tesla’s relentless search formillionaires to finance his inventions became the subject of the trio’s favoritein-joke.When they were not together, they exchanged notes—sometimes two or three times aday—by messenger. Over the years their correspondence amounted to thousands ofletters between Robert and Nikola, but almost equally between Katharine and “Mr.Tesla,” as she unfailingly addressed him even when her notes made no effort toconceal the intensity of her feelings for him. It was not long until Teslaloosened up enough to give them nicknames, calling Johnson “Luka Filipov” aftera legendary Serbian hero he admired, and Mrs. Johnson “Madame Filipov.” Johnson,in return, took up the study of Serbian.The invitations from the Johnsons to Tesla convey an idea of the frenetic sociallife the inventor was leading at this time. “Do drop in if you can on your wayto the Leggett’s from the Van Allen’s. . . .” “Come meet the Kiplings,” “Comesee Paderewski,” “Come to meet Baron Kaneko. . . .” In his acceptances, Teslasometimes signed his notes to the “Filipovs” with such frivolous names such asNicholas I. or the initials “G.I.” (for Great Inventor). With few other friendsdid he feel able to be so playful.Thanks to the Johnsons, Tesla was now also being given access to those specialpreserves of privilege where the Idle Rich played at the game of life with suchsingle-minded ostentation and vulgarity. Robert described for him the banquetsgiven at Delmonico’s by the fabulously wealthy. They were called Silver, Gold,and Diamond dinners, depending upon which kind of jewelry was to be tucked intothe napkins to surprise the women guests. Sometimes, for a taste thrill,cigarettes made of hundred dollar bills were passed around and smoked.And if he did not attend it, the inventor most certainly read in the societypages of the bizarre soiree called the Poverty Social. The event in question wasgiven in the brownstone mansion of a western hides-and-tallow king. Guests werecommanded to show up in dirty rags. They sat on a filthy floor, swilling beerfrom tin cans and eating scraps of food served to them by liveried footmen, onwooden plates. Sensitivity was not one of the hallmarks of the Gilded Age.But questions of taste aside, wealth had its undeniable attractions. “The onlyway I shall ever have a cent,” said Tesla, “is when I have enough money to throwit out of the window in handfuls.”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos911673]At this time he was living at the Gerlach, which declared itself on itsletterhead to be a “strictly fireproof family hotel.” He chafed in theseunglamorous surroundings and dreamed of the Waldorf on Fifth Avenue with itsheavily gold-embossed stationery.At the Johnson home, in addition to being introduced to Rudyard Kipling, whom heand Robert considered one of the great poets of the age, he met the writers JohnMuir and Helen Hunt Jackson, the composers Ignace Paderewski and Anton Dvořák,the prima donna Nellie Melba, and a parade of socialites and politicians,including Senator George Hearst.12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos911840] He alsomet an unknown but strikingly handsome southerner just graduated from the U.S.Naval Academy, Richmond Pearson Hobson.Tesla was already thirty-seven and a cosmopolitan, not easily impressed by newacquaintances. But he felt curiously attracted to the young officer whose boyishfeatures were in such absurd contrast to the dark, swashing mustache heaffected. Hobson was to come as close as any Serbian hero to Tesla’s ideal—thevirile, romantic man of action who combined native intelligence with a culturedbackground.Among the animadversions against Tesla were whispers that he was a homosexual.In another time or another country it might have made little difference to hiscareer; but in Victorian America, in the sober company of engineers, such rumorswere to become a virulent part of the arsenal of his enemies. Since he couldnever be bothered to repudiate gossip of any kind, at any time, the onlyexplanation he ever cared to advance for his celibacy was the exclusive demandsimposed by his work. This, however, was unacceptable to the society of the time,and the pressures upon him to marry were unrelenting.On the face of it, Tesla’s phobias made him an unlikely candidate for intimaterelationships. He did, however, at one period maintain an apartment at theluxurious Hotel Marguery on the west side of Park Avenue between 47th and 48thstreets at the same time that his residence was at another hotel; and he oncetold Kenneth Swezey that he used it for meeting “special” friends andacquaintances. The statement, however, is open to many interpretations.The Johnsons introduced him to a parade of women who were comely, talented, orrich, and sometimes all three. A fair number were said to be sexually attractedto him. He never responded in kind, but such attentions obviously gratified hisego.On the autumn evening when he arrived at the Johnson home to hear the strains ofMozart drifting from the door, he recognized the pianist as MargueriteMerington, one of his perennial favorites as a dinner partner. The admirationand affection he felt for her appeared to be as much as he was ever to feel forany woman.He was taken by Johnson to meet a tall, serious girl wearing an expensive Frenchgown, modishly cinched in at the waist, with lace and a flower at the neckline.As she turned, her tawny eyes startled him. He was sure he had not met her, yethe had seen those eyes. An actress, perhaps?“Miss Anne Morgan,” said Johnson. “Mr. Tesla.” Then he left them.She nodded and returned her attention to the music. Tesla was amused. Of course.Her eyes had the same bold intelligence as her father’s. He could almostvisualize her lighting up a black cigar. Johnson had said the girl was in lovewith him. If so, she seemed determined not to betray it. Her poise, cultivatedat so-called dames’ schools, impressed him. So rich and yet so lovely.What a pity, though, that the girl wore pearl earrings; they almost set histeeth on edge. He would have enjoyed talking with her, but the pearls made itimpossible. Perhaps Robert would be kind enough to drop her a hint for thefuture. According to Elisabeth Marbury, Anne had been so overprotected as to bealmost pathetically childlike. But if Tesla was any judge, the self-possessedcreature before him would very soon be shedding her cocoon. Her metamorphosiswould be interesting to watch.The Johnsons, as he realized, were bound to tease him if he did not promptlydisplay an interest in marrying the daughter of J. Pierpont Morgan. For anambitious inventor in need of capital, he recognized the pitfalls in thesituation. He could not decently encourage the young woman in her infatuation,but he must be extremely diplomatic to avoid hurting her feelings.When the music ended, others claimed his attention. At parties these days he wasalways quickly surrounded. People longed to hang upon the words of the giftedspellbinder. The wealthy tended not to be scientifically critical, and Teslarelieved their boredom. He in turn enjoyed letting his fancies fly.On the evening in question he made an excuse and sought out Marguerite whosecandor he appreciated. Complimenting her on her performance, he asked somewhattactlessly, “Tell me, Miss. Why do you not wear diamonds and jewelry like theothers?”“It is not a matter of choice with me,” she said. “But if I had enough money toload myself with diamonds, I could think of better ways of spending it.”“What would you do with money if you had it?” he asked with interest.“I would prefer to purchase a home in the country, except that I would not enjoycommuting from the suburbs.”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos912007]Tesla beamed. Fancy a charming and talented woman who rejected jewels. Hehimself never wore even a tiepin or a watch chain.“Ah, Miss Merington, when I start getting my millions,” he said, “I will solvethat problem. I will buy a square block here in New York and build a villa foryou in the center and plant trees all around it. Then you will have your countryhome and will not have to leave the city.”14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos912179]She laughed, briefly wondering, perhaps, if this were some kind of proposition.But it is unlikely she could have concluded that Tesla’s words were anything butbanter.According to one of the inventor’s close friends, Marguerite later claimed to bethe only woman who ever touched Tesla. The friend discounted it. No record ofintimacy linking her or any other woman to the inventor has ever beendiscovered.The same confidante said that Anne Morgan “threw herself” at Tesla. Again thereis nothing to support the belief that they were more than friends. They were toenjoy parallel careers, Anne becoming a most vital and important woman in herown right. Although her name would be linked with a succession of famous men,she would never marry.Periodically to repay his social debts Tesla gave elaborate banquets at theWaldorf for members of the “400” and lesser mortals. Invitations were jealouslysought for these splendid affairs. He personally selected the choicest foods andliquors, supervised their preparation, hovered over the sauces, and anguishedover the vintage wines. No cost was spared, and no plebeians were invited.After such affairs the guests were titillated by visits to his laboratory forprivate “showings,” and many a prophetic announcement appeared in the next day’spapers about his exciting inventions. He could not have chosen a more tellingway to torment those of his scientific contemporaries who were excluded fromsuch performances.But still his relative indifference to women continued to be a subject ofinternational gossip. One night as he sat in the Café de la Paix in Paris with aFrench scientist, a theater party passed that included the divine SarahBernhardt. The actress coyly dropped her handkerchief. He sprang to his feet andreturned it to her without so much as raising his eyes and at once, to thedismay of the Frenchman, resumed his discussion of electricity.Even the Electrical Review of London (August 14, 1896) devoted a lengthyeditorial to chiding him: “Of course Mr. Tesla may be quite invulnerable toCupid’s shafts, but somehow or other we doubt it. We are great admirers of himand his work, and we give him credit for good hard sense…. We have faith enoughin women to believe that his fate will come, and that some one will be found whois not only a match for his intensity in all respects, but who will tax hisinventive genius to the utmost: for example, in trying to explain where he wasat 2 o’clock some night…. Whatever may be the cause of the abnormal condition inwhich this distinguished scientist finds himself, we hope that it will soon beremoved, for we are certain that science in general, and Mr. Tesla inparticular, will be all the richer when he gets married.”The absurd quidnunc who wrote this editorial would never, of course, live to seehis prophecy fulfilled. But neither would he be disappointed in Tesla’s futurescientific and technical achievements, for the inventor was shortly to embark onone of the most extraordinary phases of his altogether extraordinary career.The event that signaled this new turn in Tesla’s fortunes was anotherlong-distance telephone call from George Westinghouse. It was wonderful,astonishing news. The inventor quickly packed his bags and boarded a train forNiagara Falls."},{"pageContent":"9. HIGH ROAD, LOW ROAD It seemed almost too much success in such a short period. The Niagara FallsCommission, which for years had been swayed by the direful arguments of Edisonand Lord Kelvin about the dangers of alternating current, announced in October1893—just as Westinghouse had predicted—that it was awarding to his firm thecontract to build the first two generators at Niagara.The War of the Currents that had divided American industry so long andrancorously was to be settled with a victory for Tesla’s system of AC andWestinghouse’s perseverance.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos912474] Nodoubt this had resulted in large part from the unassailable visual testimony oftheir exhibitions at the Chicago World’s Fair.The war was to end with a compromise: General Electric was given the contractfor building transmission and distribution lines from Niagara Falls to Buffalo.Both firms had submitted a proposal to install a Tesla polyphase generatingsystem, for GE had obtained a license to use the Tesla patents and proposed toinstall a three-phase system. The Westinghouse proposal was for two-phase.In 1895 the powerhouse was completed by Westinghouse and ready to deliver 15,000horsepower of electricity, a truly phenomenal achievement for the times. Thefollowing year GE completed the transmission and distribution lines, enablingpower to surge across twenty-six miles to run the lights and streetcars ofBuffalo.The harnessing of Niagara Falls proceeded on schedule. People spoke reverentlyof it as one of the official wonders of the world. Westinghouse built seven moregenerating units, which raised the production of electricity to 50,000horsepower. General Electric constructed a second powerhouse that also usedalternating current and built eleven more generators.Another historic first soon followed. AC was delivered to one of its earliestand most significant customers, the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, which laterbecame the Aluminum Company of America, or Alcoa.2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos912693] The newmetallurgical industry had been waiting for the high voltages that AC alonecould supply. As Tesla had predicted, aluminum manufacture would soon permit thedevelopment of an aircraft industry.An astounding aspect of the War of the Currents is that, like an ancientreligious feud, it is still being waged. Anyone reading the national advertisingcampaign launched by General Electric in the late 1970s would have erroneouslyconcluded that GE alone harnessed Niagara Falls and that Tesla was merely analso-ran among inventors.Gardner H. Dales of the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, addressing theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) on April 5, 1956, recollectedmore accurately:“If there ever was a man who created so much and whose praises were sung solittle—it was Nikola Tesla. It was his invention, the polyphase system, and itsfirst use by the Niagara Falls Power Company that laid the foundation for thepower system used in this country and throughout the entire world today….”Actually, however, Tesla’s praises were well sung at this period and only laterwould it become convenient for the beneficiaries of his genius to growforgetful. In the 1890s his name and achievements were almost constantly inheadlines.Newspapers and engineering journals alike saluted him. The New York Timesdeclared that he owned the “undisputed honor” of making the Niagara enterprisepossible, a sentiment echoed by George Forbes in Electricity (October 2, 1895).The achievement was covered widely in the world press. The Prince of Montenegroconferred upon him the Order of the Eagle. The coveted Elliott-Cresson Medal wasawarded to him by the AIEE for his researches in high-frequency phenomena. AndLord Kelvin, now generous in his praise, declared that the inventor had“contributed more to electrical science than any man up to his time.”Soon alternating-current power systems were being built in New York City for theelevated and street railways, for steam-railway electrification, and were evenbeing extended to the Edison substations.Nevertheless the inventor and Westinghouse continued to be torn and worried bysore losers. The company defended its alternating-current patents in some twentycourt actions—including the one alluded to earlier that was determined by theU.S. Supreme Court—in each of which Westinghouse won a decisive victory. Itfiled actions against General Electric and others, and these too weresuccessful. But as mentioned earlier, so much litigation created publicconfusion and left unhappy men. Some of these who had once praised Tesla now didtheir best to damage him.B. A. Behrend, later vice-president of the AIEE and an acute observer of thecontemporary scene, wrote: “It is a peculiar trait of ignorant men to go alwaysfrom one extreme to another, and those who were once the blind admirers of Mr.Tesla, exalting him to an extent which can be likened only to the infatuatedpraise bestowed on victims of popular admiration, are now eagerly engaged in hisderision.”Behrend found this deeply melancholy.“I can never think of Nikola Tesla,” he added, “without warming up to my subjectand condemning the injustice and ingratitude which he has received alike at thehands of the public and of the engineering profession.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos912856]Weary of the bickering and backbiting, the inventor returned to New York, moredetermined than ever to protect his time, aching to follow up half a dozen linesof research.He began to achieve effects with high-voltage equipment that opened an infinityof possibilities. By learning to create artificial lightning he hoped not onlyto discover how to control the world’s weather but also how to transmit energywithout wires. And this in turn meshed with research that he hoped would enablehim to build the first worldwide broadcasting system.Gratifying results came when he achieved tensions of about one million voltsusing a conical coil. Instinctively he felt that instead of going to larger andlarger apparatus for high voltages, he might accomplish the same thing with theproper design of a comparatively small and compact transformer.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos913097] Thisproblem obsessed him, but not exclusively.If some spectacular experiment seemed to defy the most elemental laws ofelectricity, Tesla cheerfully followed wherever it led. Sometimes it led instrange directions.The radio tube, which involves the conduction of current through a vacuum, is,practically speaking, the original electronic device. Its accidental ancestorwas a vacuum lamp invented by Edison in 1883. He was puzzled by what came to beknown as the Edison Effect but saw no value in it; other scientists such as SirWilliam Preece, J. A. Fleming, Tesla, Elihu Thomson, and J. J. Thomson, however,were most interested. J. J. Thomson figured out that the observed phenomenon wascaused by the emission of negative electricity, or electrons, passing from thehot element to the cold electrode. Edison, still puzzled and disappointed at nothaving found a good lamp, reported that the effect seemed to “impress some ofthe bulge-headed fraternity of the Savanic World.” He himself moved on to morepressing concerns.Tesla had begun developing vacuum tubes in the early 1890s, fully expecting themto be suitable for detecting the transmission of radio signals. Later he engageda full-time glass blower and invented thousands of versions which he used bothin radio research and for the production of light.It was Fleming who, after studying the work of Edison and Preece, successfullyapplied the Edison Effect to the detection of radio signals, achieving increasedsensitivity over the crystal detectors then used. In 1907 Lee De Forest wouldadd the grid or control element to the Fleming diode, calling it the Audion, andthe science of modern electronics would be fairly launched.Yet long before this, Tesla was describing his work with vacuum bulbs andhigh-frequency currents, sharing his own fascination and puzzlement with hislecture audiences. Thus one day he placed a long glass tube, partiallyevacuated, within a longer copper tube with a closed end. A slit was cut in thecopper tube to disclose the glass within. When he connected the copper to ahigh-frequency terminal, he found the air in the inner tube brilliantly lightedalthough no current seemed to be flowing through the short-circuiting coppershell. The electricity, it seemed, preferred to flow through the glass byinduction and pass through the low-pressure air rather than traversing the metalpath of the outer tube.In this the inventor saw a way of transmitting electric impulses, of anyfrequency in gases. “Could the frequency be brought high enough,” he speculated,“then a queer system of distribution, which would be likely to interest gascompanies, might be realized; metal pipes filled with gas—the metal being theinsulator and the gas the conductor—supplying phosphorescent bulbs, or perhapsdevices not yet invented.”In fact, what he was describing was the ancestor of the wave guide for microwavetransmission.Tesla was led by this line of exploration to one of his most grandioseconceptions, the “terrestrial night light”—a way of lighting the whole Earth andits surrounding atmosphere, as though it were but a single illumination. Hetheorized that the gases in the atmosphere at high altitudes were in the samecondition as the air in his partially evacuated tubes and hence would serve asexcellent conductors of high-frequency currents. The concept intrigued him formany years. He saw it as a means of making shipping lanes and airports safer atnight, or as a way of illuminating whole cities without the use of streetlights. One had only to transmit sufficient high-frequency currents in the rightform to the upper air, at an altitude of 35,000 feet or even lower. When askedhow he proposed to conduct his currents to the upper air, he merely replied thatit did not present any practical difficulties. It was his habit never todisclose methods until he had tested them in practice, and this was one of hisideas that was to be put aside for lack of research capital.Journalists continued to question him and to speculate. Some suggested that heplanned to use one of his molecular bombardment tubes to project a powerful beamof ultraviolet rays into the atmosphere, ionizing the air through greatdistances and making it a good conductor of electricity of all kinds at highvoltages. This, they theorized, would provide a conducting path to any desiredheight through which he could send high-frequency currents.5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos913258] Later,when his great (and ill-fated) world-broadcasting tower was built on LongIsland, the upper platform was designed to receive a bank of powerfulultraviolet lamps. Their purpose was never revealed.At other times, Tesla talked of a plan for using both Earth and upper air asconductors of electricity and the stratum of air between as an insulator. Thiscombination would form a kind of gigantic condenser, a means of storing anddischarging electricity. If the Earth were electrically excited, the upper airwould be charged by induction. The globe would be transformed into a Leyden jar,charging and discharging. A current flowing both in the ground and in the upperair would create a luminous upper stratum that would light the world. Was thishow Tesla proposed to get his currents into the upper air? We do not know.In his London lectures of 1892 he had lingered fondly over the description of amost peculiar and sensitive vacuum tube he had invented. Under the influence ofa high-frequency current it would shoot off a ray that behaved with strangesensitivity to electrostatic and magnetic influences. With this tube he couldmake curious experiments.When the bulb hung straight down from a wire and all objects were remote fromit, Tesla could by approaching it cause the ray to fly to the opposite side ofthe bulb; and if he walked around the bulb the ray would always be on theopposite side of it. Sometimes the ray would begin to spin wildly around thebulb. With a small permanent magnet he could slow down or accelerate thespinning according to the position of the magnet. When most sensitive to themagnet, however, it was less sensitive to electrostatic influence. He could notmake even the slightest motion such as stiffening the muscles of his hand,without causing visible reaction in the ray.Tesla believed it was formed by an irregularity in the glass that prevented itfrom passing equally on all sides. Fascinated, he believed such a tool would bea valuable aid to investigating the nature of force fields.“If there is any motion which is measurable going on in space,” he said, “such abrush ought to reveal it. It is, so to speak, a beam of light, frictionless,devoid of inertia.“I think that it may find practical applications in telegraphy. With such abrush it would be possible to send dispatches across the Atlantic, for instance,with any speed, since its sensitiveness may be so great that the slightestchanges will affect it. If it were possible to make the stream more intense andvery narrow, its deflections could be easily photographed.”He had closed his lecture with the comment: “The wonder is that, with thepresent state of knowledge and the experiences gained, no attempt is being madeto disturb the electrostatic or magnetic condition of the Earth, and transmit,if nothing else, intelligence….”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos913429]The little vacuum tube, however, was not to figure usefully in his plans as adetector of electrical disturbances or radio signals from a distance. Itremained a curiosity item. When used by Tesla as a detector it was so difficultto adjust that it was unsuitable except for laboratory research.But today, now that science has begun to take an interest in little-understoodbiological phenomena, Tesla’s strange vacuum tube may hold new interest. Itcould, for example, have application in the control of autonomic functions ofthe body through biofeedback techniques. Or perhaps it might help us tounderstand the mysterious Kirlian effect. Kirlian photography, used inconjunction with high-frequency voltages of a Tesla coil, has created scientificinterest in the human aura by disclosing to ordinary vision what may always havebeen apparent to psychics. Tesla’s 1890s research showed that high-frequencycurrents move on or near the surface of conducting materials, similarly to thephenomenon of superconductivity. It has been speculated that coronas appearingin Kirlian photographs may be the modulation of some kind of “carrier field”surrounding life forms. (Acupuncture points also may be related to such forcefields.) It is thus possible to entertain the suggestion of a contemporaryelectrical engineer that Tesla’s hypersensitive vacuum tube might make anexcellent detector not only of Kirlian auras but of other so-called paranormalphenomena, including the entities commonly called ghosts.Since his return to New York, Tesla had lived almost a hermit’s existence. Onlyon the most tempting social occasions were the inventor’s friends any longerable to lure him from his laboratory. The late night fun and games had stopped.Robert and Katharine Johnson worried about him, warning him that all work and noplay could bring on another breakdown.Katharine found the winter of 1893 passing slowly without his frequent company.In icy January she sent flowers to him in appreciation of some gesture. He foundtime to send her an article by Professor Crookes and a Crookes radiometer, alittle heat-powered windmill that spun in an evacuated bulb, and which heconsidered (or said he did) “the most beautiful invention made.” These smallwindmills, embodying in their simplicity Tesla’s ideal of an elegant solution,may still be seen, in the windows of novelty shops, their blades silently“fanned” by the sun.Although science was not her favorite subject, Katharine felt flattered andpleased. On a stormy afternoon in February she and Robert sat before an openfire, she feeling bored and restless. On the spur of the moment she wrote a noteto Tesla and sent it off by messenger: “What are you doing these stormy days? We. . . are wondering if anybody is coming in this evening to cheer us up, sayabout 9, or at 7 for dinner. We are very dull and very very comfortable beforean open fire, but two is too small a number. For congeniality there must bethree, especially when it snows ‘in my country.’ Is that wonderful machine inorder again and are you ready for the photographers and the thunderbolts andJuno and all the lesser gods and goddesses tomorrow? Come and tell us. We shalllook for you, at 7 or 9.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos913587] But themachine was not in order, and the Johnsons were disappointed, Robert as much asKatharine.Later in the spring of 1894, however, his experiments were far enough along forTesla to invite Johnson, Joseph Jefferson, Marion Crawford, and Twain to thelaboratory to “take high-voltage sparks through their bodies” and to pose forthe first photographs ever taken by gaseous tube lights.Despite his absorption in science, it was characteristic of Tesla that he foundtime in May to write an article for Johnson’s Century magazine on ZmajJovanovich, the chief Serbian poet. And the following spring he would be back inthe pages of that journal with an article on his favorite hero, Luka Filipov.Later on in the year he would give John Foord of The New York Times a majorarticle (September 30, 1894) in which, in addition to describing his theory oflight, matter, ether, and the universe, he claimed that 90 percent of the energyin electric lights was wasted and that in the future there would be no need totransmit power at all, not even wire-lessly. “I expect to live to be able to seta machine in the middle of this room,” he said, “and move it by no other agencythan the energy of the medium in motion around us.”In this most productive period of his life, it is likely that he was at hishappiest. No intimation of approaching disaster marred his days. He was stillliving restively at the staid Gerlach Hotel, and on its letterhead, in his mostgracious style, he wrote to Katharine, accepting at last an invitation todinner:“Even dining at Delmonico’s is too much of a high life for me and I fear that ifI depart very often from my simple habits I shall come to grief. I had formedthe firm resolve not to accept any invitations, however tempting; but in thismoment I remember that the pleasure of your company will soon be denied to me(as I am unable to follow you to East Hampton where you intend camping out thissummer)—an irresistible desire takes hold of me to become a participant of thatdinner, a desire which no amount of reasoning and consciousness of impendingperil can overcome. In the anticipation of the joys and of probable subsequentsorrows, I remain….”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos913795]In June 1894, a coy message came from Katharine in East Hampton, chiding him for‘ “sending disappointing and cold-blooded telegrams to kind expectant friends.”She added: “‘In my country’ one is never so cruel, especially after high honorswhen friends are longing to felicitate one. But on such occasions one is sogenial and happy one cannot say no to a friend but must wish his friend as happyas himself. This is a friend ‘in my country.’”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos914033] Thehonors to which she alluded were the LL.D. from Columbia College and the Orderof St. Sava from the King of Serbia.Shortly afterward she tried a variation on her usual routine, inviting Tesla andone of his gentleman friends to dinner. But he was firm (and perhaps wary),replying that he would attend provided there was a woman for every man, and saidhe would be pleased if she asked Miss Merington.The summer passed and part of another winter with his friends almost neverseeing him. He was intensely busy and apparently quite content, although perhapssometimes during this period when his research seemed to lead in every directionat once, Tesla might have remembered with a smile Lord Rayleigh’s well-meantadvice about specializing.Then, suddenly disaster struck. At 2:30 in the morning of March 13, 1895, hislaboratory at 33–35 South Fifth Avenue caught fire. The six-story building inwhich it was located was destroyed, the cost to him being incalculable. All theexpensive research apparatus that he and Kolman Czito had so laboriously builtcrashed right through from the fourth floor to the second where it came to rest,a mass of molten, reeking metal.10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos914241]Nothing was insured. But even had it been, it could not have covered his losses.Indeed, a million dollars, as he later said, could not have compensated for theresulting setbacks in his research. Stunned, sickened, he turned away from theruins in the cold early morning and wandered through the streets in a trance,paying no attention to where he was or to the passing of time. The Johnsonsfrantically searched for him in his familiar haunts.Newspapers all over the world reported the tragedy: “Work of half a lifetimegone.” “Fruits of Genius Swept Away.” In London the Electrical World reportedthat the greatest loss was the physical collapse of the inventor.11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos914496] CharlesA. Dana of the New York Sun paid him the highest tribute: “The destruction ofNikola Tesla’s workshop, with its wonderful contents, is something more than aprivate calamity. It is a misfortune to the whole world. It is not in any degreean exaggeration to say that the men living at this time who are more importantto the human race than this young gentleman can be counted on the fingers of onehand; perhaps on the thumb of one hand.”12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos914677]Only his closest assistants knew the dazzling scope of his advanced researchesin radio, wireless transmission of energy, and guided vehicles, or that he wasachieving effects with what the world would soon know as X rays, and alsonearing a breakthrough in the potentially lucrative industrial discovery of ameans of producing liquid oxygen. It may have been the latter volatile substancethat caused the blaze—apparently started from a gas jet on the first floor nearoil-soaked rags—to explode so rapidly through the entire building.An emotional letter from Katharine, written the day after the fire, finallyreached him. She told of their search and the hope of consoling him in his“irreparable loss.”“It seemed as if you too must have dissipated into thin air…. Do let us see youagain in the flesh that this awful thought may vanish,” she implored. “Todaywith the deepening realization of the meaning of this disaster and consequentlywith increasing anxiety for you, my dear friend, I am even poorer except intears, and they cannot be sent in letters. Why will you not come to usnow—perhaps we might help you, we have so much to give in sympathy….”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos914870]The degree to which this strangely unresponsive man had begun to affect her lifeand happiness was no longer a question in her mind."},{"pageContent":"10. AN ERROR OF JUDGMENT At this crucial point in his life Tesla, for all his worldwide fame, was closeto being broke. The destroyed laboratory of the Tesla Electric Company was ownedin part by A. K. Brown and another associate. There were no longer any royaltiesfrom his alternating-current patents in America, nor any salary fromWestinghouse. He had invested everything he owned in equipment for research. Hisonly current resources were royalties from German patents on his polyphasemotors and dynamos, which were a drop in the bucket compared to what he wouldneed to rebuild and refurnish a laboratory.He was not downcast for long, however, consoling himself with the fact that hisongoing research was still vivid in his mind and that the loss was merely asetback.To the rescue came Edward Dean Adams, the financier who had organized theInternational Niagara Commission when competing technologies were being examinedfor the harnessing of Niagara Falls. He was also president of the Morgan-backedCataract Construction Company which, holding the charter for development ofpower at the Falls, had chosen Tesla’s polyphase system. Hence he was wellacquainted with the inventor’s record and impressed by his genius.Adams proposed not only to form a new company for his continued research, with acapitalization of $500,000, but he himself offered to subscribe to $100,000 instock. For starters he gave Tesla $40,000.The inventor at once began combing New York City for a new laboratory and soonfound a location at 46 East Houston Street. He had a telephone installed (Spring299) and began firing off a barrage of oral and written SOS’s to Westinghousefor replacement machinery.To Albert Schmid, general superintendent of the Pittsburgh headquarters, hewrote: “You will greatly oblige me if you will do what is in your power to shipwhat is required with the least possible delay.” And again: “Let me knowimmediately . . . what is the smallest size rotating two-phase transformer youhave in stock….”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos915228]Only days later he asked that the machinery be sent by costly express ratherthan as freight, being in an agony to get on with interrupted research,especially in wireless, or radio, where the international race had alreadybegun.Both Edison and William H. Preece, head of the British Postal Telegraph System,had been working with primitive “wireless” that used an inductive effect. Thatis to say, Edison had sent a message from a moving train via a telegraph wirestrung on poles along the track, bridging the intervening feet by induction. Butsuch systems could work only over short distances, and Edison hadcharacteristically lost interest.More to the point, Sir Oliver Lodge just the previous year had transmitted Morsesignals between two buildings at Oxford University, a distance of severalhundred feet. He had built a transmitter and receiver by putting a Hertz sparkgap in a copper cylinder open at one end, thereby producing a beam ofultra-short-wave oscillations.Tesla explained to the Westinghouse superintendent that the machinery he wasordering was to be used in connection with his oscillators and a high efficiencywas important. “Please,” he pleaded, “do not spare any pains of expense. I shallrely as to the price entirely on the fairness of the Westinghouse Company. Ibelieve that there are gentlemen in that company who believe in a hereafter.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos915428]Assurances came from the vice-president and general manager that the equipmentwas being shipped and that the price would be as low as possible. After all, asTesla occasionally reminded them, they benefited from valuable promotion when heused their equipment for his demonstrations.To Schmid he wrote again, exhorting him to make the rotary transformer excellentin every way. To C. F. Scott, chief electrician at Pittsburgh, he urged that theschedule for building the transformer be advanced: “My work has been suddenlyinterrupted just as I was at the most interesting stage of the development ofcertain ideas, and I need very much my apparatus to begin work anew.”Only weeks later Scott received another message in the same vein of urgency:“This kind of work is almost essential to my health, and I hope that itsresumption will have a good effect upon me.”Even while buying equipment Tesla was mulling over the tempting offer of EdwardDean Adams to join forces in a new company that would mean the powerfulfinancial backing of the House of Morgan. But he was very leery of it, havingseen the Morgan takeover of both the Thomson-Houston Company and the EdisonElectric Company to form General Electric. And he remembered well how they hadcoveted and threatened the autonomy of Westinghouse. So he made one of his manyerrors of judgment in finance, accepting the $40,000 from Adams but rejectingthe larger alliance.His good friend Johnson was only one of those who thought him mistaken forcutting himself off from the security represented by the House of Morgan. Teslasighed, spread his long hands expressively, and spoke of protecting his preciousfreedom. Undoubtedly he believed that with the $40,000 he could bring tocommercial stage at least some of the inventions on which he was currentlynearing success. As usual, however, he underestimated the time and the costsinvolved.“No other discovery within my lifetime,” Michael Pupin wrote, “had ever arousedthe interest of the world as did the discovery of the X rays. Every physicistdropped his own research problems and rushed headlong into the research….”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos915627]Roentgen announced his discovery in December 1895. Edison, mired in a perennialand ultimately disastrous effort to mine ores magnetically, quickly sent a wireto a former associate, urging him to drop everything and join a group toexperiment on “Rotgens” (sic) new radiations. “We could do a lot before othersget their second wind,” he said.The opportunity to see the internal structure of the human body captivatedeveryone, and it was obvious to scientists and engineers that some sort offluoroscopic screen would be needed to register the rays after their passagethrough the body.The ways in which Edison, Pupin, and Tesla severally proceeded with their X-rayresearch were characteristic of their different personalities.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos915848]Edison,seeing where the commercial potential lay, began at once to test variouschemicals and quickly reported that calcium tungstate crystals gave a goodfluorescence on a screen. Then he rushed to the Patent Office.Pupin noted in his diary that American physicists had paid little attention tovacuum-tube discharges and that, to the best of his knowledge, he was the onlyAmerican physicist with any experience. Hence when Roentgen’s discovery had beenannounced, “I was, it seems, better prepared than anybody else in this countryto repeat his experiments and succeeded, therefore, sooner than anybody else onthis side of the Atlantic.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos916321] Heclaimed to have obtained the first X ray in the United States on January 2,1896, two weeks after the discovery was announced by Roentgen in Germany.This was curious in view of Tesla’s pioneer love affair with vacuum tubes, whichhe had demonstrated in his series of lectures in 1891, 1892, and 1893. AlthoughTesla always gave full priority to Roentgen, he had spoken then of both “visibleand invisible” rays when demonstrating his molecular-bombardment lamp and othergaseous lamps, and he was using uranium glass and a variety of phosphorescentand fluorescent substances for detecting radiation. During experiments hecarried on in the fall of 1894 with the assistance of the Manhattanphotographers Tonnelé & Company on the radiant power of phosphorescent bodies,“a great number of plates showed curious marks and defects.” It was just as hewas beginning to explore the nature of these phenomena that his laboratoryburned down.6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos916469]When Professor Roentgen announced his discovery of X rays in December of thatyear, Tesla immediately forwarded shadowgraph pictures to the German, whoreplied: “The pictures are very interesting. If you would only be so kind as todisclose the manner in which you obtained them.”The Pupin claim to have been the first in the United States experimenting withvacuum-tube discharges would have been unlikely even if Tesla had not precededhim. Apparently they were being investigated in numerous laboratories in Americaand Europe, and after Roentgen’s announcement a dozen claims were made to“firsts” in X ray. Tesla never made any such claim in his own behalf. The firstclinical radiograph in North America is said by some to have been made in thebasement of Reid Hall at Dartmouth College on February 4, 1896,7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos916809] by alaboratory assistant.But Edward R. Hewitt, an inventor doing photographic research at this time, hasleft an intriguing anecdote. His own researches “began on the morning whenNikola Tesla took a picture of Mark Twain under a Geissler tube which proved tobe no picture of Twain but a good one of the adjusting screw of the cameralens.”“Neither Tesla nor Hewitt,” wrote Noel F. Busch in Life magazine (July 15,1946), “realized until a few weeks later, when Roentgen announced the discoveryof X rays, that the picture of Twain was in fact an example of X-rayphotography, the first ever made in the U.S.” This is, of course, hardly proofof priority of invention, which includes much more than achieving accidentaleffects, but it does suggest how far advanced Tesla’s research was at this time.Whereas Edison hastened to try to profit from Roentgen’s discovery and Pupin wasquick to try to share in its glory, Tesla’s less self-interested response was tobegin an exhaustive series of experiments in X-ray phenomena and technique, theresults of which he published, beginning in March 1896, in a series of articlesin the Electrical Review.8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos917037]While his competitors were using Roentgen tubes for the production of weakshadows of hands and feet, Tesla claimed to be making forty-minute photographsthrough the human skull at forty feet. If this were true, he would have to havebeen using equipment far more advanced than anything we now believe existed atthat time.On April 6, 1896, Professor Pupin reported to the New York Academy of Sciences:“Every substance when subjected to the action of the X rays becomes a radiatorof these rays,” and thus claimed to have discovered secondary radiation. ButTesla had already publicly reported in the Electrical Review (March 18, 1896):“I have lately obtained shadows by reflected rays only,” and described how hehad excluded direct rays to obtain this effect. In testing various kinds ofmetals, he discovered that the most electropositive made the best “reflectors”of Roentgen rays.Many competitors had now entered the field, including such well-known inventorsas A. E. Kennelly and Edwin J. Houston, who used a simple form of Tesla coil toproduce Roentgen rays. The practical Edison, delighted by the public’senthusiasm, made a number of fluoro-scopes in the form of boxes with peepholesand placed them on display at the Electrical Exposition of 1896 at the GrandCentral Palace in New York. This was the first opportunity Americans had to seetheir skeletal shadows, and they clamored for a place in line. Many weredisappointed at not being allowed to view their brains in action. A gamblerwrote to Edison asking for an X-ray device with which he could play against thefaro bank.9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos917214]Prudes worried about the danger of unscrupulous manufacturers making X-raybinoculars, enabling voyeurs to strip them naked as they strolled in Sundayfinery along Fifth Avenue. Well into the 1940s the foot X-ray machine in shoestores would provide a consumer come-on for small-town America.On the theory that blindness might be cured with X rays, numerous “treatments”were given by doctors. To the contrary, as is now known, radiation can cause“flashes” in the eye and, with overexposure, cataracts. Tesla pointed out thatno evidence whatever existed for the blindness “cure” and discouraged thebuilding up of false hopes as cruel. Edison too deplored this yet as a recentbiographer notes, “he jumped in and conducted the tests along with otherscientific men and doctors.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos917371]Tesla’s research, which was fundamental and well-documented, convinced him thatX rays were composed of discrete particles. This proved to be incorrect; but sowere almost everyone else’s theories in this early period. Dr. Lauriston S.Taylor, a radiological physics consultant and recent past president of the NCRP,says, “Nevertheless his reasoning was good and much to his credit.”Almost simultaneously, at Cambridge University in England, the physicist JosephJ. Thomson had built a vacuum tube with two charged plates and a fluorescentscreen. He discovered that the radiation caused by the flow of currents madedots on the screen. Both magnetic and electric fields deflected the rays ofelectricity, which convinced him that they were charged particles. Since theratio of the charge on the particles to their mass was always the same, hehypothesized that he had discovered “matter in a new state” from which all thechemical elements were built up. Some years later Thomson was credited withhaving discovered (in 1897) the electron—a very light particle associated withthe elementary charge of negative electricity and the fundamental building blockof the atom.Max Planck in 1900 proposed a law for electromagnetic radiation— the quantumtheory. And five years later Einstein explained, with his special theory ofrelativity, that all radiation, though it consisted of quanta of differentamounts of energy, traveled at the speed of light. His fundamental equationsdescribed the exchange of energy that took place when radiation and matterinteracted.From this new realm of physics came knowledge of the properties of differentkinds of electromagnetic radiations. Radio waves, at the lowest frequency,stretched for thousands of miles. In the order of rising frequencies camemicrowaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X rays,and gamma rays—the latter incredibly short.Tesla and other early experimenters with X rays were exploring treacherousterritory. It was clear that radiation would be useful in detecting foreignobjects in the body or bone fractures, but its full medical potential and theeffect of such rays on human health entailed dangerous trial-and-error research.“Yet in spite of some grievous accidents with X rays for their first twenty-fiveyears,” says Dr. Taylor, “there were surprisingly few who suffered fromoverexposure—certainly not everyone.”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos917564]Tesla, entranced with the novel and mysterious force, was one of those who atfirst refused to believe there was danger. Convinced he had discovered a way of“stimulating” his brain, he exposed his head repeatedly to radiation.“An outline of the skull is easily obtained with an exposure of 20 to 40minutes,” he wrote. “In one instance an exposure of 40 minutes gave clearly notonly the outline, but the cavity of the eye . . . the lower jaw and connectionsto the upper one, the vertebral column and connections to the skull, the fleshand even the hair.”12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos917735]He noted strange effects: “… a tendency to sleep and the time seems to pass awayquickly. There is a general soothing effect and I have felt a sensation ofwarmth in the upper part of the head. An assistant independently confirmed thetendency to sleep and a quick lapse of time.”From such effects he was more than ever inclined to believe that the radiationwas of material streams penetrating the cranium. And he was first to suggestthat X rays would be used therapeutically—perhaps to “project chemicals into thehuman body.”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos917905]It is difficult to gauge at this date the degree of exposure to which hesubjected himself. And indeed, insofar as the brain is concerned, it is stillnot known what its physiological tolerances are to high-energy radio-frequencyfields.Edison damaged his eyes with X-ray exposure. One of his assistants contracted agradually spreading skin cancer from which he died several years later.Tesla described carefully the effects of X rays upon his own eyes, body, hands,and brain, differentiating between skin burns and what he considered to beinternal effects. In the spring of 1897 he was mysteriously ill for severalweeks. He reported receiving frequent sudden and painful shocks in the eye fromX-ray equipment. His hands were repeatedly exposed.“In a severe case,” he wrote, “the skin gets deeply colored and blackened inplaces, and ugly, ill-foreboding blisters form; thick layers come off, exposingthe raw flesh. . . . Burning pain, feverishness and such symptoms are of coursebut natural accompaniments. One single injury of this kind in the abdominalregion to a dear and zealous assistant—the only accident that ever happened toanyone but myself in all my laboratory experience—I had the misfortune towitness.”14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos918082]This had followed an exposure of five minutes, only a few inches from a highlycharged tube. But apart from skin damage, he noted that such radiation caused afeeling of warmth deep in the flesh, a fact that was to inspire his continuingwork in therapeutics.It is now known that X rays may be of two kinds—“hard” or “soft,” meaning thatthe latter have longer wavelengths and lower energies. They are more easilyabsorbed than hard X rays. Even so they are of high energy compared toultraviolet or visible light rays.Tesla’s research very quickly convinced him that safety measures were needed. Helectured to the New York Academy of Science on April 6, 1897, on the practicalconstruction and safe operation of X-ray equipment as well as reporting hisobservations of the dangers of Roentgen rays. He had already experimented withvarious metal protective devices, and soon thereafter lead shields came intogeneral use.An important figure entered the inventor’s life at this juncture. In preparingfor his Academy of Science lecture he was supplied with lantern slides andcathode tubes by an eager new assistant named George Scherff.At first his secretary, Scherff was to become a financial and legal adviser,bookkeeper, office manager, stockholder, factotum, friend, and during acutefinancial squeezes, a nearly-always-reliable source of small loans. Devotedthrough good times and lean, he was to become Tesla’s most loyal and leastdispensable employee.Scherff never complained about long hours, scanty rewards, or the occasionalthoughtlessness of his boss. If it meant depriving his own family to help Teslaout of a tight spot, the good and frugal Scherff would manage. He neverquestioned the fact that he was always Mr. Scherff, the loyal functionary, neveran intimate or social equal. He truly worshipped Tesla, learned more about hisaffairs than anyone else, and would go to his grave with sealed lips where theinventor’s private matters were concerned. If ever there was a faithful friendstanding behind a great man, it was George Scherff behind Nikola Tesla.Many people continued to worry about why no good woman could be seen standingbehind the celebrated inventor. Important people were expected to procreate forthe good of the country. Urging Tesla to get married in 1896 were not justgossip columnists. Technical journals like the Electrical Review of London, theAmerican Electrician, and the Electrical Journal also took up the hue and cry.Tesla’s expertise in handling such queries is apparent at the end of a longinterview he gave to a reporter for the New York Herald, who came upon him onenight slumped in a café at a late hour, looking haggard and tired. He was stillbrooding at times over the setbacks he had suffered when his laboratory burned,but it was apparent to the reporter from his pallor and the look in his eyesthat something was seriously troubling him.“I am afraid,” began Tesla, “that you won’t find me a pleasant companiontonight. The fact is, I was almost killed today.”15[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos918345]He had gotten a shock of about 3.5 million volts from one of his machines.“The spark jumped three feet through the air,” he said, “and struck me here onthe right shoulder. I tell you it made me feel dizzy. If my assistant had notturned off the current instantly it might have been the end of me. As it was, Ihave to show for it a queer mark on my right breast where the current struck inand a burned heel in one of my socks where it left my body. Of course the volumeof current was exceedingly small, otherwise it must have been fatal.”16[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos918629]It is possible that he was even minimizing the accident because of Edison’s longcampaign against “deadly AC.”The reporter asked how far sparks could travel.“I have frequently had sparks from my high-tension machines jump the width orlength of my laboratory, say thirty to forty feet,” he said. “Indeed, there isno limit to their lengths, although you can’t see them except for the first yardor so, the flash is so quick…. Yes, I am quite sure I could make a spark a milelong, and I don’t know that it would cost so much either.”Asked whether he had suffered many accidents while working with electricity, hesaid, “Very few. I don’t suppose I average more than one a year, and no one hasever been killed by one of my machines. I always build my machines so thatwhatever happens it cannot kill anyone. The burning of my laboratory two yearsago was the most serious accident I ever had. No one knows what I lost by that.”For a moment he sat reflecting. Then, speaking in the third person, he began toexplain the main source of sadness in a prolific inventor’s life.“So many ideas go chasing through his brain that he can only seize a few of themas they fly, and of these he can only find the time and strength to bring a fewto perfection. And it happens many times that another inventor who has conceivedthe same ideas anticipates him in carrying one out of them. Ah, I tell you, thatmakes a fellow’s heart ache.”When the laboratory burned, he said, there was destroyed with it the apparatushe had devised for liquefying air by a new method. “I was on the eve of success,and in the months of delay that ensued, a German scientist solved the problem….”It was Linde who anticipated him in this important commercial breakthrough ofliquid oxygen. Tesla had been seeking a means of refrigeration for theartificial insulation of electrical mains.“I was so blue and discouraged in those days,” he said, “that I don’t believe Icould have borne up but for the regular electric treatment which I administeredto myself. You see, electricity puts into the tired body just what it mostneeds—life force, nerve force. It’s a great doctor, I can tell you, perhaps thegreatest of all doctors.”Asked if he were often depressed, he said, “Perhaps not often. . . . Every manof artistic temperament has relapsed from the great enthusiasms that buoy him upand sweep him forward. In the main my life is very happy, happier than any lifeI can conceive of.”He described the overmastering excitement of his research. “I do not think thereis any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventoras he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success. . . . Such emotionsmake a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.”It was as if he had purposely led the reporter to the next question. Did hebelieve in marriage “for persons of artistic temperament”?Tesla considered carefully.“For an artist, yes; for a musician, yes; for a writer, yes; but for aninventor, no. The first three must gain inspiration from a woman’s influence andbe led by their love to finer achievement, but an inventor has so intense anature with so much in it of wild, passionate quality, that in giving himself toa woman he might love, he would give everything, and so take everything from hischosen field. I do not think you can name many great inventions that have beenmade by married men.”Whether this struck the interviewer as a sly put-down of Edison, with his twomarriages, he did not indicate.Tesla hesitated and then, adverting to his single estate, added with what thereporter described as pathos, “It’s a pity too, for sometimes we feel solonely.”"},{"pageContent":"11. TO MARS Letters from Katharine betrayed both the mercurial state of her emotions and thesteady state of her interest in Tesla. At this remove of time, it is difficultto know what to make of these curious missives. Effusive and intimate, theysometimes seem to stop just short of becoming love letters, but if Katharine wastending in that direction, Tesla gave her little encouragement.On April 3, 1896, she invited him to their home, commenting that although he hadlooked ill when she had last seen him, yet he had managed to cheer her up, and“now I need to be brought up again.” She mentioned that it was Easter. “I havealways wondered when the great changes are in progress if you know of them,” shewrote. “Do you know when Spring is near? It used to make me so happy and now itbrings me only sorrow. It means so much that I would fain escape . . .disintegration, separation. I wish that I, like you, could go on forever andforever in the same routine, without break, living my own life, as you say youdo. I do not know whose life I live, it has not seemed my own. You must cometomorrow evening, you see.”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos918904]The Johnsons spent a part of that summer in Maine, but separation from theinventor only increased Katharine’s sadness and her concern for his health.“You are making a mistake, my dear friend, almost a fatal one,” she wrote. “Youthink you do not need change and rest. You are so tired you do not know what youneed….”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos919112]In reply to these warm letters, Tesla alternately teased her or sent flowerswhen he thought of it. Perhaps he sensed he might be on treacherous ground.Robert was also his friend, and Robert loved Katharine, and. . . . But at leasthe probably did not have to worry about his own feelings. He had scarcely everknown a moment of vulnerability.With Johnson he exchanged notes on religion, poetry, and whether or not heshould pose for a certain painter of fashionable portraits for the May number ofCentury. A casual effusiveness had entered their correspondence, a “Dear Luka”from Tesla to Johnson saying, “I am glad to know that you still love me….”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos919318]Although he was no orthodox believer, Tesla commended religion as an excellentthing for others. In this period when anxiety over his inventions was stretchedalmost beyond bearing, and his pocketbook was equally thin, he became interestedin Buddhism. It and Christianity, he believed, were to be the most importantreligions of the future. He therefore sent a book on Buddhism to Johnson, whoreplied: “Sir Knight: I did not know you were enlisted on that side of thecampaign, but now when I read it I shall think of you even more frequently thanusual— which is by no means seldom, let me assure you.”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos919530]Days later when the Johnsons again invited him to dinner, he joked about hisweakness for elegant people: “If you have visitors (ordinary mortals) I will notcome. If you have Paderewski, Roentgen, or Mrs. Anthony—I will come. Pleaseanswer.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos919736]Christmas of that year was not a happy occasion for Katharine, despite orperhaps because of the usual efforts at family gaiety. She felt trapped.Although her children and husband were dear to her and she usually enjoyed thesocial round, a vital part of her life seemed missing. Was it worth living onlyfor the slow disintegration she felt?The day following Christmas she wrote to Tesla:“I have tried several times to thank you for the roses. They are before me as Iwrite—so strong, so superb in color. . . . I must always when I write to youmake several attempts, a system of repression because I can never express what Iwould say. I did not mean to be severe the other evening. I was only wrapped upin disappointment. I miss you very much and wonder if it is always to go on thisway and if I can ever become accustomed to not seeing you. However I am glad toknow that you are well and happy and prosperous. With every kind wish for theNew Year my dear friend.”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos919946]Typically, when Tesla got around to responding, he tried to lighten the moodwith chiding. He only succeeded in being cruel, going on about how he had foundher sister, whom he had recently met, much more pretty and charming than she.Then he went back to work.After the lectures of 1893 in which he had described in detail the six basicrequirements of radio transmission and reception, he had built equipment thatcould be operated between his laboratory and various points within New YorkCity. The fire had destroyed all this and had set back his research, but by thespring of 1897, with financial help from Adams and strong support fromWestinghouse, he was prepared to move ahead.He announced to the Electrical Review in August, before filing his basic radiopatents, that successful tests had been made, but the report was guarded andgeneral: “Already he has constructed both a transmitting apparatus and anelectrical receiver which at distant points is sensitive to the signals of thetransmitter, regardless of earth currents or points of the compass. And this hasbeen done with a surprisingly small expenditure of energy.”By disturbing the “electrostatic equilibrium” at any point on the Earth, theReview explained, the disturbance could be distinguished at a distant point andthus “the means of signalling and reading signals becomes practicable once theconcrete instruments are available.” By actual testing, said the report, he “hasreally accomplished wireless communication over reasonably long distances . . .and has only to perfect apparatus to go to any extent….”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos920146]Tesla made tests from a boat chugging up the Hudson River, carrying thereceiving set twenty-five miles from his new laboratory on Houston Street. Andthis was only a fraction of what his instruments were capable of doing.He filed his basic patent applications No. 645,576 and 649,621 on September 2,1897, and they were granted in 1900. Later, as we have noted, they would becontested in long litigation by Marconi; but first Tesla would sue the Italianfor infringement.8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos920360]In 1898 he filed and was granted patent No. 613,809 which described radio remotecontrol for use in guided vehicles. Here was yet another potentially spectacularapplication of wireless transmission. He could scarcely wait to show the publicnot just radio or the first breakthrough in automation, but both at once.The year before when speaking at Buffalo on the occasion of introducing NiagaraFalls power, GE having just completed its lines, Tesla had declared that he nowhoped to see the fulfillment of his fondest dream, “namely, the transmission ofpower from station to station without the employment of any connecting wire. . ..”9 [../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos920515] Thevisiting dignitaries—engineers, industrialists, financiers—had listened withmixed emotions. This gifted madman seemed bent on making whole systems obsoleteas soon as they came into being, and just when they promised to start earningprofits. But soon newspapers around the world were announcing that he haddeveloped equipment that not only would transmit energy and intelligence throughthe Earth for a distance of twenty miles, but that he also could send itwirelessly through the air.10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos920734]And so certain was Tesla that he now claimed that communication with Mars wouldbe possible in a short time.An announcement was carried by the Electrical Review describing how Mr. Teslahad invented apparatus “capable of generating electrical pressures vastly inexcess of any heretofore used,” with which the current “can be conducted to aterminal maintained at an elevation where the rarefied atmosphere is capable ofconducting freely the particular current produced. At a distant point where theenergy is to be used commercially a second terminal is maintained at about thesame elevation to attract and receive the current, and to convey it to earththrough special means for transforming and utilizing it.”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos920972]The article was illustrated with streamers representing electrical pressure of2.5 million volts pouring from a single coil. Other publications showed hugestationary balloons being used to maintain the terminals at required elevations.“Tesla now proposes,” the Electrical Review continued, “to transmit without theuse of any wires through the natural media—the earth and the air—great amountsof power to distances of thousands of miles. This will appear a dream, a talefrom the ‘Arabian Nights.’ But the extraordinary discoveries Tesla has madeduring a number of years of incessant labor . . . make it evident that his workin this field has passed the stage of laboratory experiment, and is ready for apractical test on an industrial scale. The success of his efforts means thatpower from such sources as Niagara will become available in any part of theworld regardless of distance.”12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos921201]Some of the articles appearing at this time reported the goal as a faitaccompli, carrying such headlines as, “Tesla Electrifies the Whole Earth.”Michael Pupin read Tesla’s claim about being able to communicate with Mars anduttered a mute appeal to the patron saint of transplanted Serbs. Along withother scientific colleagues, he wondered, What next? Long ago as a boy herdingcattle along the military frontier of Serbia, he had learned about theimportance of the Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance. He and the otherboys had stuck their knives into the earth at night, falling asleep with theirears against the blades. The merest sound of moving cattle or of maraudingRomanians stealing through the cornstalks would quickly awaken them.Later Pupin realized that an oscillator sending out electrical waves wouldpenetrate longer distances when one of its sides was connected to the Earth. Butto speak of sending wireless signals to Mars seemed palpable nonsense, “becausethere would not be the acoustical resonance of earth to cover great distances.”Such minor considerations did not deter Tesla, however, as he built equipmentthat exceeded anything ever designed before. He built many shapes, sizes, andvarieties of Tesla coils, or high-frequency transformers, including aflat-spiral resonant transformer that represented a beautiful evolution indesign and with which he could produce electromotive forces of many millions ofvolts.One of the major problems associated with very high-voltage apparatus is theloss due to corona and other spurious discharges, which severely “drag down” theoutput and ultimately limit maximum capability. To these problems Teslasucceeded in evolving elegant solutions.He considered the ultimate design to be a transformer having a secondary inwhich the parts, charged to a high potential, were of considerable area andarranged in space along ideal enveloping surfaces of very large radii ofcurvature, and at proper distances from one another, thereby insuring a smallelectric surface density everywhere. Thus no leak could occur even if theconductor were bare. This design was exemplified in his flat-spiral coil.In his laboratory he had installed a two-turn primary circuit running all aroundthe large room and it was this coil, plus the associated circuit interrupters,that he would later ship to Colorado to drive his magnifying transmitter. Theprimary was buried in the ground, and it probably had such specialcharacteristics as a very large diameter and multistrands.With such equipment, he felt, there were no limits: a message could be sent toMars almost as easily as to Chicago. “I found that there was practically nolimit to the tension available,” he wrote in the Electrical Review, and “Idiscovered the most important of all facts arrived at in the course of myinvestigation in these fields. One of these was that the atmospheric air, thoughordinarily a perfect insulator, conducted freely the currents of immenseelectro-motive force producible by such coils…. So great is the conductivity ofthe air, that the discharge issuing from a single terminal behaves as if theatmosphere were rarefied. Another fact is that this conductivity increases veryrapidly with the rarefaction of the atmosphere and augmentation of theelectrical pressures, to such an extent that at barometric pressures whichpermit of no transit of ordinary currents, those generated by such a coil passwith great freedom through the air as through a copper wire.”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos921367]He had proved conclusively, he said, that great amounts of electrical energycould be transmitted through the upper air strata to almost any distance. And helearned what he considered an equally important fact: that the discharges of anelectromotive force of a few million volts excited powerful affinities in theatmospheric nitrogen, causing it to combine with oxygen and other elements. “Soenergetic are these actions and so strangely do such powerful dischargesbehave,” he said, “that I have often experienced a fear that the atmospheremight be ignited, a terrible possibility, which Sir William Crookes, with hispiercing intellect, has already considered. Who knows but such a calamity ispossible?”Electrical resonance was not Tesla’s original idea, for Lord Kelvin hadintroduced the mathematical potential of the condenser discharge; but Teslaexhumed the equation and gave it vibrant life.In the 1899 Electrical Review article in which Tesla expressed fear of settingfire to the sky, several startling photographs appeared of the inventor workingwith the apparatus he had been building.14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos921540] Onerecords a spectacular display of lightning achieved with pressure of about eightmillion volts in an experiment for transmitting electrical energy greatdistances without wires. Another shows the inventor holding a disconnected,brilliantly lighted vacuum bulb of 1,500 candlepower, the light being used forthe photograph. The frequency is measured in millions per second.A third shows Tesla in brilliant relief, with a coil energized by the waves of adistant oscillator and adjusted to the capacity of his own body, which ispreserved from injury “by maintaining a position at the nodal point, where theintense vibration is little felt.” The pressure on the end of the coil, which isilluminated by powerful streamers, is nearly half a million volts.A final photograph in this eerily remarkable series bears the caption: “In thisexperiment the operator’s body is charged to a great pressure by a directconnection with an oscillator. The photograph shows a conducting bar, carryingon the end a sheet of tin of determined size, held in hand. The operator is onthe top of a stationary electrical wave and the bar and sheet are bothilluminated by the violently agitated air surrounding them. One of the vacuumtubes used in lighting the laboratory, though at considerable distance on theceiling, glows brightly, being affected by the vibrations transmitted to it fromthe operator’s body.”Tesla delighted in such magic, but for critics who might think him moreinterested in effects than utility, he added that there were to be mundanerewards as well. With the tools of electrical resonance and circuits in exactsynchronism, he said, nitrogen could be extracted from the air and valuablefertilizer manufactured. Also light, “diffusive like that of the sun,” could beproduced with an economy greater than that obtainable in the usual ways and withlamps that never burned out.His dreams were Utopian: Earth delivered from hunger and toil; easy worldcommunication; control of weather; a bountiful supply of energy; limitlesslight; and last but not least, a link with the forms of life he was convincedexisted on other planets. Martians he regarded as a “statistical certainty.”Meanwhile, for his friends of a more pedestrian nature, life continued as usual.Katharine sent him a poignant and critical letter, inviting him to yet anotherparty and reminding him that he was neglecting his friends. The Johnson childrenwere growing up, and she could foresee a day when even they would have no needof her. Time raced, and she was suffering from intimations of mortality: “Doleave aside the millionaires, high-sounding titles, the Waldorf and FifthAvenue…,” she wrote, “for some simple everyday people who are distinguished onlyby a great weakness….“I have heard lots of things about you—I am sure some of them you don’t know ofyourself, and I am just dying to tell them all to you, but of course you wouldnot care to hear them. Do you know that I am going abroad in the Spring, theearly Spring, and who knows, perhaps these familiar scenes may know me no more.So if you have not forgotten me entirely, or forgotten to be fond of me—I haveforgotten to forget. You had better come now and again.“‘O how fast the days are flitting.’ There are so few days left in my years, nowit is Autumn and we are returning from exile, and then it is Spring and we aretaking it up again, the interminable summer begins, there is no winter. Behuman, be kind and come. You know it is Robert’s party. Perhaps you will comefor him.”15[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos921668]He emerged from his laboratory and went to the party. For a time he tried to bemore thoughtful. In a note to the “Palais Johnson” he mentioned Luka’s “greattranslations of Serbian poetry,” and said he had sent three copies of his bookto “three queens—American queens, I might add.” He invited the Johnsons to acelebration at the Waldorf—“before I run out of money.” And he sent a frivolousnote to “Mrs. Johnston, the Belle of the Ball,” of which, many years later,Agnes Johnson Holden was to write on the envelope: “Joke played on mother by Mr.Tesla, disguising handwriting and misspelling her name.”With partying resumed it was for a while almost like old times. But soon theseduction of the laboratory claimed him again. Tesla for a long time had beenexploring the area of mechanical vibrations—as for example with the platform onwhich he had allowed Mark Twain to experiment for fun and health. Almost at oncehe had begun to produce unexpected effects.One day in 1898 while testing a tiny electromechanical oscillator, he attachedit with innocent intent to an iron pillar that went down through the center ofhis loft building at 46 East Houston Street, to the sandy floor of the basement.Flipping on the switch, he settled into a straight-backed chair to watch andmake notes of everything that happened. Such machines always fascinated himbecause, as the tempo built higher and higher, they would establish resonancewith first one object in his workshop and then another. For example, a piece ofequipment or furniture would suddenly begin to shimmy and dance. As he steppedup the frequency, it would halt but another more in tune would take up thefrantic jig and, later on, yet another.What Tesla was unaware of on this occasion was that vibrations from theoscillator, traveling down the iron pillar with escalating force, were beingcarried through the substructure of Manhattan in all directions. (Normallyearthquakes are more severe at a distance from their epicenter.) Buildings beganto shake, windows shattered, and citizens poured onto the streets in the nearbyItalian and Chinese neighborhoods.At Police Headquarters on Mulberry Street, where Tesla was already regarded withsuspicion, it soon became apparent that no other part of the city was having anearthquake. Two officers were dispatched posthaste to check on the mad inventor.The latter, unaware of the shambles occurring all around his building, had justbegun to sense an ominous vibration in the floor and walls. Knowing that he mustquickly put a stop to it, he seized a sledgehammer and smashed the littleoscillator in a single blow.With perfect timing the two policemen rushed through the door, allowing him toturn with a courteous nod.“Gentlemen, I am sorry,” he said. “You are just a trifle too late to witness myexperiment. I found it necessary to stop it suddenly and unexpectedly and in anunusual way. . . . However, if you will come around this evening I will haveanother oscillator attached to this platform and each of you can stand on it.You will, I am sure, find it a most interesting and pleasurable experience. Nowyou must leave, for I have many things to do. Good day, gentlemen.”16[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos921868]When reporters arrived, he blandly told them that he could destroy the BrooklynBridge in a matter of minutes if he felt like it.Years later he told Allan L. Benson of other experiments he had made with anoscillator no larger than an alarm clock. He described attaching the vibrator toa steel link two feet long and two inches thick. “For a long time nothinghappened…. But at last… the great steel link began to tremble, increased itstrembling until it dilated and contracted like a beating heart—and finallybroke!”17[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos922040]Sledgehammers could not have done it, he told the reporter; crow-bars could nothave done it, but a fusillade of taps, no one of which would have harmed a baby,did it.Pleased with this beginning, he put the little vibrator in his coat pocket andwent out to hunt a half-built steel building. Finding one in the Wall Streetdistrict, ten stories high, with nothing up but the steelwork, he clamped thevibrator to one of the beams.“In a few minutes,” he told the reporter, “I could feel the beam trembling.Gradually the trembling increased in intensity and extended throughout the wholegreat mass of steel. Finally, the structure began to creak and weave, and thesteelworkers came to the ground panic-stricken, believing that there had been anearthquake. Rumors spread that the building was about to fall, and the policereserves were called out. Before anything serious happened, I took off thevibrator, put it in my pocket, and went away. But if I had kept on ten minutesmore, I could have laid that building flat in the street. And, with the samevibrator, I could drop Brooklyn Bridge in less than an hour.”Nor was this all. He boasted to Benson that he could split the Earth in the sameway—“split it as a boy would split an apple—and forever end the career of man.”Earth’s vibrations, he went on, have a periodicity of about one hour andforty-nine minutes. “That is to say, if I strike the earth this instant, a waveof contraction goes through it that will come back in one hour and forty-nineminutes in the form of expansion. As a matter of fact, the earth, likeeverything else, is in a constant state of vibration. It is constantlycontracting and expanding.“Now, suppose that at the precise moment when it begins to contract, I explode aton of dynamite. That accelerates the contraction and, in one hour andforty-nine minutes, there comes an equally accelerated wave of expansion. Whenthe wave of expansion ebbs, suppose I explode another ton of dynamite, thusfurther increasing the wave of contraction. And, suppose this performance berepeated, time after time. Is there any doubt as to what would happen? There isno doubt in my mind. The earth would be split in two. For the first time inman’s history, he has the knowledge with which he may interfere with cosmicprocesses!”When Benson asked how long it might take him to split the Earth, he answeredmodestly, “Months might be required; perhaps a year or two.” But in only a fewweeks, he said, he could set the Earth’s crust into such a state of vibrationthat it would rise and fall hundreds of feet, throwing rivers out of their beds,wrecking buildings, and practically destroying civilization. To the relief ofordinary citizens, Tesla later qualified his claim. The principle could notfail, he said, but it would be impossible to obtain perfect mechanical resonanceof the Earth.As usual, Tesla’s comments to the press smack of exhibitionism. But also, asusual, his research was fundamentally sound. He had begun to establish a newscience that he called “telegeodynamics,” and it was to have important results.He saw that the same principles of vibration could be used to detect remoteobjects, such as submarines or ships. By using mechanical vibrations with theknown constant of the Earth, he also hoped to learn how to locate ore depositsand oil fields. Modern subsurface exploratory techniques were thus presaged.Tesla agreed with a theory suggested by O’Neill that a battery of gyroscopes,mounted in a region of severe earthquake hazard, could transmit thrusts into theEarth at equally timed intervals, building up resonance in weak strata andreleasing the plate pressure before serious quakes could occur. Today there isrenewed interest by seismologists in such techniques.He described (and later tried to interest Westinghouse in developing) a machineembodying the art of telegeodynamics, with which he claimed to have sent sixmiles through the Earth mechanical waves “of much smaller amplitude thanearthquake waves,” that lost little of their power with distance. They were notintended to transmit electrical energy but would enable messages to be carriedanywhere in the world and received on a tiny pocket set. Such waves could travelwithout interference from weather. When pressed by reporters to describe hisapparatus, he would say only that it was a cylinder of finest steel—suspended inmidair by a type of energy which was old in principle but which had beenamplified by a secret principle—combined with a stationary part. Powerfulimpulses impressed upon the floating cylinder would react on the stationary partand through it, on the Earth.Nothing was to be developed from this concept. All his life, however, Teslastuck by his guns as to the awesome potential of mechanical resonance and hewent on throwing the fear of God (through science) into impressionable NewYorkers. He could walk over to the Empire State Building, he told reporters,“and reduce it to a tangled mass of wreckage in a very short time.” Themechanism would be a tiny oscillator, “an engine so small you could slip it inyour pocket.” Only 2.5 horsepower would be needed to drive the little vibrator.First, he said, the outer stone coating of the skyscraper would be hurled off.Then the whole vast skeleton of steel, the pride and glory of the Manhattanskyline, would collapse. At this point superman would presumably slip the tinymechanism into his pocket and casually saunter away, perhaps reciting a line ortwo from Faust. Then his critics would rue the day.Whatever else Tesla may have been trying to invite by making flamboyantstatements such as these—the adulation of his followers, the wrath of otherscientists, the consternation of officialdom—he was certainly not courtingindifference. But then public indifference was the one thing he could leastafford. The more so since fate seemed constantly to be thrusting him into directcompetition with that master enchanter of the public imagination, the formidableold Wizard of Menlo Park."},{"pageContent":"12. ROBOTS The New Year 1898 found Edison and Tesla in a neck-and-neck race to see whocould boggle the minds of lesser mortals with the more outrageous claims. Newsof their doings had spread all the way to San Francisco, where it was reportedthat Edison now was “credited with announcing that he can photograph thought.Nikola Tesla tells a New York paper that he has ‘harnessed the rays of the sun’and will compel them to operate machinery and give light and heat. Thisinvention is still in the experimental stage, but he declares that there is nota possibility of its failure. He has discovered a method of producing steam fromthe rays of the sun. The steam runs a steam engine which generateselectricity….”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos922390]Tesla’s solar engine was so simple in design, he said, that if it were fullydescribed others might seize the idea, patent it, and control a blessing “whichhe intends shall be a free gift to the world.” He nevertheless permittedChauncey McGovern of Pearson’s Magazine to see his invention, which he claimedemployed a single secret factor.In the center of a large room with a glass roof—his solar municipalpowerhouse—reposed a huge cylinder of thick glass on a bed of asbestos andstone. Encircling it would be mirrors covered with asbestos coats to refract therays of the sun into the glass cylinder.2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos922575] Thecylinder would always be kept full of water, which would have been treated by asecret chemical process, and which he said was the only complicated part of thesystem.All day long while the sun shone, with the chemical treatment making the watereasily subject to heat, steam would be produced to run ordinary steam engines.These in turn would generate electricity for home and factory—enough, indeed, tosupply a surplus, to be stored for cloudy days.The inventor said he fully expected to be ridiculed for having devised a systemso simple. The cost of generating such energy would be minimal and hebelieved—contrary to the experience of subsequent generations—that it should beeasy to perfect batteries that could store a whole year’s supply of electricityagainst possible accidents in the generating machinery. The system, he declared,would be a “great deal less artificial than for men to delve down into thebowels of the earth at so much trouble and loss of life in order to get a fewhandfuls of coal to run an engine a short time and then to make spasmodic returntrips for more.” Indeed, he hoped to see his solar engine replace not only coal,but wood and every other source of motive power, heat, and light.Getting his inventions into working form was becoming an ever more seriousproblem for Tesla, laboring as he did almost alone and besieged with anincessant distracting flight of new ideas. So far as is known, his solar systemwas never used commercially. And he was having the same trouble with his newvacuum-tube photography lights.To Robert Johnson he wrote: “I feel confident I have a light which forphotography will be better than sunlight, but I have no spare time to bring itto perfection. . . .” He had recently taken a number of photos of the actorJoseph Jefferson to “vindicate” this mysterious new light. (Five years earlierhe had taken, with Jefferson as model, the first photographs ever made withphosphorescent light.3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos922736]) NowThe New York Times reported, “The art of photography will hereafter beindependent of sunlight and will be relieved of the inconvenience and discomfortof the flashlight if Nikola Tesla’s claims for his latest development of thevacuum tubes are well founded.”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos923030] TheElectrical Review declared it the oddest and most unlooked-for development ofthe vacuum tube.5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos923207]Photographsmade with the tube were widely printed in newspapers. But thereafter little washeard about it.Other kinds of practical inventions also intruded on his mind, warring with hispreference for basic research. He received an urgent request from GeorgeWestinghouse that he provide a “simple and economical device for convertingalternating to continuous (DC) currents. . . .” The Pittsburgh industrialist wasinterested in converting current for, among other things, running electrictrains. Tesla replied at once that he had given a lot of thought to the problemand had “not one but a number of devices to put on your circuit and for all ofthem there is a great demand.”He was convinced, and so announced, that with properly built railroad tracks,trains running on AC/DC could safely travel up to two hundred miles per hour. Asusual his claim gripped the popular imagination even as it griped his fellowinventors. Westinghouse leased one of Tesla’s converters. At around this time healso lent the inventor $6,000 to underwrite other inventions in various stagesof development. Although Tesla had little money at this point, he at least hadno debts.In May Prince Albert of the Belgians visited the United States and includedTesla’s laboratory on his tour. The experience “astonished” him, he said, addingthat the inventor was among those Americans who made the strongest impression onhim.Tesla, never one to underestimate the usefulness of royalty, wired GeorgeWestinghouse and suggested he invite the Prince to be a guest in his Pittsburghhome. Westinghouse thought it an excellent idea and did so. Afterward PrinceAlbert visited the Westinghouse power plant at Niagara Falls, attended by hisroyal entourage.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_056.html#filepos1163861]Meanwhile, publisher William Randolph Hearst was adroitly steering the nationtoward war with Spain; and a strange concurrence of events was shaping thatwould cause a Teslian moment of glory to be stolen by one of the inventor’sclosest friends.Hearst’s man in Havana, Frederick Remington, wired his boss: “Everything isquiet. There is no trouble here. There will be no war. I wish to return.” Towhich the great man replied: “Please remain. You furnish the pictures, and I’llfurnish the war.”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos923382]Hearst saw real battles as a solution to the circulation war then raging betweenhis New York Journal and Pulitzer’s New York World. His opening journalisticvolleys were aimed at Spain for alleged cruelty to “the gentle Cuban people.”When the battleship Maine mysteriously exploded and sank in Havana harbor, heneeded nothing more as an excuse to lash the country into a mood for vengeance.The U.S. Congress, yielding to the clamor of the press, by a narrow votedeclared war upon Spain.7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos923592]Americans, fed by the jingoistic press with daily lies and contrivedcrises—which included warnings of imminent invasion by the Spanish navy ofcities along the eastern seaboard—responded with righteous hysteria.Spain had not the least desire to take on the United States in a fight she couldnot possibly win. Nevertheless the American defense machine was rolled intoaction; harbors were fortified to repel the imagined invader and the fightingforces rallied to the flag.Chauncy Depew, former Secretary of State for New York, gave it as his opinionthat America would never have declared war against Spain had the matter beenleft to President McKinley, rather than to a Congress responsive to the people’smood. And British ambassador James Bryce, horrified by such irrationalpreparations and by the lies he read in the newspapers, said he hoped thecountry’s attitude would not leave a permanent streak of bullying and jingoismin the national character. To this The New York Times retorted loftily thatinterceding on behalf of “oppressed womanhood” could scarcely be interpreted asbullying jingoism. This was a reference to Hearst’s romantic crusade to chargeto the rescue of a Cuban rebel known to his American readers only as MissCisneros.With patriotism pounding in the veins of every loyal son, gestures of a heroicdimension began to be made even by millionaires. Hearst, for example, sent aletter to the President of the United States: “Sir: I beg to offer to the UnitedStates, as a gift, without any conditions whatsoever, my steam yacht Buccaneer.”In his same “no strings” letter, the publisher requested that he be given aposition in command on his boat. The Navy prudently accepted the craft butdeclined the skipper. J. Pierpont Morgan rather more thoughtfully offered tosell his yacht, Corsair, to the government.One spring evening in the midst of this national furor, Tesla and the Johnsons,accompanied by their daughter Agnes and handsome naval Lieutenant RichmondPearson Hobson, dined at the Waldorf-Astoria. It was the Johnson daughter’sdebut into adult society and a last little fling for Lieutenant Hobson before hebade good-bye to Tesla in his laboratory and vanished on a secret Navyassignment. Almost at once a reporter from the Philadelphia Press, as the cardin his hatband announced, appeared at the laboratory door.“I hear you have a wireless device that will communicate with warships onehundred miles away, Dr. Tesla,” he said.“That is true,” said the inventor. “But I cannot give you the details. Onereason I cannot tell you just what my machine is, is that if it can be used onour ships it will give us an advantage; and I shall be proud to have been of somuch use to my country.”“Then you consider yourself a good American?” probed the reporter.“I, a good American? I was a good American before I ever saw this country. I hadstudied its government; I had met some of its people, I admired America. I wasat heart an American before I thought of coming here to live.”As the reporter scribbled, Tesla expanded.“What opportunities this country offers a man! Its people are a thousand yearsahead of the people of any other nation of the world. They are big, broadminded,generous. I could not have accomplished in any other country what I have here.”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos923719]He meant it. It was all true. Forgotten were the times when he had been cheatedby Edison and his managers and other businessmen, when leading Americanscientists had derided his polyphase system, when they had laughed at hispredictions. That was the way it went sometimes. But it was also true that hewas hoping, after an impending exhibition at Madison Square Garden, to interestthe government in his very latest wonders.“The American people are quick to hold out a helping hand and give recognition,”he continued. “Yes, I am as good an American as there is. I have nothing to sellthe government of the U.S. If it needs my services in any way it is welcome tothem.”9 [../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos923882]It was not on the whole, however, a comfortable time for a man of darkcomplexion and foreign accent to be an American. Hometown “spy-hunts” were justthen a popular diversion. Police tended to look the other way if they saw aluckless Spanish-American citizen being beaten up in an alley. Sometimes the“spies” were taken in and grilled for possible deportation.Andrew Carnegie reflected a popular yearning when he predicted, “Ere long weshall have a solid English-speaking race, capable of preventing much of the evilof the world.”Teddy Roosevelt impetuously resigned as assistant secretary of the Navy andbegan recruiting Rough Riders from among the membership list of theKnickerbocker Club. Colonel John Jacob Astor mustered an artillery battery.Cowboys and Sioux Indians rallied to the flag. Meanwhile, riots were reported inSpain and starvation in Cuba. In the end, six times as many U.S. troops woulddie in Cuba of cholera and typhoid as of Spanish bullets.The day for which Tesla the inventor had been working and waiting arrived in themidst of martial distractions. The first Electrical Exhibition at Madison SquareGarden was late in opening, the railroads having been preempted for the movementof soldiers and military supplies and some of the exhibits therefore havingfailed to arrive on time. Overshadowed by larger events, the show was almostsqueezed out of the newspapers. And to cap it all, the weather was rainy. Evenso, fifteen thousand persons showed up.The demonstration of the world’s first radio-controlled robot boat by Teslafailed to make the splash it deserved, not only because it was overshadowed bythe war, but because he made the mistake of presenting more than the publiccould absorb at once. The remarkable stage of development to which he hadcarried wireless, the forerunner of modern radio, would have been quite enough;but to introduce automation simultaneously, as he did, was probably too great aleap. On that day in 1898 when he demonstrated the common ancestor of modernguided weapons and vehicles, of automated industry, and of robotry, he wasintroducing an idea for which the world would not be ready for many years.His first two radio-controlled devices were boats, and one was submersible byremote control. On this initial occasion he showed only the submersible.Commander E. J. Quinby (USN Ret.) who, during World War II, was in charge ofelectronic weapons research for the Navy at Key West, Florida, has written ofvisiting Tesla’s historic exhibit when he was a child: “I was there with myfather, quite fascinated, but also quite unaware that I was witnessing the dawnof space navigation to be realized later, in the following century. Tesla wasnot using Morse code. He was not transmitting messages in any known language.Nevertheless, he was employing his own coded pulses via Hertzian waves todirectly control this pioneer unmanned craft. He encoded the visitors’ commands,and the vessel’s receiver decoded them automatically into actuatingoperations.10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos924009]The full potential of the invention was concealed, in part because Tesla hopedthe Navy would seriously consider using it in the war.“One of the features not revealed,” science writer Kenneth M. Swezey laterdisclosed, “was a system to prevent interference by means of coordinated tuningdevices responsive only to a combination of several radio waves of completelydifferent frequencies. Another was a loop antenna which could be completelyenclosed by the copper hull of the vessel; the antenna would thus be invisibleand the vessel could operate completely submerged.”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos924305]The inventor did not disclose more than his fundamental idea in his basic patentNo. 613,809—a means he had learned to use to protect his discoveries.What his patents included, but the Madison Square Garden viewers did not see,were specifications for a torpedo boat without a crew, including a motor with astorage battery to drive the propeller, smaller motors and batteries to operatethe steering gear, and still others to feed electric signal lights and to raiseor lower the boat in the water.12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos924482] Six14-foot torpedoes were to be placed vertically in two rows so that when one wasdischarged another would fall into place. Tesla had advised the Navy that hethought such a boat could be built for around $50,000.He claimed that a few such craft “could attack and destroy a wholearmada—destroy it utterly in an hour, and the enemy never have a sight of theirantagonists or know what power destroyed them.”When word of this got out he received from Mark Twain, then in Austria, a letterin which the humorist wrote: “Have you Austrian and English patents on thatdestructive terror which you have been inventing? and if so, won’t you set aprice upon them and concession me to sell them? I know Cabinet ministers of bothcountries—and of Germany too; likewise, William II.“I shall be in Europe a year yet.“Here in the hotel the other night when some interested men were discussingmeans to persuade the nations to join with the Czar and disarm, I advised themto seek something more . . . than disarmament by perishable paper. . . . Invitethe great inventors to contrive something against which fleets and armies wouldbe helpless, and thus make war thenceforth impossible. I did not suspect thatyou were already attending to that, and getting ready to introduce into theearth permanent peace and disarmament in a practical and mandatory way.“I know you are a very busy man but will you steal time to drop me a line?”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos924650]But the concept was too advanced and those in charge of American defensedeclared it an impossible dream. Even officials who had observed the midgetnaval maneuvers in the tank proclaimed it a mere “laboratory experiment” thatcould never be extended to actual battle conditions.Tesla’s Madison Square Garden demonstration undoubtedly was the most propheticevent at the show, but other inventors also provided displays to bemuse thepublic. Marconi, without acknowledgment, used a Tesla oscillator to demonstratehow mines could be blown up by firing a “Cuban dynamite gun” with Marconi’sWireless Telegraphy. And Edison demonstrated what would become his folly, theMagnetic Ore Separator.Pupin, president of the New York Electrical Society, Edison, and Marconi, apowerful and brainy trio, were now joined by their faith in the financialpossibilities of commercial wireless and by three ambitions as great as Tesla’sown. One other thing they shared was a growing resentment of Tesla’s success.Tesla and Johnson followed the news of wartime maneuvers and naval encountersfrom day to day in hope of learning something of the mysterious mission of theirfriend Hobson. Nothing had been heard directly from him since his abruptdeparture in early May.In the first part of June Spanish Admiral Cervera, whose whereabouts had beenthe subject of wild speculation in the American press, slipped his vessels intoSantiago harbor for coal. An American fleet of superior size moved in. And onthe flagship New York, unknown to his family and friends at home, was LieutenantHobson. He had been thoroughly trained in gunnery and in the handling ofexplosives.A desperate scheme, almost a suicide mission, was hatched to bottle up Cervera’sfleet. The idea was to sink a ship across the narrowest part of the harbormouth. The old collier Merrimac was chosen and fitted with torpedoes to blow herown hull out. Lieutenant Hobson, at twenty-eight, was chosen to head the missionwith a crew of six volunteers.At 1:30 A.M. on a night of shadowed moonlight the lieutenant and his crewbuckled on cork lifebelts over long underdrawers. Armed only with pistols, theymoved the old coaling boat slowly toward the harbor mouth.Hobson reports in a book he later wrote that he said to his gunner’s mate,“Charette, my lad, we’re going to make it tonight. There is no power on earththat can keep us out of the channel.”At the moment of that ill-timed prediction, a Spanish searchlight picked themout, and the Spanish opened fire. A shell hit their pilot house. Hobson tried totouch off the torpedoes. Only two of them responded, the others having beendefectively wired. In short order Spanish fire reduced the Merrimac to a sinkingwreck—but in a position that failed to block the narrows.Hobson and his men in their early-day frogmen suits, leaped into the sea andswam to a catamaran that had floated from their deck. But just as they wereclambering aboard, a Spanish launch manned by armed soldiers pulled alongside.Hobson records that as he stared up into their guns he thought, “Despicablecowards! Do they mean to shoot us down in cold blood? If they do, a brave nationwill hear of this and call for an account.”It came as something of an anticlimax, therefore, when Admiral Cervera, who washimself on the launch, took the Americans to a Spanish fortress where he treatedthem with great courtesy and soon exchanged them for Spanish prisoners.When this feat of derring-do hit American newspapers, they carried little elsefor days. Hobson was lionized almost to the same degree that Charles Lindberghwould be much later, after flying the Atlantic. Tesla was filled with pride forhis friend and delighted when Hobson was sent home for a round of publicappearances across the country to rally greater enthusiasm for the war. Teslaand Johnson took the young officer to Delmonico’s for a promised celebration andreferred to him frequently as “the hero.”Later it greatly amused the inventor to read of how women swarmed over Hobsonwherever he went. In Chicago the hero spotted two female cousins he knew andkissed them, which touched off the crowd, causing every woman to demand her due.In Denver he was mobbed again and, according to the press, had to kiss fivehundred more. To cap this saccharine frenzy a candy manufacturer announced thathe was bringing out a caramel to be called a “Hobson’s Kiss.”Tesla was sharply reminded of reality by his bookkeeper, George Scherff, whopointed to the fact that money was running out and that his inventions were notbeing completed. There were potentially useful items that people needed, hesaid. For example, doctors and the ailing kept asking for the Tesla Pad—aheat-treating device he had worked on but not perfected for the market.But where was he to find the time to develop such things?He enjoyed a rare flurry of socializing with the Johnsons in the winter of 1898and turned down the usual number of invitations.On November 3, he wrote to “Dear Kate” saying he was glad she had accepted hisinvitation for Saturday and adding: “Though a day of plebeians—drummers,grocerymen, Jews,*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_057.html#filepos1164259] andother social trilobites, the prospect is nevertheless delightful.”14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos924851]In his invitation he added that a month’s income would go on their dinner, buteven so, “do not fear it will be extravagant, for just now there is a temporaryebb in my private fortune . . . but soon I am to be a multi-millionaire and thengood-bye to my friends on Lexington Avenue!”Shortly afterward, invited to dinner by Katharine and asked to suggest apartner, he predictably named Marguerite. “If she would come,” he said, “I knowI would.”On December 3, Hobson arrived back in Manhattan, and another celebration wasplanned. Tesla wrote to Katharine saying, “I am glad. . . . Now we can have thatdinner.” He suggested that “afterwards we could adjourn to the laboratory,” andmentioned a certain lady “who is crazy to see Hobson.” Describing her as a greatcelebrity yet keeping her identity as a surprise, he said he knew how “theFilipovs hunger after such people.” And he added, “I do not want to say anythingdisparaging of a lady, but for my taste she is simply—well, I think you willlook more splendid than ever. I warn you she is apt to come in a scarletdécolleté but is a great artist and she must be permitted the latitude. . . . Iwill sandwich her between Luka and Hobson and wedge you between the hero andmyself….”• • •Tesla’s claims for his first robot vehicles soon came under attack by fellowscientists. Thus “An Inquiry About Tesla’s Electrically Controlled Vessel,” byN. G. Worth, appeared in the Electrical Review, the author expressing hisopinion that the method of control could be counter-influenced by the enemy.15[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos925064]Tesla wrote to Johnson at Century urging him to make no response on his behalf:“I know that you are a noble fellow and devoted friend and, noting yourindignation at these uncalled-for attacks, I am afraid that you might give itexpression. I beg you not to do it under any condition, as you would offend me.Let my ‘friends’ do their worst, I like it better so. Let them spring onscientific societies worthless schemes, oppose a cause which is deserving, throwsand into the eyes of those who might see— they will reap their reward in time….“I could easily refute the statements contained therein, merely by referring toexpressions of such men as Lord Kelvin, Sir William Crookes, Lord Rayleigh,Roentgen and others, which bear testimony of the high esteem and appreciation ofmy labors by these men. But I disdain to do so, because the attack was tooundignified to deserve notice….”16[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos925341]Under the heading “Science and Sensationalism,” the journal Public Opinion alsocriticized his work and methods.17[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos925548]Much later, in his brief autobiography, Tesla disclosed that he had begun activework on building remotely controlled devices in 1893, although the concept hadoccurred to him earlier. During the next two or three years he had built severalmechanisms to be actuated from a distance and showed them to laboratoryvisitors, but the destruction of the laboratory by fire had interrupted theseactivities.“In 1896,” he wrote, “… I designed a complete machine capable of a multitude ofoperations, but the consummation of my labors was delayed until 1897. . . . Whenfirst shown in the beginning of 1898, it created a sensation such as no otherinvention of mine has ever produced.”His basic patent was obtained in November, only after the examiner in chief hadcome to New York and witnessed the performance of his vessel, for he had claimedit seemed unbelievable.“I remember that when later I called on an official in Washington, with a viewof offering the invention to the Government,” Tesla wrote, “he burst out inlaughter upon my telling him what I had accomplished. Nobody thought then thatthere was the faintest prospect of perfecting such a device.”18[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos925769]These first robots, he wrote in 1919, he had originally considered crude stepsin the evolution of the art of teleautomatics. As he had conceived it: “The nextlogical improvement was its application to automatic mechanisms beyond thelimits of vision and at a great distance from the center of control, and I haveever since advocated their employment as instruments of warfare in preference toguns…. In an imperfect manner it is practicable, with the existing wirelessplants, to launch an aeroplane, have it follow a certain approximate course, andperform some operation at a distance of many hundreds of miles.”19[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos926017]He recalled that as a student in college he had conceived of a flying machinequite unlike the present ones.“The underlying principle was sound but could not be carried into practice,” hewrote, “for want of a prime-mover of sufficiently great activity. In recentyears I have successfully solved this problem and am now planning aerialmachines devoid of sustaining planes, ailerons, propellers, and other externalattachments, which will be capable of immense speeds and are very likely tofurnish powerful arguments for peace in the near future.”20[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos926184]The futuristic aircraft that he conceived of and illustrated was to be guidedeither mechanically or by wireless energy.“By installing proper plants it will be practicable to project a missile of thiskind into the air and drop it almost on the very spot designated, which may bethousands of miles away. But we are not going to stop at this. Teleautomata willbe ultimately produced, capable of acting as if possessed of their ownintelligence, and their advent will create a revolution.”21[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos926320]As early as 1898 he had also proposed to manufacturers the production of anautomated car which, “left to itself, would perform a great variety ofoperations involving something akin to judgment. But my proposal was deemedchimerical at that time and nothing came from it.”Conceiving of robots as having many uses besides war, he believed their greatestrole would lie in peaceful service to humanity. He later described his 1890sactivity to Professor B. F. Meissner of Purdue University: “I treated the wholefield broadly, not limiting myself to mechanisms controlled from distance but tomachines possessed of their own intelligence. Since that time I had advancedgreatly in the evolution of the invention and think that the time is not distantwhen I shall show an automaton which, left to itself, will act as thoughpossessed of reason and without any wilful control from the outside. Whatever bethe practical possibilities of such an achievement, it will mark the beginningof a new epoch in mechanics.”He added: “I would call your attention to the fact that while my specification,above mentioned, shows the automatic mechanism as controlled through a simpletuned circuit, I have used individualized control; that is, one based on theco-operation of several circuits of different periods of vibration, a principlewhich I had already developed at that time and which was subsequently describedin my patents 723,188 and 723,189*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_058.html#filepos1164587]ofMarch, 1903. The machine was in this form when I made demonstrations with it in1898 before the Chief Examiner (of Patents) Seeley, prior to the grant of mybasic patent on Method of and Apparatus for Controlling Mechanisms at aDistance.”22[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos926456]It was this that Swezey alluded to in his comments on “coordinated tuningdevices responsive only to a combination of several radio waves of completelydifferent frequencies.”Inventors of modern computer technology in the last half of the twentiethcentury repeatedly have been surprised, when seeking patents, to encounterTesla’s basic ones, already on file. Leland Anderson, for example, states thatTesla’s priority was first pointed out to him years ago by a patent attorney fora major computer firm with which he was associated in a research and developmentcapacity. Anderson writes, “I am puzzled by the reluctance of some in thecomputer technology field to acknowledge Tesla’s priority in this regard incontrast to the adulation given to Messrs. Brattain, Bardeen, and Shockley forthe invention of the transistor which made electronic computers a practicalreality.”23[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos926673]Their patents and the Tesla patents were both directed at applications in thecommunications field, he notes. Both patents are combined to produce thephysical embodiment of a solid-state AND gate. Computer systems containthousands of logic decision elements called ANDs and ORs. All operationsperformed by a computer are achieved through a system design utilizing theselogic elements.“Tesla’s 1903 patents 723,188 and 725,605,” says Anderson, “contain the basicprinciples of the logical AND circuit element. The simultaneous occurrence oftwo or more prescribed signals at the input to the device element produced anoutput from the device element.”Although Tesla’s patents used AC signals and today’s computers use pulsed DC,the basic principle of a prescribed combination of signals producing an outputby virtue of their conjoint action is described.“Thus,” declares Anderson, “the subject early Tesla patents, which were designedto achieve interference protection from outside influences in the command ofradio-controlled weapons, have proved to be an obstacle for anyone attempting toobtain a basic logical AND circuit element patent in this era of modern computertechnology.”24[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos926850]The Nobel Prize was awarded to John Bardeen, Walter H. Brattain, and William B.Shockley in 1956 for their work on developing the transistor, which replacedelectronic tubes in many applications. Yet Tesla has only recently been so muchas recognized for having pioneered the field.One of the earliest acknowledgments of the debt owed Tesla in the new technologyof remotely piloted vehicles (now universally known in the military as RPVs)appeared in a 1944 Times editorial:“The general principle of controlling apparatus by radio goes back to the earlydays of what was once called ‘wireless.’ At the first electrical exposition heldin this city over forty years ago Nikola Tesla maneuvered and blew up a modelsubmarine in a tank by radio. There soon followed a score of German, American,English, and French inventors who showed how engine-driven vehicles, torpedoesand ships could be steered by radio waves with never a man on board….”25[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos926978]Yet Tesla, having done so much to introduce the era of automation, felt that hehad no time just then to pursue a line of development for which the world wasstill manifestly unready. His sights were fixed on bigger game—if that werepossible. His laboratory in New York was no longer a safe place for hisexperiments; or, rather, his experiments had become too dangerous for a crowdedcity.To Leonard Curtis, a patent attorney who had loyally protected his andWestinghouse’s rights during the War of the Currents, he wrote: “My coils areproducing 4,000,000 volts—sparks jumping from walls to ceilings are a firehazard. This is a secret test. I must have electrical power, water and my ownlaboratory. I will need a good carpenter who will follow instructions. I ambeing financed for this by Astor, and also Crawford and Simpson. My work will bedone late at night when the power load will be least.”26[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos927154]Curtis, who was associated with the Colorado Springs Electric Company,immediately set to work on the inventor’s problem. His solution would havefar-reaching consequences."},{"pageContent":"13. HURLER OF LIGHTNING Leonard Curtis’s reply from Colorado Springs could not have brought better news:“All things arranged, land will be free. You will live at the Alta Vista Hotel.I have interest in the City Power Plant so electricity is free to you.”Tesla, overjoyed, threw himself into detailed preparations, especially theordering of machinery that would have to be shipped. Meanwhile, Scherff and hisshop assistant, Kolman Czito, were called upon to labor almost around the clockfor a major move of laboratory equipment.Of paramount importance was the reorganizing of his finances. The $40,000 paidto him by Adams for stock in the Nikola Tesla Company had long since been spent.Ten thousand dollars given to him by John Hays Hammond, Sr., the famous miningengineer, had gone to underwrite his wireless and robot work for the ElectricalExhibition. But the drygoods firm of Simpson and Crawford lent another $10,000to him for ongoing research, and Col. John Jacob Astor, owner of theWaldorf-Astoria Hotel, contributed $30,000 toward the building of the newresearch station in Colorado Springs.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos927474]Once established in Colorado, Tesla intended to devote all his energies towardan immediate dual goal: to develop a worldwide wireless system well ahead of theambitious Marconi, and to learn how to send energy abundantly and cheaplywithout wires to the ends of the Earth. No body of knowledge, except that whichhe had already developed, existed to guide him.Yet there remained a little time to socialize with his friends, a little time torekindle jealousy in the adoring Katharine. Marguerite was the pawn in thisgame, if it was a game.“Agnes will come by all means,” he wrote to Kate, as if she were his socialsecretary. “And—wouldn’t you invite Miss Merington? She is such a wonderfullyclever woman. . . . Really I would like to have her with us….”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos927645]On the twenty-fifth of March he begged off a date with Luka, “having alreadyaccepted an important engagement with an English millionaire.” But he describedhis joy at having at last moved into the fashionable Waldorf-Astoria Hotel afterten years at the “abominable place” that appeared to pride itself more on thequality of being fireproof than on the honor of having a distinguished inventorin residence.3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos927883]Colonel Astor, at least, felt honored to have him as a guest. And Tesla wasinstantly at home in his smart new surroundings, where all the important men ofWall Street gathered in the afternoon.In the flurry before departure he found time to initiate an effort to “getpermission from the French government for transmitting energy and establishingcommunication with France without wires, in view of the coming Exposition. . ..” His reason for this was to be disclosed on his arrival in Colorado.Tesla departed New York on May 11, 1899, traveling by train and making astopover in Chicago to demonstrate again his radio-controlled boat. GeorgeScherff was left behind to run the New York laboratory, with precise and lengthyinstructions for more equipment to be built, bought, and shipped. Of courseTesla left him with neither adequate money nor a power of attorney to cover theday-to-day expenses. As the inventor saw the matter, when he considered it atall, his staff would soon share in his own wealth and fame.Arriving at Colorado Springs on May 18, he was taken directly to the Alta VistaHotel. After examining the creaky elevator, he chose room No. 207 (divisible bythree and only one flight up), and left instructions for the maid to delivereighteen clean towels daily. He said he preferred to do his own dusting.The land made available to him was about a mile east of Colorado Springs, in theshadow of Pike’s Peak. Its main use was grazing pasture for the town’s dairyherd. His closest neighbor was to be the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind,a choice reflecting some discretion. The elevation was 6,000 feet above sealevel; the air clear, dry and crackling with static electricity.To reporters who interviewed him on his arrival, he disclosed that he planned tosend a wireless message from Pike’s Peak to Paris in time for the ParisExposition of 1900. The journalists asked whether he meant to send messages frompeak to peak. He replied haughtily that he had not come to Colorado to engage instunts.He had filed in the preceding decade a whole series of patents related to thewireless transmission of power and messages, beginning with the most basicequipment for the production of high frequencies and high voltages.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_059.html#filepos1164833] He hadalready built a coil that produced 4 million volts, and now he wanted to go muchhigher in order to power a device capable of making transmissions on a globalscale. The tests were to be made in great secrecy—or, at any rate, as muchsecrecy as was possible in a small community titillated by the arrival of afamous inventor with mountains of mysterious equipment.Tesla was directed to a local carpenter named Joseph Dozier, to whom he outlinedplans for the experimental station, and the construction began immediately. Hethen sent the first of an almost continuous stream of wires and letters toScherff in New York asking that Fritz Lowenstein, his young engineeringassistant, be sent west: “He must be here to oversee construction and locateequipment.”During the building of the experiment station the inventor commuted to and fromthe site each day by buckboard, his long legs sprawled over the sides—not somuch from lack of space as in readiness to abandon ship. Tesla trusted horses nomore than he did electric elevators. (In time, the horses of Colorado Springswould have equal reason not to trust Tesla, for when he got his powerfulmagnifying transmitter operating, it would electrify the Earth in alldirections, making runaways of the gentlest nags.)A fence surrounded the weird structure that began to rise from the prairiefloor, and this barrier bristled with warnings: “KEEP OUT— GREAT DANGER.” Whenthe station was completed an even more ominous quotation from Dante’s Infernowas posted at the door: “Abandon hope all ye who enter here.” It did not takelong for the word to spread that the apparatus being built by Mr. Tesla wascapable of killing a hundred persons in a single flash of lightning.The experiment station, which had started out looking like a large square barn,ended up resembling a ship with a towering mast. Extruding from an open sectionof the roof was a tower that reached eighty feet above the ground. From thismetal mast soared another 122 feet into the air. Poised upon its tip was acopper ball three feet in diameter.Machinery was moved in and assembled as quickly as it arrived on theconstruction scene. Coils or high-frequency transformers in many shapes andsizes were built. From New York came the specially built two-turn primarycircuit that he had had in his laboratory on Houston Street. With its associatedcircuit interrupters, it would drive his magnifying transmitter.This transmitter, which he developed in Colorado, he would later claim as hisgreatest invention. Indeed, it is the Tesla invention that continues tofascinate many of his modern followers the most. Whenever and wherever in recentyears phenomena have been detected, resulting from powerful radio signals pulsedat very low frequencies, journalists speak knowingly of the Tesla effect. TheRussians, it has been claimed, are using a giant Tesla magnifying transmitter tomodify the world’s weather, creating extremes of ice and drought. It is said tocause periodic disruption of radio communications in Canada and the UnitedStates with attendant brain-wave interference and vague symptoms of physicaldistress, not to mention sonic booms and almost anything else not otherwiseexplicable. Indeed, it was this same fabulous invention that Robert Golka inrecent years tried to replicate, with considerable success, at Wendover, Utah,for the study of ball lightning, in conjunction with research in nuclear fusion.But what exactly was it? Tesla was asked to describe it for The ElectricalExperimenter in a way that young readers could understand. His explanation(which must have taxed his readers) is tantalizingly vague. “Well, then, in thefirst place,” he wrote, “it is a resonant transformer with a secondary in whichthe parts, charged to a high potential, are of considerable area and arranged inspace along ideal enveloping surfaces of very large radii of curvature, and atproper distances from one another thereby insuring a small electric surfacedensity everywhere so that no leak can occur even if the conductor is bare. Itis suitable for any frequency, from a few to many thousands of cycles persecond, and can be used in the production of currents of tremendous volume andmoderate pressure, or of smaller amperage and immense electro-motive force. Themaximum electric tension is merely dependent on the curvature of the surfaces onwhich the charged elements are situated and the area of the latter.”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos928114]One hundred million volts, he declared, were perfectly practicable. Such acircuit could be excited with impulses of any kind, even of low frequency, andwould yield sinusoidal and continuous oscillations like those of an alternator.“Taken in the narrowest significance of the term, however,” Tesla wrote, “it isa resonant transformer which, besides possessing these qualities, is accuratelyproportioned to fit the globe and its electrical constants and properties, byvirtue of which design it becomes highly efficient and effective in the wirelesstransmission of energy. Distance is then absolutely eliminated, there being nodiminution in the intensity of the transmitted impulses. It is even possible tomake the actions increase with the distance from the plant according to an exactmathematical law.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos928348]Once this powerful equipment was built and the inventor began testing he wasable to emulate the electrical fireworks of even the wildest mountain storms.When the transmitter was operating, lightning arresters in a twelve-mile radiusfrom his station were bridged with continuous fiery arcs, stronger and morepersistent than those produced by natural lightning.For the first time he kept a careful daily diary in which he recorded everyaspect of his research. And because visual effects were useful as well asthrilling, he devoted many hours to photographic experiments.The equipment Tesla was perfecting would, he hoped, one day be adaptable forcommercial use. But first, thousands of observations and delicate adjustmentshad to be made. He no longer trusted his legendary memory to store such a volumeof information. His daily notes referred constantly to experiments that hadfailed to turn out as expected, and he would ask himself why. This process wasat sharp variance with the one he claimed to have used throughout his earlierlife. Now middle-aged, he may have felt his memory waning slightly. Certainly hefelt driven by the pressures of his self-imposed deadline.In his Colorado journal his lifelong fascination with visual phenomena isunderscored. The flashing lights that he had always experienced on the screen ofhis mind were dramatically externalized, and his descriptions, among the mass ofmathematical formulas, are detailed, loving, almost erotic in their lingeringportrayal of the colors and grandeur of his Colorado electrical storms.6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos928475]Nights when experiments were being made with the magnifying transmitter theprairie sky exploded with sound and color. Even the earth seemed alive and thecrash of thunder from the spark gap could be heard for miles. Butterflies weresucked into the vortex of the transmitter coil, which was fifty-two feet indiameter. Awed spectators at some distance from the station told of seeing tinysparks flying between grains of sand and between their heels and the ground whenthey walked. They said that at three hundred feet away, arcs an inch long couldbe drawn from grounded metal objects.7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos928712] Horsesgrazing or trotting peacefully half a mile away would suddenly go berserk,feeling shocks through their metal shoes.The inventor and his assistants, working nightly amidst thunder and lightning,stuffed cotton in their ears and wore thick cork or rubber soles on their shoes.Even so, Tesla described a frequent bursting sensation in the ears, somethingalmost as positive as touch, and feared damage to their eardrums. Often the painand buzzing they felt continued for hours after a test.Hertz’s research of 1888, which confirmed Maxwell’s dynamic theory of theelectromagnetic field, had convinced scientists that electromagnetic wavespropagated in straight lines, like light waves. Therefore it was generallybelieved that radio transmission would be limited by the curvature of the Earth.Tesla, as we know, believed not only that the globe was a good conductor butthat the “upper strata of the air are conducting” and “that air strata at verymoderate altitudes, which are easily accessible, offer, to all experimentalevidence, a perfect conducting path.”Until recent years this theory of propagation of radio waves was ignored. In the1950s, however, a number of scientists working on the propagation of very low (3to 30 kHz) and extremely low (1 to 3000 Hz) electromagnetic waves confirmedTesla’s principle insofar as they apply to low-frequency transmissions. As theworld authority on electromagnetic wave theory, Dr. James R. Wait, has observed,Tesla’s experiments at Colorado Springs, “predate all other electromagneticresearch in Colorado . . . [and] his early experiments have an intriguingsimilarity with later developments in ELF (extra-low frequency)communications.”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos929094] Infact, the Tesla magnifying transmitter was the first in the world powerfulenough to create ELF resonance in the earth-ionosphere wave guide.He was equally prescient in a prediction made at this time that the Earthresonates at 6, 18, and 30 Hz. He later tried to verify this with equipment hebuilt on Long Island, but not until the 1960s would the experiments that he hadwanted to carry out be made by others. It was then found that Tesla had beenremarkably close to the mark: The Earth resonates at 8, 14, and 20 Hz.Since his wireless power-transmission concept involved Earth resonance, thecloser he could bring his operational frequency to that of the Earth the betterit would be for producing very large movements of power in his system. But lowfrequencies presented a difficult problem insofar as the length of his secondarywinding was concerned. For example, for his magnifying transmitter, whichoperated at 50 kHz, the winding length was approximately 0.9 miles. At 500 Hz,the length would have had to be ninety miles.Progress reports and requests for shipments were scorching the telegraph wiresbetween Tesla and Scherff. Regular freight was too slow for the inventor, so heordered Scherff to use expensive railway express. The presence of Kolman Czitowas commanded. Tesla wrote Scherff, advising him that Czito’s salary of $15 perweek was to be paid to his wife. Soon he was able to report, “Czito has justarrived and I was glad to see a familiar face again. He looks a little too fatfor the work I expect of him.”There was also discussion by telegraph about the two hundred bottles Tesla hadordered and about the eight-foot balloons that, according to Scherff, Mr. Myersfeared “would not rise at the altitude where you are if it should be windy.”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos929392] Theballoons were to hoist stationary antennae into the high thin air. Eventuallythey were designed by a professional at $50 each and were to be filled onlytwo-thirds full (probably with hydrogen) to avoid breakage at a great height.Scherff, knowing of his hunger for news, kept him advised of every detail of theprogress at home and especially informed him of the movements of Colonel Astor,his major financial backer. He also reported on the activities of Marconi and onmatters related to Tesla’s European patents.Busy as both men were, they found time to exchange the slightest tidbits ofgossip or instruction. “Mr. L.” said Scherff, “has been coming to the shopintoxicated and making many errors in his drilling.” And Tesla admonished, “TellMr. Uhlman not to write yours truly, but sincerely;” and signed his own letterto Scherff, “Yours sincerely.” He added an anxious P.S.: “Has my friend JJA[Astor] called?”To Scherff he enlarged on the problems of security and promised him reflectedglory: “Do everything you can intelligently keeping the interest of my effortsin view and be particularly careful to any press representatives. I do not wantyou to say anything except what I state here. I think when I come back I shallhave something to say…. You must all be as part of myself, then I shall pull youwith me to success.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos929589]On August 16 he wrote to “My dear Luka” to thank him for his poem, “Dewey atManila,” which was “simply great,” and added: “I wish you could see thesnowdrops and icebergs of Colorado Springs! I mean those that float in the air.They are sublime, next to your poems, Luka, the finest things on Earth! Kindregards to all from your Nikola.”But a little later he again wrote Johnson on a less ecstatic note. “The wirelesstorpedo got on the scene just a trifle too late and Dewey slipped into thegallery of immortal conqueror—but it was a close shave! Luka, I see every daythat we are both too far ahead of our time! My system of wireless telegraph isburied in the transactions of a scientific society, and your great poem on theheroes of Manila did not even as much as save Montojo, and just as my enemiesmaintain that I am merely writing ideas of others, so yours will say that it isbecause of your poem that Montojo was condemned!“But we shall continue in our noble efforts, my friend, not minding the bad andfoolish world, and sometime . . .

His vision and hearing, both of which were alwaysacute, responded to an extraordinary degree to the clarity of the air. Theclimate was ideal for his observations. The sun’s rays were fiercely intense,the air dry, and the frequent lightning storms of almost inconceivableviolence.12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos929990]In mid-June, with all of his equipment installed and preparations for varioustests going forward, he arranged one of his receiving transformers with a viewto determining experimentally the electrical potential of the globe. Inaccordance with a careful plan, he wished to study its periodic and casualfluctuations.He placed a highly sensitive device controlling a recording instrument in hissecondary circuit, and, with the primary connected to the ground, he placed thesecondary on an elevated terminal. This produced a surprising result: Thevariations of electrical potential gave rise to electrical surgings in theprimary; these generated secondary currents, which in turn affected thesensitive recorder in proportion to their intensity.“The earth,” Tesla later reported in an article, “was found to be, literally,alive with electrical vibrations, and soon I was deeply absorbed in thisinteresting investigation. No better opportunity for such observations as Iintended to make could be found anywhere.”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos930170]The natural lightning discharges in this part of Colorado were very frequent andsometimes of great violence, on one occasion about twelve thousand dischargesoccurring within two hours, all within thirty miles of Tesla’s laboratory. Manyof them he described as resembling gigantic trees of fire with their trunksupside down. And toward the end of June he noticed a curious phenomenon: Hisinstruments were being affected more strongly by discharges occurring at a greatdistance than by those nearby. “This puzzled me very much,” he wrote. “What wasthe cause?”One night while he was walking home across the prairie with the stars glowingcoldly above, a possible explanation came to him. The same idea had occurred tohim years before when he was preparing his lectures for the Franklin Instituteand the National Electric Light Association, but then he had dismissed it asabsurd and impossible. “I banished it again,” he wrote. “Nevertheless, myinstinct was aroused and somehow I felt that I was nearing a greatrevelation.”14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos930550]"},{"pageContent":"14. BLACKOUT AT COLORADO SPRINGS It was on the 3rd of July [1899]—the date I shall never forget—when I obtainedthe first decisive experimental evidence of a truth of overwhelming importancefor the advancement of humanity.”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos930905]At dusk of that day Tesla had watched a dense mass of strongly charged cloudsgathering in the west. Soon the usual violent storm broke loose “which, afterspending much of its fury in the mountains, was driven away at great speed overthe plains.”He noticed heavy and persistent lightning arcs forming almost at regular timeintervals. Prepared with a recording instrument, he noted that its indicationsof electrical activity became fainter and fainter with the increasing distanceof the storm, until they finally ceased altogether.“I was watching in eager expectation,” he noted in the diary. “Surely enough, ina little while the indications again began, grew stronger and stronger, and,after passing through a maximum, gradually decreased and ceased once more. Manytimes, in regularly recurring intervals, the same actions were repeated untilthe storm which, as evident from simple computations, was moving with nearlyconstant speed, had retreated to a distance of about 300 kilometers. Nor didthese strange actions stop then, but continued to manifest themselves withundiminished force.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos931101]Soon Tesla felt sure of the true nature of the “wonderful phenomenon. No doubtwhatever remained: I was observing stationary waves.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos931304]He summed up the implications of this discovery thus: “Impossible as it seemed,this planet, despite its vast extent, behaved like a conductor of limiteddimensions. The tremendous significance of this fact in the transmission ofenergy by my system had already become quite clear to me.“Not only was it practicable to send telegraphic messages to any distancewithout wires, as I recognized long ago, but also to impress upon the entireglobe the faint modulations of the human voice, far more still, to transmitpower, in unlimited amounts to any terrestrial distance and almost withoutloss.”Tesla visualized the Earth as an extremely large container holding an electricalfluid which resonance caused to be formed into a series of waves frozen inposition. It was now certain, he wrote, that stationary waves could be producedin the Earth with an oscillator. “This is of immense importance.”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos931431] Healready knew that power transmission and the sending of intelligible messages toany point of the globe could be achieved in two radically different ways: eitherby a high ratio of transformation or by resonant rise. From the tests withelectrical oscillators he now concluded—and so noted in his diary—that powertransmission would be best served by the first method, but that where a smallamount of energy was needed, as with radio, “the latter method is unquestionablythe better and simpler of the two.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos931558]Later, leading scientists would erroneously criticize him for having made nodistinction between the two functions. And, in keeping with his policy ofsecrecy, he did not trouble to enlighten them. But before Tesla would apply histheories practically, he first had to perfect his equipment. The test for whichhe next prepared called for millions of volts and tremendously heavy currents.No past experience could prepare him for what might happen, except in a generalway. Bolts of his man-made lightning were bound to explode from the top of thetwo-hundred-foot mast and tower structure, but whether they would kill theexperimenters and burn down the station was a risk they would have to take.On the appointed night he dressed neatly and carefully in his black PrinceAlbert coat, donned gloves and a black derby hat, and arrived at the station tofind courageous Czito already waiting. The latter would man the switch, givingTesla the opportunity to observe effects from the doorway of the laboratory. Itwas important for him to watch both the giant coil in the center of the room andthe copper ball on the mast.When all was ready, he shouted, “Now!”It had been prearranged that on the first test the switch was to be closed foronly a single second. Accordingly, Czito slammed it in, watched the second handon his pocket watch, and almost instantly pulled it out. The effects in thatbrief instant were rewarding: threads of fire had crowned the secondary coil andelectricity snapped above.For the main event Tesla wanted to watch from outside where he would have aclear view of the mast and ball.“When I give you the signal,” he told Czito, “I want you to close the switch andleave it closed until I give you the signal to open it.”In a moment he called, “Now! Close the switch!”Czito followed orders and stood poised to pull it out again on command. Thevibration of heavy current surging through the primary coil made the ground feelalive. There came a snap and a roar of lightning exploding above the station. Astrange blue light filled the interior of the barnlike structure.Czito looked up to see the coils a mass of surging, writhing snakes of flame.Electrical sparks filled the air and the sharp smell of ozone stung hisnostrils. Lightning exploded again and again, building to a crescendo, and stillCzito waited for the order to yank open the switch. Unable to see Tesla from hispost, he began to wonder if the inventor had been struck by lightning and layinjured or dead outdoors. To continue seemed madness. In another moment hefeared the walls and roof of the station would be aflame.Tesla, however, was neither injured nor dead. He was frozen in a paroxysm ofbliss. From where he stood he could see the lightning bolts shooting 135 feetfrom the top of the mast, and as he later learned, the thunder was being heardfifteen miles away in Cripple Creek. Again and again the lightning surged andcrashed. Sublime! Had ever a human being felt more in tune with the gods? Howlong he stood there he had no idea. Later it turned out to have been only aboutone minute.But suddenly, inexplicably, all was silent. What could have happened? He shoutedto Czito: “Why did you do that? I did not tell you to open the switch. Close itagain quickly!”Czito, however, had not touched the switch. The power was dead. God in His mercyhad sent him a reprieve.Tesla rushed to a telephone and called the Colorado Springs Electric Company. Hebegan remonstrating and pleading. They had cut off his power, he charged, andmust restore it at once.The reply from the powerhouse was curt and to the point.“You’ve knocked our generator off the line, and she’s now on fire!”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos931806]Tesla had overloaded the dynamo. The town of Colorado Springs was in darkness.As soon as the fire was extinguished a standby generator was put into service,but Tesla’s request to be served by it was brusquely denied.Determined to continue his experiments, he offered to take a team of skilledworkmen to the powerhouse and repair the main generator at his own expense. Theoffer was accepted. Within a week the repairs had been made, and Tesla was oncemore provided with electricity.Thereafter his experiments progressed smoothly. Scherff continued to ship newapparatus to him through the icy Colorado fall and winter. To encourage theinventor he wrote, “Mr. Lowenstein has told Mr. Uhlman and me something of yourwonderful work, and we know that, instead of a century, you are a thousand yearsahead of others.”Unfortunately, we have only an imperfect idea of some of the things Teslaattempted—and, for all we know, accomplished—during this period. His diary notesand later writings are often maddeningly unenlightening. For example he appearsat one point to have been experimenting with the production of some kind ofpotent ray. Among the items rushed to him by express were four double-focusRoentgen tubes with thick platinum targets; and one journal entry reads:“Arrangements with single terminal tube for production of powerful rays. Therebeing practically no limit to the power of an oscillator, it is now the problemto work out a tube so that it can stand any desired pressure….”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos931973] Theexact purpose or results of these experiments are unknown, but for furtherinformation, please see chapters 29 and 30.The general thrust of his inquiries is, of course, clear. He tested highpoweroscillators, wireless transmission of energy, the reception and transmission ofmessages, and the related effects of high-frequency electric fields.Whatever their nature, his experiments seldom lacked glamor. Despite the warningsigns he had put up on the fences and building, he had been disturbed byneighborhood boys peering in through a single window in the rear. Tesla had itnailed up. As a result of this, he came as near to being killed as ever beforein his risk-taking life.“It was a square building, in which there was a coil 52 feet in diameter, aboutnine feet high,” he later recalled. “When it was adjusted to resonance, thestreamers [of electricity] passed from top to bottom and it was a most beautifulsight. You see, that was about fifteen hundred, perhaps two thousand square feetof streamer surface. To save money I had calculated the dimensions as closely aspossible and the streamers came within six or seven inches from the sides of thebuilding.”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos932141]The main switch for handling the heavy currents had proved hard to pull. To makeits operation easier, Tesla had installed a spring that would cause it to snapclosed at the merest touch. This innovation was soon revealed as more convenientthan safe.On the day in question Tesla had sent Czito downtown and was experimentingalone. “I threw up the switch and went behind the coil to examine something.While I was there, the switch snapped in, when suddenly the whole room wasfilled with streamers, and I had no way of getting out. I tried to break throughthe window but in vain as I had no tools, and there was nothing else to do thanto throw myself on my stomach and pass under.“The primary carried 50,000 volts, and I had to crawl through a narrow placewith the streamers going. The nitrous acid was so strong I could hardly breathe.These streamers rapidly oxidize nitrogen because of their enormous surface,which makes up for what they lack in intensity. When I came to the narrow spacethey closed on my back. I got away and barely managed to open the switch whenthe building began to burn. I grabbed a fire extinguisher and succeeded insmothering the fire….”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos932396]He wrote a Dear Luka letter in which he metaphorically alluded to having tamed awildcat and to being a mass of bleeding scratches.“But in the scratches, Luka,” he wrote, “there lives a mind—a MIND! Well, I donot want to say much, but…“I have made splendid progress in a number of lines but—how grieved I was tofind that a number of my confreres of wireless telegraphy—of the syndicatingkind—have been indulging in an awful lot of lying! Not a single of thecontentions they have brought forth is true and my system, Luka, is used—pureand simple—without the slightest departure….”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos932523]This referred to Marconi who, working with the English Post Office electrician,William Preece, had sent a wireless signal eight miles across the BristolChannel two years earlier and who now, in 1899, had just repeated thisperformance across the English Channel.Edison, reminded of his own unpromising experiments sixteen years before, nowwould begin to wonder if he might have the basis for a lawsuit against the youngItalian. As it happened, he later would be awarded $60,000 from the MarconiWireless Telegraph Company for his patent. But in truth, perhaps because of hisdeafness, Edison had never really believed that the “radio craze” would last.As for Tesla in Colorado, he confided to Robert Johnson that he was absolutelysure he would transmit a message to the Paris Exposition of 1900 withoutwire—“my greeting to the crazy French!” He closed on a familiar note: “I havenot yet found time to carry out my promise of becoming a millionaire, but Ishall do so at the earliest opportunity….”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos932729]What exactly did Tesla achieve during his sojourn in Colorado Springs? Certainlyall the mystery, the furious activity, the considerable expense, and theperiodic theatrical effects failed to produce any single practical invention—ifby practical one means a telephone or a better bobbin. Judged by “Edisonian”standards, however, one might as well protest that Einstein invented no electricdishwasher.But did Tesla during this period, then, make significant contributions to newknowledge? The answer is yes. Scholars do not know and may never know the fullrange of his explorations, and there is the further problem that he often didnot follow up on his intuitions, theories, and preliminary experiments to thepoint of verification. But he certainly made significant fundamentalcontributions as his scientific successors in several fields continue todiscover. (See chapter 30.)The eminent Yugoslav physicist Dr. Aleksandar Marinčić points out that todaywhen we have proof of the Earth’s resonant modes and know that certain waves canpropagate with so little attenuation that standing waves can be set up in theearth-ionosphere system, “we can judge how right Tesla was when he said that themechanism of electromagnetic wave propagation in ‘his system’ was not the sameas Hertz’s system with collimated radiation.” In his introduction to Tesla’sColorado Springs Notes, Dr. Marinčić observes that the scientist could not,however, have known “that the phenomena he was talking about would only becomepronounced at very low frequencies”; and he surmises that further study ofTesla’s writings “will reveal some interesting details of his ideas in thisfield.” The diary especially throws light on his part in the development ofradio, and there is no longer a question of his mastery of wireless transmissionas early as 1893.In part, however, scholars can only try to reconstruct what Tesla thought he hadaccomplished.With his giant oscillator he believed he had set the Earth in electricalresonance, pumping a stream of electrons (at that time, a flow of electricity)into it at a rate of 150,000 oscillations per second. The resulting pulsationshad a wavelength of about 6,600 feet. Tesla concluded that they expanded outwardover the bulge of the Earth, first in increasing circles and then in eversmaller ones yet with growing intensity, and converged at a point on the globedirectly opposite from Colorado Springs—that is, slightly west of the Frenchislands of Amsterdam and St. Paul in the Indian Ocean.Here, according to his experimental results, a great electrical “south pole” wascreated with a stationary wave that rose and fell in unison with histransmissions from his “north pole” at Colorado Springs. Each time the wavereceded, it was reenforced and sent back more powerfully than before to theantipode.12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos932857]Had the Earth been capable of perfect resonance, the results could have beencatastrophic, but since it was not, the effect, he believed, was merely to makeavailable at any point on the Earth energy that could be drawn off with a simplepiece of equipment. This would include the elements of a radio tuning unit, aground connection, and a metal rod the height of a house. Nothing more would beneeded to absorb household electricity from the waves rushing back and forthbetween the electrical north and south poles. He did not, however,satisfactorily prove this claim, let alone apply it. Nor has anyone else.With his magnifying transmitter he had produced effects at least in somerespects greater than those of lightning. The highest potential he reached wasabout 12 million volts, which is insignificant compared to that of lightning,yet far higher than anyone else produced for many decades thereafter. What heconsidered more significant, however, was that he obtained in his antennacurrent strengths of 1100 amperes. The biggest wireless plants for many yearsthereafter used only 250 amperes.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_060.html#filepos1165637]One day, working with such currents, he succeeded, to his surprise, inprecipitating a dense fog. There was a mist outside, but when he turned on thecurrent the cloud in the laboratory became so dense that he could not see hishand inches in front of his face. From this he concluded that he had made animportant discovery. “I am positive in my conviction,” he said later, “that wecan erect a plant of proper design in an arid region, work it according tocertain observations and rules, and by its means draw from the ocean unlimitedamounts of water for irrigation and power purposes. If I do not live to carry itout, somebody else will, but I feel sure that I am right.”This idea too went into his legacy of unfinished business, and to this date noone has implemented it.It has been reported by various writers that during his power transmissionexperiments in Colorado, Tesla succeeded in lighting up a bank of two hundred50-watt incandescent lamps wirelessly, at a distance of twenty-six miles fromhis station. In his own writings, however, no such claim was ever made, nor isthere other evidence that he did so. What he actually wrote was that, by use ofthe magnifying transmitter, he had passed a current around the globe sufficientto light more than two hundred incandescent lamps.“While I have not as yet actually effected a transmission of a considerableamount of energy, such as would be of industrial importance, to a great distanceby this new method,” he would write on returning East, “I have operated severalmodel plants under exactly the same conditions which will exist in a large plantof this kind, and the practicability of the system is thoroughlydemonstrated.”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos933027] He alsowrote that he had observed the transmission of signals up to a distance of 600miles.That was as specific as he cared to be on the subject. Two other remarkablescientific achievements, however, were to result from his months of concentratedresearch in Colorado.In a diary entry dated January 3, 1900, after describing the taking of somelaboratory photographs, he mentioned watching the formation of sparks intostreamers and “fireballs.”14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos933263] Balllightning, or fireballs, is a phenomenon that has fascinated and baffledscientists from ancient times to the present. Fireballs are mentioned onEtrurian monuments, in the works of Aristotle and Lucretius, and in the writingsof the modern atomic scientist Niels Bohr. Arago analyzed some twenty reports offireballs in 1838. Some scientists have maintained that they are merely opticalillusions, and so Tesla himself thought until they began to appear accidentallyon his high-voltage equipment in Colorado.These strangely ephemeral objects, unlike regular lightning, move slowly, almostparallel to the ground. They have been known to appear in airplanes in flight,move eerily along the floor of the cabin, and after no more than five secondsvanish. In modern plasma physics the most commonly held theory is that thefireball receives its energy from its surroundings by a naturally createdelectromagnetic field, and that the diameter of the plasma sphere depends uponthe frequency of the external field, so that a resonance occurs. But the returnsare still not in, and scientists continue to differ (see chapter 30).Nevertheless, Tesla’s speculations do accord with some hypotheses. He thought,for example, that the initial energy was insufficient to maintain the fireballand that there must be another source, which he believed came from otherlightning passing through the fireball’s nucleus. For him fireballs were merelya fascinating nuisance, yet he took the time to follow this apparently uselessresearch wherever it might lead—and in the process claimed that he had learnedhow to create the phenomenon at will.15[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos933443] Modernscientists, using the most powerful nuclear accelerators, have tried and failedto replicate his achievement (although the fascinating, and potentiallyvaluable, nuisance still occurs unasked).Another of Tesla’s claimed discoveries at Colorado Springs came late one nightas he was working at his powerful and sensitive radio receiver. Only elderly Mr.Dozier, the carpenter, remained on duty. Suddenly the inventor became aware ofstrange rhythmic sounds on the receiver. He could think of no possibleexplanation for such a regular pattern, unless it were an effort being made tocommunicate with Earth by living creatures on another planet. Venus or Mars hesupposed to be the more likely sources. No one at that time had ever heard ofsuch phenomena as regular sounds from space.16[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos933571]Thrilled and awestruck, he could only sit and listen. Soon he became obsessedwith the idea of returning the signal: There must be a way.The probable explanation of what he had heard was radio waves from the stars.Not until the 1920s were such counting codes again picked up by astronomers (andgiven official credence); and in the thirties they began to be transmitted ascoded numbers into a digital recorder. Nowadays “listening” to the stars iscommonplace.Although Tesla could not doubt the testimony of his ears, he could neverthelessanticipate the ridicule of his fellow scientists when they heard the news. Hewas therefore slow to reveal his discovery. And the reaction when it came wasall that he might have guessed.Professor Holden, the former director of the University of California’s LickObservatory, was the quickest to criticize: “Mr. Nikola Tesla has announced thathe is confident that certain disturbances of his apparatus are electricalsignals received from a source beyond the earth,” he told a reporter. “They donot come from the sun, he says; hence they must be of planetary origin, hethinks; probably from Mars, he guesses. It is the rule of a sound philosophizingto examine all probable causes for an unexplained phenomenon before invokingimprobable ones. Every experimenter will say that it is almost certain that Mr.Tesla has made an error, and the disturbances in question come from currents inour air or in the earth. How can anyone possibly know that unexplained currentsdo not come from the sun? The physics of the sun is all but unknown as yet. Atany rate, why call the currents ‘planetary’ if one is not quite certain? Whyfasten the disturbances of Mr. Tesla’s instrument on Mars? Are there no cometsthat will serve the purpose? May not the instruments have been disturbed by theGreat Bear of the Milky Way or the Zodiacal light? There is always a possibilitythat great discoveries in Mars and elsewhere are at hand. The triumph of thescientists of the past century are still striking proof, but there is always astrong probability that new phenomena are explicable by old laws. Until Mr.Tesla has shown his apparatus to other experimenters and convinced them as wellas himself, it may safely be taken for granted that his signals do not come fromMars.”17[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos933861]But the last thing Tesla intended to do just then was to disclose his apparatusto other scientists. His work in Colorado was finished. The New Year, 1900,arrived and went almost unnoticed by the inventor, who was in the midst ofpreparations to dismantle his equipment and depart.Tesla, at least, seemed perfectly satisfied with what he had achieved inColorado. He had made lightning dance at his command; he had used the wholeEarth as a piece of laboratory equipment; and he had received messages from thestars. Now he was in a hurry to get on with the future."},{"pageContent":"15. MAGNIFICENT AND DOOMED When he reached New York in mid-January 1900, reporters and magazine editorspounced upon him.Predictably, the eastern scientific fraternity had echoed Professor Holden indenouncing Tesla’s claim to have received a message of extraterrestrialorigin—at least, without telling them how he did it. But Tesla’s offense wasgreater than that. The signals, as he had written to Julian Hawthorne of thePhiladelphia North American just before leaving Colorado, indicated to him that“intelligent beings on a neighboring planet” must be scientifically moreadvanced than Earthlings, a suggestion not easily swallowed by doctors ofphilosophy.Tesla burned to reply to these “messages” from outer space. Certain that he wasat the forefront of a broad, revolutionary technology, he immediately beganfiling new patents for radio and the transmission of energy, based on hisColorado experiments.As a first step, he envisioned building a world radio center offering all theservices enjoyed today—interconnected radio-telephone networks, synchronizedtime signals, stock-market bulletins, pocket receivers, private communications,radio news service. He referred to it as a world system of intelligencetransmission.The first patent that he filed on his return (No. 685,012) was a means forincreasing the intensity of electrical oscillations, the medium for doing sobeing liquefied air to cool the coil and thus reduce its electrical resistance.He also received two other patents in 1900 and 1901 related to buried powertransmission lines and the method of insulating them by freezing a surroundingdielectric medium such as water. One, a reissued patent (No. 11,865), referredto a “gaseous” cooling agent—apparently a key word that had been inadvertentlyomitted from his original patent No. 655,838. He was therefore one of theoriginators of cryogenic engineering.Many years later, in the 1970s, developmental projects were initiated inAmerica, Russia, and Europe for methods of using superconductors to transmitunderground bulk electrical power, employing various cryogenic enclosures.Brookhaven National Laboratory at Upton, New York, has been at the forefront ofthis international effort. Brookhaven’s method resembles Tesla’s except that theobject of the modern work has been to cool the conductor to a few degrees aboveabsolute zero. The similarity moves closer, however, when considering Tesla’s1901 patent No. 685,012, in which he describes the supercooling of conductors toappreciably lower their resistance, thereby minimizing their dissipation whenconducting current. This is yet another instance in which his pioneer work hasgone unacknowledged—possibly because it might open a door for the U.S. PatentOffice to invalidate later claims.The race to be first with long-range radio transmission appeared to favorMarconi, of whose success the world press had made much during Tesla’s absence.Tesla scorned the paltry efforts being made in America, such as signaling theresults of yacht races on Long Island Sound. He announced a plan to operate hisrobotic boat by radio control at the Paris Exposition—from his office inManhattan!Meanwhile, as George Scherff reminded him, there was a problem of some urgencywith respect to his bank account. He had run through $100,000 during eightmonths in Colorado.To whom should he turn? Colonel JJA? George Westinghouse? Thomas Fortune Ryan?J. Pierpont Morgan? C. Jordan Mott? Although he was being ridiculed in thepress, his reputation among capitalists still remained good. One thing thatimpressed such hard-headed gentlemen was the record of the Westinghouse Companyin maintaining its monopoly of alternating-current patents despite the effortsof competing industrialists to batter down the walls.In a search for new developmental capital he again began frequenting thePlayers’ Club in Gramercy Park, the Palm Room of the Waldorf-Astoria, and, ofcourse, Delmonico’s. To the same purpose he suggested to a willing RobertJohnson that an article for Century magazine be written by Tesla on energysources and the technology of the future. He slaved over this article, which waseventually entitled “The Problem of Increasing Human Energy,” and which appearedin June 1900. Like most of Tesla’s writing it turned out to be a lengthyphilosophical treatise rather than the brisk report on his Colorado researchwhich Johnson had desired. Nevertheless, it created a sensation.Part of this was due to the accompanying photographs—some of the many taken inColorado—in which the inventor resorted to a mild form of trickery involving notjust time exposures but double exposures. They depicted him quietly seated on awooden chair, absorbed in his notes, while enough lightning to kill a roomful ofpeople slashed and snapped around his head. (Even though local photographerswere available in Colorado, he had imported a Mr. Alley, a favorite fromManhattan, to record the experiments made with his magnifying transmitter.) Thetime exposures ran one or two hours in length, which of course produced muchdenser and more dramatic lightning effects than shots of single discharges wouldhave done. And although the occupant of the chair did not simultaneously sitthere—for he would certainly have been electrocuted—Tesla knew that the humanfocus was needed to heighten the dramatic effect.It had been a painful modeling job, for the experiments and hence thephotographs had to be made at night when the weather was usually below zero. Heexplained in his diary how it was done: “Of course, the discharge was notplaying when the experimenter was photographed, as might be imagined! Thestreamers were first impressed upon the plate in dark or feeble light, then theexperimenter placed himself on the chair and an exposure to arc light was madeand, finally, to bring out the features and other detail, a small flash powderwas set off.”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos934190] Thusthe structure of the empty chair in later exposures did not show through Tesla’sbody as if in some weird kind of X-ray photo.The results were as felicitous as even he might have wished for. Everyone whosaw these photographs was astounded. When he sent a print to Professor A. Slaby,who was beginning to be known as the Father of German Radio, the latter repliedthat Tesla must have discovered something unique; he himself had never seenanything like it.The inventor’s Colorado diary discloses that one reason for his constantexperimenting with photographs there was his disappointment with the pictorialresults of his ball-lightning research. Of this he wrote: “A very importantmatter is to use better means of photographing the streamers exhibiting thesephenomena. Much more sensitive plates ought to be prepared and experimentedwith. The coloring of the films might also be helpful in leading up to somevaluable observations.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos934359]He also was thinking further of “the value of powerfully excited vacuum tubesfor the purpose of photography. Ultimately, by perfecting the apparatus andselecting properly the gas in the tube, we must make the photographerindependent of sunlight and enable him to repeat his operations under exactlythe same conditions . . . such tubes will enable him to regulate the conditionsand adjust the light effects at will.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos934495]The Century article with its photographs and predictions thrust him even furtherinto the center of controversy. But though his scientific colleagues sniped, thepress remained generally loyal.“The press at large has of late been having a good deal of fun with Nikola Teslaand his predictions of what is to be done in the future by means ofelectricity,” wrote the Pittsburgh Dispatch (February 23, 1901) fromWestinghouse country. “Some of his sanguine conceptions, including thetransmission of signals to Mars, have evoked the opinion that it would be betterfor Mr. Tesla to predict less and do more in the line of performance.“Nevertheless a recent decision in the U.S. Circuit Court for the SouthernDistrict of Ohio fully recalls the fact that Tesla is by no means without hisrecord of complete and thorough achievement….“Mr. Tesla has a wealth of enthusiasm and fertility of imagination with regardto the future that naturally evokes witticisms. But anyone is ignorant of therecent history of electricity who does not know that Tesla stands in the frontrank of electrical inventors, by what he has actually accomplished.”From the electrical-engineering editor Thomas Commerford Martin came eloquentsupport: “Mr. Tesla has been held a visionary, deceived by the flash of casualshooting stars; but the growing conviction of his professional brethren is thatbecause he saw farther, he saw first the low lights flickering on tangible newcontinents of science. . . .”Publicity—whether good or bad—was precisely what Tesla wanted, for he stilldesperately needed to attract the attention of potential backers. One of thefirst (though not necessarily most important) to step forward was StanfordWhite, the celebrated architect. The two men met one evening at the Players’Club, which White had just remodeled, and, feeling an immediate rapport, soonfell into an intense conversation. White had read and been excited by Tesla’svision of the future as painted for Century magazine. When the inventor began todescribe the physical plant that he envisioned for his world broadcastingsystem, the architect became an eager partner in the grand plan.Nor was this grand plan a mere fantasy. Even while Tesla had still been inColorado, oscillators and other equipment were being assembled in his New Yorkshop under the close direction of Scherff and an engineering assistant. Securitywas tight as usual. Immediately upon his return he got in touch with GeorgeWestinghouse, knowing that his engineers could supply the custom-built machineryhe would need.His Colorado experiments, he wrote Westinghouse, absolutely demonstrated thepracticability of establishing telegraphic communication to any point on theglobe “by the help of the machinery I have perfected.” He would need an engineand a direct-current dynamo of at least 300 horsepower on either side of theAtlantic, and these would be expensive.“You will know of course,” he confided, “that I contemplate the establishment ofsuch a communication merely as the first step to further and more importantwork, namely that of transmitting power. But as the latter will be anundertaking on a much larger and more expensive scale, I am compelled to firstdemonstrate such feature to get the confidence of capital….”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos934622] He alsorequested that Westinghouse lend him $6,000, to be guaranteed by his Englishroyalties.The industrialist invited Tesla to ride with him on the train from New York toPittsburgh in his private “palace car” to talk over the whole matter. On thetrip Tesla explained that his plant would surpass in performance the Atlanticcable both in speed and in the ability to send many simultaneous messages. Heproposed that Westinghouse retain ownership of any machinery he furnished andinterest himself to a certain extent in the venture. But Westinghouse hadlearned his lesson in the hard world of finance. He suggested that Tesla explorefinancing among capitalists who were looking for opportunities to invest excesswealth.One such prospect to whom Tesla then turned was Henry O. Havemeyer, otherwiseknown as the Sultan of Sugar because of his impressive monopoly of refineries.Tesla, lavish in gift-giving whether he had money or not, sent a messenger allthe way to Newport, Rhode Island, with an expensive cabochon sapphire ring as awedding present for the Sultan. Alas, his homage was not at once rewarded.Others to whom he confided his plans for the world system included Astor andRyan. Although the full extent of Colonel Astor’s involvement in the project isunknown, Tesla must have had some success, for when the former’s estate wasappraised in 1913, it revealed five hundred shares of stock in the Nikola TeslaCompany.The spring of 1900 passed with Tesla in an agony of frustration. He and Robertread with dismay the newspaper advertisement of F. P. Warden & Company, Bankers:“MONEY . . . Marconi certificates will net you from 100 to 1,000% better resultsthan any labor of yours can produce.” The stock of the British Marconi Companyhad first been offered at $3.00; already it was selling at $22.Tesla, believing that Marconi had infringed his patents, wanted to sue him. Hismood was further inflamed by the final lines of the advertisement: “The Marconisystem is endorsed by such men as Andrew Carnegie and Thomas A. Edison, and bythe press of the entire world. Edison, Marconi, and Pupin are the ConsultingEngineers of the American Company.”There it was—the three of them in cahoots to cheat him of his invention ofradio. Tesla wrote to Robert pretending to feel optimism about the damages hemight recover in such a suit, saying, “I am delighted to learn from the enclosedadvertisement that Andrew Carnegie has such responsibilities. He is a good manto call on for damages. My stocks are on the rise!”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos934830]Of all the people who had read Tesla’s article in Century magazine and beenimpressed by the boldness of his vision, one fitted the inventor’s requirementsperfectly: J. Pierpont Morgan.The two met for a talk about the world system. Tesla instinctively was lessforthcoming than he had been with Westinghouse: no need to distract thefinancier with too much technical information. Instead, he dilated on themes ofmoney and power. He described to Morgan the plan for all wavelength channels tobe broadcast from a single station. Thus the financier would have a completemonopoly of radio broadcasting. Where others in the field were thinking only inlimited terms of point-to-point transmissions, as in ship-to-shore andtransoceanic wireless, Tesla was talking about broadcasting to the entire world.Morgan was interested.Tesla followed up their meeting with a letter on November 26, 1900, describingexactly what he was offering—up to a point. He had already made transmissionsover a range of nearly seven hundred miles, he said, and was able to constructplants for telegraphic communication across the Atlantic and, if need be, thePacific Ocean. He could operate selectively without mutual interference a greatnumber of instruments and could guarantee absolute privacy of messages. He hadall the necessary patents, he added, and was free to enter into agreements.He proposed that his name be identified with any corporation that might beformed, and estimated a cost of $100,000 for building a transatlantic plant and$250,000 for a Pacific plant, with six to eight months to build the former andone year for the latter.6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos935030]He made no mention to Morgan of the wireless transmission of power, not becausehe had given up the idea, but for the prudent reason that it would have madesome of the banker’s existing investments obsolete. In any event Mr. Morgancould not be expected to be enthusiastic about the prospect of beamingelectricity to penniless Zulus or Pygmies.Morgan replied that he would agree to finance Tesla to the extent of $150,000.That, however, he warned, was as far as he would go. Although he advanced only aportion of this sum and although the country was in the throes of rampaginginflation, which caused Tesla’s bankroll to begin shrinking immediately, thelatter was nevertheless ecstatic.The relationship (no doubt a familiar one for Morgan) quickly became like thatbetween courtier and king. Morgan was “a great and generous man.” Tesla’s workwould “proclaim loudly your name to the world. You will soon see that not onlyam I capable of appreciating deeply the nobility of your action but also ofmaking your primary phil-anthropic investment worth 100 times the sum you haveput at my disposal in such a magnanimous, princely way….”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos935238]Morgan, who had no interest in philanthropic business arrangements, responded bysending Tesla a draft of their agreement and asking him to sign over 51 percentinterest in his various radio patents as security for the loan.8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos935434]Tesla sent Morgan a note in which he quoted an admiring comment from ProfessorSlaby, now a German privy councillor in addition to being a renowned scientist:“‘I am devoting myself since sometime to investigations in wireless telegraphywhich you have first founded in such a clear and precise manner. . . . It willinterest you, as father of this telegraphy, to know….’” This would indicate toMorgan the speciousness of claims being advanced by Marconi and others. Teslaalso observed to his patron that neither Raphael nor Columbus could havesucceeded without their wealthy sponsors.With financing apparently assured, Tesla now set about acquiring land on whichto build his transmitter. James D. Warden, manager and director of the SuffolkCounty Land Company, who owned two thousand acres on Long Island, made twohundred acres at Shoreham available to the inventor.9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos935630] Theparcel, isolated and wooded, was adjacent to the farms of Jemima Randall andGeorge Hegeman, and sixty-five miles from Brooklyn. The delighted Teslachristened the site Wardenclyffe and visualized it as becoming one of the firstindustrial parks. Two thousand persons would be employed at the worldbroadcasting station while their families resided in the surroundingdevelopment.In March 1901, Tesla went to Pittsburgh to place orders with Westinghouse forgenerators and transformers. At the same time he had agents in England scoutingthe coastline for a suitable location on that side of the ocean. He was now fartoo busy to think of the Paris Exposition, which came and went without aworld-shaking demonstration by the inventor.W. D. Crow, an architectural associate of White’s, worked closely with Tesla onthe design of a tower, which would have at its peak a giant doughnut-shapedcopper electrode 100 feet in diameter. Later this was changed to resemble thecap of a gigantic mushroom. The octagonal tower, made entirely of wooden beamspreassembled on the ground, would rise from a large brick building. But thetotal height of this fantastic structure posed a worrisome question because ofwind resistance.10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos935789]On September 13 Tesla wrote Stanford White: “I have not been half as dumbfoundedby the news of the shooting of the President [McKinley was shot on September 6]as I have by the estimates submitted by you, which, together with your kindletter of yesterday, I received last night.“One thing is certain: we cannot build that tower as outlined.“I cannot tell you how sorry I am, for my calculations show, that with such astructure I could reach across the Pacific….”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos935917]For a time they considered falling back on an older design utilizing two, orperhaps three, much smaller towers, but eventually a single tower was built thatsoared to a height of 187 feet. Within it was a deep steel shaft that ran 120feet down into the earth. This shaft, encased by a timber-lined well twelve feetsquare and encircled by a spiral stairway, was designed so that air pressurecould raise it to touch the tower’s top platform. Wardenclyffe was a landmark asmagnificent in concept and execution as America’s Golden Age of electricalengineering ever produced. Magnificent and doomed.Because of the inventor’s impatience for delivery of his machinery, Westinghouseassigned a special person to expedite it. But the slowness with which Tesla wasgetting his money from Morgan forced the inventor to take on other work whileawaiting the completion of Wardenclyffe. He moved his offices to New York’sMetropolitan Tower for increased professional visibility.One of his schemes for raising money involved developing a special kind ofinduction motor built by Westinghouse, but there were continuing problems withit. He also installed Westinghouse equipment at the New York Edison plant.Meanwhile, George Scherff went exploring for business opportunities as far awayas Mexico.A great disappointment to Tesla was the government’s continuing failure to orderhis radio-controlled devices for coastal defense. When Congress passed a CoastDefense and Fortification Bill providing $7.5 million, he wrote Johnson thatperhaps half a million would be “invested in Teleautomatons of your friendNikola,” and that the rest undoubtedly would find its way into the “hands andpockets of the politicians.” Even this note of cynicism betrayed unwarrantedoptimism.He soon had cause for bitterness. As the year 1901 drew to a close the worldpress blazoned the news that Marconi, on December 12, had signaled the letter“S” across the Atlantic Ocean from Cornwall to Newfoundland. What astonishedMorgan and many others was that he had done it without anything like the greatplant that Tesla was building.They doubtless did not know that Marconi had utilized Tesla’s fundamental radiopatent No. 645,576 filed in 1897 and issued March 20, 1900. Small wonder thatTesla began to refer bitterly to the “Borgia-Medici methods” by which he wasbeing deprived of credit and fortune. But radio technology was then a mystery tomost scientists, let alone the average investment banker.Angry though he was, Tesla wasted no time on sour grapes but kept his eyes onthe magnificent obsession rising from the farming land of Long Island. At firsthe nursed it along from a private home near the construction site. When Scherffmoved out from Manhattan to expedite the work, Tesla returned to his stylishretreat at the Waldorf-Astoria to keep a finger on the pulse of Wall Street.Each day he and Scherff exchanged several wires and letters. And sinceWardenclyffe was only an hour and a half from New York by train, at least once aweek the inventor, elegantly attired down to his gray spats and accompanied by aSerbian manservant bearing an immense hamper of food, entrained for Long Island.He worried constantly about security. Across the Sound residents of New Havenwatched in fascination as the octagonal tower rose like a mushroom grower’sfantasy above the tree line of the North Shore. As for the townspeople in nearbyShoreham, they believed themselves to be on the brink of fame and industrialprosperity."},{"pageContent":"16. RIDICULED, CONDEMNED, COMBATTED As the “wonder tower” lifted its airy spars ever higher, Tesla drove himself anda large staff without mercy. He sent money to Germany for radio engineer FritzLowenstein’s return, and the latter soon joined the Wardenclyffe team. Anotherwell-known engineer, H. Otis Pond, who had worked for Edison, helped build thelaboratory.Years later Pond was to say that he disagreed with history’s assessment of thetwo inventors. Edison was “the greatest experimenter and researcher this countryhas produced—but I wouldn’t rate him as much of an originator,” he said. Tesla,however, he considered “the greatest inventive genius of all time.”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos936294]Pond often accompanied Tesla on long walks. They were together on the day inDecember 1901 when Marconi sent the first transatlantic signal. “Looks likeMarconi got the jump on you,” he said.“Marconi is a good fellow,” replied Tesla. “Let him continue. He is usingseventeen of my patents.”Pond also recalled Tesla’s worrying about the instruments of war that he hadbeen inventing. He had just launched his model wireless torpedoes in the Sound,encircled a ship with them, and landed them on the beach. “Otis,” he said,“sometimes I feel that I have not the right to do these things.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos936506]The inventor’s hectic schedule often gave the impression that he was three orfour individuals. His New York laboratory had become a meeting place forscientists from all over the world. The nights were filled with socialactivities, arduous experimental work, the writing of patent applications,professional-journal articles, and letters to editors.Seeing and being seen by the “right” people compelled him to function as both aday and night person; nights in a row passed during which he scarcely closed hiseyes. An inevitable consequence of this frenetic schedule was that his friendsbecame compartmentalized, occupying cells of his life that others were unawareof. Intimates such as the Johnsons, for example, had no idea of the prominenceor even the identity of some of his newer confidants, which is not to say thatthey were ever displaced in his affections.The daylight hours were important for beseeching his patron, Morgan, to advancefunds more rapidly; for reminding him that inflation was threatening to sink theship. He met with other potential investors. He pleaded with manufacturers toexpedite machinery and advance credit. And while he remained in New York, hewrote daily letters of instruction to Scherff.One welcome event in this hectic year of 1902 was a visit to the United Statesby England’s famous Lord Kelvin, who proclaimed himself in complete agreementwith Tesla on two controversial issues: 1. that Mars was signaling America; and2. that the conservation of nonrenewable resources was of critical importance tothe world.3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos936633] Kelvin,like Tesla, was convinced that wind and solar power should be developed to helpsave coal, oil, and wood. Windmills, he declared, should be placed on roofs atthe earliest opportunity, to run elevators, pump water, cool houses, and heatthem in winter.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos936946]Edison, however, differed with his distinguished contemporaries, putting off theevil day of shortages for “more than fifty thousand years.” The forests of SouthAmerica alone, he argued, would provide fuel for that long.When Kelvin expressed high praise for the “scientific prophets” of America, itwas an obvious appreciation of Tesla and came as balm for the inventor’s spirit.After a banquet in Kelvin’s honor at Delmonico’s, the Englishman proclaimed thatNew York was the “most marvelously lighted city in the world,” and the only spoton Earth visible to Martians.Perhaps inspired by the excellent wine, he declared, “Mars is signaling… to NewYork.” The announcement made headlines in all the next day’s papers. When Teslahad made a similar assertion, the air had been filled with controversy. Now thata man of Kelvin’s stature had said it, not a single demurrer was raised by thescientific community, even including Professor Holden. This sudden change ofattitude inspired Tesla’s friend Hawthorne to write a misguided article thatwent farther than Kelvin’s sensational announcement. Obviously, he wrote, themen of Mars and of other older planets had been visiting the Earth and lookingit over year after year, only to report back, “They’re not ready for us yet.”However, once Nikola Tesla had been born, things had changed. “Possibly they(the starry men) guide his development; who can tell?”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos937073]This one line alone may indict the romantic Hawthorne for planting the seedlater nourished by those who would adopt Tesla as their pet Venusian and in sodoing harm his scientific reputation.Thus, Hawthorne went on, it had been the inventor in the lonely observatory onthe mountain-flank for whom the first message was gently rapped out. “Anothermight have heard it and neglected it…. But Tesla, whose brain, compared withthose of most of his contemporary scientists, is as the dome of Saint Peter topepper-pots, had been trained to the hour, and the signal was not in vain.”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos937307]Although no one ever accused Nikola Tesla of lacking ego, we may imagine that hehad to grit his teeth when he sat down to his writing desk to thank his friendfor this embarrassing literary flight. “That was very nice,” he wrote, “allexcept the dome of St. Peter’s and the pepper-pots!”Then he prudently changed the subject and went on to speak of his scientificconcerns: “Half the time I am like a man condemned to death and half the timethe happiest of mortals. All is still but hope. It may take centuries but I feelit in every fibre it is coming sure! One thing is settled in my Coloradoexperiments. We can construct a machine which will carry a signal to our nearestneighbors as certainly as across your muddy Skykoll [sic] river. We can alsofeel safe about receiving a message, provided there are other fellows in theSolar System knowing as well as we know how to operate this kind ofapparatus….”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos937434]In June Tesla moved his laboratory from Manhattan out to the new brick buildingat Wardenclyffe. Here, except for the exigencies flowing from the projectitself, the demands on his time would be fewer. Only workers were admitted tothe grounds. The isolation and quiet were just what he needed.What with one thing and another, when he was summoned for jury duty on a murdercase in New York that fall, he put the notice aside and forgot it. Soon, to hisembarrassment, newspaper headlines made him sharply aware of an Americancitizen’s duties: “Nikola Tesla Fined $100—Fails To Show Up for Jury Duty inGeneral Session—Is Sorry Now.” So he was, and reported at once to court where heapologized. He was then excused from duty on the ground of his opposition to thedeath penalty. The New York Times quoted him as saying that capital punishmentwas “barbarous, inhuman, and unnecessary.”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos937658]Marconi remained the hero of the hour in America as elsewhere. Tesla’s doings,by comparison, seemed merely mysterious. In February 1903 the Electrical Agecarried a critical article about “Nikola Tesla—His Work & Unfulfilled Promises.”Wrote the author: “Ten years ago Tesla was the electrician of greatest promise.Today his name provokes a regret that a promise should have been unfulfilled.”It had been too long since he had scored a clear triumph, and he was learninghow short mortal memories could be.By spring (1903) Tesla’s money problems had grown so severe that he was againcompelled to return to New York to try to raise more funds. Even so, he did notentirely put aside his scientific preoccupations. In a note to Scherff, one ofhundreds, he asked that there be sent to Professor Barker of the University ofPennsylvania “the photograph (Roentgen) of the bones of a hand . . . taken inColorado… the tube was operated without wire by my system….”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos937865]When he returned to Long Island, it was for the raising of the fifty-five-ton,sixty-eight-foot dome frame onto the top of the tower. (The plans had called forcovering the dome with copper plates to form an insulated ball, but this wasnever done.) Scherff took the occasion to remind him that funds were dangerouslylow. Creditors were impatient. Even when Morgan sent the remainder of thepromised $150,000, it had scarcely covered outstanding bills. And Tesla feltthat Morgan, with his great power over the national economy, had beenresponsible to a large degree for the rising costs.He wrote the financier on April 8: “You have raised great waves in theindustrial world and some have struck my little boat. Prices have gone up inconsequence twice, perhaps three times higher than they were….”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos938056]Morgan, his capital still heavily committed to railroad centralization and othersensible enterprise, declined to advance more funds. Two weeks later Tesla againwrote: “You have extended me a noble help at a time when Edison, Marconi, Pupin,Fleming, and many others openly ridiculed my undertaking and declared itssuccess impossible….”But Morgan still did not act, and Tesla, now beginning to feel pangs ofdesperation decided to play his final card. So at last he wrote to Morgan andbared his true goal—not just the sending of radio signals but the wirelesstransmission of power.On July 3, he wrote: “If I would have told you such as this before, you wouldhave fired me out of your office…. Will you help me or let my great work—almostcomplete—go to pots?…”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos938261]The answer came eleven days later, addressed to N. Tesla, Esq.: “I have receivedyour letter,” wrote Morgan, “. . . and in reply would say that I should not feeldisposed at present to make any further advances.”12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos938453]Tesla replied that night in Jovian style by going to the tower and setting offsuch a fireworks display as no one had seen before. His tests went on throughthe night and for several thereafter. Residents watched in awe as blindingstreaks shot off from the spherical dome, at times lighting up the sky within aradius of hundreds of miles. Take that, Pierpont Morgan, they seemed to say.When reporters rushed to the scene they were turned away. The New York Sunreported, “Tesla’s Flashes Startling, But He Won’t Tell What He Is Trying For atWardenclyffe. Natives hereabouts… are intensely interested in the nightlyelectrical display shown from the tall tower where Nikola Tesla is conductinghis experiments in wireless telegraphy and telephony. All sorts of lightningwere flashed from the tall tower and poles last night [July 15]. For a time, theair was filled with blinding streaks of electricity which seemed to shoot offinto the darkness on some mysterious errand. When interviewed, Tesla said, ‘Thepeople about there, had they been awake instead of asleep, at other times wouldhave seen even stranger things. Some day, but not at this time, I shall make anannouncement of something that I never once dreamed of.’”Even stranger things? Was it simply a journalistic tease?In Colorado he had achieved voltages of ten to twelve million volts on theantenna sphere of his magnifying transmitter, although he believed that 100million volts were feasible. On his return to New York he applied for anothergroup of patents of which the most important was an “Apparatus for TransmittingElectrical Energy,” related to the Wardenclyffe project, being No. 1,119,732filed in 1902 but not issued until 1914.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_061.html#filepos1165855] Infact it was filed only weeks after Marconi’s transatlantic wireless success.The problems of getting investment capital for unfinished Warden-clyffe werecompounded in the fall of 1903, when the so-called Rich Man’s Panic struck. Now,the chances of wooing Morgan back into the fold seemed more remote than ever.Aided by his loyal friends, Tesla redoubled his efforts to raise money.Lieutenant Hobson pulled all his strings trying to interest the Navy in robotry.Having seen Tesla’s radio-controlled boats and torpedoes in 1898, he urged himto display them in a naval exhibit at Buffalo and set it up so that the inventorwould not have “the usual difficulties of formalities.” But in vain.The naval hero reported that there had been a fight within the Navy aboutTesla’s wireless exhibits—a feud not directly related to his inventions, hesaid, but rather something ongoing between two high officers, resulting in therejection of Tesla’s entry.13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos938646] It ispossible that Hobson was skewing the situation to avoid hurting his friend’sfeelings.Tesla then went to Thomas Fortune Ryan and succeeded in raising a littlesupplemental funding. But it all went into paying off existing creditors, whosebills were beginning to tower like Wardenclyffe itself. He did not need patient,observant George Scherff to tell him where the trouble lay. “My enemies havebeen so successful in representing me as a poet and visionary,” he said, “thatit is absolutely imperative for me to put out something commercial withoutdelay.”In the years ahead he would repeatedly stagger forth from avalanches of debt tostrike out anew on some practical scheme for commercializing his inventions.Whether he was less fortunate as an independent than his old foe Edison, itwould have been hard to say, but certainly their lives were following differentpaths.Edison in his late fifties was wealthy but ill with a variety of afflictions,including mysterious lumps in his stomach that had appeared during his X-rayresearch (they finally vanished). Disappointed in his ore ventures, increasinglydeaf, he had withdrawn from emotional contact with family and friends. He hadgone into semiretirement, was old before his time, and not only could afford,but felt obliged, to hire a full-time bodyguard for himself and his household.Such were the stigmata of success.There was a growing interest in the medical profession in Tesla’s therapeuticoscillator, a small Tesla coil. Doctors and professors phoned from all over thecountry, saying they were constantly receiving inquiries for such high-frequencyapparatus. Scherff told Tesla he could easily start a thriving business inmedical apparatus, with a crew of thirty men and an investment of $25,000. Hepredicted a rapid profit of $125,000, almost as much as Morgan’s totalinvestment in Wardenclyffe.The inventor told him to go ahead with such work at Wardenclyffe but did nothimself seem much interested. Instead he issued two handsome brochures, onedescribing the world system of communication and another, expensively printed onvellum, that announced his entry into the field of consulting engineering.The main work crew were kept busy fabricating and assembling novel devices,blowing glass vacuum tubes, and doing the routine work of firing up the steamgenerator. The latter job was spasmodic: by mid-July of 1903 the paying of coalbills had become a problem. Periodically the crew was laid off.When coal for the Wardenclyffe generator could be afforded, the inventor wiredScherff to stoke up for a weekend of tests and took a train to Long Island. “Thetroubles and dangers are at their height,” he wrote Scherff on one occasion.“Coal problem still awaits solution. The Wardenclyffe specters are hounding meday and night. . . . When will it end?”14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos938896]Scherff, now moonlighting as a bookkeeper for other firms, lent small sums ofmoney when he could. Dorothy F. Skerritt later verified a report that heprobably lent the inventor a total of $40,000 over the years.15[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos939103] “Teslaseemed to have Mr. Scherff hypnotized,” she observed.In an earlier and better time, as the inventor told her, he had been able to getmoney from Morgan just by asking for it. On one occasion the financier signed ablank check and told Tesla to fill in what he needed. Tesla said that the amountwas $30,000. But now Morgan’s disenchantment with Wardenclyffe was final. Tesla,equally firm in his determination to forge on, sent more letters—at firstpersuasive and beseeching, then angry, accusing, and bitter. They pursued thebanker by special messenger everywhere, even to the pier as he embarked on yetanother grand tour of the Continent.Inevitably rumors spread that Morgan had acquired Tesla’s radio patents just toprevent their development; but there was no proof. When bad news whispered alongWall Street, it gained strength from itself. Word that Morgan was dropping outof the world system venture—he actually had been only a lender—convinced otherpotential backers that it must be a soap bubble.Tesla knew such rumors were killing him; but there was little he could do exceptlive each day trying to dodge bill collectors, pleading with other bankers andrich acquaintances, working out scientific problems of the project, seeking tomarket other inventions, and bidding for consultancies.The multiplier effect of his hard luck knew no geographic limits. He was suedfor nonpayment of electricity furnished to the experiment station at ColoradoSprings, and this was odd, considering that Leonard Curtis, one of the owners ofthe City Power Company, had assured him that electricity would be free. The cityof Colorado Springs also sued him, for water bills. Finally the caretaker of hisold experiment station brought an action for unpaid balance of wages due him.Tesla’s response to the city was Teslian. Inasmuch as he had graced it with hispresence and had erected his famous station there, he wrote, he believed itshould feel privileged to pay for the water.He ordered the old lumber from the station sold and the money therefrom paid tothe power company. And finally he returned to Colorado Springs to appear incourt with his attorney to answer the caretaker’s suit. The plaintiff wasawarded a judgment of about $1,000. A sheriff’s sale of laboratory fixtures paidsome of it. The rest Tesla was to pay in $30 increments dragged out overhalf-a-dozen years.Then for a time it seemed as if his luck was turning. Money began trickling infrom the sale of medical coils, which were now being manufactured on an assemblyline at Wardenclyffe for hospitals and research laboratories. And he managed toinvent a new turbine of revolutionary design, which he felt sure would restorehis fortune and reputation.Although partying with his friends continued, there was a new frenetic qualityabout it, as if the celebrants had begun to sense the tragedies ahead and weredetermined to lose no opportunity for laughter.Katharine sent invitations to come and meet the usual parade of celebrities, andreproaches when he failed to do so. One note ended typically: “We shall soon befar away but then you would never know it. You do not need anybody, inhuman thatyou are. How strange it is that we cannot do without you.”16[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos939292]She and Robert were preparing for another sojourn in Europe. Robert’sdilettantism was unflagging. “Mrs. Johnson tells me you are going to dine withthe Countess of Warwick,” he wrote Tesla. “Will you be good enough to ask hergrace if the Warwick vase could have been the original of Keats’ ‘Ode on aGrecian Urn’?”17[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos939514]Significantly, Johnson had begun to worry about whether his holding of stock inthe Nikola Tesla Company might be misconstrued by his employers, in view of theseveral articles and consultations Tesla had been asked to provide to Centurymagazine. He suggested to the inventor that the money he had invested oughtbetter to be construed as a loan, with the stock as security. Such concern aboutconflict of interest implied that Tesla’s stock as a scientist was slipping andthat his name no longer carried the old cachet.Many in the business world appear to have believed that Tesla was stillreceiving “princely” royalties from Westinghouse on his alternating-currentpatents, not realizing that he had been bought out at bargain rates in 1896.This was made clear by an article in the Brooklyn Eagle of May 15, 1905, callingattention to the “expiration” of Tesla’s valuable patents. The newspaperreported that “a great stir” had been created among electricians by announcementthat the patents had expired: “There will be a grand scramble everywhere to makethe Tesla motor now universally used without paying any more royalty to Tesla.The Westinghouses announced they have a number of subsidiary patents, and willfight.”For it to have become known that Tesla was receiving nothing at all would havecast him in a strange light, not to his credit in the world of nonpoets.Late on the night of July 18, 1905, he wrote to Scherff, anxious at not havingheard from him. “The last few days and nights have been simply horrible,” heconfided, referring to an unnamed illness. “I wish I were at Wardenclyffe in apatch of onions and radishes. Troubles are at their height. As soon as thingsare ready I will come out. We must get much better results.”Only days later he wrote of worries about materials and of taking measures toprevent “the kind of accidents we have had before.“I will tell you frankly that it looks blue for this week unless L. carries outhis promise…. I have several chances and many hopes but I have been deceived sooften that I am a pessimist.”He had been experimenting—for what purpose is unknown—with extremelyhigh-pressure jets of water, of about 10,000 pounds per square inch. A tiny jet,if struck by an iron bar, would deflect it exactly as if another bar had hit it.Such streams of liquid power had destructive effects on any metal with whichthey came in contact. One day the cast-iron cap of the pressure cylinder broke,and a large fragment shot past Tesla’s face to tear a hole in the roof.On another day Scherff had his face seared while pouring hot lead into screwholes in the flooring. The lead struck water that had been used earlier to swabthe floor and exploded upward. Tesla, a few feet away, was only slightly injuredbut Scherff was seriously burned. For a while it was feared that he would losehis vision.Considering the dangerous equipment with which the men worked daily, however,the accidents were remarkably few.Hobson, now a busy young naval recruiting officer, traveling all over thecountry yet sandwiching in campaigns for political office as well, never failedto call on Tesla when in Manhattan. He fretted about the inventor damaging hishealth with strain and overwork, tried to lure him to football games at theNaval Academy, and wrote encouragingly from his parents’ home in Greensboro,Alabama. “My father and mother say they would rather meet you than any man inthe world and that you must come down and visit us and rest up from yourherculean tasks….”He wrote from Texas, from trains, from hotels all over the country, and oftenfrom the Army & Navy Club in New York. He spoke of the disappointments of hispolitical candidacy; but in 1903 he finally resigned from the Navy to make asuccessful career of politics.Then on May 1, 1905, “the hero” wrote Tesla of “the greatest happiness that hascome to me”—his forthcoming marriage to Miss Grizelda Houston Hull of TuxedoPark, New York.“Do you know, my dear Tesla,” he wrote, “you are the very first person, outsideof my family, that I thought of. . . . I wish to feel you present, standingclose to me, on this occasion so full of meaning in my life…. You occupy one ofthe deepest chambers of my heart….”18[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos939736]Two years later Hobson succeeded in winning election to Congress from his homestate of Alabama and would serve there until 1915. He would distinguishhimself—to Tesla’s dismay—by becoming a leader of the prohibition movement. Theinventor considered alcohol in reasonable amounts an ambrosia, although hisdevotion to the naval hero would survive such ideological differences.Mark Twain, seventy years of age and relishing his fame, returned to America. Heand Tesla sought each other’s company as often as their work and other demandspermitted, meeting usually at the Players’.Katharine, distressed by Tesla’s commuting to Long Island, scarcely knew fromone day to the next where to send her invitations. “I will be here thisevening,” she wrote, “but suppose you are throughout the week at your countryresidence in the remote wilds of Long Island. However, if you happen to berusticating at your favorite resort, the Waldorf, send me a line when youreceive this and let me know when I may expect you…. I want to see if you havegrown younger, more fashionable, more proud. But whatever you may be you willalways find me the same.”19[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos939938]This invitation was unusual in its use of the singular pronoun; Robertapparently was traveling, or he was otherwise unable to entertain. Almostcertainly Tesla did not accept.But the early winter brought them all together for a holiday celebration onThanksgiving eve. Tesla’s thank-you note to Katharine urged her not to despisemillionaires since he was still hard at work trying to become one. “My stockshave gone up considerably today,” he wrote. “If it continues for a few weekslike this, the globe will be girdled soon.”20[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos940116]Katharine sent another appeal urging him “to come for my sake as I need cheerand who is all potent as you. . . .” He put her off.Christmas he normally spent with the Filipovs. She wrote five days before theYule to remind him, adding, “You must come here tomorrow evening as I want tosee you for many reasons, to know how you are. But why try to enumerate them?You know them all except one. I have something to tell you by way of Germany….When I wrote you last Sunday morning I sent you my first thoughts out of sleep.I knew that you were depressed but did not know why. Please let me have a worddear Mr. Tesla that I may have something to count on, something to expect….”21[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos940294]The winter passed with his anxieties over Wardenclyffe mounting daily until itseemed there would be no end to his trials.The long steaming summer returned to New York, with Tesla’s routine seldomvarying. To Scherff he wrote again of money problems: “Troubles and troubles,but they do just seem to track me. The Port Jefferson Bank will have to getalong with interest, assuming that I can scratch it together.”Soon afterward, however, he hastened to send exciting news. He had had a meetingwith Mr. Frick, the industrialist and nouveau-riche art collector. Sincebecoming manager of the Carnegie Steel Company trust in the 1890s, he hadmanaged to double the size of the plant through the assiduous use of exploitedlabor and cheap materials. Now, enjoying the rewards of his prescience, he wascasting about for new investments. The inventor’s note to Scherff exudedoptimism: “Troubles are many but progress is encouraging. Had a very promisingsession with Mr. Frick and am full of hope he will advance capital stillnecessary.”22[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos940472]At about this time Tesla and Johnson had an editorial exchange over Hertzianwaves. Tesla had sent the latter an article for Century that puzzled Johnsonbecause of his assertion that such waves were not employed in wirelesstelegraphy.“There is Hertzian telegraphy in theory only,” Tesla explained, “since thesewaves diminish very rapidly with distance.” Hertz and Crookes, he said, did notapply sources of power since they used the Ruhmkorff coil and a simple sparkgap. Tesla claimed that he had made no progress in the field until he wasinspired to invent his oscillation transformer, with which he obtained greatlymagnified intensity. He believed, after experimenting with different forms ofaerials, that the signals picked up by the instruments were actually induced byearth currents instead of being etheric space waves.Kenneth Swezey, however, later wrote, “Tesla understood well the nature ofHertzian waves and constantly used them. His obstinacy in refusing to admit thatthese waves played a significant part in the operation of his wireless powerequipment . . . merely helped confuse judges and lose cases for him throughouthis lifetime.”23[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos940703]After his “very promising” session with Frick, the inventor was again forced tosend bad news to Scherff: the negotations had come to nothing.The year 1906 threatened to be, if possible, worse than its predecessor. Evenhis friend Westinghouse seemed to be avoiding him. Tesla’s need for Westinghousemachinery at Wardenclyffe remained almost as urgent as his need for capital.Thus he wrote to the industrialist asking, “Has anything happened to mar thecordiality of our relations? I would be very sorry, not only because of myadmiration for you but for other serious reasons.“The transmission of power without wires will very soon create an industrialrevolution and such as the world has never seen before. Who is to be morehelpful in this great development, and who will derive from it greater benefitsthan yourself?”24[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos940861]Westinghouse, although knowing that without Tesla’s AC patents his firm couldnot have become the lusty adolescent that it was, replied in effect thanks butno thanks.The harrowing routine continued. Scherff wrote that a promised carload of coalhad not yet been delivered and that scheduled tests must be delayed. He alsomentioned tactfully his extra job for two days a month keeping books for asulfur manufacturing firm. This was a bad omen for Tesla, for Scherff would soonbecome a full-time employee of this company.Worse news lay ahead. On June 26, 1906, the newspapers were filled withsensational accounts of the murder of Stanford White. The architect had beenshot three times by a Pittsburgh financier, Harry K. Thaw, the night before onthe roof of Madison Square Garden, while numerous members of the New York “400”looked on. White was believed by the killer to have been involved with his wife,Evelyn Nesbit, in a love triangle. Later Thaw was committed to the MatteawanHospital for the Criminally Insane.But the architect who had given New Yorkers such splendid edifices as MadisonSquare Presbyterian Church, the Garden City Hotel, the Hall of Fame at New YorkUniversity, and the Astor Mansion at Rhinebeck, was gone—leaving the tower onLong Island as his final monument.Scherff left Wardenclyffe that fall. He never ceased, however, to keep an eye onTesla’s financial affairs, working for him on evenings and weekends and almostalways remembering to file his tax returns on time.The world system for broadcasting—a concept designed to incorporate almost everyaspect of modern communications—was all over but the mourning. Yet as long asthe tower stood, Tesla continued his efforts to complete it.Exactly when all the workers left, no one could say. Thomas R. Bayles, thegeneral passenger agent of the railroad station just across the road from theabandoned plant, only noticed that passengers had stopped getting off there. Acaretaker remained on duty for a time. When curious journalists or researchengineers showed up they were allowed to climb to the tower top with itssweeping view of Long Island Sound. For all that the tower looked so light, itwas built entirely without metal, even down to the wooden pegs holding togetherthe wooden uprights and cross members. After abandoning the plan for coveringthe dome with a copper sheathing, Tesla had installed a removable disk throughwhich a beam of radiation could be projected to the zenith.The visitors found the laboratory filled with curiously complex apparatus. Inaddition to much glass-blowing equipment there were a complete machine shop witheight lathes, X-ray devices, a great variety of high-frequency Tesla coils, oneof his original radio-controlled robot boats, and exhibit cases filled withthousand of bulbs and tubes. There were an office, library, instrument room,electrical generators and transformers, and great stocks of wire and cable.25[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos941097] Butafter the watchman left, vandals entered, broke things, ransacked files, emptiedpaper on the floor and trampled them.“It is not too much to say,” wrote a Brooklyn Eagle reporter, “that the placehas often been viewed in the same light as the people of a few centuries agoviewed the dens of the alchemists or the still more ancient wells of thesorcerers. An atmosphere of mystery hung over the place, an unearthly influenceseemed to be radiated from the alembic . . . as if drawn down from interstellarspace and spread over the countryside to inspire wonder and awe in the minds ofthe nearby farmers and villagers….”26[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos941257]In 1912 a judgment of $23,500 against the inventor for machinery supplied to theproject was won by Westinghouse, Church, Kerr & Co. The equipment left at thesite was taken to satisfy it.Tesla, in order to maintain his fashionable mode of life at the Waldorf throughthe years, had given two mortgages on Wardenclyffe to the hotel’s proprietor,George C. Boldt. They secured bills of about $20,000. He had asked that themortgages not be recorded, fearing damage to his financial credibility. When in1915 he was at last unable to make any payments at all, however, he signed theWardenclyffe deed over to Waldorf-Astoria, Inc.27[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos941420]The hotel corporation tried to convert its strange security into cash but no onein those days knew what to do with the ruins of a world broadcasting center. TheWar Department was approached for ideas but nothing came of it. Next it wasconsidered as a site for a pickle factory. Tesla must have wept when he heardthis. But nothing caught on. And in 1917, rumors began to circulate that Germanspies were holed up in the magnificent tower, spying upon Allied shipping andradioing signals to U-boats. On July 4, 1917, an explosion of dynamite wasdischarged inside the tower. Newspapers and even the Literary Digest reportedthat it had been blow up by the U.S. government to halt espionage.28[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos941580] Tesladenied the rumor.In fact the tower was destroyed under a salvage contract between the owners andthe Smiley Steel Company of New York, but the inventor did not wish to disclosethe real owners. And it was destroyed only in an effort to realize a few dollarsfrom scrap.The tower proved to be more strongly built than its destroyers guessed. They hadto keep blasting away as if it were rooted to the spot by some mysterious force.On the ensuing Labor Day it collapsed, dynamite having triumphed at last overthe merely celestial. It brought the corporation $1,750 above salvage costs. Ajunkman noticed some of Tesla’s notes blowing down the street.“I did not exactly cry when I saw my place after so long an interval,” theinventor wrote to Scherff, “but I came very close.”29[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos941894]Marconi, with Carl F. Braun of Germany, won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1909for their “separate but parallel development of the wireless telegraph.”Never for the rest of his life would Tesla give up on his concepts of powertransmission and broadcasting. It was not a dream, he declared, “but a simplefeat of scientific electrical engineering, only expensive— blind, fainthearted,doubting world.”Humanity, he wrote, was not yet sufficiently advanced to be willingly led by“the discoverer’s keen searching sense.” But perhaps it was better “in thispresent world of ours that a revolutionary idea or invention instead of beinghelped and patted, be hampered and ill-treated in its adolescence—by want ofmeans, by selfish interest, pedantry, stupidity, and ignorance; that it beattacked and stifled; that it pass through bitter trials and tribulations,through the strife of commercial existence. So do we get our light. So all thatwas great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combatted, suppressed—only toemerge all the more powerfully, all the more triumphantly from the struggle.”30[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos942088]Next to Tesla and society, the greatest loser when Wardenclyffe fell was Morgan.There can be little question that he could have written his own ticket for anearly lead in radio broadcasting, with a station operating on severaladjacent-frequency channels, transmitting in multiplex mode, and thereby farsurpassing the performance of the slow, single-channel transatlantic cable.Among the many who would use Tesla’s patents in the development of commercialradio (legally or illegally), one firm would soon be sending messages a distanceof 9,000 miles. The clarity of Tesla’s understanding of radio should not beconfused with his efforts to transmit electricity wirelessly. He did not confusethem."},{"pageContent":"17. THE GREAT RADIO CONTROVERSY Errors once committed to print are stubborn. With respect to the invention ofradio, they have permeated many reference sources, histories of science,scientific biographies, and popular journals. The confusion—partly caused byTesla himself—was officially cleared up in 1943 when the U.S. Supreme Courtreversed an initial finding in Marconi’s favor to rule that Tesla hadanticipated all other contenders with his fundamental radio patents.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_062.html#filepos1166376]The radio-engineering fraternity made a major effort to atone in 1956, on theoccasion of Tesla’s one hundredth anniversary. It is strange therefore to findin the Dictionary of American Biography an article on Tesla by an eminentprofessor of electrical engineering and computer sciences, who cites referencesources through the forties, fifties, and sixties—yet completely omits referenceto the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos942448] Evenmore curious, this author cites articles on Tesla by Anderson, O’Neill, Swezey,and Haradan Pratt (Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers), each ofwhom had done careful research to set the record straight. Popular historiansboth in the United States and Europe have consistently repeated the error.Although the news has yet to penetrate encyclopedias, modern radio-engineeringauthorities now accord Tesla clear priority in a field that for years wasconfused by seesawing claims involving such international luminaries, besidesMarconi, as Lodge, Pupin, Edison, Fessenden, Popov, Slaby, Braun, Thomson, andStone, to name only the more famous of the pioneers.Dr. James R. Wait writes: “The simple picture shown based on Tesla’s disclosurein 1893 is the birth of wireless communication. Admittedly, it follows theerudite theoretical and experimental investigations of Hertz who demonstratedthe action at a distance from a spark gap discharge. But, by a few years, itprecedes Marconi’s inventions and practical demonstrations of wirelesstelegraphy.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos942719]images [../Images/00017.jpg] Figures 165 and 185, referred to in the United States Supreme Court case, arefrom Tesla’s 1893 lecture and are frequently cited as evidence supporting hisclaim of invention of radio.Anderson points out that some have confused the argument with respect to theprinciples of transmission and reception of radio signals with the matter oftransmitting voice—an important improvement made practical by DeForest’s Audion,or triode vacuum tube. “In a discussion of priority in the invention of radio,one must be very specific about definitions,” he writes. “In the . . . case ofthe Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America vs. United States (which wasdecided June 21, 1943, against the Marconi Company and striking down thefundamental Marconi patent), the following definition evolved out of theexhaustive depositions taken from many technical experts in the fields of radioand the physical sciences:“‘A radio communication system requires two tuned circuits each at thetransmitter and receiver, all four tuned to the same frequency.’ The definitiondoes not embrace variable modulation that DeForest’s Audion provided and throughwhich the transmission and reception of voice and music was made possible. Itdoes not address the mode of electromagnetic propagation—that is, ground waveand/or sky wave and the effect of the former on the latter. It does, however,implicitly describe the deliberate, selective transmission at a specificfrequency and the selectable reception at that same frequency.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos942902]Marconi’s original patent application was filed on November 10, 1900, and wasrejected on the prior art disclosed by Sir Oliver Lodge. Tesla’s first patentwas granted in 1898. Moreover Tesla was specific as to which of his patents weredirected to wireless power transmission as opposed to signal communication,although this appears to have confused some of the critics of his radio patents.The U.S. Supreme Court found that Tesla’s patent No. 645,576, applied forSeptember 2, 1897, and allowed March 20, 1900, anticipated the four-circuittuned combination of Marconi.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos943057]Tesla, long before anyone else, published in Electrical World and Engineer(March 5, 1904) what has always stood out as the clearest statement by anypioneer working in the wireless art of what radio was to become and as we knowit today. He envisioned the entire concept of transmission of intelligence, notjust the sending of a single message from one point to another—and he alone ofthe pioneers in radio did so.Tesla said his “World Telegraphy constitutes, I believe, in its principle ofoperation, means employed and capacities of application, a radical and fruitfuldeparture from what has been done heretofore. I have no doubt that it will provevery efficient in enlightening the masses, particularly in still uncivilizedcountries and less accessible regions, and that it will add materially togeneral safety, comfort, and convenience, and maintenance of peaceful relations.It involves the employment of a number of plants, all of which are capable oftransmitting individualized signals to the uttermost confines of the earth. Eachof them will be preferably located near some important center of civilization,and the news it receives through any channel will be flashed to all points ofthe globe. A cheap and simple device, which might be carried in one’s pocket maythen be set up anywhere on sea or land, and it will record the world’s news orsuch special messages as may be intended for it. Thus the entire earth will beconverted into a huge brain, capable of response in every one of its parts.Since a single plant of but one hundred horse-power can operate hundreds ofmillions of instruments, the system will have a virtually infinite workingcapacity, and it must needs immensely facilitate and cheapen the transmission ofintelligence.”These ideas were also discussed by him in Century magazine in June 1900following his return from Colorado.Another pioneer of radio, J. S. Stone, said in reviewing a field that includedLodge, Marconi, and Thomson: “Among all those, the name of Nikola Tesla standsout most prominently. Tesla with his almost preternatural insight intoalternating current phenomena that enabled him… to revolutionize the art ofelectric-power transmission through the invention of the rotary field motor,knew how to make resonance serve, not merely the role of a microscope, to makevisible the electric oscillations, as Hertz had done, but he made it serve therole of a stereopticon. . . . [I]t has been difficult to make any butunimportant improvements in the art of radio telegraphy without traveling, partof the way at least, along a trail blazed by this pioneer who, though eminentlyingenious, practical and successful in the apparatus he devised and constructed,was so far ahead of his time that the best of us then mistook him for adreamer.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos943192]Among the many authorities in radio who seconded this view (although perhaps notquite soon enough for justice’s sake) was Gen. T. O. Mauborgne, former head ofthe Signal Corps and chief signal officer of the U.S. Army. In Radio-Electronics(February 1943, only weeks after Tesla’s death), he wrote: “Tesla ‘the wizard’…captured the imagination of my generation with his flights of fancy into theunknown realms of space and electricity . . . [saw] with astounding vision farbeyond his contemporaries, very few of whom realized until many years after thework of Marconi that the great Tesla was the first to work out not only theprinciples of electric tuning or resonance, but actually designed a system ofwireless transmission of intelligence in the year 1893.”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos943319]Even Professor Pupin of Columbia University, testifying as an expert witness forthe Atlantic Communication Company in a suit for alleged infringement of patentbrought by the Marconi Wireless Company of America (Pupin’s side as expertwitness was to change somewhat with time and circumstances), stated on May 12,1910:“When William Marconi was ‘a mere strip of a lad working for Signor Riggie’ inItaly he grounded both wires out of curiosity in an experiment to see what wouldresult and he produced wireless waves without ever fully realizing the fullsignificance of it.” But Pupin gave the credit for discovering wireless toNikola Tesla, who “gave his discovery free to the world.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos943537]Another radio-engineering pioneer, Cdr. E. J. Quinby, USN (Ret.), has recalledfrom his personal experiences in the early days of commercial radio developmentin America:“While others fought bitter word-battles in our courts over whose patents werereally valid on the all-important system of tuning to avoid wholesale radiointerference, nobody seemed to recall that Tesla had covered the subject backbefore the turn of the century with his comprehensive and fundamental patent ontuning of electrical circuits to resonance. Without this feature, today’sever-expanding radio service would be utter chaos. A Supreme Court decision wasfinally reached in 1943, crediting Tesla with having anticipated all the others,thus making subsequent patents on the subject null and void.”Tesla himself failed to accomplish his dream of a world wireless system, Quinbypointed out, but he lived to see this all done by utilization of the system heso clearly outlined.“The high-frequency alternators Tesla built between 1890 and 1895 produced up to20 kHz, despite the critics who said it couldn’t be done, and who accused him ofbeing an impractical dreamer,” wrote Quinby. “It remained for Prof. Reginald A.Fessenden to demonstrate that such machines could produce the required quietcarrier for voice modulation, thus eliminating the background roar of thedamped-wave spark and arc transmitters with which others were experimenting.Fessenden agreed with Tesla, that the damped-wave transmitters were anabomination, and that the future successful radio development rested oncontinuous-wave generators.”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos943706]Thus on Christmas Eve, 1906, and New Year’s, 1907, Fessenden startled anddelighted listeners up and down the East Coast of the United States andprecipitated a flood of fan mail by broadcasting voice and music programs fromhis transmitter at Brant Rock, Massachusetts. He was using a high-frequencyalternator which he built, based on Tesla’s design and principle.During World War I, says Quinby, with the engineering talents of Steinmetz,Alexanderson, and Dempster, the General Electric Company at Schenectadysucceeded in scaling up the small experimental models of radio-frequencyalternators into the giant 200 kw production model, the first of which wasinstalled at the Marconi Worldwide Wireless Station at New Brunswick, NewJersey, to replace the unsatisfactory high-power spark transmitter.Ironically, Tesla was among dignitaries invited to witness the inauguration ofreliable transatlantic service at this station. President Woodrow Wilson’sArmistice terms were carried by radio from the station to Kaiser Wilhelm inApril 1919.Commander Quinby adds: “Later, when President Wilson made his historic voyage toEurope aboard the S.S. President Washington, voice communication was establishedbetween the New Brunswick station and President Wilson while he was atsea—thanks to the pioneering of Nikola Tesla in demonstrating his high-frequencyalternator back in 1895.”Galling as it was to Tesla, however, it remained undeniably true that Marconifirst riveted the attention of the world with his successes in radio andthereafter cleverly held the lead in development with the Marconi WorldwideWireless Company.On May 13, 1915, Professor Pupin testified yet again as an expert witness forthe defendant in a suit brought by Marconi against the Atlantic CommunicationCompany. This time he appeared to suggest that he himself had invented thewireless “before either Marconi or Nikola Tesla had discovered it,” according topress reports of the trial.9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos943984]In his own experiments, he said, he had found a wireless wave but had notrealized its importance. Tesla, he iterated, however, “had given his discoveriesto mankind, and this is one of the points on which the Atlantic Company expertsexpect to deny the claims of Marconi to certain wireless patents.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos944211]Tesla himself sued Marconi at last, in August 1915. The Marconi WirelessTelegraph Company of America also sued the U.S. government for allegedlyinfringing on “Marconi’s” patents during World War I. The war of the wirelesspatents was waged back and forth for decades, and little wonder that confusionensued.A thorough account is contained in Anderson’s “Priority of Invention ofRadio—Tesla vs. Marconi,” a monograph for The Antique Wireless Association (NewSeries) No. 4, March 1980. Anderson reports that radio pioneer Major Armstrongadded an interesting—if somewhat confusing—sidelight to the controversy. Hewrote to Anderson shortly before his own death in 1953, saying that in hisopinion Tesla was the true inventor of the guided weapon (robotry) but thatthere had been efforts to reduce his claim to that invention. Moreover, saidArmstrong, he did not believe Tesla should be advanced as the inventor of radio.“By his writings on the problem of signaling without wires, he fascinated andinspired some of the early workers in the field, Marconi perhaps himselfincluded,” wrote this protégé of Pupin who was now himself a famous inventor inradio.“However . . . he failed to conceive or to experimentally discover that vitalidea uncovered by Marconi which brought practical wireless signaling into being.I have pointed out if he had gone ahead on the basis of his erroneous theory, hewould have been very likely to have discovered the principle that Marconi diduncover and so would have become known as the inventor of wireless telegraphy.But this he failed to do and so the credit quite properly goes to Marconi.”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos944339]Tesla’s fame, Armstrong went on, was “secure on the basis of his accomplishmentsin the power field, and as a prophet of the possibility of wireless, and ofwireless-controlled engines of war.”Armstrong almost appeared to be saying that because Tesla was famous as anexplorer of one continent of science or two, it was unimportant that he be givendue credit in a major third field. Perhaps in part this curious view reflectedthe growing academic commitment to specialization: generalists were out ofstyle, hence the existence of any lurking Leonardo ought to be denied.Armstrong offered to confide to Anderson the “vital secret” that made Marconi’swork a success and Tesla’s a failure. In January 1954 Anderson asked for this.He was distressed shortly afterward to learn of Major Armstrong’s unexpecteddeath. But later, he said, two scientists who knew Armstrong and of his“unswerving championing of Marconi” told him that Armstrong was referring to theground connection in a transmission-reception system. Anderson was stunned.“Every one of Tesla’s patents for either communication or power transmissionshowed the ground connection,” he wrote me. “In fact, the matter of groundconduction was the cornerstone of Tesla’s concept. Nonetheless, and despite thefact that the Marconi patent was declared invalid by the Supreme Court,Armstrong stuck to his position. I guess that’s what confounded me somuch—Armstrong’s overlooking an essential point already so clearly inevidence.”12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos944668]Haraden Pratt, fellow of the Institute of Radio Engineers*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_063.html#filepos1166695] andpast chairman of the IRE History Committee, has written that Tesla’s radio ideasand the apparatus he produced were left for others to pick up and embody forless ambitious but more practical purposes.“For this reason,” he noted, “Tesla’s influence on the development of radio wasknown to but a limited number of people. A few eminent persons who attended orread his lectures during the 1890 decade were inspired by his revelations andsome others, who later delved into the background of the art, became aware ofthe pioneering import of his contributions.“Far ahead of his time, mistaken as a dreamer by his contemporaries, Teslastands out as not only a great inventor but, particularly in the field of radio,as the great teacher. His early uncanny insight into alternating-currentphenomena enabled him, perhaps more than any other, to create by his widespreadlectures and demonstrations an intelligent understanding of them, and inspiredothers not yet acquainted with this almost unknown field of learning, excitingtheir interest in making improvements and practical applications.”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos944836]In sum, it is easier to see in retrospect than during Tesla’s time how the truthcame to be obscured.Ample rewards went to those scientists, inventors, and engineers whosuccessfully got in on the ground floor of commercial radio. Tesla, spendingmore time in his ivory tower than on ground floors, was to be smiled on fitfullyby fame and in the long run ignored by fortune.In his later years an incident occurred that revealed the true depths of hisfeelings about the great radio controversy. On a day in January 1927 a youngYugoslav named Dragislav L. Petković, visiting America, arranged to call uponhim. He then lived on the fifteenth floor of the Pennsylvania Hotel at 34th andBroadway. Times were hard and he had grown reclusive. Petković was invited tohave lunch in his rooms and treated to a spread of California fruits andvegetables, fish, and honey.After conversing for a time, Petković tried to learn the secret of the animositybetween Tesla and Pupin. Once he had asked Dr. Pupin about this matter. Thelatter had burst out, “How long will our people celebrate only mysteriouspersons, instead of what’s clear to everyone to understand?”Now, when he put the same question to Tesla, the inventor frowned and raised hishand as if to protect himself from something very unpleasant. After a pause, heexplained to Petković that in the early days in America, when he and Pupin wereboth struggling to survive, the latter had asked him for help with the Englishlanguage. According to Tesla, he was having difficulty holding a job with thetelephone company. Tesla helped Pupin but later somewhat tactlessly reminded himof the favor. Pupin angrily said that he himself had been quite able to do thework and that Tesla “did not do anything for him.” Tesla was hurt but forgot thematter.Later, however, when he lectured at Columbia College, demonstrating histransformer and his theories of radio and electrical-power transmission, “Mr.Pupin and his friends interrupted my lecture by whistling, and I had difficultyquieting down the misled audience.” But this was not the worst.“During the lawsuit which I’ve instituted against Mr. Marconi for stealing myapparatus and drawings from the Patent Office,” Tesla allegedly continued, “Mr.Pupin, called to testify on my behalf as a countryman, went on the side of Mr.Marconi, who, after three years of legal battle was forced to admit under oaththat the transmission of power to long distances is my invention.”Tesla paused, then added, “Let the future tell the truth and evaluate each oneaccording to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs, the future,for which I really worked, is mine.”With tears in his eyes but with a smile, he resumed his meal. He and the visitorquietly attacked their cantaloupe. Then the visitor asked another question.“Can you tell me something about Mr. Marconi?”It was one of the few recorded occasions when Tesla ever lapsed from courtesy.He laid down his spoon.“Mr. Marconi,” he said, “is a donkey.”14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos945067]"},{"pageContent":"18. MIDSTREAM PERILS The inventor, now aged fifty, his reputation as a scientist under seriousattack, had seldom looked more debonair. He was still slim, smooth-faced, andyoung-looking, his hair as thick and black as ever. He still dressed like afashion plate, had a wide circle of friends, and clung however tenuously to hischerished residence at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.Indeed, Tesla’s relationship with the hotel may have come as close to a marriageas anything he ever experienced. A life not lived regally seemed to him scarcelyworthwhile. Always one to confront disappointment with panache, he seemed tohave a special talent for floating elegantly through the worst of times. It wasnot that he never worried about debts but simply that his mind, preoccupied withideas, could screen them out over long periods. Thus he could chide lessfortunate worriers like Scherff and Johnson for alleged faintheartedness in theface of financial adversity. Yet the psychic importance of money to theinventor, apart from his real need for it, seemed to grow in contrast to itsdeclining accessibility, as his many letters to Johnson, Scherff, and othersmade clear.Although in appearance and in mode of life Tesla was to go on much as before,inwardly he had begun to change. His bitter disappointments in the early yearsof the century exerted a corrosive and lasting effect upon his personality. Hewrote revealingly to George Westinghouse on the latter’s latest enforcedcorporate reorganization to say, “the strength of a man shows itself inadversity.” Unfortunately, adversity also tends to reveal weaknesses.Tesla became an inveterate writer of self-serving letters to newspapers. Wherein palmier years he had been generous in praising the achievements of both hispredecessors and his contemporaries, and had seldom troubled to reply topersonal critics, he now became prickly and shrill in self-defense. He was quickto put down competitors, the weak as well as the powerful, and to claim priorityof discovery on his own behalf. Cheated too often, he grew even more secretivein the protection of his patents. The psychic damage to him had been real anddeep.Tesla was fortunate in the early years of the century to attract two loyal,intelligent women to his staff as secretaries, both of whom went on in lateryears to important careers of their own. Both, needless to say, had trimfigures.Muriel Arbus was a charming blonde who assisted Tesla with patent claims and,after his death, went on to distinguish herself as the head of Arbus MachineTool Sales in New York—the only woman in America at the time to have created herown firm as a buyer of large machine tools. She was extremely successful.Dorothy Skerritt joined Tesla in 1912, witnessed many demonstrations at hislaboratory at 8 West 40th Street, and often went across the street to the NewYork Public Library to do research for the inventor. A person who met both womenobserved that Skerritt “seemed to be more aware of the underlying motivations ofindividuals and sensed the implications of adverse circumstances, yet saidlittle. Arbus, on the other hand, took things at face value and seemed to enjoytalking about them.”Skerritt had worked for a patent-attorney group before joining Tesla andremained with him until 1922. Arbus spent World War II working for the Office ofProduction Management, the War Production Board, and later for theReconstruction Finance Corporation, after which she began her own unusualbusiness.As for their mutual employer, more and more in the years ahead Tesla wouldadvance scientific claims recklessly, discussing them with reporters fresh fromthe moment of inspiration without subjecting his ideas either to experimentalverification or even much reflection. At times he would seem almostmegalomaniacal. Some journalists, interested only in headlines and bylines,quoted him without question, but those who cared for him, like O’Neill andSwezey, sought to save him when necessary from his own announcements.Edison had merely reflected the sniping of the professors when he had taunted,“Tesla is a man who is always going to do something.” But presumably such acharge could have been made against Edison himself by anyone choosing tooverlook the sweep of his solid achievement in favor of his unrealizedaspirations. He too courted reporters, inveterately promising more than he coulddeliver.Professor Joseph S. Ames of the Johns Hopkins University had written an earlyattack on Tesla all too typical of the view from academe, a comparison of theworks of Marconi, Pupin, and Tesla in which the latter came off a miserablethird: “The Tesla motor, so called, and the electrical machines which aremodifications of it, are known to the world, and so is the ‘Tesla coil,’ whichis a simple improvement of one of Henry’s instruments; but as yet no discoverybears his [Tesla’s] name….”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos945467]This attack, like others of its ilk, was, of course, simply wrong-headed. By thelate 1920s $50 billion would be invested in Tesla’s nineteenth-century inductionmotors and systems of power transmission throughout the world. He was “thefather of radio” and of automation. Most universities, including Johns Hopkins,already relied on Tesla coils in their research laboratories. And a whole seriesof other original inventions had been patented, many of them before 1900, by theman of whom Ames could write “no discovery bears his name.”But it was also true that Tesla was more often an originator of broad conceptsthan of discrete innovations. His lectures radiated ideas that many others tookin hand, applied practically and subsequently patented. Indeed, this was one ofthe reasons why he was now beginning to play his cards so much closer to hischest.If at the same time he seemed to sensationalize his new projects and theories,it was because, acting as his own entrepreneur, seeking financial backing frominvestors and the wealthy, he resorted to methods that would appeal to them. Theshows staged in his laboratories were intended to dazzle the money people who,he realized, would not be technically able to “steal” his ideas. Fellowscientists, jealous but not deceived, were naturally unhappy.Despite the fact that his cornucopia of ideas flowed almost as richly as ever,he had reached an age when he could no longer ignore his own mortality. Friendsand acquaintances began to fall away. Mark Twain died in 1910, and the lossaffected Tesla deeply. Three years later Morgan also died, as great a pivotalfigure in national affairs as he had been in Tesla’s own career.Tesla’s psyche had always been a festival of neuroses, but now his behaviorseemed to become, if anything, stranger still. No one knew when the inventorbegan gathering up the sick and wounded pigeons and carrying them back to hishotel. Usually, however, it was a mission that he carried out late in the day.His whole routine was that of a night person. It was also that of a prince ofthe blood. To hotel servants he could be cavalier and cutting one moment,generously rewarding with tips the next.As a night person he arrived at his office promptly at noon; as a prince of theblood he required that Miss Arbus or Miss Skerritt be standing just inside thedoor to take his hat, cane, and gloves. Then all window shades would be drawn tosimulate the darkness in which he worked most productively. In fact, the onlytime when the shades were raised was when a lightning storm was flashing overthe rooftops of the city. Then he would lie upon a black mohair couch to watchthe northern or the western sky. His employees said that he had always talked tohimself, but that during these lightning storms, when he insisted on beingalone, they could hear him through the door and that he became positivelyeloquent.But despite all the stresses and anomalous symptoms, Tesla’s creative geniusremained unimpaired. In 1906, the year of his fiftieth birthday, in the wake ofmany trials, he built the first model of his marvelous turbine. Possibly it hadbeen inspired by his childhood efforts to build a vacuum motor and by his plans,during the year he spent living in the mountains, for shooting mail through atube beneath the ocean. Possibly the idea for the bladeless turbine went backeven further—to his earliest memory of invention, when he had built a tinywaterwheel that had no blades but spun all the same.Whatever its provenance, the model weighed less than ten pounds and developedthirty horsepower. He later built much larger ones that developed 200horsepower. “What I have done,” Tesla explained, “is to discard entirely theidea that there must be a solid wall in front of the steam and to apply in apractical way, for the first time, two properties which every physicist knows tobe common to all fluids but which have not been utilized. These are adhesion andviscosity.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos945697]Julius C. Czito, the son of Tesla’s long-time machinist Kolman Czito, builtseveral versions of the turbine in his machine shop at Astoria, Long Island. Therotor of the so-called “derby hat powerhouse” consisted of a stack of very thindisks of German silver, mounted on the center of a shaft. They were enclosed ina casing provided with ports. “When deriving energy from any kind of fluid,”Tesla elaborated, “it is admitted at the periphery and escapes at the center;when, on the contrary, the fluid is to be energized, it enters in the center andis expelled at the periphery. In either case it traverses the intersticesbetween the disks in a spiral path, power being derived from or imparted to it,by purely molecular action. In this novel manner the heat energy of steam orexplosive mixtures can be transformed with high economy….”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos946358]He saw no limits to its uses. With gasoline fuel it could power automobiles andairplanes. It could drive ocean liners across the Atlantic in three days. Itcould be used for trains, trucks, refrigeration, hydraulic gearing (motiontransfer), agriculture, irrigation, and mining—and it would run on steam as wellas gasoline. He was even designing a futuristic automobile that he planned topower with it. Above all, he believed that the turbine would be inexpensive tomanufacture compared to traditional models.His spirits were greatly bolstered when the Tesla turbine began to be widelyacclaimed—in concept. Even the War Department officers declared it to be“something new in the world,” and said they were “greatly impressed with it.” Itseemed reasonable to expect that a fortune was to be made by the man who haddesigned a better rotary engine.Tesla began to emerge from the endless trauma of humiliation and debt. Thescalding nightmares were occurring less often in which the death of his brotherDaniel so long ago, his mother’s death, and the destruction of Wardenclyffeseemed all mixed up. All he needed now was capital, and the turbine would puthim back on top. He began ticking off in his mind the names of possibleinvestors."},{"pageContent":"19. THE NOBEL AFFAIR The many mourners who crowded into the funeral for J. Pierpont Morgan at St.George’s Church in Manhattan on April 14, 1913, were attending a theatricalclosing, the end of a long run of history. Tesla had been sent tickets for thegallery, with apologies that better seats were not available.After the rites the inventor thoughtfully set his calendar ahead exactly onemonth. On May 14 he asked for an appointment with J. P. Morgan, the scion of theHouse of Morgan.The younger banker and the inventor met and talked mainly about the commercialpotential of the Tesla turbine. Six days later the inventor received a loan of$15,000 from the J. P. Morgan Company with interest at 6 percent, for ninemonths.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos946671]Tesla followed up their meeting with a letter describing in forceful and fluentwords the uniqueness of his latest invention. “Knowing this as I do,” he wrote,“not merely as an expert but as a seer, you may judge how anxious I am, for thesake of the world, to connect myself with men of your integrity and power….”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos946876]Unfortunately he did not stop there. He could not refrain from reminding Morganjunior that Morgan senior had lent him $ 150,000 for Wardenclyffe. Others hadlet him down in this venture, he said; otherwise the first world broadcastingsystem would by then have been flourishing. Accordingly, he proposed theformation of two new companies, one for the development of radio broadcastingand the other for turbine manufacture, offering “to turn over to you my entireinterest in both,” leaving it to Morgan to accord to him such a part as he mightchoose.The younger Morgan replied stiffly that he could not possibly consent to Tesla’sturning over an interest in the two companies. Instead, he suggested that Teslago ahead and organize the two firms and, from his profits, start repaying the$150,000 to the Morgan estate as and when he could. This did not end thedialogue, but it certainly crimped it.Over the next several years the inventor favored J. P. Morgan with repeatedinvitations to invest in a wireless station and the turbine. But the financierneither understood nor was much interested in fluid propulsion or radio. As forthe wireless transmission of electrical power, the old objection still obtained:Why would Morgan want to put all his power lines out of business? Nevertheless,the financier lent Tesla $5,000 and then, like his father, took refuge in aEuropean vacation. He sailed that autumn, carrying some books the inventor hadgiven him, and leaving Tesla pacing the dock.Meanwhile Tesla began licensing his turbine in Europe. Through the intercessionof the former Prince Albert of the Belgians, he received $10,000 for the licensein Belgium. A concession in Italy was expected to bring him $20,000. In Americahe concluded automobile and train lighting contracts and was working on otherpractical arrangements. But still his funds were far short of his needs.He struggled to take the disappointments philosophically and had a remarkablyaccurate idea of his own place in—or rather, out of—time.“We are but cogwheels in the medium of the universe,” he wrote to Morgan, “andit is… an unavoidable consequence of the laws governing that the pioneer who isfar in advance of his age is not understood and must suffer pain anddisappointment and be content with the higher reward which is accorded to him byposterity.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos947073]When Morgan returned just before Christmas, Tesla presented him with a number ofpropositions. He was again desperate. “I am almost despairing at the presentstate of things. I need money badly and I cannot get it in these dreadful times.You are about the only man to whom I can look for help. . . .” He closed bywishing the multimillionaire a Happy Christmas. Morgan responded with a bill forinterest of $684.17 on the two loans already extended and a hearty return ofseasonal wishes.In January 1914, despite the threatening World War, Tesla pleaded with Morganthat he needed another $5,000 to finish and ship a turbine to the GermanMinister of Marine, High Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. He felt that no question ofloyalty was involved since he had already offered the turbine to the U.S.government. Despite complimentary remarks about his invention from some in theWar Department, no orders had been placed at home. This time Morgan relented andextended another loan.Two months later he offered Morgan a chance to finance an automobile speedometerand to buy a two-thirds interest in a new company. It was becoming painfullyapparent that there were problems with the turbine: the metal had not beenmanufactured that could take such high speeds for long; and it was by no meansinexpensive, at least in the early stages of development. More time was neededand therefore, he must develop interim sources of capital.But this time Morgan’s secretary returned all the enclosures and advised thatMr. Morgan could not possibly be interested in any further inventions.Through the next winter, however, Tesla continued to appeal to Morgan again andagain. “Please do not take this as another cry for help,” he wrote; but inreality it was a desperate cry. Meantime, he moved his offices from the smartMetropolitan Towers to the less expensive Woolworth Building. In November Morganreplied that he would extend the loans but would add nothing more to them.Everyone seemed to be hard up. Scherff sent the inventor two new notes of hisown for signature, replacing the old unpaid ones, so that the former employeemight be able to use them as collateral. He expressed disappointment that Teslahad been unable to make at least some payment; but Tesla, signing the new notes,wrote glowingly of his prospects for the turbine.In the midst of personal trials he still found time to help his friends.Johnson, who had been promoted to editor of Century magazine four years earlier,wrote urging secrecy in an office scandal that jeopardized his position. Hereferred to a letter from a Mr. Anthony “written without any knowledge of thesituation at the office. What he will say when I tell him the new situation, theLord knows….”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos947271]Tesla, having interceded in the mysterious affair, wrote back that he had doneall he could to dispose of the matter, “but I have encountered resistance and sofear I have reached no tangible results… I am not relaxing my efforts. Trustingthat you will not let this little embarrassment weigh too heavily on yourmind….”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos947475]*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_064.html#filepos1166907]But the little embarrassment—the nature of which remained a closely guardedsecret—resulted in Johnson’s resignation. Things were never quite the same attheir fashionable home on Lexington Avenue after that. Although in time Robertobtained a new position as permanent secretary of the American Academy of Artsand Letters, his finances seem to have undergone some sort of erosion. TheJohnsons continued to indulge themselves with the parties, the servants, and theEuropean holidays to which they were accustomed, but now their lifestyle wasbringing them into debt. A pattern began that would continue for the remainderof both men’s lives, of borrowing small sums of money from each other to coveroverdrafts. More often, surprisingly, it was to be Tesla who bailed out Johnson.War with Germany was drawing ever closer for the United States. Tesla and youngJohn Hays Hammond, Jr., on the latter’s initiative, corresponded at length onpossible ways of earning money through military applications of their work inrobotry. Hammond, using Tesla’s principles, had built an electric dog on wheelsthat followed him everywhere, its motor operated by a light beam behind itseyes. Bowser was not exactly an invention to set the generals and admiralsfiercely bidding against one another, but Hammond had also operated a crewlessyacht by radio in Boston harbor, and the two inventors toyed with the idea offorming a teleautomatics company. Hammond had an automatic selective system hewanted to develop, and Tesla thought that a dirigible torpedo he had inventedmany years earlier could be of service to the War Department. But although hehelped Hammond get a technical article published on the state of the art, theirefforts at joint development were not pursued.6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos947676]Even at this stage in his career Tesla was still often handicapped by publicconfusion about his citizenship. A Washington Post article, making a commonerror, referred to him as the “noted Balkan scientist.” And among thebureaucrats in Washington he may have suffered from a mistaken application ofthe NIH (not invented here) factor. Mere superiority of product would seldom beenough to override such a disadvantage, however much society might be the loser.But no doubt much more damaging to Tesla’s prospects at this time were thosetraditional enemies of innovation—inertia and vested interest. An industrialconsultant tells of inquiring some years ago of an executive in the Office ofNaval Research in Washington, D.C., if they had ever sponsored R&D programs onthe Tesla turbine. The reply was: “We get proposals all the time for fundingTesla turbine work. But let’s be candid. The Parsons turbine has been around along time with entire industries built around it and supporting it. If the Teslaturbine isn’t an order of magnitude superior, then it would be pouring moneydown the rat hole because the existing industry isn’t going to be overturnedthat easily….”Sometimes Tesla’s inventions had better luck backing into America from abroad.In 1915 a German firm, licensed to use his wireless patents, built a radiostation for the U.S. Naval Radio Service on Mystic Island near Tuckerton, NewJersey. It was equipped with the famous Goldschmidt high-frequency alternator ofthe magnetic reflecting type, which enabled radio frequency alternating currentsto be developed directly.7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos947978] Teslareceived royalties of around $1,000 per month from these patents for two years—amost welcome source of income.When the chief engineer, Emil Mayer, told him that messages from the stationwere being received at a distance of 9,000 miles, he took the news calmly, forit merely confirmed what he already knew. “You have thus proved, practically,what I demonstrated with my wireless plant in scientific experiments carried onfrom 1899 to 1900,” he replied. Unfortunately the war soon brought his radioroyalties to a halt. The Tuckerton Radio Station was closed by the government in1917, the year of America’s entry into the war. Tesla did, however, receiveroyalties later from the Atlantic Communications Companies.World War I was brought home to America’s Serbian population long before itengaged the country at large. Local Slavs could not help but feel the impactsince Serbia had led the movement for Pan-Slav unification that ultimately setoff the whole conflagration. A Serbian nationalist assassinated the ArchdukeFrancis Ferdinand at Sarajevo in Bosnia, leading to both Serbia and Montenegrobeing overrun by the Central Powers, composed, among others, of Austria andGermany. Soon news of the extreme sufferings of the Serbian people reached theUnited States.Relief efforts were begun by local emigrants under the auspices of the SerbianOrthodox Church and the Serbian Red Cross, of which Pupin was chairman. Furtherproof of the antipathy between the two scientists is supplied by an anecdotefrom this period. The very Rev. Peter O. Stijacić with a noted professor oftheology from Serbia called upon Tesla one day to solicit a message of unity toAmerican Serbs, in hope of inspiring them to send more generous aid to thehomeland. Innocently they suggested that such an appeal be signed by the famousNikola Tesla, Michael Pupin, and Tesla’s dear friend, Dr. Paul Radosavljević(known as Dr. Rado), who taught at New York University. Tesla politely askedthat they excuse him as a signer, knowing the impossibility of ever agreeingwith Pupin on a word or a phrase, let alone a message of unity. And if theunification committee itself could not get together, . . . American Serbs, hesaid philosophically, but with amusement in his eyes, had minds of their own.In 1918 a kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was proclaimed under the ruleof King Peter I. But this by no means ended Slavic turmoil and misery. Elevenyears later King Peter’s successor, Alexander I, following a move towardseparatism by Croatia, established a dictatorship. At least the country thenacquired one name for all its people and its parts—Yugoslavia. Tesla approvedboth of Alexander and of unity.Another anecdote about the inventor is told by the Reverend Stijacić. On hisfirst trip to America as a young writer for the Serbian Federation, Stijacić hadbeen surprised to find in the Chicago Public Library, a book of poems, theauthor of which was the popular Serbian poet Zmaj-Jovan. The translator wasNikola Tesla. Later, when Stijacić was taken by Dr. Rado to meet the inventor inhis offices on the twentieth floor of the Metropolitan Tower, he said, “Mr.Tesla, I did not know that you were interested in poetry.”A look of wry amusement shone in the inventor’s eyes. “There are many of usSerbs who sing,” he said, “but there is nobody to listen to us.”The New York Times on November 6, 1915, carried a story on page one, based upona Reuter’s dispatch from London, reporting that Tesla and Edison were to sharethe Nobel Prize in physics. Interviewed the next day, Tesla told a Timesreporter he had received no official notification of the award. But hespeculated that it might be for his discovery of a way to transmit energywithout wires. This, he said, had proved to be practical not only overterrestrial distances but “even effects of cosmic magnitude may be created.”He then described for the reporter a future when all wars would be waged withelectrical waves instead of explosives. More positively, he said, “We canilluminate the sky and deprive the ocean of its terrors! We can draw unlimitedquantities of water from the ocean for irrigation! We can fertilize the soil anddraw energy from the sun!”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos948296]Asked what he thought Edison was being honored for, Tesla tactfully replied thatEdison was worthy of a dozen Nobel prizes. That gentleman, reached in Omaha onhis way home from the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco, seemedsurprised when shown the London dispatch. He too said he had received noofficial notice. He made no further comment.Robert and Katharine were unsurprised but delighted by the news. The formerquickly sent his congratulations. Tesla, his mood now more thoughtful, repliedthat many people would win the Nobel Prize, but that “I have not less than fourdozen of my creations identified with my name in technical literature. These arehonors real and permanent, which are bestowed, not by a few who are apt to err,but by the whole world which seldom makes a mistake, and for any of these Iwould give all the Nobel prizes during the next thousand years.”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos948588]What followed was a curious business. The western press, including leadingmagazines, picked up the story and without checking, gave it wide circulation.In another story in the Times, Tesla was interviewed again as a Nobel winner.His comments to the inquiring reporter were entirely typical. He bemoaned thefact that the world, after so many years, still did not understand his conceptsof voice transmission. With such a plant as Wardenclyffe, he explained, thetelephone exchange of New York City could hook up, enabling subscribers to speakto anyone in the world without any change in the telephonic apparatus. A picturefrom the European battlefields could be transmitted to New York in five minutes.The current passed through the earth, he elaborated, starting from thetransmission station with infinite speed from that region and, slowing down tothe speed of light at a distance of 6,000 miles, then increasing in speed fromthat region and reaching the receiving station with infinite velocity.“It’s a wonderful thing. Wireless is coming to mankind in its full meaning likea hurricane, some of these days. Some day there will be, say, six great wirelesstelephone stations in the world system connecting all the inhabitants of thisearth to one another not only by voice but by sight.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos948758]Flawed though his physics might be (Tesla would resist to the end the idea thatlight sped faster than anything) his prophecy was sound enough. He did notexplicitly foresee today’s microwave-boosting synchronous satellites fortelevision, yet something of the sort had been in his mind since, as a teenager,he had envisioned building a ring around the equator that would revolve in Earthsynchrony.And if he did not invent television, he at least imagined it. Four years laterJohnson suggested that as a money-making venture, Tesla invent a way ofreproducing football games on a home screen as they occurred. “I am alreadyexpecting to become a multimillionaire without going into show business,” hereplied, but went on to offer his “best suggestion,” which was to employ “nineflying machines, winged and propellerless five hundred miles or more, takenegatives, develop films, and reel them off as they arrive. . . . It calls foran invention to which I have devoted twenty years of careful study, which I hopewill ultimately realize, that is television, making possible to see at distancethrough a wire….”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos948924] But, infact, he never pursued this idea.The report of the Nobel Prize in physics for 1915, to be jointly shared byEdison and Tesla, was carried in the Literary Digest12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos949132] and TheElectrical World of New York,13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos949351] bothpublications having gone to press before November 14, the date on which anotherReuter’s dispatch, this time from Stockholm, dropped a devastating bombshell.The Nobel Committee announced that the prize for physics would in fact be sharedby Professor William Henry Bragg of the University of Leeds, England, and hisson, W. L. Bragg of Cambridge University, for their use of X rays to determinethe structure of crystals.What had happened? The Nobel Prize Foundation declined to clarify. Onebiographer and close friend of Tesla’s reported years later that theSerbo-American had declined the honor, stating that as a discoverer he could notshare the prize with a mere inventor.14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos949550] Yetanother biographer advanced the theory that it was Edison who objected tosharing the prize, that it was in keeping with his “sardonic and sadistic brandof humor” to have deprived Tesla of $20,000 when he knew how much he neededfunds.15[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos949712]But no real evidence exists to prove that either of them declined the Nobel. TheNobel Foundation said simply, “Any rumor that a person has not been given aNobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the award isridiculous.” The recipient would have nothing to say in the matter, except todecline it after the fact if he or she so chose. But the Foundation did not denythat Tesla and Edison had been first choices.Edison’s fame and wealth were secure; he had little need of such an honor. Butfor Tesla it must have been one more cruel disappointment. And certainly it wasnot the kind of publicity he needed at this critical time."},{"pageContent":"20. FLYING STOVE The teething troubles that beset the development of the new turbine weresubstantial. Elated with the initial success of his small turbine models, Teslahad designed a large double turbine to test with steam at the Waterside Stationin New York. This was Edison country, peopled with engineers of the New YorkEdison Company, and predictably there were problems almost from the start.Tesla’s habit of arriving at the station sprucely attired at 5 P.M. andinsisting that the workers stay for overtime caused no pleasure. There wasn’tenough money to test the turbine properly, even on a straight schedule. Theengineers, failing to understand it, reported it a misconception. And so on.More important, there was a severe practical problem. At the tremendously highspeeds at which the turbine operated, averaging 35,000 revolutions per minute,the centrifugal force was so great that it stretched the metal in the rotatingdisks. It was to be many years before metallurgy would produce the superiormetals required.He finally persuaded the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company in Milwaukee tobuild three turbines, but again he was most undiplomatic with both engineeringstaff and management, and communicated his dissatisfaction to the board ofdirectors. He walked out on tests after learning of a negative report by theengineers, claiming they would not build it as he wished. They said he refusedto supply enough information.When the manager of Westinghouse’s railway and lighting division wrote askingfor details on the turbine, Tesla replied confidently that it was superior toanything in the competition in terms of extreme lightness and high performance.Indeed, he said, he was planning to use it in a boxlike flivver airplane.“You should not be at all surprised,” he wrote, “if some day you see me fly fromNew York to Colorado Springs in a contrivance which will resemble a gas stoveand weigh as much.”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos950031] (Theplane would weigh only eight hundred pounds and could if necessary enter anddepart through a window.)This vision, however captivating, failed to bring Westinghouse orders.Accordingly, in his efforts to continue development of the turbine, he took the,for him, unusual step of working directly for two companies—the Pyle NationalCompany and the E. G. Budd Manufacturing Company.With the turbine he had invented a valvular conduit that enabled it to be usedwith combustible fuel. This unique conduit, with no moving parts, has recentlybeen used in fluid logic elements, in which context it is referred to as a fluiddiode.2 [../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos950236]Tesla’s 1916 patent of his valvular conduit,*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_065.html#filepos1167545] whichclosely followed Fleming’s vacuum diode, is one of the cornerstones of themodern science of fluidics. But once again, he would manage to profit verylittle by his discovery.Today the Tesla turbine is at last beginning to get some of the attention it haslong deserved. One of the country’s leading research experts on it is Professorof Engineering Warren Rice of Arizona State University who, however, hasconfined his work to the fluid mechanics of the flow processes that occurbetween the disks.3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos950494]In 1972 Walter Baumgartner built an experimental model of the Tesla turbineengine that ran on compressed air aided by steam injection, and produced some 30horsepower, at 18,000 rpm.In the 1980s the unique turbine is under active development for vehicular andpower-plant use by SunWind, Ltd., of Sebastopol, California. SunWind, Ltd.,plans to use a modified version of the Tesla turbine, burning hydrogen as theoptimal fuel, in a three-wheel car called the Rainbow. The turbine will alsoburn propane, vegehol, and gasoline.SunWind president Mark Goldis states that researcher Peter Myers has built anexperimental model of the turbine which verifies that it performs as Teslapredicted it would. He is now working on incorporating a proprietary combustionchamber to bring it up to the needs of contemporary designs and taking intoaccount modern metallurgy.“We are convinced that the improved Myers vortex turbine, based on Tesla’sinvention, will work better than any now in use, and that it will operate at 60percent efficiency,” Goldis says. Efficiency of most other turbines is about 40percent. He believes that most earlier experimenters failed in their efforts tobuild Tesla’s turbine because they did not understand laminar flow as opposed toturbulent flow. The turbine, says Goldis, is inexpensive and easily machined.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos950989]Another California firm, General Enertech of San Diego, is building and sellingthe Tesla turbine as a pump. This too has been improved and modernized.Alas, future vindication does not pay current bills. Tesla was having a hardstruggle to meet the costs of day-to-day operation and to keep his credit forentertaining at Delmonico’s. It came as a trifling blow, a social anticlimax,when for the second time he was dropped for nonpayment of dues by the Players’Club. With both Mark Twain and Stanford White gone, his pleasure in going to theold haunt had diminished.Still, his name continued to appear regularly in the press, headlines neverceasing to proclaim the originality of his imagination. His ideas had news valueeven when substance was lacking. “Tesla’s Tidal Wave to Make War Impossible,”declared the English Mechanic & World of Science, disclosing his idea for theuse of explosives to create destructive ocean waves upon demand. Little more wasever heard of this brainchild.In a letter to the Times under the heading “Nicola [sic] Tesla Objects,” the newvulnerable and touchy Tesla issued a generalized complaint to the effect that hethought he should receive credit for his own inventions. Shortly afterward thesour-grapes attitude that his friends had marked with sadness was betrayed againon the editorial page of the Times in parallel columns—one a letter from Tesla,the other a story about the hero of the hour, Orville Wright.Wright was being interviewed in a flat meadow near Washington, D.C., as heprepared to take up his plane, which he had now flown many times, on a testflight. This threatened to be a special occasion, however, for word had beenbrought to Wright that President Teddy Roosevelt was standing by in the WhiteHouse, hoping to be invited to accompany him as the nation’s first FlyingPresident.Wright may be forgiven a certain nervousness at the thought of having for apassenger the toothy president, bundled from head to toe in high boots,leggings, helmet, goggles, and white silk scarf. It was a proper dilemma, as theTimes report hinted. The flyer had wanted no part of such responsibility,knowing how genuinely risky the test could be. Yet it also seemed risky to haveto say no.A crowd of thousands had gathered on the crude flight strip awaiting the flyer’sdecision. Wright had spent as much time as was decently possible tinkering withthe motor. At last the pioneer aeronaut raised his wind gauge aloft and studiedit. The crowd held its collective breath. A slight zephyr fanned their brows.Wright lowered the gauge, shaking his head. “We cannot attempt a flight,” hesaid gravely.One column over, Tesla made clear his contempt for such a state of aeronautics.All his life he had been working on designs and engines for advanced high-speedplanes, but thus far he had filed no patents. But he did not think much of whatthe competition had been doing and was at his most irritatingly superior:“Place any of the later aeroplanes beside that of Langley, their prototype,” hewrote, “and you will not find as much as one decided improvement. There are thesame old propellers, the same old inclined planes, rudders, and vanes—not asingle notable difference. . . . Half a dozen aeronauts have been in turn hailedas conquerors and kings of the air. It would have been much more appropriate togreet John D. Rockefeller as such. But for the abundant supply of high-gradefuel we would still have to wait for an engine capable of supporting not onlyitself but several times its own weight against gravity.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos951185]The Langley plane, he said, was doomed if it encountered a downdraft, and thehelicopter was in this respect much preferable, although objectionable for otherreasons.The really successful heavier-than-air craft would be based on radically newprinciples, he predicted, and would soon materialize. “[W]hen it does it willgive an impetus to manufacture and commerce such as was never witnessed before,provided only that Governments do not resort to methods of the SpanishInquisition, which have only proved so disastrous to the wireless art, the idealmeans for making man absolute master of the air.”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos951470]Although such letters throbbed with the injuries done to him and only createdmore resentment toward him, his prophecy was, as usual, accurate. Honored at adinner at the Waldorf with Rear Admiral Charles Sigsbee, he described the“aerial warships” that were coming and once more predicted a wireless telephonethat would encircle the globe.The patents on his brilliantly designed flivver airplane or flying stove—intoday’s technical literature the descendants of this craft (not to be confusedwith simple helicopters) are called vertical takeoff and landing aircraft(VTOL)—would not be filed until 1921 and 1927 and finally granted in 1928.7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos951643] This isbelieved to be the only invention patented by Tesla of which, probably for lackof developmental capital, he built no prototype. The year the patents wereissued the inventor would have been seventy-two years of age.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_066.html#filepos1167975]The tiny plane, which he thought should sell for less than $1,000, rose straightinto the air with its helicopter-type lifting propeller. The pilot touched atilting device that pitched the craft forward, placing the propeller in front,airplane-style. The pilot’s seat swivelled to remain upright while he moved thewings into a horizontal position. Tesla’s light but powerful turbine was tothrust the plane forward at great speed. It could land by reversing theprocess—on a space the size of a garage roof, a living room, or the deck of asmall boat.Tesla’s vertical-takeoff concept languished until nearly a decade after hisdeath. Then, in the early 1950s, both Convair and Lockheed tested vehicles that,although vastly more sophisticated in engineering, adhered faithfully to theTeslian fundamentals. The more successful of these craft, the Convair XFY-1“Pogo,” was a 14,000 pound single-seat Navy fighter powered by a 5850 hp AllisonT-40 turboprop engine. At rest, it sat on its tail, nose pointed skyward. Inaction, it took off vertically, then rotated 90 degrees to horizontal flight, inwhich it had a designed top speed in excess of 600 miles-per-hour at 15,000feet.Although tests of the “Pogo” were generally successful, the Navy decided not toput the plane into production. The Allison engine, Navy evaluators felt, wasinsufficiently powerful; the design of the pilot’s pivoting seat was inadequateto accommodate the radical changes of attitude required, and the tricky,essentially blind, landings were just too dangerous.But the potential military and commercial advantages of a full-scale aircraftthat could take off and land without benefit of extensive runways were too greatto be ignored. Following the intriguing tests of the Convair and Lockheedmachines, the international aerospace industry entered into a full-scale pursuitof the ideal VTOL design. Numerous ideas were tried, but by the beginning of the1980s the favored design was of an aircraft which did not itself change attitudeon landing and takeoff, but whose engines were modified so that the direction ofthrust could be rotated through 90 degrees. Two of the modern world’s leadingoperational fighter planes—the Anglo-American British Aerospace “Harrier” andthe Russian Yakovlev Yak-36—employ this principle.Plainly Tesla’s flivver-cum-flying stove was a far cry from today’ssophisticated, massively powerful VTOL’s. Indeed, conceived as it was decadesbefore the advent of the jet engine, the flying stove could hardly have beenotherwise. But as the Convair and Lockheed experiments of the 1950s suggest, theTeslian concept was an almost inevitable first step in true VTOL research. ThatTesla should have hit upon this idea at a time when the enterprise of aviationwas in its infancy is astonishing enough, but if we can credit the Yugoslavmagazine Review, Tesla’s VTOL concept may even have anticipated the advent ofpowered flight. According to this generally respected publication, there isinformation in the Tesla papers in Belgrade indicating that Tesla’s first VTOLdrawings, along with plans for rocket motors, were destroyed in the laboratoryfire of 1895!8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos951929]The Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade contains, in addition to drawings of theaircraft, plans for an “aeromobile,” a jet-propelled automobile with fourwheels, apparently designed for flying or for terra firma. His papers, accordingto museum officials, include “calculations for horsepower, fuel and otheraspects, all of which lost their true value when Tesla passed away.” Inaddition, they report that he left sketches of interplanetary ships. Thisinformation, however, has not been made available to western scholars.In more down-to-Earth moments, Tesla designed specially mounted lightning rodsand air conditioning systems, and wrote proposals for manufacturersdemonstrating that his turbine could be operated on the waste gases from steelmills and factories. He never saw smoke escaping from a stack when he was notoffended by the waste of uncombusted fuel that used up finite resources.While his imagination continued to soar with the future, the circumstances ofhis present became drearier by the day. A rare quarrel over money occurredbetween the inventor and Scherff, but was soon forgiven. Scherff wrote thatcreditors were “hounding me hard,” and that the illness of his wife had put himin debt. He hoped Tesla would make some payment on his loans.The inventor loftily responded, “Please do not give way to bitterness. You knowthat the experiences you have had were unusual and that while they have notbenefitted you materially to a great extent, they have been the means ofdeveloping the good that is in you. . . .”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos952183] WhenScherff proved more insistent than usual, he sent a small amount of money andagain took a superior stance in the matter: “I am sorry to note that you arelosing your equanimity and poise. . . . You must pull yourself together andbanish the evil spirits….”To further bolster the morale of his former employee and loyal friend, hereported that the development of his steam and gas turbines and of a blower hadbeen almost completed and that they held revolutionary promise. “I am now atwork,” he wrote, “on new designs of automobile, locomotive, and lathe in whichthese new inventions of mine are embodied and which cannot help but prove acolossal success. The only trouble is where and when to get the cash, but itcannot last very long before my money will come in a torrent, and then you cancall on me for anything you like.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos952375]On another occasion the much-tried Scherff pointedly wrote to say he was glad tohear a Tesla therapeutic device would soon be on the market because he himselfcould use one. Rather late in life, he bought a modest home at Westchester,Connecticut, and meeting his mortgage payments became a recurring subject withrespect to Tesla’s outstanding notes.Although the “torrent” of money never came, Tesla did manage to find occasionalmajor investors. Thus the Tesla Ozone Company was incorporated in 1910, with acapital of $400,000, to develop a process with several commercial uses, amongthem refrigeration. Later, the Tesla Propulsion Company was capitalized atAlbany, New York, for $1 million by the inventor with Joseph Hoadley and WalterH. Knight, its purpose being to build turbines for ships and for the AlabamaConsolidated Coal & Iron Company.To add to his other problems, Tesla had trouble with his former employee, FritzLowenstein, in this period. Ever since the days of his secret research inColorado, the inventor had worried about Lowenstein’s loyalty. He was reassuredwhen the German engineer returned to work for him at Wardenclyffe, but within afew years this relationship was terminated for financial reasons. Lowensteinwent on to become a successful inventor of radio devices.In 1916 he was called as a key witness for the defendants in the case of theMarconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America v. Kilbourne and Clark, havingagreed to testify that in his opinion the Tesla radio patents held sway over theMarconi patents. At the last moment, however, Lowenstein switched sides andtestified for Marconi. Many questions were raised about his veracity, andcharges were made but nothing was ever proved. As a result of this, however, heincurred Tesla’s lasting enmity. It appeared that in the period 1910 to 1915Tesla had lent substantial sums of money to the German radio engineer. Threeyears later Tesla brought suit against him, but did not go to trial.11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos952560]Anne Morgan, now famous in her own right, reappeared in his life tangentiallyafter her father’s death. Tesla had written to her of his deep admiration forthe elder Morgan, which had outlasted his disappointments over money: “All theworld knew him as a genius of rare powers, but to me he appears as one of thecolossal figures of the ages… which mark epochs in the evolution of humanthought and endeavor….”12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos952801]Like Tesla’s turbine, Anne had become a powerhouse, her life crowded withhumanitarian activities in education, children’s affairs, women’s workingconditions, and immigrant welfare—not to mention fashion and the servantproblems of the wealthy. Fresh from the pleasures of touring Europe, she wouldturn up in Women’s Night Court in Manhattan to befriend a wayward girl. An earlyFrances Perkins– without-portfolio, she traveled about America, speaking beforewomen’s clubs in behalf of her causes, which now included a vacation savingsfund for working women. She conferred with judges about the problems ofhomeless, exploited young women, which were real and appalling, and sometimesshe ranged as far as Topeka, Kansas, where Governor W. R. Stubbs once admiringlydescribed her as an “insurgent.”Although she had all but forgotten her youthful infatuation with Tesla, theykept in touch. “I have hopes to see you this winter,” she wrote, “and am indeedsorry that a whole year has passed since we last met. Have the months done muchfor you in your work, and do you now, at last, feel you are advancing… ?”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos953005]Tesla, glad for the opportunity to renew their friendship, bragged a little:“The progress since our last pleasant meeting was steady and most gratifying. Myideas come in an uninterrupted stream as ever before. I see them grow anddevelop and am achieving happiness and, in a degree, success in the worldlysense.” He praised her own “noble work” and sent warm regards to Mrs. Morgan.14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos953206]The Triangle Factory Fire of March 25, 1911, in which 145 shirtwaist workers,most of them young immigrant women, leaped to their death from a New Yorkhigh-rise sweatshop, caused an outpouring of anger that led to more rapidunionization and ultimately to widespread reform of working conditions. Manyadditional workers had been injured in this fire, which resulted from a flagrantdisregard for safety regulations. From this pivotal catastrophe much that Annehad worked for as a young woman was materializing.She was seen marching with strikers and had become a writer of formidableletters in behalf of her causes. In her tailored suits she was what journalistsdescribed as “full-figured,” a chainsmoker, fast talker, and much sought afteras a fund raiser. It was said that her energetic presence “charged theatmosphere like an electrical disturbance.”One biographer has speculated that Anne’s androgenic characteristics and Tesla’sputative asexuality might have formed the basis of their friendship.Undoubtedly, however, money and social position formed a stronger magnetism.In view of the many pleas for capital that Tesla made to her father and brotherover the years, there is a certain turnabout humor in the fact that Anne did notscruple to tap him for her causes and that she appealed shrewdly to hissnobbishness in doing so. In a long letter to Tesla while a fund raiser for theWomen’s Department of the National Civic Federation, she grouped her subjectsunder such headings as “Almshouses” and “Citizenship,” reporting indignantlythat the proponents of compulsory State Old Age Pensions had declared thealmshouse “a relic of barbarism, a useless evil.” No flaming liberal despite hersupport of the downtrodden, she believed that the government must save andimprove the almshouses. In sly conclusion she asked, “Will you be one of thirtyto contribute $100 towards the amount still needed this year? . . .”15[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos953407] Thereis no record that Tesla responded. He often had trouble paying his hotel rent.In his desk lay another letter unanswered from Katharine Johnson: “Sometimes Ihope you will make me tell you what I know about thought transference,” shewrote. “One would need to feel herself en rapport to speak of such things. Ihave had such a wonderful experience the past three years, so much of it isalready dim, that I sometimes fear it will all pass away with me and you of allpersons ought to know something of it for you could not fail to have ascientific interest in it. I call it thought transference for want of a betterword. Perhaps it is not all that. I have often wished and meant to speak to youof this but when I am with you I never say the things I had intended to say, Iseem to be capable of only one thing. Do come tomorrow, Saturday.”16[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos953611]"},{"pageContent":"21. RADAR The humiliating news of Tesla’s financial distress following his loss ofWardenclyffe was further advertised in March 1916 when he was summoned to courtin New York for failure to pay $935 to the city in personal taxes.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos953956] Scherffhad lain awake nights worrying about his former employer and his taxes, and nowit had happened. Every local newspaper carried the story. The misfortune seemedunjustly cruel, coming at a time when Edison had just been appointed to animportant defense research post in Washington, while Marconi, Westinghouse,General Electric, and thousands of lesser firms were thriving on the profitsfrom Tesla’s patents.He was now forced to confess in court that he had lived for years on credit atthe Waldorf-Astoria, that he was penniless and swamped with debts. The land onwhich Wardenclyffe stood was taken from him and sold to a New York attorney, andit was even reported that the inventor might go to jail for contempt inconnection with his tax debts.Yet somehow in this time of turmoil and heartsickness he polished and publishedthe basic principles of what would be known—almost three decades later—as radar.German U-boats were sinking almost a million tons of Allied shipping a monthwhen America entered World War I in April 1917, and the search for a way todetect submarines was of the highest priority. But there was as yet no suchurgency about finding a means of predicting air attacks, although long-rangeGerman planes and Zeppelins had begun to raid central France and England withsome regularity. Although it was predictable that aerial bombardment wouldeventually become horribly destructive, it was not yet so; and anyway, the airwar was still thought to be romantic and dashing, bringing out a latentpropensity for heroism even among its victims.When German planes dropped the first bombs on Paris, Parisians stood in the openstreets to watch. When London was attacked from the air, Londoners trampledprimroses and hedgerows racing to the scene. An airship brought down in flameswas described by a newspaper as “beyond doubt the greatest free show that Londonhas ever enjoyed.”Even the bombing victims showed few signs of stress, said The Lancet, so uniqueand stimulating was the experience. In fact the English welcomed the chance toshow what the reporter described as “a fundamentally important factor, that ofrace, [which] is seen par excellence in the response of the crowd to stimuli ofthe character that we have become familiar with since the outbreak of the War. .. .” War made the English feel more English.In the circumstances, it is not surprising that when Tesla first began tospeculate about military applications of radar, it was with respect to locatingships and submarines rather than to detecting enemy bombers. Tesla had predictedthe general concept of radar in his sweeping article for Century magazine ofJune 1900: “Stationary waves . . . mean something more than telegraphy withoutwires to any distance. . . . For instance, by their use we may produce at will,from a sending station, an electrical effect in any particular region of theglobe; we may determine the relative position or course of a moving object, suchas a vessel at sea, the distance traversed by the same, or its speed….”In The Electrical Experimenter of August 1917 he described the main features ofmodern military radar: “If we can shoot out a concentrated ray comprising astream of minute electric charges vibrating electrically at tremendousfrequency, say millions of cycles per second, and then intercept this ray, afterit has been reflected by a submarine hull for example, and cause thisintercepted ray to illuminate a fluorescent screen (similar to the X-ray method)on the same or another ship, then our problem of locating the hidden submarinewill have been solved.“This electric ray would necessarily have to have an oscillation wave lengthextremely short and here is where the great problem presents itself, i.e., to beable to develop a sufficiently short wave length and a large amount of power….“The exploring ray could be flashed out intermittently and thus it would bepossible to hurl forth a very formidable beam of pulsating electric energy….”What he had described were the features of atmospheric pulsed radar that wouldfinally be practically developed in a crash program only months prior to thebeginning of World War II.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_067.html#filepos1168145] Teslaintended it to be used as underwater radar, however, which later provedimpracticable because of the great attenuation of electromagnetic waves inwater. Despite much recent research, no means have yet been found of propagatinglight, high-frequency radio beams, or radar through the ocean. But Tesla’sextra-low-frequency (ELF) waves will penetrate the seas and may serve adifferent purpose (see chapter 30), that of communication.†[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_068.html#filepos1168493]Even if Tesla’s radar could not be used to locate submerged objects, it wascurious that no one could then imagine any other use for it. At least as far asthe Navy was concerned, Edison may have had a hand in shunting radar aside. Nowa white-haired elder statesman of invention, he had been named to direct the newNaval Consulting Board in Washington, with the primary job of finding a way ofspotting U-boats. Tesla’s idea, if even brought to Edison’s attention, wouldalmost certainly have been discounted as mere dream stuff.In any event Edison had his hands full feuding with the Navy bureaucracy andcold-shouldering the “perfessers” who had begun clamoring for a piece of thatnew taste treat, the federal research pie. Edison’s own ideas were repeatedlychopped down by the Navy brass while he suffered frustration. As it turned out,the negative ramifications of his appointment were to prove more important tohistory than anything positive he was able to do in the post.At the time that Edison went to Washington, rumpled but rich, and Tesla remainedin New York, poor but dapper, both men were aware that a gap as broad as theHudson River was widening between them and the new generation of atomicphysicists. The latter could talk of nothing but Einstein. The new people werespecialists, although the splintering of minds was still in the infancy of itsglory. They joined the American Physics Society and believed little that failedto appear in their journal.Michael Pupin had gone to the trouble of carving out a section for engineers inthe National Academy of Sciences, which previously had refused to admit evenEdison. The line between practical men (engineers) and theoreticians(physicists) caused artificial distinctions to be drawn that were handicappingthe war effort. Those who were inventors, scientists, and engineers, like Pupinand Tesla, or chemists and inventors like Edison, were almost by definitionpassé.The new physics boiled with debates over waves versus particles and aboutEinstein’s special theory of relativity, which Tesla—with strong cosmic theoriesof his own—rejected outright. When Einstein’s general theory of relativity waspublished in 1916, even its creator had been unable to accept fully the dynamicuniverse that it implied. So disturbed was Einstein by this that he built intohis calculations a “fudge factor” that preserved the possibility that theuniverse might after all prove to be stable and unchanging. To Tesla this wasjust added proof that the relativists didn’t know what they were talking about.He himself was working on a theory of the universe to be disclosed in good time,and he had long ago propounded (but not published) his own dynamic theory ofgravity.He believed and had often stated, that atomic power would be 1. a dud, or 2.impossibly dangerous to control. In this he had illustrious company. Einsteintoo had grave doubts about it. As late as 1928 Dr. Millikan said, “There is nolikelihood man can ever tap the power of the atom. The glib supposition ofutilizing atomic energy when our coal has run out is a completely unscientificUtopian dream. . . .”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos954132] Andeven in 1933 England’s Lord Rutherford could say, “The energy produced by thebreaking down of the atom is a poor kind of thing. Anyone who expects a sourceof power from transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos954324]Perhaps it rankled Tesla to hear one of the “new physics” quips being attributedto Professor Sir William Bragg, co-winner of the 1915 Nobel Prize that for atime he had thought to be his. God runs electromagnetics on Monday, Wednesday,and Friday by the wave theory, said Bragg; and the devil runs it by quantumtheory on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.Tesla’s thoughts in later life were tending more and more toward a unifyingphysical theory. He believed that all matter came from a primary substance, theluminiferous ether, which filled all space, and he stoutly maintained thatcosmic rays and radio waves sometimes moved more swiftly than light.The younger scientists, most of whom were affiliated with universities, werejust beginning to perceive what a garden of earthly delightsgovernment-sponsored research could be. Oddly enough it was to be Edison,creator of the modern industrial research laboratory, who threw a spanner intotheir dreams.His first utterance as head of the Naval Consulting Board was that he did notthink “scientific research would be necessary to any great extent.” After all,he said, the Navy already had access to a vast “ocean of facts” in the Bureau ofStandards. What the Navy needed was practical men to produce the technology, nottheoreticians. And although the board was to have included civilian experts, hemade it clear that he wanted no physicists—although a mathematician or two mightbe of some use.The scientifically ambitious naval officers were as disconcerted as theuniversity scientists. What about submarine detectors? they wanted to know.Wouldn’t this take intensive research?Edison, unperturbed, said he thought the whole idea of a Navy researchlaboratory too exotic. But if the Navy insisted upon it, he believed it shouldknow how he handled things in his laboratories: “We have no system; we have norules, but we have a big scrap heap.” And inventors who circled around the scrapheap long enough usually came up with inventions. He did not mention that hisown staff routinely referred to his laboratory as “the dungyard.”This was enough to drive the university scientists to action. They formulated ascheme that began with bypassing the Navy and aiming straight for the top.Through the National Academy of Sciences they appealed to President Wilson. Theacademy, they argued compellingly, could provide “an arsenal of science” for thecountry.Soon the National Research Council, the ancestor of all subsequent researchagencies, the fountainhead of science grants, was quietly formed. The NRC was toinclude leading scientists and engineers from universities, industry, and thegovernment, with the goal of encouraging both basic and applied research. Thesecond unerring move of the professors—which also set a precedent—was toestablish headquarters in Washington, D.C., only blocks from the White House andCongressional purse strings.The value of a National Research Council to corporate America was obvious. Thegroup at once drew support from business and industry. A powerful pattern forthe future had been delineated, the incestuous triumvirate of government,industry, and academe that would shape every aspect of American life in thetwentieth century. And, ironically, it got started mainly as a tactic forcircumventing “the old curmudgeon.”The government at once assigned the NRC the job and funds for discovering a wayto detect marauding U-boats—the same job Edison’s board was already working on.An Allied mission was also formed, with French and American scientists bothracing to invent submarine-listening devices.Tesla, his description of the future radar officially ignored, could not bebothered with such petty concerns as listening devices. Guided missiles anddoomsday machines were more in his line. He gave The New York Times aprovocative peek at his latest patent applications for a new device “like thethunderbolts of Thor,” capable, he said, of destroying whole fleets of enemywarships, not to mention armies.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos954529] “Dr.Tesla insists there is nothing sensational about it,” reported the Times, “thatit is but the fruition of many years of work and study.”He described the device as a missile that would zoom through the air at 300miles per second, an unmanned craft with neither engine nor wings, sent byelectricity to drop explosives at any point on the globe. Tesla said he hadalready constructed a wireless transmitter sufficiently powerful to perform thisfeat, but that it was not yet the time to disclose the details of his guidedmissile.Nor had he given up on his scheme for creating fleets of robot warships. Justthe year before he had urged the government to “install along both of our oceancoasts, upon proper strategic and elevated points, numerous wireless controllingplants under the command of competent officers and that to each should beassigned a number of submarine, surface, and aerial craft. From the shorestations these vessels… could be perfectly controlled at any distance at whichthey remained visible through powerful telescopes. . . . If we were properlyequipped with such devices of defense it is inconceivable that any battleship orother vessel of an enemy ever could get within the zone of action of theseautomatic craft. . . .”Washington could not have been less interested. All ears, it seemed, were cuppedto the rather primitive listening devices being produced by NRC scientists,multiple-tube arrangements with electrical amplifiers designed for the hulls ofsubmarine-detecting craft. These worked to a certain degree. Much later, whensonar was developed, the basic principles would be closer to Tesla’s unsungconcept of radar, for it would detect the presence of subs, mines, and the likeby means of inaudible, high-frequency vibrations reflected back to the sendingdevice from the targets.By the war’s end Edison, like Tesla, was thoroughly disillusioned with what hedeemed the blindness and lack of creativity of the defense bureaucracy. Of themany projects that he had proposed, not one had been approved by the NavyDepartment.Long after World War I, and fifteen years after Tesla’s description of radar hadbeen published, both American and French teams were diligently working todevelop such a system according to his principles. Lawrence H. Hyland and LeoYoung, two young scientists in the Naval Research Laboratory, rediscovered thepotential application of high-frequency beams of short pulses of energy, thistime with both aircraft and surface shipping in mind.The military development of radar in America was to be impeded even further byinterservice secrecy, but in time both the Army and Navy developed crudelong-wave radar sets (one to two meters as opposed to microwaves). Meanwhile, in1934, a French team under Dr. Emil Girardeau built and installed radar on bothships and land stations, using “precisely apparatuses conceived according to theprinciples stated by Tesla,” says the Frenchman. “On the subject of Tesla’srecommendation concerning the very great strength of the impulses,” he added,“one must also recognize how right he was”; but the technology had beenunavailable and “the most difficult thing was to succeed in enormouslyincreasing the strength.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos954753]In America the first seagoing radar tests were made in 1937 on the USS Leary, anold destroyer of the Atlantic fleet and their success led to development of themodel XAF. A later model was in service on nineteen ships by 1941 and made anexcellent wartime record.Simultaneously an English team was struggling with this problem, for by nowHitler threatened England with invasion in World War II. The early pre-microwaveradar installations used by the British Home Chain had very large antennaetransmitting radio waves some 10 meters in length. Even so, these primitive setswere credited with winning air battles. Finally a sufficiently powerfulmagnetron was built which became the basis of all the generators established formodern radar starting with the 1940s.German scientists also developed a form of radar. It was thus an internationalachievement inspired by the mind of Tesla, although the English scientist RobertA. Watson-Watt was officially credited with the invention in 1935.The long race was won just in time to help save Britain from destruction by Nazibombers in the Battle of Britain. Radar became the basic defensive tool ofalmost every country in the world. After the war it was eagerly employed bycommercial airlines and shipping and would soon become essential to spaceexploration.Dr. Girardeau says that at the time Tesla was formulating his principles, “hewas prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carryingthem out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreamingcorrectly.”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos955032]At the time when his description of this invention appeared in print in 1917,Tesla was in Chicago. Broke but undefeated, he had again resolved to concentrateon developing his more practical inventions. Just before he left on this prosaicand arduous mission—painful for him, since it meant both dealing with engineersfor a long period of time and being away from his friends—he was asked by one ofhis oldest admirers, B. A. Behrend, to accept what any other engineer in Americawould have deemed a high honor—the Edison Medal of the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers.It was as if Behrend had opened one of those overhead hotel fire extinguishersand it had rained down vitriol instead of water."},{"pageContent":"22. THE GUEST OF HONOR B. A. Behrend was an engineer of great distinction and was himself in line toreceive the prized Edison Medal. But he also felt keenly the injustices done toTesla.It was outrageous, he believed, that the man who had created the modern age ofelectric power, with all its blessings to people and industry, towns and citiesaround the world, should now be struggling to keep a hotel roof over his head.It was outrageous that he was being deprived of reward and honor for hisinvention of radio while others commercialized it; that he had received littlecredit for lighting inventions that were profiting others; thatelectrotherapeutics, adapted by more practical men from his high-frequencyapparatus, was growing into a field of medical technology that seemed to benefitalmost everyone but the inventor. And just the year before, Dr. Edwin Northruphad gone back for inspiration to the old ideas and circuits of Tesla to devisehis first high-frequency furnace, a debt that he at least had graciouslyacknowledged. Behrend the engineer enumerated to himself only the more prosaicof Tesla’s achievements and felt outraged.He quickly found that persuading the AIEE to confer the Edison Medal upon Teslawas easy compared to getting the inventor to accept it. He did not want theEdison Medal. He would not receive it.“Let us forget the whole matter, Mr. Behrend,” he said. “I appreciate your goodwill and your friendship but I desire you to return to the committee and requestit to make another selection. . . . It is nearly thirty years since I announcedmy rotating magnetic field and alternating-current system before the Institute.I do not need its honors and someone else may find it useful.”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos955554]The old wounds, reopened, bled bitterness. How indeed could the AIEE have beenso remiss? More than three-quarters of the members of the Institute probablyowed their own jobs to Tesla’s inventions.Since the hostility between Edison and Tesla was well known, it probably hadbeen assumed that he might feel a certain distaste for the medal’s name; butBehrend, knowing that the inventor both needed and deserved such acclaim at thisperiod, insisted.That brought down the rain of acid.“You propose,” said Tesla, “to honor me with a medal which I could pin upon mycoat and strut for a vain hour before the members and guests of your Institute.You would bestow an outward semblance of honoring me but you would decorate mybody and continue to let starve, for failure to supply recognition, my mind andits creative products which have supplied the foundation upon which the majorportion of your Institute exists.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos955715]It was rare for Tesla to reveal personal feelings toward Edison but now hepulled no punches. “And when you would go through the vacuous pantomime ofhonoring Tesla you would not be honoring Tesla but Edison who has previouslyshared unearned glory from every previous recipient of this medal.”Behrend, however, refused to let the matter rest there. After several visits toTesla’s office, he persuaded him to accept the honor.Tesla passed the Engineers’ Club almost daily, but no longer went inside. Thebuilding stood, as it still does, directly across from Bryant Park, therectangle of sooty grass and listless trees behind the public library where hewent each day to feed his pigeons. Many engineers observed the strange tallfigure, less magnificently dressed than in his prime yet still erect and proud,as he entered the park to be greeted by swirls of birds. Pigeons even then wereconsidered socially unmeritorious. Their hunger seemed to touch only people whowere, like them, in need. Pigeons appealed to quirky, lonely, unreliable,usually poor, and eccentric persons. Important engineers did not hang about incity parks feeding dirty birds.Journalists too had noticed Tesla on his avian missionary work. Going home aftermidnight a reporter might find him standing in the darkness, lost in thought,with a bird or two taking food from his hands or lips, even though it waswell-known that birds were blind at night and preferred to be in their roosts.At such times Tesla was apt to make it clear to the reporters that he did notcare to talk with them. Later two of them would find out why.Another journalist told of meeting him wandering about in Grand Central Station.When asked if he had a train to catch, he replied, “No, this is where I do mythinking.”On the night of the Edison Medal presentation ceremony, a banquet was held inthe Engineers’ Club. Afterward the members and guests were to reconvene acrossthe alley in the United Engineering Societies building on 39th Street forspeeches.It was a splendid white-tie affair. The guest of honor was impeccable, theradiance of his personality shining forth as forcefully as in his youth. Alleyes followed his tall, charismatic presence. Yet somehow between the banquethall and the nearby auditorium, he vanished.How such a flagpole figure managed to disappear, Behrend could not for the lifeof him understand. The committee was in a dither, and a search was begun for theguest of honor. Waiters peered into rest rooms. Behrend, thinking Tesla mighthave become ill, rushed into the street to take a taxi to Tesla’s hotel, the St.Regis. But following an impulse, he found his steps turning instead towardBryant Park.Making his way through the gathering dusk, Behrend reached the entrance to thepark, only to find it blocked by a group of strollers watching something in theshadows. Behrend edged his way in, and there stood Tesla festooned from head totoe in pigeons. They perched upon his head, pecked feed from his hands, andcovered his arms, while a living, gurgling carpet of birds swarmed over hisblack evening pumps. The inventor spotted Behrend and cautiously raised a fingerto his lips, disengaging feathered friends in the process.Finally, while Behrend stood anxiously by, Tesla dusted feathers from his fineryand consented to be led back into the hall to receive his tribute.Behrend’s formal testimonial to his old friend was eloquent and sincere:“Were we to seize and eliminate from our industrial world the results of Mr.Tesla’s work,” he reminded his colleagues, “the wheels of industry would ceaseto turn, our electric cars and trains would stop, our towns would be dark, ourmills would be dead and idle. Yes, so far reaching is his work that it hasbecome the warp and woof of industry. . . . His name marks an epoch in theadvance of electrical science. From that work has sprung a revolution….”> He closed by paraphrasing Pope’s lines on Newton:> “Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night;> God said, Let Tesla be, and all was light.”3> [../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos955851]The guest of honor found himself warming to the assemblage. He was after allhuman, and it was right and proper that these words should be spoken. He waspleased when W. W. Rice, Jr., president of the AIEE, reminded the audience ofthe scientific progress that had flowed from Tesla’s research in oscillatingcurrents.“From his work followed the great work of Roentgen, who discovered the Roentgenrays,” said Rice, “and all that work which has been carried on throughout theworld in following years by J. J. Thomson and others, which has really led tothe conception of modern physics. His work . . . antedated that of Marconi andformed the basis of wireless telegraphy . . . and so on throughout all branchesof science and engineering we find . . . important evidence of what Tesla hascontributed….”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos956094]The guest of honor rose at last with applause in his ears and found within himthe power to speak graciously of Thomas Edison. He recalled his first meetingwith “this wonderful man, who had had no theoretical training at all, noadvantages, who did all himself, getting great results by virtue of his industryand application….”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos956221]Moving on he spoke rather longer than the engineers had expected, describing hischildhood and later life, telling humorous anecdotes, and revealingly explaining“why I have preferred my work to the attainment of worldly rewards. . . .” Teslasaid that he was deeply religious, although not in the orthodox meaning of theword, and gave himself “to the constant enjoyment of believing that the greatestmysteries of our being are still to be fathomed and that, all the evidence ofthe senses and the teachings of exact and dry sciences to the contrarynotwithstanding, death itself may not be the termination of the wonderfulmetamorphoses we witness.“I have managed to maintain an undisturbed peace of mind, to make myself proofagainst adversity, and to achieve contentment and happiness to a point ofextracting some satisfaction even from the darker side of life, the trials andtribulations of existence. I have fame and untold wealth, more than this, andyet—how many articles have been written in which I was declared to be animpractical unsuccessful man, and how many poor, struggling writers, have calledme a visionary. Such is the folly and shortsightedness of the world! . . .”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos956348]Some years later Dragislav Petković, visiting from Yugoslavia, would walk withthe inventor to Bryant Park on his daily mission of mercy and hear a revealingcomment.“Mr. Tesla looked up at the [library] windows, which are fenced with the ironbars, that some pigeons did not fall down somewhere and got freezed,” herecalled. “In one corner he spotted one which was halfway frozen. He told me tostay here and watch that the cat does not come to get him while he look up forothers. While I was watching, I tried to reach the pigeon, but could not do itbecause the bars were so close to one another. When Mr. Tesla returned, hequickly bended and pull him out.“‘All things from childhood are still dear to me,’” he told Petković, as hebegan to pat the almost frozen pigeon, assuring it that it would recover.“Then,” said Petković, “he took the package from my hand and started throwingthe food all around in front of the library. When he distributed the food hetold me: ‘These are my sincere friends.’”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos956475]• • •With the business of the Edison Medal over, Tesla entrained for Chicago anddevoted the remainder of the year to efforts to develop a variety ofinventions—not only in America but in Canada and Mexico. Thus he hoped to makeup for his wartime losses of European royalties.8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos956650] Theprevious year a trial balance of the Nikola Tesla Company had shown capitalstock worth $500,000, laboratory expenses of $45,000 and patent expenses of$18,938. Scherff, preparing his tax returns on a weekend, reminded the inventorthat the government could now fine him $10,000 for failure to file. If there wasa net profit that year, Scherff failed to mention it in his letter.9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos956849]From his headquarters at the Blackstone Hotel, Tesla went to work, offering notmerely his inventions but himself as a consultant. A major offering was hisbladeless fluid turbo-generator for lighting systems, small, simple, andunusually efficient, as the prospectus stated, an apparatus of “overwhelmingsuperiority.”He had licensed his automobile speedometer to the Waltham Watch Company, only tosee auto manufacturing halted by the war. Nevertheless during 1917 he had anincome of $17,000 in speedometer and locomotive-headlight royalties.He struggled over a report for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,hoping to supply the government with a small aircraft motor one-fifth the weightof the Liberty motor then used. An exchange of correspondence with NACA (thepredecessor of NASA) failed to result in a contract.To Scherff, when he could spare a few moments from arduous days, he scribbledthat his research on a new wireless transmitter that would render messagesabsolutely secret “will secure for the U.S. an overwhelming advantage in thegreat conflict as well as in peace. . . .”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos957048] At thesame time he was promoting the Tesla Nitrates Company, the Tesla ElectroTherapeutic Company, and the Tesla Propulsion Company. The former, based on anelectrical process for making fertilizer from nitrates (nitric acid) capturedfrom the air (which he had alluded to in the Century magazine article of 1900)proved to be economically impractical.Determined to escape from debt, he also maintained at long distance a laboratoryfor turbine work at Bridgeport, Connecticut. There he had contracted as wellwith the American & British Manufacturing Company to erect two wirelessstations. Unfortunately these Wardenclyffe-type enterprises failed for lack ofadequate capital.No one could any longer claim that Tesla was not commercializing. He made moneyon some of these enterprises—not spectacular amounts but enough to begin payingoff his debts to Scherff and to keep a staff.To Johnson, now harried by creditors, he wrote: “Write your splendid poetry inserenity. I will do away with all your worries. Your talent cannot be turnedinto money, thanks to the lack of discernment of the people of this country, butmine is one that can be turned into carloads of gold. I am doing this now.”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos957245]Johnson became ill. He wrote to remind Tesla of an old debt of $2,000, and theinventor at once sent a check for $500. Two weeks later Robert again wrote thathe needed funds, this time for taxes, and Tesla sent another $500. Before theyear was out Robert sent an SOS saying that he had only $19.41 in his bankaccount, with outstanding debts of $1,500. Once again Tesla reached for hischeckbook.12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos957453]In his desk in New York lay a letter, some years old, from Katharine Johnson,one of the last that was kept, or perhaps written, by her to her “ever silentfriend.” She had gone to Maine without her children or husband for part of thesummer.“I came here a month ago, quite alone,” she wrote, “to this hotel full, butempty for me, since it is a strange world. Here, I am as detached as if nothingbelonged to me but memory. At times I am filled with sadness and long for thatwhich is not—just as intensely as I did when a young girl and I listened to thewaves of the sea, which is still unknown, and still beating about me. And you?What are you doing? I wish I could have news of you my ever dear and ever silentfriend, be it good or bad. But if you will not send me a line, then send me athought and it will be received by a finely attuned instrument.“I do not know why I am so sad, but I feel as if everything in life had slippedfrom me. Perhaps I am too much alone and only need companionship. I think Iwould be happier if I knew something about you. You, who are unconscious ofeverything but your work and who have no human needs. This is not what I want tosay and so I am Faithfully yours, KJ.”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos957669]She added a postscript: “Do you remember the gold dollar that passed between youand Robert? I am wearing it this summer as a talisman for all of us.”Money? Good fortune? A return to the happiness and excitement of earlier days?Would it be a talisman for the trio that had shared so much?"},{"pageContent":"23. PIGEONS People speak of decades as if they form natural endings, when in fact theyseldom end anything cleanly. Human survivors are dragged into new slices of timewith which they feel no harmony and in which they are often exposed to raspingchange. So it was for Tesla in the Roaring Twenties.The twenties brought the hypocrisy of Prohibition. A dignified man could nolonger walk into his favorite bar and order a drink, but was instead forced toresort to illegal rotgut, bathtub gin, or worse. Speakeasies and gangstersflourished. Flaming Youth and bead-twirling flappers danced the nights away tothe Charleston; the stock market alternately soared and dived, while speculatorsmade and lost fortunes. James J. Walker, the Whoopee Mayor of New York, was oneof those attuned to the times. Nikola Tesla, Victorian in manner and appearance,was not. He was, if anything, more estranged than ever from the world about him.Hobson, who had been a Congressman and was soon to be honored with theCongressional Medal (carrying the rank of rear admiral) for his courage duringthe Spanish-American War, had lost his recent bid for the U.S. Senate. But hehad not lost—to Tesla’s intense regret—his campaign against drink and had beeninstrumental in obtaining passage of the Eighteenth Amendment. To TeslaProhibition constituted an intolerable bureaucratic invasion of personalliberty. He freely expressed his opinion that it would shorten lives, includinghis own. He no longer could foresee living until the age of 140. Without thedivine ambrosia in modest but regular amounts, who would care to?Yet when the Hobson family returned to Manhattan to live, Tesla was well enoughpleased that he and the sometime hero could be close again. Hobson took up thereins of other worthy campaigns, including leadership of an internationalcommission on narcotics, but he always found time for his old friend. He beganthe habit of hunting Tesla up in his hotel once a month to attend a moviematinee. It was a curiously frivolous diversion for such a distinguished pair.They would emerge from stale darkness into the glare and clangor of a TimesSquare afternoon and move off to a favorite park bench. There they would talk ofworld politics and science, or reminisce about old times.Now in his mid-sixties, Tesla was almost always hard up. At times strangeillnesses troubled him. The businesses he had worked so hard to build up inChicago were dwindling away. Wardenclyffe was no more than a sad memory, yet henever ceased to strive for the development of his world wireless system. In 1920he again approached Westinghouse executives with a wireless proposal. Theirrejection brought from him a tart reminder that, at the time of obtaining rightsto his alternating-current system, the directors had promised him that “nothingwill be turned down that you may put before the Westinghouse Company.” He hadrelied upon their assurance, he said, “knowing that men of that stature usuallyfeel a sense of obligation to the pioneer who lays the foundations to theirsuccessful business….”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos958016]He found the firm’s attitude doubly frustrating because they were in fact nowentering the wireless field, and Tesla had heard that they planned to put up abroadcasting system. “In the first place I was astonished and keenlydisappointed,” he wrote, “that the matter should have been put before yourengineers. . . . I would never submit anything to them except complete plans,thoroughly worked out in every detail….” Westinghouse officials responded byoffering him a temporary consulting job.The following year Westinghouse inadvertently insulted him by writing that theyhad begun operation of a Radio-phone Broadcasting System at Newark, New Jersey,presenting news broadcasts, concerts, and crop and market reports; and invitinghim as a guest to speak to their “invisible audience.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos958243]Haughtily he reminded them that he had long worked to develop a broadcastingsystem to encompass the globe: “I prefer to wait until my project is completedbefore addressing an invisible audience and beg you to excuse me.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos958462]At the same time, however, he again offered Westinghouse the designs of his“commercially superior turbine,” which he assured them would save the firmmillions of dollars. But he warned that there could be no strings. He couldproduce the turbines at once but would not consent to agree to “anyexperimenting whatever.”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos958668] Theresponse was tiresomely familiar. Board chairman Guy E. Tripp wrote that theycould not enter such an agreement because their engineers were negative on thesubject, “and of course we must be guided by the opinion of our Engineers.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos958906]Two special friends entered Tesla’s life in this period, a sculptor and awriter, whose respective talents would help to preserve his name andachievements from the obscurity that could befall even a famous person who hadneither heirs nor a corporate identity to prod the public’s memory. Thenineteen-year-old science writer, Kenneth M. Swezey, arrived on the scene tojoin the ranks of the inventor’s permanent coterie; and the Yugoslav sculptor,Ivan Meštrović, middle-aged and already famous in Europe, came to New York tointroduce his work to America.Tesla and the sculptor cherished common memories of their childhoods in themountains of Yugoslavia. Both were poets at heart. They met often in New York,talking about anything and everything. Both worked late into the night and had asimilar problem. Meštrović was forced to wrangle his hunks of marble from onehotel to another for lack of a studio; Tesla, to his great sadness, could nolonger afford a laboratory. So they took long walks together, discussed Balkanaffairs, their work, and shared their pleasure in reciting Serbian poetry. Alongthe way, Meštrović was introduced to the daily routine of feeding the pigeons ofManhattan.Long after the sculptor had returned to Split, Tesla at the urging of RobertJohnson wrote and asked him to do a bust of himself. He could not go to Europehowever, and Meštrović was unable to return to America. Nevertheless, the latterwrote back, saying that he remembered the inventor so well that, if Tesla wouldsend a photograph, he would undertake the job.6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos959094] Teslareplied that he had no money; Meštrović answered that none was needed. Good ashis word, he sculpted and cast in bronze a powerful and sensitive likeness (nowto be seen at the Tesla Museum in Belgrade) that transcended the miles, theyears, and mere realism to capture the brooding essence of genius.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_069.html#filepos1168708]As for young Swezey, on meeting the inventor for the first time in 1929, he wassurprised to discover (as he wrote) “a tall skinny man of upright posture” whomight go about for hours in a daze of concentration, but who also had a sideintensely human and “almost painfully sensitive with fellow-feeling foreverything that lives.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos959424]Swezey himself, residing in a bleak apartment in Brooklyn, had few close ties tofamily or friends. He became both a journalistic champion of the scientist and adevoted admirer. The old man and the younger were often together. Although Teslaworked hard while others slept, he also knew how to refresh himself with longrambles through the city. Swezey often joined him on these nocturnal excursions.He too was introduced to the pigeons. One evening as they were walking downBroadway, with Tesla discoursing intensely on his system for sending electricalpower wirelessly to the ends of the Earth, the inventor suddenly lowered hisvoice. “However, what I am anxious about at this moment,” he said, “is a littlesick bird I left up in my room. It worries me more than all my wireless problemsput together.”The pigeon, which he had picked up two days before in front of the library, hada crossed beak which had started a cancerous growth on its tongue so that itcould not eat. Tesla had saved it from slow death and said that with patienttreatment it would soon become strong and well.But not all of the birds he saved could be fitted into his hotel room, where theservants already complained of dirt. “In a large cage in a bird shop,” wroteSwezey, “are several dozen more pigeons. . . . Some had wing diseases, othersbroken legs. At least one was cured of gangrene, which the bird specialistpronounced incurable. If a pigeon is afflicted with something that Tesla has notthe facilities to treat, it is put under the care of a competent physician.”He and Swezey, as they walked, talked of Einstein, diet, exercise, fashion,marriage. “Tesla’s only marriage has been to his work and to the world,” wrotethe young man, “as was Newton’s and Michelangelo’s . . . to a peculiaruniversality of thought. He believes, as Sir Francis Bacon did, that the mostenduring works of achievement have come from childless men….”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos959731]The inventor confided to his young companion that mental anguish, fire,commercial opposition, and other trials had merely fanned his productiveness andthat he still felt he could rise highest in the face of great resistance. Healso said that he had earned in his lifetime over $2 million. Yet, for him tohave earned this sum he probably would have to have received the legendary $1million for his alternating-current patents from Westinghouse.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_070.html#filepos1169023]Because so many strange interpretations have been made of Tesla’s devotion topigeons, the following letter from Tesla to Pola Fotić, the young daughter ofKonstantin Fotić, Yugoslavian ambassador to the United States, is cited for itssimple portrayal of love for the creatures of his childhood. Entitled “A Storyof Youth Told by Age,” he describes the winter isolation of the house where hewas born, and of his special friend, “the magnificent Mačak, the finest of allcats in the world.”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos959936]It was in connection with Mačak that his first intimation of electricity came tohim one snowy evening when he was three years of age. “People walking in thesnow left a luminous trail behind them,” he wrote, “and a snowball thrownagainst an obstacle gave a flare of light like a loaf of sugar hit with a knife.. . .” Even at that early age his vision was hyperreceptive to light. Footprintsin the snow were not in muted shades of blue, purple, or black as they mightseem to others.“I felt impelled to stroke Mačak’s back. What I saw was a miracle which made mespeechless…. Mačak’s back was a sheet of light, and my hand produced a shower ofcrackling sparks loud enough to be heard all over the place.”His father told him this was caused by electricity. His mother said to stopplaying with the cat lest he start a fire. But the child was thinkingabstractly.“Is nature a gigantic cat? If so who strokes its back? It can only be God, Iconcluded.”Later, as darkness filled the room, Mačak shook his paws as though he werewalking on wet ground, and the boy distinctly saw the furry body surrounded by ahalo like the aura of saints. Day after day he asked himself what electricitycould be, and found no answer. At the time of writing this letter, eighty yearshad gone by, and Tesla said that he still had no answer.In contrast to the cat’s delightful company was the family gander— “a monstrousugly brute, with a neck of an ostrich, mouth of a crocodile and a pair ofcunning eyes radiating intelligence and understanding like the human.” In oldage Tesla claimed to have a scar inflicted by the monstrous bird. But the othercreatures on the farm he loved.“I liked to feed our pigeons, chickens, and other fowl, take one or the otherunder my arm and hug and pet it.” And even the vicious gander, when it broughtits flock home at night after “sporting like swans” in a meadow brook, “was ajoy and inspiration to me.” Now, in New York, as he withdrew more and more froma frenzied age and from people with whom he felt little harmony, his fondnessfor pigeons took on a strange intensity.He became alarmingly ill in his office on 40th Street one day in 1921 and, asusual, refused to see a doctor. When it became apparent that he might be unableto return to his apartment at the St. Regis Hotel, he whispered to his secretaryto telephone the hotel, speak with the housekeeper on the fourteenth floor, andtell her to feed the pigeon in his room—“the white pigeon with touches of grayin her wings.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos960140] Heinsisted that the secretary repeat this urgent message after him. Thehousekeeper was to continue feeding the pigeon each day until further notice.She would find plenty of feed in the room.Whenever in the past the inventor had been unable to visit Bryant Park with thefeed, he had hired a Western Union messenger to take care of the errand for him.The white pigeon, it was apparent, was special to him. From his attitude, hissecretaries thought he might be delirious.He recovered, and the matter was forgotten—until another day, when he telephonedhis secretary to say the pigeon was very ill and that he could not leave thehotel. Miss Skerritt recalled that he spent several days at home. When thepigeon had recovered, he resumed his usual routine of working, walking,thinking, and feeding the birds.About a year later, however, he arrived at his office looking shaken anddistraught. In his arm he carried a tiny bundle. He summoned Julius Czito, wholived in the suburbs, and asked if he would bury the dead pigeon on hisproperty, where the grave could be properly cared for. But scarcely had themachinist returned home on this curious mission than he received a phone callfrom Tesla, who had changed his mind.“Bring her back, please,” he said, “I have made other arrangements.” How hefinally disposed of her, his staff never knew.Three years later Tesla was completely broke and his bill at the St. Regis Hotelhad gone unpaid for a long time. One afternoon a deputy sheriff arrived at hisoffice and began seizing his furnishings to satisfy a judgment against them.Tesla managed to persuade the officer to grant him an extension. When he hadgone, there remained the matter of his secretaries, who had received no salariesin more than two weeks. All that was left in his Mother Hubbard’s cupboard of asafe was the gold Edison Medal, which he now removed. It was worth about onehundred dollars, he said to the embarrassed young women. He would have it cut intwo and give half to each.Dorothy Skerritt and Muriel Arbus declined in one voice. They offered instead toshare with him the small sums of money in their own purses.11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos960312] WhenTesla was able to pay them a few weeks later, he placed an additional two weeks’salary in each envelope. Yet on the day when he had offered to divide up theEdison Medal, there had in fact been a little money in the office—$5 in pettycash. But this he claimed at once for his pigeons, saying he was out of birdseed. He had asked one of his secretaries to go out and buy a fresh supply.With the help of Czito, to whom he also owed a substantial amount of money, hethen moved all his office belongings into a new office building. The next blowfell shortly afterward when he was asked to vacate the St. Regis Hotel, in partbecause of his pigeon friends. At one point Tesla had put some of the birds intoa hamper and sent them home with patient George Scherff, thinking that a spellin Connecticut might do them good. But alas, so fond were they of their oldfriend and of their risky old haunts that they were back on his window ledge intime for dinner.Sadly he packed up his possessions of decades and moved to the HotelPennsylvania. The pigeons followed. After another few years, he and they wouldbe forced to move on to the Hotel Governor Clinton. Nikola and his birds were tospend the final decade of his life in the Hotel New Yorker.The strange tale of the white pigeon was told by the inventor to O’Neill andWilliam L. Laurence, science writer for The New York Times, one day while thethree sat in the Hotel New Yorker lobby. John O’Neill, a member of a psychicsociety, saw mystic symbolism in Tesla’s white pigeon. He and other psychics whohave written about the inventor preferred to speak of the pigeon as a dove.Although pigeons are technically rock doves, only the most meticulousbirdwatchers ever call them that and Tesla never called his pigeon anything buta pigeon. But what he told the two journalists in the hotel lobby, says hisearly biographer, was the dove love-story of his life.“I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them, for years,” he said. “Thousandsof them, for who can tell—.“But there was one pigeon, a beautiful bird, pure white with light gray tips onits wings; that one was different. It was a female. I would know that pigeonanywhere.“No matter where I was that pigeon would find me; when I wanted her I had onlyto wish and call her and she would come flying to me. She understood me and Iunderstood her.“I loved that pigeon.“Yes, I loved her as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. When she was ill Iknew, and understood; she came to my room and I stayed beside her for days. Inursed her back to health. That pigeon was the joy of my life. If she needed me,nothing else mattered. As long as I had her, there was a purpose in my life.“Then one night as I was lying in my bed in the dark, solving problems, asusual, she flew in through the open window and stood on my desk. I knew shewanted me; she wanted to tell me something important so I got up and went toher.“As I looked at her I knew she wanted to tell me—she was dying. And then, as Igot her message, there came a light from her eyes—powerful beams of light.”Tesla paused and then, as if in response to an unasked question from the sciencewriters, continued.“Yes, it was a real light, a powerful, dazzling, blinding light, a light moreintense than I had ever produced by the most powerful lamps in my laboratory.“When that pigeon died, something went out of my life. Up to that time I knewwith a certainty that I would complete my work, no matter how ambitious myprogram, but when that something went out of my life I knew my life’s work wasfinished.“Yes, I have fed pigeons for years; I continue to feed them, thousands of them,for after all, who can tell—.”The writers left him in silence and walked several blocks along Seventh Avenuewithout speaking.O’Neill later concluded: “It is out of phenomena such as Tesla experienced whenthe dove flew out of the midnight darkness and into the blackness of his roomand flooded it with blinding light, and the revelation that came to him out ofthe dazzling sun in the park at Budapest, that the mysteries of religion arebuilt.” Had Tesla not rigorously suppressed his mystical inheritance, he wrote,“he would have understood the symbolism of the Dove.”12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos960459]Dr. Jule Eisenbud, in an article for the Journal of the American Society forPsychical Research, has examined the bird symbolism in the inventor’s life inconjunction with his neuroses and his childhood relationship with his mother, tothe extent that the latter is known. The bird is an age-old universal symbol ofthe mother and her nourishing breast, says the psychologist. And it wassignificant that Tesla believed he could command his beautiful white pigeon toappear, wherever he was, with only his wish. “The meaning of this fantasy,” heasserts, “can be arrived at only when viewed in conjunction with the strongevidence from other biographical data that the unconscious need for, and forcontrol of, the ‘disappearing’ mother had dominated Tesla throughout his life,accounting not only for many of his clinically peculiar habits, and much thatwas out of the ordinary in his relationship to people and things, but even forthe private mythology in terms of which he seems unconsciously to have conceivedthe powerful all-pervading force he devoted his life to capturing andharnessing.”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos960606]Nothing in Tesla’s writings indicates to the lay person that he felt deprived bya “disappearing” mother. But Dr. Eisenbud sees in his life many signs of anemotionally and physically deprived infantile nursing period. Tesla consciouslyidealized his mother, insists Eisenbud, yet he managed to stay clear of her,“and for most of his life was given to unfulfilled premonitions (all but thelast unfulfilled, that is) of her death, her ultimate disappearance. This kindof ambivalence, the sort of thing seen frequently in persons who are knownclinically as obsessional neurotics, which Tesla definitely was, marked all hisrelationships to and attitudes toward mother symbols and mother substitutes.”Thus, says Eisenbud, he could not tolerate smooth round surfaces, and pearls ona woman made him physically sick. He speaks of an obsessional patient of his ownwho, on his mother’s testimony, had gone into a deathlike depression whenabruptly taken off the smooth round breast at the age of two weeks and in laterlife could not stand even the word sphere.Dr. Eisenbud believes the inventor’s attitude toward money was also indicativeof a deep-lying fantasy of having virtual control of this universal mothersymbol at the source:“He gave away millions in gestures of great, if sometimes bizarre generosity,and was often broke as a result. He was, however, apparently dominated by thecomforting belief that fundamentally he was not dependent on fate or otherpeople for his sustenance, and that money itself, a trivial and incidentalaspect of the tedious mechanics of living, he could make in sufficient amountswhenever he needed it. . . . The most extraordinary facet of Tesla’snever-ending game of control of the mother, however, was played out with fooditself, where, unhappily, the negative side of his ambivalent attitude towardthis most direct of all mother substitutes finally won out….”14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos960872]Hence, he says, the elaborate ceremony Tesla made of dining, arriving in eveningclothes at the appointed hour, to be shown to his special table, the head waiterbecoming an expensive mother surrogate “the symbolic control of whom is notinfrequently striven for by those in the chips.”He remarks on the fact that one of Tesla’s favorite dishes was squab: “In abeautiful clinical example of biting the breast that didn’t feed him (the otherside of the coin of his compulsive feeding of pigeons) he would… eat only themeat on either side of the breastbone.”As the wheel of his life came full circle, says Eisenbud, Tesla was reduced toliving mostly on warm milk. Then it was that his beautiful white pigeon “gaveforth her last dazzling, blinding beam of light—a symbol equated with the streamof milk from the breasts. . . .”15[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos961000] Tesla’slifetime of compensation and ersatz collapsed. Something went out of his life,and he knew that his work was finished.Behavioral theorists will argue with such Freudian/Jungian conclusions, however,tending to believe that specific traumatic incidents in Tesla’s childhood,leading to emotional repression accounted for his obsessional neuroses.Unfortunately a lack of conclusive data makes it impossible to do more thanspeculate."},{"pageContent":"24. TRANSITIONS Katharine Johnson fell ill. Tesla showed his concern by prescribing for her aspecial diet, but the deeper illness from which she suffered, the sense that inthe midst of life everything worthwhile had somehow slipped from her, deprivedher of the will to recover. She lay in the house at 327 Lexington Avenue withthe blinds drawn, remembering the parties, the celebrities, the gossip andreflected glory, the street crowded with arriving and departing hansom cabs andautos, the wonderful banquets presided over by Tesla at the Waldorf-Astoria, thethrill of his galvanic presence at her table, and how hard they had all workedto entrap wealthy patrons for him. She remembered the scintillating gatheringsat his laboratory, the demonstrations, the excitement of his triumphal toursabroad. Her entire being seemed to have dissolved into a blur of memories. Thelife lived had not been hers; she did not know whose it had been. Her life hadbeen a reflection only, of the risks and acts and triumphs of others. Now shefelt a stranger to herself, stripped equally of hope and anger. She feltdeluded, cheated, and infinitely weary.During the time when she languished Tesla was brashly inspired to think aboutwriting one of his more curious prophecies—on the future of women. It was asubject on which he gyrated and fussed and yet seemingly could not leave alone.The year before she was stricken, he had given an interview to a Detroit FreePress reporter on the “problem” of women.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos961279] Withthe glibness of any other male, he bemoaned their descent from the pedestals sothoughtfully built by men for their entrapment. He had worshipped women all hislife, he said—out of special deference, from afar. But now that they werematching their minds against men’s, venturing into open competition with God’snaturally appointed, was not “civilization itself in jeopardy”? The answer was aquestion that presumably went unasked by most Sunday supplement readers of the1920s: Whose civilization?Now, with Katharine’s illness preying on his thoughts, he turned the matter overrelentlessly in his mind and finally gave another interview, this time toCollier’s.2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos961554] Thearticle was threateningly entitled, “When Woman Is Boss,” and described a newsex order in which the female would emerge as intellectually superior. On theone hand he appeared to be all for it, but on the other, filled withtrepidation. Had he understood the real waste of Katharine’s life? Whatever hismotivation, he ended up ambivalently prophesying men and women into humanbeehives in a disturbingly mechanistic view of the Utopian “rational” society.It was clear to any trained observer, he said, that a new attitude toward sexualequality had come over the world, receiving an abrupt stimulus just before theFirst World War. Naturally he could not foresee that in the wake of the SecondWorld War women would again backslide and relinquish much social and economicgain in a compulsion to procreate.Few feminists would have quarreled with the first part of Tesla’s premise: “Thestruggle of the human female toward sex equality will end in a new sex order,with the female as superior. The modern woman, who anticipates in merelysuperficial phenomena the advancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom ofsomething deeper and more potent fermenting in the bosom of the race.“It is not in the shallow physical imitation of men that women will assert firsttheir equality and later their superiority, but in the awakening of theintellect of women.“Through countless generations, from the very beginning, the social subservienceof women resulted naturally in the partial atrophy or at least the hereditarysuspension of mental qualities which we now know the female sex to be endowedwith no less than men.“But the female mind has demonstrated a capacity for all the mental acquirementsand achievements of men, and as generations ensue that capacity will beexpanded; the average woman will be as well educated as the average man, andthen better educated, for the dormant faculties of her brain will be stimulatedto an activity that will be all the more intense and powerful because ofcenturies of repose. Women will ignore precedent and startle civilization withtheir progress.”But the ideal society that Tesla went on to describe, modeled on that of thehive—with “desexualized armies of workers whose sole aim and happiness in lifeis hard work”—could not have failed to chill his fellow men and thinking women.“The acquisition of new fields of endeavor by women, their gradual usurpation ofleadership,” he said, “will dull and finally dissipate feminine sensibilities,will choke the maternal instinct, so that marriage and motherhood may becomeabhorrent and human civilization draw closer and closer to the perfectcivilization of the bee….”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos961709]The perfect communal life of the bee was radical chic for the times, promising“socialized cooperative life wherein all things, including the young, are theproperty and concern of all.”But in the same freewheeling interview Tesla made uncannily farsightedtechnological predictions: “It is more than probable that the household’s dailynewspaper will be printed ‘wirelessly’ in the home during the night. The problemof parking automobiles and furnishing separate roads for commercial and pleasuretraffic will be solved. Belted parking towers will arise in our large cities,and the roads will be multiplied through sheer necessity, or finally renderedunnecessary when civilization exchanges wheels for wings.“The world’s internal reservoirs of heat . . . will be tapped for industrialpurposes.” Solar heat would partially supply the needs of the home; wirelessenergy would supply the remainder; and small vest-pocket instruments, “amazinglysimple compared with our present telephone,” would be used. “We shall be able towitness and hear events—the inauguration of a President, the playing of a WorldSeries game, the havoc of an earthquake or the terror of a battle—just as thoughwe were present.”Katharine died in 1925. Not forgetting Tesla even at death, she charged Robertto keep in close touch with him always.Johnson and his daughter Agnes (the future Agnes Holden) tried thereafter tocelebrate traditional family holidays. Tesla was always invited. They invitedhim on Katharine’s birthday, Robert writing, “We will have music, the kind ofoccasion she would have desired. She cherished your friendship. She charged menot to lose sight of you. Without you it will not be her day.”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos961836]But soon Robert was again asking for financial help—to pay taxes and a bankloan. Tesla, scraping along on a few royalties and consulting fees, was able tolend small sums. Although he had been ill again, he sent a cheerful note withhis check: “Do not let those small troubles worry you. Just a little longer andyou will be able to indulge in flights on your Pegasus.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos962029]Johnson thanked him and announced that he and Agnes were sailing for Europe fortwo months. On this trip he met a teenaged actress who was to gladden for a timehis final years.6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos962221]In April of the following year Tesla sent Johnson an unsolicited $500 with anote: “Please do not let this remind you of vulgar creditors, but have a littlecelebration.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos962418] Johnsonreplied that he was having a wall erected at Kate’s grave with half of it. Hereported that the “lovely Marguerite [Churchill]” was keeping him young and thathe was eager for the inventor to meet her.Shortly afterward Johnson was hospitalized and from his bed wrote Tesla: “Youmust come and dine with Mrs. Churchill and Marguerite when I return.” He ravedabout the young actress, whom he now hoped to accompany to Europe, “with hermother, of course.”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos962617] Theywould visit the homes and haunts of Tennyson, Keats, Shakespeare, Wordsworth.Instead, however, he went back to Europe with Agnes the following year and againin 1928, on both occasions with the aid of checks from the hard-pressed Tesla.Francis A. Fitzgerald, who had been a personal friend of Tesla’s since thedevelopment of Niagara Falls and who was with the Niagara Power Commission atBuffalo, tried to assist the inventor with one of his most cherished scientificconcepts in 1927. He interceded with the Canadian Power Commission to finance aproject to transmit power without wires. The venture was not carried out, but itplanted in the minds of some Canadians a seed that regenerates itself every fewyears down to the present writing in efforts to transmit hydroelectric powerwirelessly and inexpensively through the Earth.For years it had been rumored that Tesla had invented a powerful beam, a deathray, but he had been strangely uncommunicative on the subject. In early 1924 aflurry of news reports from Europe claimed that a death ray had been inventedthere—first by an Englishman, then by a German, and then a Russian. Almost atonce an American scientist, Dr. T. F. Wall, applied for a patent on a death raywhich he claimed would stop airplanes and cars. Then a newspaper in Coloradoproudly retorted that Tesla had invented the first invisible death ray capableof stopping aircraft in flight while he had been experimenting there in 1899.9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos962815] Theinventor was unusually noncommittal on the matter.In 1929 when Scherff again filled out tax returns for the Nikola Tesla Companyhe told Tesla: “Unfortunately the Company had no tax to pay.” In this respect hewas at least in tune with the times, for now the Great Depression had begun.Tesla wrote another cheerful note to raise the spirits of his old friendJohnson, while yet admitting to his own “little financial fainting spells.” Hesaid, “Of course I am not communicative with other friends. My prospects arebetter… another very fine and valuable new invention.” If he were one of the newinventors who employed press agents, he said, “the whole world would be talkingabout it.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos962991]In fact, however, his patent filings had at long last almost dwindled to a stop.He had filed a series of new patents in 1922 in fluid mechanics, which were notprocessed to completion. Thus they entered the common domain. One among them isbelieved to have particular significance.

THE BIRTHDAY PARTIES Born at midnight, never sure which date to celebrate, Tesla usually had notobserved his birthdays at all. They had simply slipped by, and as long as hefelt well, their passage had gone unnoticed.He took pride in the fact that his weight had not changed since college days.Legends were told about his catlike fitness. Walking down Fifth Avenue one icywinter day, he had lost his footing, hurled himself into a flying somersault,landed on his feet, and kept on walking. Bug-eyed pedestrians swore that theyhad never seen anything like it outside of a circus.But in old age he began to make up for the missed birthdays. Each anniversarybecame the occasion for a celebration with reporters and photographers. At theseparties, to the delight of his young friends, he announced fantastic inventionsand indulged in prophesy to his heart’s content. Only sober Mr. Kaempffert, withthe dignity of the Times to uphold, found such sessions grating. How they hungon the guru’s every word as he spun his visionary nonsense. And worst of all,how they pretended to understand!1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos963336]A very special birthday party was arranged by Swezey for Tesla’s seventy-fifthanniversary. This shy young science writer was a person of few words—one whoknew him remembers that he spoke almost cryptically—yet he was extraordinarilygifted in his ability to make science understandable to lay audiences bytranslating abstractions into graphic images. He made party games of science andthought up puzzles and simple kitchen-table experiments that captivatedchildren. He wrote a book, After-Dinner Science, that enjoyed a popular success,especially with the parents of school-aged children. He also wrote advancedarticles for scientific magazines.Tesla was a hero to him. Swezey was, of course, more capable than the averageperson of appreciating the inventor’s importance in the perspective of thehistory of science, and like Behrend, he was troubled by the public’sshort-mindedness. He resolved to do something about it.And so, for the inventor’s seventy-fifth birthday party in 1931, he asked famousscientists and engineers the world over to send some thing, and a flood ofcongratulatory letters and tributes to Tesla poured in. Among the authors wereseveral Nobel laureates who acknowledged, with respect and gratitude, hisinspiration to their own careers.2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos963504]Robert Millikan wrote of attending a Tesla lecture at the age of twenty-five,one of the first demonstrations of the Tesla coil. “Since then,” he wrote, “Ihave done no small fraction of my research work with the aid of the principles Ilearned that night so that it is not merely my congratulations that I am sendingyou but with them also my gratitude and my respect in overflowing measure.”Arthur H. Compton declared: “To men like yourself who have learned first handthe secrets of nature and who have shown us how her laws may be applied bysolving our everyday problems, we of the younger generation owe a debt thatcannot be paid….”All the past presidents of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers senttributes along with many leaders in the burgeoning field of modern radio.Lee De Forest wrote of his deep personal obligation to Tesla as scientist andinventor: “For no one so excited my youthful imagination, stimulated myinventive ambition or served as an outstanding example of brilliant achievementin the field I was eager to enter, as did yourself…. Not only for the physicalachievement of your researches on high frequencies which laid the basicfoundations of the great industry of radio transmission in which I have labored,but for the incessant inspiration of your early writings and your example, do Iowe you an especial debt of gratitude.”Dr. Behrend spoke of “the world’s usual ingratitude toward its benefactors.“To those of us who have lived through the anxious and fascinating period ofdevelopment of alternating-current power transmission,” he said, “there is not ascintilla of doubt that the name of Tesla is as great here as the name ofFaraday is in the discovery of the phenomena underlying all electrical work.”Einstein, who seemed unaware of Tesla’s prodigious range of achievement, senthis felicitations but congratulated him only on his contributions to the fieldof high-frequency current.Among Europeans who sent accolades were Dr. W. H. Bragg, co-winner of thecontroversial 1915 Nobel Prize in physics. From the Royal Society in London hewrote, alluding to the demonstrations made by Tesla in his lectures forty yearsearlier:“I shall never forget the effect of your experiments which came first to dazzleand amaze us with their beauty and interest.”Count von Arco, the German radio pioneer who with Prof. Adolf Slaby haddeveloped the Slaby-Arco system wrote: “If one reads your works today—at a timewhen radio . . . has attained such a world significance—particularly yourpatents (practically all of which belong to the past century), one is againastonished at how many of your suggestions, often under another’s name, havelater been realized….”Swezey, the catalyzer of this outpouring of tributes, added his own mosteloquently. Tesla’s genius, he said, had given startling impetus to the work ofRoentgen and J. J. Thomson and those who followed them in the age of theelectron. “Standing alone,” said the science writer, “he plunged into theunknown. He was an arch conspirator against the established order of things.”If these encomia seem immoderate, they pale beside the comments of famed scienceeditor and publisher Hugo Gernsback: “If you mean the man who really invented,in other words, originated and discovered—not merely improved what had alreadybeen invented by others— then without a shade of doubt Nikola Tesla is theworld’s greatest inventor not only at present but in all history…. His basic aswell as revolutionary discoveries, for sheer audacity, have no equal in theannals of the intellectual world.”Alerted by Swezey to the birthday tributes, newspapers and magazines all overthe world carried articles on Tesla. Time magazine’s cover story reported thatits writers had some difficulty tracking the elusive inventor (“a tall . . .eagle-headed man”) to his most recent aerie at the Hotel Governor Clinton.Interviewers regretted they could not see him as he used to be seen in hisColorado laboratory, wrote Time, “strolling or sitting like a calmMephistopheles amid blazing, thundering cascades of sparks ….”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos964033]What they found instead was a Tesla emaciated and almost ghostlike but stillalert. His hair was slate gray, his overhanging eyebrows almost black. But thesparkle of his blue eyes and the shrillness of his voice indicated his psychictension.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos964183]When Swezey presented the inventor with the bound memorial volume, he found himsurprised but scarcely overwhelmed. Although he merely said that he did not carefor compliments from people who all his life had opposed him, the young sciencewriter felt that secretly Tesla was pleased by the many tributes. Indeed, laterwhen Swezey tried to borrow them briefly (copies were sent to the new TeslaInstitute at Belgrade), the old man was most reluctant to part with them.To interviewers Tesla had disclosed the ideas that currently preoccupied histhoughts. He was working on two things: one, conclusions that tended to disprovethe Einstein Theory of General Relativity. His explanations, Tesla said, wereless involved than Einstein’s, and when he was ready to make a fullannouncement, it would be seen that he had proved his conclusions.Secondly, he was working to develop a new source of power. “When I say a newsource, I mean that I have turned for power to a source [to] which no previousscientist has turned, to the best of my knowledge. The conception, the idea whenit first burst upon me was a tremendous shock.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos964310]He said of this new source of power that it would throw light upon many puzzlingphenomena of the cosmos. And in another enigmatic comment that puzzles Teslascholars down to the present day, he said it might prove of great industrialvalue “particularly in creating a new and virtually unlimited market forsteel.”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos964437]Questioned further, he would only say that such power would come from anentirely new and unsuspected source, that for all practical purposes it would beconstant day and night and at all times of the year. The apparatus formanufacturing this energy and transforming it would be of ideal simplicity withboth mechanical and electrical features.Tesla said the preliminary cost might be thought too high, but this would beovercome, for the installation would be both permanent and indestructible. “Letme say,” he emphasized, “that [it] has nothing to do with releasing so-calledatomic energy. There is no such energy in the sense usually meant. With mycurrents, using pressures as high as 15 million volts, the highest ever used, Ihave split atoms but no energy was released….”Pressed to reveal his new source of energy, he politely declined, but promiseddefinitely to make a statement on the subject “in a few months, or a few years.”His eyes glowing beneath the black brows, he said that he had already conceivedof a plan for transmitting energy in large amounts from one planet toanother—absolutely regardless of distance.“I think that nothing can be more important than interplanetary communication,”he said. “It will certainly come some day and the certitude that there are otherhuman beings in the universe, working, suffering, struggling, like ourselves,will produce a magic effect on mankind and will build the foundation of auniversal brotherhood that will last as long as humanity itself.”When? He was unsure.“I have been leading a secluded life, one of continuous, concentrated thoughtand deep meditation,” he replied. “Naturally enough I have accumulated a greatnumber of ideas. The question is whether my physical powers will be adequate toworking them out and giving them to the world….”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos964564]Also in the seventy-fifth year of his life, Everyday Science & Mechanics carrieddetailed designs of two of the inventor’s more down-to-earth proposals—a planfor extracting electricity from seawater and another for a geothermal steamplant.8 [../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos964691]The geothermal steam plant was designed to draw upon the almost inexhaustibleheat of the deep earth, with water circulating to the bottom of a shaft,returning as steam to drive a turbine, and then returned to liquid form in acondenser, in an unending cycle. Such ideas were not original with Tesla, havingbeen speculated upon for at least seventy-five years, but he was among the firstto draw up detailed designs.His seawater power plant would utilize heat energy derived from the temperaturedifferential between layers of ocean water to operate great power plants. Heeven went so far as to design a vessel to be propelled by energy derived fromthis source.But his research into the matter was at best preliminary. He still had toovercome the same problems that earlier pioneers had experienced— greattechnological difficulties and costs far out of proportion to the greatestpossible returns; yet he continued to work and improve the design, substitutingfor pipes hung in submarine abysses a sloping tunnel lined with heat-insulatingcement. His associates, he said, had made studies in the Gulf of Mexico andCuban waters where temperature contrast would be adequate.Tesla explored several variations—one that operated without storage batteries;one that operated without water pumps—but he was still unsatisfied with hisseawater plants, finding their performance too small to be competitive withother sources. Undaunted, he continued to predict that the technical problemswere soluble and that one day such plants would be major producers of power.Tesla did not live to see such a plant built, except in his mind. But in the1980s the federal government has authorized a crash program of research on OceanThermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plants in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean,Hawaii, and wherever temperature contrasts are adequate. A small army ofuniversity scientists appear to be employed on these joint ventures ofgovernment and private utilities.Professor Warren Rice of Arizona State University, an authority on Tesla’s workin turbines and fluid mechanics, has analyzed his anticipation of OTEC ideas andof geothermal energy recovery and finds them “thermodynamically sound.” But headds that he, personally, is pessimistic about the economic feasibility andpracticality of OTEC and of terrestrial energy recovery on a large scale. “Ihope that I am wrong,” he adds.9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos964928]In his old age Tesla was gratified to hear his invention of electricaloscillation devices for medical therapy receive high accolades. At the AmericanCongress of Physical Therapy in New York on September 6, 1932, Dr. GustaveKolischer of Mount Sinai Hospital and Michael Reese Hospital, Chicago, announcedthat high-frequency electrical currents were bringing about “highly beneficialresults” in dealing with cancer, surpassing anything that could be accomplishedwith ordinary surgery.10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos965105]Modern cancer treatment has, of course, progressed even farther and the fullmedical implications of Tesla’s techniques are still being explored. Mostrecently, in the 1980s, the American Association for the Advancement of Scienceannounced promising research in the electromagnetic stimulation of cells for theregeneration of amputated limbs. And studies at various universities have alsoindicated that pulsed current is superior to direct current in the healing offractures.As is typical of so many of Tesla’s inventions, scholars still do not know thewhole range of their possible applications or, in some cases, even their fulltheoretical significance."},{"pageContent":"26. CORKS ON WATER George Sylvester Viereck was a German immigrant, the child of an illegitimateoffspring of the House of Hohenzollern. He came to America in his youth, stirredthe avant-garde with his precociously brilliant poetry, and became acontroversial figure in politics and journalism. Intellectuals considered him agenius. But as his interviews with the rising stars of fascism, Hitler andMussolini, betrayed his strong partiality for dictators, the poet’s reputationwas damaged, much as Ezra Pound’s would be a few years later. The issue came toa head during World War II when Viereck was imprisoned for disseminatingpro-Nazi propaganda.He and Tesla became friends between the wars, the inventor as usual beingpolitically uncritical. They often corresponded and met socially in New York.Viereck wrote insightful articles about Tesla, and the two exchanged their ownpoetry. The German’s tenuous claim to royalty and his literary talent may haveappealed equally to Tesla, who addressed some of his most revealingcorrespondence to this new confidante.The only sample extant of the inventor’s own poetry, called “Fragments ofOlympian Gossip,” and written in his distinctive hand, was dedicated to Viereck,“my Friend and Incomparable Poet,” on December 31, 1934. Tesla was thenseventy-eight years of age. The poem begins, “While listening to my cosmic phone/ I caught words from the Olympus blown,” which gives a fair indication of itsliterary merit. It is a crotchety work, but not without humor and occasionalnice turns of phrase.On April 7 Tesla wrote to Viereck, urging him to stop taking the “poison” ofopium tincture, lest it make his precious brain sluggish. It appears thatViereck also was seeking escape from financial anxieties, for Tesla added: “Itis too bad that the greatest poet of America is no better situated than astruggling inventor. How about writing a little article on Spiritism and drawingon my experience as told in a letter to you? The spiritists are so crazy thatthey will claim I got the message all right but as a crass materialist I wasprejudiced….”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos965566]He added a P.S. that his admiration for Viereck was so great that hishandwriting had even begun to resemble the poet’s.In December he wrote a long, strange letter to Viereck going back over the deathof his brother Daniel so long ago, and the death of his mother. He attempted toexplain away his precognition and discussed his affliction with partial amnesia.The letter was written as if from different time frames, without transitions,and with confusing errors as to Daniel’s age when he died and the date of hismother’s death. It is almost as though Tesla were describing dreams rather thanreality.He spoke of periods of tortured concentration driving him to fear a blood clotor atrophy of the brain, and of how he struggled to “drive out of the mind theold images which are like corks on the water bobbing up after each submersion.But after days, weeks or months of desperate cerebration I finally succeed infilling my head chuckfull with the new subject, excluding everything else, andwhen I reach that state I am not far from the goal. My ideas are always rationalbecause I am an exceptionally accurate instrument of reception, in other words,a seer. But be this true or not I am always mighty glad when I get through forthere can be no doubt that such a surtax of the brain is fraught with greatdanger to life.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos965728]Viereck’s writings—not so much in his correspondence as in his publishedwork—also give us an interesting impression of what Tesla might have beenthinking about at this time. In a 1935 magazine article entitled “A Machine toEnd War,” Viereck reported on what Tesla believed the world would be like in theyears 2035 and 2100.“Man in the large,” said the inventor, “is a mass urged on by a force. Hence thegeneral laws governing movement in the realm of mechanics are applicable tohumanity.”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos965894]He saw three ways in which the energy determining human progress could beincreased: first, the improvement of living conditions, health, eugenics, etc.;second, reduction of the intellectual forces that impede progress, such asignorance, insanity, and religious fanaticism; third, the enchaining of suchuniversal sources of energy as the sun, ocean, winds, and tides.He believed his own mechanistic concept of life to be “one with the teachings ofBuddha and the Sermon on the Mount.” The universe was “simply a great machinewhich never came into being and will never end. The human being is no exceptionto the natural order. Man, like the universe, is a machine. Nothing enters ourminds or determines our actions which is not directly or indirectly a responseto stimuli beating upon our sense organs from without. Owing to the similarityof our construction and the sameness of our environment, we respond in likemanner to similar stimuli, and from the concordance of our reactions,understanding is born. In the course of ages, mechanisms of infinite complexityare developed, but what we call ‘soul’ or ‘spirit,’ is nothing more than the sumof the functionings of the body. When the functioning ceases, the ‘soul’ or the‘spirit’ ceases likewise.”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos966107]Tesla pointed out that he had expressed these views long before thebehaviorists, led by Pavlov in Russia and Watson in the United States, andstated that such an apparently mechanistic view was not antagonistic to anethical or religious conception of life. In fact, he believed that the essencesof Buddhism and Christianity would comprise the religion of the human race in2100.Eugenics would then, he believed, be firmly established. In a harsher timesurvival of the fittest had weeded out “less desirable strains,” Tesla reasoned.“Then man’s new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings ofnature,” and the unfit were kept alive. “The only method compatible with ournotions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit bysterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct. SeveralEuropean countries and a number of states of the American Union sterilize thecriminal and the insane.”How much of this pitiless doctrine was the aging Tesla and how much pureViereck, one cannot say. Whoever was responsible, he was only just getting intohis stride. “This is not sufficient,” according to Tesla. “The trend of opinionamong eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no onewho is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A centuryfrom now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a personeugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.” By 2035, a Secretary ofHygiene or Physical Culture would be more important than a Secretary of War.Sounding rather more like the real Tesla, the putative Tesla goes on to foreseea world in which water pollution would be unthinkable, in which the productionof wheat products would be adequate to feed the starving millions of India andChina, in which there would be systematic reforestation and the scientificmanagement of natural resources, in which there would at last be an end todevastating droughts, forest fires, and floods. And of course, the long-distancewireless transmission of electricity from water power would end the need to burnother fuels.In the twenty-first century civilized nations would spend the greater part oftheir budgets on education, the least on war. He had at one time believed thatwars could be stopped by making them more destructive. “But I found that I wasmistaken. I underestimated man’s combative instinct, which it will take morethan a century to breed out. . . . War can be stopped, not by making the strongweak but by making every nation, weak or strong, able to defend itself.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos966234]Here he was referring to a “new discovery” that would “make any country, largeor small, impregnable against armies, airplanes, and other means of attack.” Itwould require a large plant, but once established, it would be possible to“destroy anything, men or machines, approaching within a radius of 200 miles. Itwill, so to speak, provide a wall of power offering an insuperable obstacleagainst any effective aggression.”He explicitly stated, however, that his invention was not a death ray. Raystended to diffuse over distance. “My apparatus,” he said, “projects particleswhich may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us toconvey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy thanis possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus betransmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist. Thiswonderful feature will make it possible, among other things, to achieveundreamed-of results in television, for there will be almost no limit to theintensity of illumination, the size of the picture, or distance of projection.”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos966361]It was to be not radiation but a charged particle beam. Almost half a centurylater the two most powerful nations in the world would be racing to perfect sucha weapon.Tesla also predicted that ocean liners would be able to cross the Atlantic atgreat speed by means of “a high-tension current projected from power plants onshore to vessels at sea through the upper reaches of the atmosphere.” In thisconnection he alluded to one of his earliest concepts: such currents, passingthrough the stratosphere, would light the sky and to a degree turn night intoday. It was his idea to build such power plants at intermediate points, such asupon the Azores and Bermuda.The deepening political turmoil in Europe in the mid-1930s did not spareYugoslavia. The Serbian ruler, King Alexander, who had established a Yugoslaviandictatorship following a move toward separatism by Croatia, was assassinated atMarseille in 1934 by a Croat terrorist.Tesla promptly wrote to The New York Times in defense of the “martyred” monarch.Seeking to minimize the historic differences separating Serbs and Croats, hedescribed King Alexander as “a heroic figure of imposing stature, both theWashington and Lincoln of the Yugoslavs . . . a wise and patriotic leader whosuffered martyrdom.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos966879] It wastrue enough that there had never been unification of the Slaves until Alexanderforced it upon them, but it would take another strongman (Tito) to make itstick.Alexander was succeeded by his son, the young King Peter II, under the regencyof Prince Paul. Tesla accordingly transferred his loyalty to the boy king, whowould grow up prematurely in a world aflame.Meanwhile, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had been elected President of the UnitedStates. Proclaiming a New Deal and calling Congress into a special session (thefamous “100 Days”), he achieved passage in a short space of time of morelong-lasting social legislation than had ever before been undertaken. In doingso he fused the rage of political opponents and drew charges of wanting to“pack” the Supreme Court. Tesla was one of those who, having voted forRoosevelt, soon found his socialistic whirlwind alarming.More than ever, the inventor seemed obsessed with his mysterious new defensiveweapon. In a last poignant appeal for capital to J. P. Morgan, he wrote: “Theflying machine has completely demoralized the world, so much so that in somecities, as London and Paris, people are in mortal fear from aerial bombing. Thenew means I have perfected affords absolute protection against this and otherforms of attack….“These new discoveries which I have carried out experimentally on a limitedscale, created a profound impression. One of the most pressing problems seems tobe the protection of London and I am writing to some influential friends inEngland, hoping that my plans will be accepted without delay. The Russians arevery anxious to render their borders safe against the Japanese invasion and Ihave made them a proposal which is being seriously considered.“I have many admirers there,” he continued, “especially on account of theintroduction of my alternating current system…. Some years ago Lenin made metwice in succession very tempting offers to come to Russia but I could not tearmyself from my… work.”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos967111]Tesla went on to say that words could not express how he ached for a laboratoryagain and for the opportunity of squaring his account with the senior Morgan’sestate. “I am no longer a dreamer but a practical man of great experience gainedin long and bitter trials. If I had now $25,000 to secure my property and makeconvincing demonstrations, I could acquire in a short time colossal wealth.Would you be willing to advance me this sum if I pledged to you theseinventions?”He closed with an attack upon Roosevelt’s program, no doubt calculated to softenMorgan: “The ‘New Deal’ is a perpetual motion scheme which can never work but isgiven a semblance of operativeness by unceasing supply of the people’s capital.Most of the measures attempted are a bid for votes and some are destructive toestablished industries and decidedly socialistic. The next step might be thedistribution of wealth by excessive taxing if not conscription….”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos967313]Morgan, who had his own Depression problems, failed to rise to the bait. For anonscientist it was virtually impossible to tell whether Tesla was talking senseor nonsense.He had made a similar offer of his “particle beam” to Westinghouse that spring,to which Vice-President S. M. Kintner had replied that he had discussed with aresearch specialist “the general proposal of creating rays of the kind youmention.” But the specialist had been skeptical, “so much so in fact that Ihesitate to propose to Mr. Merrick your suggestion of a six months’ advancepayment to enable you to file patents.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos967440]Although it is always tempting to cast Tesla in the role of prophet withouthonor, it is conceivable that the research specialist was correct about the“particle beam.” Tesla was perfectly capable of going off half-cocked, as hisforays into metallurgy (in part the result of his dissatisfaction with themetals available for use in his turbine) suggest.He formulated a process for degasifying copper (removing the bubbles to producea superior metal) and interested the American Smelting and Refining Company(ASARCO) in it. Dr. Albert J. Phillips, then superintendent of the centralresearch department of ASARCO, recalls meetings with Tesla on the project. Inthe depths of the Depression he would arrive at the firm’s laboratories in PerthAmboy from the Hotel McAlpin in New York where he then lived, in a spendidchauffeur-driven limousine. He usually wore a frock coat, gray striped trousers,gray spats, and carried a cane with a gold knob.“Dr. Tesla was a fine distinguished gentleman whom I liked very much,” Dr.Phillips told me. “He was probably the world’s greatest electrical theorist ofthe time. However, he was not a metallurgist and failed to realize that therewas a great deal known about metals that he did not know. His experiments in thefield of copper metallurgy were poorly planned and completely unsuccessful.Nevertheless I learned a great deal from my association with him and recall fondmemories of his idiosyncrasies.”11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos967634]The inventor’s theory was that gas bubbles dispersed in a liquid were underpressures much higher than those computed by accepted theories, and he believedthat such pockets of air or nitrogen, if small enough, would have the samedensity as copper in the liquid form. He arrived at the plant with completedrawings of an apparatus he wished built to prove his theory.“I immediately informed him,” recalls Dr. Phillips, “that the apparatus he hadso carefully designed would not melt copper and could not possibly subjectliquid copper to bombardment under vacuum to remove the hypothetical gas bubblesfrom it. I also told Dr. Tesla that there was plenty of evidence to prove thatthese hypothetical gas bubbles could not exist in molten copper to any greatextent.”The two discussed their differences in a friendly scientific manner, “but[Tesla] was not swayed from his beliefs by my objections. . . .” So theyproceeded to build the apparatus exactly as Tesla had designed it. And theresults were just as the research superintendent had predicted. At last, liquidcopper that had been melted elsewhere was poured into the equipment, subjectingthe stream of metal to high vacuum and bombardment against a “Lava” targetbefore it issued from the bottom into a mold.“We finally obtained several samples of copper through the machine,” Phillipsrecalls, “which instead of being densified were quite gassy and were in no waydifferent from copper that had not been subject to the Tesla treatment.”And then, since the budget was badly overrun, the experiments were ended. To thebest of Dr. Phillips’ recollection, ASARCO had initially approved $25,000 forthe venture (“In 1933 that was a lot of money and hard to come by”) and may haveextended it later by a similar amount.12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos967817]A curious detail emerged from these recollections. Tesla showed Dr. Phillips “aphotograph of a cancelled check for $1 million, if I remember correctly, that hehad received from the Westinghouse Electric Company for one of his patents orinventions.” Since there is no record anywhere else of this check, the mysteryof the payment for his alternating-current patents remains unresolved.With occasional consulting jobs Tesla managed to survive the Depression and evenlent small sums to friends in greater need. In one especially tight spot he wentto Westinghouse and, for old times’ sake, was given a job that brought in $125 amonth for a brief period. Another time he turned to Robert Johnson and receivedhelp in his “temporary financial fainting spell,” the latter replying fromStockbridge, Massachusetts, “I have in the bank $178. So I send you herewith$100. I hope that will do. Heaven bless you!”Some time later Johnson fell ill. In his new “old” hand, he wrote: “At 83 I havejust published my book, ‘Your Hall of Fame.’… I shall not live to see your bustplaced there . . . but there it will be, never doubt, my great and good friend…“My heart is still yours for of all the years of friendship every day is dear.“I am told that I am on the mend but the recovery is a long time coming…”13[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos967953]Mend he did, however temporarily, for he was soon issuing an invitation to Teslawith a flash of the old gaiety: “Our ladies will wear their prettiest gowns andthe gentlemen will dress in your honor tomorrow, and I suggest that you run trueto form and look beautiful in evening dress for the ladies! I want them to seeyou at your handsomest….“Yours ever with remembrance of the happy old times, Luka J. Filipov.”14[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos968138]Then it was Tesla’s turn to be ill. He had grown gaunt and gray, seldom leavinghis hotel, subsisting on milk and Nabisco crackers. In his suite enameled emptycracker canisters, all neatly numbered, were stacked in rows on shelves. He usedthem as storage for odds and ends, as Swezey noted on his frequent calls. Thelatter was alarmed by the deterioration in the inventor’s condition.Johnson wrote: “God bless you and help you dear Tesla and may you recover tonormal and to this end, do let us come to you. Agnes will be of great use. Youhave only to telephone. Do this in memory of Mrs. Johnson….”15[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos968323] But hehimself had suffered a relapse and realized that the end was near. “Neither ofus can count on many years,” he wrote. “You have few friends besides the Hobsonsand us to look after you. Do let Agnes come to you. I cannot. Not to do thiswill be suicide, dear Nikola.”16[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos968520] Soon,however, the inventor had mended.The year 1937 was to be one of sad losses for Tesla. Hobson, his staunch friendof many years, died suddenly on March 16 at the age of sixty-six.Robert Johnson died on October 14, following recurring illnesses.Shortly afterward, on a cold midnight, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker on hisregular rounds to scatter feed for his pigeons. Only two blocks from the hotelhe was struck by a taxi and hurled to the street. Refusing medical care, heasked to be returned to his hotel room.Although in a state of shock, he telephoned a Postal Telegraph messenger,William Kerrigan, to call for the pigeon feed and finish his errand. For thenext six months, Kerrigan went daily to feed the flocks at St. Patrick’sCathedral and Bryant Park.It was discovered that Tesla had sustained three broken ribs and a wrenchedback. Complications from pneumonia followed, and he lay bedridden until thespring. Although he recuperated, his health remained even more frail thereafter,and he was subject to periods of irrationality.17[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos968705]From old friends at the Westinghouse Company came word that the Tesla Institute,which had been founded two years earlier at Belgrade, Yugoslavia, was seekinginformation about his early inventions. Tesla agreed to have his photo takenbeside his original split-phase alternating-current motor for the researchlaboratory that was being equipped in his honor at the institute.18[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos968867]An endowment had been underwritten for this purpose by the Yugoslav governmentand individual Slavs, and it would include an honorarium for Tesla of $7,200 peryear. Thanks to his native countrymen, “the greatest inventive genius of alltime” would at least not be destitute in his final years."},{"pageContent":"27. COSMIC COMMUNION One hears many strange things about him,” said Agnes J. Holden, the daughter ofRobert and Katharine Johnson. “It’s not right to judge a man who has passedeighty by what he did in his eighties. I remember Tesla when he was thirty-fiveyears old, young and gay, and full of fun.”But the inventor at eighty still enjoyed life and was in fact still formulatinghis far-reaching statement on the universe. Looking forward to his birthdayparties, he prepared papers for them months ahead and planned stunning headlinesfor his friends of the press. Increasingly, the parties were occasions forrefuting Einstein, defending Newton, and advancing the cosmic theories thatTesla himself had long mulled over.The ten-page statement he issued on his eightieth birthday in 1936 was neverpublished in its entirety. Both in it, and in letters to the Times, he waged acontinuing debate with leading physicists as to the nature of cosmic rays.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos969741]He alluded often to his own dynamic theory of gravity, which he said wouldexplain “the motions of heavenly bodies under its influence so satisfactorilythat it will put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that ofcurved space.” In his considerable writing on astrophysics and celestialmechanics, however, this theory of gravity was never elucidated.The curvature of space, he stated, was entirely impossible since action andreaction are coexistent. A curve would be counteracted by straightening. Norwould any explanation of the universe be possible without recognizing theexistence of ether and its indispensable function. The Einsteinian revolutionnotwithstanding, he remained convinced that there was “no energy in matter otherthan that received from the environment.” And this, he held, applied rigorouslyto molecules and atoms as well as to the largest heavenly bodies.In short, he was quite wrong.For the occasion of his eightieth birthday he spoke of yet more inventions forinterstellar communication and energy transmission.“I am expecting to put before the Institute of France an accurate description ofthe devices with data and calculations and claim the Pierre Guzman Prize of100,000 francs for means of communication with other worlds, feeling perfectlysure that it will be awarded to me,” he said. “The money, of course, is atrifling consideration, but for the great historical honor of being the first toachieve this miracle I would be almost willing to give my life.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos970248] Yearslater, however, the Institute of France denied that it had ever received anentry from Tesla. In fact, the Guzman Prize is still awaiting a successfulclaimant.“My most important invention from a practical point of view,” Tesla continued,“is a new form of tube with apparatus for its operation. In 1896 I brought out ahigh potential targetless tube which I operated successfully with potentials upto 4 million volts…. At a later period I managed to produce very much higherpotentials up to 18 million volts, and then I encountered insurmountabledifficulties which convinced me that it was necessary to invent an entirelydifferent form of tube in order to carry out successfully certain ideas I hadconceived. This task I found far more difficult than I had expected, not so muchin the construction as in the operation of the tube. For many years I wasbaffled . . . although I made a steady slow progress. Finally… complete success.I produced a tube which it will be hard to improve further. It is of idealsimplicity, not subject to wear, and can be operated at any potential, however,high…. It will carry heavy currents, transform any amount of energy withinpractical limits, and it permits easy control and regulation of the same. Iexpect… results undreamed of before. Among others, it will [make possible] theproduction of cheap radium substitutes in any desired quantity and will be, ingeneral, immensely more effective in the smashing of atoms and the transmutationof matter.” He cautioned that it would not, however, open up a way to utilizeatomic energy since his research had convinced him that this was nonexistent.3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos970590]He confessed to a certain annoyance because some newspapers had announced thathe was prepared to give a full description of his remarkable tube. This would beimpossible.Because of “some obligations I have undertaken regarding the application of thetube for important purposes,” he explained, “I am unable to make a completedisclosure now. But as soon as I am relieved of these obligations a technicaldescription of the device and of all the apparatus will be given to scientificinstitutions.”No patents were ever filed nor was a prototype displayed. The second discoveryhe wanted to announce at his party consisted of “a new method and apparatus forthe obtainment of vacua exceeding many times the highest heretofore realized. Ithink that as much as one-billionth of a micron can be attained. What may beaccomplished by means of such vacua… will make possible the production of muchmore intense effects in electron tubes.”*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_072.html#filepos1169976]There was a pause while wine was poured for his guests and glasses raised. Thenthe old man explained that he did not agree with ideas currently held regardingthe electron. He believed that when an electron left an electrode of extremelyhigh potential and in very high vacuum, it carried an electrostatic charge manytimes greater than normal.“This may astonish some of those who think that the particle has the same chargein the tube and outside of it in the air,” he said. “A beautiful and instructiveexperiment has been contrived by me showing that such is not the case, for assoon as the particle gets out into the atmosphere it becomes a blazing starowing to the escape of the excess charge….”†[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_073.html#filepos1170197]Tesla may have been on to something. Four decades later, the returns are stillnot in on the electrical charge of the electron. Physicists have been trying foryears to calculate the charges of subatomic and larger particles. Despiteconfusing results, no one but Tesla had been willing to suggest that an electriccharge could exist that was not equal to the charge of an electron, or ofintegral multiples thereof—no one, that is, until 1977 when three Americanphysicists reported that they had discovered “evidence for fractional charge.”The result, if confirmed, “is likely to stand as one of the most importantresults in physics of this or any century,” reported Science News.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos970740]Whetheror not subparticles called “loose quarks” are involved in this esoteric mysterymay prove to be at the heart of the matter. Tesla, although he did not know aquark from a gluon and lacked the elaborate research equipment of contemporaryscientists, had at his service what Hobson had once described as his “cosmicintuition.”The eighty-first birthday party was a replay of the year before in terms of theinventions announced by the guest of honor, but it brought more internationalrecognition.His old friend Ambassador Konstantin Fotić presented the Grand Cordon of theWhite Eagle, the highest order of Yugoslavia, in behalf of young King Peter IIthrough the Regent Paul. Then the Minister from Czechoslovakia, not to beoutdone, presented to Tesla the Grand Cordon of the White Lion in the name ofPresident Eduard Beneš. With this came an honorary degree from the University ofPrague.On this occasion the reporters questioned Tesla closely on his repeated claim ofhaving perfected an interplanetary communication system. Once more he alluded tohis intention of seeking the Pierre Guzman prize for this achievement.The invention, he said, was “absolutely developed.”“I couldn’t be any surer that I can transmit energy 100 miles than I am of thefact that I can transmit energy 1 million miles up,” he said. He spoke of a“different kind of energy,” as he had in the past, that would travel through achannel of less than one-half of one-millionth of a centimeter.5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos970909]Life on other planets was a “certitude.” One problem that troubled him, he said,was the danger of hitting other planets with his “needle-point of tremendousenergy,” but he hoped that astronomers would help to solve this problem.His point of energy, said the inventor, could easily be aimed at the moon, andEarthlings would then be able to see the effects, “the splash and thevolatilization of matter.” He suggested that advanced thinkers on other planetsmight even mistake the Tesla energy beam for some form of cosmic ray.Once again he alluded to his atom-smashing electronic tube with which cheapradium could be produced. “I have built it, demonstrated, and used it. Only alittle time will pass before I can give it to the world.”Were these merely the ramblings of an old man clinging to youthful dreams? Theprofessors pooh-poohed them, but science writers as usual took him seriously.The world was on the verge of global war. William L. Laurence of The New YorkTimes quoted Tesla in 1940 on the potential of erecting a “Chinese Wall” of his“teleforce” rays around the United States, which could melt airplanes at adistance of 250 miles. With $2 million to build a projection plant (was this the“limitless” market for steel Tesla had spoken of?), he claimed this could bedone in three months. Laurence proposed that the government take him up on it.The War Department, as usual, made no overture to the inventor.Teleforce, said Tesla, was based on four new inventions, of which two hadalready been tested: 1. a method of producing rays in the free air without avacuum; 2. a method of producing “very great electrical force”;3. a method of amplifying this force; and 4. a new method for producing“tremendous electrical propelling force.”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos971129]For years Tesla’s biographers would be unable to find evidence to support theexistence of working papers on these inventions. United States security agencieswould consistently disavow knowledge of such matters; which was curious, becausebiographer O’Neill declared that federal agents removed from his home evennonsensitive papers of Tesla’s, and he was never afterward able to discover whohad actually “borrowed” his files.Both O’Neill and (finally) Swezey were to conclude that Tesla’s so-called secretweapons were “so much nonsense.” O’Neill said, “The only knowledge I had was afirm belief that his theories, never adequately revealed to form a basis forjudgment, were totally impracticable.” At the same time, however, he admittedthat he was never privy to any of Tesla’s unpublished papers and that trying toget information from the inventor had always caused him to clam up in a directratio to the effort exerted.A further curious fact was that even Tesla’s proposals for his turbine andaircraft appeared to vanish from the federal archives.One of the final honors that came to the inventor found him too ill to make apersonal acceptance. The Institute of Immigrant Welfare in 1938 invited him to aceremonial dinner at the Hotel Biltmore for a citation. His friend Dr. Rado readhis speech, which contained high praise of George Westinghouse “to whom humanityowes an immense debt of gratitude.” In absentia Tesla again claimed that hewould win the Pierre Guzman prize for his work in cosmic communication.His last years were not entirely fixed on outer space, however, nor were theyeven entirely cerebral. Some of his intellectual friends were surprised, evenembarrassed, when with obvious pleasure, he began to fraternize with certainshy, burly, broken-nosed gentlemen of the boxing ring. This late-bloomingfascination with pugilists and boxing confused both Swezey and O’Neill.“Brain Dines Brawn,” declared a wire photo caption. A happy Tesla was shown attable with the amiable Zivic brothers: “Dr. Nicola Tesla, famed inventor, brokehis five-year, self-imposed exile in his suite at the Hotel New Yorker on Dec.18th when he played host to Fritzie Zivic, welterweight champion…. Dr. Tesla, anardent sports fan, predicted that Zivic would beat Lew Jenkins in theirnon-title bout . . .” The ever-admiring O’Neill, present at one of these meals,claimed that the psychic energy zinging between Tesla and the brothers made hisown skin itch and tingle. Another writer present admitted feeling the same oddeffects.Removed as he was from the events in Europe, Tesla was not to be spared thetragedies of war in his last years. The honors conferred upon him by Yugoslaviaand Czechoslovakia had been expressions by countries enjoying their last gaspsof intellectual freedom. Hitler soon invaded Austria and his demands for theautonomy of Germans in the Sudetenland led to a crisis of government inCzechoslovakia. President Eduard Beneš resigned after Britain, France, andItaly, without even consulting his government, acceded to German occupation ofthe Sudetenland.Next Yugoslavia’s Regent Paul outraged the people of that country by agreeing toa compromise with Hitler that committed Slavs to join the Axis powers. For oncediverse factions of Yugoslavia pulled together in defiance—Army, church, andpeasants; Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Immediately, the pro-Allied Serbianmilitary elements staged a successful coup and replaced Prince Paul with theseventeen-year-old King Peter II, who ascended the throne on March 28, 1941.It pleased Tesla that the son of King Alexander, whom he had admired, was nowthe monarch. His closest friends in the New York/Washington Slavic communitiesremained those of “Great Serbian” outlook attached to the Yugoslav Embassy underAmbassador Fotić. At that time the only Croat on the Embassy staff was a youngaide named Bogdan Raditsa (now a professor of Balkan history at FairleighDickinson University). But soon Tesla’s nephew, Sava Kosanović, a Serb born inCroatia, arrived in America to play what seemed to the frail old man a worryingand perplexing role.Events began moving too fast. The inventor, aware mainly of tensions andshifting alliances among the local Slavic population, scarcely grasped the factthat as the greatest living hero of the Yugoslavs, he had been singled out byfate as an ideological pawn between East and West."},{"pageContent":"28. DEATH AND TRANSFIGURATION The new government of King Peter, with broad popular support, confronted theGermans and refused to ratify the compromise agreement that had been made withHitler by Prince Paul. Almost at once reprisals began.On Palm Sunday, 1941, three hundred Luftwaffe bombers swept over the Yugoslavcapital of Belgrade. Methodically they crisscrossed the city street by street,strafing everything that breathed. By noon 25,000 civilians were dead, and thewounded lay everywhere. Most public buildings were left in ruins, including themodern laboratory known as the Tesla Institute.The combined armed forces of Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria invaded thedoomed country. Within only days the Yugoslav Army was crushed, and King Peterwas sent to England for safety. His government-in-exile would operate fromLondon for the remainder of World War II.This, however, was only the beginning of the war for Yugoslavs. Accustomed tosuccessive invasions for a thousand years, the people were resilient. Theremnants of the Army and Communist factions withdrew into the mountains, fromwhich they launched guerrilla attacks on the invaders. These armed fighters, menand women, were supplied with food grown by the old people and childrenremaining in undefended villages.Against them the Nazis and Fascists carried out murderous reprisals. In thefishing villages and along the stony slopes of the Adriatic, half the people inevery hamlet were systematically shot.Soon, however, it became apparent to military strategists in the United Statesand England that, not only were Axis forces killing Yugoslavs, but rivalguerrilla factions of monarchists and Communists had begun to vie for Alliedsupport and were shooting each other as well as the invaders.Col. Drazha Mihailović, a Serbian army officer, led a faction called Chetniks(the “Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland”), composed mainly of Serbian and Bosnianmonarchists. With close ties to King Peter, they became the first majorresistance movement in Europe.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos971491] Theinitial British aid to Yugoslavia went to the Chetniks, but it was short-lived.The National Liberation Army or Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito of theCommunist Party, was swiftly rising to prominence.Allied strategists knew little of Tito. It was said he had been left wounded ona battlefield in 1917 and captured by the Russians. There he was trained as aCommunist leader and sent to France during the Spanish Civil War to aid theLoyalists or Republicans.A Croat, Tito had little reason to love the monarchy, for he was imprisonedafter returning to Yugoslavia. On release, he became active in organizing ametal workers’ union and helped to build the Yugoslav labor movement. Hisemergence as head of the Partisans in World War II was that of a natural leaderwho inspired his fighters and maintained rigorous discipline. He was lookingahead to a time when the Slavs could rebuild a free and united country withoutoppression either by foreigners or kings.Tito’s goal was to set up committees of popular liberation after the Russianstyle, while Mihailović and the Chetniks favored local administrativeauthorities under the monarchy. Both factions kept on killing Germans andItalians but, unfortunately, they also continued murdering each other.2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos972005]Prof. Bogdan Raditsa,*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_074.html#filepos1170706] thendirector of the information service of the Yugoslav Embassy in Washington, D.C.,recalled, “The situation became rather complicated when Yugoslavia collapsed in1941 and when, at the end of that year, a Royal Yugoslav Mission came to thiscountry.” It was composed of members of King Peter’s government and the Ban(Governor) of Croatia, Dr. Ivan šubašić. Sava Kosanović, Tesla’s nephew, then amember of the Democratic Party, also arrived as a minister of the exiledgovernment.“As soon as Kosanović came to the States,” said Professor Raditsa, “he tried toreorient Tesla from the exclusive Serbian policy, and he succeeded. Tesla, evenbefore, never felt himself a Great Serbian chauvinist. He used to say, ‘I am aSerb but my fatherland is Croatia.’”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos972195]The conflict between Serbs and Croats in exile intensified as the war went on,paralyzing normal Slav diplomatic activities in London, Washington, and NewYork.“Kosanović, though a Serb,” recalled Raditsa, “was leading the struggle for abrotherhood between the Serbs and Croats against Fotić and many other Serbmembers of various Yugoslav missions. Thus he began using Tesla for the policydirected against the Great Serbians.“Tesla himself . . . was not aware of the deep conflict between the Serbs andCroats, and as basically a scientist and in old age, he was very candid inpolitics.”Raditsa said he seemed happy that he finally had a man of his own blood near himin New York and noted that Tesla began to rely upon Kosanović’s opinion oneverything. During this period the inventor was receiving about $500 per monthfrom the royal government as an honorarium.Various political messages elicited from Tesla for home consumption, saidRaditsa, were actually written by Kosanović.4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos972375]Toward the end of 1942 the Yugoslav Information Center was opened in New York inthe Royal Mission headquarters on Fifth Avenue. Raditsa and Kosanović workedtogether at this office, issuing bulletins and other publications. But a crisisbroke out when news reached them of the fighting between Mihailović and Tito.“Kosanović,” Raditsa said, “joined Tito and began to popularize the NationalLiberation Movement for a new Yugoslavia. He had a terrible time to convinceTesla that monarchy was losing in Yugoslavia and that a new Yugoslavia wasbeginning to come out from the fratricidal civil war. As the largest majority ofSerbs in Croatia were joining Tito, Kosanović convinced Tesla that he too shouldjoin the movement that was largely shared by the masses of the people, Serbs andCroats. So Tesla’s message to the Serbs and Croats was written by Kosanović.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos972502]On the walls of the Tesla Museum in Belgrade one may read a vastly enlargedphotocopy of the words allegedly sent by Tesla to his embattled countrymen onlymonths before his own death. American Vice-President Henry A. Wallace also had ahand in its drafting. Typewritten, it has many cross-outs and interlinings inTesla’s own handwriting, yet the style is that of an ideologue, which theinventor was not:> Out of this war . . . a new world must be born, a world that would justify the> sacrifices offered by humanity. This . . . must be a world in which there> shall be no exploitation of the weak by the strong, of the good by the evil,> where there will be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich;> where the products of the intellect, science, and art will serve society for> the betterment and beautification of life, and not the individuals for> achieving wealth. This new world shall not be a world of the downtrodden and> humiliated, but of free men and free nations, equal in dignity and respect for> man.The inventor’s name also appeared on another message—sent to the Soviet Academyof Sciences on October 12, 1941, urging joint struggle against the Axis powersby Russia, Great Britain, and America, in aid of the revolutionary struggle ofthe Yugoslav people. This message is not to be seen in the Museum, however,presumably because nostalgia Russian-style has ceased to be politic.Kosanović became chairman of the Yugoslav Economic Mission advocating a NewYugoslav federation versus the centralistic prewar royalist Yugoslavia. This neworganization also began working for a new Central East European Federation.Raditsa too became a member of the Tito movement.King Peter was desperately seeking for Mihailović the support of PresidentFranklin Delano Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill, as well as thatof his own Uncle Bertie, who was King George VI of England. The British, atfirst sympathetic to the Chetnik cause, began to change as they received reportsof the aggressive actions of Tito’s Partisans.In 1942 King Peter visited Washington to intercede with FDR. Yugoslav pilotswere being trained in Tennessee. FDR told him that America would send airplanesto the Chetniks as soon as they could be spared from the war in the Middle East.The monarch visited New York City, attending a large reception for the AmericanFriends of Yugoslavia at the Colony Club. The Colony, the first femalesocialites’ club in America, had been founded at the inspiration of energeticAnne Morgan. She attended the function, as did the King’s mother, Queen Marie,and Mrs. Roosevelt. It was the sort of affair Tesla himself would have delightedin had he not been weak and ill. So King Peter went to him.In his diaries (A King’s Heritage), under date July 8, 1942, the young Peter IIwrote: “I visited Dr. Nicola Tesla, the world-famous Yugoslav-Americanscientist, in his apartment in the Hotel New Yorker. After I had greeted him theaged scientist said: ‘It is my greatest honor. I am glad you are in your youth,and I am content that you will be a great ruler. I believe I will live until youcome back to a free Yugoslavia. From your father you have received his lastwords: “Guard Yugoslavia.” I am proud to be a Serbian and a Yugoslav. Our peoplecannot perish. Preserve the unity of all Yugoslavs—the Serbs, the Croats, andSlovenes.’”The King added that he was deeply touched and that both he and Dr. Tesla hadwept. He then visited Columbia University, to be warmly welcomed by PresidentNicholas Murray Butler and to find another link with his own country in thePupin Physics Laboratory.Returning to Washington, he was assured by FDR that food, clothing, arms, andammunition would be dropped over Yugoslavia. But he was shocked when, in 1943,the British Mission in Yugoslavia made official contact with Tito. Peter askedto be parachuted into his country, but Churchill demurred. Tito openly accusedMihailović of being a traitor.6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos972637]At the Teheran Conference in November there occurred, largely at Churchill’sinstance, what the King described as a “fatal change” of Allied policy. It wasdecided that “the basic force fighting the Germans in Yugoslavia recognized bythe Allies was the National Liberation Army, under the command of Tito, and thePartisan force received full recognition as an Allied Army. Mihailović was thusdenied and abandoned.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos972802]Winston Churchill overnight became a hero of modern Yugoslavia. And when theyoung monarch frantically wrote to FDR for support, the ailing President repliedurging him to accept Churchill’s advice “as if it was my own.” Within monthsRoosevelt died.Tesla’s nephew Kosanović, along with certain other diplomatic representatives ofKing Peter, had been dismissed by the monarch at the height of the 1942 crisis.He often told Bogdan Raditsa in those days that he felt Tesla had been terriblyshocked by his nephew’s exclusion from the royal government. In fact, Kosanovićbelieved that the inventor’s death was actually precipitated by his own“setback.”“He thought,” Kosanović repeatedly told Raditsa, “that I was punished, and thateventually I would be arrested or something of the kind, but I succeeded toconvince him that it was inevitable in politics.”8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos972929]During this period Kosanović was frank in saying that he tried to keep Teslafrom seeing members of the royal government. Ambassador Fotić had become “theenemy” since he still favored a Great Serbian policy as opposed to the changesahead. Tesla’s relationship with this old friend became “lukewarm.”“There is no doubt,” said Professor Raditsa, “that the whole internecine tragedyof Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1943 must have had a rather depressing impact uponTesla. Very often he would ask me, could I explain to him what was going onamong us, and why we cannot agree….”After the war, Mihailović would be executed by a “People’s Court” for allegedcollaboration with the enemy, and the Republic of Yugoslavia declared to exist,with Tito as President for life and the Communists firmly in charge.A count of Yugoslavian casualties at the end of World War II disclosed that 2million persons had died; tragically, many thousands had been killed by fellowYugoslavs.“After the war,” recalled Professor Raditsa, “Kosanović became a minister in theTito-šubašić Government, and I was his assistant in the Ministry of Informationfrom 1944 to 1945, when I left the country, for I couldn’t become a Communist.Later on in 1946, Sava Kosanović became Tito’s ambassador in Washington but Inever saw him again after I left Belgrade in October of 1945. Kosanović hadaccepted totally the Communist system in Yugoslavia and remained loyal until hisdeath.”There had not been a time in ten centuries when the Yugoslavs had not been ruledand ransacked by invaders—by Venetians, Romans, Turks, Bulgars, Austrians,Hungarians, Germans, Italians, when they were not living under threat oftorture, prison, or violent death. Now a marvelous truth began to dawn uponthem: that they were free, in a manner of speaking.Tesla would not live to see this. Whether he could ever have accepted the newgovernment, with its Soviet-type Constitution and a Soviet alliance, whether hecould ever have accepted the permanent exile of his beloved monarch, areunanswerable questions.Unfortunately, however, all this was to have a bearing on how he would beremembered in the West. The fading of his scientific reputation, theforgetfulness of Americans in the postwar period, resulted in large degree fromthe disappearance of most of his scientific papers behind that new Cold Warphenomenon, the Iron Curtain.In 1948 Yugoslavia ceased to be an Iron Curtain country, declaring itsindependence from the Soviet doctrine of “limited sovereignty.” America and herallies then were generous in sending economic and military aid to the Slavs; butthe damage had been done. America had not raced to Tito’s wartime support withthe alacrity that Churchill had shown. In the future it would not be made easyfor American scholars to draw on Yugoslav sources to document the achievementsof Nikola Tesla.The inventor became very feeble in the winter of 1942. His fear of germs was soobsessive that even his closest friends were required to stand at a distance,like the subjects of a neurotic Tudor. (Pigeon germs did not seem to worry him.)He had heart trouble and suffered occasionally from fainting spells. No longerable to feed his beloved birds, he often relied upon a young man named CharlesHausler, who owned racing pigeons, to take care of them for him.Hausler had worked for Tesla in this capacity from around 1928 onward, his jobbeing to go to the New York Public Library at noon each day with grain and thento walk around the four sides of the building looking for young or injured birdson window sills or behind large statues. He would take them to Tesla’s hotel forrest and recuperation. Then, he has recalled, “I would release them at thelibrary for him.” He remembered that the cages in Tesla’s rooms had been builtby a fine carpenter—“as Mr. Tesla was in all his doings it had to be doneright.” The pigeons also enjoyed a curtained shower bath.Hausler and Tesla spent many hours together, talking mostly of pigeons. OnceTesla confided to him that “Thomas Edison could not be trusted.” The boyremembered his employer as “a very kind and considerate human person,” and therewas one incident that stood out in his mind long afterward. “He had a large boxor container in his room near the pigeon cages and he told me to be very carefulnot to disturb the box,” said Hausler, “as it contained something that coulddestroy an airplane in the sky and he had hopes of presenting it to the world.”He believed it probably was stored in the cellar of the hotel later.9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos973087]On a bitter day in early January 1943, Tesla called his other messenger boy,Kerrigan, and gave him a sealed envelope addressed to Mr. Samuel Clemens, 35South Fifth Avenue, New York City. The boy set forth into the whipping wind andsearched fruitlessly for the number. As it turned out, this had been the addressof Tesla’s first laboratory; but now South Fifth Avenue was West Broadway, andno one by the name of Samuel Clemens lived in the area.Kerrigan made his way back to the Hotel New Yorker and reported to the sick man.In a weak voice, Tesla explained that Clemens was the famous Mark Twain and thateveryone knew of him. He sent Kerrigan forth once more, and this time asked himalso to take care of the pigeons. The perturbed messenger fed the birds and thenconsulted his supervisor, who told him that Mark Twain had been dead fortwenty-five years. Once again Kerrigan trudged through the cold afternoon toTesla’s rooms, where he explained and tried to return the envelope.The inventor was indignant and refused to hear that the humorist was dead. “Hewas in my room last night,” he said. “He sat in that chair and talked to me foran hour. He is having financial difficulties and needs my help. So—don’t comeback until you have delivered that envelope.” Once again the messenger went tohis supervisor and together they opened the envelope. It contained a blank sheetof paper wrapped around twenty five-dollar bills—enough to help an old friendthrough a little fainting spell.On the fourth of January, the inventor, although very weak, went to his officeto make an experiment that George Scherff was interested in. Scherff dropped into help him prepare for it. The work was interrupted, however, when Tesla felt arecurrence of some sharp pains in his chest.Refusing medical aid, he returned to his hotel. Next day a maid came in andcleaned. As she left, he asked her to put the Do Not Disturb sign on his door tokeep visitors away, and not to bother cleaning. The sign remained there thefollowing day and the one after that.Early on the morning of January 8, Alice Monaghan, a maid, ignored the sign andentered the apartment to find the inventor dead in bed, his sunken, emaciatedface composed.10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos973281]Assistant Medical Examiner H. W. Wembly examined the body, placed the time ofdeath as 10:30 P.M. on January 7, 1943, and gave his opinion that the cause ofdeath had been coronary thrombosis. Tesla had died in his sleep, and theexaminer noted that he had found “No suspicious circumstances.” The inventor waseighty-six years of age.Kenneth Swezey was notified at once; and at ten o’clock that morning hetelephoned to Dr. Rado at New York University. King Peter’s headquarters, thenat 745 Fifth Avenue, was advised by the professor. Tesla’s nephew Kosanović,then wartime president of the Eastern and Central European Planning Board forthe Balkan countries, also was notified.Then the FBI was called. Swezey and Kosanović summoned a locksmith and Tesla’ssafe was opened and the contents examined.The body was removed to the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home at Madison Avenue and81st Street and a sculptor was engaged by Hugo Gernsback to prepare a death maskof the inventor.Just before Tesla’s death, Eleanor Roosevelt had tried to intercede in hisbehalf with President Roosevelt—perhaps with the idea of conferring some honorupon him. In the Tesla Museum at Belgrade three brief notes on White Housestationery may be read. On January 1, at the request of author Louis Adamić,Mrs. Roosevelt had promised to ask the President to write to Tesla and said thatshe herself would call on him on her next trip to New York. The second note isheaded, “Memo for Mrs. Roosevelt” and is signed FDR: “I was having this lookedinto but the papers yesterday carried the story that Dr. Tesla had died.Therefore I am returning the enclosures herewith.” A third note of January 11from Eleanor Roosevelt to Admić forwards the President’s message and adds hersorrow at learning of the inventor’s death.Adamić wrote a moving eulogy to Tesla that was read by New York Mayor FiorelloH. LaGuardia over station WNYC on January 10.11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos973860]Meanwhile the extreme tensions between Serb and Croat factions in the UnitedStates were making the planning of funeral services difficult. The body lay instate but, according to an unpublished letter of O’Neill’s, “only twelve people,some of whom were newspaper reporters,” came to view it.When state services were held at four o’clock on January 12, in the Cathedral ofSt. John the Divine, however, more than two thousand people crowded in. Serbsand Croats were seated on opposing sides of the cathedral, Bishop William T.Manning having exacted from both factions a promise of no political speeches.The service was begun in English by Bishop Manning and concluded in Serbian bythe Very Rev. Dusan Sukletović.Among Balkan diplomats present were Ambassador Fotić, the Governor of Croatia, aformer Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, and the Minister of Food andReconstruction. In the front row with Kosanović, chief mourner and head of theimportant new trade mission, sat Swezey. Dr. Rado had been too ill to attend asan honorary pallbearer.Figures important in American science and industry who did attend as honorarypallbearers included Professor Edwin H. Armstrong, Dr. E. F. W. Alexanderson ofGeneral Electric, Dr. Harvey Rentschler of Westinghouse, engineer Gano Dunn, andW. H. Barton, curator of the Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum ofNatural History. Newbold Morris, president of the New York City Council, headedthis group.When word of Tesla’s death spread abroad to war-stricken Europe, telegrams oftribute and sorrow began pouring in from scientists and governmental leadersalike. In the United States three Nobel prizewinners in physics, Millikan,Compton, and James Franck, joined in a eulogy to the inventor as “one of theoutstanding intellects of the world who paved the way for many of the importanttechnological developments of modern times.”The President and Mrs. Roosevelt expressed their gratitude for Tesla’scontributions “to science and industry and to this country.” Vice-PresidentWallace, in the spirit of the new Yugoslavia, declared that, “In Nikola Tesla’sdeath the common man loses one of his best friends.”Although Louis Adamić wrongly eulogized Tesla as one who had cared nothing formoney, he could not have been more accurate when he said that Tesla was notreally dead: “The real, important part of Tesla lives in his achievement, whichis great, almost beyond calculation, and an integral part of our civilization,our daily lives, our current war effort…. His life is a triumph….”12[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos974034]Among the honors that had come to Tesla in his life were many academic degreesfrom American and foreign universities; the John Scott Medal, the Edison Medal,and various awards from European governments. In September 1943 the Liberty shipNikola Tesla was launched, an honor that would have pleased the scientist. Butnot until 1975 was he inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.Eight months after Tesla’s death, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down thedecision that he had been confident would come eventually— ruling that he wasthe inventor of radio.His body was taken to Ferncliffe Cemetery at Ardsley-on-the-Hudson in the deepcold of the winter afternoon. In the car that followed the hearse rode Swezeyand Kosanović. The inventor’s remains were cremated and his ashes later returnedto the land of his birth.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_075.html#filepos1170922]In almost every nation in the world, the fighting and dying continued."},{"pageContent":"29. THE MISSING PAPERS In addition to his acknowledged achievements, Tesla left a legacy of riddles. Topose only three of the most major: Was his unrealized concept for the wirelesstransmission of energy through the Earth scientifically valid? What actually washe doing in his experimentation with death/disintegrator beam weapons? And whatbecame of his unpatented research papers and other sensitive documents in thedays immediately following his death?In the category of subquestions, what turn of affairs rekindled the intenseinterest of the U.S. intelligence establishment in Tesla’s work (as somethingsurely did) in the late 1940s?Like Einstein he had been an outsider and, like Edison, a wide-ranginggeneralist. As he himself had said, he had the “boldness of ignorance.” Whereothers stopped short, aware of what could not be done, he continued. Thesurvival of such mutants and polymaths as Tesla tends to be discouraged bymodern scientific guilds. Whether either he or Edison could have flourished intoday’s milieu is conjectural.The example set by Tesla has always been particularly inspiring to the lonerunner. At the same time, however, his legacy to establishment science isprofound for his research, although sometimes esoteric, was almost alwayssweeping in its potential to transform society. His contribution was majorrather than incremental. His turbine failed in part because it would haverequired fundamental changes by whole industries. Alternating current triumphedonly after it had overcome the resistance of an entire industry.But there was an unfortunate corollary to Tesla’s lone battles with thescientific-industrial establishment. Since he was part of no group orinstitution, he had no colleagues with whom to discuss work in progress, noformal, accessible repository for his research notes and papers. He worked notjust in private, but—his love of flamboyant announcements to the pressnotwithstanding—in secret. Thus any inventions which he did not patent or givefreely to the world were more or less shrouded in mystery. And, because of thehandling of the papers he left behind after his death, the range of hisachievement continues to remain a partial mystery.If this has been frustrating to the scientists who have succeeded Tesla, it hasat least been stimulating. After a period of obscurity, the one hundredthanniversary of his birth in July 1956 brought an international reawakening tothe importance of the inventor’s life and genius. Interest in his work, fired bya growing awareness of the riddles surrounding it, has been escalating eversince, almost as if he had been reborn in his true psychological age.He was honored by centennial celebrations in America and Europe. The AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers dedicated its fall meeting in Chicago to areview of his life and inventions. Commemorative programs were arranged by theInstitute of Radio Engineers, the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry, theFranklin Institute, and various universities, the Tesla Society playing anactive role in such recognition. Permanent memorials in the form of scholarshipsand medals were proposed and exhibits presented by science museums. Specialceremonies were conducted at Niagara Falls, and a statue was later erected inhis honor on Goat Island, a gift from the people of Yugoslavia. Chicago,reminded by attorney/author Elmer Gertz that it should be eternally grateful tohim for having made the Columbian Exposition of 1893 the “wonder of the globe,”dedicated a new public school to Tesla’s memory.The inventor’s old colleagues of the AIEE journeyed to Europe to attend morecelebrations, statue unveilings, and dedications in his honor. The InternationalElectrotechnical Commission in Munich took formal action, making his name aninternational scientific unit, the tesla joining such historic electricalsymbols as farad, volt, ampere, and ohm.1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos974320]As the exploration of space accelerated, so did interest in Tesla, especiallyfrom the standpoint of beam weaponry and microwave work. In America, Russia,Canada, and various other countries, projects in his name or derived from hispioneering, from weather-control to nuclear fusion, began to attract scientificattention. Some were just the shoestring efforts of loners, their laboratoriesold Quonset huts. Some were top secret and financed by enormous budgets.Tesla’s year of secret experiments at Colorado Springs in 1899 provided thebasic impetus for much of this new exploration. His Colorado Springs Notes, whenthey appeared in English in 1978 under the imprint of the Tesla Museum atBelgrade, were eagerly awaited by many scientists. But even this work leftimportant questions unanswered.The bulk of his papers having vanished from America, reliable information washarder to come by than the recurring rumors of conspiracy, espionage, and patenttheft. Scientists thought it strange that some aspects of his Colorado Springsresearch found in scattered sources did not appear in the Yugoslav-publishedNotes. Only by piecing together fragmentary information could the magnitude ofhis experiments be comprehended.Around 1928 O’Neill, by merest chance, had happened to see a legal advertisementin a New York newspaper announcing that six boxes placed in storage by NikolaTesla would be sold by the storage warehouse for unpaid bills. Feeling that suchmaterial should be preserved, he went to the inventor and asked permission totry to obtain funds to reclaim the material.“Tesla hit the ceiling,” he recalled. “He assured me he was well able to takecare of his own affairs…. He forbid me to buy them or do anything in any wayabout them.”Shortly after the inventor died, O’Neill got in touch with Sava Kosanović, toldhim about the boxes, and urged him to protect them. He was never able to get apositive statement from Kosanović that he had obtained the boxes and examinedthe contents. “He gave evasive assurances that there was no reason for me toworry….”Others too were interested in the papers. A young American engineer engaged inwar work consulted Tesla on a ballistics engineering problem because he couldnot get time on an overworked computer, and Tesla’s mind was known to offer thenearest thing to it. Soon he became fascinated with Tesla’s scientific papersand was allowed to take batches of them home to his hotel room where he andanother American engineer pored over them each night. They were returned thenext day, a procedure which continued for about two weeks prior to theinventor’s death.Tesla had received offers to work for Germany and Russia. After the inventordied, both engineers became concerned that critical scientific information mightfall into foreign hands and alerted United States security agencies and highgovernment officials.The relevant records that I have obtained from federal agencies under theFreedom of Information Act reveal strange twistings and inconsistencies in thehandling of the inventor’s estate. Tesla left tons of papers, barrels and boxesfull of them. But he left no will. He was survived by five nieces and nephews,of whom two lived in America at the time of his death.Curiously, the FBI released his estate to the Office of Alien Property, whichpromptly sealed the contents. Since Tesla was an American citizen, the OAP’sconcern in the matter was hard to justify. After a court hearing, however, theestate was released to Ambassador Kosanović, one of the heirs.Swezey, who also had hoped to write a biography of Tesla (his death intervened),received the following account in 1963 from a former aide of AmbassadorKosanović’s:“Back in 1943… when Tesla died, it was a matter of very short time when Mr. Kwas issued a certificate from or by the Office of Custodian of Alien Propertyconveying to Mr. K full rights to the Tesla papers…. he had them all packed upand sent off to the Manhattan Storage Company where they remained until readyfor packing and shipping off to Yugoslavia in 1952. Mr. K paid for storagecharges. . . . All this time the certificate from the Alien Property Office wasin my possession (in case of need). . . .“You will perhaps remember that a number of times Mr. K mentioned the fact thatthe custodian at the storage warehouse told him that some government guys werein to microfilm some of the papers. . . . when we opened the safe in the presentmuseum building (in Belgrade, Yugoslavia) the bunch of keys, which was the lastthing Mr. K. flung into the safe at the New Yorker Hotel before the combinationwas re-set to a new combination, were not found in the safe, but in an entirelydifferent box. Also the gold medal (the Edison Medal) was missing from thesafe…. Anyway, for years and years Mr. K was bothered by the fact that Teslapapers had been gone thru and just before his departure from Washington in1949–50(?) he decided to follow my suggestion to call Edgar J. Hoover [sic] andask him. Mr. Hoover denied categorically that the FBI had gone into thepapers….”The aide said Tesla had told his nephew that “he wished to leave his works,property, etc., to his native country.” (Not only is this uncorroborated but thepapers were in English.)Immediately after Tesla’s death an exchange of telegrams flew between FBI AgentFoxworth of the field division of the New York Bureau and the director of theNew York Bureau of the FBI. The day following discovery of the body, AgentFoxworth reported:“Experiments and research of Nikola Tesla, deceased. Espionage— M. Nikola Tesla,one of the world’s outstanding scientists in the electrical field, died Januaryseventh, nineteen forty-three at the Hotel New Yorker, New York City. During hislifetime, he conducted many experiments in connection with the wirelesstransmission of electrical power and… what is commonly called the death ray.According to information furnished by X [name deleted], New York City, the notesand records of Tesla’s experiments and formulae together with designs ofmachinery . . . are among Tesla’s personal effects, and no steps have been takento preserve them or to keep them from falling into hands of people . . .unfriendly to the war effort of the United Nations. . . .” (The FBI was,however, advised by the office of Vice-President Henry A. Wallace that thegovernment was “vitally interested” in preserving Tesla’s papers.)Bloyce D. Fitzgerald, “an electrical engineer who had been quite close to Tesladuring his lifetime,” continued Foxworth, “advised the New York office that onJanuary seventh, nineteen forty-three, Sava Kosanović, George Clark, who is incharge of the museum and laboratory for RCA, and Kenneth Swezey . . . went toTesla’s rooms in the New Yorker [author’s note: the correct date would have beenJanuary 8], and with the assistance of a locksmith broke into a safe which Teslahad in his rooms in which he kept some of his valuable papers. . . . Within thelast month, Tesla told Fitzgerald that his experiments in connection with thewireless transmission of electrical power had been completed and perfected.“Fitzgerald also knows that Tesla had conceived and designed a revolutionarytype of torpedo which is not presently in use by any of the nations. It isFitzgerald’s belief that this design has not been made available to any nationup to the present time. From statements made to Fitzgerald by Tesla, he knowsthat the complete plans, specifications and explanation of the basic theories ofthese things are some place in the personal effects of Tesla. He also knowsthere is a working model of Tesla’s, which cost more than ten thousand dollarsto build, in a safety deposit box belonging to Tesla at the Governor ClintonHotel, and Fitzgerald believes this model has to do with the so-called death rayor the wireless transmission of electrical current.“Tesla has also told Fitzgerald in past conversations that he has some eightytrunks in different places containing transcripts and plans having to do withexperiments conducted by him. Bureau is requested to advise immediately what, ifany, action should be taken concerning this matter by the New York FieldDivision.”2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos974580]Kosanović later reported to Walter Gorsuch of the Office of Alien Property inNew York that he first went to Tesla’s rooms with the other men to search for awill. After the safe was opened, Swezey took from it a book containing thetestimonials sent to Tesla on his seventy-fifth birthday, while Kosanović tookfrom the room three pictures of Tesla. According to the manager of the NewYorker Hotel and Kosanović, nothing else was removed. The safe was closed undera new combination, which combination was in Kosanović’s exclusive possession.On January 9, Gorsuch of OAP and Fitzgerald went to the New Yorker Hotel andseized all of Tesla’s property, consisting of about two truckloads of material,sealed it and transferred it to the Manhattan Storage and Warehouse Company. Itwas added to about thirty barrels and bundles that had been there since about1934, and these too were sealed under orders of the OAP.In addition to the question of the legitimacy of Alien Property’s involvement inthe case is the question of why Kosanović was allowed to have access to thesafe’s combination, from which he later claimed the Edison Medal had vanished.Tesla’s American naturalization papers, which he so prized that he always keptthem in his safe, may now be seen at the Tesla Museum in Belgrade; but it is notknown what other papers or objects were in the safe.The Washington Bureau of the FBI went so far as to advise the New York Bureau“to discreetly take the matter up with the State’s Attorney in New York Citywith the view to possibly taking Kosanovich into custody on a burglary chargeand obtaining the various papers which Kosanovich is reported to have taken fromTesla’s safe.” New York was also told to contact the Surrogate Court so stopscould be placed against all of Tesla’s effects, so that no one could enter themwithout an FBI agent being present, and New York was to keep Washington advisedof all developments.3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos974792]The idea of arresting the Yugoslav ambassador was quickly dropped. And very soonthe Washington headquarters made a curious decision. Edward A. Tamm of the FBIin Washington advised D. M. Ladd of that Bureau that the whole matter was beingturned over to the Custodian of Alien Property; and Tamm noted, “There appearsto be no need for us to mess around in it.”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos974985]Soon the well-known electrical engineer Dr. John G. Trump, who was serving as atechnical aide to the National Defense Research Committee of the Office ofScientific Research and Development, was asked to participate in an examinationof Tesla’s scientific papers. Present at the Manhattan Warehouse & StorageCompany in addition to Dr. Trump were Willis George, Office of NavalIntelligence, Third Naval District, Edward Palmer, chief yeoman, USNR, and JohnJ. Corbett, chief yeoman, USNR.Dr. Trump reported afterward that no examination was made of the vast amount ofTesla’s property that had been in the basement of the New Yorker Hotel for tenyears prior to his death, or of any of his papers except those in his immediatepossession at the time of death. It should be remembered that Tesla’s scientificreputation had been in eclipse for a number of years and that there had beenmany efforts to discredit his claims in radio, robotry, and alternating current.Dr. Trump was a busy man, just as the staff of the FBI was stretched thin by itspreoccupation with investigating wartime sabotage.“As a result of this examination,” wrote Dr. Trump, “it is my considered opinionthat there exist among Dr. Tesla’s papers and possessions no scientific notes,descriptions of hitherto unrevealed methods or devices, or actual apparatuswhich could be of significant value to this country or which would constitute ahazard in unfriendly hands. I can therefore see no technical or military reasonwhy further custody of the property should be retained.”He added: “For your records, there has been removed to your office a file ofvarious written material by Dr. Tesla which covers typically and fairlycompletely the ideas with which he was concerned during his later years. Thesedocuments are enumerated and briefly abstracted in the attachment to thisletter.”In closing Dr. Trump said: “It should be no discredit to this distinguishedengineer and scientist, whose solid contributions to the electrical art weremade at the beginning of the present century, to report that his thoughts andefforts during at least the past fifteen years were primarily of a speculative,philosophical, and somewhat promotional character—often concerned with theproduction and wireless transmission of power—but did not include new sound,workable principles or methods for realizing such results.”The file (of which Dr. Trump’s notes were only an abstract) consisted apparentlyof either photostats or microfilm made by the naval officers present, and theoriginal papers apparently remained in storage, later to be transmitted toYugoslavia. The examination had failed to disclose any alien-owned propertysubject to the vesting power of the Alien Property Custodian under the Tradingwith the Enemy Act. Tesla’s papers and personal effects were released inFebruary of 1943 for disposition by Kosanović, the administrator of his estate.Dr. Trump’s abstract included the following:“Art of Telegeodynamics, or Art of Producing Terrestrial Motions atDistance—This document, in the form of a letter dated June 12, 1940, to theWestinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co., proposes a method for thetransmission of large amounts of power over vast distances by means ofmechanical vibrations of the earth’s crust. The source of power is a mechanicalor electromechanical device bolted to some rocky protuberance and impartingpower at a resonance frequency of the earth’s crust. The proposed scheme appearsto be completely visionary and unworkable. Westinghouse’s reply indicates theirpolite rejection….“New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-Dispersive Energy through NaturalMedia—This undated document by Tesla describes an electrostatic method ofproducing very high voltages and capable of very great power. This generator isused to accelerate charged particles, presumably electrons. Such a beam ofhigh-energy electrons passing through air is the ‘concentrated nondispersive’means by which energy is transmitted through natural media. As a component ofthis apparatus there is described an open-ended vacuum tube within which theelectrons are first accelerated.“The proposed scheme bears some relation to present means for producinghigh-energy cathode rays by the cooperative use of a high-voltage electrostaticgenerator and an evacuated electron acceleration tube. It is well known,however, that such devices, while of scientific and medical interest, areincapable of the transmission of large amounts of power in nondispersed beamsover long distances. Tesla’s disclosures in this memorandum would not enable theconstruction of workable combinations of generator and tube even of limitedpower, though the general elements of such a combination are succinctlydescribed.“A Method of Producing Powerful Radiations—an undated memorandum in Tesla’shandwriting describing ‘a new process of generating powerful rays orradiations.’ This memorandum reviews the works of Lenard and Crookes, describesTesla’s work on the production of high voltages, and finally in the lastparagraph gives the only description of the invention contained in thememorandum. . . . ‘Briefly stated, my new simplified process of generatingpowerful rays consists in creating through the medium of a high-speed jet ofsuitable fluid a vacuous space around a terminal of a circuit and supplying thesame with currents of the required tension and volume.’”Long afterward in a letter to a colleague, Dr. Trump told what happened when hevisited the Hotel Governor Clinton to examine the “device” stored in its vault,presumably the same box remembered by the messenger boy in Tesla’s room.“Tesla had warned the management that this ‘device’ was a secret weapon,” saidDr. Trump, “and it would detonate if opened by an unauthorized person. Uponopening the vault and indicating the package containing the secret weapon, thehotel manager and employees promptly left the scene.” The federal agents who hadcome along also pulled back, the better to give him the sole distinction ofopening the parcel.It was wrapped in brown paper and tied with a string. He remembered hesitating,thinking how beautiful the weather was outdoors, and pondering on why he was notoutside too.He lifted the parcel onto a table and, mustering his courage, snipped the stringwith his pocket knife. He removed the wrapping. Inside was a handsome polishedwooden chest bound with brass. It required a final effort of courage to raisethe hinged lid.Inside stood a multidecade resistance box of the type used for Wheatstone bridgeresistance measurements—a common standard item to be found in every electricallaboratory before the turn of the century!Why had Tesla seen fit to terrify the staff and management of the hotel withthis harmless object for so many years? Perhaps he had become so accustomed tohaving his hotel bills paid behind his back (believing that the hotels, honoredto have him living there, had routinely dismissed the billings), that he wasinsulted when the Governor Clinton brashly demanded its $400.Although the FBI closed its Tesla file in 1943, it didn’t seem to want to stayclosed. It was reopened in 1957 when an informant complained that a New Yorkcouple were issuing newsletters containing “information pertaining to flyingsaucers and interplanetary matters” and exploiting the inventor’s name and fame.They allegedly claimed that Tesla’s engineers, after his death, had completed a“Tesla Set,” a radio device for interplanetary communication, that the devicehad been placed in operation in 1950 and since then Tesla engineers had been inclose touch with alien spaceships. Once again the FBI decided no action waswarranted and the file was closed.Swezey had never put much credence in the “secret weapon” rumors and had writtento an inquirer: “Because Tesla was a recluse, and himself liked to talk inmystifying terms during his later years, I think many legends have been built upabout the dozens of ideas he had evolved but which were not permitted by othersto see the light of day.”He said he had known the inventor well for two decades before his death:“Tesla’s greatest genius flamed up during a dozen or so years just before andslightly after the turn of the century. What he did after that may have carriedthe germs of some of the developments we are witnessing today, but he had notcarried any of them—at least on paper or in any other tangible form—to the pointof practicality….”Perhaps, but between 1945 and 1947 an interesting exchange of letters and cablesoccurred among the Air Technical Service Command at Wright Field, Ohio, in whoseEquipment Laboratory much top-secret research was being performed, MilitaryIntelligence in Washington, and the Office of Alien Property—subject, files ofthe late Nikola Tesla.On August 21, 1945, the Air Technical Service Command requested permission fromthe commanding general of the U.S. Army Air Force in Washington, D.C., forPrivate Bloyce D. Fitzgerald to go to Washington for a period of seven days “forthe purpose of securing property clearance on enemy impounded property.”On September 5, 1945, Colonel Holliday of the Equipment Laboratory, Propulsionand Accessories Subdivision, wrote to Lloyd L. Shaulis of the OAP in Washington,confirming a conversation with Fitzgerald and asking for photostatic copies ofthe exhibits annotated by Trump from the estate of Tesla. It was stated that thematerial would be used “in connection with projects for National Defense by thisdepartment,” and that all of it would be returned in a reasonable length oftime.That was the last time that the Office of Alien Property or any other federalagency in the United States admitted to having possession of Tesla’s papers onbeam weaponry. Shaulis wrote to Colonel Holliday on September 11, 1945, saying,“The materials requested have been forwarded to Air Technical Service Command incare of Lt. Robert E. Houle. These data are made available to the Army Air Forceby this office for use in experiments; please return them.” They were neverreturned.These were the full photostatic copies, not merely the abstracts. OAP has norecord of how many copies were made by those who examined the files with Dr.Trump. The Navy has no record of Tesla’s papers; no federal archives have arecord of them.Curiously, four months after the photostats had been sent to Wright Field, Col.Ralph Doty, the chief of Military Intelligence in Washington wrote James Markhamof Alien Property indicating that they had never been received: “This office isin receipt of a communication from Headquarters, Air Technical Service Command,Wright Field, requesting that we ascertain the whereabouts of the files of thelate scientist, Dr. Nichola [sic] Tesla, which may contain data of great valueto the above Headquarters. It has been indicated that your office might havethese files in custody. If this is true, we would like to request your consentfor a representative of the Air Technical Service Command to review them. Inview of the extreme importance of these files to the above command, we wouldlike to request that we be advised of any attempt by any other agency to obtainthem. [Italics supplied.]“Because of the urgency of this matter, this communication will be delivered toyou by a Liaison Officer of this office in the hope of expediting the solicitedinformation.”The “other” agency that had the files, or should have had them, was the AirTechnical Service Command itself! Colonel Doty’s letter, which was classifiedunder the Espionage Act, was declassified on May 8, 1980.This embarrassing contretemps goes unexplained in the records. Perhaps it washandled orally with the Liaison Officer.However, on October 24, 1947, David L. Bazelon, assistant attorney general anddirector of the Office of Alien Property, wrote to the commanding officer of theAir Technical Service Command, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, regarding the Teslaphotostats that had been sent by registered mail on or about September 11, 1945,to Colonel Holliday, at the latter’s request.“Our records do not reveal that this material has been returned,” said Bazelon.He sent a description and asked that it be returned.Obviously at least one set of Tesla’s papers had reached Wright Field because onNovember 25, 1947, there was a response to the Office of Alien Property fromColonel Duffy, chief of the Electronic Plans Section, Electronic Subdivision,Engineering Division, Air Matériel Command, Wright Field. He replied: “Thesereports are now in the possession of the Electronic Subdivision and are beingevaluated.” He believed that the evaluation should be completed by January 1,1948, and “At that time your office will be contacted with respect to finaldisposition of these papers.”There is no written record that OAP ever sought further to have the documentsreturned, and they were not returned.For many years there have been rumors that these unpatented inventions orconcepts of Tesla’s found their way not only to the U.S. Army Air Force but toRussia and to private American defense industries, and ultimately into certainuniversity research laboratories engaged in beam weaponry.The Office of Alien Property experienced a very difficult problem over the yearsin explaining its role in connection with Tesla’s papers. Between 1948 and 1978it issued the following variations on a theme to many inquirers:“While this Office participated in an examination of certain material owned bythe late Dr. Tesla, our records do not disclose that any such material has beenvested or is presently under the jurisdiction of this Office….”“This Office has never had custody . . . of any property of Nikola Tesla….”“While the Tesla papers were in our custody…”“Photostatic copies of certain documents, made while the papers were under ourseal….”“In 1943 this Office placed a seal on the property….”“While the Tesla papers were in our custody . . .” etc., etc., etc.As for what is now Headquarters Aeronautical Systems Division, Wright-PattersonAir Force Base, Ohio, they state: “The organization (Equipment Laboratory) thatperformed the evaluation of Tesla’s papers was deactivated several years ago.After conducting an extensive search of lists of records retired by thatorganization, in which we found no mention of Tesla’s papers, we concluded thedocuments were destroyed at the time the laboratory was deactivated.”5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos975187](Italics supplied. Response, under the Freedom of Information Act, dated July30, 1980.)Tesla’s original papers, and the remaining models of his inventions— hismagnifying transmitter, robot boats, early tube lighting, induction motors,turbine, exhibits shown at the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893, such as the “Egg ofColumbus,” and others—left America in 1952 for Yugoslavia. His ashes were sentlater. The artifacts may now be seen at the Tesla Museum in Belgrade, adignified-looking building with a broad, well-proportioned facade at No. 51Proleterskih Brigada, an avenue renamed after the war, but formerly known underthe monarchy as Crown Street. The museum bears a plaque on a low wall, printedin the old Cyrillic alphabet.Here Tesla’s English writings have been translated into SerboCroatian—except, asthe archivist admits, for the “unimportant” material, which remains, just as hewrote it, in the language of his adopted country."},{"pageContent":"30. THE LEGACY The fact that Tesla’s research notes and papers have not been easily availablefor western scientists has not, of course, meant that Teslian research is dead.On the contrary, the very mystery surrounding some of his unproved claims hasserved to goad numerous scientists into trying to duplicate his experiments. Andsince his aspirations were virtually limitless, there has always been a chancethat the rewards of success would not be inconsiderable. But the single greateststimulus to try to follow in Tesla’s footsteps doubtless remains the example ofthe man himself—his stunning record of achievement and the enduring fascinationof his mind. As one admiring German writer put it, “Tesla went beyond theborders of his exact science to foretell what lies in the future . . . a modernPrometheus who dared reach for the stars….”1[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos975570]Although a comprehensive summary of the state of Tesla-inspired research todaywould be beyond either the scope of this book or the intent of its author, noaccount of the inventor’s life would be complete without at least someindication of what has become of a few of his major preoccupations. The record,as one might expect, is both mixed and incomplete, but it is no less impressivefor that.To begin, then, with Tesla’s experiments with ball lightning: He had no ideawhat ball lightning might be useful for when he first encountered it in hisColorado Springs research; to him it was a nuisance, but it demanded anexplanation. And so he set about determining the mode of formation of thestrange fireballs and learned to produce them artificially.The technical explanation runs like this: In the highly resonant transformersecondary comprising his magnifying transmitter, the entire energy accumulatedin the excited circuit, instead of requiring a quarter period for transformationfrom static to kinetic, could spend itself in less time, at hundreds ofthousands of horsepower. Thus, for example, Tesla produced artificial fireballsby suddenly causing the impressed oscillations to be more rapid than free onesof the secondary. This shifted the point of maximum electrical pressure belowthe elevated terminal capacity, and a ball of fire would leap great distances.Yet strangely enough, modern plasma physicists with the best-equippedlaboratories, have failed to produce plasmoids with anything near the stabilityof the true ball-lightning spheres that he created.Why the fascination with this problem? First, of course, because it is there, anunknown. But second because among other uses, it may hold a vital key in theinternational race to achieve controlled nuclear fusion—potentially the greatestpower source in history. Among those long interested in ball-lightning researchhave been Peter Kapitza, the great Russian physicist, Lambert Dolphin and hiscolleagues in the radio physics laboratory at SRI International, Dr. Robert W.Bass of Brigham Young University, and Robert Golka, with whom Bass hascollaborated on research.Golka, a Massachusetts physicist, Tesla disciple, and lightning experimenter,has pursued the ephemeral fireball with the fervor of a hunter of snarks. LikeTesla in Colorado, he has done his research alone in a remote western laboratoryin the Utah salt flats, and like Tesla, he has struggled to win the kind offederal support that usually goes only to enormous institutions or corporations.In the largest hangar at the far end of the ghost base at Wendover, Utah, whichwas built by the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II, big spotlights areoften burning as Golka conducts lightning tests. Here, under tightest securityin the 1940s, the B-29 Enola Gay was housed and outfitted for delivering thefirst atomic bombs to Hiroshima.Golka made two trips to the Tesla Museum to pore over the inventor’s thenunpublished notes and concentrated on replicating as exactly as he could in theold air base hangar the magnifying transmitter that Tesla had built in 1899 wheninvestigating the lightning storms of Pike’s Peak.“He [Tesla] was ‘way ahead of anything we have today in the equipment he built,”Golka says. “Such as the high-powered switches and spark gap switches. Theknowledge has been lost; we don’t know how he did it. Some of it was in thediaries, but he kept much of this stuff in his head.”Golka built a magnifying transmitter at his “Project Tesla” that would discharge22 million volts, creating almost twice as powerful a chain-lightning storm asthe maestro himself had produced at Colorado Springs.The relevance of ball lightning to fusion research has to do with the problem ofconfining plasma. The heart of the most common type of experimental fusionreaction involves taking isotopic hydrogen gas and both accelerating andsuperheating it until the hydrogen nuclei fuse to make helium nuclei, releasing,in the process, staggering amounts of energy. Along the way, while the hydrogenis being charged with vast amounts of kinetic and thermal energy, it enters animperfectly understood material state known as plasma.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_076.html#filepos1171399] In thepenultimate stages of the process, before fusion begins, the besetting problemis to maintain the plasma’s coherence, to confine it within some kind ofinvisible electromagnetic “bottle.”†[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_077.html#filepos1171879]Since the strongest geometric shape is a sphere, Golka believes that balllightning offers the best potential for containment of the unstable mass. Hedescribes the odd lightning as “a glowing sphere of a variety of colors, ahalf-inch in diameter or as big as a grapefruit,” and resembling an onion in its“layers and layers of alternate charged particles, positive and negative.” Itmay bounce along through buildings, fall into water and set it boiling; andsometimes, as at the Hill Air Force Base in Utah, it may knock out the mostsophisticated electronic equipment. In the summer of 1978, with the use of CO2laser beams, he finally managed to produce “bead” lightning, which he believesto be a form of ball lightning, and to photograph it in sequential frames.2[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos975853]He then sought support from the U.S. Department of Energy for a major program ofresearch for which he proposed to use a device called a pyrosphere, employingfive laser beams to create thermonuclear fusion. In a “Fireball Fusion Reactor”only nonradioactive helium is created and, according to Golka, mathematicalmodels indicate it can reach and hold temperatures above a billion degrees.He also proposed to the Air Force another Teslian concept, a charged particlebeam, but again one designed to employ laser technology. Such beam guns, hebelieves, would have a range of 6,000 miles and could melt and destroy ICBM-typemissiles in the air. With a Tesla coil three times the size of his combinedcoils, Golka believed he could generate 200 million volts of electricity.But he inherited the usual Teslian problems of a loner, and as he said, “Thewalls fall in on me when I work for corporations.” His work reached a pointwhere it could no longer progress with improvised equipment, but called forenormous investments. His competitors were large corporations and leadinguniversities engaged in the nuclear-fusion race; and even some of the latterwere being cut off from their federal grants. They too were deeply into lasertechnology, although Golka claims his system is different and unique. By nomeans the only scientist to have attempted to carry forward Tesla’s work withball lightning, he undoubtedly has been one of the most singleminded.*[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_078.html#filepos1172282]Russia’s Kapitza, who shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in physics with Arno Penziasand Robert W. Wilson of America for his work in magnetism and the behavior ofmatter at extremely low temperatures, acknowledges his debt to Tesla. “Theefficient generation of super-high-frequency oscillations and their conversionback to direct-current electrical energy,” he writes, “discloses possiblesolutions to the problem of transmitting electrical energy… in free space. Thetransmission setup will, of course, be similar to that already considered but,instead of a wave guide, a highly directional beam must be used, which, as iswell-known, only at short wavelengths will diverge little. Such a setup for thetransmission of electrical energy, firstly thought by N. Tesla many years ago,has already been discussed. . . . Although . . . possible in principle, it istied up with the solution of a series of complicated engineering problems andtherefore it can be implemented in practice only in such special situations inwhich other methods of energy transmission are inapplicable (for example, whenenergy must be supplied to a satellite).”3[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos976515]In this field of wireless energy transmission, so directly concerned with thespace race, there is progress nearer home. Richard Dickinson, who heads theMicrowave Power Transmission project for Cal Tech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory inthe desert near Barstow, California, traces his inspiration to the early work ofTesla. The concept of bringing electricity to Earth from an orbiting solar-powersystem via microwaves is daring, costly, romantic, and thoroughly in the styleof the maestro.“We beamed power from our transmitter at Goldstone a distance of one mile,”Dickinson said of the NASA project initiated in the mid-seventies. “All of themicrowave energy that fell within our target (of which we could only collect aportion with our existing apparatus), we converted 82.5 percent to useful directcurrent. Thirty-four thousand watts of direct current output carried a distanceof one mile. We are well pleased. The next step is to look further into thetechnology and needs of the satellite power system of the future.”4[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos977051]William C. Brown of the Raytheon Company, who developed the rectenna used inthis microwave-power research, also attributes the idea of sending electricityby radio waves to Tesla’s pioneering in the fundamentals of radio broadcastingand wireless power transmission.Theoretically, a city the size of New York could be supplied with five billionwatts on a winter day by enormous satellite structures in the sky that wouldorbit synchronously with Earth at a height of 22,300 miles. But admittedly, thecost of such floating power stations would be many billions of dollars, and theywould be highly vulnerable to enemy killer satellites in the event of war.Brookhaven National Laboratory, located just to the northeast of Tesla’s oldWardenclyffe site at Shoreham, also feels a close link with the inventor throughthe advanced high-energy work being conducted at the laboratory. In 1976 it paidhomage to him in a ceremony, and the Yugoslav government sent a plaque to beplaced at the still-standing Wardenclyffe laboratory.Canada, too, has long been a bastion of Tesla Energy System advocates, andbecause of the country’s rich hydroelectric sources, through-the-Earthtransmission—if it worked—could be a boon to areas of power shortage.But—will it work? Several projects have been planned, and some partiallyimplemented, in Canada, central Minnesota, and most recently in SouthernCalifornia—to “pump” hydroelectric power wirelessly through the Earth to an areaof need, employing the Tesla system as it is understood.5[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos977349] TheU.S. Department of Energy has often been asked to fund projects based on Tesla’ssystem.Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the system ever worked for Tesla, andnone that it could work for anyone else. One of the inventor’s problems was thathe improperly extended into the electromagnetic domain fluid andfluid-mechanical analogies. Tesla’s patent No. 787,412 provides for the Earth tobe excited by a carefully valued wavelength to establish a standing wavecondition. Tesla believed the propagation path fell along a diameter. Butaccording to much knowledge developed since 1899, the propagation path would notbe along a diameter but, rather, along an ellipsoidal arc somewhere between thediameter and the spherical surface.A fundamental aspect of wave propagation of power is that no power istransmitted if the wave is standing; power is transmitted solely with atraveling component. Boundary layer propagation, i.e., the mode of losslesspropagation of waves at the boundary of two differing media (such as earth andsky), is a viable concept. However, the boundary plane must be smooth and thewaves must be properly launched. At the frequencies Tesla was using, suchlaunching apparatus would be an enormous structure. In examining the photographsof his experimental station at Colorado Springs, it is apparent to experts thathe did not employ apparatus essential to the launching of such waves.Tesla probably was mistaken at Colorado Springs in his interpretation of thelightning storms which he observed traveling away from him (eastwardly) acrossthe plains, producing maxima and minima effects upon his instruments. This heinterpreted as standing waves being set up in the Earth by the traveling storm,with the crests of the waves passing through his location as the stormsadvanced. It is believed he was seeing an interference effect caused by thereradiating surface of the frontal range of mountains to the east of hisstation. The results would have been the same on his instruments.Dr. Wait, formerly senior scientist at the Environmental Research Laboratories,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in Colorado, describes himselfas a “firm skeptic” of the Tesla theory. “The concept that electromagneticenergy penetrates ‘through the earth,’” he says, “is valid only if the frequencyis sufficiently low and if the distances are small. It’s all tied up with‘skin-effect’ phenomena; that means that the field is confined to the surface ofa good conductor as in metallic wave guide.”6[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos977798]Dr. Wait even goes so far as to suggest that Tesla never really accepted thefact that electromagnetic waves could transport energy through the air. “Insteadhe thought of the earth itself as a conveyor and also thought of the possibilityof a return conductor at heights of ‘15 miles above sea level.’ The parallel ofthis idea to the earth-ionosphere wave guide at extremely low frequencies isstriking (see IEEE Journals of Oceanic Engineering, Vol. OE-2, No. 2, April1977). Also his proposed resonance of the system might be interpreted as thefirst disclosure of the earth-ionosphere cavity oscillations that have beenassociated from the early 1960s with W. O. Schumann, N. Christofilos, and J.Galejs, among others.”7[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos977971]With respect to wireless communication, the U.S. Navy’s ProjectSanguine/Seafarer of recent years has evolved from Tesla’s Colorado experiments.In a thermonuclear war, conventional radio communication probably would bedisrupted at certain heights and wavelengths. America’s atomic submarine fleetmight then be without a means of receiving messages. The U.S. Navy, seeing thisdanger, turned back to Tesla’s nineteenth-century suggestion of employing 10 Hzsignals (ELF or extra-low frequency), to circle the globe and penetrate thedeepest waters.One of the headier speculations concerning Teslian science is a suggestion thatRussia has been employing his theories on weather modification to interfere withthe jet stream, causing droughts and extremes of hot and cold weather. Howeverunlikely the charge, it is true that Tesla did do a good deal of theorizing (butvery little experimentation) on weather control.He wrote, for example, on the possible use of radio-controlled missiles andexplosives to break up tornadoes and the use of “lightning of a certain kind” totrigger rainfall. Of the former he said, “It would not be difficult to providespecial automata for this purpose, carrying explosive charges, liquid air orother gas, which could be put into action, automatically or otherwise, and whichwould create a sudden pressure or suction, breaking up the whirl. The missilesthemselves might be made of material capable of spontaneous ignition.” Hisproposal included a lengthy mathematical formula.8[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos978182]As with much modern scientific exploration inspired by the maestro, the returnsare still not in on weather changing. Scientist Frederic Jueneman, “InnovativeNotebook” columnist for Industrial Research magazine, calls attention to thefact that Dr. Robert Helliwell and John Katsufrakis of Stanford University’sRadio Science Laboratory, demonstrated that very low frequency radio waves cancause oscillations in the magnetosphere. With a 20-km antenna and a 5 kHztransmitter in the Antarctic, they found that the earth’s magnetosphere could bemodulated to cause high-energy particles to cascade into our atmosphere, and byturning the signal on or off they could start or stop the energy flow.“The theoretical implication suggested by their work,” says Jueneman, “is thatglobal weather control can be attained by the injection of relatively small‘signals’ into the Van Allen belts—something like a super-transistor effect.”But Jueneman’s speculations go further and are eminently worthy of Tesla: “IfTesla’s resonance effects, as shown by the Stanford team, can control enormousenergies by miniscule triggering signals, then by an extension of this principlewe should be able to affect the field environment of the very stars in the sky.. . . With godlike arrogance, we someday may yet direct the stars in theircourses.”9[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos978546]No biography of Tesla would be complete without mention of his bright followingof amateur physicists who build Tesla coils for their personal research,endeavoring to replicate his electrical magic, and the young inventors who poreover his basic patents and still find inspiration from them.Durlin C. Cox, a Wisconsin physicist who has pondered Tesla’s publishedwritings, has built two Tesla coils, the second of 10 million volts. Thereasons: “My own personal interest in high voltage engineering, especially inthe field of high frequency rf transformers; to further my studies on thelaboratory production of ball lightning; and because the University of Wisconsinat Madison asked me to submit a Tesla coil in their bi-annual EngineeringExposition in the spring of 1981.” He and friends built one Tesla coil for aHollywood studio for lightning effects, which has been a common use of them.Electrical engineer Leland Anderson has summarized the major points in designthat a coil builder might gain from reading Tesla’s Colorado Springs Notes:1. The Q’s of the primary and secondary must be as high as practicable.2. The Q’s of the primary and secondary should be equal.3. The length of the secondary winding should be one-quarter of the effectiveoperating wavelength.4. The technique of using an “extra coil” tank circuit (or a variation of it) inthe secondary to magnify the voltage should be used. “With these criteria inmind,” he says, “the builder will find that hundreds of turns are not necessaryfor the secondary winding to achieve high voltages.”Last but not least, what about Tesla’s death/disintegrator rays? Were hisconcepts sound? If they were found useful by the U.S. Army Air Force researchteam, whose top-secret project was rumored to have had the code name “ProjectNick,” it may be safely assumed that instead of being “destroyed,” as reported,his papers are still highly classified.Dr. Trump’s evaluation and Swezey’s assessment of Tesla’s “secret weapons” have,however, received updated concurrence by Lambert Dolphin, assistant director ofthe Radio Physics Laboratory at SRI International, who has studied theinventor’s work and his ball-lightning research for two decades. He points outthat the fields of knowledge of both physics and electrical engineering havegrown exponentially since about 1930.“Whole libraries are now required just to keep track of all the theory andexperience that have unfolded since Tesla’s time,” he says. “Our mathematicaland practical understanding of electricity, magnetism, electromagnetic theory,and radio communications has continued to grow explosively ever since 1950, orshould I say 1970!”Tesla, Dolphin believes, “may have had intuitive insight into lasers andhigh-energy particle beams as well as ultra-high voltage phenomena, but now thatwe understand all the physics much more, we can easily evaluate many of hisextravagant later-life claims.”10[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos978766]In fact, there is no good evidence to suggest that Tesla anticipated lasers. His“teleforce rays” seem to have been concerned exclusively with high-energyparticle beams. We still do not know precisely how he intended them to work,although, says Dolphin, the available evidence suggests that Tesla may not havepaid sufficient attention to how greatly such beams may be absorbed or dispersedby molecules and atoms in the air. In any case, even if we did understandTesla’s intentions more clearly, we should be hard put to compare them to thecurrent state of the art, much of which is hidden under high securityclassifications.Nevertheless, Tesla’s work with high voltages to accelerate charged particlesdoes seem to have been decidedly in what is now the mainstream of physicalresearch. “In this field,” says Dolphin, “he anticipated modern linear andcircular nuclear accelerators. Such machines today have energy levels of tens ofbillions of electron volts or at least 1,000 times greater energy levels thanTesla ever attained.“I am sure his magnifying transmitters were spectacular. . . . He probablygenerated some interesting arcs and sparks that were what we now study asplasmas. The containment of plasmas is a huge area of modern physics. Forexample . . . to see if small amounts of matter can be turned into immenseamounts of electrical power in carefully contained plasmas.” But Tesla’s earlydiscoveries and inventions, he concludes, were indeed ingenious and ahead oftheir time.11[../Text/CR%215N23DJBR8D4CN9E6RWFFQ06RHPEV_split_042.html#filepos978943]As this book goes to press, the Pentagon is studying the creation of a newbranch of the armed services, to be known as the U.S. Space Command, whoseprimary arsenal will consist of laser and particle-beam weapons fired from“space battleships.” In prose not unlike Tesla’s own, a Department of Defensefact sheet compares particle beams to “directed lightning bolts”—althoughwithout explicitly admitting that such a weapon has in fact been developed.It is difficult to assess the current state of the beam-weapons program becausevirtually everything about it is heavily classified. Apparently the technologyinvolved has proved to be complex and difficult, raising questions about theproject’s feasibility, but many experts nevertheless seem to be hard at work onthe problem. At the same time, the activities of the other nations in this areahave been monitored carefully by agencies of the federal government. Indeed thepossibility of creating a family of particle-beam weapons has been a subject ofserious discussion in this country for at least the past twenty-five years, andit is, in my opinion, of no little significance that as long ago as 1947 theMilitary Intelligence Service identified the writings about a particle beamamong Tesla’s scientific papers as being “of extreme importance.”Since he had no laboratory in the later years of his life, Tesla was unable todevelop his ideas. But it is undeniable that he described in general terms halfa century ago what may prove to be one of the main weapons of the Space Age. Andto the end of his days, Tesla the pacifist hoped that such knowledge would beused, not for war among Earthlings, but for interplanetary communication withour neighbors in space, of whose existence he felt certain."},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ESSAY Some of Tesla’s own writing—lectures, articles, patents, papers, and letters—isavailable in the United States.

One library isopen to the public, the second is semi-restricted, and the third containsmaterial seen only by members of the intelligence community. Tesla’s ideascontained in the research papers so urgently requisitioned by militaryintelligence in 1947 have indeed continued to be of great interest.When the Tesla Museum in Belgrade published The Colorado Springs Notes,1899–1900, in 1978, intelligence officers at the said U.S. defense researchagency at once made a careful comparison of both the Serbo-Croat and Englisheditions against their classified files for that period in Tesla’s life. Whatthey found, I am reliably told, is that the Slavs had omitted mainly practicalTeslian ideas that might prove patentable. His fundamental research in wavepropagation, radio and power transmission, and ball lighting, however, was foundto be substantially the same in the Notes as in the U.S. intelligence file.But the file apparently contains much more than the Notes. It almost certainlycontains the complete papers from which the Trump abstract, portions of whichwere quoted earlier, was derived. It undoubtedly contains the papers that thetwo young American engineers pored over night after night in a hotel room in theweeks just before Tesla’s death.
