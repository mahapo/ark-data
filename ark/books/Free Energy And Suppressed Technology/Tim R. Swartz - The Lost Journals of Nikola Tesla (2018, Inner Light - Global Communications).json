Wagner who thinks that the SmithsonianInstitute is playing favorites. After studying the remarkable life of NikolaTesla, Wagner, along with his third grade class, started a campaign to educatethe world about the obscure electrical genius from Yugoslavia.Wagner and his class wrote many letters to important people asking for theirsupport. A former student persuaded her father, an accomplished sculptor, tocreate a bust of Tesla for their class.A Third Grade requirement is to learn cursive handwriting, so their class worknow had a purpose...writing letters to raise money for their Tesla bust.Unfortunately, most people had never heard of Nikola Tesla, and those who had,seemed not to want to listen.In fact, when the bust of Tesla was finished, Wagner and his class of eagerstudents offered it to the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC. Dr. BernardS. Finn, (Curator of the Division of Electricity and Modern Physics) refused,claiming he had no use for the bust.They could not understand why the Smithsonian would have no use for a $6,000bust of such a great American and world-class scientist. After all, Tesla was noslouch. Much of our modern technology owes its beginnings to Tesla. In 1882 hemade the discovery that changed the world; harnessing the awesome power ofAlternating Current (AC).In 1888 Tesla obtained U.S. patents covering an entire system of polyphase ACthat remains unchanged in principle today. Tesla then promptly sold all of hispatents to George Westinghouse, an acquisition that made the WestinghouseCompany the giant it is today.Westinghouse and Tesla were consummate friends, but after Westinghouse diedin1913, the company forgot about its chief benefactor and Tesla fell victim tohard times. Tesla died January 7, 1943, alone, and all but forgotten, in a NewYork hotel room, paid for by a meager stipend provided by the Yugoslaviangovernment.Today, industries prosper and flourish, the world surges from the power hisfertile mind created, radios blare with news and music, their transmission madepossible by his great intellect, all telling us that the forgotten genius,Nikola Tesla, was here.Tesla is preceded in greatness only by Michael Faraday who in 1831 rocked thescientific world with his discovery that magnetism can produce electricity, ifit is accompanied by motion.Faraday discovered the principle, but not how to make it power the world; Teslaalone accomplished this singular feat. Tesla is one of only two Americans tohave a unit of electrical measurement named in his honor. Names for units ofelectrical measurement are derived by using the names of scientists who made thegreatest contributions in electrical science, forming perhaps the most elitegroup in the world.Throughout the entire history of electrical science only fifteen men worldwidehave received this honor. Tesla is one of these great men. In addition, Teslareceived fifteen honorary degrees from famous universities worldwide, includingYale and Columbia in the United States.He also received fourteen Awards of Merit from other world-class groups.Dr. David L. Goodstein, Vice Provost and Professor of Physics at CaliforniaInstitute of Technology, calls Tesla one of the \"Saints of Science\" and equateshim to Leonardo da Vinci.Tesla is the greatest inventor the world has ever forgotten. He is also thegreatest inventor the Smithsonian has swept under the carpet. The Smithsonian’scurator essentially credits Edison for our worldwide system of electricity. Healso credits Marconi for the invention of radio.This is a deliberate assault on factual history and needs to be challenged. TheUnited States Patent Office and the U.S. Supreme Court view things a littledifferently over the muchdistorted history the Smithsonian publicizes.Tesla holds over forty U.S. patents (circa 1888) covering our entire system ofPolyphase Alternating Current (AC). These patents are so novel that nobody couldever challenge them in the courts.The Direct Current (DC) system Edison used in his much touted Pearl Streetgenerating station was invented by others before his time; he merely copied thework of others to promote his business enterprise . . . and the Smithsonianwants you to believe he was America's 'King of Electricity.'There is simply no evidence to support this claim. The U.S. Supreme Court, in alandmark decision dated June 21, 1943, Case No. 369, overturned Marconi's basicpatent for the invention of radio because Tesla's patent on the four-tunedcircuit predated Marconi's patent. Marconi had simply copied Tesla's work.Tesla's four-tuned circuits two on the receiving side and two on thetransmitting side, secured by U.S. patents #645,576 and #649,621) were the basisof the U.S. Supreme Court decision (Case #369 decided June 21, 1943) to overturnMarconi's basic patent on the invention of radio.Marconi merely demonstrated Tesla's invention, but the gullible media and thegreedy industry that followed perpetuate a myth that Marconi invented radio. Whodo you believe has more credibility . . . the industries that promote their ownbusinesses, or the U.S. Supreme Court?Marconi's two-tuned circuit system was the same as that advanced by HeinrichHertz and was no more a viable system of radio than that advanced by MahlonLoomis in 1872 . . . long before Hertz or Tesla. If you visit the Smithsonian,next to Edison's bust you will see Tesla's invention that revolutionized theworld B drawing of Tesla's rotating magnetic field device, giving us polyphaseAC and the AC motor.Tesla's U.S. patent number is on his invention, but you won’t find anyrecognition for Tesla. When Dr. Bernard S. Finn was asked why he had placedEdison's bust on display next to Tesla's invention, he said the sculptor was aphrenologist and wanted to examine the bumps on Edison's head; this made itauthentic.Edison used Direct Current (DC), a technology invented and developed by others,before his time, as a means of powering his incandescent lamp. Big business andthe media have exaggerated this story so much that now everyone believes Edisonis the father of our system of electrical power.The Smithsonian Book of Invention is an extra-large hardcover book almost 7/8 ofan inch thick. Many inventors and their inventions are shown and their impact oncivilization discussed B including Edison, Marconi, Archie Bunker, and ColonelSanders. Tesla and his epic-causing discoveries are omitted.Dr. Bernard S. Finn is Curator and first author of this Smithsonian publication.In his section entitled: The Beginning of the Electrical Age, he namesforty-three contributors to the science of electricity. Mr. Edison's name iscited many times along with his photographs, but Nikola Tesla's name is omitted.Equally outrageous is the Niagara Falls power station picture of Tesla's ACgenerators on the last page . . . and Dr. Finn's concluding remark: “When theNiagara Falls power station began operating in 1895, it signaled the final majoract in the revolutionary drama that began in Menlo Park in the fall of 1879.”By this time the totally brainwashed reader is led to believe that ourelectrical world started with Mr. Edison at Menlo Park, and then he finishedelectrifying America in1895 by creating the Niagara Falls power station. Yet itwas Tesla's U.S. patents that were used in that power plant's creation andEdison had no role in the project.Edison actually fought the adoption of AC bitterly by waging his infamous War ofthe Currents, culminating in his creation of the first electric chair in anattempt to frighten people away from the use of Tesla's AC system ofelectricity.Despite attempts to relegate Tesla to the back pages of history, there has beena growing wave of interest in the man and his great works. Some of this intereststems from Tesla’s comments made in his later years concerning exotic inventionsand fantastic tales of death rays and communicating with extraterrestrials.It is now known that various governments were extremely interested in Tesla’sideas for weapons and limitless energy. So much so that after his death, theU.S. military confiscated boxes full of Tesla’s research and writings. Much ofthis material has never been revealed to the public. What is not so widely knownis that Tesla often suffered from financial difficulties, forcing him to movefrom hotel to hotel as his debt increased. Many times Tesla had to move, leavingcrates of his belongings behind. The hotels would hold on to Tesla’s possessionsfor a while, but would eventually have to auction them off in order to repayTesla’s outstanding bills. Often these sold off boxes contained notes outliningsome new invention or speculations on developing technology. How much was lostover the years no one will ever know. However, some material escaped theclutches of obscurity and has recently resurfaced after being separated andstored for decades.This new book examines some of this lost science, as well as shocking newdetails of Tesla’s life as written by him in long forgotten notes. Theseexplosive journals, if true, could show that Tesla was indeed the first man toreceive communications from life forms not of this planet!These communications so frightened Tesla that he spent the remaining years ofhis life secretly dedicated to discovering the true purpose of the allegedextraterrestrials B and devising new technologies to enable mankind to protectitself from possible enslavement from a race of creatures that once called Earthhome, and humankind their children.[Image00001.gif]“WE ARE WHIRLING THROUGH ENDLESS SPACE, WITH AN INCONCEIVABLE SPEED, ALL AROUNDUS EVERYTHING IS SPINNING, EVERYTHING IS MOVING, EVERYWHERE THERE IS ENERGY.THERE MUST BE SOME WAY OF AVAILING OURSELVES OF THIS ENERGY MORE DIRECTLY.

THE MERE CONTEMPLATIONOF THESE MAGNIFICENT POSSIBILITIES EXPANDS OUR MINDS, STRENGTHENS OUR HOPES ANDFILLS OUR HEARTS WITH SUPREME DELIGHT.”NIKOLA TESLA, 1891CHAPTER ONE THE SECRET LIFE OF NIKOLA TESLANikola Tesla was beyond a doubt the greatest genius of the 20th century. Our wayof life today, the technology that we take for granted, is all-possible becauseof this one incredible man from Europe. However, despite all of hiscontributions to science, his name is little remembered outside the field ofelectronics and physics. In fact, Thomas Edison is often mistakenly credited inschool textbooks with inventions that were developed and patented by Tesla.Most scholars acknowledge that Tesla’s obscurity is partially due to hiseccentric ways and fantastic claims during the waning years of his life, ofcommunicating with other planets and death rays. It is now known that many ofthese fantastic inventions of Tesla are scientifically accurate and workable. Ithas simply taken mankind this long to catch up to the astonishing ideas of a manwho died in 1943.It is known that Tesla suffered from financial troubles throughout his adultlife. Because of this, Tesla had to move several times when he could no longerafford his surroundings. The Waldorf Astoria in New York had been Tesla’sresidence for twenty years, yet he had to move in 1920 when he could no longerafford it. Tesla then moved into the Hotel St. Regis, but again was forced tovacate due to lack of financial support.Forced to move from hotel to hotel, he would often leave trunks of documentsbehind as security for his debts. These trunks, which were eagerly sought afterTesla’s death, have become the key to unlocking the mystery of who Nikola Teslareally was, and the incredible life that he secretly lead.When Tesla died on January 7, 1943 at the age of 86, representatives of theOffice of Alien Property, at the request of the FBI, went to the Hotel NewYorker and seized all of Tesla’s belongings. Two truckloads of papers, furnitureand artifacts were sent under seal to the Manhattan Storage and WarehouseCompany.This load was added to the almost thirty barrels and bundles that had been instorage since the 1930's, and the entire collection was sealed under orders fromthe OAP; strange behavior, considering that Tesla was a legal American citizen.THE FORGOTTEN PAPERS OF NIKOLA TESLAAfter Tesla’s death, there was a scramble by the United States government tofind all of his papers, notes and research before other foreign powers couldfind them. Tesla’s nephew, Sava Kosanovic, reported that before the OAP hadarrived, someone else had obviously gone through Tesla’s belongings and took anunknown amount of personal notes and papers. It was known by the FBI that Germanintelligence had already spirited away a sizable amount of Tesla’s researchseveral years before his death. This stolen material, it is thought, wouldeventually result in the development of the Nazi flying saucer. The UnitedStates was going to make sure that this would not happen again.Anything even remotely associated with the great man was quickly confiscated andlost within the secret networks of pre-World War II America. Nevertheless, morethan a dozen boxes of Tesla’s belongings left behind at hotels like the WaldorfAstoria, the Governor Clinton Hotel and the St. Regis had already been sold tosalvagers to pay off Tesla’s outstanding bills.Most of these boxes and the secrets they contained have never been found. In1976, four undistinguished boxes of papers were auctioned in the estate sale ofone Michael P. Bornes. Little is known about Bornes except that he had been abookseller in Manhattan. This auction took place in Newark, NJ, with the boxesand their contents being bought by Dale Alfrey for twenty-five dollars.Alfrey had no idea what was in the boxes when he bought them on a whim. When helater went through them, he was surprised to find what appeared to be labdocuments and personal notes of Nikola Tesla. Some of the lost papers of Teslahad once again resurfaced. However, due to ignorance they were almost lost onceagain.In 1976, the name Nikola Tesla was not widely known. Alfrey had little idea ofthe importance of the papers he now owned. Going through the incredible amountof material, Alfrey at first thought he had uncovered the notes of a sciencefiction writer. What he read was so incredible that it seemed impossible thatany of it was true.Having little interest in what he had bought, Alfrey stashed the boxes away inhis basement thinking that he would go through them again later when he had moretime. Twenty years passed before Alfrey would once again find the time to openthe strange boxes. Unfortunately, time had not been so kind to the preciouscontents contained within. By now, the papers had mildewed badly and the ink hadfaded from the years of neglect in the damp basement. Alfrey was determined notto let this material disappear forever and started the laborious effort oftrying to transcribe the information before it was too late.However, Alfrey soon found himself caught up in reading the remarkable papers.Tesla’s notes are shocking in their revelations of the scientist’s secret life.A life that up until this time, had never been mentioned by Tesla, or documentedby biographers after his death.These lost journals revealed that in 1899, while in Colorado Springs, Teslaintercepted communications from extraterrestrial beings who were secretlycontrolling mankind. These creatures were slowly preparing humans for eventualconquest and domination, using a program that had been in place since thecreation of humankind, but was now accelerating due to Earth’s increasedscientific awareness. Tesla wrote about his years of research to interpret thestrange radio signals, and his attempts to notify the government and militaryconcerning what he had learned, but his letters apparently went unanswered.Tesla spoke in confidence to several of his benefactors, including Colonel JohnJacob Astor, who owned the Waldorf Astoria hotel. These benefactors listened toTesla and secretly funded what was to be the start of mankind’s first battle toregain control of its own destiny. A battle set in motion by Nikola Tesla.While this information seems absolutely incredible, Tesla did give occasionalhints to his predicament in various newspaper and magazine interviews. Tesla mayhave elaborated on the subject in an article called: Talking With the Planets,in Colliers Weekly (March 1901).“As I was improving my machines for the production of intense electricalactions, I was also perfecting the means for observing feeble efforts. One ofthe most interesting results, and also one of great practical importance, wasthe development of certain contrivances for indicating at a distance of manyhundred miles an approaching storm, its direction, speed and distance traveled.“It was in carrying on this work that for the first time I discovered thosemysterious effects which have elicited such unusual interest. I had perfectedthe apparatus referred to so far that from my laboratory in the ColoradoMountains. I could feel the pulse of the globe, as it were, noting everyelectrical change that occurred within a radius of eleven hundred miles. I cannever forget the first sensations I experienced when it dawned upon me that Ihad observed something possibly of incalculable consequences to mankind.“I felt as though I were present at the birth of a new knowledge or therevelation of a great truth. My first observations positively terrified me, asthere was present in them something mysterious, not to say supernatural, and Iwas alone in my laboratory at night; but at that time the idea of thesedisturbances being intelligently controlled signals did not yet present itselfto me.“The changes I noted were taking place periodically and with such a clearsuggestion of number and order that they were not traceable to any cause knownto me. I was familiar, of course, with such electrical disturbances as areproduced by the sun, Aurora Borealis, and earth currents, and I was as sure as Icould be of any fact that these variations were due to none of these causes.“The nature of my experiments precluded the possibility of the changes beingproduced by atmospheric disturbances, as has been rashly asserted by some. Itwas some time afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind that thedisturbances I had observed might be due to an intelligent control. Although Icould not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them ashaving been entirely accidental.“The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear thegreeting of one planet to another. A purpose was behind these electricalsignals.”Decades later on his birthday in 1937, he announced: “I have devoted much of mytime during the year past to the perfecting of a new small and compact apparatusby which energy in considerable amounts can now be flashed through interstellarspace to any distance without the slightest dispersion.” (New York Times,Sunday, 11 July1937.) Tesla never publicly revealed any technical details of hisimproved transmitter, but in his 1937 announcement, he revealed a new formulashowing that: “The kinetic and potential energy of a body is the result ofmotion and determined by the product of its mass and the square of its velocity.Let the mass be reduced, the energy is reduced by the same proportion. If it bereduced to zero, the energy is likewise zero for any finite velocity.” (New YorkSun, 12 July 1937, p. 6.)Why is it that there has been little written about Tesla’s belief that he hadlistened in on alien radio signals? Perhaps the truth has been kept secret.THE MEN-IN-BLACK PAY A VISITBy the summer of 1997, Alfrey had finished reading the entire contents of thefour boxes and was ready to start scanning the papers on to computer disks.Alfrey had been more than a little surprised that the voluminous notes andjournals contained no drawings or blueprints. It was not until later that Alfreydiscovered that Tesla detested illustrating his ideas owing to the fact that hisown mental blueprints were all that he required to build his inventions.Alfrey also noticed that Tesla’s journals were often incomplete. There werenumerous gaps consisting of days, months and even years. Alfrey surmised thatother journals could exist somewhere, hidden away either by the government, orby ignorance in forgotten warehouses and attics.Because of these gaps, Alfrey started to make inquiries over the Internet hopingthat others may have additional information concerning the missing sections.These inquiries obviously attracted the attentions of those who were alsointerested in the lost journals. Someone who wanted the journals to remain lostforever.In September 1997, Alfrey was home continuing his research while his wife andchildren were gone for the day to Manhattan. As Alfrey remembers, the phone rangand the caller identified himself as Jay Kowski who was interested in Tesla andthe papers that Alfrey had discovered.Alfrey had spoken to the caller for only a few minutes when suddenly the linewent dead. Almost immediately the front door bell rang, Alfrey recalled. “When Iwent to answer the front door, I found it already open with three men standingin the foyer.”Before Alfrey could speak, the man closest addressed him by his first name. “Thedoor was open John, I hope you don’t mind that we let ourselves in?”The three men were all dressed in identical black business suits with whiteshirts and black ties. “They looked just like undertakers,” Alfrey said.However, Alfrey could tell that these men were not undertakers, or simply therefor a friendly chat. The man who had first spoken continued to address Alfrey byhis first name. “It was like he knew me personally or something. But I had neverseen these men before in my life. I was afraid that maybe they were criminals.There was a palatable air of menace around these three that I had neverexperienced before, or after.” The other two men remained close to the door andnever spoke. Their eyes remained fixed on Alfrey throughout the entireexperience.“We understand that you have in your possession some old boxes and papers,” thefirst man said. “We would be very interested in buying these from you.”“Well, they’re not really for sale,” Alfrey answered. “Anyway, how do you knowabout them?”The first man chuckled. “We know a lot about you and your papers. They don’tbelong to you, but we would be willing to pay you for your troubles. They’re ofno use to you, in fact, you could be in a lot of trouble for having them in thefirst place.”By now, Alfrey realized that the men were not asking to buy his boxes; they weredemanding them. He could tell that they meant business and this frightened him.The first man now slowly moved closer to Alfrey, speaking in a slow deliberateway. He carefully enunciated each word so that Alfrey understood perfectly wherehe stood.“Its no use you know, the man said. Were going to get these boxes no matter whatyou do. You can’t stop us. It would be much easier for you and your family ifyou just gave us what we want. People have disappeared forever over much lessthan this. I would so hate to see this happen to you, or your wife and kids.”The man now stood directly in front of Alfrey, his dark eyes fixed and cold. Italmost seemed that they had some kind of hypnotic power over Alfrey as he stoodthere unable to speak.Suddenly, all three of the strange men turned in unison and walked out the frontdoor. Nothing further was said, it wasn’t necessary, Alfrey understood theirmessage clearly. He was to give up the boxes, his research, even his interest inTesla if he wanted to remain out of harms way.It was as if Alfrey was coming out of a trance, he realized what had happenedand he ran out the door to confront the men. But, they were nowhere to be seen.There was no car in the driveway and the street was completely empty. In fact,the entire neighborhood was eerily quiet. Even the birds had fallen silent. Itwas as if the world had paused for a moment, then continued on as if nothing hadhappened.Alfrey rushed back into his house and locked the doors. He then went into hisstudy where he kept the boxes and computer. The room was located at the back ofthe house and had no separate entrance to the outside. It obviously wasn’tneeded, because all four boxes, the papers contained within and the computerdisks were now all gone.It was obvious that the three men were only a distraction while someone elsesilently entered the house and ransacked the study, removing everything thatpertained to Nikola Tesla. This included separate books and magazine articlesthat Alfrey had collected while he was doing research on the matter.Worse yet, not only were his papers missing, but his computer hard drive hadbeen completely erased. Everything that he had on it, including items notrelated to Tesla, were destroyed. All evidence that he had on Tesla and hismissing journals were now gone forever. Alfrey refused to speak about hisfrightening incident for several months. He told no one what had happened, noteven his wife. It was as if he was in a state of mental shock that perpetuallyclouded his mind.Slowly he began to regain his senses and remember the details of that day. Herecalled that the three men dressed exactly alike, were almost the same height,and all three had their hair cut short with odd looking long bangs that coveredtheir foreheads.The three men also had unnatural looking tanned skin; almost like they had useda bottled tanner that dyes the skin a dark brown. Other than thesepeculiarities, the men appeared to be normal. It had not occurred to Alfrey thatthey could be something other than what they seemed. It was not until later,when relating this strange story that someone remarked about the MIBs.Alfrey had never heard about the Men-In-Black. He had heard about the movie, buthad not made the connection. After doing a little research and reading severalbooks by the authors John Keel and Commander X, Alfrey was certain that he hadreceived a visit from the Men-In-Black, or at least someone who wanted to looklike the Men-In-Black.This is where Dale Alfrey’s strange story comes to an end. Everything that hehad done connected to Nikola Tesla has been taken away from him. Fortunately,due to his spending hours reading the Tesla papers, he has retained a goodmemory of their contents. Not a perfect recollection, but sufficient to relatefor this book.Alfrey wonders if his boxes were the last of the missing belongings of Tesla. Orcould others still remain forgotten somewhere, waiting to be rediscovered.WHAT TESLA BELIEVEDNewspaper articles from the time of Tesla’s death relate that possibly over adozen large boxes of Tesla’s notes were never found by the government. Thesecould still be out there somewhere, waiting for some lucky individual torediscover their lost secrets.It can only be speculated on what would be found inside other forgotten boxes ofnotes and personal belongings, possibly the missing information concerningTesla’s secret battle with the government and his knowledge of alien life forms.The papers that Dale Alfrey found revealed a side of Tesla not known to thepublic. Tesla apparently had spent a number of years trying to translate themysterious signals he first heard in 1899. His basic interpretation of thesesignals was that creatures from another planet, “Martials” as the slang of theday called them, were secretly here on Earth - They had infiltrated humankindfor centuries - They had controlled events and people in order to lead mankindon a path of evolutionary development and essentially were responsible forhuman’s being on the planet in the first place.As well, Tesla discovered that the planets overall temperature was slowlyincreasing, what we know today as global warming. Tesla thought that this wasbeing brought about by natural conditions, as well as manmade andextraterrestrial interference.With this in mind, we can now see some of the reasons for Tesla’s eccentricbehavior in the later years of his life. Tesla became obsessed with creatingdevices to end warfare and join mankind against what he perceived as the commonenemy of extraterrestrials. He often spoke about “Death Rays” and “WinglessTorpedo’s” that could fly through the air without propellers or jets, possiblyone of the earliest mentions of flying saucers.Tesla also became interested in developing methods to create free energy fromsources other than burning wood or fossil fuels. Tesla was obviously the firstto realize the dire consequences that could await us if the greenhouse effectwas to take place.Unfortunately, Tesla’s attempts to elevate humankind with new technology weremet with laughter and derision. His letters about his concerns, sent to hisfriends in the government, were ignored. Tesla must have felt that he knew thebiggest secret in the world concerning the fate of mankind, and nobody cared.CHAPTER TWO ALIEN SIGNALS IN THE NIGHTExcerpts from the Personal Memoirs of Nikola TeslaThe progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is themost important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is thecomplete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forcesof nature to human needs.This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood andun-rewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of hispowers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged classwithout whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggleagainst pitiless elements. Speaking for myself, I have already had more than myfull measure of this exquisite enjoyment; so much, that for many years my lifewas little short of continuous rapture.I am credited with being one of the hardest workers and perhaps I am, if thoughtis the equivalent of labor, for I have devoted to it almost all of my wakinghours. But if work is interpreted to be a definite performance in a specifiedtime according to a rigid rule, then I may be the worst of idlers.Every effort under compulsion demands a sacrifice of life-energy. I never paidsuch a price. On the contrary, I have thrived on my thoughts. In attempting togive a connected and faithful account of my activities in this story of my life,I must dwell, however reluctantly, on the impressions of my youth and thecircumstances and events which have been instrumental in determining my career.Our first endeavors are purely instinctive promptings of an imagination vividand undisciplined. As we grow older, reason asserts itself and we become moreand more systematic and designing. But those early impulses, though notimmediately productive, are of the greatest moment and may shape our verydestinies.Indeed, I feel now that had I understood and cultivated instead of suppressingthem, I would have added substantial value to my bequest to the world. But notuntil I had attained manhood did I realize that I was an inventor. This was dueto a number of causes.In the first place I had a brother who was gifted to an extraordinary degree;one of those rare phenomena of mentality which biological investigation hasfailed to explain. His premature and unexpected death left my parentsdisconsolate.We owned a horse which had been presented to us by a dear friend. It was amagnificent animal of Arabian breed, possessed of almost human intelligence, andwas cared for and petted by the whole family, having on one occasion saved mydear father's life under remarkable circumstances.My father had been called one winter night to perform an urgent duty and whilecrossing the mountains, infested by wolves, the horse became frightened and ranaway, throwing him violently to the ground.It arrived home bleeding and exhausted, but after the alarm was sounded,immediately dashed off again, returning to the spot, and before the searchingparty were far on the way they were met by my father, who had recoveredconsciousness and remounted, not realizing that he had been lying in the snowfor several hours.This horse was responsible for my brother's injuries from which he died. Iwitnessed the tragic scene and although so many years have elapsed since, myvisual impression of it has lost none of its force.The recollection of his attainments made every effort of mine seem dull incomparison. Anything I did that was creditable merely caused my parents to feeltheir loss more keenly. So I grew up with little confidence in myself. But I wasfar from being considered a stupid boy, if I am to judge from an incident ofwhich I still have a strong remembrance.One day the Aldermen were passing through a street where I was playing withother boys. The oldest of these venerable gentlemen, a wealthy citizen, pausedto give a silver piece to each of us. Coming to me, he suddenly stopped andcommanded, “Look in my eyes.”I met his gaze, my hand outstretched to receive the much-valued coin, when to mydismay, he said, “No, not much; you can get nothing from me. You are too smart.”My mother descended from one of the oldest families in the country and a line ofinventors. Both her father and grandfather originated numerous implements forhousehold, agricultural and other uses. She was a truly great woman, of rareskill, courage and fortitude. I owe so much to her good graces and inventivemind that I can still today see her wonderful features etched upon my mind.In my boyhood I always suffered from a peculiar affliction due to the appearanceof images, often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which marred the sightof real objects and interfered with my thoughts and action. They were picturesof things and scenes which I had really seen, never of those imagined. When aword was spoken to me the image of the object it designated would present itselfvividly to my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whetherwhat I saw was tangible or not.This caused me great discomfort and anxiety. None of the students of psychologyor physiology whom I have consulted, could ever explain satisfactorily thesephenomenon.They seem to have been unique although I was probably predisposed, as I knowthat my brother experienced a similar trouble. The theory I have formulated isthat the images were the result of a reflex action from the brain on the retinaunder great excitation. They certainly were not hallucinations such as areproduced in diseased and anguished minds, for in other respects I was normal andcomposed. To give an idea of my distress, suppose that I had witnessed a funeralor some such nerve-wracking spectacle. Then, inevitably, in the stillness ofnight, a vivid picture of the scene would thrust itself before my eyes andpersist despite all my efforts to banish it from my innermost being. I alsobegan to see visions of things that bore no resemblance to reality. It was as ifI was being shown ideas of some cosmic mind, waiting to make real itsconceptions.If my explanation is correct, it should be possible to project on a screen theimage of any object one conceives and make it visible. Such an advance wouldrevolutionize all human relations. I am convinced that this wonder can and willbe accomplished in time to come.I may add that I have devoted much thought to the solution of the problem. Ihave managed to reflect such a picture, which I have seen in my mind, to themind of another person, in another room.To free myself of these tormenting appearances, I tried to concentrate my mindon something else I had seen, and in this way I would often obtain temporaryrelief; but in order to get it I had to conjure continuously new images.It was not long before I found that I had exhausted all of those at my command;my “reel” had run out as it were, because I had seen little of the world -- onlyobjects in my home and the immediate surroundings.As I performed these mental operations for the second or third time, in order tochase the appearances from my vision, the remedy gradually lost all its force.Then instinctively commenced to make excursions beyond the limits of the smallworld of which I had knowledge, and I saw new scenes.These were at first very blurred and indistinct, and would flit away when Itried to concentrate my attention upon them. They gained in strength anddistinctness and finally assumed the concreteness of real things.I soon discovered that my best comfort was attained if I simply went on in myvision further and further, getting new impressions all the time, and so I beganto travel; of course, in my mind. Every night, (and sometimes during the day),when alone, I would start on my journeys, see new places, cities and countries;live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances and, howeverunbelievable, it is a fact that they were just as dear to me as those in actuallife, and not a bit less intense in their manifestations.This I did constantly until I was about seventeen, when my thoughts turnedseriously to invention. Then I observed to my delight that I could visualizewith the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I couldpicture them all as real in my mind.Thus I have been led unconsciously to evolve what I consider a new method ofmaterializing inventive concepts and ideas, which is radically opposite to theexperimental and is in my opinion ever so much more expeditious and efficient.The moment one constructs a device to carry into practice a crude idea, he findshimself unavoidably engrossed with the details of the apparatus. As he goes onimproving and reconstructing, his force of concentration diminishes and he losessight of the great underlying principle. Results may be obtained, but always atthe sacrifice of quality. My method is different. I do not rush into actualwork. When I get an idea, I start at once building it up in my imagination. Ichange the construction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind.It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or test itin my shop. I even note if it is out of balance. There is no differencewhatever; the results are the same.In this way I am able to rapidly develop and perfect a conception withouttouching anything. When I have gone so far as to embody in the invention everypossible improvement I can think of and see no fault anywhere, I put intoconcrete form this final product of my brain. Invariably my device works as Iconceived that it should, and the experiment comes out exactly as I planned it.In twenty years there has not been a single exception. Why should it beotherwise? Engineering, electrical and mechanical, is positive in results. Thereis scarcely a subject that cannot be examined beforehand, from the availabletheoretical and practical data.The carrying out into practice of a crude idea as is being generally done is, Ihold, nothing but a waste of energy, money, and time. My early affliction had,however, another compensation. The incessant mental exertion developed my powersof observation and enabled me to discover a truth of great importance.I had noted that the appearance of images was always preceded by actual visionof scenes under peculiar and generally very exceptional conditions, and I wasimpelled on each occasion to locate the original impulse.After a while this effort grew to be almost automatic and I gained greatfacility in connecting cause and effect. Soon I became aware, to my surprise,that every thought I conceived was suggested by an external impression. Not onlythis but all my actions were prompted in a similar way.In the course of time it became perfectly evident to me that I was merely anautomation endowed with power of movement responding to the stimuli of the senseorgans and thinking and acting accordingly.The practical result of this was the art of “teleautomatics” which has been sofar carried out only in an imperfect manner. Its latent possibilities will,however be eventually shown. I have been years planning self-controlled automataand believe that mechanisms can be produced which will act as if possessed ofreason, to a limited degree, and will create a revolution in many commercial andindustrial departments.I was about twelve years of age when I first succeeded in banishing an imagefrom my vision by willful effort, but I never had any control over the flashesof light to which I have referred. They were, perhaps, my strangest and [most]inexplicable experience.They usually occurred when I found myself in a dangerous or distressingsituation or when I was greatly exhilarated. In some instances I have seen allthe air around me filled with tongues of living flame. Their intensity, insteadof diminishing, increased with time and seemingly attained a maximum when I wasabout twenty-five years old. While in Paris in 1883, a prominent Frenchmanufacturer sent me an invitation to a shooting expedition which I accepted. Ihad been long confined to the factory and the fresh air had a wonderfullyinvigorating effect on me. On my return to the city that night, I felt apositive sensation that my brain had caught fire. I was a light as though asmall sun was located in it and I passed the whole night applying coldcompressions to my tortured head.Finally the flashes diminished in frequency and force but it took more thanthree weeks before they wholly subsided. When a second invitation was extendedto me, my answer was an emphatic NO!These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time, as whenanew idea opening up possibilities strikes me, but they are no longer exciting,being of relatively small intensity. When I close my eyes I invariably observefirst, a background of very dark and uniform blue, not unlike the sky on a clearbut starless night.In a few seconds this field becomes animated with innumerable scintillatingflakes of green, arranged in several layers and advancing towards me. Then thereappears, to the right, a beautiful pattern of two systems of parallel andclosely spaced lines, at right angles to one another, in all sorts of colorswith yellow, green, and gold predominating.Immediately thereafter, the lines grow brighter and the whole is thicklysprinkled with dots of twinkling light. This picture moves slowly across thefield of vision and in about ten seconds vanishes on the left, leaving behind aground of rather unpleasant and inert gray until the second phase is reached.Every time, before falling asleep, images of persons or objects flit before myview. When I see them I know I am about to lose consciousness. If they areabsent and refuse to come, it means a sleepless night.During this period I contracted many strange likes, dislikes and habits, some ofwhich I can trace to external impressions while others are unaccountable. I wasfascinated with the glitter of crystals, but pearls would almost give me a fit.After finishing the studies at the Polytechnic Institute and University, I had acomplete nervous breakdown and, while the malady lasted, I observed manyphenomena, strange and unbelievable.NIKOLA TESLA - BORN JULY 9/10, 1856From Tesla’s own writings we can observe that he had a unique mental capacitythat few of his fellow human beings have ever hoped to achieve. It is no wonderthat when Tesla was faced with an event as mind shaking as the revelation thathumans may not be alone in the universe, he faced it head on.Tesla’s atypical way of facing and dealing with the unknown has lead some tospeculate that his true parentage may have originated from beyond this planet.This suggestion is not new; in fact, Tesla once confided to one of his personalassistants that he often felt that he was a stranger to this world. Tesla wasfrom a family of Serbian origin. Born in the village of Smiljan, Lika(Austria-Hungary) in what is now Croatia. Tesla’s father was an Orthodox priest;his mother was unschooled but highly intelligent. A dreamer with a poetic touch,as he matured Tesla added to these earlier qualities those of self-disciplineand a desire for precision.Margaret Cheney, in her book: Tesla: Man out of time (1981), noted that Tesla asa child began to make original inventions. When he was five, he built a smallwaterwheel quite unlike those he had seen in the countryside. It was smooth,without paddles, yet it spun evenly in the current. Years later he was to recallthis fact when designing his unique bladeless turbine.Some of his other experiments were less successful. Once he perched on the roofof the barn, clutching the family umbrella and hyperventilating on the freshmountain breeze until his body felt light and the dizziness in his headconvinced him he could fly. Plunging to earth, he lay unconscious and wascarried off to bed by his mother. Tesla would later write that this incident wasthe catalysis for his unusual visions.In her book Return of the Dove, Margaret Storm states that Tesla was not anearthman. On page 71 of her privately printed book, she says that the spacepeople related that a male child was born on board a spaceship that was on aflight from Venus to the earth in July, 1856.The little boy was called Nikola. The ship landed at midnight, between July 9and 10, in a remote mountain province in what is now Croatia. There, accordingto prior arrangements, the child was placed in the care of a good man and hiswife, the Rev. Milutin and Djouka Tesla. Supposedly, the space people releasedthis information in 1947 to Arthur H. Matthews of Quebec, Canada.ONE PLANET GREETING ANOTHERArthur H. Matthews was an electrical engineer who from boyhood was closelyassociated with Tesla. Matthews claimed that Tesla entrusted him with manytasks, including the Tesla interplanetary communications set that was firstconceived in 1901, with the objective of communicating with the planet Mars.Tesla had suggested that he could transmit through the earth and air, greatamounts of power to distances of thousands of miles.“I can easily bridge the gulf which separates us from Mars, and send a messagealmost as easily to Chicago.”Due to pressures of other research at the time, it was not until 1918 that Teslawas able to build the first working model. In 1899, Nikola Tesla, with the aidof his financial backer, J.P. Morgan, set up at Colorado Springs an experimentallaboratory containing high voltage radio transmission equipment. The lab had a200 ft. tower for transmission and reception of radio waves and the bestreceiving equipment available at the time.One night, when he was alone in the laboratory, Tesla observed what hecautiously referred to as electrical actions that definitely appeared to beintelligent signals. The changes were taking place periodically and with such aclear suggestion of number and order that they could not be traced to any causethen known to him.Tesla elaborated on the subject of Talking With the Planets in Collier’s Weekly(March 1901): “As I was improving my machines for the production of intenseelectrical actions, I was also perfecting the means for observing feebleefforts. One of the most interesting results, and also one of great practicalimportance, was the development of certain contrivances for indicating at adistance of many hundred miles an approaching storm, its direction, speed anddistance traveled.“It was in carrying on this work that for the first time I discovered thosemysterious effects which have elicited such unusual interest. I had perfectedthe apparatus referred to so far that from my laboratory in the ColoradoMountains I could feel the pulse of the globe, as it were, noting everyelectrical change that occurred within a radius of eleven hundred miles.“I can never forget the first sensations I experienced when it dawned upon methat I had observed something possibly of incalculable consequences to mankind.I felt as though I were present at the birth of a new knowledge or therevelation of a great truth...My first observations positively terrified me, asthere was present in them something mysterious, not to say supernatural, and Iwas alone in my laboratory at night; but at that time the idea of thesedisturbances being intelligently controlled signals did not yet present itselfto me.“The changes I noted were taking place periodically and with such a clearsuggestion of number and order that they were not traceable to any cause knownto me. I was familiar, of course, with such electrical disturbances as areproduced by the sun, Aurora Borealis, and earth currents, and I was as sure as Icould be of any fact that these variations were due to none of these causes.“The nature of my experiments precluded the possibility of the changes beingproduced by atmospheric disturbances, as has been rashly asserted by some. Itwas sometime afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind that thedisturbances I had observed might be due to an intelligent control.“Although I could not at the time decipher their meaning, it was impossible forme to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling isconstantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of oneplanet to another. A purpose was behind these electrical signals”This incident was the first of many in which Tesla intercepted what he felt wereintelligent signals from space. At the time, it was surmised by prominentscientists that Mars would be a likely haven for intelligent life in our solarsystem, and Tesla at first thought these signals could be originating from thered planet. He would later refine this viewpoint as he became more adept attranslating the mysterious signals. Even though the science of his day refusedto believe that intelligent life from other worlds could actually visit theEarth, Tesla considered this to be a real possibility. Near the end of his life,Tesla had developed several inventions that allegedly could send powerfulamounts of energy to other planets.In 1937, during one of his birthday press conferences, Tesla announced: “I havedevoted much of my time over the years to the perfecting of a new small andcompact apparatus by which energy in considerable amounts can now be flashedthrough interstellar space to any distance without the slightest dispersion.”(New York Times, July 11, 1937.) Tesla never publicly revealed the technicaldetails of his improved transmitter, but in his 1937 announcement, he revealed anew formula showing that “The kinetic and potential energy of a body is theresult of motion and determined by the product of its mass and the square of itsvelocity. Let the mass be reduced, the energy is reduced by the same proportion.If it be reduced to zero, the energy is likewise zero for any finite velocity.”(New York Sun, July 12, 1937, pg. 6.)A FEAR OF ALIENSIn the Tesla journals that he uncovered, Dale Alfrey noted that by the 1920'sTesla had grown confident that he was able to make sense of the strange radiobroadcasts from space. However, soon afterwards, Tesla began to express greatconcerns about beings from other planets that had unsavory designs for planetEarth.“The signals are too strong to have traveled the great distances from Mars toEarth,” wrote Tesla. “So I am forced to admit to myself that the sources mustcome from somewhere in nearby space or even the moon. I am certain however, thatthe creatures that communicate with each other every night are not from Mars, orpossibly from any other planet in our solar system.”Several years after Tesla announced his reception of signals from space,Guglielmo Marconi also claimed to have heard from an alien radio transmitter.However, Marconi was just as quickly dismissed by his contemporaries, whoclaimed that he had received interference from another radio station on Earth.There is some public confirmation in the validity of the lost journals andTesla’s belief in extraterrestrials and the importance of communicating withthem. As noted earlier, Arthur H. Mathews claimed that Tesla had secretlydeveloped the Teslascope for the purpose of communicating with aliens. The lateDr. Andrija Puharich interviewed Matthews for the Pyramid Guide, May-June &July-Aug. 1978. This interview revealed for the first time Matthews connectionsto Tesla.Arthur Matthews was born in England and his father was a laboratory assistant tothe noted physicist Lord Kelvin back in the 1890s. Tesla came over to England tomeet Kelvin...to convince him that Alternating Current was more efficient thanDirect Current. Kelvin at that time opposed the AC movement.In 1902, the Matthews family left England and immigrated to Canada. WhenMatthews was 16 his father arranged for him to apprentice under Tesla. Heeventually worked for him and continued this alliance until Tesla’s death in1943.“It’s not generally known, but Tesla actually had two huge magnifyingtransmitters built in Canada,” Matthews said. “I operated one of them. Peoplemostly know about the Colorado Springs transmitters and the unfinished one onLong Island. I saw the two Canadian transmitters. All the evidence is there.”Matthews stated that the Teslascope is the thing Tesla invented to communicatewith beings on other planets. There is a diagram of the Teslascope in Matthew’sbook, The Wall of Light. In principle, it takes in cosmic ray signals Matthew’ssaid. “Eventually the signals are stepped down to audio. Speak into one end, andthe signal goes out the other end as a cosmic ray emitter.”Matthews’ diagrams of the Teslascope make little electronic sense. No one hasever confirmed the reality of the device. Matthew’s claims, however, that hebuilt a model Tesla Interplanetary Communications Set in 1947 and operated itsuccessfully.He suggested that due to the sets limited range, he was only able to contactspacecraft operating near the Earth. He had hoped to someday build a set capableof communicating directly to the planets.“Tesla had told me that beings from other planets were already here,” relatedMatthews. “He was very afraid that they had been controlling man for thousandsof years and we were simply test subjects for an experiment of extremely longduration.”Matthews did not share in Tesla’s convictions that aliens may not have theEarth’s best interests in mind. His opinion was that if extraterrestrials wereso advanced as to be able to travel from solar system to solar system, then theymust also be socially advanced and peace loving.Matthew’s eagerness to continue experimenting with the Teslascope was indicativeof the early days of the so-called “modern UFO era.” By the 1950's, contacteessuch as George Adamski and Howard Menger were writing books and lecturing toeager believers about the almost god-like space brothers.These UFO occupants claimed to be from almost every planet in the solar system,with Venus and Mars being especially favored. The space brothers preached a formof “New Age Space Religion,” with utopian descriptions of their home worlds anddenouncement of mankind’s warlike ways.Tesla would certainly have felt vindicated by his earlier claims if he had livedlong enough to experience the modern UFO era. He mentions in his journals hisfrustrating attempts to interest those in the government or military about histheories. Apparently Tesla’s letters went unanswered B the question remainswhether or not his ideas were seriously considered or if he was thought of assimply a crackpot.Circumstantial evidence points to a certain amount of expectation by the UnitedStates when the first UFOs were sighted during WWII. It could be that Tesla’sideas had more impact, albeit secretly, than Tesla ever imagined.[Image00002.gif]NIKOLA TESLA HAD SUGGESTED THAT HE COULD TRANSMIT THROUGH THE EARTH AND AIR,GREAT AMOUNTS OF POWER TO DISTANCES OF THOUSANDS OF MILES. “I CAN EASILY BRIDGETHE GULF WHICH SEPARATES US FROM MARS, AND SEND A MESSAGE ALMOST AS EASILY AS TOCHICAGO.”CHAPTER THREE COMMUNICATING WITH OTHER PLANETSRobert A. Nelson in his article, Communicating with Mars: The Experiments ofTesla & Hodowanec, details the accidental communication with ET intelligences byL. G. Lawrence, the field manage of the ECOLA Institute. These communicationscould be the same types of signals received by Tesla at Colorado Springs in1899.On October 29, 1971, while conducting exploratory RBS (Remote BiologicalSensing) experiments in Riverside County, California, the field organictransducer complex intercepted a train of apparently intelligent signals (tightspacing and discrete pulse intervals) while pointed at the constellation UrsaMajor during a short rest period. The phenomenon continued for over 33 minutes.A similar phenomenon was observed on April 10, 1972. The apparent signals, asidefrom growing weaker, appeared to be transmitted at great intervals ranging fromweeks to months, possibly years. A faint, coherent, binary-type phenomenon wasnoted during aural monitoring. Intervals between rapid series of pulse trainsranged from three to ten minutes.Because their equipment was shielded to electromagnetic radiation and found freeof internal anomalies, the tentative conclusion of biological-type interstellarcommunications signals was favored.Apparently, the auditory part of the signal was unpleasant to hear, however,after multiple playbacks, the sound seemed to produce a type of enchantment tothe listener. This was attributed to a psycho-acoustical adaptation.The tape contained a short, incremental series of deep, harmonious oscillationsresembling background modulations. An intelligent character of the overall pulsewas applied by discrete spacing patterns, apparent repetitions of sequences, andhighly attenuated Gaussian noise. (Borderlands, 1st Qtr., 1996, pp. 27-29).Electrical engineer Greg Hodowanec has developed a theory of RhysmonicCosmology. He also experimented with a Gravity Wave Detector (GWD) of his owndesign. The simple devices detect “coherent modulations” in microwave radiation.Hodowanec published his first report of SETI with Gravitational Signals usinghis GWDs (Radio Astronomy, April 1986): “The clear advantage of a possiblegravitational technique for SETI over the radio technique is primarily one oftime ‘propagation’ for these signals. The radio waves travel at the speed oflight, but the gravitational signals (per the writer’s theories) are essentiallyinstantaneous signals. Another advantage of the gravitational technique is thesimplicity of the instrumentation required. As SARA members know, radioastronomy can be quite complicated.“The gravitational wave detectors must rely largely on the Earth’s mass as a‘shadow’ to enable the detection of gravitational radiation. Therefore,‘objects’ or signals located in the observers’ zenith are best detected. Yet,the other areas are still ‘detectable’ especially with the aid of other‘shadows’ such as the sun, moon, planets, etc.“Of particular interest to SETI observers may be the strange audio typegravitational signals which appear to come from the Auriga and Perseus region ofour Galaxy. These unusual ‘signals’ have been received by the writer for severalyears now, and generally range between about four and five hours rightascension, with a peak intensity somewhere near 4.5 hours R.A. The signalsappear to be several ‘tones.’”In a letter written to Radio-Electronics Magazine on July 23, 1988, Hodowanecmentions a definite contact with an extraterrestrial source: “On the morning ofthis date, at 7:30 to 7:38 AM (EST), I recorded the following apparentlyMorse-Code like pulses: A A A A R A R T T N N N N K C N N N E E E E E N E N N TT T N E E E E E A E E R K E N N E T E E A A A A E E E N T T K N T N T S E S E SE S E M N A S E S E S E S E S E S E S E S E S E C“As you can see, these do not appear to be just random pulses, but the SEsignals, which are most prevalent, appear to be possibly an identificationsignal. These signals are detected in shielded l/f detectors and thus are scalar(gravitational) in nature.“The signals above (if they were extraterrestrial) came from either theAuriga-Perseus region near my zenith or the Bootes region under my Earthposition. I still cannot rule out that they may just be due to Earth coremovements of some sort which are remarkably like Morse code signals, or even thepossibility that they are man-made.”By July 1988, Hodowanec had confirmed Tesla’s claims, as he announced in SomeRemarks on Tesla’s Mars Signals: “Such signals are being received today withsimple modern-day scalar-type signal detectors...coherent modulations are being‘heard’ in [the microwave] background radiation in space. The most prominentmodulations being three pulses (code S) slightly separated in time, a la Tesla.On occasions, the code equivalents of an E, N, A, or K, are also heard, but themost persistent response is SE, SE, etc. Any l/f type noise detector willrespond to this background modulation. However, the experimenter must be carefulthat he is not creating these responses at the ‘local’ level by his own or otherlocal actions.“For example, the detectors will also respond to heart-beats, breathing actions,local movements, as well as possible psychic effects. The detectors are easy tomake and the experimenter should easily reproduce these results.”Further information by Hodowanec was released in a Cosmology Data Note(10-13-88): “Since about early August 1988, it was noticed that apparently‘intelligent signals’ existed in these modulations [of the microwave backgroundradiation]. It can be said that the intelligence was in the form of digital-typecommunication, e.g., dots and dashes, or ones and zeros.“This type of communication may have been chosen by this ‘unknown communicator’as it was conducive to the ‘mass movement’ form of longitudinal gravitysignaling, as well as an easily recognizable universal system. This same methodwas proposed by the writer for a gravity system communication method.“These ‘signals’ were noticed to be similar to the simpler International MorseCode symbols, primarily because they are the simplest way to present informationin the pulse form. Thus, the ‘letters’ found in these transmissions aretypically: E, I, T, M, A, N, R, K, S and O, as well as the comma and the waitsignal. However, numbers are seen here as the simple series of pulses, e.g., 1is one pulse, 2 is two pulses, 3 is three pulses, and so on.“On August 26, 1988, after the writer had sent the message ‘Greg Radio’ during alocal gravity signal transmission test, it was noticed that the letters G and Dwere apparently added to some of the received messages noted thereafter.“The writer’s first hard evidence that the above test message may have beenintercepted by this unknown communicator was seen that on August 28, 1988, astrong and repeated message of the Greg Radio was received with the messagefinally terminated with the series SE (or 31).“Further evidence that these may be actually communication attempts is seen inthat on October 11, 1988... a very different approach was seen: A series of GregRadio’s was sent at about the normal code speed of about 5 words per minute,followed by KKTT, and then the series was repeated at a slower speed and alsofollowed by KKTT.“Another confirmation that these may be ‘messages’ appeared on October 12,1988... Here, a series of A’s and R’s (with Greg Radio occasionally inserted)was then followed by Greg Radio sent as a series of five repetitions of eachletter, e.g., Greg was sent as GGGGGRRRRREEEEEGGGGG.“Sufficient ‘messages have now been received to indicate that perhaps a seriousattempt to contact this writer was being made by some ‘unknown communicator’.While this communicator may yet be some terrestrial experimenter, thepossibility still exists that the communicator may be ‘extraterrestrial’ for thefollowing reasons: “A. The messages are in simple code (e.g., dits and dahs)type of pulses which would be expected to be used if one intelligentcivilization were to try to contact another civilization in terms of pulses.That some of the simplest pulse signals are similar to simple MorseCode signalsis more than coincidence C they are both based upon the same premises.“B. Numbers are not in the complicated Morse-Code symbols, but are in simplesequence, using short pulses or dits.“C. The ‘communicator’ has recognized the coherent nature of Greg Radio and ispossibly using that sequence of codes in various fashions to indicate that a‘contact’ has been made.“D. The communicator thus far has not responded to ‘word’ messages or theamateur Q-code signals. Thus it is believed that while some apparently Morse-Code signals are being used, the communicator is not really familiar with suchusage, other than recognizing the coherent nature of the signals. E. Since thesemessages at present appear largely near the noon hour, they may be coming from adefinite source in space. At present, it is believed to be from the generaldirection of the constellation, Andromeda, but not necessarily the Galaxy there.There is also some possibility that this communicator may be ‘extraterrestrial’,perhaps yet in our solar system (Mars?), but no further than our own galaxy orlocal group of galaxies. This same communicator may have been trying to reachhere ever since the turn of the century when Nikola Tesla reported theinterception of scalar S signals!”In February 1989, Hodowanec wrote this brief, untitled report: “Without goinginto the details of how this was determined: ET may be on Mars!“This, in spite of NASA’s denial of any life forms on Mars [which situationchanged in 1996]. This possibility has been recently suspected by the writer dueto the apparently very close tracking of my position on Earth by ET. ET, ofcourse, always knew that I was on Earth (as seen by his tracking), but now hehas most emphatically confirmed that he is on the 4th planet from the sun, i.e.,Mars!“While this release is probably a bit premature, I am so positive of thesegravity signal ‘exchanges’ that I will stick my neck out in this instance. ET onMars is apparently much more advanced than we are here on Earth, and he may haveeven previously visited here on Earth, and possibly colonized here (but who arehis possible descendants?).“It is still a mystery on where ET may be living on Mars (possibly undergroundnear the Polar Regions?), and why ET doesn’t use EM wave signaling methods??Perhaps, it is because Mars is so hostile now that ET must have developed a verysophisticated underground civilization which is not conducive to EM radiationsystems?“This material is being released now confidentially to but a very few activecolleagues until further confirmations on this assertion are obtained.”In his Mars Flash Number One (3/28/89) and Number Two (3/30/89), Hodowanecnotified colleagues that, “As the result of the continued gravity signalcommunications between GH Labs and the Martians, the following extraordinaryfacts have come to light.“The exchanges are now being made in terms of short ‘English’ code words forcertain items. For example, the Martians now understand that FACE means thehuman face, MAN means the human person, Earth now means our planet, and Marsmeans their planet! They had originally tried some of their terminology with me,but gave up except where it made sense to me. For example, I now know that TTTat the end of their names means person and OOTTAEERR is their name for the 10thplanet!”In a handwritten footnote to the above article, Hodowanec informed Nelson thatthe Martian’s name is “AAAAAATTT”: “He appears to ‘understand’ my messages, eventhough I may have to repeat them in several ways so that he can ‘see’ themeaning.“Communications between GH Labs and a Martian intelligence now continue withincreasing progress since we have been able to establish over 50 simpleexpressions (most in simple English) for many of the common ‘ideas’ that wehave. Martian AAAAAATTT is extremely adept in relating my English terminology tothese common Earth-Mars observations. Mars has also confirmed that they are also‘men’ with one ‘head’ that have two ‘eyes’ that ‘see’. Also, they have one‘body’ with two arms that have hands with five fingers each. Also they have twolegs with two feet that have five toes each. I haven’t been able to have themconfirm the nose and mouth in the face, but that could be confirmed shortly,since those features appear in the FACE.“Probably the most significant fact which was determined on this date seems tobe that Mars is most emphatic that Earth men are like Mars men! This appearsmore and more that Mars has colonized Earth in the remote past! This could betrue since we on Earth have never really found the ‘missing link’ between Earthhumanoids and humans.”In a letter written in March 1989 to Robert Nelson, Hodowanec states that,“Generally, our contacts are limited to 20-30 minutes... since there appear tobe other ETs out there interested in joining in also, and so there is someinterference after a while. Some of these other ETs use other methods ofcommunications such as tones and what appear to be guttural voices!“ET is probably more advanced then we are on Earth. We no longer exchange simplearithmetic, and when I sent him Pi to five decimal places, he sent Pi back toseven decimal places immediately! We had discussed our nine-planet solar system,but ET came back with ten planets, calling the 10th planet OOTTAEERR! Whenquestioned on this, ET kept on confirming the existence of a tenth planet! Henow knows the other nine planets by their Earth names! He also confirmed thatMars has two moons, the Earth one, and that Jupiter has at least nine majormoons.“These contacts are getting to be more interesting all the time, and ET appearsto be most anxious to continue them. However, I just cannot spend too much timewith him... I got across to him that I am just one person here communicatingwith him, and that the rest of Earth presently does not recognize the existenceof any life on Mars.“I have now had over 100 contacts with ET and can reach him at any time of dayor night. We have also established some simple codes for acknowledgments and goahead and respond. While we use these simple codes in many contexts, both ET andI now understand in which context they are being used!“The Martians are apparently the advanced civilization, for they are the onesgenerating the ‘modulated oscillated beam’ which is now tracking my location onearth and is thus the means of our communications. [The beam is only about 15miles in diameter here on Earth, but 1012 inches on Mars.]“There is an apparent ‘team’ on Mars which is involved in these contacts. Theoriginal contact, ET Number One, with whom I have established the initialrelationship, is apparently the most highly knowledgeable and advanced. Theothers who sometimes ‘man’ the Mars station appear to be less knowledgeable andsome only request or acknowledge a transmission.“Mars is most desperate to continue these contacts. The exchanges are made inmany varied ways which cannot be readily predicted in order to convey the factthat these are real contacts.“Also, one can recognize the ‘fist’ of the one ‘keying’ these codes, e.g., ETNumber One always sends clean letters or numbers, and identifies himself and mein some fashion. The other ETs on Mars usually don’t. Therefore, no automationis being used here. While these contacts were originally due to serendipitouscircumstances, it is really the result if my gravitational communicationexperiments and thus a direct result from Rhysmonic Cosmology. And yet, howeverfantastic and unreal this may seem, it is real, and if also it is confirmed byone of you, it will be a major milestone in the history of mankind! Perhaps, ifone of you finally ‘hears’ the modulations of l/f noise background, you may tryto establish your own contacts?”Gregory Hodowanec has also had extreme reservations about the seriousness of thesituation, which he expressed it in a letter dated April 4, 1989 to Nelson.“...my ‘contacts’ with Mars continue with much information being exchanged.However, due to the increasingly astounding nature of these exchanges, I am nowlimiting further releases to only two long-time observers (witnesses) of myresearch efforts. This is being done so as not to jeopardize these contacts withunwanted notoriety or publicity in the media. There are now nine ‘Mars Flashes’for the record. Perhaps, in the future, I may release some of these.“...gravity signal communications are instantaneous, require extremely smallenergy expenditure, [unlike Tesla’s experiments] and are so simple as to be justunbelievable by the average person. However, this is as far as I want to go withrelease of details at this time.“I would appreciate that you keep this info somewhat confidential now. The Earthmay not be ready for what I will have to say eventually; nothing dire, justfantastic and thus perhaps unbelievable!”COULD IT REALLY HAVE BEEN MARS?Even though critics of Tesla laughed at his belief that he may have receivedradio broadcasts from Mars, astronomers and other scientists of Tesla’s day wereopenly speculating on the reality of intelligent life on Mars. So just howfar-fetched is it to consider that someone was sending signals to Earth fromMars? Tesla never gave up the idea of communicating with other worlds. In 1931,on the occasion of his 75th birthday interview for the cover story of Timemagazine, he said the following: “I think that nothing can be more importantthan interplanetary communication. It will certainly come some day, and thecertitude that there are other human beings in the universe, working, suffering,struggling, like ourselves, will produce a magic effect on mankind and will formthe foundation of a universal brotherhood that will last as long as humanityitself.”Since early man first looked up to the heavens, Mars' ruddy glow has been anobject of fascination for generations of stargazers. The Babylonians said theplanet was Nergal, God of War. To the Greeks, Mars was their war god, Ares. TheRoman god, Mars assumed many of the characteristics and myths of Ares, and wasthe second-highest-ranking god in the Roman pantheon. Mars loved violence andbattle.According to Homer, even Jupiter, the father of Mars, recognized his son's badattitude and his love for war and death. Jupiter remarked to his son, “Of allthe gods of Olympus, I find you the most unpleasant and unlikable, for you enjoynothing but violence, war and battles. You have a stubborn and meandisposition.”In excavations at Nineveh in northern Iraq, there was discovered in the libraryof King Assurbanipal clay cylinders on which is described a voyage to the sky.It narrates how King Eitan, who lived about 5,000 years ago, was taken as anhonored guest on a flying ship in the shape of a shield which landed in a squarebehind the royal palace, rotating, surrounded by a vortex of flames. From theflying ship alighted tall, blond men with dark complexions dressed in white,handsome as gods, who invited King Eitan, to go for a trip.In the middle of a whirlwind of flames, King Eitan went so high that the Earthwith its seas, islands, continents, appeared to him as “a loaf in a basket.”King Eitan in the flying ship reached Mars, Venus and the moon. After two weeksabsence, the flying ship glided over the city (Nineveh) and touched downsurrounded by a ring of fire. King Eitan descended with some of the blond menwho stayed as his guests for several days.Of all the planets in the solar system besides Earth, Mars was thought to be themost likely to harbor intelligent life. Popular culture in the form ofliterature, radio and film, reflect such beliefs. In 1659, Dutch astronomerChristiaan Huygens (1629-1695) used a telescope of his own design and drew thefirst sketch of Mars. Huygens also recorded the first true feature on Mars, alarge dark spot, probably Syrtis Major.Observing the spot in successive rotations, he deduced a 24 hour Martian day. In1698, Huygens published COSMOTHEOROS, one of the earliest expositions onpossible extraterrestrial life on the red planet. In this book, Huygensdiscusses what is required for a planet to be capable of supporting life andspeculates about intelligent Martians.Huygens’ theories were ahead of his time as contemporary scientists loudlyridiculed the Dutch astronomer's work, calling into question his scientificintegrity and past discoveries. It was not until years later that Huygens’ earlyfindings on Mars were confirmed by astronomers using more powerful andsophisticated telescopes.The British Astronomer Frederick William Herschel (1738-1822) did variousstudies of Mars between 1777 and 1783 using small telescopes that hemanufactured himself. Herschel noted the seasonal changes of the polar caps andsuggested they were made of snow and ice. He also speculated that vegetationcould be growing during the Martian spring and summer. He wrongly consideredthat dark areas he had spotted to be oceans. Herschel believed that Mars wasinhabited; he also felt there were intelligent beings living on all the planets,even in cool areas under the hot surface of the sun.COMMUNICATING WITH MARSThe April 13, 1892 edition of the newspaper Spectator carried an articleentitled, Telegraphing to Mars with solar signals. This was one of the firstarticles that dealt with the language difficulties involved in communicatingwith the Martials, (Martials was 19th century slang for Martians). The articlepoints out that mathematical information could be exchanged, but questions howwe will communicate abstract concepts, such as “How are we to ask if Martialshave engineers and ships, and electric lights and glaciers and five senses, andheads and feet?”That same year, Nicloas Camille Flammarion published Volume one of hisencyclopedia of La Planète Mars. Flammarion suggested the natural magnetism ofthe Earth might be harnessed to propagate sounds across space in order tocommunicate with life forms on Mars.In 1877, Giovanni Schiaparelli observed and sketched what he referred to asCanali (Italian for channels) on the surface of Mars. Schiaparelli's drawingswere remarkably extensive and soon drew worldwide attention. In the early1900's, Boston astronomer Percival Lowell corroborated and added toSchiaparelli's sketches, with his small telescope, Lowell took photographs ofMars that seemed to confirm the canals' existence.Percival believed that Mars was covered with an intricate system of canals, notopen water, but instead strips of vegetation along a subterranean irrigationsystem. The theory at the time was that the main water supply on Mars came fromthe polar ice caps. Seasonal melting would distribute water to the slowly dyingplanet through a grid of underground channels.In 1954, when Mars made one of its close approaches to Earth, the NationalGeographic Society and Lowell Observatory arranged for the first worldwide “MarsPatrol.” This effort, directed by Dr. Earl Slipher of the Lowell Observatory,attempted to gather better information and photographs of features on thesurface of Mars.The results once again seemed to show what appeared to be major canal linesacross the surface of Mars, as well as evidence of vegetation that seemed togrow and then die back in connection to the Martian seasons. News of thephotographs was leaked to astronomy journals such as Sky & Telescope, but thelong-awaited public announcement of the “Mars Patrols” results never came.LIFE ON MARSIn a pamphlet titled, The Truth About Mars, written in 1956, author Ernest L.Norman claimed to have contacted the inhabitants of planet Mars. In his booklet,Norman stated that he would spend an hour each evening in meditation, and thatdue to his meditations he was contacted in February of 1955 by a man from Mars.“After introducing himself as Nur El, he quickly explained that he was from theplanet Mars, and that if I so desired, I could go there with him, to his city(in astral flight) and that he would be my personal guide.“He explained that his people were very desirous in view of all the controversygoing on, to clear up some of the so-called mysteries of Mars. Our trip there isa matter of split seconds as no craft is used or needed.“Arriving on the surface of Mars, we are at once aware of the extremely ruggedterrain, rocky hills and sandy wastes, that stretches out endlessly around us.Nur El explains that the ionosphere is very thin which leaves the surface almostunprotected from the various beta, gamma and cosmic rays. This highconcentration of rays ionizes the very rare and gaseous atmosphere and togetherwith thermal currents, creates terrific dust storms.“There is also a very thinly divided dust layer on the ionosphere which helpscreate the reddish appearance of the planet. There are also a number ofvolcanoes, three of which are of major size; one of these was just barelyvisible on the horizon trailing a thin wisp of smoke from its truncated cone.“It was also explained that as Mars has only seven degrees axis inclinationthere is not much of a seasonal change. Water is very scarce on this aridplanet; most of the precipitation falls at the poles. Vegetation is alsoscarce.”Norman continues his story saying, “On Mars the cities are underground and areconnected together by huge oval metal tubes from three to five hundred feet indiameter. It is these tubes which have confused the astronomers on the earth.Some believe them to be canals of either intelligent design, or using naturalfeatures to transport scarce water throughout the planet.“The shifting desert sands often cover or uncover them which leads to furtherconfusion inasmuch as they seem to appear and disappear. The people of Mars aresmaller than those on earth, only averaging about four feet six inches inheight.“They are somewhat Mongolian in appearance. The Martians originally migrated inspacecraft to Mars from a dying planet more than a million years ago. They alsocame to this earth and started a colony but found it impractical to maintain. Itwas also explained by Nur El that this colony became our Chinese race throughthe evolution of time.”The Martians explained to Norman that more than 100,000 years ago Mars was muchlike Earth. There was air, water, and abundant plant and animal life.At that time, through their occult science and with their superior telescopes,they saw somewhere out in space, a horrendous cataclysm. A giant sun suddenlyflared up like a nova and then exploded. Huge chunks hurtled out into space indifferent directions, each one a smaller, white-hot, “atomically-burning sun.”It was determined by calculations that one of these fiery pieces would pass veryclose to our solar system. The Martians had a choice, to stay on Mars or tomigrate to another planet far away from this solar system. After a search, itwas found that there was no other planet available that would be suitable.Therefore, they decided on an alternative…they could build huge citiesunderground.After the cataclysm struck the solar system, Mars was left decimated and burnt.Earth as well suffered; there were great earthquakes and tidal waves as Earth'sorbit and axis were changed drastically.Ernest Norman's story, while similar to other esoteric writings of the time, isinteresting because of his observations of climatic conditions on Mars that werenot known by scientists in the 1950's. His statement concerning volcanoes onMars was truly prophetic considering that at the time his booklet was written,scientists did not consider Mars to have been seismically active.With the advancement of modern rockets, Mars became one of the first planets toreceive the attention of space probes sent from Earth. Mars, though, has notbeen an easy planet to reach.In November of 1962, The Soviets launched a Mars probe, called Mars 1, which wasto rendezvous with the planet in June of 1963. However, just ten weeks beforethe scheduled encounter, the Soviets lost contact with the spacecraft. Threeyears later the Soviets launched another probe called Zond 2, which was set tofly by Mars. This probe as well lost contact with Earth in April 1965.In 1969, the United States sent the Mariner 7 probe to the red planet. In 1970the probe lost radio communications with Earth, started tumbling out of control,its battery went dead, and the spacecrafts velocity increased.Mysteriously, a few hours later Mariner 7 suddenly ceased tumbling, radiocommunications were restored and the spacecraft's velocity returned to normal,despite the fact that its rocket system was inoperative. Nervous scientistsbegan joking about “The Great Galactic Ghoul” lying in wait for unsuspectingspacecraft to fly by.After the strange events surrounding the flight of Mariner 7, Time Magazinecorrespondent Donald Neff came up with the term the Great Galactic Ghoul. “Thelegend of the Great Galactic Ghoul is like the legend of the Bermuda Triangle,”commented John Casani of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.The Soviets as well continued to lose Mars probes. On July 12, 1988 the USSRlaunched Phobos II, an unmanned satellite to Mars. It arrived in January 1989and entered an orbit around Mars as the first phase towards it's realdestination, the small Martian moon called Phobos.The mission was flawless until the craft aligned itself with the moon. On March28, 1989 an elliptical object was detected moving towards the satellite secondsbefore it lost communication with Earth. All indications were that theelliptical object had possibly attacked the satellite that was now dead and leftspinning out of control.On March 28, 1989, Tass, the official Soviet news agency stated: “Phobos IIfailed to communicate with Earth as scheduled after completing and operationyesterday around the Martian moon Phobos. Scientists at mission control havebeen unable to establish stable radio contact.”The next day a top official of the Soviet Space Agency (Glavkosmos) said:“Phobos II is 99% lost for good.”On March 31 1989 headlines dispatched by the Moscow correspondents of theEuropean News Agency (EFE) stated: “Phobos II Captured Strange Photos of MarsBefore Losing Contact With It's Base. Vremya revealed yesterday that the spaceprobe Phobos II, which was orbiting above Mars when Soviet scientists lostcontact with it on Monday, had photographed an UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT on theMartian surface seconds before losing contact.”Scientists described the unidentified object as a thin ellipse 20 kilometerslong. It was further stated that the photos could not be an illusion because twodifferent color cameras captured it as well as cameras taking infrared shots.One controller at the Kaliningrad control center concluded that the probe wasnow unresponsive and spinning out of control. It would seem that somethingstruck or shot the Phobos II probe. In the October 19, 1989 issue of Naturemagazine, Soviet scientists concluded that the craft could be spinning becausesome unknown object had impacted it.Recent attempts to reach Mars have also met with mysterious and frustratingfailures. On September 23 1999, nine months of space flight to Mars ended indisaster when NASAs first interplanetary weather satellite was destroyed. It isthought that the Mars Climate Orbiter entered Mars’ atmosphere at too steep anangle and broke up or burned in the atmosphere.The 1,387-pound orbiter was believed to have come within 37 miles of Mars’surface. Project manager Richard Cook, of NASA's jet propulsion laboratory,said: “We believe the spacecraft came in at a lower altitude than we predicted.”Ten weeks later, in early December, the Mars Polar Lander and its two detachableprobes mysteriously disappeared after what was thought to be an almost flawlessmission. The final communication from Mars Polar Lander prior to landingindicated it was on course and working fine.The spacecraft turned its antenna away from Earth, 12 minutes before landing toorient itself for entry into the Martian atmosphere. Its last radio signalsarrived at Earth 14 minutes later, at 3:03 p.m. ET.The $165 million NASA probe was designed to slice through Mars’ thin atmosphereat a 12.25-degree angle, the margin of error was just half a degree, separatefrom its heat shield, deploy a parachute and fire a dozen thrusters beforesetting down C all without radio contact with Earth.After touching down, the lander was to have unfurled its solar panels anddeployed its antenna, and a few minutes later, radioed a message back to Earth.Also silent were the two basketball-size Deep Space 2 microprobes that wereriding along with the lander.The microprobes were to slam into the planet at 400 mph as the main spacecraftdescended, their fall unbroken by parachutes or thrusters. NASA controllers didnot receive any signals from the two microprobes during the contactopportunities.To this day, nothing was ever heard from the Polar Lander or its separateprobes. While NASA was accused of covering up earlier reports that the Marsmission was doomed from the start due to human errors - the ultimate fate of thePolar Lander is shrouded in mystery.It is almost as if someone or something is deliberately trying to stop our spaceprobes from reaching Mars. This scenario on the surface seems absurd, but is it?CIVILIZATIONS ON MARSIn 1959 a Martian spacecraft reportedly landed in the wilderness outside ofMoscow, in the Soviet Union, where a secret meeting with Soviet Premier NikitaKruschev was arranged. The conference regarded improving relations with Earth,exchanging knowledge, and securing world and interplanetary peace, yet theSoviet government rejected the terms. This report originated from Sgt. WillardWannall, formerly of Army Intelligence, who investigated UFOs in Hawaii while inthe military in the 1950's.On April 24, 1964, an oval shaped metallic flying object landed in a farm fieldin Newark Valley in New York State, and two alien beings emerged from theestimated 20 foot long craft. Farmer, Gary Wilcox drove his tractor toward theobject clearly visible on a bright sunny day. The farmer kicked the metallicobject to make sure it was real.The two occupants were about four feet tall, and they carried a square tray fullof the different vegetables they had collected from his farm. Wilcox reportedthat when he confronted the beings stealing his crops, they said, “Don't bealarmed, we have spoken to people before.”Gary described the voices as being very strange. They wore white,metallic-looking overalls without seams, stitching or pockets. He could not seetheir hands or feet. Nor could he see their faces beneath the full spacesuits,which Wilcox speculated were protecting these aliens from the poisons in Earth'satmosphere.As Wilcox became inquisitive, one of them stated, “We are from what you know asthe planet Mars. We can only come to Earth every two years,” and left a warningthat Earth people should stay out of space. They said that they were studyingthe organic materials on Earth because of the rocky structure of Mars, and thatthey did not fly near our cities because they avoided the air pollution.Wilcox gave the beings a bag of fertilizer and exchanged information aboutagriculture and mankind's attempts at space flight. Wilcox was laterinvestigated by a psychiatrist and the sheriff department, who found him anormal, truthful person with no apparent emotional problems.In February 1972, United Nations diplomat Farida Iskiovet, who investigated UFOsand occupant contacts for the President of the General Assembly, revealed thatshe had been contacted by a landed spacecraft from the planet Mars. The reportedcontact took place in the Mojave Desert, in California, in 1971, and made thefront page\" of the major Arizona newspaper the daily Arizona Republic.This story also made the front page of the San Clemente Sun-Post in an articlewritten by Fred Swegles. Farida stated that the alien offered to admit anambassador to their interplanetary confederation in this solar system, inexchange for an alien ambassador to the General Assembly of the United Nations.Allegedly, this was an attempt to re-establish diplomatic relations with Earthand other planets that had been suspended in ancient times due to hostility onEarth. However, the terms of this peace arrangement were not acceptable to theSecurity Council, and the exchange was allegedly rejected in a secret meetingheld in New York.Tesla may have been the first to hear strange radio transmissions from space,but he certainly was not the last. Some of the world's leading astronomers haverevealed that they have collected more than 100 unexplained radio signals duringroutine surveillance of space. These faint, pure tones have no natural originand could have been created artificially, the scientists said. They do not ruleout the astonishing possibility that this strange radio traffic could haveextraterrestrial origins. Most of the signals have been picked up by Americanradio telescopes managed by the Search for Extra-Terrestrial IntelligenceInstitute (SETI) in Mountain View, California, set up in 1988 to study radiostatic in space and scan it for material that could be evidence of aliencontact. A few have also been logged by British astronomers studying stars andgalaxies with the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank, near Macclesfield inCheshire.“It's tempting to hypothesize that at least some of these seductive signals weretruly from ET and that they vanished from the ether when the extraterrestrialsturned off their transmitters or otherwise went off air before we could verifythe message,” said Dr Seth Shostak, SETI's public programs scientist.Alternatively, he said, it was possible they were simply the product of somekind of local interference that did not repeat when the astronomers tried torelocate the rogue signals.SETI, which was formed by scientists including Carl Sagan and received fundingfrom NASA until 1993, has reportedly yet to discover any clear, repeated radiopattern that might hint at the existence of alien intelligence in the universe.The short, indistinct signals are not considered good evidence of ET.“If you could hear the signal at the frequency it is received, it would soundlike a faint whistle, a pure tone which could only be made by a transmitter. Asfar as we know, nature can't make a pure sound,” said Shostak. Each time one ofthese signals is detected by a radio telescope, an alarm alerts SETIastronomers, who work around the clock. None has yet been pinpointed or recordeda second time, so that scientists have been denied the chance of making a studyof their source or composition.“I'm sure there are signals that have come and gone that we couldn't get to thebottom of. That's not to say it's little green men trying to communicate withus, but we just don't know,” said Dr Tom Muxlow, an astronomer at the Britishradio astronomy observatory. He disclosed that Jodrell Bank had picked up aboutsix rogue signals.The possibility that the signals have extra-terrestrial origins cannot beignored, according to Nobel laureate Tony Hewish, emeritus professor of radioastronomy at Cambridge University. In 1967 Hewish and Jocelyn Bell, a student,believed they had found evidence of an alien first contact when they detected aregular pulse of radio signals coming from a distant star.“It all had an air of unreality about it, but for a month we thought it waspossible that the signals were coming from intelligent life on another planet.When radio astronomers pick up signals that are very peculiar they take it witha big pinch of salt, but you cannot remove the possibility,” said Hewish.Instead, they had found a pulsar, a rapidly spinning neutron star, a discoveryfor which Hewish won a Nobel Prize in 1974.[Image00003.gif]CHAPTER FOUR EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCESMuch has been made over Tesla’s amazing ability to visualize images from hismind. This talent came mostly involuntarily and often at inopportune moments.When he was younger, Tesla worried that he was suffering from some sort ofmadness when his visions would appear. Later he came to realize that thisparticular trait was a gift and the basis of all his inventions.Tesla’s visions were so vivid that he was sometimes unsure of what was real andwhat imaginary. Strong flashes of light often accompanied these images. He wouldwave his hand in front of his eyes to determine whether the objects were simplyin his mind or outside.In 1919, Tesla wrote of these images and of his efforts to find an explanationfor them. He had consulted with several doctors and psychologists, but no onewas able to help.“The theory I have formulated is that the images were the result of a reflexaction from the brain on the retina under great excitation. They certainly werenot hallucinations, for in other respects I was normal and composed.“To give and idea of my distress, suppose that I had witnessed a funeral or somesuch nerve wracking spectacle. Then, inevitably, in the stillness of the night,a vivid picture of the scene would thrust itself before my eyes and persistdespite all my efforts to banish it. Sometimes it would even remain fixed inspace though I pushed my hand through it.”It is well known that Tesla’s conception of his AC (alternating current) motorcame to him during one of his visions. “One afternoon . . . I was enjoying awalk with my friend in the city park and reciting poetry. At that age I knewentire books by heart, word for word. One of these was Goethes Faust. The sunwas just setting and reminded me of a glorious passage: The glow retreats, doneis the day of toil; It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring; Ah, that nowing can lift me from the soil Upon its tract to follow, follow soaring!“As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash of lightning andin an instant the truth was revealed. I drew with a stick on the sand thediagram shown six years later in my address before the American institute ofElectrical Engineers.“The images were wonderfully sharp and clear and had the solidity of metal. ‘Seemy motor here; watch me reverse it.’”Tesla used his incredible power throughout his amazing career. He dislikeddrawing his conceptions down onto paper because they lacked the reality thatTesla’s internal drawing board could provide. For Tesla, drawing was utterlyunrealistic and a nuisance. He did not have to make plans and jot downdimensions, because of this power of instant recall. He could store any designsin his mind to be retrieved intact years later. Despite his unusual abilities,Tesla at first had little patience with those who believed in psychic powers orspirits. Tesla often denied that he had supernatural powers or origins frombeyond the earth. Such allegations, along with his conviction in the reality ofextraterrestrials, almost certainly hurt Tesla’s reputation later in his life.Tesla felt so strongly about such claims that he frequently wrote about hisfrustrations with people who wanted to believe that he was more than an ordinaryhuman being.“The by far greater number of human beings are never aware of what is passingaround and within them and millions fall victims of disease and die prematurelyjust on this account. The commonest, everyday occurrences appear to themmysterious and inexplicable.“One may feel a sudden wave of sadness and rack his brain for an explanation,when he might have noticed that it was caused by a cloud cutting off the rays ofthe sun. He may see the image of a friend dear to him under conditions that heconstrues as very peculiar, when only shortly before he has passed him in thestreet or seen his photograph somewhere.“When he loses a collar button, he fusses and swears for an hour, being unableto visualize his previous actions and locate the object directly. Deficientobservation is merely a form of ignorance and responsible for the many morbidnotions and foolish ideas prevailing.“There is not more than one out of every ten persons who does not believe intelepathy and other psychic manifestations, spiritualism and communion with thedead, and who would refuse to listen to willing or unwilling deceivers?“Just to illustrate how deeply rooted this tendency has become even among theclear-headed American population, I may mention a comical incident. Shortlybefore the war, when the exhibition of my turbines in this city elicitedwidespread comment in the technical papers, I anticipated that there would be ascramble among manufacturers to get hold of the invention and I had particulardesigns on that man from Detroit (Ford) who has an uncanny faculty foraccumulating millions.“So confident was I that he would turn up some day that I declared this ascertain to my secretary and assistants. Sure enough, one fine morning a body ofengineers from the Ford Motor Company presented themselves with the request ofdiscussing with me an important project.“Didn't I tell you?’ I remarked triumphantly to my employees, and one of themsaid…‘You are amazing, Mr. Tesla. Everything always comes out exactly as youpredict.’“As soon as these hard-headed men were seated, I of course, immediately began toextol the wonderful features of my turbine, when the spokesman interrupted meand said, ‘We know all about this, but we are on a special errand. We haveformed a psychological society for the investigation of psychic phenomena and wewant you to join us in this undertaking.’“I suppose these engineers never knew how near they came to being fired out ofmy office. Ever since I was told by some of the greatest men of the time,leaders in science whose names are immortal, that I am possessed of an unusualmind, I bent all my thinking faculties on the solution of great problemsregardless of sacrifice. For many years I endeavored to solve the enigma ofdeath, and watched eagerly for every kind of spiritual indication. But only oncein the course of my existence have I had an experience which momentarilyimpressed me as supernatural.“It was at the time of my mother's death. I had become completely exhausted bypain and long vigilance, and one night was carried to a building about twoblocks from our home.“As I lay helpless there, I thought that if my mother died while I was away fromher bedside, she would surely give me a sign. Two or three months before, I wasin London in company with my late friend, Sir William Crookes, when spiritualismwas discussed and I was under the full sway of these thoughts.“I might not have paid attention to other men, but was susceptible to hisarguments as it was his epochal work on radiant matter, which I had read as astudent, that made me embrace the electrical career. I reflected that theconditions for a look into the beyond were most favorable, for my mother was awoman of genius and particularly excelling in the powers of intuition.“During the whole night every fiber in my brain was strained in expectancy, butnothing happened until early in the morning, when I fell in a sleep, or perhapsa swoon, and saw a cloud carrying angelic figures of marvelous beauty, one ofwhom gazed upon me lovingly and gradually assumed the features of my mother.“The appearance slowly floated across the room and vanished, and I was awakenedby an indescribably sweet song of many voices. In that instant a certitude,which no words can express, came upon me that my mother had just died. And thatwas true.“I was unable to understand the tremendous weight of the painful knowledge Ireceived in advance, and wrote a letter to Sir William Crookes while still underthe domination of these impressions and in poor bodily health.“When I recovered, I sought for a long time the external cause of this strangemanifestation and, to my great relief; I succeeded after many months offruitless effort. I had seen the painting of a celebrated artist, representingallegorically one of the seasons in the form of a cloud with a group of angelswhich seemed to actually float in the air, and this had struck me forcefully.“It was exactly the same that appeared in my dream, with the exception of mymother's likeness. The music came from the choir in the church nearby at theearly mass of Easter morning, explaining everything satisfactorily in conformitywith scientific facts.”As Tesla grew older, he became more interested in spirituality and mankind’splace in the universe. Tesla had remarked once about inventing a machine thatcould project human thoughts onto a screen, much like a modern television. Thisidea would continue to be on his mind up until the time of his death.Dale Alfrey remembers several notations concerning Tesla’s ideas on the natureof the human spirit and whether it continues after physical death. Tesla hadbeen brought up in a religious environment— but he had become more “humanistic”in his attitudes and considered physical life to be no more than a “automationof nature.”“Tesla became more open to the idea that there is a spirit or soul thatcontinues in another plane of existence after death,” recalls Alfrey. “At onepoint Tesla even chided Edison for stealing his idea on trying to develop a typeof radio to contact the dead.”VOICES IN THE AETHERAfter his initial reception of enigmatic radio signals in 1899, Tesla worked formany years to perfect the receiving and transmitting equipment that was neededto better pick up and translate the possible alien broadcasts. At first thesignals were nothing more than rhythmic sounds, almost a Morse code type oftransmission he reported.Around 1918, Tesla started to receive what he considered to be voicetransmissions, except the voices he was picking up were not human. Instead,Tesla wrote, “The sounds I am listening to every night at first appear to behuman voices conversing back and forth in a language I cannot understand. I findit difficult to imagine that I am actually hearing real voices from people notof this planet. There must be a more simple explanation that has so far eludedme.”In 1925, Tesla wrote, “I am hearing more phrases in these transmissions that aredefinitely in English, French and German. If it were not for the fact that thefrequencies I am monitoring are unusable for terrestrial radio stations, I wouldthink that I am listening to people somewhere in the world talking to eachother. This cannot be the case as these signals are coming from points in thesky above the Earth.”Nikola Tesla may have been one of the first to receive strange radio signalsthat he thought were from beyond Earth, but he certainly wasn’t the last. It isnow known in the journals of fortean that mysterious messages claimingextraterrestrial origins are being received repeatedly by ordinary, householdelectronics. Startled witnesses have reported strange signals emanating fromturned off televisions and radios, as well as weird phone calls filled withelectronic sounds and whispering voices.In the early days of radio experimentation, hobbyists were amazed when theirprimitive sets would suddenly burst forth with strong, clear signals, far morepowerful then any existing station at the time. The signals have often beenexplained away as normal radio interference caused by the weather or othernatural sources.In 1965, Soviet scientists Gennady B. Sholomitsky, Nikolai Kardashev and I. S.Shklovskii, received worldwide attention when they announced that they hadreceived radio signals from beacons of some super-civilization in space. Thesesignals, they said, were ordered and indicative of interplanetary intelligence.Later, other radio astronomers discovered that these signals were coming fromcelestial bodies that we now know as quasars. Other strange radio signals havenot been as easily explained. Dr. Hugh Mansfield Robinson, conducting a set ofradio experiments in 1921, received intelligent signals on thethirty-thousand-meter wavelength. Ernest B. Rogers, the engineer in charge ofthe test felt compelled to state that “the signals were of extraterrestrialorigin, as there were no sending instruments of that power on Earth at thattime.”An amateur radio astronomer named Grote Reber reported receiving strongdot-and-dash signals from space in 1939. He had build a thirty-foot dish antennain Wheaton, Illinois and said he often listened to the signals for eight hoursat a time. They seemed to come from one specific spot in the sky.None of these early, mysterious signals have ever been explained.LONG DELAYED ECHOESRadio enthusiasts in the 1920s discovered a phenomenon that they labeled LDE(Long Delayed Echoes). Signals sent out from earth sometimes came bouncing backseveral seconds later, as if they had been reflected back by something in space.In a few instances some LDEs returned days, months, even years later.Researchers in Europe reported LDE’s in 1927, 1928 and 1934. The echo pulseswere delayed from three to fifteen seconds.Dr. Ronald N. Bracewell of Stanford University speculated in 1962 that an aliensatellite equipped with a computer which would scan all radio frequencies as ittraveled through space, could be responsible for the strange LDEs. The satellitewould pick up intelligent signals, record them and then rebroadcast it back onthe same frequency.Suppose, he thought, that the satellite was programmed so that if the messagewas returned again, indicating the system was understood, it would then transmita message of its own. The LDEs of the 1920s could have come from such asatellite suggested Bracewell.In the weekly scientific journal Nature, there appears in the issue of November3, 1928, a letter written by one Jorgen Hals, a radio engineer of Bygodo, Oslo,to physicist Carl Stormer.“At the end of the summer of 1927 I repeatedly heard signals from the Dutchshort-wave transmitting station PCJJ at Eindhoven. At the same time as I heardthese I also heard echoes. I heard the usual echo which goes round the Earthwith an interval of about 1/7th of a second as well as a weaker echo about threeseconds after the principal echo had gone.“When the principal signal was especially strong, I suppose the amplitude forthe last echo three seconds later, lay between 1/10 and 1/20 of the principalsignal in strength. From where this echo comes I cannot say for the present, Ican only confirm that I really heard it.”Stormer initiated certain tests as a result of this communication and on October11, 1928, these achieved some success. During the afternoon of that day StationPCJJ in Eindhoven emitted very strong signals on 31.4 meters.Both Hals and Stormer heard very distinct echoes several times, the intervalbetween signal and echo varying between three and five seconds, most of themcoming back about eight seconds after the principal signal. Sometimes two echoeswere heard with an interval of about four seconds. Physicist Van der Polconfirmed these observations in a telegram that read: “Last night specialemission gave echoes here varying between three and 15 seconds. 50% of echoesheard after eight seconds!” At the time, Stormer attributed these peculiarlylong echoes to auroral causes but the feeling today is that they have never beenadequately explained. Six years later, in 1934, radio echoes of a similar kindfrom Holland were also heard.A young Scottish astronomer named Duncan Lunan reviewed the LDE records of the1920s and set out to decode them. He laid out the LDE data on a graph, usingdots to represent the pauses between echoes. To his astonishment, a map began totake shape.“The dots made up a map of an easily-recognized constellation,” Lunan said. “TheConstellation of Bootis in the northern sky. The curious pattern of delayedechoes was actually a pattern of star positions.” Lunan worked up other LDE mapsand found that they all seemed to center around Epsilon Bootis, a star in theconstellation.Lunan speculated that the LDEs were indicating that the point of origin for thealien satellite was the star system Epsilon Bootis. Lunan submitted his findingsto the British Interplanetary Society. Kenneth Gatland, vice president of thesociety was enthusiastic about Lunan’s findings.“Lunan’s findings are utterly astounding. I have studied the maps and must cometo the same conclusions he did.”Unusual radio broadcasts are often reported in areas of high UFO activity. InJanuary 1954, people throughout the Midwest heard a voice coming throughturned-off radios.The voice, speaking in a dull monotone, stated, “I wish no one to be afraid,although I speak from space. But if you do not stop your preparations for war,you will be destroyed.” This type of unusual broadcast has been heard bystartled listeners worldwide. No earthly hoaxer was ever been caught orconfessed.On August 3, 1958, radio ham operators throughout the United States reportedlypicked up a strange broadcast on the seventy-five-meter international band. Amale voice claiming to be “Nacoma from the planet Jupiter” warned his listenersthat the atomic bomb tests could lead to disaster. The voice spoke fortwo-and-a-half hours in English, German, Norwegian and his own language,described as a kind of musical gibberish.“It was the most powerful signal ever picked up,” one account said. “There wasplenty of time during the broadcast for hundreds to listen, and radio operatorscalled in friends and neighbors and phoned long distance to relatives in otherstates to listen in.”Author John Keel wrote in the September 1977 issue of UFO Report that while inWest Virginia, he visited a radio hobbyist and listened to strange sounds on ahomemade VLF (Very Low Frequency) radio set.“Strange voices were chattering back and forth on frequencies that supposedlycannot carry voice transmission. They spoke in a rapid-fire guttural language wecould not identify. At first I thought it might be ordinary people speakingthrough a ‘scrambler,’ but later I sought out and listened to samples of voicetransmissions through different kinds of scramblers and there was nosimilarity.”According to the Spanish newspaper El Diario De Nueva York, on January 31, 1950,UFO activity over Madrid, Spain was accompanied by unusual radio broadcasts.“In the last two days, near midnight, intense phosphorescence and the forms ofstrange lights have been observed at the same time. They have passed through thesky from north to south, and radio receivers have heard, during the occurrenceof this phenomenon, words pronounced in an incomprehensible tongue. Popularfancy supposes that these luminous signals may come from the planet Mars.”Strange voices speaking a guttural, unknown language has been often associatedwith inexplicable radio broadcasts. Nor has this phenomena been contained toanecdotal tales from untrained individuals. Since its inception, NASA hasexperienced unauthorized radio interference problems of one form or another onpractically every manned space mission.A good example was the Mercury Faith 7 flight with Astronaut Gordon Cooper. OnMay 15, 1963, during his forth pass over Hawaii, Cooper’s voice transmission wassuddenly interrupted and drowned out by “an unintelligible foreign languagetransmission” on the channel reserved for space flights—a frequency which few ifany amateurs were equipped to broadcast on.If the signal came from the ground, it had to come from Hawaii, but the FCCnever solved the mystery. NASA recorded the transmission, which sounded like avoice grunting and speaking rapidly in a language that has never beenidentified.THE SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCEIn 1955, two Cornell University physicists, Giuseppi Cocconi and PhilipMorrison, published a paper suggesting it might be possible to use microwaveradio to communicate between the stars. By pointing a radio telescope at a nearby, Sun-like star that might have planets, astronomers might be able to detectradio waves generated by intelligent life there. Since 1960, scientificresearchers have carried on The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).Radio waves are considered the best means available, given current technology,for trying to detect extra-terrestrial intelligence. Radio waves travel at thespeed of light (which is the fastest theoretical speed possible) that is about300,000 kilometers a second.At this speed, a signal sent from our nearest neighbor star, Proxima Centauri,takes over four years to reach Earth. This may seem like a long time, but thefastest space probe currently built would take 300,000 years to make the sametrip.Radio astronomer Frank Drake was the first to attempt a SETI search by using an85-foot antenna at Greenbank, West Virginia, to listen in the direction of twonearby stars, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani. For two months he monitored thestars for signals at 1,420 MHz, a frequency associated with hydrogen, that waschosen as a logical channel to listen to because of its astronomicalsignificance (Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe).Unfortunately, Drakes project achieved no positive results. Additional SETIprograms were conducted in the Soviet Union through the 1960's but the nextserious attempt in the United States wasn't made until the early 70's whenNASA's Ames Research Center put together a team of experts to consider how aneffective search could be done.The result was known as Project Cyclops. Radio astronomers, using the work inthe Cyclops report, started conducting searches throughout the 70's usingexisting antennas and receivers.THE “WOW!” SIGNALIn 1977, Dr. Jerry Ehman was involved in a search for signals of an artificialorigin using the “Big Ear” antenna (now replaced by a golf course) at Ohio StateUniversity. Out of this effort came one of the most interesting, and mystifying,signals to date. Known as the “Wow!” signal (after the exclamation written byDr. Ehman next to a particularly tantalizing part of the computer printout), itstill remains unexplained.The “Wow!” source radio emission entered the receiver of the Big Ear radiotelescope at about 11:16 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time on August 15, 1977.Dr. Ehman had worked at OSU as an assistant professor in electrical engineeringand astronomy. When the National Science Foundation cut funding to the Big Earin 1972, Dr. Ehman was let go, but he stayed on as a volunteer.“A few days after the August 15, 1977 detection, I began my routine review ofthe computer printout from the multi-day run that began on August 15th. Severalpages into the computer printout I was astonished to see the string of numbersand characters ‘6EQUJ5’ in channel 2 of the printout.“I immediately recognized this as the pattern we would expect to see from anarrowband radio source of small angular diameter in the sky. In the red pen Iwas using I immediately circled those six characters and wrote the notation‘Wow!’ in the left margin of the computer printout opposite them.“After I completed the review of the rest of the printout, I contacted Bob Dixonand Dr. John D. Kraus, the Director of the Big Ear Radio Observatory. They wereastonished too. Then we began an analysis of what has been called for more then20 years the ‘Wow!’ source.”Could the signal actually be of extraterrestrial origin? Ohio State Universityresearchers weren't sure. They trained the massive scope on that part of the skyfor the next month, but the signal was never recorded again.Dr. Ehman, who has continued his research on the “Wow!” signal, writes thatafter more than twenty years, the signal remains a mystery.“Even if it were intelligent beings sending a signal, they'd do it far more thanonce,” Ehman says. “We should have seen it when we looked for it again. At thispoint we have eliminated any terrestrial sources for the signal. Thus, since allof the possibilities of a terrestrial origin have been either ruled out or seemimprobable, and since the possibility of an extraterrestrial origin has not beenruled out, I must conclude that an ETI (Extraterrestrial Intelligence) mighthave sent the signal that we received as the “Wow!” source. Of course, being ascientist, I await the reception of additional signals like the ‘Wow!’ sourcethat are able to be received and analyzed by many observatories. Thus, I muststate that the origin of the ‘Wow!’ signal is still an open question for me.There is simply too little data to draw many conclusions. In other words, Ichoose not to draw vast conclusions from 'half-vast' data.”Curious signals were picked up from 12 stars by the 300-foot radio telescope atGreen Bank, WV, according to an article published in the January 29, 1978edition of The Baltimore Sun. The signals took the form of strong bursts at awavelength of 21 cm, one of the wavelengths characteristic of the hydrogenmolecule.Unfortunately, the signals were so short that their information content, if any,could not be recorded, and since the bursts were not repeated (except for asecond burst from Barnard's Star), some natural phenomenon may be at work ratherthan intelligent communicators, who would presumably be more persistent.The peculiar signals, which had never been recorded before, were discovered aspart of Project Ozma II, in which radio astronomers listened to 21-cm radiowaves from hundreds of nearby stars. SETI is stepping up efforts to increase itschances of relocating one of these signals and has secured the use of theworld’s largest radio telescope at Arecibo in Puerto Rico.SETI scientists are also negotiating with British astronomers to launch afive-year project to allow speedy verification and tracking of these elusivenoises. Whenever SETI identifies a suspect signal, radio telescopes at JodrellBank will scan the same section of the sky to locate it. In this way, thescientists can rule out possible terrestrial interference from radar, airplanes,even microwave ovens as a cause.“I'm sure there are signals that have come and gone that we couldn't get to thebottom of. That's not to say it's little green men trying to communicate withus, but we just don't know,” said Dr Tom Muxlow, an astronomer at the Britishradio astronomy observatory. He disclosed that Jodrell Bank had picked up aboutsix rogue signals.The possibility that the signals have extra-terrestrial origins cannot beignored, according to Nobel laureate Tony Hewish, emeritus professor of radioastronomy at Cambridge University. In 1967 Hewish and Jocelyn Bell, a student,believed they had found evidence of an alien first contact when they detected aregular pulse of radio signals coming from a distant star.“It all had an air of unreality about it, but for a month we thought it waspossible that the signals were coming from intelligent life on another planet.When radio astronomers pick up signals that are very peculiar they take it witha big pinch of salt, but you cannot remove the possibility,” said Hewish.Instead, they had found a pulsar, a rapidly spinning neutron star, a discoveryfor which Hewish won a Nobel Prize in 1974.Shostak is not put off by the prospect that any signal from an alien world wouldprobably be indecipherable. “If we heard from an ET, it would be from acivilization that is a long way ahead of us, maybe even a million years moreadvanced than we are,” he said.Recently, Peter Backus, of Project Phoenix in California, believed that he waslistening to messages from outer space via the 64-meter Parkes radio telescopein Australia. The telescope, the biggest in the southern hemisphere, picked up adistinct, but inexplicable, radio signal around 2.4 gigahertz at about the sametime each evening.However, a thorough investigation revealed that the scientists were notlistening to other planets communicating through space. Instead, they wereeavesdropping on meals cooking in the microwave oven downstairs.“It was pretty loud,” Dr. Backus told the annual meeting of the AmericanAstronomical Society in San Antonio. “One time I tracked one signal for twohours. I couldn't rule it out as human noise. I was just about to tell mycolleagues when I realized that the signal was suspiciously linked to breaktimes.”[Image00004.gif]CHAPTER FIVE TESLA AND ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENANo one can deny that computers and electronics have forever changed our way oflife. There are electronic controls and computer chips in everything from thesmall appliances that toast our bread to the cars we drive, and make possiblemyriad forms of new entertainment, from VCRs and DVDs to video games and talkingstuffed toys.For a number of years some people have claimed that electronics can be useful ina quite unexpected way: to contact the dead, or at least allow the dead tocontact us. Obviously, these claims are highly controversial. They make manyassumptions: that there is life after death, that the dead are interested incontacting us, and that they have the means by which to do so.The mysterious signals that Tesla received could be linked to what is now knownas Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP). Tesla was one of the first men toexperiment with the necessary electronic receiving equipment. The very sameequipment, albeit more sophisticated than Tesla had access to, is being usedtoday to receive EVP.Many people experimenting with Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) and InstrumentalTranscommunication (ITC) say they have received messages from “the other side”through radios, tape recorders, VCRs, televisions, telephones, and evencomputers.These phenomena have manifested themselves since the appearance of theinstruments themselves. EVP, for example, has been reported for well over 50years or more: Strange voices being picked up with primitive radios during WWIand heard faintly on magnetic recording tape.Tesla may have been the first to receive these electronic voices from anotherplane of reality. As with other modes of communications with alleged discarnateentities, one should not be swayed by the stories often told by beings from theother side. Tesla may have been duped, so-to-speak, by voices that onlypretended to be creatures from other planets.This is nothing new to those who are familiar with the tall tales told to themby spirits who claim to be ascended masters, Abraham Lincoln or Ashtar of theInterplanetary Space Command. Spirits love to tell lies to anyone who willlisten.Those such as Tesla and Marconi who experimented with radio early on were thefirst to report anomalous sounds and voices emanating from their radioreceivers. These early reports were looked upon as mildly interestingcuriosities and quickly forgotten. However, there were those who realized thatthis new technology could also be used to communicate beyond the earthly realm.In 1936, Theosophist Alice Bailey transcribed these words of her great teacher,the Tibetan Master DK, “Within the next few years the fact of the eternity ofexistence will have advanced from the realm of questioning into the realm ofcertainty. Through the use of the radio by those who have passed over, willcommunication be set up and reduced to a true science.”It has been widely written that Edison and his assistant, Dr. Miller Hutchinson,were seriously at work building a machine to achieve spirit communication. Teslawrote in his journals that Thomas Edison had heard from other engineers thatTesla had been receiving mysterious voices and sounds over radio frequenciesthat were not conducive for the broadcasting of the human voice.Edison, who publicly mocked Tesla and his experiments, privately believed thatTesla had managed to find the correct frequency to enable communication withspirits of the dead. Edison was determined to discover Tesla’s secret, and bethe first to get the “Spirit Phone” on the market.In his diary, Dr. Miller Hutchinson wrote, “Edison and I are convinced that inthe fields of psychic research will yet be discovered facts that will prove ofgreater significance to the thinking of the human race than all the inventionswe have ever made in the field of electricity.”Edison failed to live long enough to succeed with his ill-gotten idea to bestTesla. Tesla simply noted in his journal that Edison was trying to use hispatents to talk with specters. Edison thought that Tesla could listen tospirits, Tesla considered that he was hearing people from other planets B thevoices could have been the same, they may have just changed their stories to fitthe belief system of the listener.In 1967, Edison allegedly spoke through West German clairvoyant SigrunSeuterman, in trance, about his earlier efforts to develop equipment forrecording voices from the beyond. Edison also made suggestions as to how tomodify TV sets and tune them to 740 megahertz to get paranormal effects.(Session recorded on tape by Paul Affolter, Liestal, Switzerland).On September 15, 1952, two Catholic priests, Father Ernetti and Father Gemilliwere collaborating on a musical research project; Ernetti as an internationallyrespected scientist, physicist, philosopher and music lover, and Gemilli asPresident of the Papal Academy.The two men were trying to record a Gregorian chant, but a wire in theirequipment kept breaking. Exasperated, Gemilli looked up and asked his deadfather for help. To his amazement, his fathers voice was heard saying: “Ofcourse I shall help you. I'm always with you.” They repeated the experiment, andthe voice, even clearer than before, said: “But Zucchini, it is clear, don't youknow it is I?”Gemilli was astonished. No one knew his childhood nickname but his father. Thepriest was suddenly afraid, for as a Catholic priest he had no right to speakwith the dead. Troubled, the two men eventually sought an audience with PopePius XII in Rome.Gemilli told the Pontiff of his experience, and to his surprise, was reassured.According to the 1990 translated text of his meeting, Pope Pius told Gemilli,“You really need not worry about this. The existence of this voice is strictly ascientific fact and has nothing whatsoever to do with spiritism. The recorder istotally objective. It records sound waves from wherever they come. Thisexperiment may be a cornerstone for scientific studies which will strengthenpeople's faith in a hereafter.”Two men from California, the medium Attila von Szalay and paranormal researcherRaymond Bayless, continued research in Electronic Voice Phenomena, and in 1956,they recorded, quite by chance, a series of paranormal voices on magnetic tape,voices that should not logically have been there. Though Bayless reported theirexperiments in the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, likeTesla years before, not a single person contacted the society or the researchersto enquire about their work.It was not until 1959 when Friedrich Juergenson, a film producer in Sweden,first made public his amazing voice recordings, did the world sit up and takenotice of the Tesla voice phenomena.Juergenson, while making a documentary, had decided to try and tape bird songs.When he played the tape back he was startled to hear, in among the tweeting andchirping, what sounded like his mother's voice say in German: “Friedrich, youare being watched. Friedel, my little Friedel, can you hear me?”Years later, Juergenson said that when he heard his mother's voice he wasconvinced he had made “an important discovery.”RADIO CONTACT WITH THE DEAD?In 1967, Juergenson's Radio Contact with the Dead was translated into German,and Latvian psychologist Dr. Konstantin Raudive read it skeptically. He visitedJuergenson to learn his methodology, decided to experiment on his own, and soonbegan developing his own experimental techniques.Like Juergenson, Raudive too heard the voice of his own deceased mother, whocalled him by his boyhood name: “Kostulit, this is your mother.” Eventually hecatalogued tens of thousands of voices, many under strict laboratory conditions.He published his book, Unhoerbares Wird Hoerbar (The Inaudible Becomes Audible),based on 72,000 voices he recorded.In 1971, the chief engineers of Pye Records Ltd. decided to do a controlledexperiment with Raudive. They invited him to their sound lab and installedspecial equipment to block out any radio and television signals. They would notallow Raudive to touch any of the equipment.Raudive used one tape recorder that was monitored by a control tape recorder.All he could do was speak into a microphone. They taped Raudive's voice foreighteen minutes and none of the experimenters heard any other sounds. But whenthe scientists played back the tape, to their amazement, they heard over twohundred voices recorded on tape.In the same year, Colin Smythe, Ltd. England published expanded Englishtranslations of Raudive's book: Breakthrough, an Amazing Experiment inElectronic Communication with the Dead. Dr. Konstantin Raudive was a Latvianpsychologist who had read Juergenson's book, Radio Contact with the Dead, with agreat deal of skepticism when it was translated into German in 1967.Nevertheless, he was intrigued and over several years carried out hundreds ofexperiments under laboratory conditions.In the years that followed, Juergenson and Raudive continued their research thatinspired countless others to emulate their experiments. But constant criticismthat the EVP was nothing more than ambient sounds processed by the mind into asemblance of speech, or snatches of shortwave radio, dampened enthusiasm forresearch in Europe.However, during the 1970s and early 80s in the United States, EVP continued toevolve with much of the work spearheaded by a retired engineer, George Meek. In1971, Meek opened a small laboratory Philadelphia after a lifetime's interest inthe paranormal. Meek soon became immersed in EVP—and realized its limitations.Meek was convinced that for electronic communication with the dead to make itsmark, apparatus more sophisticated than cassette recorders and AM radios wouldbe necessary.Meek decided that the best way to succeed was to attempt contact with someonewho had passed on and work with him and his team in achieving two-waycommunication with the Other Side. The problem of course was gaining the initialcontact.Meek wrote to the now defunct American magazine The Psychic Observer, which puthim in touch with Bill O'Neil, an electronics engineer who was also a giftedclairvoyant. Through O’Neil, Meek’s team, later to form themselves into theMetascience Foundation, made contact with a man who claimed to have been deadfor five years and who was a medical doctor while on earth.“Doc Nick,” as the discarnate became known, suggested to O'Neil that the teamuse certain audio frequencies instead of the white noise traditionally used byEVP researchers. This, he said, would serve as an energy source against whichthe sounds produced by his vocal cords could be played. The resultingexperiments worked better than anyone had ever expected.Soon after, a spirit being calling himself Dr. George Jeffries Mueller, wasrecruited to the team, or rather he announced he had come to join them aftermaterializing one afternoon in O'Neil's living room. Mueller claimed to be adeceased university professor and NASA scientist.Mueller told Meek and O’Neil that he had died in 1967 and gave them numerousfacts with which to verify his identity including his security number; the placewhere his death certificate could be found; and intimate details of his life andscholastic achievements. All of them checked out.He began communicating regularly; helping to design a new piece ofelectromagnetic equipment that would convert spirit voices to audible voices. OnOctober 27, 1977, his first words were recorded on the new system Meek calledSpiricom.Tapes of the Mueller conversations were subsequently released to the public. Thevoice of Mueller can be plainly heard joking with Meek and O'Neil and discussingtopics from his favorite foods to the view of time from the spirit world.He gave unlisted telephone numbers asking them to make calls to confirm theidentity (which they did successfully) of the people at the other end (usuallytop-level government personnel); and he gives O'Neil precise directions withwhich to help build experimental video equipment to take spirit communication tothe next level. The clarity of the communications is astounding, and sometimesamusing. In one conversation, Mueller identifies a problem with a particulardevice and impatiently barks at O'Neil: “The fault lies in an impedance mismatchwhich can be corrected by using a 150 ohm half-watt resistor in parallel with a0.0047 microfad ceramic capacitor.”Eventually, Mueller ceased contact after telling Meek and O'Neil that naturallaw meant he could “not be here forever.” (He did in fact return once more to agroup of ITC researchers working in Rivenick, Germany, led by Adolph Homes. In1991 they received on a TV screen an image that was said to be that of DrMueller).Meek concluded that Mueller had progressed to a higher state of being to such apoint that Spiricom could no longer be used for communication. Apparently, onlybeings closest to the Earth plane of existence, could communicate through therelatively primitive electronics.It had become clear that the most limiting aspect of the device was the factthat it depended almost entirely on the operator possessing mediumistic orpsychic abilities. Obviously, gifted individuals like Bill O'Neil, Dr.Konstantin Raudive and Nikola Tesla were a necessary component in the receptionof signals and voices from the Aether.Just as batteries energize a portable CD player, the vibrant field of energythat surrounds special people activates electronic equipment tuned to receiveother realities. Without these people, it is doubtful that enough energy can beprovided by the discarnate entity to achieve communication.George Meek fully accepted this and never patented Spiricom. His hope was thatscience would carry on his work and take it to the next level, going beyond whathe and O'Neil were able and unable to accomplish.In 1982, Meek held a press conference in Washington, DC and revealed Spiricom'ssecrets. The conference made little impact on a largely skeptical world; in facta large section of the media even refused to attend, so the device went largelyunreported—except by the tabloids that naturally poked fun at the sensationalstory. Since that time, the focus of attention in terms of results has switchedto Europe.Nine months after Meek went public, on January 15, 1982, an electronics engineernamed Hans-Otto Koenig, helped the now defunct Radio Luxembourg do a livebroadcast on what was claimed to be a two-way conversation with a dead person.Koenig had invented an ultrasound device after closely following Meek’s workthat, he claimed, could replicate the Spiricom and Mueller/O'Neil dialogues. Theequipment was carefully set up under the watchful eye of the Radio Luxembourgengineers.The device, nicknamed Koenig's Generator by Rainer Holbe, the programs host, wasconnected to a set of speakers and switched on. An engineer asked over the airif any spirits cared to speak. Within seconds, a clear voice was heard. It saidquite simply: “Otto Koenig makes wireless with the dead.” Understandablypandemonium broke out in the studio.Another question was asked and seconds later a voice replied: “We hear yourvoice.” Rainer Holbe affirmed live on air there had been no trickery and laterthe station issued a statement stating that its engineers had found no naturalexplanation for what had happened.Soon after, the device was demonstrated to members of the German EVP Associationin Frankfurt where Konstantin Raudive, who had died in 1974, confirmed hispresence. On the strength of this, one of Koenig’s associates Dr ErnstSenkowski, a physics lecturer, electronics expert and veteran EVP researcher,persuaded George Meek to fly to Germany.After a demonstration of the Koenig's Generator, Meek flew back convinced it wasgenuine and set about raising money to fund future work. Others in the field ofelectronics and radio who also have an interest in contacts with spirits havecarried on with further research.Experiments held at a mansion in Newport Rhode Island have yielded someinteresting results involving paranormal activity and the use of shortwave radioas a possible means of communication with other realities.A research team led by Steve Cerilli has determined that tube based short-waveradios can provide a communication link with other planes of existence and theirinhabitants. Recordings made on October 3, 1999 demonstrate that spirit entitiescan manipulate shortwave radios.Curiously, the spirits present on that night learned how to better interact withthe shortwave as the session progressed. By the end of the experiment, theentire room was awash with a form of static/electromagnetic energy. The tapes ofthis experiment are still undeveloped at this time.Development of a paranormal recording involves re-dubbing the tape i.e. makingmultiple generations for reasons unknown. Research was expected to be completedby the end of the decade; however, as of yet, nothing has been released.The owner of the location, which is known for its paranormal activity, read aseries of questions scripted by the research team. The spirits were addressedand asked to participate in the experiment. The method of recording andequipment being used was then described. The questions asked were Socratic innature, which means that they lead the listener to a revelation, each questionbuilding upon the former.As a result of these experiments, all paranormal activity in the castle hasstopped. It was the intention of the researchers to help these entities byachieving contact. The researchers felt that the spirits were somehow trapped orlost in between dimensions.One possible scenario for disturbed spirit presences and hauntings is that dueto a tragic event in an individuals lifetime, the desire to remain on this planeof time creates a state of suspension. Spirits in this suspended state becomeprisoners of their own inability to let go.It is believe that by establishing a communication link with the shortwave andasking relevant questions (Socratic Method), lost spirits can be freed fromtheir suspended state and made aware that there is nothing outside their ownconsciousness holding them back. One of the participants, Jennipher Roos,described her experience that night. “After spending the time it took to set upthe equipment in the ballroom, about an hour, I walked outside to clear mythoughts and energy centers.“Upon returning to the room, I could immediately feel changing vibrations withmyself. I walked around the perimeter of the room in attempt to familiarizemyself with my surroundings. I noticed a particularly strong feeling, highlysensational, in the corner of the room leading into the master bedroom.“The only color of light I noticed before the experiments began was a slightbrightness in that corner of no particular color. The light surrounding thepeople participating in the study was nothing worth noting nothing out of theordinary.“During the first session, recording only, I was not aware of any overwhelmingpresence or energy disturbances. I was sitting on the floor—to the left of theMayan sculpture. I felt centered and secure at all times; and although the roomwas highly charged, I cannot report any great shifts in the overall energy ofthe space and no specific concentrations of electromagnetism. The only notablechange I observed was that the light in the corner of the room by the masterbedroom had increased in intensity and now had a slightly bluish tinge.“The next session, which involved the short wave radio, was quite an experiencefor me personally.I had moved to the corner of the room that I previously described as highlyactive. “Once I was centered on the floor and the questions began I couldimmediately sense a presence ofsome kind. A slight vibration moved from the floor, through my bottom andthighs, up my spine andinto my head. This sensation was exceptionally strong and caused all of my hairsto stand on end. “I placed my hands palm down on the floor in front of me andreceived the same sensation throughmy hands and arms, which heightened incredibly the overall effect. I could seeluminous light allaround me and when I moved my hand in front of me, the light attached itself tome and left a streak oflight, like a tracer, in its path of movement.“The short-wave radio was definitely receiving some sort of transmission amongstthe white noise,but it was very faint deviations to me. However, about half-way through thissession I began to hearother noises in the room.“The best way I can describe them is like a low tone of church bells played veryslowly...almost likea drone, but in a pattern that was repeatedly louder at the beginning of each“chime.” This sound wasmoving throughout the room in a circular fashion, like in stereo surround.“As I focused all of my concentration and energy on the light and this sound,the short wave seemedto become more effected and I could definitely feel an increase ofelectromagnetic energy as thesession progressed. At one point I was fairly overwhelmed with the feeling of itall...my body hair wason end for the entire session.“I never observed any other colors at this time, nor did I feel that any of theparticipants, includingmyself were in any sort of danger. This part of the experiment was definitelythe most powerful forme.“I moved to the floor between the two aforementioned chairs and it was at thistime that I started tonotice huge changes in the short wave's regularity as the speaker asked directquestions to specific pieces. The shortwave’s inflections were very quick aftereach question was asked, which indicatesthat perhaps the life forms are a bit more responsive when singled outindividually. “When the speaker addressed the Mayan statue, I observed itradiating a light that is best describedas a dull-reddish magenta color. The light fully surrounded the Mayan andstreamed off a bit in thedirection of the microphone, but did not get close to it. This light remaineduntil the session was over.”INSTRUMENTAL TRANSCOMMUNICATION (ITC)In 1985 Swiss electronics expert, Klaus Schreiber who, as a result of studyingGeorge Meek’s Spiricom designs, invented an apparatus he called “Vidicom.” TheVidicom consisted of a specially adapted TV, switched on but not attached to anaerial, with a video camera in front of it to capture images that appeared onthe screen. One of the first pictures he received was a blurred, fleeting imageof a human figure.Occasionally just voices would come across, telling him how to tune his TV forbetter reception. A typical session would begin with a TV screen full of dots.Then small ovals would appear one after another, each growing quickly until theydisappeared off the screen. Within minutes faces would start to appear alongwith voices, to the astonishment of Schreiber himself and his visitors.It wasn't long after Shreiber death in 1988 that his image started appearing onthe TV screens of Europe's ITC researchers. Schreiber's friend Martin Wenzelcontinued his work with some success, but as with Spiricom the Schreiber method,to work effectively, needed to be used by someone with the sensitivity of apsychic and strong mediumistic links with other planes of existence.In April 1990 George Meek’s wife Jeanette died after a long illness. Before shecrossed over, however, Meek had asked her to get firmly in mind the namesTimeStream (a spiritside sending station linked to a young, leading-edgeresearch laboratory in Luxembourg) and Swejen Salter (the system's operator andresearch director on the spirit side), Hopefully these memories would act as ahoming device once she crossed over, pulling Jeannette to the research station.It apparently worked; three months after Jeannette's funeral she reportedly hadlocated the TimeStream station and sent the following letter to George via theLuxembourg computer: “DEAR G.W. B WELL, IT SEEMS THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO DONOT BELIEVE IN THE CONTACTS YOUR FRIENDS HERE IN LUXEMBOURG ARE HAVING. HENCE IWILL GIVE YOU SOME PERSONAL DETAILS KNOWN ONLY TO YOU AND MOLLY. “FIRST STORY.IN 1987, END OF APRIL, OUR TENANT DEBBIE CALLED TO SAY HER REFRIGERATOR WAS OFF.IT MUST HAVE BEEN ON A THURSDAY MORNING...“SECOND STORY. ON APRIL 29, 1987, ANN VALENTIN WROTE A LETTER FORM CALIFORNIASAYING SHE HAD NOT RECEIVED THE MAGIC OF LIVING FOREVER BOOKLETS SHE HADORDERED, BUT INSTEAD HAD RECEIVED A BOX OF HARLEQUIN NOVELS.“THIRD STORY. JOHN LATHROP SHUTOFF THE ELECTRICITY AT OUR RENTAL HOUSE TO PUT INTHE NEW YARD LIGHT, HE WASN'T DOWN THERE VERY LONG BUT CHARGED $20 SERVICE INADDITION TO $40 FOR THE BULBS, PLUS TAX. THE CHARGE SEEMED HIGH.“DON'T TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS, HONEY, MY NEVER-ENDING LOVE TO YOU. I MISS YOU SOMUCH, BUT I KNOW WE WILL BE TOGETHER. LOVE FOREVER, JEANNETTE DUNCAN MEEK.”To support the validity of the ITC contact, Jeannette had selected three veryprivate items known only to the Meeks and their secretary Molly Philo. Thesecond item about romance novels, in fact, was a complete puzzle, even toGeorge.Upon receiving Jeannette's letter from the Luxembourg team and getting hisexcitement under control, Meek called Ann Valentinin California to verify itemtwo. Sure enough, a carton of novels had arrived mysteriously in 1987, and tothis day no one knows who sent them.The most exciting and potentially fruitful development is that of communicationvia computer. Ken Webster of England published a book in which he reported onmore than 200 computer contacts with local persons who had died more than threecenturies ago.One of Webster's main contacts was 16th century Englishman Thomas Harden, whohad lived in the same house that Webster now resided in, when the town was stillnamed Bristol. From the astral planes, Harden could see Webster's electronicequipment in the living room.He referred to the computer as a box with a multitude of lights sitting near mychimney. Harden would communicate in old English grammar in a variety of ways Btelepathic messages, scribbles on notepaper, chalk-written messages on the floorand, most important, computer files written on the display screen and generatedon hard disk.Harden later was reported to have explained to his earth-side colleague Websterthat the writing was formed according to his will or his visualization in the“Lightbox.” Another interesting feature was that Harden said that he wasn’t adiscarnate entity, communicating from the beyond. Instead, he claimed to bespeaking from his own time in the 17th century. So rather then talking with thedead, this seemed to be a case of time travel.During the 1980's psychic researchers became aware of claims that various peoplehad received telephone calls from loved ones after they had died. The calls wereusually only of short duration and when investigated did not register on normaltelephone monitoring equipment. D. Scott Rogo extensively covered this subjectin his book Telephone Calls From The Dead. (1979).A husband and wife couple working in Luxembourg between 1985 and 1988, alongwith helpers from the afterlife, developed two electronic systems which becamesignificantly more reliable and repeatable than the systems developed earlier.Jules and Maggie Harsch-Fishbach in 1987 established computer contact thatallows submission of technical questions with high-speed print-out of thecarefully considered replies. Also in 1987, they received TV picture sequencesof good quality (Psychic News February 25th 1995). By 1993, the research team inthe afterlife was able to access the hard drives of computers and leavedetailed, computer-scanned images as well as several pages of text. Thecomputer-scanned images were far more detailed and less subject to distortionthan the video images. Researchers on earth were able to direct questions totheir counterparts on the other side and receive answers by telephone, radio,TV, computer, or fax (Kubris and Macy 1995: 14).Dominic R Macquarie stated in the November 15, 1997 issue of Psychic News thatcommunication between the earth plane and the afterlife is more successful whenthere is a mediumistic person, who has more than average ectoplasm present.Konstantine, Raudive, German Professor E Senkowski and George Meek had earlierconfirmed this.The need to have some form of electromagnetic energy present has always beenrecognized as an essential component of EVP. Macquarie claims that experimenterssince 1963 have obtained better results if they turn on three twelve- volttransformers (the kind which change household voltage to lower voltage forportable radios, CD players etc.) within 3 to 4 inches (8-12cms) of each other.They produce a very quiet hum that provides a weak gentle field ofelectromagnetic energy that can be used by discarnate entities.“One has always to keep in mind that whilst ectoplasm and electromagnetic energymust be present when communicating with the afterlife, an experimenter who isnegative and uses the presumption of futility will be exuding negative energyand will dramatically reduce successful communication,” says Macquarie. “This‘experimenter effect’ has been found in mediumship, laboratory testing and whenusing electronic equipment.“So even though communication can occur through television, radio equipment andthe telephone, the clarity of transmission depends on the contact field, thethoughts of those receiving the transmission. It has been discovered at largeopen meetings, that if a group of people had negative thoughts about ITC, theirnegative vibrations seriously affected the vibrations coming from the astralplane.”Even though Nikola Tesla in his early years had little patience with those whobelieved in spirits and unknown psychic abilities, he may have had a change ofheart later in his life and after leaving the physical plane. In 1998, a mediumby the name of Alice Cromley alleged that she had made contact with the spiritof Tesla through electronic methods similar to what Tesla used.In a series of communications, all conducted at a secure home in Montreal,Canada, Mrs. Cromley received information concerning Tesla’s continued existenceafter his death and the new discoveries that awaited him on the other side.Tesla was apparently eager to tell those interested in his life and science, notto dismiss ideas that appear supernatural or not of science.“Physics extends beyond what is scientifically known today,” Tesla communicated.“The future will show that what we now call occult or the supernatural is basedon a science not yet developed, but whose first infant steps are being taken aswe speak!”[Image00005.gif]CHAPTER SIX DID TESLA DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF ANTIGRAVITY?Nikola Tesla has been credited for the creation of much of the technology thatwe take for granted today. Without the genius of Tesla we would not have radio,television, AC electricity, Tesla coil, fluorescent lighting, neon lighting,radio control devices, robotics, X-rays, radar, microwaves and dozens of otheramazing inventions.Because of this, it is no surprise that Tesla also delved into the world offlight and possibly, antigravity. In fact, his last patent in 1928 (# 6,555,114)was for a flying machine that resembled both a helicopter and an airplane.Before he died, Tesla reportedly devised plans for the engine of a spaceship. Hecalled it the anti-electromagnetic field drive or Space Drive.William R. Lyne writes in Occult Ether Physics (Creatopia Productions), that alecture Tesla prepared for the Institute of Immigrant Welfare (May. 12, 1938),dealt with his Dynamic Theory of Gravity. Tesla said in his lecture that thiswas: “One of two far reaching discoveries, which I worked out in all details inthe year’s 1893 and1894.”While researching Tesla’s statements, Lyne discovered that more completestatements concerning these discoveries could only be gleaned from scattered andsparse sources, because Tesla’s papers are concealed in government vaults fornational security reasons.When Lyne specifically asked for these papers at the National Security ResearchCenter (now the Robert J. Oppenheimer Research Center) in 1979, he was deniedaccess because they were still classified. In his 1938 lecture, Tesla said hewas progressing with the work, and hoped to give the theory to the world verysoon. The two great discoveries, to which Tesla referred, were:1. The Dynamic Theory of Gravity—which assumed a field of force which accountsfor the motions of bodies in space; assumption of this field of force dispenseswith the concept of space curvature (ala Einstein); the ether has anindispensable function in the phenomena (of universal gravity, inertia,momentum, and movement of heavenly bodies, as well as all atomic and molecularmatter).2. Environmental Energy - the Discovery of a new physical Truth: there is noenergy in matter other than that received from the environment. (Which goesagainst Einstein’s E’mc2). The usual Tesla birthday announcement - on his 79thbirthday (1935)—Tesla made a brief reference to the theory saying it applies tomolecules and atoms as well as to the largest heavenly bodies, and to “...allmatter in the universe in any phase of its existence from its very formation toits ultimate disintegration.”In an article, Man's Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory ofGravity by saying that the luminiferous ether fills all space. The ether isacted upon by the life-giving creative force and is thrown into “infinitesimalwhirls” (“micro helices”) at near the speed of light, becoming ponderablematter. When the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether(a form of “atomic decay”).Man can harness these processes to precipitate matter from the ether. Createwhatever he wants with the matter and energy derived. Alter the earth's size.Control earth's seasons (weather control). Guide earth's path through theUniverse, like a spaceship. Cause the collisions of planets to produce new sunsand stars, heat, and light. Originate and develop life in infinite forms.When Tesla was 82, instead of speaking at a dinner party, he issued a writtenstatement. Although this was soon after a car had struck him, his mind wasobviously still capable of mounting an attack on Einstein's theory ofrelativity:“I have worked out a dynamic theory of gravity in all details and hope to givethis to the world very soon. It explains the causes of this force and themotions of heavenly bodies under its influence so satisfactorily that it willput an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space.According to the relativists, space has a tendency to curvature owing to aninherent property or presence of celestial bodies.“Granting a semblance of reality to this fantastic idea, it is still veryself-contradictory. Every action is accompanied by an equivalent reaction andthe effects of the latter are directly opposite to those of the former.Supposing that the bodies act upon the surrounding space causing curvature ofthe same, it appears to my simple mind that the curved spaces must react on thebodies and, producing the opposite effects, straighten out the curves.“Since action and reaction are coexistent, it follows that the supposedcurvature of space is entirely impossible. However, even if it existed it wouldnot explain the motions of the bodies as observed. Only the existence of a fieldof force can account for them and its assumption dispenses with space curvature.All literature on this subject is futile and destined to oblivion.”It is a great pity that Tesla never published his dynamic theory of gravity.Modern thinking about gravity suggests that when a heavy object moves it emitsgravitational waves that radiate at the speed of light. These gravity wavesbehave in similar ways to many other types of waves.Tesla's greatest inventions were all based on the study of waves. He alwaysconsidered sound, light, heat, X-rays and radio waves to be related phenomenathat could be studied using the same sort of math. His differences with Einsteinsuggest that he had extended this thinking to cosmology and the mysteries ofgravity.In the 1980s, a study of energy loss in a double neutron star pulsar called PSR1913 + 16 proved that gravity waves do exist. Tesla's idea that gravity is afield effect is now taken more seriously than Einstein took it. Unfortunately,Tesla never revealed what had led him to this conclusion. He never explained histheory of gravitation to the world. The attack he made on Einstein's work wasconsidered outrageous by the scientific establishment of the time, and only nowdo we have enough understanding of gravity to realize that he was right.HOW TO BUILD A FLYING SAUCERTesla had discovered that the electrostatic emission from the surface of aconductor would always concentrate where the surface curves or even presents anedge; the sharper the curve or edge, the greater the concentration of electronemission. Tesla also observed that an electrostatic charge would flow over thesurface of a conductor rather than penetrate it. This is called the Faraday orSkin Effect, discovered by Michael Faraday many years ago.This also explains the principles of the Faraday Cage that is used in highvoltage research labs to protect humans and electrosensitive equipment fromharm. According to eyewitness reports of interiors of UFOs, there is a circularcolumn or channel through the center of the vehicle.This reportedly serves as a superstructure for the rest of the saucer shapedvehicle, and also carries a high voltage, high frequency coil. It is believed tobe a resonant transformer which gives the electrostatic and electromagneticcharge to the craft and establishes polarity.This coil is relative to what is known as a Tesla coil. Tesla invented the TeslaCoil, in 1891. This column or channel is approximately two feet in diameter andis hollow. On some vehicles this hollow area has a turbine generator in it.When the vacuum is created on one hemisphere of the craft, the atmosphericpressure is allowed to rush through the tube to drive a sort of turbineelectrical generator. Some unverified reports say the extraterrestrials use thissystem as stationary power plants for the generation of electrical energy ontheir home planets as well.The eyes of the craft are arranged by electro-optic lenses placed at quadrantsor wherever they wish to see from. The screen-like monitors are placed on aconsole where the navigator can observe all areas around and about the vehicleat the same time. This includes the magnification lenses that are used withoutchanging positions.There are also windows about elbow level and about one foot through or thick.This distance would have to be in view of the four or more walls or plates ofthe capacitor hulls making up the major portion of the craft. The windows havean iris type of shutter so that when it is closed, it allows electrostaticcharge to flow evenly.DR T. TOWNSEND BROWN AND ELECTROGRAVITICSThe idea of using high voltage electricity as a means of propulsion is not new.Tesla laid the groundwork in the late 19th century which was then continued bysuch notables as Thomas Townsend Brown, who discovered in 1923 what was latercalled the Biefeld -Brown Effect. Thomas Townsend Brown was a physics student ofDr. Paul Alfred Biefeld at the California Institute for Advanced Studies. Brownnoticed that when he had two plates carrying high voltages of direct currentseparated by a dielectric, the negative electrode moved by itself in thedirection of the positive plate. In other words, Townsend Brown discovered thatit is possible to create an artificial gravity field by charging an electricalcapacitor to a high-voltage.He built a special capacitor which utilized a heavy, high charge-accumulating(high K-factor) dielectric material between its plates and found that whencharges with between 70,000 to 300,000 volts, it would move in the direction ofits positive pole. When oriented with its positive side up, it would proceed tolose about one percent of its weight.He attributed this motion to electrostatically-induced gravity fields actingbetween the capacitor's oppositely charged plates. By 1958, he had succeeded indeveloping a 15-inch diameter model saucer that could lift over 110% of itsweight. Brown's experiments had launched a new field of investigation that cameto be known as Electrogravitics, the technology of controlling gravity throughthe use of high-voltage electric charge.As early as 1952, an Air Force major general witnessed a demonstration in whichBrown flew a pair of 18-inch disc airfoils suspended from opposite ends of arotating arm. When electrified with 50,000 volts, they circuited at a speed of12 miles per hour.About a year later, he flew a set of three-foot diameter saucers for some AirForce officials and representatives from a number of major aircraft companies.When energized with 150,000 volts, the discs sped around the 50-foot diametercourse so fast that the subject was immediately classified.Interavia magazine later reported that the discs could attain speeds of severalhundred miles per hour when charged with several hundred thousand volts. Brown'sdiscs were charged with a high positive voltage, on a wire, running along theirleading edge and a high negative voltage, on a wire, running along theirtrailing edge.As the wires ionized the air around them, a dense cloud of positive ions wouldform ahead of the craft and corresponding cloud of negative ions would formbehind the craft. Brown's research indicated that, like the charged plates ofhis capacitors, these ion clouds induced a gravitational force directed in theminus to plus direction.As the disc moved forward in the response to its self-generated gravity field,it would carry with it its positive and negative ion clouds and their associatedelectrogravity gradient. Consequently, the discs would ride their advancinggravity wave much as surfers ride an ocean wave.Dr. Mason Rose, one of Townsend's colleagues, described the discs principle ofoperation as follows: “The saucers made by Brown have no propellers, no jets, nomoving parts at all. They create a modification of the gravitational fieldaround themselves, which is analogous to putting them on the incline of a hill.The electrogravitational saucer creates its own hill, which is a localdistortion of the gravitational field, and then it takes this hill with it inany chosen direction and at any rate.[Image00006.gif]“The occupants of one of [Brown's] saucers would feel no stress at all no matterhow sharp the turn or how great the acceleration. This is because the ship andits occupants and the load are all responding equally to the wave-likedistortion of the local gravitation field.”Although skeptics at first thought that more mundane effects such as thepressure of negative ions striking the positive electrode propelled the discs;Brown later carried out vacuum chamber tests that proved that a force waspresent even in the absence of such ion thrust.He did not offer a theory to explain this unconventional electrograviticphenomenon; except to say that it was predicted neither by general relativitynor by modern theories of electromagnetism. However, recent advances intheoretical physics provide a rather straightforward explanation of theprinciple.According to the novel physics of subquantum kinetics, gravity potential canadopt two polarities, instead of one. Not only can a gravity field exist in theform of a matter-attracting gravity potential well, as standard physics teaches,but it can also exist in the form of a matter repelling gravity potential hill.Moreover, it predicts that these gravity polarities should be directly matchedwith electrical polarity; positively charged particles such as protonsgenerating gravity wells and negatively charged particles such as electronsgenerating gravity hills.Thus contrary to conventional theory, the electron produces a matter-repellinggravity field. Electrical neutral matter remains gravitationally attractivebecause of the proton's G-well marginally dominates the electron's G-hill.Consequently, subquantum kinetics predicts that the negative ion cloud behindBrown's disc should form a matter repelling gravity hill while the positive ioncloud ahead of the disc should form a matter attracting gravity well.As increasing voltage is applied to the disc, the gravity potential hill andwell become increasing prominent and the gravity potential gradient between themincreasing steep. In Rose's terminology, the craft would find itself on theincline of a gravitational hill. Since gravity force is known to increase inaccordance with the steepness of such a gravity potential slope, increasedvoltage would induce an increasingly strong gravity force on the disc and wouldact in the direction of the positive ion cloud. The disc would behave as if itwas being tugged by a very strong gravitational field emanating from aninvisible planet sized mass positioned beyond its positive pole.Early in 1952, Brown had put together a proposal, code named ProjectWinterhaven, which suggested that the military developed an antigravity combatsaucer with Mach-3 capability. The 1956 intelligence study entitledElectrogravitics Systems: An Explanation of Electrostatic Motion, DynamicCounterbary and Barycentric Control, prepared by the private aviationintelligence firm, Aviation Studies International Ltd.,indicates that as earlyas November 1954 the Air Force had begun plans to fund research that wouldaccomplish Project Winterhaven's objectives.The study, originally classified Confidential, mentions the name of more thanten major aircraft companies which were actively involved in theelectrogravitics research in an attempt to duplicate or extend Brown's seminalwork. Additional information is to be found in another aviation intelligencereport entitled: The Gravitics Situation. Unfortunately, due to the militariesTOP SECRET classification, Townsend Brown’s work has not appeared in any physicsor science publications that can be accessed.ARTICLE REVEALS GOVERNMENT RESEARCHBecause of the influence of such pioneers as Tesla and T. Townsend Brown, theresearch and development of antigravity devices has been ongoing for a number ofyears. The June 1957 issue of Mechanic’s Illustrated featured an article by G.Harry Stine entitled: Conquest of Space. Stine, the Chief of Navy RangeOperations at White Sands Proving Grounds, makes it perfectly clear that themilitary was extremely interested in antigravity research.There is a good chance that the rocket will be obsolete for space travel within50 years. Some of us have been concentrating on the development of the rocket asthe possible power plant for outer space propulsion. We’ve fired a lot ofrockets and we've proved that they will work well in outer space. We’ve alsolearned a lot about what's out there by using rockets. And probably we will takethe first few faltering steps into space with rocket power plants.But recent discoveries indicate that the spaceship of the future may be poweredby anti-gravity devices. These, instead of using brute force to overcomegravity, will use the force of gravity itself much as an airplane uses the airto make it fly.Sir William Crookes, the English scientist who developed the cathode-ray tube wenow use for television, made extensive investigations of levitation phenomena -a field that once belonged to vaudeville magicians. Scientists, reasoning thatif they believed his reports of weird green glows in vacuum tubes they shouldalso look into Crookes' levitation studies, have been making slow but steadyprogress.Others have been investigating the fields of gravitic isotopes, jet electronstreams, and the mechanics of the electron shells of atoms. Townsend T. Brown,an American investigator, has gone even further than that. There are rumors thatBrown has developed a real antigravity machine. There are many firms working onthe problems of antigravity - the Glenn L. Martin Co., Bell Aircraft, GeneralElectric, Sperry-Rand Corp. and others.Rumors have been circulating that scientists have built disc airfoils two feetin diameter incorporating a variation of the simple two-plate electricalcondenser (capacitor), which charged to a potential of 50,000 volts, hasachieved a speed of seventeen feet per second with a total energy input of fiftywatts. A three-foot diameter disc airfoil charged to 150 Kilovolts turned outsuch an amazing performance that the whole thing was immediately classified.Flame-jet generators, making use of the electrostatic charge discovered inrocket exhausts, have been developed which will supply charges up to 15 millionvolts.Several important things have been discovered with regard to gravity propulsion.For one, the propulsive force doesn’t act on only one part of the ship it ispushing; it acts on all parts within the gravity field created by the graviticdrive. It probably is not limited to the speed of light.Gravity-powered vehicles have apparently changed direction, accelerated rapidlyat very high g’s and stopped abruptly without any heavy stresses beingexperienced by the measuring devices aboard the vehicle and within thegravity-propulsion field. This control is done by changing the direction,intensity and polarity of the charge on the condenser plates of the drive unit,a fairly simple task for scientists.Sounds incredible, doesn’t it? But the information comes from reliable sources.We are licking the problems of gravity. Indications are that we are on the vergeof tapping a brand new group of electrical waves which link electricity andgravity. Electronic engineers have taken the electrical coil and used it as alink between electricity and electro-magnetism, thus giving us a science ofelectromagnetic’s which in turn has given us such things as radio, television,radar and the like.Now, gravity researchers seem to think that the condenser will open up thescience of electrogravitics. Soon we may be able to eliminate gravity as astructural, dynamic and medical problem.Although we will probably use rocket power to make our first explorations intospace, the chances are now pretty good that this will not always be the case. In50 years we may travel to the moon, the planets or even the stars propelled bythe harnessed forces of gravity.If this seems fantastic, remember that the rocket and the idea of a trip to themoon was fantastic twenty years ago. Fifty years ago the idea of commercial airtravel was utter nonsense.With gravitic spaceships, we may travel to the moon in less than an hour, to theplanets in less than a day or to the stars themselves in a matter of months. Wemay be able to do it in absolute comfort without the problems of zero-gravity orhigh accelerations.The idea of the rocket becoming obsolete is not a happy idea, particularly whenso much work has been done on rockets. If a better method comes along, why shedtears? After all, our basic goal is to travel and explore in space and itdoesn’t make much difference how we do it.IS ANTIGRAVITY ALREADY IN USE?Recently an article appeared in Jane's Aviation Weekly that stated the B-2Stealth Nuclear-Strike Bomber is in fact, currently using an electrograviticpropulsion system. Paul A. LaViolette has done considerable study on the use ofelectrogravitic technology by the U.S. Air Force, which has conducted secretBlack Project research on the matter since late 1954.LaViolette contends that electrogravitics may have been put to practical use inthe B-2 Advanced Technology Bomber to provide an exotic auxiliary mode ofpropulsion. This conclusion is based on the recent disclosure that the B-2charges both its wing leading edge and jet exhaust stream to a high voltage.Positive ions emitted from its wing leading edge would produce a positivelycharged parabolic ion sheath ahead of the craft while negative ions injectedinto its exhaust stream would set up a trailing negative space charge with apotential difference in excess of 15 million volts.According to electrogravitic research carried out by Tesla and T. TownsendBrown, such a differential space charge would set up an artificial gravity fieldthat would induce a reactionless force on the aircraft in the direction of thepositive pole.An electrogravitic drive of this sort could allow the B-2 to function withover-unity propulsion efficiency when cruising at supersonic velocities. OnMarch 9, 1992, Aviation Week And Space Technology magazine made a surprisingdisclosure that the B-2 electrostatically charges its exhaust stream and theleading edges of its wing-like body.Those familiar with the research of Tesla in the early 20th Century will quicklyrealize that this is tantamount to stating that the B-2 is able to function asan antigravity aircraft. Aviation Week obtained their information about the B-2from a small group of renegade west coast scientists and engineers who wereformerly associated with black research projects.In making these disclosures, these scientists broke a code of silence thatrivals the Mafia's. They took the risk because they felt that it was importantfor economic reasons that efforts be made to declassify certain blacktechnologies for commercial use.Two of these individuals said that their civil rights had been blatantly abused(in the name of security) either to keep them quiet, or to prevent them fromleaving the tightly controlled black research and development community.Although the scientists mentioned nothing about electrogravitics in theirAviation Week disclosure about the B-2, they did admit to the existence of verydramatic, classified technologies applicable to aircraft control and propulsion.They were especially hesitant to discuss these projects, noting that they arevery secret. One of them commented: “Besides, it would take about 20 hours toexplain the principles, and very few people would understand them anyway.”Apparently, what he meant is that this aircraft control and propulsiontechnology is based on principles that go beyond what is currently known andunderstood by most academic physicists. That is with the exception of twogeniuses that developed the original ideas for high voltage electric drivesdecades ago. It must be also considered that the B-2 is now no longer the onlyaircraft to use such technologies. Since that time, an entire generation ofblack budget secret aircraft may have been developed with electrograviticsystems.ART BELLS MYSTERIOUS METAL —THE KEY TO ANTIGRAVITYThe suggestion that UFOs could be manmade flying machines using exotictechnologies is not new to the study of unidentified flying objects. In the1950's several researchers in Europe claimed that Tesla and Marconi had secretlybuilt and tested operational antigravity aircraft. Using electrogravitic drives,these experimental aircraft were eventually based out of a secret location inSouth America.Allegedly, Nazi Germany got a hold of this technology and produced severalantigravity flying saucers of their own design. Fortunately, by the time Hitlerdecided to dedicate more time and funds to the Nazi flying saucer project, thewar was almost over for the Germans. Of course, by that time Tesla had passedaway, but it is almost certain that he would have been horrified by the use ofhis invention by the Germans.Early evidence for these anecdotal tales was scant and consisted almost entirelyof discovered research papers and a few photos of similarly shaped UFOs. As hasbeen already noted in this book, early UFO contactees such as George Adamski andHoward Menger witnessed and even photographed UFOs that bore a strikingresemblance to the small discs built by T. Townsend Brown.Could these UFOs actually be manmade machines flown by humans? Or wereextraterrestrials flying around in spacecraft utilizing similar technology asthat discovered by Tesla and Brown?In 1996, late night radio host Art Bell received a package containing bits ofmetal that the sender claimed was taken from the crashed UFO found near Roswell,New Mexico in 1947. Could these unassuming pieces of metal be the evidence thatproved the reality of UFOs and their use of electrogravitic technology? Thepieces of metal seemed almost too good to be true and Bell was at firstskeptical because of similar past hoaxes involving alleged parts from UFOs.Bell sent a few samples to Linda Moulton Howe, who promptly had the metalanalyzed. Using Wave Dispersive Spectroscopy, It was discovered that the metalwas made up of a magnesium zinc alloy with pure bismuth layers. There was arange from 97 to about 97 - 2 % magnesium and 3% to 2 2 % zinc in each of those100 to 200micron layers of the magnesium zinc, so the metal was almost entirelymagnesium with about 3% zinc.The pure bismuth layers were one to four microns thick in a slightly wavypattern and nothing else but bismuth was found. No oxygen was found, nozirconium, no other elements - just these three.High-energy experiments conducted on the unusual metal indicated a tendency forlateral movement. Unfortunately, this research has not resulted in any solidconclusions at this time. After this information was broadcast on Art’s show,Howe received a fax from a listener named Dan who indicated he had professionalknowledge that would relate the material to antigravity. He had worked from 1973to 1980 for an organization called Aeronautical Systems Division at Edwards AirForce Base in California with some assignments at Wright Patterson in Ohio.Dan received Bachelors degrees in physics, aerospace engineering and computerscience from California Polytechnic State University, master’s degrees incomputer science and aerospace engineering from the University of California atBerkley and then received his Ph.D. in physics in 1974 after he had alreadybegun work as a civilian scientist for the Air Force.Dan told Howe that he had been involved in aeronautical engineering andevaluations when he first saw metal similar to what was sent to Art bell. Themetal supposedly was used in electrogravitic capacities. In the case of bismuth,it’s basically a diamagnetic material; that means it tends to repel a magneticfield.“There were very strange things that were bound with bismuth as basicallypositive charges were added to it, you know, putting a field, a positiveelectron field into the bismuth,” Dan said to Howe. “As a matter of fact theywere very dramatic, some of the things that they found. A lot of this goes allthe way back to 1917 with Nikola Tesla and his discoveries of electrical fieldsand gravity.”Howe wanted to know as the positive flow was increased into bismuth, what wasthe most dramatic thing that would happen. Dan’s answer was that basically therewould be a mass reduction to the point where it could come to zero and actuallyrise into the air, creating a lifting body.A now defunct UFO group in England claimed that one of their members hadconducted experiments with dissimilar metals in the 1970's. He used two disks ofthe same dimension and thickness but of two different materials, copper andzinc. The disks were kept very close together and rotated in oppositedirections. The claim was they levitated when spun, though the comment did notspecify the requirement for high voltage as in the case of the Biefeld/Browneffect.It was simply rotation of mass that is more consistent with Otis T. Carr, BruceDePalma and Dr. Harold Aspden, with their claims of anomalous inertial orgravitic effects associated with rotating mass.At the recent Low Level Energy Conference, Michael Roberts, President of theAssociation for Push Gravity Research told an interesting story. One day a fewyears ago, he got a phone call at his home in Waco. It was from a fellow who hadstopped in Waco and wanted to meet Michael at a local mall.Michael drove out to the mall and the man was parked, in his late model Jeep ina remote section of the parking lot. They shook hands and talked a bit. The mansaid he would like to show Michael what he had been working on. The Jeep enginewas off; the vehicle was put in neutral and was not braked in anyway. Michaelwas asked to push the vehicle. He did so with both hands, meeting an expectedamount of resistance before he got it moving.The man got in and stopped the vehicle. He then showed Michael four mysteryboxes (each about 12\" X 6\" X 4\"), mounted in the top of each wheel well of theJeep. Each box had an electrical cable that led under the hood. Michael was notallowed to see under the hood. Immediately after the push test, the man got inthe Jeep and flicked a toggle switch that had been installed under thedashboard. Michael was then asked to push the Jeep again, this time it movedwith the light touch of one hand. The man would say nothing about how thismiracle was accomplished; he just wanted to show Michael that it was possible toachieve an antigravity effect using electricity.One possible explanation may be that the four boxes acted to provide astabilized buoyancy type field, like pontoons on a boat. The use of only onewould deflect the incoming gravity in one localized area, thus creating animbalance; whereas, one unit over each wheel would equally distribute thedeflection around the center of mass of the Jeep.The book Occult Ether Physics: Tesla's Hidden Space Propulsion System And TheConspiracy To Conceal It, concentrates on the 19th century Aether scienceleading up to Tesla's discovery of electro-propulsion. Tesla's Holy Grail was tobuild his electric flying machine, and to draw some of the environmental energyout of the cosmos.This plan involved a theory of radioactivity under development by Tesla in the1890s, which entirely presaged and conflicted with currently acceptedRelativism, quantum mechanics, and nuclear energy theories. To Tesla, so-calledatomic energy was in fact the result of environmental energy emanating from thecosmos, and made known to us via radioactive matter. This matter, Tesla said,had the peculiar property of resonating and reacting with ubiquitous cosmicradiation.The cosmic radiation of which Tesla spoke was of much higher frequency than whatwe call radioactive emanations. Tesla believed that these were the result of astep-down process, in which certain peculiar matter reacts to and convertsubiquitous, omnidirectional cosmic radiation.Today, we call this zero point radiation (ZPR), from higher frequencies, tolower, more useful and appropriate frequencies, such as gamma, x-ray,ultraviolet, visible, infrared radiation, as well as magnetism and evenelectrical current. These step-down frequencies are much easier to detect andmeasure than the ZPR.The existence of the ZPR was well known to Tesla in the 1890s, but it was notuntil recently that it became scientifically accepted as a proven fact. Thisradiation is of such high frequency that it normally passes through space, theearth, and our bodies without harm or incident, in constant equilibrium, becauseits short wavelengths do not normally react or resonate with the atoms of mostmatter.It is radioactive matter, according to Tesla, which has a peculiar atomicstructure that reacts with this radiation to produce radioactivity. Atomicenergy, to Tesla, comes from the ZPR, not atoms. If a lump of radium could beshielded from the effects of the ZPR, said Tesla, it would show noradioactivity.Most naturally radioactive elements are dense and unstable, that is, they aresaid by the Relativists to decay as radiation is emitted, to elements of loweratomic numbers. The Relativists, with whom Tesla vehemently disagreed, believethat naturally radioactive elements spontaneously lose mass in the process ofsuch decay, so that the energy released as radioactivity, is equivalent to thelost mass according to Einstein's equation, E=mc2.If non-radioactive elements are converted into radioactive elements by theforces of nature, what are these processes? In a New York Times article of July11, 1937 (pg.13, col.2), in one of Tesla's famous birthday announcements, Teslastated that he had developed a process for the manufacture of radium(transmutation from other elements), that was so efficient that it could be soldfor $l.00 per pound. He also announced that he had absolutely developed a systemfor the interstellar transmission of energy. He said he had been working inseveral laboratories, but refused to disclose their locations.His working model, he said, “...employs more than three-dozen of my inventions.It is a complex apparatus, an agglomeration of parts. It could convey severalthousand units of horsepower to other planets, regardless of the distance;traveling through a channel of less than one-half of one-millionth of acentimeter.” Further, he said, “This is not an experiment. I have built,demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it tothe world.”These facts demonstrate that even in his 80s, Tesla was involved in secretresearch at several undisclosed laboratories on technology that even todayremains highly classified; technology that is only now being fully understoodand secretly utilized.THE TESLA FLYING SAUCERBill Jones, writing for The UFO Enigma, the newsletter for the UFO Study Groupof greater St. Louis, comments that Tesla did the basic research forconstructing electromagnetic field lift-and-drive aircraft/spacecraft. From 1891to 1893, he gave a set of lectures and demonstrations to groups of electricalengineers.As part of each show, Tesla stood in the middle of the stage, using his 6' 6\"height, with an assistant on either side, each seven feet away. All three menwore thick cork or rubber shoe soles to avoid being electrically grounded. Eachassistant held a wire, part of a high voltage, low current circuit.When Tesla raised his arms to each side, violet colored electricity jumpedharmlessly across the gaps between the men. At high voltage and frequency inthis arrangement, electricity flows over a surface, even the skin, rather thaninto it. This is a basic circuit that could be used by aircraft/spacecraft.The hull is best made double, of thin, machinable, slightly flexible ceramic.This becomes a good electrical insulator, has no fire danger, resists anydamaging effects of severe heat and cold, and has the hardness of armor, besidesbeing easy for magnetic fields to pass through. The inner hull is covered onit's outside by wedge shaped thin metal sheets of copper or aluminum, bonded tothe ceramic. Each sheet is three to four feet wide at the horizontal rim of thehull and tapers to a few inches wide at the top of the hull for the top set ofmetal sheets, or at the bottom for the bottom set of sheets. Each sheet isseparated on either side by 1 or 2 inches of uncovered ceramic hull.The top set of sheets and bottom set of sheets are separated by about 6 inchesof uncovered ceramic hull around the horizontal rim of the hull. The outer hullprotects these sheets from being short-circuited by wind blown metal foil (AirForce radar confusing chaff), heavy rain or concentrations of gasoline orkerosene fumes.If unshielded, fuel fumes could be electrostatically attracted to the hullsheets, burn and form carbon deposits across the insulating gaps between thesheets, causing a short-circuit. The space, the outer hull with a slightnegative charge, would absorb hits from micro-meteorites and cosmic rays(protons moving at near the speed of light).Any danger of this type that doesn't already have a negative electric chargewould get a negative charge in hitting the outer hull, and be repelled by themetal sheets before it could hit the inner hull. The hull can be made in avariety of different shapes; sphere, football, disc, or streamlined rectangle ortriangle, as long as these metal sheets, “are of considerable area and arrangedalong ideal enveloping surfaces of very large radii of curvature,” p. 85, MyInventions, by Nikola Tesla.The power plant for this machine can be a nuclear fission or fusion reactor forlong range and long-term use to run a steam engine that turns the generators. Ashort-range machine can use a hydrogen oxygen fuel cell to run a low-voltagemotor to turn the generators, occasionally recharging by hovering next to highvoltage power lines and using antennas mounted on the outer hull to take in theelectricity. The short-range machine can also have electricity beamed to it froma generating plant on a long-range aircraft/spacecraft or on the ground.One standard for the generators is to have the same number of magnets as fieldcoils. Tesla's preferred design was a thin disc holding 480 magnets with 480field coils wired in series surrounding it in close tolerance. At 50 revolutionsper minute, it produces 19,400 cycles per second.The electricity is fed into a number of large capacitors, one for each metalsheet. An automatic switch, adjustable in timing by the pilot, closes, and asthe electricity jumps across the switch, back and forth, it raises its ownfrequency a switch being used for each capacitor.The electricity goes into a Tesla transformer; again, one transformer for eachcapacitor. In an oil tank to insulate the windings and for cooling, andsupported internally by wood, or plastic, pipe and fittings, each Teslatransformer looks like a short wider pipe that is moved along a longer, narrowerpipe by an insulated non-electric cable handle. The short pipe, the primary, issix to ten windings (loops) of wire connected in series to the long pipe. Thesecondary is 460 to 600 windings, at the low voltage and frequency end.The insulated non-electric cable handle is used through a set of automaticcontrols to move the primary coil to various places on the secondary coil. Thisis the frequency control. The secondary coil has a low frequency and voltage endand a maximum voltage and frequency end. The greater the frequency theelectricity, the more it pushes against the earth's electrostatic andelectromagnetic fields.The electricity comes out of the transformer at the high voltage end and goes bywire through the ceramic hull to the wide end of the metal sheet. Theelectricity jumps out on, and flows over the metal sheet, giving off a verystrong electromagnetic field, controlled by the transformer. At the narrow endof the metal sheet, most of the high-voltage push, having been given off theelectricity, goes back by wire through the hull to a circuit breaker box (anemergency shut off). In bright sunlight, the aircraft/spacecraft may seemsurrounded by hot air, a slight magnetic distortion of the light. Insemi-darkness and night, the metal sheets glow, even through the thin ceramicouter hull, with different colors. The visible light is a by-product of theelectricity flowing over the metal sheets, according to the frequencies used.Descending, landing or just starting to lift from the ground, the transformerprimaries are near the secondary weak ends and therefore, the bottom set ofsheets glow a misty red. Red may also appear at the front of the machine when itis moving forward fast, lessening resistance up front.Orange appears for slow speed. Orange-yellow are for airplane-type speeds. Greenand blue are for higher speeds. With a capacitor addition, making it oversizedfor the circuit, the blue becomes bright white, like a searchlight, withpossible risk of damaging the metal sheets involved.The highest visible frequency is violet, like Tesla's stage demonstrations, usedfor the highest speed along with the bright white. The colors are nearlycoherent, of a single frequency, like a laser. A machine built with a set ofsuper conducting magnets would simplify and reduce electricity needs from avehicle’s transformer circuits to the point of flying along efficiently andhovering with very little waste of electricity.When Tesla was developing arc lights to run on alternating current, there was abothersome high-pitched whine, whistle, or buzz, due to the electrodes rapidlyheating and cooling. Tesla put this noise in the ultrasonic range with thespecial transformer already mentioned. The aircraft/spacecraft gives off suchnoises when working at low frequencies.Timing is important in the operation of this machine. For every three metalsheets, when the middle one is briefly turned off, the sheet on either side isenergized, giving off the magnetic field. The next instant, the middle sheet isenergized, while the sheet on either side is briefly turned off.There is a time delay in the capacitors recharging themselves, so at any time,half of all the metal sheets are energized and the other half are recharging,alternating all around the inner hull. This balances the machine, giving it verygood stability. This balance is less when fewer of the circuits are in use.At close range, the aircraft/spacecraft produces heating of persons and objectson the ground; but by hovering over an area at low altitude for maybe five orten minutes, the machine also produces a column of very cold air down to theground. As air molecules get into the strong magnetic fields that the machine istransmitting out, the air molecules become polarized and from lines, or strings,of air molecules.The normal movement of the air is stopped, and there is suddenly a lot more roomfor air molecules in this area, so more air pours in. This expansion and thelack of normal air motion make the area intensely cold. This is also the reasonthat the aircraft/spacecraft can fly at supersonic speeds without making sonicbooms. As air flows over the hull, top and bottom, the air molecules form linesas they go through the magnetic fields of the metal sheet circuits. As the airmolecules are left behind, they keep their line arrangements for a short time;long enough to cancel out the sonic boom shock waves.Outside the earth's magnetic field, another propulsion system must be used, thatrelies on the first. You may have read of particle accelerators, or cyclotrons,or atom smashers. A particle accelerator is a circular loop of pipe that, incross-section, is oval.In a physics laboratory, most of the air in it is pumped out. The pipe loop isgiven a static electric charge; a small amount of hydrogen or other gas is giventhe same electric charge so the particles won't stick to the pipe. A set ofelectromagnets all around the pipe loop turn on and off, one after the other,pushing with one magnetic pole and pulling with the next, until those gasparticles are racing around the pipe loop at nearly the speed of light.Centrifugal force makes the particles speed closer to the outside edge of thepipe loop, still within the pipe. The particles break down into electrons, orlight and other wavelengths, protons or cosmic rays, and neutrons if more thanhydrogen is put in the accelerator.At least two particle accelerators are used to balance each other and countereach other's tendency to make the craft spin. Otherwise, the machine would tendto want to start spinning, following the direction of the force being applied tothe particles. The accelerators push in opposite directions to prevent spinning.The high-speed particles go out through straight lengths of pipe, charged likethe loops and in speeding out into space, push the machine along. This allowsvery long-range acceleration and later deceleration at normal (earth) gravity.This avoids the severe problems of weightlessness, including lowered physicalabilities of the crew. It is possible to use straight-line particleaccelerators, even as few as one per machine, but these do not seem as able toget the best machine speed for the least amount of particles pushed out.Using a constant acceleration of 32.2 feet per second provides earth normalgravity in deep space and only two gravities of stress in leaving the earth'sgravity field. It takes, not counting air resistance, 18 minutes, 58.9521636seconds to reach the 25,000 miles per hour speed to leave the earth’s gravityfield.A shortwave radio can be used to find the exact frequencies that an aircraft/spacecraft is using, for each of the colors it may show; a color television canshow the same overall color frequency that the nearby, but not extremely close,craft is using. This is limited in its use, as a machine traveling at the speedof a jet airliner may broadcast in a frequency range usually used for radarsets.The craft circuits would tend to override lower voltage electric circuits withinand near their electromagnetic fields. One source briefly mentioned a 1941incident, where a shortwave radio was used to override automobile ignitionsystems, up to three miles away. How many UFO encounters have been reported inwhich automobile ignition systems have suddenly stopped working in the presenceof a low-flying UFO?[Image00007.gif]TESLA’S CONNECTION TO PROJECT RAINBOWNikola Tesla has recently been the subject of controversy due to the claims ofAl Bielek and Preston Nichols. These men have reported in a number of books andarticles that Tesla was involved in one of the most disputed mysteries of WorldWar II, The Philadelphia Experiment. The Philadelphia Experiment, otherwiseknown as Project Rainbow, was allegedly an attempt by the Navy to create a shipthat could not be detected by magnetic mines and or radar. However, its resultswere said to be far different and much more dangerous than the Navy everexpected.In the early 1930's, the University of Chicago investigated the possibility ofinvisibility through the use of electricity. This project was later moved toPrinceton's Institute of Advanced Studies where it was named Project Rainbow(project invisibility), and was founded in 1936.Nicola Tesla was named Director of the project. Tesla was given anything thatwas required by him for the testing of the project. Tesla required and was givena navy battle ship on which the experiments were to be tested. The first actualtest of invisibility occurred in 1940 and was slated as a full success when anavy ship with no crew on board vanished from this plane of existence.The basic design had two large Tesla coils (electromagnets) placed on each hullof the ship. The coils are turned on in a special sequence and their magneticforce is so powerful that they warp gravity itself. Based in part on Tesla’searlier electrogravitic experiments, Project Rainbow proved to be far moredangerous than was originally conceived. Al Bielek, who passed away in 2011,claimed that Tesla began to have doubts about the safety of the experiment.“Tesla had a press announcement in 1923 where he stated he was talking with ET'soff planet. Now after he retired from RCA he maintained a laboratory in hisliving quarters at the Hotel New Yorker. Unknown to most people he had a secondlaboratory which apparently was his main one on top of the Waldorf Astoria onthe top floor and both penthouse towers.“He maintained a transmitter setup on the Waldorf; and his receiving setup, hisreceiving antennas and receivers which had been built by RCA under hisdirection, were on the New Yorker. And I know two people who said they wereworking with Tesla, during that period, that he was using that equipment, he wastalking with somebody, virtually every day, and one of them was emphatic: it wassomeone off planet. In plain language, he was communicating with ET's.”Tesla stated that there would be a serious problem with personnel if anyone wereto enter the ship while the gauss coils were turned on and the Electro Magneticradiation would damage them within this reality. He said in numerous occasionsthat he was in contact with extraterrestrials and that the ET's had confirmedthat there would be a problem with the experiment.Tesla wanted to clarify the problem before any farther experiments. However, theNavy said no, they were fighting a war and wanted immediate results. On thesecond experiment, Tesla, fearing that there would be people hurt or killed inthe experiment, sabotaged the 1942 test. He de-tuned the equipment so nothingwould work and the test failed. Tesla resigned in March 1942.CHAPTER SEVEN FREE ENERGY - FACT OR FICTION?While in college Tesla thought it could be possible to operate an electricalmotor without sparking brushes. The professor told him that such a motor wouldrequire perpetual motion and was therefore impossible. Tesla was determined toprove him wrong.In the 1880's, despite his professor’s scoffs, Tesla patented the alternatingcurrent generator, motor, and transformer. During the 1890's he intensivelyinvestigated other methods of power generation including a charged particlecollector patented in 1901.When the New York Times in June of 1902 carried a story about an inventor whoclaimed he had invented an electrical generator that did not require a primemover in the form of an external fuel supply, Tesla wrote a friend that he hadalready invented such a device.Tesla claimed the invention was an electrical generator that would not consumeany fuel. Such a generator would be its own prime mover and was utterlyimpossible according to modern scientists.Ninety to a hundred years ago, everybody knew that a heavier-than-air machinecould not possibly fly. It would violate the laws of physics. This was thelearned opinion of practically all of the so-called experts on the matter.For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901, “The demonstration that no possiblecombination of known substances, known forms of machinery and known forms offorce, can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly longdistances through the air.”Fortunately, a few people such as the Wright Brothers wouldn’t accept suchpronouncements as the final word. Now we take heavier than air flight forgranted. Today, orthodox physicists and other scientists are saying similarthings against the idea of free energy technologies. They use negative termssuch as pseudoscience and perpetual motion, and citing physical laws that assertthat energy cannot be created or destroyed (1st law of thermodynamics), andthere is always a decrease in useful energy (2nd law of thermodynamics).Free energy inventions are devices that can tap a seemingly unlimited supply ofenergy from the universe, without burning any kind of fuel, creating the perfectsolution to the worldwide energy crisis and its associated pollution,degradation, and depletion of the environment. Most free energy devices probablydo not create energy, but rather tap into existing natural energy sources byvarious forms of induction. Unlike solar or wind devices, free energy devicesneed little or no energy storage capacity, because they can tap as much energyas needed when needed. Properly designed, free energy devices do not have anylimitations.In The Brooklyn Eagle newspaper, Tesla announced, on July 10, 1931, that, “Ihave harnessed the cosmic rays and caused them to operate a motive device.”Later on in the same article, he stated, “More than 25 years ago I began myefforts to harness the cosmic rays and I can now state that I have succeeded.”In 1933, he made the same assertion in an article for the New York American,under the lead in Device to Harness Cosmic Energy Claimed by Tesla.“This new power for the driving of the world's machinery will be derived fromthe energy which operates the universe, the cosmic energy, whose central sourcefor the earth is the sun and which is everywhere present in unlimitedquantities.”Dating back more than 25 years ago from 1933 would mean that the device Teslawas speaking about must have been built before 1908. Almost certainly, the ideahad occurred to Tesla years earlier. More precise information is availablethrough his correspondence located at the Columbia University Library.ELECTRICITY WITHOUT BURNING FUELWriting on June 10, 1902 to his friend Robert U. Johnson, editor of CenturyMagazine, Tesla included a clipping from the previous day's New York Heraldabout Clemente Figueras, a woods and forest engineer in Las Palmas, capital ofthe Canary Islands, who had invented a device for generating electricity withoutburning fuel.What became of Figueras and his fuel-less generator is not known, but thisannouncement in the paper prompted Tesla, in his letter to Johnson, to claim hehad already developed such a device and had revealed the underlying physicallaws.Other U.S. patents have been filed: (#3,811,058, #3,879,622, and #4,151,4310),for example, for motors that run exclusively on permanent energy, seeminglytapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic field. The firsttwo require a feedback network in order to be self-running.The third one, (as described in detail in Science & Mechanics magazine, Spring1980), requires critical sizes, shapes, orientations, and spacing of magnets,but no feedback. Such a motor could drive an electric generator or reversibleheat pump in one's home, year round, at no cost. [Complete descriptive copies ofU.S. patents are $3.00 each from the U.S. Patent Office, 2021 Jefferson DavisHwy, Arlington, VA22202; correct 7-digit patent number required.]According to Oliver Nichelson, who has made extensive studies of Tesla and freeenergy machines, the device that, at first, seems to best fit Tesla’s claims isfound in his patent for an “Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy”Number 685,957,that was filed for on March 21, 1901 and granted on November 5,1901.The concept behind the older technical language is incredibly simple—aninsulated metal plate is put as high as possible into the air. Another metalplate is set into the ground. A wire runs from the metal plate to one side of acapacitor and a second wire goes from the ground plate to the other side of thecapacitor.The sun, as well as other sources of radiant energy, throw off minute particlesof matter positively electrified, which, impinging upon [the upper] plate,communicate continuously an electrical charge to the same. The opposite terminalof the condenser being connected to ground, which may be considered as a vastreservoir of negative electricity, a feeble current flows continuously into thecondenser and inasmuch as the particles are charged to a very high potential,this charging of the condenser can continue almost indefinitely, even to thepoint of rupturing the dielectric.Today, we would call this device a solar-electric panel. Tesla's invention isvery different though, but the closest thing to it in conventional technology isin photovoltaics. One radical difference is that conventional solar-electricpanels consist of a substrate coated with crystalline silicon; the latest useamorphous silicon.Conventional solar panels are expensive, and, whatever the coating, they aremanufactured by esoteric processes. However, Tesla's solar panel is just a shinymetal plate with a transparent coating of an insulating material. Stick one ofthese antenna-like panels up in the air, the higher the better, and wire it toone side of a capacitor, the other going to a good earth ground. Now the energyfrom the sun is charging that capacitor. Connect across the capacitor some sortof switching device so that it can be discharged at rhythmic intervals, and youhave an electric output.Tesla’s patent tells us that it is very simple to get electric energy. Thebigger the area of the insulated plate, the more energy you get. However, thisis more than a solar panel because it does not necessarily need sunshine tooperate. It also produces power at night.Of course, this is impossible according to official science. For this reason,you could not get a patent on such an invention today. Tesla's free energyreceiver refers to the sun, as well as other sources of radiant energy, likecosmic rays. That the device works at night is explained in terms of thenighttime availability of cosmic rays. Tesla also refers to the ground as a vastreservoir of negative electricity.Tesla was fascinated by radiant energy and its free energy possibilities. Hecalled the Crooke's radiometer (a device which has vanes that spin in a vacuumwhen exposed to radiant energy) a beautiful invention. He believed that it wouldbecome possible to harness energy directly by connecting to the very wheelworkof nature.This seems like a very straightforward design and would seem to fulfill hisclaim for having developed a fuel-less generator powered by cosmic rays, but in1900 Tesla wrote what he considered his most important article in which hedescribes a self-activating machine that would draw power from the ambientmedium, a fuel less generator, that is different from his Radiant Energy Device.Entitled: The Problem of Increasing Human Energy - Through the Use of the Sun,the article was published by his friend Robert Johnson in The CenturyIllustrated Monthly Magazine for June 1900. The title of the chapter where hediscusses this device is called: A Departure From Known Methods, Possibility ofa “Self Acting” Engine or Machine, Inanimate, Yet Capable, Like an Living Being,of Deriving Energy From the Medium—The Ideal Way of Obtaining Motive Power.Tesla stated he first started thinking about the idea when he read a statementby Lord Kelvin who said it was impossible to build a mechanism capable ofabstracting heat from the surrounding medium and to operate by that heat. Teslaenvisioned a very long bundle of metal rods, extending from the earth to outerspace.The Earth is warmer than outer space so heat would be conducted up the barsalong with an electric current. Then, all that would be needed is a very longpower cord to connect the two ends of the metal bars to a motor. The motor wouldcontinue running until the earth was cooled to the temperature of outer space.Of course, now we wouldn’t need a power cord to connect the two ends Bmicrowaves would serve.This would be an inanimate engine that, to all evidence, would be cooling aportion of the medium below the temperature of the surrounding, and operating bythe heat abstracted, that is, it would produce energy directly from theenvironment without the consumption of any material.Tesla goes on in the article to describe how he worked on the development ofsuch an energy device. Unfortunately, Tesla was not exactly clear on which ofhis inventions he meant. He wrote that he first started thinking about derivingenergy directly from the environment when he was in Paris during 1883, but thathe was unable to do much with the idea for several years due to the commercialintroduction of his alternating current generators and motors. It was not until1889 when he again took up the idea of the self-acting machine.In 1893, Tesla applied for a patent on an electrical coil that is the mostlikely candidate for a non-mechanical successor of his energy extractor. This ishis “Coil for Electro-magnets,” patent #512,340. It is a curious design, unlikean ordinary coil made by turning wire on a tube form, this one uses two wireslaid next to each other on a form but with the end of the first one connected tothe beginning of the second one.In the patent Tesla explains that this double coil will store many times theenergy of a conventional coil. The patent, however, gives no hint of what mighthave been its more unusual capability.In an article for Century Magazine, Tesla compares extracting energy from theenvironment to the work of other scientists who were, at that time, learning tocondense atmospheric gases into liquids. In particular, he cited the work of aDr. Karl Linde who had discovered what Tesla described as a self-cooling methodfor liquefying air.As Tesla said, “This was the only experimental proof which I was still wantingthat energy was obtainable from the medium in the manner contemplated by me.”What ties the Linde work with Tesla's electromagnet coil is that both of themused a double path for the material they were working with. Linde had acompressor to pump the air to a high pressure, let the pressure fall as ittraveled through a tube, and then used that cooled air to reduce the temperatureof the incoming air by having it travel back up the first tube through a secondtube enclosing the first.The already cooled air added to the cooling process of the machine and quicklycondensed the gases to a liquid. Tesla's intent was to condense the energytrapped between the earth and its upper atmosphere and to turn it into anelectric current.He pictured the sun as an immense ball of electricity, positively charged with apotential of some 200 billion volts. The Earth, on the other hand, is chargedwith negative electricity.The tremendous electrical force between these two bodies constituted, at leastin part, what he called cosmic-energy. It varied from night to day and fromseason to season but it is always present.Tesla's patents for electrical generators and motors were granted in the late1880's. During the 1890's the large electric power industry, in the form ofWestinghouse and General Electric, came into being. With tens of millions ofdollars invested in plants and equipment, the industry was not about to abandona very profitable ten-year-old technology for yet another new one.Tesla saw that profits could be made from the self-acting generator, butsomewhere along the line, it was pointed out to him the negative impact thedevice would have on the newly emerging technological revolution of the late19th and early 20th centuries.At the end of his article in Century he wrote, “I worked for a long time fullyconvinced that the practical realization of the method of obtaining energy fromthe sun would be of incalculable industrial value, but the continued study ofthe subject revealed the fact that while it will be commercially profitable ifmy expectations are well founded, it will not be so to an extraordinary degree.”Years later, in 1933, he was more pointed in his remarks about the introductionof his fuel-less generator. In the Philadelphia Public Ledger of November 2, isan interview with Tesla under the headline: Tesla 'Harnesses' Cosmic Energy.In it, he was asked whether the sudden introduction of his principle would upsetthe present economic system, Dr. Tesla replied, “It is badly upset already.” Headded, “Now as never before was the time ripe for the development of newresources.” At a press conference to celebrate his 76th birthday, Teslaannounced that he had invented a cosmic-ray motor.When asked if it was more powerful than the Crooke’s radiometer, he answered,“Thousands of times more powerful.” Tesla claimed that from the electricpotential that exists between the elevated plate (plus) and the ground (minus),energy builds in the capacitor, and, after a suitable time interval, theaccumulated energy will manifest itself in a powerful discharge.Unfortunately, this invention, as so many others that Tesla claimed near the endof his life, was allegedly never developed…at least it was never developedpublicly. When he died, there were in all, the approximate equivalent of arailroad boxcar load of Tesla materials confiscated by the government, fromaround four different storage locations.Of this, only about 150,000 documents were released to Tesla's Yugoslavianrelatives, now held by the Tesla Institute in Belgrade. These documents and oldmodels, primarily of a historical nature, comprise most of the published Teslamaterials of the institute. The Custodian of Alien Properties retained a hugevolume of documents and models in an unclassified state, because thegovernment's experts had declared that none of it was worth classifying. From1943 until 1945, when, following the arrival of the Nazi scientists and thesecret war files of Nazi Germany, acquired under Operation Paperclip, officialsfrom Wright-Patterson Air Force Base hurried up to the warehouses of theCustodian of Alien Properties, and took possession of all the documents andother materials, all which were classified at the highest level.The remainder of Tesla’s papers in government hands is still classified. Thereare literally tons of notes, documents, drawings, and plans, as well as the overtwenty boxes of still missing Tesla material. The government distributed falserumors that Tesla never kept notes, which was a blatant lie.To this day, there is no way of knowing whether or not Tesla’s cosmic ray motorwas practical or not. However, evidence found in Tesla’s lost journals seems toindicate that free energy is possible and within the framework of known science.Richard (Scott) McKie designed and tested in 1991 a small model of a Power OnDemand MODule. The circuitry invokes Tesla's theories of electron flow,resonance, and magnetism, combined with modern theories on high frequencyelectronics and radio antennas to generate power directly, without theinefficient conversion of energy from other sources.FREE ENERGY RESEARCH TODAYPatrick G. Bailey, Ph. D. in his Review Of Zero Point Energy And Free EnergyTheory, Progress, And Devices B writes that the study of the free energy fieldoverlaps with quite a number of other areas of science and technology that arenot well understood, and are usually called “fringe areas.”Bailey believes that responsible investigations in these areas do uncoverimportant information and data that can relate to various questions that occurin the study of free energy.These questions include: Why is this research not conducted? Is it suppressed?Why is it suppressed? Are there other examples of such suppression? Where can Iget more information? Are there any examples of such advanced relatedtechnologies? If such energy sources exist, has anyone found out how to usethem? How do they work? Can I use them, and can I use them in a responsiblemanner?There is a great outcry by those familiar with our current energy policy and thepublic electricity utility network for need of a new breakthrough in thetechnology of energy production. Dr. Gary Johnson, a college professor and IEEESenior Member, recently published a short review of the researchers in this areain a noted US technical journal and concluded his four page report with thestatement:“There is a great deal of noise in the literature. Some concepts are obviouslynonsense. Others will prove to be in error. But is there any signal in all thenoise? There is if Tesla, Moray, and Bearden are correct. The potential payoffis enormous, so the search should be continued if there is any chance at all ofsuccess.”Also, Llewellen King, publisher of The Energy Daily, Defense Week, andEnvironmental Week newsletters in Washington DC recently strongly anddramatically stated in a speech to an international technical conference, “Wehave failed with energy to come up with the ‘Great Big Breakthrough!’ ‘The MajorChange.’ ‘The Radically Different Thing.’ ‘The Quantum Leap Forward.’ Where isthe jump from a copper wire to a fiber or to a cable? Where is the equivalent offiber optics for electricity? ... The new technologies such asmagnetohydrodynamics, (are advancing and coming forth), and yet these thingshave not fostered, and we are still boiling water! It is theoretically possiblethat we could at some point take this ‘Quantum Leap Forward’ ... And in order todo that, I believe that you will need new institutions to deploy new technology.“They won't be deployed by the extant of the old institutions. The challenge intechnology is to find It, and then sell It, and finally to deploy It.”Is there a conspiracy to suppress free energy devices—like the suppression thatconfronted Tesla with his free-energy receiver? There is the possibility thatthere is a collection and network of vested interest groups that seem to tightlyband together for mutual financial survival. The actions taken by any of thesegroups may be completely independent from the others. As well, some sort ofcontrol and suppression in the press seems very evident. Ken MacNeill publishedin 1983 a very disturbing article entitled “Insights into the ProprietarySyndrome,” in which he points out that over 3,000 patents have been suppressed!Two historical events are worth including here regarding possible suppressionand inability to commercialize free energy devices. These are the Over-UnityDevice of T. Henry Moray, and the Hindershot Motor. Both of these devices werepublicly demonstrated to the US press in the 1930s, and carefully conductedtests were made to assess these devices. From the newspaper reports andclippings, it appears that both devices passed all tests, only to fall intooblivion. What exactly happened to the devices, their inventors, and thetechnology is not known. It also appears that the secrets of the devices diedwith their inventors.Toby Grotz has presented theory and results of Project Tesla to determine if theearth's electrostatic (atmospheric) Schumann Cavity can be resonated, if thepower that is delivered to the cavity propagates with very low losses, and ifpower can be extracted at other locations within the cavity. Toby Grotz alsopresented a theoretical analysis of Tesla's “Death Ray” (1991).By carefully examining historical records, this 1937 design was probably thefirst attempt to construct a high voltage particle beam device. Tesla'sestimates indicate that a five-meter diameter metal sphere charged to 60 millionvolts could project a high-energy charged particle beam up to 60 kilometersthrough the air in a given direction.In 1991, Oliver Nichelson summarized two of Tesla's later energy generationdevice designs, including a turbine-shaped Unipolar Dynamo design for a machinethat can continue to produce electricity after being disconnected from anoutside power source. This paper is also important because it also describesTesla's “Coil for Electro-Magnetics,” patented in 1893.FOLLOWING IN TESLA’S FOOTPRINTSIn the early 1900's, Dr. T. Henry Moray of Salt Lake City produced his firstdevice to tap energy from the metafrequency oscillations of empty space itself.Eventually Moray was able to produce a free energy device weighing sixty poundsand producing 50,000 watts of electricity for several hours. Ironically,although he demonstrated his device repeatedly to scientists and engineers,Moray was unable to obtain funding to develop the device further into a useablepower station that would furnish electrical power on a mass scale. Like Tesla,Moray had run afoul of those who had an “energy monopoly” and were not willingto share.When he was a boy, Moray was deeply inspired by Nikola Tesla. Moray wasespecially enthusiastic by Tesla's claims of free energy, and his emphasis onfrequencies as the stuff of the universe. When Moray finished high school hewent abroad to study, and took resident examinations for his doctorate inelectrical engineering from the University of Uppsala, Sweden, during the period1912-14.Moray at first theorized that energy was coming from within the earth. Throughcontinuous experimentation and in spite of the doubts held by the scientificcommunity of the day, he discovered that the energy was not coming from theground but from an outside source away from the earth.The energy came in continuous surges, like waves of the sea, more in the daytimethan at night. At this time Moray had enough power to light a 16-candle powercarbon lamp at about one-half capacity. He labeled and defined his “RadiantEnergy: the source of energy coming from the cosmos to the earth and radiatingback from whence it came.”Around 1920, Moray produced his first elementary device that deliveredmeasurable electrical power, and he continued to work diligently on energydevices when he had time. In the 1920's and 1930's he steadily improved hisdevices, particularly his detector tube, the only real secret of the deviceaccording to Moray himself.In his book, The Sea Of Energy In Which The Earth Floats, Moray presentsdocumented evidence that he invented the first transistor-type valve in 1925. Inhis free energy detector tube, Moray apparently used, inside the tube itself, avariation of this transistor idea, a small rounded pellet of a mixture oftriboluminescent zinc, a semiconductor material, and a radioactive material.Channeling the waves of energy was done by way of an antenna. When set up andconnected to the ground, primed and tuned, the device would draw electricalenergy. Results of this experimentation proved that the power generation had notoriginated from within the device. The device, through channeling radiantenergy, produced up to 50,000 Watts of power and worked for long periods oftime.According to John Moray, the machine, which is in subharmonic resonance withthis high-frequency energy level, taps highly energetic cosmic rays from spaceand it converts this energy level into a usable form of electricity. However,John Moray's use of the term “cosmic ray” is not necessarily the same as that ofmodern physics, but in fact is the same as the present concept of zero-pointenergy of vacuum.Moray envisioned all space filled with tremendously high frequency vibrationscarrying vast and incalculable amounts of pure raw energy. He envisioned thedynamic Universe as a turbulent source of great energy, just as the ocean wavescarry energy throughout the earth. Tesla also shared this idea.Moray’s patent application (never granted) was filed on July 13, 1931, longbefore the advent of the Bell Laboratories' transistor. Moray successfullydemonstrated his radiant energy device to electrical engineering professors,Congressmen, dignitaries, and a host of other visitors to his laboratory. Morayeven moved his device several miles out in the country, away from all powerlines, to prove that he was not simply tuning in to energy being clandestinelyradiated from some other part of his laboratory.Several times he allowed independent investigators to completely disassemble hisdevice and reassemble it, then reactivate it themselves. In all tests, he wassuccessful in demonstrating that the device could produce energy output withoutany appreciable energy input. According to exhaustive documentation, no one wasever able to prove that the device was fraudulent or that Moray had notaccomplished exactly what he claimed.On the other hand, the records are full of signed statements from physicists,electrical engineers, and scientists who came to the Moray laboratory asskeptics and left convinced that Moray had succeeded in tapping a universalsource of energy that could produce free electrical power.Nevertheless, despite his successes, the U.S. Patent Office refused to grantMoray a patent. First, because his device used a cold cathode in the tubes (thepatent examiner asserted it was common knowledge that a heated cathode wasnecessary to obtain electrons) and, second, because he failed to identify thesource of the energy.All sorts of irrelevant patents and devices were also presented as beinginfringed upon or duplicated by Moray's work. Each of these objections waspatiently answered and nullified by Moray; nonetheless, the patent has still notbeen issued to this day, although Moray’s family still keep the patentapplication current.According to writer Tom Bearden, one of Moray's efforts to develop the machineinvolved an association with the Rural Electrification Agency for a short timebefore World War II. At that time, the R.E.A. was apparently infiltrated at thehighest levels by Communist sympathizers. These officials continually urgedMoray to turn over all details of his device to the Soviet Union, and evenarranged the visit of high-level Soviet scientists to the Moray laboratory tosee the device in operation.More than likely, because of Moray’s dealings with the R.E.A., much of hisimportant work was obtained clandestinely by the Soviet Union. Beardenspeculates that Moray’s work inspired the Soviets to develop the hyperspaceamplifiers later used in their psychotronic weapons.Moray became quite alarmed at the continued attempts of his R.E.A. contacts toget the device into the hands of the Russians. He eventually concluded that hehad become involved with a governmental group filled with radicals andreactionaries. Much like Tesla, Moray became concerned that fifth columnactivity was actually directed against him in an attempt to steal his device.Mysteriously, Moray was wounded by a gunshot in his own laboratory on March 2,1940. No details have ever surfaced concerning who fired the shot or if Moraywas the intended target. Moray finally discontinued his association with theR.E.A. in February 1941.Unfortunately, Moray’s basic unit was destroyed in 1939 by a man who had wantedMoray to fully disclose the inner workings and construction of his device. InMoray's day there was no theory predicting that empty space contained prodigiousquantities of energy. Modern followers of quantum geometrodynamics assert thetruth of Tesla's original vision. Today we know that one cubic centimeter ofpure vacuum contains enough energy to condense into 1080 B 10120 grams ofmatter. Thus the major part of Tesla and Moray's thesis—that vacuum itselfcontains unlimited energy—is vindicated today.THE MYSTERY OF THE TESLA ELECTRIC CARWith the high price of gasoline and the ever-growing concern for ourenvironment, the concept of the all-electric car is once again being consideredby the major auto manufacturers. Unfortunately, the problem with battery weightand storage still makes electric cars economically unfeasible.In an article by Arthur Abrom for the Dallas Morning News, it was pointed outthat electric powered automobiles were one of the earliest considerations andthis mode of propulsion enjoyed a brief but short reign. In the early days ofautomobile development, electric propulsion was considered and used.An electric powered automobile possessed many advantages that the noisy,cantankerous, smoke-belching gasoline cars could not offer. First is theabsolute silence one experiences when riding in an electrically powered vehicle.There is not even a hint of noise. One simply turns a key and steps on theaccelerator—the vehicle moves instantly. No cranking from the start, no crank toturn (this was before electric starters), no pumping of the accelerator, nospark control to advance and no throttle linkage to pre-set before starting. Onesimply turned the ignition switch to on and away you went.If one wants to increase speed, you simply depress the accelerator. Further,there is never any hesitation. Releasing the accelerator causes the vehicle toslow down immediately; you are always in complete control. It is not difficultto understand why these vehicles were so very popular around the turn of thecentury and until around 1915.The big disadvantage to these cars then, and even today, was their range andneed for recharging every night. All of these electric vehicles used a series ofbatteries and a D.C. motor. The batteries require constant recharging and therange of travel was restricted to about 100 miles. Many of the large departmentstores in metropolitan areas began purchasing delivery trucks that wereelectrically powered. They were silent and emitted no pollutants. They werepractically the perfect car.Maintenance was a minimum on electrically powered vehicles. There were fewmechanics and garages in operation in the early 1900's. Therefore, city life andtravel appeared to be willing to embrace the electric automobile. Two thingshappened to dampen the popularity of the electric automobile. One was thesubconscious craving for speed that gripped all auto enthusiasts of this era.Electric vehicles could not reach speeds of 45 or 50 M.P.H. for this would havedestroyed the batteries in moments. Bursts of speeds of 25 to 35 M.P.H. could bemaintained for a moment or so.Normal driving speed, depending upon traffic conditions, was 15 to 20 M.P.H. by1900 to 1910 standards; this was an acceptable speed limit to obtain from yourelectric vehicle. As well, the electric automobile could not be adapted toaccommodate and utilize Tesla’s polyphase A.C. motor. So, somewhere around 1915or so, the electric automobile became just a memory.In 1931, under the financing of Pierce-Arrow and George Westinghouse, a 1931Pierce-Arrow was selected for tests at the factory grounds in Buffalo, N.Y. Thestandard internal combustion engine was removed and an 80-H.P. 1800 R.P.Melectric motor installed to the clutch and transmission. The A.C. motor measured40 inches long and 30 inches in diameter and the power leads were left standingin the air—no external power source.At the appointed time, Nikola Tesla arrived from New York City and inspected thePierce-Arrow automobile. He then went to a local radio store and purchased ahandful of tubes, wires and assorted resistors. A box measuring 24 inches long,12 inches wide and 6 inches high was assembled housing the circuit.The box was then placed on the front seat and had its wires connected to theair-cooled, brushless motor. Two rods 1/4\" in diameter stuck out of the boxabout 3\" in length. Mr. Tesla got into the driver's seat, pushed the two rods inand stated, “We now have power.” He put the car into gear and it moved forward.This vehicle, powered by an A.C. motor, was driven to speeds of 90 M.P.H. andperformed better than any internal combustion engine of its day. One week wasspent testing the vehicle. Several newspapers in Buffalo enthusiasticallyreported this test.When asked where the power came from, Tesla replied, “From the ethers all aroundus.” Several people suggested that Tesla was mad and somehow in league withsinister forces of the universe. He became incensed, quickly removed hismysterious box from the vehicle and returned to his laboratory in New York City.His secret apparently died with him.It is speculated that Tesla was able to somehow harness the earth's magneticfield that encompasses our planet. And, he somehow was able to draw tremendousamounts of power by cutting these lines of force or causing them to bemultiplied together. The exact nature of his device remains a mystery.In 1969, Joseph R. Zubris took his 1961 Mercury and pulled out the Detroitinternal combustion engine. He then installed an electric motor as a source ofpower. His unique wiring system cut the energy drain at starting to 75% ofnormal and doubled the electrical efficiency of the electric motor whenoperating.The U.S. Patent Office issued him a patent No. 3,809,978. Although he approachedmany concerns for marketing, no one really seemed to be interested and hisunique system is still not on the market.In the 1970's, an inventor used an Ev-Gray generator, which intensified batterycurrent, the voltage being induced to the field coils by a very simpleprogrammer (sequencer). By allowing the motor to charge separate batteries asthe device ran, phenomenally tiny currents were needed.The device was tested at the Crosby Research Institute of Beverly HillsCalifornia; a 10-horsepower EMA motor ran for over a week (9 days) on fourstandard automobile batteries. The inventors estimated that a 50-horsepowerelectric motor could traverse 300 miles at 50 M.P.H. before needing a re-charge.Dr. Keith E. Kenyon, the inventor from Van Nuys, California, discovered adiscrepancy in the normal and long accepted laws relating to electric motormagnets. Dr. Kenyon demonstrated his invention for many scientists and engineersin 1976. Unfortunately, their reaction to the demonstration was disappointing.Although admitting Dr. Kenyon's device worked, they saw little or no practicalapplication for it.The ultimate source for a successful electrically powered automobile would be tohave an electric motor that required no outside source of power. This soundsimpossible because it violates all current scientific thought. Nevertheless, ithas been invented and H.R. Johnson has been issued a patent No. 4,151,431 onApril 24, 1979 on such a device.This new design although originally suggested by Tesla in 1905, is a permanentmagnet motor. Mr. Johnson has arranged a series of permanent magnets on therotor and a corresponding series with different spacing on the stator. Onesimply has to move the stator into position and rotation of the rotor beginsimmediately.Johnson’s patent states, “The invention is directed to the method of utilizingthe unpaired electron spins in ferro-magnetic and other materials as a source ofmagnetic fields for producing power without any electron flow as occurs innormal conductors and to permanent magnet motors for utilization of this methodto produce a power source.In the practice of this invention, the unpaired electron spins occurring withinpermanent magnets are used to produce a motive power source solely through thesuper-conducting characteristics of a permanent magnet and the magnetic fluxcreated by the magnets are controlled and concentrated to orient the magneticforces generated in such a manner to do useful continuous work such as thedisplacement of a rotor with respect to a stator.The timing and orientation of special magnetic forces at the rotor and statorcomponents produced by permanent magnets to produce a motor is accomplished withthe proper geometrical relationship of these components. Engineers of HitachiMagnetics Corp. of California have stated that a motor run solely by magnets isfeasible and logical but the politics of the matter make it impossible for themto pursue developing a magnet motor or any device that would compete with theenergy cartels.In fact, it appears that such devices have been deliberately suppressed over theyears to prevent any competition from machines that can generate power without afuel source. This would put big oil and other energy cartels out of business.THE REAL REASON FOR TESLA’S INTEREST IN FREE ENERGYAccording to Tesla’s private journals, anomalous voice transmissions heard overhis special radio receivers, discussed the warming of the planet caused bynatural and manmade sources of atmospheric pollutants. Tesla was also left withthe impression that the unknown voices favored this outcome and may haveactually “hurried” the process along by encouraging the development of theinternal combustion engine.Tesla may have been the first human to learn about what is referred to today as“Global Warming” and the “Greenhouse Effect.” Tesla, convinced that the voiceshe was receiving were from a hostile extraterrestrial source, began a concertedeffort to develop a means of power that did not use the burning of wood orfossil fuels; an energy source that was clean and unlimited and would preventpollutants, at least manmade, from filling the atmosphere and causing theretention of heat from the sun.Tesla was the first to become aware of one of the most controversial subjects inconspiratorial circles today, Alternative Three and the destruction of Earth![Image00008.gif]CHAPTER EIGHT THE TRUTH ABOUT ALTERNATIVE 3Nikola Tesla became aware early in the 20th century that the planet was heatingup, so much so that by the end of the 21st century, Earth would be almostuninhabitable for the human species. Strangely enough, Tesla’s source ofinformation was the strange, disembodied voices he was picking up from hisspecially modified radio receiver.These mysterious voice broadcasts were the outcome of Tesla’s initial researchinto strange radio signals he picked up during his experiments at ColoradoSprings in 1899. By now, Tesla had improved his receiving equipment to enablehim to pickup voice broadcasts. However, these voices were heard on frequenciesthat supposedly, were unable to carry these kinds of transmissions, but theywere there nevertheless.What is not clear from Tesla’s descriptions of the mysterious broadcasts is whatlanguage these voices were speaking. It does not make sense that creatures fromspace would be broadcasting to each other in English, or some other languagethat Tesla was fluent. It was almost as if they desired someone on Earth to hearand understand them.Tesla told his assistants that these voices were of men from other worlds—menwho had lived on Earth sometime in its prehistoric past, had developed thetechnology to colonize other planets and were still interested in theinhabitants they had left behind. These men had colonized the planet Mars aswell as maintaining bases on the moon. Others of their kind had gone deeper intospace, out of our solar system altogether to explore the galaxy.These original earthly inhabitants had decided the Earth was to become a reserveso to speak, to allow nature to take its course and new species to evolve andfill the niches left vacant by the departure of its first inhabitants. However,some things were not left to nature alone. The first men decided to leave behindremnants of themselves in the form of our early ancestors. Tesla’s descriptionof the reseeding of planet Earth with intelligent hominids sounds very much likegenetic manipulation.This could explain why reports of UFO occupants, who claim extraterrestrialorigins, look so much like us. The majority of contacts with beings who step outof UFOs all agree on their human-like appearance. With very few exceptions, allalleged extraterrestrials possess very human features. One head with two eyes anose and a mouth, two arms, two hands with five fingers, two legs and feet. Manyhave been reported to be so human in appearance that they are indistinguishablefrom normal humans. Maybe this is because they are human…the first humans. Tesladied before the modern UFO wave, but his descriptions bear an uncannyresemblance to popularized UFO occupants.AN APRIL FOOLS JOKE TOO CLOSE TO THE TRUTHAt 9:00 PM on Monday June 20 1977, Anglia television based in Norwich UnitedKingdom, put out a one hour TV special. The program was to be simultaneouslytransmitted to a number of other countries that included Australia, New Zealand,Canada, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Greece, and Yugoslavia. The name ofthe TV special was called Alternative 3, it was to shock the nation, jam mediatelephone lines and rock the station's credibility.At 10:00 PM Anglia was besieged with calls from irate viewers demanding moreinformation. Callers were told not to panic, the program was simply an AprilFools hoax that had been pre-empted until June 20. However, many were notconvinced that it was a hoax.The following morning the Daily Express newspaper confirmed the program was ahoax and pointed out that Dr Carl Gerstein was none other than the well knownactor Richard Marner. Meanwhile back at Anglia there were rumors of industrialaction and the station was severely criticized for putting out the hoax. Angliagot a reprimand and the public were relieved of their fears.A respectable team of reporters who had a regular weekly slot titled ScienceReport put the Alternative 3 TV special together. It was an intelligentdocumentary series that reported on new scientific inventions. It was because ofthe teams' credibility that Alternative 3 was taken so seriously. The questionwas: Why would a serious investigative team who had a weekly documentary slotsuddenly produce a hoax?In 1976, the United Kingdom was plagued with “The Brain Drain,” a term used forthe mass exodus of some of the countries best surgeons and scientists which werebeing enticed with huge pay checks by the United States. There were also reportsof suicides and disappearances among scientists. As well, there were smallcommunities such as “Friends of the Earth,” and others who were just beginningto understand the ozone problem and global warming.By 1978, the story took on new life when Sphere Books published Alternative 3 byLeslie Watkins, David Ambrose and Christopher Miles. According to Watkins,Ambrose and Miles didn't help write the book, but their names were included forcopyright purposes because they had written the television program on which itwas based. Those who were able to get a hold of a copy read a story that was afollow-up of the TV special produced by Spectrum for Anglia TV.Both the book and the TV program focused on a number of amazing scenarios, allsaid to be factual.# There is a secret joint U.S./U.S.S.R. space program that has gone far beyondwhat the public sees. Astronauts landed on Mars in 1962. It has been discoveredthat there is other intelligent life in the universe and they are observing andinteracting with the inhabitants of Earth. The Earth is dying due to natural andmanmade pollutants. The increasing Greenhouse Effect will cause the polar icecaps and glaciers to melt and flood the Earth.# Extreme heat, such as that which is now inevitable, will melt land glaciers.That will result in a marked rise in sea level and then there will be the startof the extensive flooding - with London and New York among the first cities tobe flooded (Alternative 3).There are three possible solutions for humanity: Alternative 1 - Stop allpollution immediately and blow two huge holes in the ozone layer. This wouldallow excessive UV light to reach the Earth and millions would die of skincancer.Alternative 2 - Immediately begin digging underground cities for world leaders,the very rich and leaders of big business and a few selected scientists. Theremainder of the population will be left to perish on the polluted surface.Alternative 3 - Build spaceships and get the Elite off the planet - to the moonand Mars. Kidnap and take along some “ordinary” people for use as slave labor.Use mind control techniques to control them. Leave the remainder of humanity todie on the planet.Was the Anglia Television program fact or fiction? Reporter Georginia Brunispoke to Christopher Miles, who also directed and co-wrote the program. Milesadmitted that the program was entirely fiction, but he now suspects that theymay have accidentally come a little too close to the hidden truth withAlternative 3.The writer of the book, Leslie Watkins, was a writer of thrillers even beforeAlternative 3. The Fortean Times recently printed an article in which NickAustin, then editorial director of Sphere Books, revealed how he commissionedLeslie Watkins to write the book version at the behest of literary agent MurrayPollinger. Watkins, in a letter to Windwords Bookstore, outlined his beliefsconcerning the mystery surrounding Alternative 3, and how he may haveaccidentally stumbled upon top-secret truths that others wanted to be keptquiet.“The book Alternative 3 is based on fact, but uses that fact as a launch pad fora HIGH DIVE INTO FICTION. In answer to specific questions:1) There is no astronaut named Grodin.2) There is no Sceptre Television and the reported Benson is also fictional.3) There is no Dr. Gerstein.4) Yes, a “documentary” was televised in June 1977 on Anglia Television, whichwent out to the entire national network in Britain. It was called Alternative 3and was written by David Ambrose and produced by Christopher Miles (whose nameswere on the book for contractual reasons). This original TV version, which IEXPANDED IMMENSELY for the book, was ACTUALLY A HOAX that had been scheduled fortransmission on April Fools' Day. Because of certain problems in finding theright network slot, the transmission was delayed.“The TV program did cause a tremendous uproar because viewers refused to believeit was fiction. I initially took the view that the basic premise was so way out;particularly the way I aimed to present it in the book, that no one would regardit as non-fiction. Immediately after publication, I realized I was totallywrong. In fact, the amazing mountains of letters from virtually all parts of theworld, including vast numbers from highly intelligent people in positions ofresponsibility, convinced me that I had ACCIDENTALLY trespassed into a range oftop-secret truths.“Documentary evidence provided by many of these correspondents decided me towrite a serious and COMPLETELY NON-FICTION sequel. Unfortunately, a chestcontaining the bulk of the letters was among the items which were mysteriouslyLOST IN TRANSIT some four years when I moved from London, England, to Sydney,Australia; before I moved on to settle in New Zealand.“For some time after Alternative 3 was originally published, I have reason tosuppose that my home telephone was being tapped and my contacts who wereexperienced in such matters were convinced that certain intelligence agenciesconsidered that I probably knew too much.“So, summing up, the book is FICTION BASED ON FACT. But I now feel that Iinadvertently got VERY CLOSE TO A SECRET TRUTH.”NONE DARE CALL IT ALTERNATIVE 3It is amazing to consider that Nikola Tesla, sometime in the 1920's first wrotein his personal journals his thoughts and fears concerning the buildup ofgreenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. These gases, caused by manmade andnatural pollutants were to eventually cause Earth’s overall temperature toincrease to such a point that the polar icecaps would melt, flooding thecoastlines. As well, weather patterns would change dramatically bringing aboutfierce storms, tornados, droughts in some areas and floods in others.Agriculture would be destroyed and life as we know it would cease to exist.So, while the name Alternative 3 may have been nothing more then the imaginationof a clever television writer…the basic premise, that the greenhouse effectcaused by air pollution would make human life on Earth extremely hazardous, isprobably correct. Even more incredible is the fact that Nikola Tesla allegedlyfirst came across this disturbing information while monitoring mysterious voiceson his specialized radio receiver.Tesla theorized that the planets developing pollution problems were beingclosely monitored by extraterrestrials who were studying Earth and itsinhabitants. Tesla was indecisive on whether or not these intelligences werehostile, friendly or indifferent. He had no clear-cut evidence that theinformation he had been receiving was factual; in fact, Tesla often wrote thatif it were not for the unusual way that he was getting this knowledge, he wouldhave dismissed it long ago as the ravings of a lunatic. Nevertheless, Tesla wasintrigued enough to devote most of his later years to research and inventionsbased on the voice transmissions he was receiving from his Martials.Some researchers have attributed Ronald Reagan’s Space Defense Initiative to abranch of Alternative 3. This special project was using a portion of its blackbudget to build a space based weapon system to be deployed not against Sovietnuclear missiles, but instead, to a perceived threat against hostileextraterrestrial forces.In Genesis Revisited, Zecharia Sitchin maintains that the world's leaders“...have been aware for some time, first, that there is one more planet in oursolar system and, second, that we are not alone.” He claims that only thisknowledge can explain the incredible changes in world affairs that have beentaking place with even more incredible speed.Certainly, both Reagan and Gorbachev have referred to threats fromextraterrestrials. Speaking at Fallston, Maryland, on December 4, 1985, Reaganstated,“Just think how easy his (Gorbachev's) task and mine might be in thesemeetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat to this world from someother species from another planet outside the universe. We'd forget all thelittle local differences that we have between our countries and we would findout once and for all that we are all human beings here on Earth together.”On February 16, 1987, at the Grand Kremlin Palace, Moscow, Gorbachev observed,“At our meeting in Geneva, the US President said that if the Earth faced aninvasion by extraterrestrials, the United States and the Soviet Union would joinforces to repel such an invasion. I shall not dispute the hypothesis, though Ithink it's early yet to worry about such an intrusion.”In an address to the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 21,1987, speaking of the need to turn swords into ploughshares, Reagan said, “Inour obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we often forget how much unitesall the members of humanity. Perhaps we need some outside, universal threat torecognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differenceswould vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.”The late UFO investigator Leonard Stringfield states in Timothy Good's The UFOReport: “Star Wars, ostensibly conceived as a defensive system against Russianmissile attacks, may have had from its beginning a ‘defensive’ UFO connection.”Documentary evidence of such an agenda appears to have been inadvertentlyprovided by NASA when the astronauts of the Shuttle Discovery transmitted toEarth, video camera footage of UFOs traversing just above Earth atmosphere. OneUFO suddenly makes a 90-degree turn to the right and accelerates off into deeperspace, just a second before a burst of shaped pulse high energy streaks up fromEarth towards the spot where the UFO would have been if it had not radicallychanged course. Other UFOs are shown being shot at by visibly energized EMweapon bursts.What is the motive for the undeclared war on extraterrestrials? RichardHoagland, former editor of Star & Sky magazine explains. “There is a great dealof naiveté about the forces in our society that do not want this knowledge, evenin the form of a very useful technology, to get out.” He notes that there are“interlocking institutions whose job it is to keep themselves in business, andthey do not take lightly to this ET technology. After all, how do people stay inpower? Because they define the universe as limited, rare and scarce and then puta price tag on it. Then some people are put in charge of doling out the scarceprecious thing; other people buy it at whatever the market will bear. And youhave a really neat system for controlling people.”It is possible that the United States government (and other foreign powers) wereaware of a hidden extraterrestrial presence over Earth. Tesla had confided to afew friends that he had sent a number of letters to Washington DC expressing hisfear of an invasion from outer space. Tesla had also offered Washington a numberof his inventions for the purpose of defending the planet against the allegedalien invaders.Tesla was financially troubled by this time and he offered the governmentcomplete access to his research, provided that he be paid a small, monthlystipend for the use of his inventions. Tesla received no answer to hisinquiries, no doubt due to the sensational nature of his letters. It was notuntil several years after his death that the United States military became awareof intrusions into the country’s airspace by what later would be known as UFOs.Tesla’s ideas of electric death rays and particle beam weapons, while scoffed atduring his lifetime, were now eagerly sought after by the military. Even thoughUFOs have been seen for centuries, it was not until the beginning of the 20thcentury that the numbers of reported encounters increased significantly. ThePentagon could think of no reason for the blatant way that UFOs were nowoperating except as a precursor to an invasion. The message was clear: “We cango and come as we please, and there is nothing that you can do about it.”Part of the rumors that surround Alternative 3 is the contention that the UnitedStates and Russia formed a secret partnership and constructed bases on the moonas a jumping off point for Mars. It can now be confirmed that these secret baseson the moon are real and still exist today.Unlike the fictional TV show Alternative 3, the real moon bases were notinstalled until after Apollo 11's historic landing in 1969. Before that time,primitive remote control spacecraft containing supplies and building materialhad been sent to wait for the time when astronauts would arrive and startconstruction.The remaining Apollo missions would rendezvous in orbit with containerspreviously sent up from Vandenburg Air Force Base in California. The Apollowould then ferry the containers to the moon to be placed in orbit for later use.SOMEONE ELSE IS ON THE MOON AND MARSThe Apollo moon missions served two functions, one as a public display of theUnited States’ ability to reach the moon, the other was delivery of men andmaterial to be used to construct the secret moon bases. The Apollo astronautswould not be responsible for building the first moon base, that honor would goto astronauts who would work in anonymity. Both the United States and the formerSoviet Union would participate in the construction of the moon colony.Astronauts would be sent into Earth orbit from Vandenburg and the Baikonur SpaceCenter. Upon reaching orbit, a ferry craft would then take them the rest of theway to the moon. The first moon base was finished in 1971 and the rest werecompleted by 1976.The moon has proved to be a virtual goldmine in minerals and even pockets of icehidden in the shadows of some craters. Another exciting resource on the moon isan ample supply of the isotope helium-3, which is very rare on Earth but hasbeen deposited on the lunar surface over billions of years by the solar wind. Itis estimated that at least a million tons of He-3 are readily recoverable fromthe regolith formations where lunar solar power stations would be practical.This He-3 offers a key to safe, practical nuclear fusion energy on the moon. Asingle ton of He-3 delivered to Earth would be worth at least $1 billion.The next step was to dispatch and establish robot probes to Mars, the ultimatedestination for this mission. The idea was to duplicate the successful mooncolonies on Mars, with an extremely long-term goal to terraform Mars into a morehospitable planet and the new home for humanity. Unfortunately, this mission andothers like it would all end in disaster.NASA is well aware that unusual anomalies on the surface of the moon have beenseen and photographed by astronomers. In the 1920s and 1930s, American, British,and French astronomers reported glowing, moving and sometimes even blinkinglights on the moon.This interest peaked when a respected expert in aerial phenomenon, PulitzerPrize winning astronomer John O'Neill, publicly reported observing what appearedto be an artificially constructed bridge on the moon. Many of the Gemini andApollo astronauts have admitted that they saw UFOs while they were in orbit.Astronaut Dr Edgar Mitchell, a veteran of the Apollo 14 moon mission, haspublicly stated that extraterrestrials have visited Earth on several occasions -but the alien contact has been repeatedly covered up by governments. DrMitchell, said during a radio interview that sources at NASA who had had contactwith aliens described the beings as “little people who look strange to us.”He said supposedly real-life ET's were similar to the traditional image of asmall frame, large eyes and head. Dr. Mitchell claimed our technology is “notnearly as sophisticated\" as theirs and \"had they been hostile”, he warned “wewould have been gone by now.”One Soviet space mission in the 1960s, designed to set a new record for time inorbit, was mysteriously aborted right after their craft entered space. Privateresearchers with powerful receiving radio equipment claimed the Sovietcosmonauts were followed into orbit by UFOs, which surrounded them and beganbouncing them back and forth as if they were playing a ball game with the Sovietcraft. The cosmonauts reportedly panicked and reentered the Earth’s atmosphereat the first available moment.During the 1960s, many UFOs were reportedly tracked back to the moon bygovernment tracking stations. Soviet and American spacecraft in orbit over themoon began to photograph mysterious structures on the moon which were censoredby NASA for a while, yet were obtained by scientific researchers like FredSteckling. Many of the structures can only be seen when these photos areblown-up to a much larger size.Further evidence of an extraterrestrial presence on the moon comes from an AirForce veteran with an Above Top Secret security clearance. Investigativereporter Alan Carmack, who was doing research for the TV show Strange World, wascontacted by the veteran who had an amazing story to tell. Former Air ForceSergeant Karl Wolfe worked for the Director of Intelligence at HeadquartersTactical Air Command, Technical Group. In 1965, Wolfe was stationed at LangleyField in Virginia. Langley was the hub of information gathered from the LunarOrbiter Project.Wolfe said that, “My Supervising Sergeant called me aside and informed me thatthere was a technical problem in a highly-classified area of Langley. At thattime, all systems were expanding to support increased military efforts for theViet Nam War. As a part of that, it was my job to support and maintain highlyclassified Intelligence and Reconnaissance related Electronic PhotographicSystems, recently installed in a new Top Secret facility on the Base. Our unitwas under the command of the Director of Intelligence at Headquarters SAC,Tactical Air Command, Langley Field, Virginia.“My Supervisor stated that the Lunar Orbiter program had encountered a problemwith an Electronic Photographic Contact Printer, identical to equipment that wasutilized in the darkrooms of our own Unit. This was the first Lunar Orbiterprogram, the purpose of which was to bring back the first close-up pictures ofthe surface of the moon. These photos would later be utilized to select anappropriate landing site for the first manned landing on the moon, in 1969.“As the only Electronics Repairman on the Base with a Cryptologic SecurityClearance, a step above Top Secret, I was being loaned to the project to see ifI could resolve the system problem. More than excited at the prospect of helpingout and possibly having a chance to view the first close up photos of thesurface of the moon, I was briefed on security, and gathered the appropriateequipment and tools for the task.“Driving across the Base on the perimeter access road that skirted the flatdusty fields and long runways in the distance, I noticed an experimentalhelicopter hovering fly-like in the air just above and to the south of themassive arching metal-grey hanger, one of the largest on the base that housedthe Lunar Orbiter project.“Upon entering the hanger, I was asked to present my Top Secret Identity Badge,in exchange for their internal higher-level Identity Badge; this was to be wornaround the neck on a chain. Another guard escorted me through a series ofsecurity doors to an expansive open area within the hanger.“Large black fabric curtains hung from a metal grid suspended from the ceiling.These, in effect, cordoned off various working areas within the larger space.Passing through one of the draped areas, I entered a large open space wherepeople in small groups stood talking quietly, with a sense of seriousness andconcern.“I was immediately struck by the number of people who were present, who appearedto be civilians, and also some scientists from other countries. With a bit ofinstant shock and judgment, I thought to my self, why are they here? I had avery strange feeling—a feeling that something is off here, something is notquite right.“I was introduced to a man dressed in civilian clothes and a lab coat, the headof the project, a Dr. Collie, I believe. In a very gracious and reserved manner,bringing to mind an image of Sherlock Holmes, he softly conveyed to me that theequipment in question was holding up the processing of the first close-upphotographs of the surface of the moon and also delaying the release of photosto be provided for study and release to the world, and how grateful the programstaff would be if there was anything that I could do.“An Airman escorted me into a darkroom. Inside, another young Airman assembledstrips of highresolution 35mm film into what is called a mosaic. He was placingside-by-side successively numbered photographic scans of the lunar surface,which had been transmitted back to earth from the Lunar Orbiter. Each surfacescan covered a narrow band of terrain, and successive orbits around the moonwere required to assemble a complete photographic image of the lunar terrain.“The mosaic negative created by that process was then placed into a ResolutionEnhancing Contact Printer. Photographic paper was placed on top of the negative,and an exposure begun. The negative was scanned by an electron light beamgenerated by a large Cathode Ray Tube, similar to the tube in a black and whitetelevision set.“The light beam was picked up by a photo-multiplier tube and, through a feedbackloop, modulated by the various changes in density of the photographic negative,enhancing the contrast, brightness and resolution of the image in the process.The resulting 9.5-inch by 18-inch high-resolution contact print was thenexamined by a photographic interpreter or scientist, who viewed the images undera microscopic type viewer, analyzing the features and terrain of the lunarlandscape.“Left alone in the faint red light of the darkroom with the Airman andequipment, much of which I had never seen before, I began to question thetechnician, attempting to discern what the problem might be with the ailingcontact printer. After a few minutes of investigation, it was clear that therewas a problem with the electronic control circuitry, which was comprised ofseveral small plug-in circuit modules.“Having no spare parts on hand, it was clear that I would have to trouble-shooteach module on a component-by-component basis, a very tedious and time consumingprocess at best. This was something that could not be done in the faint redlight of a darkroom. The unit would have to be removed from the darkroom andtaken into a more appropriate space to allow for the accomplishment of the task.“Talking with the Airman on the other side of the room, questions floated intomy head. I was curious and fascinated with the whole process. How were thesignals from the Lunar Orbiter transmitted to the lab? How where they convertedinto images on photographic film? How were the images correlated and alignedinto the final mosaic negative? I knew these were all questions that I shouldnot ask, in fact I could receive severe punishment for asking such questions.Yet, at the same time, I was alone with an Airman who was obviously asenthusiastic as I was about his job. I hesitated for a moment, weighing in mymind what I should do.“Under normal operating conditions, many other people would have been in thelab, part of the assembly line of production. But, here we were all alone, so Ibegan to ask all those questions.“After about thirty minutes of technical discussion and a complete rundown onall the steps in the process, the Airman turned to me and said candidly, ‘Youknow they've discovered a base on the back side of the moon.’ I said, ‘What doyou mean?’ Again, he said, ‘They have discovered a base on the moon!’ and,surreptitiously, at the same time dropped a photograph in front of me.“There it was; a mosaic print of the surface of the moon, with some sort ofgeometric structures clearly visible. Scrutinizing the image, I could seespheres and towers. My first thought was, ‘Whose base is it?’ Then I realizedthe full implication: it was not anyone of this earth.“I didn’t dwell on the photograph - I quickly took it in visually and moved awayin case someone else should enter the lab. I knew that I had been given a gift,information that I should not have seen. With my position being that of adutiful Airman, I asked no further questions and went about my business, quietlythinking to myself that I couldn't wait to hear about this on the news in thenext few days! I told myself, do whatever you can to get this thing fixed...sothe world can see this and hear about it!“Two days of labors paid off, a tiny diode on one of the circuit cards hadshorted. Replacing the defective component, I was as surprised as anyone that Ihad found the problem. Dr. Collie was more than pleased and offered several ofthe first photographs of the lunar surface to me in appreciation of my efforts.As he autographed some of the prints for me, I longed to ask more questionsabout the moon base, but knew that was forbidden, and that I would have to waitfor the evening news for the answers, along with the rest of the world.“Now, here it is more than thirty years later, and I am still waiting to hearthe report on the evening news of what was found on the back side of the moon.”It is believed that joint teams comprising mostly of scientists and techniciansfrom the United States and Russia operate the clandestine moon bases. There arealso teams from Great Britain, Canada, France and Australia. The men who operatethese secret bases are also well aware that they aren’t the only ones on themoon. There are also bases apparently maintained by ET’s that appear anddisappear so frequently that there is no way to investigate them. Thesestructures are located almost entirely on the opposite side of the moon.THE FAILURE OF ALTERNATIVE 3The main goal of the manned moon bases was to act as a jump point for missionsto Mars. These missions, using first robotic spacecraft and then astronauts,were to establish a human presence on Mars with the eventual purpose of buildingpermanent colonies.The thinking was that with Earth soon to become extremely inhospitable tocivilization, Mars would act as sort of a “foster” world for human civilizationto continue to flourish. It was hoped that Earth’s greenhouse effect wouldstabilize after about two thousand years, then the Martian colonies, with theirsuperior technology still intact, could move back to Earth and reestablish thepopulation.What the Alternative 3 planners did not considered was that there was already anintelligent presence on Mars that would not look very favorably upon interlopersfrom Earth.The earliest robot probes to Mars in the 1960's ran into little trouble with theexception of mechanical problems due to the primitive electronics used at thetime. The first craft to set down successfully on Mars in 1963 (Lowell III) sentback a few blurred photos showing that Mars had little atmosphere or water.Stories that now surround the Alternative 3 legend state that the secretspacecraft from the Pentagon landed on Mars in 1962 and sent back videotapedimages of the surface. The video allegedly showed a Martian landscape that hadcanals, lakes, green vegetation, swamps, and animal life on the surface. This isa good example of the disinformation that exists to hide the actual program thatthe TV program Alternative 3 was based on.After this initial success though, further surveys of Mars ran into mysteriousproblems that could not be attributed to mechanical failure. The same problemswere also being experienced by NASA and the Soviets who were unaware of theAlternative 3 efforts underway at the same time.What is still not clearly understood is why some Mars missions, like the VikingsI and II landings on Mars were successful, while others ended in disaster. Thefirst manned landing on Mars was scheduled for 1978, but it was halted when theship being constructed in orbit around the moon was mysteriously destroyed.Due to these unexplained failures, the Mars colonization project, which had adeadline of 1980 for its first phase, was pushed back to 1985 and finally to1990. The entire colonization mission to Mars was finally abandoned in 1992.CHAPTER NINE HAARP - CHEMTRAILS - ALTERNATIVE 4With the failure of Alternative 3, it became necessary to implement a new systemto protect humanity from the upcoming disaster from global warming. The MarsProjects had eaten away at the combined American and Soviet budgets forAlternative 3, and now world politics would interfere at the expense of itscitizens.President Ronald Reagan, who felt that destroying the “Evil Empire” was moreimportant than fighting global warming, earmarked the remaining money from theMars Projects for building new weapons to destroy the Soviet Union. The Sovietsprotested by withdrawing their cooperation for Alternative 3 and shortlythereafter collapsed as a world power. This marked the official demise ofAlternative 3.Earlier studies had estimated that the planet’s temperature would increase highenough to cause the melting of the ice caps by the year 2000. Efforts to cutback air pollution in the 1970's apparently slowed down the heating to a smalldegree. Enough to gain about twenty or thirty extra years before disasterstruck.Unfortunately, no one had foreseen the damage to the ozone layer caused byunlimited use of fluorocarbons. A massive “hole” in the ozone layer opened upover both poles causing huge amounts of cosmic radiation to flood the planet,further aggravating the existing problem. Something had to be done and donefast, or the planet would bake from solar radiations.It was clear that an outside intelligence had declared Mars “off limits” forhuman colonization. The reasons why could only be speculated, but Tesla had saidyears earlier that he thought Mars was inhabited both by people originally fromancient Earth and extraterrestrials from outside our solar system. He may havebeen right.With the budget slashed, and Russia no longer a partner, it was now mainly up tothe United States and their allies to come up with some kind of solution to theimpending threat. That solution came from secret papers and letters by Tesla.Perhaps in response to the anomalous radio signals he was receiving, Tesla wrotein June 1900, “The time is very near when we shall have the precipitation of themoisture of the atmosphere under complete control...” Tesla must have known atthis point what was in store for planet Earth in the near future.Tesla’s original warnings had also caught the interest of those hastily tryingto develop the successor to Alternative 3. Now that fleeing the planet is nolonger an option, those in power are stuck on Earth with the rest of humanity.The only viable method now seemed to be to try and modify the weather usingtechnology invented by Tesla years earlier.Tesla, heeding the strange voices he heard over his modified radio receiver,started experiments to see if it was possible to change the weather usingmassive amounts of electricity. There is a global circuit, sometimes referred toas the Wilson circuit, in which the ionosphere is maintained at a positivepotential, generally in the range 200 to 300 kilovolts, relative to the earth.In the non-thunderstorm (fair-weather) portions of the atmosphere, a returnconduction current flows between the ionosphere and the earth, and the circuitis completed between the conducting earth and the bases of thunderclouds througha combination of conduction, convection, lightning, point discharge andprecipitation currents. The charge, put on the earth by thunderstorms, maintainsthe earth's electric field and the ionospheric potential.Tesla originally discovered this natural global circuit in the 1890s and he onceagain took up research on the subject after he became convinced that the warmingof the planet was being helped along by extraterrestrial forces.The Tesla system involves using giant magnifying transmitters to act as globalgenerators and artificially create the same global electromagnetic circuitfunctions that are naturally created by thunderstorm activity. Oddly enough, thefirst use of Tesla’s idea came from the good old days of the Cold War and theSoviets experiments with weather modification.On the Fourth of July, 1976, the former Soviet Union began broadcasting pulsedelectromagnetic fields from three gigantic 40-million watt transmitters thatbeamed those signals halfway around the world to the U.S. This electronicassault disrupted and jammed radio and television broadcast signals, enraged theFCC, and irritated ham radio operators, who quickly dubbed the signals “TheRussian Woodpecker,” because of their pulsed cadence. Originally designed tobring more rain to certain areas of Siberia, the Soviets were surprised to findthat the signals also disrupted weather over North America.The Russians completed nearly 30 of the huge transmitters that emit signalsprimarily in the very dangerous 10-Hertz range, otherwise known as Extreme LowFrequency (ELF). The technology was rumored to be based on the work of Tesla.These Tesla transmitters create massive “standing” ELF waves that form majorhigh pressure blocking systems that change the normal high altitude jet streampattern, force it to the north, and actually retard the normal flow patterns ofincoming weather systems.As far back as April, 1969, Spectrum, a publication of the prestigious Instituteof Electrical and Electronics Engineers, featured an article by Seymour Tilsonwhich stated, “Workers in the field of atmospheric electricity and cloud physicshave accumulated sufficient evidence to suggest that electric fields in theEarth’s lower atmosphere play a critical role...perhaps the critical role...inthe development and behavior of clouds that produces precipitation.”Tilson may have been on to something, exactly one year after the start of theRussian Woodpecker, July 4 1978; the U.S. Government conducted its own ELFweather experiment that created an enormous downpour of rain over six countiesof northern Wisconsin. This ELF-generated storm generated winds of 157 mphdestroying several thousand acres of forest and leveling the town of Phillips,Wisconsin. The estimated damage was in excess of $50 million dollars.The first published alarm about Soviet weather control warfare came from Dr.Andrew Michrowski of PACE (Planetary Association for Clean Energy). In apublished paper in 1978, Dr. Michrowski described how he had placed monitoringstations all across Canada and determined that “the Soviets managed to establishrelatively stable and localized ELF fields (over North America) which were ableto hamper or divert the jet stream flow in the Northern Hemisphere.”Several years later, Michrowski stated in a PACE Newsletter (Vol.4, #4): “ELFfields...propagate vertically to the ground, creating ‘standing waves’...thatcan redistribute energy and momentum in (atmosphere) through cumulus convection.It has been consistently noted that variance of the (Soviet) ELF transmissionsleads to a subsequent change in the route of the jet stream flow in the NorthernHemisphere within 72 hours.”The 2/81 PACE Newsletter reported that the Soviets turned off their ELFWoodpecker signal for a brief period in 1980: “During the two-week lull, theNorthern Hemisphere's jet stream was normal…with the return of the Soviet ELFtransmissions, the jet stream was deflected (again) by a persistent (high)pressure ridge extending from the Yukon to Arizona.”Spurned on by the success of the Russian Woodpecker signal, the United Statessecretly activated the High Active Auroral Research Project, or HAARP. Locatedin Gakon, Alaska, this Tesla-based U.S. Navy and Air Force ionospheric heaterhas been projecting tightly-focused beams of intense radio-frequency energy intothe atmosphere for the past several years.This controllable radio wave is so powerful and electromagnetically charged thatit can actually lift and heat the ionosphere. Put simply, the apparatus forHAARP is a reversal of a radio telescope; the antennas send out signals insteadof receiving.HAARP publicity states that the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Programis mainly an academic project with the goal of changing the ionosphere toimprove communications for our own good. However, other U.S. military documentsput it more clearly; HAARP aims to learn how to “exploit the ionosphere forDepartment of Defense purposes.”The patents described below were the package of ideas that were originallycontrolled by ARCO Power Technologies Incorporated (APTI), a subsidiary ofAtlantic Richfield Company. APTI was the contractor that built the HAARPfacility. ARCO sold this subsidiary, the patents and the second phaseconstruction contract to E-Systems in June 1994.E-Systems is one of the biggest intelligence contractors in the world, doingwork for the CIA, defense intelligence organizations and others. $1.8 billion oftheir annual sales are to these organizations, with $800 million for BlackProjects.E-Systems was bought out by Raytheon, which is one of the largest defensecontractors in the world. In 1994 Raytheon was listed as number forty-two on theFortune 500 list of companies. Raytheon has thousands of patents, some of whichwill be valuable in the HAARP project. The twelve original patents are thebackbone of the HAARP project, and are now buried among the thousands of othersheld in the name of Raytheon. Bernard J. Eastlund's U.S. Patent # 4,686,605,“Method and Apparatus for Altering a Region in the Earth's Atmosphere,Ionosphere; and/or Magnetosphere,” was sealed for a year under a governmentSecrecy Order.The Eastlund ionospheric heater was different; the radio frequency (RF)radiation was concentrated and focused to a point in the ionosphere. Thisdifference throws an unprecedented amount of energy into the ionosphere.The Eastlund device would allow a concentration of one watt per cubiccentimeter, compared to others only able to deliver about one millionth of onewatt. This huge difference could lift and change the ionosphere in the waysnecessary to create futuristic effects described in the patent. According to thepatent, the work of Nikola Tesla in the early 1900's formed the basis of theresearch.What would this technology be worth to ARCO, the owner of the patents? Theycould make enormous profits by beaming electrical power from a powerhouse in thegas fields to the consumer without wires.For a time, HAARP researchers could not prove that this was one of the intendeduses for HAARP. In April 1995, however, other patents were found connected witha “key personnel” list for APTI.Some of these new APTI patents were indeed a wireless system for sendingelectrical power. Eastlund’s patent said the technology could confuse orcompletely disrupt airplanes' and missiles'sophisticated guidance systems. Further, this ability to spray large areas ofEarth with electromagneticwaves of varying frequencies, and to control changes in those waves, makes itpossible to knock outcommunications on land or sea as well as in the air.The patent continues with, “Thus, this invention provides the ability to putunprecedented amountsof power in the Earth's atmosphere at strategic locations and to maintain thepower injection levelparticularly if random pulsing is employed, in a manner far more precise andbetter controlled thanheretofore accomplished by the prior art, particularly by detonation of nucleardevices of variousyields at various altitudes. It is possible not only to interfere with thirdparty communications but alsoto take advantage of one or more such beams to carry out a communicationsnetwork even though therest of the world's communications are disrupted. Put another way, what is usedto disrupt another'scommunications can be employed by one knowledgeable of this invention as acommunicationnetwork at the same time. Large regions of the atmosphere could be lifted to anunexpectedly highaltitude so that missiles encounter unexpected and unplanned drag forces withresultant destruction.Weather modification is possible by, for example, altering upper atmosphere windpatterns byconstructing one or more plumes of atmospheric particles which will act as alens or focusing device.Molecular modifications of the atmosphere can take place so that positiveenvironmental effects canbe achieved. Besides actually changing the molecular composition of anatmospheric region, aparticular molecule or molecules can be chosen for increased presence.”Eastlund also notes NATOs interest in modifying the weather for militaryadvantage. In May 1990 aNATO paper: Modification of Tropospheric Propagation Conditions, detailed howthe atmospherecould be modified to absorb electromagnetic radiation by spraying polymersbehind high-flyingaircraft.Absorbing microwaves transmitted by HAARP and other atmospheric heaters linkedfrom PuertoRico, Germany and Russia, these artificial mirrors could heat the air, inducingchanges in the weather.U.S. Patent # 4253190 describes how a mirror made of “polyester resin” could beheld aloft by thepressure exerted by electromagnetic radiation from a transmitter like HAARP.A PhD polymer researcher who wishes to remain anonymous told researcher WilliamThomas thatif HAARP’s frequency output is matched to Earth’s magnetic field, itstightly-beamed energy could beimparted to molecules “artificially introduced into this region. This highlyreactive state could thenpromote polymerization and the formation of new compounds.”Adding magnetic iron oxide powder to polymers exuded by many high-flyingaircraft can foster theheat generation needed to modify the weather. Radio-frequency-absorbing polymerssuch as PhillipsRyton F-5 PPS are sensitive in the 1-50 MHz regime, HAARP transmits between twoand 10 MHz. HAARP’s U.S. Air Force and Navy sponsors claim that theirtransmitter will eventually be ableto produce 3.6 million watts of radio frequency power. But on page 185 of anOctober 1991“Technical Memorandum 195” outlining projected HAARP tests, there is a call bythe ionosphericeffects division of the U.S. Air Force Phillips Laboratory for HAARP to reach apeak power output of100 billion watts. Commercial radio stations commonly broadcast at 50,000 watts.Some hysterical reports state that HAARP-type technologies will be used toinitiate weathermanipulation, climate modification, polar ice-cap melting, ozone depletion,earthquake engineeringand ocean wave control through deliberate undertakings that alter and distortour planet's delicateelectromagnetic energy fields. However, instead of using this technology todestroy mankind, it nowis clear that HAARP is being used to modify the weather to stop, or at leastlessen, the effects of globalwarming in order to save mankind. Alternative 4–the successor to Alternative 3is now operational. There is another factor now operating in conjunction withHAARP that has caught the attention ofconspiracy writers around the world, the mystery of the “Chemtrails.”THE MYSTERY OF THE CHEMTRAILSWe are all familiar with contrails, the exhaust left in the atmosphere byhigh-flying jet planes. Since 1997, observers all over the world have noticed anincrease in these contrails with the skies being covered by a grid-pattern ofhigh - altitude trails left by jets.Active duty military personnel, police officers, pilots and defense specialists,as well as hundreds of everyday Americans quite used to seeing aircraftcontrails and normal flight operations near cities, airports or overlong-established routes, independently confirm the presence of multiple “linesin the sky” being purposefully laid by large jet tankers (usually white in colorand always without identifying markings) over cities and rural areas.As many as 20, 30 or more “contrails” are woven over hours into lattice-likegrid patterns. “Tic-tac-toe in the sky” or “furrowing a farm field” areexpressions commonly used to describe these multiple-aircraft maneuvers, inwhich white contrail-like emissions linger for hours, gradually spreading into ahazy overcast that completely obscures clear blue skies.Normal contrails form when ice-crystals are disturbed by the passage of anairplane at high (cold) altitudes. Streaming from engines and wingtips,pencil-thin contrails almost always disappear within 45 seconds, fading quicklylike the wake behind a boat.While ice-crystal contrails can occasionally persist for hours, formingcirrus-type clouds that drift over a large area - particularly over high-trafficroutes such as the Atlantic corridor between the USA and Europe – the chemtrailsbeing reported daily by many independent eye-witnesses always linger for hours,forming an overcast from which veils of wispy fallout are often observed.In some cases, commercial jetliners flying across these persistent grid-patternslay normal contrails that disappear quickly alongside lingering chemtrails.Usually laid in an east-west direction, with characteristic X’s and criss-crosstrails also often observed, jets layering these deliberate chemtrails have oftenbeen observed switching their emissions off as they approach mountains or othergeographically delineating features, only to turn their spray back on aftermaking their turns back over the area being sprayed.There has also been increased incidents of acute respiratory illness, includingbronchitis, pneumonia and first-time asthma attacks in what doctors are callingepidemic levels across the USA and Great Britain. Fatalities, mostly among theelderly and immune-compromised, have exceeded 8,100 dead in England in the lastweek of December and first two weeks of January 1999 according to the BBC.Other observers report spraying from black, unmarked helicopters andtwin-turboprop aircraft flying at rooftop level, often, but not always at night.Incidents of chemicals being dumped from unmarked helicopters into municipalreservoirs have also been reported.While chemtrail sightings have attracted strident attacks for lack of proof,videotape clearly shows billowing white spray being emitted from the tails ofjets with wing-mounted engines, as well as from the wing sections outboard ofthe engines and inboard of the wingtips. These are the precise locations ofwing- and tail-mounted refueling probes on tanker aircraft.THE SPRAYING OF AMERICA – A BRIEF HISTORYIn the closing months of World War II, a small task force of U. S. Naval shipsmaneuvered off the coast of southern California. Their objective was to gaininformation that military officers hoped would save thousands of American lives.Instead, this little excursion cost a few hundred innocent lives in the name ofnational security. The expedition was the result of a fear among both Army andNavy officers that a super-secret Japanese military unit might be preparing todouse the West Coast with deadly bacteria. Ostensibly, a Japanese army “waterpurification” section situated in Pingfan, Manchuria, the group known as Unit731, actually was using prisoners, including Americans, as human guinea pigs inan effort to develop deadly toxins to destroy Japan’s enemies.In late 1941, the Japanese experimented with germ warfare by airdroppingplague-infested materials over Changde, in China’s Hunan Province. Later in thewar, they began experimenting with large balloons, capable of carrying anincendiary bomb across the Pacific, by harnessing upper wind currents. Theballoons were designed to fall on America, where the loss of gas brought them toEarth. By March 1945, more than 100 such balloons were known to have made theirway to America through the jet stream.The balloons landed as far north as White Horse, Alaska, and as far east asGrand Rapids, Michigan. In Oregon, six fishermen were killed when anincendiary-laden balloon exploded as they inspected it. Due to military secrecy,no one was warned of the balloon danger.Military authorities feared that the worse was yet to come. They worried aboutthe possibility of Unit 731 deploying balloons to release plague or encephalitisgerms over America. Such concern led to high-level meetings in March 1945.Military authorities realized that a disaster could be caused by even oneballoon releasing deadly biological agents.What these officers needed to know was how fast and in which direction suchdiseases might travel the so-called “vector” of the contagion. Navy ships weredispatched to steam along the coast of southern California, where, utilizing anearly-morning mist as cover, sailors opened pressurized tanks filled withinfluenza virus. The contagion drifted ashore where other military men keptclose tabs on both the speed and direction of infection.Hospitals were monitored as far inland as 250 miles. More than 200 persons diedin this flu outbreak, but the U. S. military got the information they wanted.Luckily, the war ended before Japan could use their high-flying balloons todeliver deadly toxins to America. However, U.S. government-led testing on itsown civilian population continued well into the 1950s.The army reportedly released simulant agents over hundreds of populated areasaround the country. Targets included portions of Hawaii and Alaska, SanFrancisco, St. Louis, Minneapolis, New York City, Washington, D.C., Key West,Fort Wayne, Indiana and many other cities. The purpose was to see how thebacteria spread and survived as people went about their normal activities. Noone learned of this secret experimentation for years because of top secret“national security.”In fact, during 45 years of open air testing, from time to time the army hasstopped using certain simulants for reasons of safety. In each instance, thearmy belatedly recognized they could be causing disease and death, although suchinformation had long been available in the medical literature. This was the casein the 1950s when it ceased using the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The fungushad long been known to cause aspergillosis, a disease that can be fatal.Similarly, in the 1960s the army stopped using zinc cadmium sulfide, a chemicalthat had been known for years to cause cancer.In the 1970s, the bacterium Serratia marcescens, a source of infections that canlead to death, was taken out of service as a simulant. In the 1980s, dimethylmethylphosphonate, a chemical known as DPP, was removed from use as a simulantbecause of its carcinogenic and other toxic potential.Simulants in use today continue to pose major health risks. The chemicalethylene oxide, which is present in some of the mixtures used in outdoorspraying, is a known carcinogen. The bacterium Bacillus subtilis, while notgenerally seen as dangerous, is cited in medical textbooks as able to causeserious infections. Microorganisms that seem harmless under some circumstancesmay cause illness under others.Exposure to high concentrations of any microorganism can be critically dangerousto people in weakened conditions. The elderly, the very young, people with AIDSand others who have weakened immune systems are more susceptible to lifethreatening infections. Nevertheless, the army has not monitored the health ofcitizens who may have been exposed during its tests while maintaining that itsbacterial agents cause no harm.There could be two things that are going on with the chemtrails: Weathermodification involving dangerous chemicals, and biowarfare experiments involvinglab-produced pathogens. It could very well be that the characteristic X’s in thesky are read by satellite to track dispersal patterns.Weather is all about heat exchange. Heat generation can be artificially inducedin the atmosphere by adding magnetic iron oxide powder to the polymer and thenheating it with HAARP or a more localized source. Bernard Eastlund, HAARP’sinventor and original patent-holder, has said that this is theoreticallypossible - and that polymer additives for microwave absorption are commerciallyavailable.Subsequent analysis by a private lab determined that some chemtrails contained a“strange iron like substance.” Chemtrail investigator Tommy Farmer comments thatthe chemist he engaged to examine an “angel hair” sample under a powerfulmicroscope “noticed manmade yellow orange orbs impregnated into the filaments ofthe material.” Farmer now believes this material could have been “oxidizingferrous alloy” used in weather modification experiments.Weather modification using chemtrails and other methods may be taking placeacross America without the help of HAARP, which according to Dr. Nick Begich(co-author of Angels Don’t Play This HAARP) is apparently being activated onlyfor short periods a few times a year.A specialist who spoke under conditions of anonymity says that “if HAARP hasanything to do with the contrails, I now realize we are talking about analtitude in the range of 10 Km. I don't know if it is possible to create [aresonance] region so close to the ground. None of the patents I have ever lookedat is claiming anything less than 50 km. Furthermore, at the 10 Km height, it ishard to see how HAARP would have anything to do with effects seen in the lower48 states or anywhere else on the planet.”When this engineer looked at other military applications for spraying organicelectrolytes into the atmosphere, his patent searches turned up a radar-jammingspray and attempts to achieve over-the-horizon communications by reflectingradio waves off sprayed aerosols. He noted, “I could see that forover-the-horizon communications, one might make a reflector out of a gridpattern or parallel lines.”However, another weather modification expert insists that just as in shortwaveradio, it is possible to use the ionosphere to “skip” HAARP radio-frequencytransmissions to any region of the United States. Uncovered documents show thatthe Pentagon is also extremely interested in “steering storm systems” forweather modification, and in using sprayed aerosols to obscure the sky.Chemtrail researcher Will Thomas agrees that the spraying seems to be forweather modification and/or neutralizing global warming effects. He furtherpurports that this weather modification is being conducted due to pressure frominsurance companies who see financial ruin on their horizon with continued highdisaster-related claims. What is the downside of this? These weathermodification tactics are further depleting the ozone hole and enhancing globalwarming. It is a short-term, “band-aid” answer with even worse consequences.Spraying is generally done by certain planes: KC-10A, KC-135 (707) and C-130 forthe high altitude spraying and C-130 turboprop aircraft for the low-levelspraying. The KC-10A is a three-engine aircraft and would normally leave threeparallel contrails in its wake.The KC-135 is a smaller, four-engine aircraft that would typically display fourparallel contrail lines. When used during chemtrail missions; however, theseaircraft lay down only a single, thick, billowy chemtrail while simultaneouslydisplaying no normal contrails. There are other planes that have been used inthe spraying, but these are the main ones. Two types of spraying are done: highaltitude meaning 20,000 feet and above and low altitude spraying.THE COMPOSITION OF CHEMTRAILSPart of the substances in the chemtrails has been identified: a cocktail ofJP8+100 jet fuel, laced with Ethylene Dibromide (EDB). This chemical pesticidewas banned in 1983 by the EPA as a definite carcinogen and chemical toxin.Exposure to this type spraying can include these symptoms: respiratory tractproblems, severe infections to the throat and sinuses, swelling of the lymphglands, coughing fits, shortness of breath, sinus headaches, general respiratoryfailure, damage to the heart and liver, exposure to EDB makes people moresusceptible to other biological agents due to severe lung irritation.For lack of a better term, “brown goo” has been used to describe the materialfound on exterior walls of buildings and windshields of automobiles. It isalmost impossible to remove with soap and water, and has proved to be highlytoxic to anyone who has come in contact with it.Numerous red and white blood cells, and unidentified cell types have been foundwithin the sub-micron fiber sample previously presented and submitted by CarolM. Browner, Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.The cells appear to be of a freeze-dried or desiccated nature in their originalform within the microscopic fibers. It has also been reported that sprayingsamples have been analyzed and have revealed that many deadly and toxicpathogens have been found including Mycoplasma Fermetens Incognitus. This is thesame bioengineered pathogen that Dr. Garth Nicholson discovered in about 45% ofthe veterans who came down with Gulf War Illness.Based on their published agenda, it is known that the US Air Force is currentlyengaged in extensive weather modification and control techniques in cooperationwith Alternative 4. The Air Force also admits to “routine fuel dumping” ofhighly toxic JP8, and to using carbon black for weather modification. Accordingto a recent NASA cloud study, carbon black is a “very effective” nucleus aroundwhich water vapor can condense, forming an artificially induced cloud cover.Tommy Farmer, a former engineering technician with Raytheon Missile Systems, hasbeen tracking patterns of jet contrails phenomena for more than a year. Farmerhas “positively identified” two of the aircraft most often involved in theaerial spraying incidents as a Boeing KC-135 and Boeing KC-10; both big jets areused by the U.S. Air Force for air to air refueling.Confirming reports from eye-witnesses across the United States, Farmer reportsthat all aircraft are painted either solid white or solid black with theexception of two KC-135s that are in training colors—orange and white. Noidentifying markings are visible.Farmer has collected samples of what he calls “angel hair” sprayed by themystery aircraft on six occasions since February 1998. Four samples have beentaken since November 1998. Farmer says that globular filaments resemblingordinary spider webs, “usually fall in clumps or wads ranging from pencil erasersize to the size of a balled up fist.”Winds often whip the cobweb-like material into filaments as long as 50 feet.Farmer says that the sticky substance “melts in your hands” and adheres towhatever it touches. He also urges caution to collectors after becoming illafter his first contact with the angel hair. Farmer's ensuing sore throat andsinus infection lasted several months.After repeatedly observing aircraft spraying particulates in front of and intocloud systems, Farmer is fairly certain the contrail phenomena is one part of amilitary weather modification system, possibly to slow down global warming. Henotes that because the chemical contrails allow much more moisture to forminside cloud systems, severe localized storms result from the aerial seedingwhile surrounding areas that have surrendered their moisture to the storm cellsexperience drought.In a U.S. Air Force research study, Weather As A Force Multiplier, issued inAugust, 1996, seven U.S. military officers outlined how HAARP and aerialcloud-seeding from tankers could allow U.S. Aerospace forces to “own theweather” by the year 2025. Among the desired objectives were “StormEnhancement,” “Storm Modification” and “Induce Drought.”According to the Air Force report, “In the United States, weather-modificationwill likely become a part of national security policy with both domestic andinternational applications.”Within 30 years, the Air Force foresees using Weather Force Support Elementswith “the necessary sensor and communication capabilities to observe, detect,and act on weather-modification requirements to support U.S. military objectivesby “using airborne cloud generation and seeding” techniques being developedtoday. Other routine weather-modification missions will deploy “cirrus shields”formed by the chemical contrails of high-flying aircraft.In 1966 Lyden, F.J. and Shipman, G.A. published their Public Policy Issuesraised by weather modification; possible alternative strategies for governmentaction: in Sewell, W.R.D., ed., Human Dimensions of Weather Modification,University of Chicago, Dept. of Geography, Research Paper # 105, pp. 289-303:“Is weather modification a public function, analogous to military protection,postal service, or highway construction? Or, is it a private, non-governmentalfunction? If the latter, is it a private function vested with a public interest,as had been determined to be the case, for example, in rail or airtransportation. Or is weather modification an ordinary, lawful business, subjectonly to reasonable regulation, as in the manufacture and sale of clothing? Thisview raises questions about property rights, i.e., who owns the clouds?”As British scientist W. J Maunder commented in his book, The Value Of TheWeather (London: Methuen & Co. Ltd, 1970), “At least in the United Statesweather modification as a public function does not simplify matters, for aconsiderable amount of private capital has already been invested in cloudseeding enterprises, and any proposal of a governmental monopoly wouldundoubtedly meet with strong opposition from such investors. Even if theseobjections could be overcome, additional questions arise, such as should theprogram be a Federal governmental operation, or one administered by the stateswith co-ordination, and perhaps partial financing, by the Federal government.”It is also possible that the government is trying to vaccinate its citizenryagainst Anthrax, Tularemia, Brucellosis, or all three. Currently anthrax isprobably the greatest national threat currently facing our country as well asother countries. It is easy to manufacture, transport and deliver, and deathfollows quickly. The economic devastation projected from an anthrax attack issignificant.The technology exists for this type of DNA vaccine. People’s symptomsexperienced after a chemtrail spraying are consistent with symptoms one wouldsee produced by agents associated with the host bacteria used to deliver thevaccine. However, until a sample group of people is actually tested for immunityto anthrax, there is no proof that it protects conclusively against anthrax.Besides its obvious tactical military applications, aerial-seeding ofcontrail-clouds aligned in HAARP's characteristic grid-patterns could be part ofa secret U.S. government initiative (Alternative 4) to address the globalweather crisis brought about by atmospheric warming. This Tesla-based technologyunfortunately is only a temporary fix to the worldwide warming problem.PROJECT CLOVERLEAFChemtrail researcher C.E. Carnicom received a letter in May 2000 from an airlinemanager who said that he had important information concerning the chemtrails.The manager stated that he works for an undisclosed airline in upper management.In this letter, it was revealed that since 1998, airline companies in Americahave been participating in something called Project Cloverleaf.“The few airline employees who were briefed on Project Cloverleaf were all madeto undergo background checks, and before we were briefed on it we were made tosign non-disclosure agreements, which basically state that if we tell anyonewhat we know we could be imprisoned.“About twenty employees in our office were briefed along with me by twoofficials from some government agency. They didn't tell us which one. They toldus that the government was going to pay our airline, along with others, torelease special chemicals from commercial aircraft.“When asked what the chemicals were and why we were going to spray them, theytold us that information was given on a need-to-know basis and we weren'tcleared for it. They then went on to state that the chemicals were harmless, butthe program was of such importance that it needed to be done at all costs.“When we asked them why they didn’t just rig military aircraft to spray thesechemicals, they stated that there weren't enough military aircraft available torelease chemicals on such a large basis as needs to be done. That's why ProjectCloverleaf was initiated, to allow commercial airlines to assist in releasingthese chemicals into the atmosphere. Then someone asked why all the secrecy wasneeded.“The government reps then stated that if the general public knew that theaircraft they were flying on was releasing chemicals into the air,environmentalist groups would raise hell and demand the spraying stop. Someoneasked one of the G-men then if the chemicals are harmless, why not tell thepublic what the chemicals are and why we are spraying them?“He seemed perturbed at this question and told us in a tone of authority thatthe public doesn't need to know what's going on, but that this program is intheir best interests. He also stated that we should not tell anyone, nor ask anymore questions about it. With that, the briefing was over.“All documents in our office pertaining to Project Cloverleaf are kept in lockedsafes. Nobody is allowed to take these documents out of the office. Very fewemployees are allowed access to these documents, and they remain tight-lippedabout what the documents say.“Mr. Carnicom, I am no fool. I know there's something going on. And frankly, Iam scared. I feel a high level of guilt that I have been aware of this kind ofoperation but unable to tell anyone. It's been eating away at me, knowing thatthe company I work for may be poisoning the American people.”THE GOVERNMENTS ASSESSMENT OF DEVASTATING CLIMATIC CHANGESA coalition of U.S. government agencies unveiled in June 2000 the first nationalassessment on the potential consequences of climate change over the next 100years, revealing a wide range of impacts if the Earth continues to warmsignificantly. Cold winters in the Northeast could become a thing of the past,alleviating some health stresses, the nation's food supply should be safe, andforests may proliferate.However, at the same time, there will be drought concerns in every region of theUnited States, maple syrup will not flow easily in New England, and ecosystemsmay disappear entirely. Sources with environmental organizations who helpeddraft the assessment said the project offers a slew of scenarios for how theUnited States will be affected by a projected temperature rise of 5-10 degreesFahrenheit by the year 2100.Dr. Janine Bloomfield, an expert with the Environmental Defense organization inNew York City, said the report is not final and will be open for public comment.“There are specifics on the impact on ecosystems, as well as the rate andmagnitude of climate change,” Bloomfield said.The assessment breaks down how regions and specific sectors could be hurt orhelped if the Earth warms at the same rate it has in recent years due to theaccumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It was written by a panel ofscientists from several government agencies, academics, private groups, andother interested people ranging from farmers to fishermen.According to the draft, the country must be prepared for the changes ahead, evenif the exact impacts remain uncertain at this point. “It is very likely thatsome aspects and impacts of climate change will be totally unanticipated ascomplex systems respond to ongoing climate change in unforeseeable ways.”Even if steps were taken in the near-term to reduce human greenhouse gasemissions, the report says, the level of gases already in the atmosphere willleave the world susceptible to climate change for the next century. “Even if theworld takes mitigation measures, we must still adapt to a changing climate,” thedraft reports. “Similarly, even if we take adaptation measures, future emissionswill have to be curbed to stabilize climate. Neither type of response cancompletely supplant the other.”An international attempt to tackle climate change, the Kyoto Protocol, has notbeen finished but it aims to reduce sharply the amount of fossil-fuel emissionsfrom major industrial nations to 1990 levels by the year’s 2010-2012.The following are some of the key findings listed in the assessment draft.# Increased warming. Assuming continued growth in world greenhouse gasemissions, the climate models used in the assessment project that temperaturesin the United States will rise 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit on average in the next100 years.# Differing regional impacts. Climate change will vary widely across the UnitedStates. Heavy and extreme precipitation events are likely to become morefrequent, yet some regions will get drier.# Vulnerable ecosystems. A few ecosystems such as alpine meadows in the RockyMountains and some barrier islands are likely to disappear entirely, whileothers such as forests in the Southeast are likely to experience major speciesshift or breakup. The goods and services lost through the disappearance orfragmentation of certain ecosystems are likely to be costly or impossible toreplace.# Widespread water concerns. Drought is an important concern in every region.Floods and water quality are also concerns. Snow pack changes are especiallyimportant in the West, Pacific Northwest and Alaska.# Secure food supply. U.S. crop productivity is very likely to increase over thenext few decades, but the gains will not be uniform across the nation. Fallingprices and competitive pressures are very likely to stress some farmers.# Forest productivity is likely to increase in some areas as trees respond tohigher carbon dioxide levels. Climate change will also cause long-term shifts inforest species, such as sugar maples moving north out of the country.The southeastern states could experience rising sea levels and more frequentstorm surges threatening coastal development. Some coastal wetlands, barrierislands and beaches will disappear. The variety of tree species will increase,but grassland and savannas will displace many forests. There could be anincrease in water quality problems.The northeastern states may see more warming that will ease winter weatherextremes, but bring more rain and possible flooding. Warming may exacerbatepollution from agricultural runoff in places like the Chesapeake Bay. Hottersummers are likely, with more frequent and intense heat waves especiallyaffecting cities. Forest species shift northward and maple trees may disappear.Some coastal urban centers may have to rework sewer, water and transportationsystems because of sea level rise. Mountain regions will see a decline in skiingand increase in other activities such as hiking.The great lakes states will experience a decline in water levels because ofincreased evaporation, leading to reduced water supply. Shoreline damage islikely to decrease, but lower water levels add to marine transportationproblems. Cities along lakes must adapt to new water levels.The Midwestern-great plains states may see increased stress in major citiesbecause of extreme summer heat, but winters will become milder, reducingwinter-related illnesses and deaths. Longer growing season and increases incarbon dioxide will cause higher crop yields and allow planting of more types ofcrops and in many cases more than one crop a year.Despite higher rainfall, warmer weather will increase evaporation, reducing lakeand river water levels and a likelihood of more droughts and flash flooding.Farming on marginal land will become more difficult. Western and Mountain Statescould see warmer winter temperatures that will reduce snow accumulations inmountains, reducing summer runoff and complicating water management, floodcontrol and irrigation. Higher elevation ecosystems will shift with parts of themountain region becoming drier. Alpine meadows in the Rocky Mountains are likelyto face extreme stress and may disappear.Southwestern states could face increased moisture that will result in a declineof desert ecosystems, while shrub lands expand. Increase in crop diversity.Areas may have a variation of wet and dry periods adding to flooding and firerisks. Some birds and mammals may shift to higher elevations, while reptiles andamphibians may move to lower elevations with warming. Changes in mountain snowpack will require changes in water management.Warmer water temperatures may cause some fish species, including PacificNorthwest salmon, to migrate northward in the northwestern states and Alaska.Warmer water species may move into the Northwest. Warmer weather is likely toincrease rainfall in the summer and cause changes in species mix. Sea level risewill impact low-lying areas, especially in the Puget Sound area. Warming inAlaska will increase permafrost thawing, resulting in damage to roads, buildingsand impacting forests.Islands all over the planet will have to face rising sea levels and increasedpossibility of storms. This may reduce availability of fresh water and in somecases pose health risks. Higher water temperatures and increased carbon dioxidelevels are likely to exacerbate coral bleaching and increase destruction ofcoral reefs off southern Florida and Hawaii Islands.Science and environmental groups lauded the draft as a “balanced assessment” ofthe potential impacts of climate variability and change on the United States butwarned that unless the nation saw the report as a wake up call, nothing goodwould come from its release. In a joint statement from Environmental Defense,National Environmental Trust, Natural Resources Defense Council, Union ofConcerned Scientists and the World Wildlife Fund, the groups said it was time totake climate change seriously.A top-secret government report that will not be released to the public, confirmsthe climate assessment report, but adds that due to the difficulties of findinga worldwide solution to increased air pollution, global warming will continue toincrease beyond the five to ten degrees postulated by current analysis. Thereport continues with an estimate that the planet’s temperature will likelyincrease twenty to thirty degrees within one hundred years, making human lifeimpossible.Authors Note: This book was originally published in 2000, with the initialresearch conducted in 1998 through 2000. In the years since publication, climatechange has become an unfortunate reality and many of the early predictions haveproved to be accurate. In fact, it appears that many climate models conducted inthe late 1990’s were too conservative on such factors such as how rapid overallglobal temperatures would increase; how much the polar ice caps would melt; andhow quickly sea levels would rise.Nature , The International Weekly Journal of Science, published an article onJune 18, 2007 detailing how springtime in the Arctic is arriving two weeksearlier than it did in 1997. Processes that mark the beginning of spring, suchas flowers blooming and birds laying eggs, are now happening an average of morethan 14 days earlier in the calendar because of rising temperatures. Thediscovery adds to the litany of changes to ecosystems that are occurring inresponse to changing climates around the world. However, the rate at whichchanges are occurring in the high Arctic far outstrips that seen elsewhere inthe Northern Hemisphere. Previous worldwide studies of animals and plants havesuggested that, globally, the beginning of spring is advancing by around fivedays per decade.The native Inuit’s of the Arctic are worried about changing actions of the sun,it appears to be rising earlier and faster than usual. Elders across Nunavuthave noticed that the sun and stars have changed their position in the sky. Thesun is now rising higher and staying longer than it used to.Scientists see this as an optical effect owing to rising temperatures in thenorth. For the past several years, residents in the High Arctic have observedthat the winter dark season is ending earlier than usual, with the sun coming upat a different place than what people are used to seeing.Wayne Davidson, who is the resident meteorologist in Resolute Bay, said thelikely cause of this “rising sun” mystery is a temperature difference betweenthe very cold air over the snow and the air above, which has been warmer thanusual.Glaciologist Dr. Roy Koerner, with the Geological Survey of Canada, agreed,comparing it to sticking a fork into a glass of water: the fork appears to bendwhere it enters the water, he said.“So you get the same effect: you get this bent effect. Except in this case, thesun, which is just below the horizon, looks as if it's above the horizon, just abit of it,” he said.However, Inuit Elders say there is more going on then manmade global warming.The Elders say our world has tilted on its axis in the direction of the sun andthis contributes to climate change. They explain that this is why the sun ishigher in the sky and there is increased and more direct heat entering theArctic ecosystem. This has subsequently altered migratory routes of animals,warmed the ocean water, and thinned the ice cover.The entire subject of climate change remains mired in controversy because ofpolitical and religious opposition and mistrust to science in general. Skepticsinsist that global warming is a myth propagated by left-wing scientists opposedto big oil and the auto industry. Nevertheless, it is obvious that globalwarming is worrying many of the power elite. Substantial amounts of money haveflowed from certain global corporations into the pockets of politicians toensure that any mention of climate change is to be treated with contempt.This could also be a factor on why a new energy technology, some originatingwith Tesla, has been continuously suppressed. Current petroleum based energyconsumption makes too much money for the small faction of the wealthy elite tolet go so easily. Science, education, and new technologies are deliberately heldback from the majority of the world’s population. This is because of the fearthat the status quo will shift away from the secret power brokers and allow therest of us to enjoy what has been denied for so long.[Image00009.gif]CHAPTER TEN TESLA AND TIMEOf all the claims made about Nikola Tesla and his amazing experiments, time andits mysteries are among his most controversial. Today, physicists are still atodds on the basic realities and true nature of time. When you bring up the ideaof time travel, most scientists would prefer not to even broach the subject forfear of being ostracized by their peers.Much of ancient Greek philosophy was concerned with understanding the concept ofeternity, and the subject of time is central to all the world's religions andcultures. Can the flow of time be stopped or slowed? Certainly some mysticsthought so. Angelus Silesius, a 17th-century philosopher and poet, thought theflow of time could be influenced by the human mind:Time is of your own making; Its clock ticks in your head. The moment you stopthought Time too stops dead.The line between science and mysticism sometimes grows thin. Today physicistswould agree that time is one of the strangest properties of our universe. Infact, there is a story circulating among scientists of an immigrant to Americawho has lost his watch. He walks up to a man on a New York street and asks,“Please, sir, what is time?” The scientist replies, “I'm sorry, you'll have toask a philosopher. I'm just a physicist.”Ever since Einstein revealed his special theory of relativity, we have knownthat time travel, at least moving forward through time, is possible. But, whatabout traveling to the past? Could that be possible? Various researchers havesuggested ways in which backward and forward time machines can be built that donot seem to violate any known laws of physics. The physics of time travel isstill in its infancy and even though all physicists today admit that time travelto the future is possible; many still believe time travel to the past will neverbe easily attainable.Nikola Tesla, however, may have had an unnerving experience that showed it waspossible to move outside what we would term “normal time and space.” By removingone's self from the flow of time, it could therefore be possible to travelfreely both forwards and backwards in time.We now know that Tesla was interested and experimented in such \"wild\" ideas asfree energy, antigravity, invisibility and even time travel. It's no surprisethat Tesla in his day was loathe to speak of these kinds of interests-after all,even today these areas of study still come under fire by some mainstreamscientists, who refuse to use their imaginations and intellect and scorn suchinterests with terms such as “bad science” and “quackery.”Since the time of Tesla’s death, there have been a number of top-secret programsthat were either investigating, or, shockingly enough, actively using technologybased on some of Tesla's “wild” ideas. Both the United States and Russia haveactive Particle Beam and RF (radio frequency) weaponry that has been inoperation since the early 1970s, all because of Tesla's early 19th and 20thCentury experiments.To say that there are other black budget projects involving Tesla-based researchwould vastly underestimate the total amount of research and development beingconducted right now by many countries worldwide. The point being is that theseare the projects that we know about. Who knows how many deep, dark, secretprojects are in development right now with science and technology that could bedecades, even hundreds of years, beyond what civilian science knows today?OUTSIDE OF TIME AND SPACEIn 1895, while conducting research with his step-up transformer, Nikola Teslahad his first indications that time and space could be influenced by usinghighly charged, rotating magnetic fields. Part of this revelation came aboutfrom Tesla's experimentation with radio frequencies and the transmission ofelectrical energy through the atmosphere. Tesla's simple discovery would, yearslater, lead to the infamous Philadelphia Experiment and the Montauk time travelprojects.Even before these highly top-secret military programs came about, Tesla madesome fascinating discoveries on the nature of time and the real possibilities oftime travel. With these experiments in high-voltage electricity and magneticfields, Tesla discovered that time and space could be breached, or warped,placing anyone within this field outside of time/space, yet capable of observingthe past/present and infinite possibilities of futures. With this monumentaldiscovery, Tesla also discovered, through personal experience, the very realdangers inherent with time travel.Tesla's brush with time travel came in March 1895. A reporter for the New YorkHerald wrote on March 13 that he came across the inventor in a small café,looking shaken after being hit by 3.5 million volts, “I am afraid,” said Tesla,“that you won't find me a pleasant companion tonight. The fact is I was almostkilled today. The spark jumped three feet through the air and struck me here onthe right shoulder. If my assistant had not turned off the current instantly itmight have been the end of me.”Tesla, on contact with the resonating electromagnetic charge, found himselfoutside his time-frame reference. He reported that he could see the immediatepast, present and future, all at once. However, he was paralyzed within theelectromagnetic field, unable to help himself. His assistant, by turning off thecurrent, released Tesla before any permanent damage had occurred.Because of this accident, Tesla began to theorize about electricity andmagnetism's power to warp, or rather, change, space and time and the procedureby which man could forcibly control this power. Near the end of his life, Teslawas fascinated with the idea of light as both a particle and a wave, afundamental proposition already incorporated into quantum physics. Before thisincident, Tesla had been developing his own “unified field theory” to explainthe workings of the universe. Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity explains therelation between gravitation and electromagnetic force as a unified field theory(a model over matter, the aether, and energy). It is a unified field theory tounify all the fundamental forces (such as the force between all masses) andparticle responses into a single theoretical framework.TESLA’S DYNAMIC THEORY OF GRAVITYTesla theory that gravity is a field effect has been proven correct by thediscovery of gravity waves. At the time of his announcement, his critique onEinstein's work was considered by the scientific establishment to exceed thebounds of reason. While this theory is disputed by some or simply ignored byothers, it does not change the clear indication of the resurfacing of manysupposedly \"new\" ether based theories by current scientists. Initially developedbetween 1892 and 1895 during the period in which he was conducting experimentswith high frequency and high potential currents and electromagnetism, it wassubsequently never officially published. Though these principles guided hisfuture research and experiments, Tesla did not announce his theory until nearthe end of his life after he had been disillusioned by the war efforts. TheDynamic Theory of Gravity neither appears nor is mentioned anywhere in standardTesla informative sites and reportedly, is still classified and unavailableunder the FOIA.Tesla published a prepared statement on his 81st birthday (July 10, 1937)critiquing Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. The following is a portion ofthat statement:“... Supposing that the bodies act upon the surrounding space causing curving ofthe same, it appears to my simple mind that the curved spaces must react on thebodies, and producing the opposite effects, straightening out the curves. Sinceaction and reaction are coexistent, it follows that the supposed curvature ofspace is entirely impossible. But even if it existed, it would not explain themotions of the bodies as observed. Only the existence of a field of force canaccount for the motions of the bodies as observed, and its assumption dispenseswith space curvature. All literature on this subject is futile and destined tooblivion. So are all attempts to explain the workings of the universe withoutrecognizing the existence of the ether and the indispensable function it playsin the phenomena.“My second discovery was of a physical truth of the greatest importance. As Ihave searched the entire scientific records in more than a half dozen languagesfor a long time without finding the least anticipation, I consider myself theoriginal discoverer of this truth, which can be expressed by the statement:There is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment.”While this statement asserted that Tesla had \"worked out a dynamic theory ofgravity\" that he soon hoped to give to the world, he reportedly died before hepublicized the details. There is still a halo of mystery around his death – eventhe exact date is not certain. It is speculated that his death may have beencaused by too much “pressure” by agents in order to extract and obtain thesecret documents regarding this theory. Unfortunately, Tesla publicly revealedfew details about his theory. Available details argument against space beingcurved by gravitational effects, which leads some to believe Tesla failed tounderstand Einstein's theory is not about curved space at all, but curvedspace-time. Tesla was actively conducting tangible experiments during the timeof Einstein's theoretical research. He underlined that time was a mere man-madereference used for convenience and as such the idea of a “curved space-time” wasdelusional, hence there was no basis for the Relativistic “space-time” binomiumconcept.As an alternative to Einstein's general relativity, the Dynamic Theory ofGravity explained the fields of gravity through electrodynamics. Tesla statedthat there was no energy in matter other than that received from itsenvironment: he did not accept the mass-energy equivalence as delineated byspecial relativity. Tesla rejected this concept from Einstein, as the specialrelativity theory's principles ignored gravitational effects.Tesla explained that gravity was directly linked to electromagnetic phenomena,and that the sun and all stars emit “primary solar rays,” which in turn producesecondary radiations. Tesla's theory states that the phenomenon produced byelectromagnetic forces is the most important phenomenon in the universe.According to portions from his theory, mechanical motions are universally aresult of electromagnetic force acting upon and through media. Unfortunately, nomathematical details of the theory have officially surfaced.Tesla demonstrated that all bodies have electrical content and as such, are allmoving charges as our earth hurls through space at incredible speed (hence“dynamic”). He demonstrated, with high voltage coils powered by high frequencyalternators, how the Earth emanates “microwaves” and how it behaves as a chargedsphere. Based on these discoveries and their confirmation at Colorado Springs,he developed and tested his first electromagnetic machine that could fly “devoidof sustaining wings, propellers or gas bags.”Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity led to the idea of creating a “wall of light”by manipulating electromagnetic waves in a certain pattern. This mysterious wallof light would enable time, space, gravity and matter to be altered at will.This engendered an array of Tesla proposals that seem to leap straight out ofscience fiction pulp magazines, including anti-gravity airships, teleportation,and time travel.Taking this all into consideration, did Tesla's 1895 incident have any bearingon persistent rumors that the alleged “Philadelphia Experiment” may have beenpossible due to contributions from Tesla? These allegations have come frompeople such as the late Al Bielek who said that Tesla helped design theelectrical equipment used on the U.S.S. Eldridge. Bielek states that Teslabecame concerned that his equipment would once again warp time, space, resultingin dire consequences for the sailors onboard. However, the Navy ignored Tesla'sobjections and continued with their experiments.This gross lack of regard for the men onboard the ship led to exactly what Teslahad feared: the sailors involved found themselves outside their time-framereference with disastrous results. Some vanished completely, never to be seenagain. Others burst into flames upon return to normal spacetime. Even morehorrifying, some men were found melded with the metal infrastructure of the shipand still alive, at least for a short period of time.There is some doubt on whether or not Tesla was actually involved with thePhiladelphia Experiment. According to those who claimed to have been there atthe time, the experiments took place in July and August of 1943, but Tesla diedin his hotel room in New York City in January 1943. Most historians say thatTesla had been ill for quite some time beforehand so it would not have beenpossible for him to have contributed much to the experiment.Bielek says that in 1931 a small group of scientists got together in Chicago toinvestigate the possibility of de-magnifying warships. The team included JohnHutchinson, the Dean of the University of Chicago, Dr. Emil Kurtinauor, anAustrian physicist, and Nikola Tesla. At the time, the U.S. Navy was mainlyconcerned with the prospect of making its vessels anti-magnetic, but in 1936,Tesla, using the information he had gathered from his 1895 accident, achievedpartial invisibility under laboratory conditions. The Navy saw immensepossibilities and 1940 saw the beginning of Project Rainbow.Therefore, it could very well be that Tesla was involved with Project Rainbowduring its early stages, but because of moral and health reasons, withdrew fromthe project several years before his death. This was unfortunate because Tesla'ssecret time travel experiments would continue in the hands of others who werenot as concerned with humanity as Tesla. We are left with rumors andspeculations on who may have become the heirs of Tesla's research. I hope thatsomeday these secrets will be revealed once and for all.[Image00010.gif]CHAPTER ELEVEN THE TESLA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY CONNECTIONAt the beginning of the 21st century it became clear that a new, cleaner andmore efficient source of energy was needed if our society was going to survivethe next 100 years. The science of energy production has changed little sincethe 19th century; the majority of our energy comes from burning things. Oil andcoal are the chief suppliers of 21st century energy. Everything else currentlytakes a back seat to these two energy-producing leviathans.Even though modern technology has brought solar, wind and even cleaner versionsof nuclear energy closer to being both cost efficient and safe, there is not yetany real standout when it comes to new forms of alternative energy production.We discussed Tesla's interest in “free energy” in chapter seven. In the timebetween the original publication of The Lost Journals of Nikola Tesla and thisnew edition, the price of gasoline and natural gas has risen to such an extentthat some scientists have speculated that humanity will have to return to anon-technological agrarian society in order to survive. However, before suchrash action is taken, the research conducted by Tesla along the lines ofalternative energy must be continued using what we have learned since his death.Some of Tesla's electrical projects, like his transmission tower constructed onLong Island NY, have been incorrectly called “free energy” devices. Tesla'sdream was to be able to transmit electrical energy, without the use of wires, toany point around the world. However, his Wardenclyffe tower was set to bepowered by the burning of coal, not by using some mysterious alternative energysource. Tesla did envision other towers that could generate electricity usinghydroelectricity, wind, and other conventional means. Tesla was alsoexperimenting with other means of generating power that remain highlycontroversial even today.One of his most interesting claims was that free energy could be harnessed fromthe voltage difference in the ionosphere that causes lightning. This researchhad been conducted during Tesla's time spent in Colorado Springs in 1899. Thescientist realized that there existed an amazing energy potential containedwithin the atmosphere as demonstrated by the fierce thunderstorms that roaredover the Rocky Mountains. In 1932, Tesla claimed that he had harnessed thecosmic rays and caused them to operate a motive device.“Cosmic ray investigation is a subject that is very close to me. I was the firstto discover these rays and I naturally feel toward them as I would toward my ownflesh and blood. I have advanced a theory of the cosmic rays and at every stepof my investigations I have found it completely justified. The attractivefeature of cosmic rays is their constancy. They shower down on us throughout thewhole 24 hours, and if a plant is developed to use their power it will notrequire devices for storing energy as would be necessary with devices usingwind, tide or sunlight. All of my investigations seem to point to the conclusionthat they are small particles, each carrying so small a charge that we arejustified in calling them neutrons. They move with great velocity, exceedingthat of light. More than 25 years ago, I began my efforts to harness the cosmicrays and I can now state that I have succeeded in operating a motive device bymeans of them. I will tell you in the most general way, the cosmic ray ionizesthe air, setting free many charges ions and electrons. These charges arecaptured in a condenser which is made to discharge through the circuit of themotor. I have hopes of building my motor on a large scale, but circumstanceshave not been favorable to carrying out my plan.”In a series of newspaper articles, Tesla further explained his amazing ideas.New York American,November 1, 1933 Device to Harness Cosmic Energy Claimed byTesla:“This new power for the driving of the world's machinery will be derived fromthe energy which operates the universe, the cosmic energy, whose central sourcefor the earth is the sun and which is everywhere present in unlimitedquantities.”As I mentioned in an earlier chapter, Tesla's first radiant energy receiverstored static electricity obtained from the air and converted it to a usableform. Tesla's invention is a simple version of T.H. Moray's device. Moray'sdevice used a unique rectifier (RE-valve) to efficiently capture the staticelectricity from the surrounding air. Moray's oscillator tubes (magnetrontransducers) utilized this high-voltage energy to generate an internal secondary“cold” fusion reaction. Stick an antenna up in the air, the higher the better,and wire it to one side of a capacitor, the other going to a good earth ground,and the potential difference will then charge the capacitor. Connect across thecapacitor some sort of switching device so that it can be discharged at rhythmicintervals, and you have an oscillating electric output. T.H. Moray simplyexpanded on Tesla's idea to use high-voltage to create ionic oscillation.Tesla's free-energy concept was patented in 1901 as an “Apparatus for theUtilization of Radiant Energy.” The patent refers to “the sun, as well as othersources of radiant energy, like cosmic rays.” That the device works at night isexplained in terms of the night-time availability of cosmic rays. Tesla alsorefers to the ground as \"a vast reservoir of negative electricity.\"On his 76th birthday, at his yearly ritual press conference, Tesla announced a“cosmic-ray motor.” When asked if it was more powerful than the Crooke'sradiometer, he answered, “Thousands of times more powerful.”In 1901, Tesla was one the first to identify “radiant energy.” Tesla says thatthe source of this energy is our Sun. He concluded that the Sun emits smallparticles, each carrying so small of a charge that they move with greatvelocity, exceeding that of light. Tesla further states that these particles arethe neutron particles. Tesla believed that these neutron particles wereresponsible for all radioactive reactions. Radiant matter is in tune with theseneutron particles. Radiant matter is simply a retransmitter of energy from onestate to another.Tesla explained how his radiant energy receiver worked. However, hisdescriptions have been met with scorn by most electrical engineers. From theelectric potential that exists between the elevated plate (plus) and the ground(minus), energy builds up in the capacitor, and, after “a suitable timeinterval,” the accumulated energy will “manifest itself in a powerful discharge”that can do work. The capacitor, says Tesla, should be “of considerableelectrostatic capacity, and its dielectric made of the best quality mica, for ithas to withstand potentials that could rupture a weaker dielectric.”Tesla gives various options for the switching device. One is a rotary switchthat resembles a Tesla circuit controller; another is an electrostatic deviceconsisting of two very light, membranous conductors suspended in a vacuum. Thesesense the energy build-up in the capacitor, one charging positive, the othernegative, and, at a certain charge level, are attracted, touch, and thus firethe capacitor. Tesla also mentions another switching device consisting of aminute air gap or weak dielectric film that breaks down suddenly when a certainpotential is reached. Tesla received two patents for this radiant energy device;U.S. Patent No. 685,957 - Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy andU.S. Patent No. 685,958 - Method of Utilizing Radiant Energy. Both these patentswere filed on March 21, 1901 and granted on November 5, 1901. In these patentshe explains:“The sun, as well as other sources of radiant energy, throws off minuteparticles of matter positively electrified, which, impinging upon the upperplate, communicate continuously an electrical charge to the same. The oppositeterminal of the condenser being connected to ground, which may be considered asa vast reservoir of negative electricity, a feeble current flows continuouslyinto the condenser and inasmuch as the particles are ...charged to a very highpotential, this charging of the condenser may continue, as I have actuallyobserved, almost indefinitely, even to the point of rupturing the dielectric.”Tesla's intent was to condense the energy trapped between the earth and itsupper atmosphere and to transform it into an electric current. He pictured thesun as an immense ball of electricity, positively charged with a potential ofsome 200 billion volts. The earth, on the other hand, is charged with negativeelectricity. The tremendous electrical force between these two bodiesconstituted, at least in part, what he called cosmic energy. It varied fromnight to day and from season to season but it is always present.The positive particles are stopped at the ionosphere and between it and thenegative charges in the ground, a distance of 60 miles; there is a largedifference of voltage - something on the order of 360,000 volts. With the gasesof the atmosphere acting as an insulator between these two opposite stores ofelectrical charges, the region between the ground and the edge of space traps agreat deal of energy. Despite the large size of the planet, it is electricallylike a capacitor which keeps positive and negative charges apart by using theair as a non-conducting material and as an insulator.The Earth has a charge of 96,500 coulombs. With a potential of 360,000 volts,the earth constitutes a capacitor of .25 farads (farads ‘ coulombs/volts). Ifthe formula for calculating the energy stored in a capacitor (E ‘1/2CV2) isapplied to the Earth, it turns out that the ambient medium contains 1.6 x 1011joules or 4.5 megawatt-hours of electrical energy. In order to utilize thishigh-voltage energy you must do two things: make an energy sink and then devisea way of making the “sink” oscillate.Such a sink has to be at a lower energy state than the surrounding medium and,for the energy to continually flow into it, the energy must be continuallypumped out of it. Additionally, this sink must maintain a lower energy statewhile meeting the power requirements of the load attached to it. Electricalenergy, watt-seconds, is a product of volts x amps x seconds. Because the periodof oscillation does not change, either voltage or current has to be the variablein this system's energy equation. Bifilar wound coils are used in the systembecause a bifilar wound coil maximizes the voltage difference between its turns.The current is then minimized.A coil in our system, then, will be set into oscillation at its resonantfrequency by an external power source. During the “zero-point” portion of itscycle the coil will appear as one plate of a capacitor. As the voltage acrossthe coil increases, the amount of charge it can siphon will increase. The energythat is taken into the coil through the small energy window (zero-point), callit what you will, appears to be the key to the success of this system. It is atthis zero-point where energy is condensed into positive and negative componentsof current. When energy escapes from the \"sink\" the magnetic field collapses anda strong magnetic quake is created in its wake. A properly tuned system cancapture and convert radiant energy in such a prescribed arrangement.The radiant energy system is a self-oscillating capacitive system. Once it isset into oscillation, very little power is expended in keeping it going. Becauseit is an electrostatic oscillating system, only a small amount of charge movesthrough the system per cycle, that is, the coulomb per seconds amps are low. Ifthe charge is used at a low rate, the energy stored in the system will be turnedinto heat at a slow rate enabling the oscillations to continue for a long periodof time.Tesla's “COIL FOR ELECTRO MAGNETS,” patent #512,340, is a very special coildesign because, unlike an ordinary coil made by turning wire on a tube form,this one uses two wires laid next to each other on a form but with the end ofthe first one connected to the beginning of the second one. In this patent Teslaexplains that the double coil will store many times the energy of a conventionalcoil. Measurements of two coils of the same size and with the same number ofturns, one with a single, the other with a bifilar winding, show differences involtage gain. These bifilar Tesla's coils can be explained solely on the basisof their electrical activity. A bifilar coil is capable of holding more chargethan a single wound coil. When operated at resonance, the distributedcapacitance of the bifilar coil is able to overcome the counter-electromotiveforce (e.m.f.) normal to coils, inductive reactance.Because of the electrical activity, a bifilar coil does not work against itselfin the form of a countere.m.f. The potential across the coil quickly builds to ahigh value. The difference between the turns becomes great enough that theenergy is practically all potential, at this point; the system becomes anelectrostatic oscillator. Minimal work is done in the radiant energy system dueto the absence of wasted displacement currents. As small heat losses occur,oscillations are maintained by surplus charge generated by atomic catalyticreactions, and energy is siphoned from the kinetic moments of these charges.Very low energy expenditure allows power delivery to an electrical load over anextended time period without an external fuel supply. After an initial input ofenergy from an outside source, the radiant energy electrical generator willoperate as a very efficient device.By reviewing history it is understandable why some inventions are notcommercialized. It is economics, not science that is the main factor. It will beremembered that alternating current was opposed by powerful financiers inTesla's time.Michael Pupin, noted in his 1923 autobiography, “...captains of industry...whowere afraid that they would have to scrap some of their direct current apparatusand the plants for manufacturing it, if the alternating current system receivedany support. A most un-American attitude...but ignorance and false notionsprevailed in the early nineties, because the captains of electrical industriespaid small attention to highly trained scientists.”Philadelphia Public Ledger,November 2, 1933 Tesla \"Harnesses\" Cosmic EnergyInventor announces discovery to displace fuel in driving machinery. Calls Sunmain source. A principle by which power for driving machinery of the world maybe developed from the cosmic energy which operates the universe has beendiscovered by Nikola Tesla, noted physicist and inventor of scientific devices,he announced today. This principle, which taps a source of power described as\"everywhere present in unlimited quantities\" and which may be transmitted bywire or wireless from central plants to any part of the globe, will eliminatethe need of coal, oil, gas or any other of the common fuels, he said. Dr. Tesla,in a statement today at his hotel, indicated the time was not far distant whenthe principle would be ready for practical commercial development. Asked whetherthe sudden introduction of his principle would upset the present economicsystem, Dr. Tesla replied, \"It is badly upset already.\" He added that now asnever before was the time ripe for the development of new resources. While inits present form, the theory calls for the development of energy in centralplants requiring vast machinery, Dr. Tesla said he might be able to work out aplan for its use by individuals. The central source of cosmic energy for theearth is the Sun, Dr. Tesla said, but \"night will not interrupt the flow of thenew power supply.\"MODERN RESEARCH OF TESLA’S IDEASMuch of Tesla's research along these lines has been taken and utilized by theU.S. (and other countries’) military. Because of this, private research isdiscouraged and some inventors have even found themselves the victims of strangeaccidents and other forms of obvious harassment. Other researchers have had someinteresting successes, as well as some disappointing setbacks.According to a 2004 article by the Pure Energy Systems News Service, Craig West(pseudonym) successfully built for himself a device that outputs four kilowattswith much less than that required for excitation of the device. The device evencontinued output with the excitation source removed in a closed loop. Though tooutward appearances the device seemed “self-powered,” West knew that the energyhad to be coming from somewhere.His hope, of course, was that he had been able to tap into “the vast sea ofenergy that surrounds us,” spoken of by inventors such as Nikola Tesla and T.Henry Moray. He is quick to mention that the design is not his. He learned itfrom a gentleman in Arizona, who demonstrated to him a one million watt outputbefore the wires in the coil disintegrated.With his success, West had investors with 30 million dollars lined up; 10million up front for a demo, and the remaining 20 million to tell them how itworks. The device worked fine, with repeatable results when he operated it inArizona where he built it. But when he returned to his remote home in Californiathat is operated by solar energy, far away from civilization, let alone anypower lines, the device no longer output more than what went in. Nothing but thelocation of the device had changed.The location in Arizona where he built the device is in the vicinity of highpower lines, which traipse the landscape throughout Arizona. West also said thathe saw a report on the web about Arizona installing new super conducting,underground, high-power lines that convey power from Arizona to Mexico.An electrical engineer who was in on the interview with West mentioned that itis known that if a barbed wire fence, of about a mile in length, withinsulators, is run parallel to a high power line that a “one-turn transformer”can be created, inductively coupling some of the power of the high-power lines.Then, as this story was being composed, a story broke in the UK in which anArtist-Physicist, Richard Box, lit 1300 fluorescent lights from “spareelectricity just floating around in the air around the electric pylons which dotour countryside.” (Evening Post, UK, Feb. 19, 2004)West thinks that the device he built, patterned after that of his associate inArizona, is somehow serving as a wireless transformer. “Other technologies mayin fact be tapping into aetheric energy, but at this point it looks as thoughthis particular family of designs does not.”An obvious example would be the radiant energy experiments done by Nikola Teslain which no high-power lines were present. While this pops his bubble ofthinking he had learned to tap aetheric energy, he nevertheless realizes thatthere are a wide range of practical applications that the power companies wouldfind of great use.Running electricity to a home remote from the grid is prohibitively expensive.Every few hundred feet can cost thousands of dollars. This device would enablehomes that are within a few miles of high power lines to be able to wirelesslytap into those lines. The exact efficiencies over a given distance are not yetcharacterized. West is not yet even certain that this is indeed what ishappening with his device. He plans to pursue a series of experiments todocument and characterize this phenomenon. When the weather clears, and he canget enough money for a tank of gas, he will be making his way to the vicinity ofa high power line to see how his device performs. He will then measure theeffect at different distances from the line as well as nearby a transformerstation.Another alternative energy researcher, Larry Rand, citing the work of Dr. TomBearden, says that West should not be to hasty to presume that the high-powerline effect is due to his device tapping into the electricity being transmittedby those lines. “Perhaps in this case the power company lines and the deviceform somewhat of a resonant condition that allows some of the same 'power' fromthe universe that goes into the power company lines to enter the device.”“According to conventional physics, there should be little power collected fromthe power company's transmission lines, unless huge coils are used in fairlyclose proximity,” says Rand.Rand even goes so far as to suggest that what is actually happening is that thepower grid's method of generating electricity absorbs the lines of aethericenergy away from areas where they would otherwise flow, thus inadvertentlyrobbing everyone in the power line vicinity from equal access to this freeenergy source from the universe.Taking this a step further, Electrical Engineer, Ken Rauen, points out that“aetheric energy flow that is redirected means natural energy flows aredisrupted.” He then asks, “What are the full ramifications on the environmentand biological health?”Inventor Hector D. Perez Torres of Advanced Research Knowledge asserts, “Powercompany lines act as a sink for natural-occurring RF radiant energy waves in lowto very low frequencies (LF/VLF) from 10 kHz to 535 kHz.” He said the powerdistribution entities know of some interactions between naturally occurring VLFfrequencies emitted from the earth, and that they invert lines at intervals andplace filters and suppressors in line to counteract these effects. “Utilitycompanies expend millions in filtering geodesic 'noise' that affects theirsystems, like in solar storms.”If it is actually a case of tapping into the electricity in the transmissionlines, and not aetheric energy being amplified by the lines, what West is mostconcerned about is that people will make these devices with the specific intentof stealing power from the grid, similar to unscrupulous pirating devices in thewireless world of entertainment.“They are not that difficult to build. It took me 30 minutes to figure it out.”In the same breath, he hopes that the power community will not just run off withhis technology for its use as a wireless transformer and leave him out of theloop. They could benefit tremendously from his knowledge in coming up with waysto detect such devices from a signature frequency output, to be able tointercept individuals tapping power without proper authorization to do so.Torres postulates that if we use this power we do not steal power from them buthelp them suppress the ELF signal improving their transmission. While it may notturn out to be the holy grail of free energy, it could be a great tool in energydistribution, and could even have applications in wirelessly poweringappliances.West is not alone in having created such a device. There are dozens, if nothundreds of individuals around the planet who have built similar devices thatoperate on the same basic principles. The pioneers in this field are LesterHendershot, inventor of the “Power Capture Unit” (1920s); and the late Floyd“Sparky” Sweet, inventor of the Vacuum Triode Amplifier (VTA) or Space QuantumModulator (1986).West referred to an inventor in Bullhead City, Earl Davenport, who has a set-upvery similar to his, and speculated that his \"over unity,\" (more power comingout than put in) was purportedly confirmed by Walter Rosenthal and is a functionof high-power lines nearby. Across the river, not ten miles away, in LaughlinNevada, is a large power plant, with high power lines extending from it in alldirections. Joseph Newman's motor is another possible variation of this wirelesstransformer phenomenon, according to West. It has a super long wire, with decentcapacitance. “Some people build it and claim it works well, others build it andit doesn't work so well. It just may be the story of ‘location, location,location.’”CONTINUED RESEARCH INTO WIRELESS POWERYears later, Tesla's dream of the wireless transmission of energy is stillalive. In January 2009, a company called PowerBeam announced their developmentof a device that broadcasts electricity and may render electrical wiring ancienthistory. The device, called WiTricity, beams power to laptops, mobile phones andstereos without cables or sockets.“We’re going to delete the word ‘recharge’ from the dictionary,” British tabloidThe Sun quoted David Graham, co-founder of PowerBeam.He has revealed that the technology converts electricity into an invisible heatlaser, and shoots it across a room. As soon as the laser hits a solar cellinside any electric appliance, according to him, it is converted back toelectricity.Graham says that, presently, the device can beam 1.5watts of power to a solarcell 30ft away, and that can easily be scaled up. In future, WiTricity isexpected to operate like internet Wi-Fi with “hotspots,” where all gadgets wouldpower up automatically.James Holland, editor of gadgets website electricpig.co.uk, said: “You’d buy adesk that charged any gadget placed on it. You’d never need to hunt for theright charger again.”In addition, in 2007, a team from MIT's Department of Physics, Department ofElectrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Institute for SoldierNanotechnologies (ISN) has experimentally demonstrated that Tesla's ideas arefeasible. The team was able to light a 60W light bulb from a power source sevenfeet away; there was no physical connection between the source and theappliance. The MIT team also refers to its concept as “WiTricity” (as inwireless electricity).WiTricity is based on using coupled resonant objects. Two resonant objects ofthe same resonant frequency tend to exchange energy efficiently, whileinteracting weakly with extraneous off-resonant objects. A child on a swing is agood example of this. A swing is a type of mechanical resonance, so only whenthe child pumps her legs at the natural frequency of the swing is she able toimpart substantial energy. Another example involves acoustic resonances: Imaginea room with 100 identical wine glasses, each filled with wine up to a differentlevel, so they all have different resonant frequencies. If an opera singer singsa sufficiently loud single note inside the room, a glass of the correspondingfrequency might accumulate sufficient energy to even explode, while notinfluencing the other glasses. In any system of coupled resonators there oftenexists a so-called “strongly coupled” regime of operation. If one ensures tooperate in that regime in a given system, the energy transfer can be veryefficient.While these considerations are universal, applying to all kinds of resonances(e.g., acoustic, mechanical, electromagnetic, etc.), the MIT team focused on oneparticular type: magnetically coupled resonators. The team explored a system oftwo electromagnetic resonators coupled mostly through their magnetic fields;they were able to identify the strongly coupled regime in this system, even whenthe distance between them was several times larger than the sizes of theresonant objects. This way, efficient power transfer was enabled.Magnetic coupling is particularly suitable for everyday applications becausemost common materials interact only very weakly with magnetic fields, sointeractions with extraneous environmental objects are suppressed even further.This should negate any concerns that these devices might create any harmful sideeffects.“The fact that magnetic fields interact so weakly with biological organisms isalso important for safety considerations,” Andre Kurs, a graduate student inphysics, points out.The investigated design consists of two copper coils, each a self-resonantsystem. One of the coils, attached to the power source, is the sending unit.Instead of irradiating the environment with electromagnetic waves, it fills thespace around it with a non-radiative magnetic field oscillating at MHzfrequencies. The non-radiative field mediates the power exchange with the othercoil (the receiving unit), which is specially designed to resonate with thefield. The resonant nature of the process ensures the strong interaction betweenthe sending unit and the receiving unit, while the interaction with the rest ofthe environment is weak.Robert Moffatt, an MIT undergraduate in physics, explains, “The crucialadvantage of using the non-radiative field lies in the fact that most of thepower not picked up by the receiving coil remains bound to the vicinity of thesending unit, instead of being radiated into the environment and lost.”With such a design, power transfer has a limited range, and the range would beshorter for smallersize receivers. Still, for laptop-sized coils, power levelsmore than sufficient to run a laptop can be transferred over room-sizeddistances nearly omni-directionally and efficiently, irrespective of thegeometry of the surrounding space, even when environmental objects completelyobstruct the line-ofsight between the two coils.Peter Fisher says, “As long as the laptop is in a room equipped with a source ofsuch wireless power, it would charge automatically, without having to be pluggedin. In fact, it would not even need a battery to operate inside of such a room.In the long run, this could reduce our society's dependence on batteries, whichare currently inefficient, heavy and expensive.”At first glance, such a power transfer is reminiscent of relatively commonplacemagnetic induction, such as is used in power transformers, which contain coilsthat transmit power to each other over very short distances. An electric currentrunning in a sending coil induces another current in a receiving coil. The twocoils are very close, but they do not touch. However, this behavior changesdramatically when the distance between the coils is increased.As Aristeidis Karalis, a graduate student in electrical engineering and computerscience, points out, “Here is where the magic of the resonant coupling comesabout. The usual non-resonant magnetic induction would be almost one milliontimes less efficient in this particular system.”TESLA’S SUPPRESSED INVENTIONSThere are many inventions of Nikola Tesla that for one reason or another(conspiracy?), were never developed to their full capability...at least as faras we know. One such example is a generator that does not “burn any fuel.”According to researcher Oliver Nichelson, while Tesla was in college, he claimedit should be possible to operate an electrical motor with-out sparking brushes.He was told by the professor that such a motor would require perpetual motionand was, therefore, impossible. In the 1880's he patented the alternatingcurrent generator, motor, and transformer we use today.Ten years after virtually inventing modern electrical technology, Tesla claimedhe developed a generator that would not “consume any fuel.” Such a generatorwould not have a conventional source of energy such as oil, coal or fallingwater. This new generator would get energy from what he called the “ambientmedium.”For nearly 100 years researchers have sought the design for Tesla's “freeenergy” generator. Clues, in Tesla's own handwriting, to the nature of thedevice and how it operated have been uncovered. In 1976, an amazing letter wasfound in the Tesla Collection at Columbia University Library.The letter, written in 1902 by Tesla to Robert U. Johnson, describes Tesla'sidea for a new energy generator that “would not consume fuel.”Tesla may have been prompted to write this letter because of an article thatappeared on June 9th, 1902, in both the New York Times and the New York Herald.This story was about Clemente Figueras, a \"woods and forest engineer,\" in theCanary Islands who invented a device for generating electricity without burningany fuel. What became of Figueras and his fuel-less generator is not known, butshortly afterwards, Tesla sent a clipping of the Herald story in a letter to hisfriend Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine.In this letter, Tesla claimed he had already developed such a generator and tohave revealed the underlying physical laws. In the three-page letter Teslastates that he suggested such a generator in his Century magazine article, andthat he has worked on such a design for sometime.Tesla once called the June, 1900 Century article the most important he hadwritten. The “novel facts” citation mentioned in the letter is found on page 200of the article in the first column, next to the last paragraph, first sentence.Discussion of the “novel facts” just precedes the article's subsection dealingwith a “Self-Acting Machine...Capable...of Deriving Energy From the Medium.”A careful examination of the article reveals the inventor believed his designfor an electrical generator which is its own prime mover, that is, does not“consume any fuel,” would not violate the energy conservation principle. Teslabelieved, rather, that his design transformed one form of energy into another.This was just one of Tesla’s incredible ideas that have been apparently lost, orat least suppressed by unknown factors. Over the years, there have been many“garage” inventors and engineers who have attempted to carry on with some ofTesla’s ideas. The hope is that by using modern technology unavailable to Teslain his time, important scientific breakthroughs can be achieved. Unfortunately,many of these inventions have been met with little interest, scorn, andsometimes even threats if their development was to continue.DISK-TURBINE ROTARY ENGINETesla called it a powerhouse in a hat. One version developed 110 h.p. at 5000RPM and was less than ten inches in diameter. Tesla believed larger turbinescould achieve 1000 HP. The disk-turbine rotary engine runs vibration free. It ischeap to manufacture because nothing but the rotor bearings needs to be fittedto close tolerances. It requires little maintenance. If necessary, the rotor canbe replaced with ease. The turbine can run on steam, compressed air, gasoline,or oil.Unlike conventional turbines that use blades or buckets to catch the flow,Tesla's uses a set of rigid metal disks that, instead of battling the propellingstream at steep angles, runs with smooth efficiency in parallel with the flow.What drives the disks is a peculiar adhesion that exists between the surface ofa body and any moving fluid. This adhesion is, in Tesla's words, caused by theshock of the fluid against the asperities of the solid substance (simpleresistance) and from internal forces opposing molecular separation (a stickingphenomenon).The propellant enters the intake and is directed through a nozzle onto the disksat their perimeter. It travels over the spinning disks in a spiral fashion,exiting at the disks' central openings and is exhausted from the casing. Teslanotes in his patent that, in an engine driven by a fluid, changes in thevelocity and direction of movement of the fluid should be as gradual aspossible. This, he observes, is not the case, though, in existing engines wheresudden changes, shocks, and vibrations are unavoidable. The use of pistons,paddles, vanes and blades, notes Tesla, necessarily introduces numerous defectsand limitations and adds to the complication, cost of production, andmaintenance of the machines.The Tesla turbine is vibration-free because the propelling fluid moves innatural paths or streamlines of least resistance, free from constraint anddisturbance. Conducting the propellant through the intake valve on the otherside easily reverses the turbine.A hollow casting is bolted to the top of the turbine for the internal combustionmode. A glow plug or spark plug screws into the top of this chamber. Stickingout of the sides are the intake valves. Interesting thing about these valves,there are no moving parts. They work on a fluidic principle. The Tesla turbine’sonly moving part is its rotor. Imagine a powerful internal combustion enginewith only one moving part.The fluidic valve, which Tesla calls a valvular conduit, allows easy flow in onedirection but in the other the flow gets hung up in dead-end chambers (buckets)where it gets spun around 360 degrees, thus forming eddies, or countercurrents,that stop the flow as surely as if a mechanical valve were moved into the shutposition. The spinning rotor creates plenty of suction to pull fuel and air intothe combustion chamber. Tesla notes that after a short lapse of time the chamberbecomes heated to such a degree that the ignition device may be shut off withoutdisturbing the established regime…in other words, it diesels. The disk-turbinemotor principle in reverse becomes a very efficient pump. (Tesla's Patent No.1,061,142)The disk turbine principle is employed in the speedometer, which presents theproblem of having to turn the rotary motion of a vehicle’s wheels to angularmotion in order to push a spring-loaded indicator needle over a short arc.Tesla's solution: the speedometer cable connects to a disk which spins ininterface with a second disk, imparting spin to the fluid in between and, hence,to the second disk, which moves the needle. Interface two disks of differentsizes in a fluid medium and any desired ratio between speeds of rotation may beobtained by proper selection of the diameters of the disks, observes Tesla inhis patent, thus anticipating in 1911 the fluid-drive automatic transmission.Tesla First worked on his turbine early in his career, believing it would be agood prime mover for his alternating-current dynamos, far superior to thereciprocal steam engines that were the workhorses of that era. But he did notget down to perfecting and patenting it until after the collapse of his globalbroadcasting scheme (1909). By this time the internal-combustion piston enginewas firmly rooted in Western power mechanics. Tesla referred to organizedopposition to his attempts to introduce the superior engine, and so have otherswho have made the attempt since. But Tesla still saw a glorious future for histurbine. To his friend, Yale engineering professor Charles Scott, Teslapredicted, \"My turbine will scrap all the heat engines in the world.\" RepliedScott, \"That would make quite a pile of scrap.\"THE TESLA EARTHQUAKE MACHINEExcerpt from theNew York World Telegram, July 11, 1935Nikola Tesla revealed that an earthquake which drew police and ambulances to theregion of his laboratory at 48 E. Houston St., New York, in 1898, was the resultof a little machine he was experimenting with at the time which “you could putin your overcoat pocket.”The bewildered newspapermen pounced upon this as at least one thing they couldunderstand and “the father of modern electricity” told what had happened asfollows:“I was experimenting with vibrations. I had one of my machines going and Iwanted to see if I could get it in tune with the vibration of the building. Iput it up notch after notch. There was a peculiar cracking sound. I asked myassistants where the sound came from. They did not know. I put the machine up afew more notches. There was a louder cracking sound. I knew I was approachingthe vibration of the steel building. I pushed the machine a little higher.“Suddenly all the heavy machinery in the place was flying around. I grabbed ahammer and broke the machine. The building would have been about our ears inanother few minutes. Outside in the street there was pandemonium.“The police and ambulances arrived. I told my assistants to say nothing. We toldthe police it must have been an earthquake. That's all they ever knew about it.”Some shrewd reporter asked Dr. Tesla at this point what he would need to destroythe Empire State Building and the doctor replied: \"Vibration will do anything.It would only be necessary to step up the vibrations of the machine to fit thenatural vibration of the building and the building would come crashing down.In 1896, after a disastrous fire in his former laboratory, Tesla moved to 48Houston St. in Manhattan. For several years, he had considered the significanceof waves and resonance, thinking that along with the AC system, there were otheruntapped sources of power waiting to be exploited. The oscillators he designedand built were originally designed to provide a stable source for thefrequencies of alternating current and were accurate enough to “set your watchby.”He constructed a simple device consisting of a piston suspended in a cylinder,which bypassed the necessity of a camshaft driven by a rotating power source,such as a gasoline or steam engine. In this way, he hoped to overcome loss ofpower through friction produced by the old system.This small device also enabled Tesla to try out his experiments in resonance.Every substance has a resonant frequency that is demonstrated by the principleof sympathetic vibration; the most obvious example is the wine glass shatteredby an opera singer. If this frequency is matched and amplified, any material maybe literally shaken to pieces.A vibrating assembly with an adjustable frequency was finally perfected, andTesla conducted his infamous experiment as reported by the New York WorldTelegram. Intrigued by the results, Tesla put his little vibrator in hiscoat-pocket and went out to hunt a half-erected steel building. Down in the WallStreet district, he found one, a ten-story building of steel framework. Heclamped the vibrator to one of the beams, and adjusted the frequency.Tesla said finally the structure began to creak and weave and the steelworkerscame to the ground panic-stricken, believing that there had been an earthquake.The police were called, but Tesla simply put the vibrator in his pocket andwalked away. Ten minutes more and he could have knocked the building into thestreet. As well, with the same vibrator he could have dropped the BrooklynBridge into the East River in less than an hour.The whole assembly was designed to be powered by steam pressure. Tesla wasexperimenting with ways to transmit motive power through the Earth. Largeversions of these oscillators, weighing perhaps 200 pounds, and being aboutthree feet high could transmit usable motive power anywhere on the entireplanet.Steam would be forced into the oscillator, and exit through a series of ports,the net effect of which was to cause the armature to vibrate at high speed,within is casing. The casing was by necessity very strong, as temperatures dueto pressure heating in the upper chamber exceeded 200 degrees, and the pressurereached 400psi.Other versions of the machine were created, designed to produce electricalpower, both alternating and direct, (without the need for rectifiers). Teslaclaimed the device, properly modified, could be used to map underground depositsof oil. A vibration sent through the earth returns an \"echo signature\" using thesame principle as sonar. This idea was actually adapted for use by the petroleumindustry, and is used today in a modified form with devices used to locateobjects at archaeological digs.Unfortunately, no practical application of Tesla’s idea could be found at thetime that would make money for investors and the oscillators fell into disuse.However, rumor has it that the Soviet Union was working on a Tesla idea for aresonant tube as a weapon. The story goes that Stalin had Soviet scientists goback through scientific literature into the late 19th century to see if therewas anything they could develop to leapfrog the U.S., and they came upon Tesla’soscillators and experimented extensively with his ideas and patents.The idea was to induce a resonant frequency in a large metal tube that would actlike a harmonic cannon. They raised the frequency in steps until they reached acertain level of resonance that began to make the researchers violently ill.They allegedly abandoned the experiments in that range because it was realizedthat the focused resonance could actually kill people. It is likely that thiswas further developed into a weapon by both the USSR and the U.S.THE HUTCHISON EFFECTThe Canadian inventor John Hutchison is an enigma. He is no doubt that he is avery eccentric individual, yet, he is credited with one of science's mostunusual and controversial discoveries. It is described as a “highly-anomalouselectromagnetic effect which causes the jellification of metals, spontaneouslevitation of common substances, and other effects.” It is known as theHutchison Effect, or the H-Effect for short.What the H-Effect is purported to do is nothing short of extraordinary. It issaid to cause objects to defy gravity, cause metal to spontaneously fracture,cause dissimilar materials to fuse (such as metal and wood), and other strangephenomena.According to his website www.hutchisoneffect.ca, Hutchison's life drastically in1979 when, upon starting up an array of high-voltage equipment, he feltsomething hit his shoulder. He threw the piece of metal back to where it seemedto have originated, and it flew up and hit him again.This was how he originally rediscovered that fundamental frequencies can shieldgravity. When his Tesla coils, electrostatic generator, and other equipmentcreated a complex electromagnetic field, heavy pieces of metal levitated andshot toward the ceiling, conforming to the “BB Effect” and some pieces shredded.Upon analysis and thorough investigation, the Canadian government dubbed thisphenomenon the Hutchison-Effect.What is the Hutchison effect? It is a continuation of Nikola Tesla's and T.Townsend Brown's research with high frequency energies. When given “extra”voltage, elements suspend their “programming” and no longer conform to regularlaws of physics such as gravity. Some theorists think the effect is the resultof opposing electromagnetic fields canceling each other out, creating a powerfulflow of space energy. The Canadian government also reported invisible samplesphasing in and out of existence and seized most of those tapes, but not all ofthem.Much like Tesla, Hutchison is obsessed with his work. He conducts hisexperiments in his small apartment using surplus Navy and Army electronicequipment. His living space is crowded with oscilloscopes, digital readouts,gauges, switches, lights, receiver dishes, chains, and all manner of hardware.In fact, it was during an attempt to reproduce one of Tesla's experiments thatthe H-Effect was said to have been accidentally discovered.Hutchison's experiments use multiple electrical coils called Tesla coils, aswell as a static electricity machine called a Van de Graaf generator. How thesehigh-voltage devices work in concert to create the H-Effect is uncertain, butsupporters believe that a hypothetical electromagnetic wave called a scalar waveallowed Hutchison's apparatus to tap an exotic energy called zero-point energy.Zero-point energy is the energy present at zero degrees Kelvin zero Kelvins, thetemperature at which all activity in an atom supposedly ceases. It is alsocalled vacuum energy because it is descriptive of the energy in a perfectvacuum, where no light or matter is present. In this state, randomelectromagnetic oscillations can still be observed, meaning that there is stillsome amount of energy present. Essentially, the concept of tapping zero-pointenergy assumes that the universe is saturated in a constant background energywhich we cannot observe because it is present everywhere, even within ourselvesand our measuring devices. If such energy exists, it could be an enormousamount… it is theorized that there is enough energy in the volume the size of acoffee cup to completely boil away Earth’s oceans.Hutchison theorizes that he may be tapping into the universal source of energythat Tesla referred to as “radiant energy,” but the debate continues as hisexperiments have not been replicated elsewhere. There are several demonstrationvideos supposedly showing the phenomena, including a few short videos online andsome more involved footage that he sells by mail order. The online videos indeedfeature close-up shots of objects that appear to be levitating and moving instrange ways, but many suspect that Hutchison is a fraud out to make a quickbuck by using trick photography.Col. John Alexander in 1980, with funding from the Stanford Research Instituteand the CIA, conducted an exhaustive four-month study of the Hutchison effect. Ateam of four military scientists stayed with John to document his results, andfound all of them (as witnessed in the 1980's footage) to be quite real andunexplainable by conventional physics.Hutchison has also had problems with the Canadian government who supposedlyseized all of his priceless replications of Tesla's equipment. After many moreyears of experiments, demonstrations and lectures in other countries such as theUnited States, Germany and Japan, Hutchison returned to Vancouver in 1991. Pieceby piece, he built out of surplus Navy equipment what now has become somethingof a landmark in New Westminster, British Colombia. John has built himself animpressive apartment laboratory; however despite many obstacles, mostlypolitical. Hutchison now has his apartment lab equipped on a much smaller scaleand says that he can still demonstrate the effect, but that it is difficult tocontrol.Nikola Tesla also reported unusual phenomena when experimenting with extremelyhigh voltage – though Tesla did not elaborate on just what had occurred; onlystating that under certain conditions time/space and matter took on unusualcharacteristics. It is possible that John Hutchison has managed to replicate thesame strange occurrences that mystified Tesla. However, until these “effects”can be reproduced in other laboratories, the Hutchison Effect can only becategorized as a curiosity at best.THE TESLA DEATH RAYIn 1931, Tesla announced to reporters at a press conference that he was on theverge of discovering an entirely new source of energy. Asked to explain thenature of the power, he replied, “The idea first came upon me as a tremendousshock... I can only say at this time that it will come from an entirely new andunsuspected source.”On July 11, 1934 the headline on the front page of the New York Times read,“TESLA, AT 78, BARES NEW DEATH BEAM.” The article reported that the newinvention “will send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, ofsuch tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemyairplanes at a distance of 250 miles...” Tesla stated that the death beam wouldmake war impossible by offering every country an “invisible Chinese wall.”The idea generated considerable interest and controversy. Tesla went immediatelyto J. P. Morgan, Jr. in search of financing to build a prototype of hisinvention. Morgan was unconvinced. Tesla also attempted to deal directly withPrime Minister Neville Chamberlain of Great Britain. However, when Chamberlainresigned upon discovering that he had been out-maneuvered by Hitler at Munich,interest in Tesla's anti-war weapon eventually collapsed.By 1937, it was clear that war would soon break out in Europe. Frustrated in hisattempts to generate interest and financing for his “peace beam,” he sent anelaborate technical paper, including diagrams, to a number of Allied nationsincluding the United States, Canada, England, France, the Soviet Union, andYugoslavia. Titled “New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-Dispersive EnergyThrough Natural Media,” the paper provided the first technical description ofwhat is today called a charged particle beam weapon.What set Tesla's proposal apart from the usual run of fantasy “death rays” was aunique vacuum chamber with one end open to the atmosphere. Tesla devised aunique vacuum seal by directing a high-velocity air stream at the tip of his gunto maintain “high vacua.” The necessary pumping action would be accomplishedwith a large Tesla turbine.Of all the countries to receive Tesla's proposal, the greatest interest camefrom the Soviet Union. In 1937 Tesla presented a plan to the Amtorg TradingCorporation, an alleged Soviet arms front in New York City. Two years later, in1939, one stage of the plan was tested in the USSR and Tesla received a checkfor $25,000.Tesla hoped that his invention would be used for purely defensive purposes, andthus would become an anti-war machine. His system required a series of powerplants located along a country's coast that would scan the skies in search ofenemy aircraft. Since the beam was projected in a straight line, it was onlyeffective for about 200 miles — the distance of the curvature of the earth.Tesla also contemplated peacetime applications for his particle beam, one beingto transmit power without wires over long distances. Another radical notion heproposed was to heat up portions of the upper atmosphere to light the sky atnight — a man-made aurora borealis.As far back as 1899, it was rumored that Tesla was experimenting with a “deathray” in Colorado Springs. But Tesla never admitted it, and in fact remaineduncommunicative about any experiments he had conducted with rays even whenEnglish, German, Russian, and American scientists in the 1920s were applying forpatents on the invention. By the 1930s, however, Tesla was ready to reveal hisconcept to the world.“It will,” he wrote, “provide a wall of power offering an insuperable obstacleagainst any effective aggression.”“My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopicdimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillionsof times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands ofhorse power can thus be transmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so thatnothing can resist.”Unfortunately, no one thought his energy beam weapon practical, not even theWestinghouse Company. This was unfortunate, because if Westinghouse had advancedTesla the money to file for the patents, he may have been able to develop theweapon World War II. As it was, Tesla’s death ray, his accelerated particle beamin which subatomic particles were excited by an energy field and directed towarda specific target at speeds close to the speed of light, was never developedduring his lifetime.However, the mere hint that Tesla’s theories might have found their way to theGermans or the Russians was very worrisome to the federal government. When Tesladied in January 1943, the FBI immediately seized all his papers, schematics,writings, and designs and turned them over to the Office of Alien Property,where they were officially sealed until released to the Yugoslavian ambassador,who was a representative of Tesla’s estate.Even though the FBI knew that Tesla had publicly said he’d perfected his deathray – there was no independent verification of this – no steps had been taken bythe government to prevent him from transferring his plans for the death ray to aforeign power. Vice President Henry Wallace told the FBI that the government hada critical interest in whatever papers Tesla had and instructed the FBI to seizethem any way they could.That was why the FBI directed the Office of Alien Property to enter Tesla’shotel room on January 9, 1943, and take possession. Tesla’s other papers thatwere already in a storage warehouse were seized by the OAP as well.Over the next several weeks in January 1943, after a flurry of diplomaticactivity between the Yugoslavian embassy and J. Edgar Hoover’s office, the FBIturned the entire matter over to the Office of Alien Property, which also wantedto get out from under the diplomatic tug of war between Belgrade and the StateDepartment. The OAP, still reacting to the vice president’s instructions thatpapers that could give aid to the enemy could not leave the country, contactedthe chairman of what would become the Office of R&D, the National DefenseResearch Committee of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr.John Trump. Dr. Trump examined the papers, determined that not much of them wereuseful, but decided to make photocopies of a number of papers Tesla wrote duringthe years preceding his death.Trump also wrote abstracts of those papers, which included an undated monographby Nikola Tesla entitled “New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-DispersiveEnergy through Natural Media,” Tesla’s description of how he would generate anddirect a high energy beam of electrons at a target. Though dismissed by Trump asunworkable, the paper nevertheless described Tesla’s latest thinking about adirected energy weapon, the accelerated particle beam device.With the OAP’s making photographs and abstracts of Tesla’s papers, the entireTesla property remained in storage until it was sent back to Belgrade in the1950s. That should have put an end to the matter. However, in 1945, just afterthe war ended, the Air Technical Service Command at Wright Field outside ofDayton, Ohio, sought copies of the Tesla papers from the Office of AlienProperty in Washington and sent a military courier to take possession of themand bring them back to Wright. Although there was some correspondence betweenthe OAP and the Air Technical Service Command over the next two years regardingthe disposition of the papers, at least one of Gen.Nathan Twining’s officers at the Air Materiel Command contacted the Office ofAlien Property in November1947 to tell them that the AMC at Wright Field hadpossession of the Tesla papers and would maintain possession of them at leastuntil after January 1, 1948. Thereafter, the papers, including Tesla’s ownmonograph on his accelerated particle beam weapon, seem to have completelydisappeared.What is interesting about all of this is that according to the late Col. WilliamCorso, in his book The Day After Roswell, photostatic copies of photographs ofTesla’s papers were in the possession of the Army Research and Development’sForeign Technology desk when he took over in 1961.Corso wrote that at least one other copy of Tesla’s monograph had remained inthe possession of the working group under General Twining and had made its wayto the Advanced Research Projects Agency in Washington over the course of thenext ten years. It was pulled out when the working group realized that upon thelaunch of Sputnik, the United States had absolutely no defense against war inspace being initiated by the Russians, nor against extraterrestrials who werepiloting UFOs.Corso stated that there was one vital clue; the only possible process that couldinterfere with the electromagnetic field drive that supposedly the aliens wereusing, was a directed particle beam weapon. This device would disrupt theelectromagnetic wave formation around the spacecraft and penetrate theantigravity field. Because the accelerated particle weapon carried with it apowerful electromagnetic pulse, the effect of this EMP – the same effect thatEMPs have on any electrical equipment – was to disrupt the antigravity gravityfield by destroying the integrity of the electromagnetic wave of the spacecraft.In this way, without exploding the spacecraft, the particle beam could force itto crash by destroying its ability to counter gravity.Tesla understood that the particle beam weapon was just like a bolt oflightning, with very much the same destructive power only much more controlled.A lightning bolt is a massive beam of electrons. Scientists have theorized thatyou can achieve the same destructive force with a beam of protons. Still otherscientists have argued that because electrons carry a negative charge andprotons a positive charge, they are vulnerable to distortion within the earth’smagnetic field because the beam will either be attracted to the opposite chargeor repelled by the same charge. In addition, a beam of like particles willcontain a natural dispersive force because the like charges in the beam willrepel each other.The irony, according to Corso, has always been in the confluence between thehistoric work and discoveries of Nikola Tesla and the technology that wasascertained the extraterrestrials had developed from evaluation of the Roswellwreckage. Tesla had experimented with wireless transmission of energy, and theextraterrestrials seemed to have employed a type of wireless transmission ofenergy for navigational and defensive purposes. Tesla wrote about the theoriesbehind the distortion or manipulation of a gravitational field through thepropagation of electromagnetic waves, and the extraterrestrials seemed to haveemployed just that kind of technology for a propulsion system.As well, Tesla’s descriptions of the theories behind the death ray he claimed tohave perfected ultimately became the basis for the defensive weapons deployed tochallenge the hostile intrusions of the planet’s airspace by theextraterrestrials. What posed a threat to us at Roswell and what we eventuallylearned from Tesla’s writings became two confluent streams of scientific theorythat eventually became the basis of the Strategic Defense Initiative, anantiballistic missile and space vehicle weapon.These roots go back to the vision of Tesla and to what scientists believed to beactual pieces of directed energy technology that was pulled out of the crashedspace vehicle at Roswell, reports about which turned up in the nut file cartedinto Corso’s office in the Pentagon in 1961 from the Pentagon basement.STOPPING TECHNOLOGY IN ITS TRACKSIt is no surprise that Tesla's ideas on alternative energies are currently beingsuppressed. There has been a decade's old conspiracy to keep off the market newand innovative technologies (even old technologies as envisioned by Tesla) thatthreaten the fossil fuel monopoly. With those truly innovative inventions theconspiracy is made even easier by simply debunking the technology by labeling it“perpetual motion” – a guaranteed killer of new and better devices that couldend the nation's dependence of Middle East oil.The 21st century has seen a substantial rise in oil and gas prices in the UnitedStates. Meanwhile, there is now a better understanding within the general publicthat our use of oil from certain parts of the world is actually sending dollarsto enrich the very terrorist organizations that now threaten the Western world.Because of this, there is a renewed interest in developing new and differentapproaches for energy.However, in the U.S., the government in Washington D.C. is heavily dependent onthe millions of dollars contributed by big oil. There is little chance thatanything that can come close to knocking petroleum off its pedestal will ever beallowed to develop. There are some challengers, but they are just shadows ofpossibilities compared to some of the mind-blowing technologies that have beendeveloped, and then silenced by a conspiracy whose purpose is to keep freeenergy out of our hands.TOO LITTLE TOO LATEEthanol is now being touted as the new energy source to help free us from theshackles of fossil fuels. By using domestically grown corn, numerous bigcompanies are investing millions of dollars to build processing plants allacross the nation in the hope of cashing in on the next big energy wave. Aftergas prices in the U.S. rose to over $5.00 a gallon in 2008, ethanol looked evenmore attractive.However, ethanol is by no means an effective remedy to bring down the soaringprice of gasoline. In fact, it is merely a distraction to prop up the continuingdominance of big oil and steer attention away from clean, cheap, new energysources that are available to us right now.Prices for ethanol in the United States recently hit an all-time high at over$3.00 a gallon. To hinder competition from ethanol, the oil companies havearranged for the U.S. to impose a $0.54 cent per gallon tariff on ethanolimports, which keeps prices for the alternative biofuel artificially high.Brazil, which recently became energy self-sufficient in 2006, is the world'slargest producer of sugar-based ethanol and would benefit greatly from a tariffreduction in the United States. Apparently it is cheaper and more energyefficient to produce ethanol from sugar cane than corn.The current interest in finding new energy sources is simply too little and toolate. In the 1970s, during the Carter administration, the U.S. government helpedfund many important studies with the goal of finding and developing new energy.President Carter even went as far as having solar panels installed at the WhiteHouse in order to show that his administration was serious about getting us awayfrom the 19th century dependence of producing energy by burning things.Unfortunately, when Ronald Reagan came into office, he showed his disdain fornew technology, and his love for big oil money, by putting a stop on all fundingand research into alternative energies. He even had the solar panels taken downfrom the White House. Energy crisis? What energy crisis?Because of this shortsightedness, and the allure of big oil politicalcontributions, the U.S. lost the potential for 30 years of research into findingand developing new energy sources. Now, once again, we find ourselves facing theprospect of soaring gas and home heating prices. We have no one to blame butourselves for allowing our elected officials to bury their heads in the sandwhen it comes to our dependence on oil.Not only that, but we have our government to blame for the current threat ofterrorism that dominates our thoughts and headlines today. Every dollar that bigoil has used to bribe our politicians to keep oil and gas as our dominate energysource is quadrupled in profits that come out of our pockets and into thecoffers of terrorists. Every time we fill up our SUVs and Hummers, we arethrowing money at al-Qaida, and paying for the bombs used against us – all atthe approval of your friendly representatives in Washington DC.What is devastating about the current energy crisis is the fact that none of itever had to happen. Our soaring gas prices, 9/11, the war on terrorism, and theinvasion of Iraq – none of it would have occurred if certain technologies wouldhave been allowed to be properly developed and put on the market. Unfortunately,there is a long and sordid history of threats, suppression, cover-ups and evenmurder to keep alternative and free energy technology from getting into thehands of the public.A perfect example of the suppression of alternatives to big oil is the electriccar. Oil companies have prevented the development and sale of entirely electriccars by restricting the availability of high capacity batteries. General Motorsfirst bought the rights to NiMH batteries from Toyota and Panasonic, and thensold those patents to oil giant Texaco, which then merged with Chevron. Chevronthen used its patent to kill Toyota's RAV4-EV electric car program.A similar program - for a car called the EV1 - was also underway at GM. Cleancars from the automaker could have been sold for $25,000 each. Instead, GMrecalled all EV1's, took them away from their owners and then crushed andshredded them, sending the remains to the foundry. GM's justification for thiswas that \"no one wanted electric cars.\"Beyond the electric car we have William Bolon, who in 1971 developed an unusualsteam engine design that was said to get up to 50 miles to the gallon. Theengine used only 17 moving parts and weighed less than 50 pounds. It eliminatedthe usual transmission and drive train in an automobile.After his invention was featured in newspapers and television news, theinventor's factory was fire bombed with damages totaling $600,000. No one wasever arrested in connection to the crime. Letters to the White House wereignored so the inventor finally gave up and let Indonesian interests have thedesign.LIVES THREATENED, INNOVATION SQUASHEDIn his book Free Energy Pioneer: John Worrell Keely, author Theo Paijmansdetails the life of the American inventor John Keely, who in the 19th centuryexperimented with sonic vibrations that vaporized water instantly into energy.He named this energy etheric force. Although Keely successfully demonstratedmachinery that used this principal, he was attacked by so-called reputable menof the scientific establishment who ridiculed and downgraded his efforts,calling him a fraud and a liar when they had not even extended him the courtesyof attending a demonstration.Unfortunately, this would not be the last time that forward-looking researchersand scientists would be subject to ridicule and humiliation at the hands ofthose who seek to keep innovation suppressed.In 1940, it was alleged that Henry T. Moray demonstrated before the members ofthe Public Utilities Commission in Utah his [non-thermodynamic] free energygenerator that gave a continuous output of 250,000 volts with no apparent [coalcorporation hegemony] input. The next day he was found shot in his lab and allof his notes and the device were stolen.Ron Brandt is the inventor of the perm-mag motor. When Brandt was a young man,he invented a 90-mpg carburetor. He claims that he was paid a visit by two menfrom Standard Oil and two men wearing U.S. Marshal’s uniforms. The men toldBrandt that if he ever made another carburetor, they would kill him, his wife,and two young children. He was quickly persuaded that his life wasn't worth a“damn”carburetor.Brandt was able to memorize the badge numbers of the two Marshals and had anattorney in Washington, DC check with the U.S. Marshal's office. Incredibly,they had no record of the two badge numbers.During the 1950's, Phil Stone, a retired Florida college physics professor,received a patent for a device to run an engine on water. The U.S. governmentthen classified his patent and this prevented him from developing his device.Frank Richardson worked during the late 1960s as an electrician at the NevadaTest Site. During the 1970s, four other NTS technicians helped Richardson inventand patent a magnet-based electrical generator which required no input and abladeless steam turbine that appears to have been a variation of a Teslabladeless turbine. A Volkswagen Beetle was outfitted with the two devices anddriven around without energy input.Two of the technicians died under suspicious circumstances, the invention wasalmost stolen, and Richardson had to go into hiding until his recent death.Nothing more was ever heard from Richardson's invention.In 2006, a technician who was one of a team of garage experimentersinvestigating a hydrogen-ondemand technology was run off the road near a ruralintersection in Ventura County, California, and accosted by four white,middle-aged males in black suits, carrying guns.The victim in this incident is an associate of New Energy Congress member KenRasmussen, who had been working together with him on the project. Strangely, aday before the incident, a person who was interested in funding Rasmussen'sproject, and who had been trying to reach him since November, had finally madecontact.Rasmussen reported that, using information which could only have been obtainedby monitoring digital cell phones and e-mail, the assailants threatened thevictim that they had total control over his personal life. He was told to remainsilent and not to talk to government authorities. He was told that if he did notcomply, a family member would be killed. The assailants produced extensivedetails about this target family member. The threat also included himself, hisfamily and all associates if he did not stop work on the process immediately.The threats made actually applied broadly to anyone working on overunity.“I'm breaking the story to warn others who might be involved in similartechnologies,” said Rasmussen. “Our lives have been directly threatened. Allprogress is stopped for now.”Also in 2006, after announcing that he had successfully built a truck that runson Joe Cell technology, drawing energy from water and Orgone, Bill Williams saidhe was approached by two men who demanded that he stop his research, threateninghim with dire consequences if he didn't.The Joe Cell is said to draw on Orgone energy. The fairly simple device useselectrically charged water as the “gate” or medium through which the aethericenergy is drawn from the surroundings and transferred to the automobile engine.Williams was approached on April 6, 2006 by two men who told him that theywanted him to stop working on all forms of alternative energy. They also statedthat they knew everything about Williams, his family and all his projects pastand present.“At about that time the passenger reached over and held up a file that was abouttwo or so inches thick,\" Williams said. \"He opened it up and showed me telephonetranscripts, emails, messages from the groups that I had belonged to.”They knew where Williams’ children worked, the times they were at work; also hiswife's working hours, grandkids' school, etc. They knew everything.One man then opened up the left side of his jacket and showed his weapon thatwas holstered. The two men said that if Williams did not stop working on thisthat there would be other consequences. He also stated that he wanted Williamsto post that he was no longer working in this field and to destroy his work,i.e. Cells, Drawings, Lab Journals, everything.After a few days of contemplation, Williams decided to abide by the demands ofthose who threatened him. He destroyed the cell and all data and documentationand disabled the website on which he had posted plans. Four days after thatincident, Bill wrote the following message to the group:“I thought I was strong but when illness to the family comes into play, I havefailed. I am truly sorry. I will not be working in any form of alternativeenergy field anymore. I destroyed my device tonight along with my written dataand lab notes as per specked out.”A THREAT TO BIG OILFormer U.S. Patent Examiner Thomas Valone, who was fired for producing aconference in Washington DC on new energy technologies, claims that there is avault at the U.S. Patent Office containing thousands of patents. These patentswere ordered secret by the government and confiscated from the inventors who arethreatened with 20 years in jail if they release the information as per\"dualuse\" secrecy law.The U.S. Patent Office has a nine-member committee that screens patents fornational security implications. A hidden purpose of this committee is also toscreen energy-related patents that could threaten the power and fossil fuelcompanies.Free energy technology is here, right now. It has been here for decades. Theveil of secrecy has finally been torn away thanks to the Internet and otherforms of modern communication. People all over the world are starting to buildfree energy devices for their own use. Big oil and the governments that theycontrol do not want this to happen and will do anything to stop it once and forall. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we take action and wrest controlaway from the power-brokers that keep us all subjugated under the weight oftheir massive thumb. Only when we are free to develop and utilize new energytechnologies, without the threat of physical violence, will the world be able togrow, develop and reach for the stars as a united humanity.[Image00011.gif]CHAPTER TWELVE NAZI FLYING DISCS AND TESLA TECHNOLOGYI have been fascinated for quite some time about the theory that Nazi Germanyhad built disc-shaped aircraft that looked suspiciously like the modern UFO.Ancient writings and art throughout history show that strange flying objectshave been seen in our skies for centuries. However, in 1947 sightings of UFOsincreased to such an extent that the phenomenon was impossible to ignore. Anumber of engineers, scientists and laborers who had survived the war read thenews reports and saw the compelling photographs and realized that these strangethings being seen all over the planet looked very much like the top-secretaircraft they had helped develop for the Nazis. A few, like Renato Vesco, whowas a fully licensed aircraft engineer and a specialist in aerospace and ramjetdevelopments, came forward with their story but were met with intenseskepticism.It didn't seem possible, most people thought, that Nazi Germany was capable ofdeveloping such incredible aircraft. Yet the story persisted, made even moreplausible when other top-secret projects that had been researched and developedby the Nazi's were uncovered. German scientists were working on atomic bombs,orbital missiles, sonic weapons, death rays, the wireless transmission of energyetc. Considering how far ahead these scientific minds were compared to the restof the world, a German-built flying saucer does not seem so implausible.One aspect that I have been researching since the original publication of thisbook (2000) is the possibility that Nazi scientists may have been helped byresearch notes stolen from Nikola Tesla by Nazi spies. It is no secret thatbefore and during WWII, New York City had several enclaves of Nazi spies thatmanaged to ferret out of the U.S. all sorts of important information; some ofthis may have been Tesla's research papers on his “field propulsion”experiments.As was discussed in chapter six, not much is known on how Tesla may haveproceeded with his discoveries. In his Oct. 15, 1911 interview with the New YorkHerald Tribune, he gave vague descriptions of how he hoped to utilize his fieldpropulsion theory.“The flying machine of the future - my flying machine - will be heavier thanair, but it will not be an aero-plane. It will have no wings. It will besubstantial, solid, stable. You might see it on the ground and you would neverguess that it was a flying machine. Yet it will be able to move at will throughthe air in any direction with perfect safety, at higher speeds than have yetbeen reached, regardless of weather and oblivious of 'holes in the air' ordownward currents...It can remain absolutely stationary in the air, even in awind, for a great length of time. Its lifting power will not depend upon anysuch delicate devices as the bird has to employ, but upon positive mechanicalaction. The application of this principle will give the world a flying machineunlike anything that has ever been suggested before. It will have no planes, noscrew propellers or devices of any kind hitherto used. It will be small andcompact, excessively swift, and, above all, perfectly safe in the greateststorm. It can be built of any size and can carry any weight that may bedesired.”At PESWiki.com, in a section titled Tesla's Flying Machine, the author writesthat there are different speculations around the development of Tesla'saircraft. Through his collected articles and lectures, there are references tothe development of an “ideal” flying machine. This machine first appears similarto the modern day lifters propulsion system, but some propose that Tesla'sdevice differs because it is comprised of both the high voltage “carrierexchange blocking” frequencies and high voltage direct current brush“propellant.”Tesla's rotating magnetic field “alternator,” coupled with his bladeless turbineand his high voltage coils, was perfectly appropriate for this purpose. He tookhis first step with his rotating magnetic field and understood intuitively thatthe laws of electromagnetism were somehow connected to gravity; the passage fromGoethe's Faust clearly spells it out. On that occasion, he not only solved hisrotating magnetic field problem, but took the first step into understanding“nature's wheelwork.”The “veritable rope of air” he refers to in one of his interviews was a directanalogy to the aether carriers bringing in \"tubes of force\" to maintain hisflying machine exactly where he wanted it or to move it in any direction atincredible speed and acceleration. It is important to understand Tesla's life asa whole, not only to simply study and interpret his works as simple isolatedevents. He was continuously busy with further developing his theories andbringing them into practice and would not be satisfied until he reached apractical status.There was some discussion in chapter six as to how Tesla's electric propulsionresearch was based on what is now known as electrokinetics and electrogravitics.Electrogravitics is physically interpreted as giving the forces on materialobjects (which may also be acted upon by other physical forces). Electrostaticlevitation is the process of using an electric field to lift a charged objectand counteract the effects of gravity. Plasmagnetic levitation technology, whichinvolves using high frequency radiant energy to turn air into a column ofconductive plasma used to repel against a craft, resulting in a form oflevitation, may also be in use here.NAZI ESPIONAGE AND TESLA TECHNOLOGYIt seems unlikely that Tesla ever managed to get his aircraft theories off paperand into actual construction. However, this story doesn't die along with Tesla'scherished ideas. I think that there is a good possibility that the Germansactually created a field propulsion aircraft near the end of World War II andthe basic concepts and designs for these craft came from research notes stolenfrom Tesla by a New York/East Coast based spy ring.Before the U.S. entered the European war, German agents were definitely prowlingthe U.S. East Coast. Six months before World War II began, the FBI arrested 33German spies in New York City. Called the \"Duquesne Spy Ring,\" after CommanderFritz Duquesne, German spies were placed in key occupations to get informationthat could be used in the event of war and to be ready for acts of sabotage. Oneperson started up a restaurant to filter out information from the customers;another spy worked at an airline to report Allied ships crossing the ocean;others worked as delivery people so they could communicate secret messages.Without a doubt, there were other undetected Nazi spy rings that were firmlyentrenched, especially in large cities such as New York and Philadelphia. Thepurpose of these espionage outfits was to seek out new and innovativetechnologies that could be sent back to benefit the Nazi war machine. There haveeven been some allegations that a longtime business associate of Tesla, GeorgeH. Scherff, Sr., was actually stealing Tesla's research papers to sell to theGerman government.William R. Lyne, author of the book Space Aliens From the Pentagon, alleges thatUFOs are not spacecraft from other planets, but in reality are manmadeaircraft/spacecraft based on Nikola Tesla's original theories. Lyne says thatthe secret propulsion of the saucers comes from Tesla's Dynamic Theory ofGravity, which was completed by Tesla in 1893-94, but never published. Tesla'sDynamic Theory of Gravity is still classified by the U.S. government, because inthe theory lies the secrets of the electro-propulsive technology. The Germansacquired the electro-propulsive technology of Tesla as early as 1934 andimmediately set about trying to develop this new science to construct newweapons of mass destruction. However, it appears that even though Tesla wascorrect in his theories of gravity and field propulsion, building an aircraftthat would actually work using those principles was an entirely differentmatter.German scientists and engineers were unprepared for such an advanced science asformulated by Tesla. Another problem was that Tesla's notes were lacking in alot of the extensive detail that was needed to build working models. Tesla knewwhat he needed to make his inventions work and his assistants would try to getas much of these details down on paper, but Tesla would work at such a rapidpace that often small, yet critical, details would get left out. It was notuntil close to the end of the war that Nazi engineers were able to test theirfirst, crude prototypes. Even then, it is likely that these scientists still didnot have a good grasp on what they were working on.SECRET NAZI FLYING DISCSThe story behind the Nazi Flying Discs is extremely convoluted. A number ofdifferent scientists and engineers all claim to have worked on different flyingdisc designs with different types of propulsion systems. Flugkapitän RudolfSchriever came up with the idea of a \"Flugkreisel\" (Flight Gyro) that waspowered by developing turbojet technology.Viktor Schauberger, an Austrian forester who observed the effects of nature,especially of water, developed a revolutionary vortex motor in 1940 called theRepulsin(e), roughly translated as “Repulsor.” The first model, the Repulsin A,was a colloidal disc motor that utilized air and water contained in a coppercasing to produce a mini-tornado, or vortex, inside the machine that causedlevitation at some point.BMW started development of its own versions of the new \"disc-fan\" technologycalled the Flügelrad, which was powered by two BMW 003 jet engines located inthe lower body side-by-side. The Flügelrad layout was of a central body housingthat could hold two pilots covered by a hemispheric dome surrounded by a discblade rotor. During the early 1940s Dr. Richard Miethe produced many differentFlugscheiben (Flight Disc) designs for the SS in a concentrated effort toimprove or replace Rudolf Schriever's failing disc-fan Flugkreisel prototype. Hewas not alone, as Schriever's original design was handed over to Dr. Miethe,Klaus Habermohl, Dr. Giuseppe Belluzzo, and six other unnamed engineers - allproducing several radical designs based on the emerging engine technologies. Butperhaps the most unorthodox propulsion system yet incorporated into one ofMiethe's designs was based on the work of Austrian physicist Dr. Karl Nowak,which involved oxygen and nitrogen. The power plant being tested burned nothingbut air. The scientists achieved this by building a reciprocating engine whichused atmospheric oxygen to oxidize atmospheric nitrogen.Very intense electrical voltage sparks were needed to produce temperatures near50,000 degrees within the combustion chamber - with the same natural effect aslightning. The air engine also injected super-cold helium directly into thecombustion chamber for the dual purpose of cooling the chamber and also causinga tremendous expansion during heating, thus aiding in the driving force of theengine itself. This design, which Bruno Schwenteit patented postwar, was claimedto be the Miethe-Schriever disc so often labeled the mystery secret weapon V-7.Schwenteit also claimed the disc was actually constructed during World War II.Another version of this complex story says that Dr. Miethe found the solutionwhen word came of Schauberger's completion of the Repulsin B model discoid motorin 1943 with its radical vortex propulsion system that could be reasonablyenlarged into a manned disc of incredible power.Work proceeded right away and by April 1944 the Miethe craft constructed inBreslau took off for flight tests over the Baltic. It was reported to Hitler onApril 17, 1944 by the SS that the Miethe disc had successfully flown.Viktor Schauberger stated after the war that he worked at the Mauthausenconcentration camp directing technically oriented prisoners and Germanscientists in the successful construction of a saucer-shaped aircraft, “The‘flying saucer’ which was flight-tested on the 19th February 1945 near Pragueand which attained a height of 15,000 meters in three minutes and a horizontalspeed of 2,200 km/hours (1,366mph), was constructed according to a Model 1 builtat Mauthausen concentration camp in collaboration with the first-classstress-analyst and propulsion engineers assigned to me there.”Schriever's original Flugkreisel was reported to have flown in February 1945where it attained a top speed of 1,300 mph and a climb to 45,000 ft. in twominutes. BMW's Flügelrads by comparison could barely get off the ground, werehighly unstable, and made frequent “hard” landings. Only one Flügelrad II V-2(or V-3) finally achieved powered level flight in April 1945 just before all theFlügelrads and Schriever's Flugkreisel were destroyed in the Russian advance.IN SEARCH OF “THE LEGEND”Even though the Nazi theory for the origin of manmade disc-shaped aircraft isoften treated with considerable derision by UFO researchers and skeptics alike,Nick Cook, an editor for Jane's Defence Weekly, treats the subject with greatrespect in his ground-breaking book Hunt for Zero Point. Cook's book is apersonal chronicle, summarizing in anecdotal fashion his own personal researchinto American anti-gravity projects – a \"hunt\" as he calls it – that quickly ledhim to an unsuspected source: Nazi Germany. Cook recounted how many of the bestreports of \"foo fighters\" or UFOs during the war were submitted by the 415thNight Fighter Squadron and occurred in a triangle over southern Germany fromFrankfurt-am-Main, Metz, and Strasbourg in the year 1944.Cook then describes his discovery of the book that gave birth to the legend,German Major Rudolf Lusar's German Secret Weapons of World War Two, “Seekingclues to the foo-fighter mystery, I discovered a copy in the reading room of theImperial War Museum. In it, Lusar described in meticulous detail, in languagethat often made the depths of his bitterness clear, the technical achievementsof ‘a small, industrious and honest nation which lost the war.’“Secret Weapons made somber reading. Although German technical achievements werevisible in developments such as the V-l flying bomb, a direct forerunner of themodern-day cruise missile, and the V-2 ballistic missile, it was the vast extentof Germany's underpinning technology base, as revealed by Lusar, which showedjust how far ahead of the Allies the Nazis had been in certain key areas.“Jet engines, rocket engines, infrared and thermal-imaging systems, proximityfuses, missiles guidance seekers.... technologies that are integral to mostmodern aircraft and airborne weapon systems were all listed and described. Inthe late 1950s, when Lusar's book first appeared, these technologies were stillin their infancy in Britain and America.“Yet the Germans had been working on them a decade and a half earlier. However,there was another side to the book, one that was so sensational that immediatelyon its appearance it had set alarm bells ringing in Washington. This side of thebook related to so-called German ‘wonderweapons’ beyond the V-l and V-2....Other esoteric developments detailed by Lusar showed that the Germans had beenworking on bringing down Allied aircraft with sound waves, air vortices, andintensely focused beams of light and jets of compressed air.“In 1958, the US Air Force commissioned a ‘special studies group’ within AirForce Intelligence headed by an Austrian-born technical consultant called DrStefan Possony to carry out a detailed appraisal of Lusar's book. The researcheffort was branded 'secret' and has only recently come to light....“A section in Lusar's book was devoted to ‘flying saucers,’ which he asserted,in no uncertain terms, were the product of German wartime inventors. ‘Expertsand collaborators in this work confirm that the first projects, called flyingdisks, were undertaken in 1941,’ Lusar wrote. He even went on to name the keyindividuals involved. These were ‘the German experts Schriever, Habermohl, andMiethe, and the Italian Bellonzo.’”Cook discovered that antigravity research had been conducted by Germanscientists working under the command of General Hans Kammelar. At a then secretlocation near Wenceslas, Poland, the Nazis constructed a test-platform toinvestigate cutting edge applications of physics and theoretical phenomenaconceptualized in both Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity and Einstein's UnifiedField Theory.A device used in the experiments was known as the “Nazi Bell” device, and modernspeculation by John Deering, a U.S. scientist and engineer working on currentadvanced projects, indicates that the German WWII research was intended tocreate a powerful propulsion effect by engineering applications of Tesla'sequations.Within Tesla and Einstein's theories, there is a link between the “vectormagnetic potential” and torsion. Put simply, the effects of curved space-time(resulting from a massive body, like the Earth) can be locally offset bycreating “Torsion.” Thus, using Tesla's gravitational theory, electromagneticinteractions are harnessed to induce torsion, which in turn can then null outgravitation. The result is a sort of counteraction to gravity or “antigravity”field.THE NAZI BELL“The Nazi-Bell device consisted of two counter-rotating cylindrical containers.The containers, which were positioned one above the other, measuredapproximately 1-meter in diameter and were filled with cryogenically cooled andfrozen Mercury metal. There was a frozen core of a metallic paste, which servedas a ‘high permeability material’ for the EMG (electromagnetic-gravitational)field.” Nick Cook, Hunt for Zero Point.Reportedly, the project was considered by the Nazis as of such importance thatit was security classified as \"War decisive,\" as important as their research todevelop an atomic bomb. Cook also noted that the Bell apparently required highamounts of electrical power in its operation, something that Tesla was wellaware of during his original experiments.During use, the Bell could only be run for approximately one to two minutes, asit apparently gave off strong radiation and/or other electromagnetic or unknownfield effects. Because of this high electromagnetic radiation, severalscientists died on its first operation. Subsequent tests included various plantsand animals, all of which decomposed into a blackish goo and without normalputrefaction within a matter of a few minutes or hours after exposure to itsfield effects when in operation. Technicians near the Bell during theseexperiments reported metallic tastes in their mouths after being exposed to it,something that Tesla also reported in his research. I think that it is alsointeresting that, later in his life, Tesla developed mental problems that mayhave been a direct result of his overexposure to the powerful electromagneticfields he was working with to develop field propulsion. However, unlike the Naziscientists who died quickly from their exposure, Tesla knew how to ground andprotect himself against the powerful electrical fields, but the cumulativeeffects may have finally caused permanent brain damage.All the scientists and witnesses who saw or worked on the Bell were allegedlymurdered by the SS as the war neared its end. The Bell was transplanted out ofSilesia, Poland, to a destination that has never been discovered. The Bell,along with General Kammler himself, simply disappeared entirely from history,never to be seen again. It is believed, however, that both the Bell and GeneralKammler were transported by U-boat to a location outside of the Reich. Someresearchers have even theorized that Kammler defected to the Allied Forces andcontinued his work in secret for the U.S.FLYING DISC TECHNOLOGY LEAVES GERMANYIn my book, Adm. Byrd's Secret Journey Beyond the Poles (2008, GlobalCommunications), I provide evidence that the Nazi Bell, along with severalworking prototype aircraft, were sent to the secret Nazi base 211 in Antarctica.In addition, the U.S. military must have also discovered a working fieldpropulsion aircraft (or several), and were able to replicate their constructionusing some of the “lost journals” of Tesla that had been confiscated when theinventor died. According to FOIA documents, the U.S. started their fieldpropulsion research at Wright Airbase near Dayton, Ohio. However, the scientistsworking on this cutting edge technology were shocked when it was discovered thata flying disc had crashed in the desert of New Mexico in 1947. This disc (andothers that crashed later) were found to be of Nazi origin and operated byGermans who had escaped from Europe to secret locations in South America andAntarctica.A September 14, 2000 news release by Reuters states that according to a newlydeclassified U.S. intelligence document, Nazi leaders met top Germanindustrialists to plan a secret postwar international network to restore them topower when they realized that they were losing the war in 1944.The document says an SS general and a representative of the German armamentsministry told such companies as Krupp and Roehling that they must be prepared tofinance the Nazi party after the war when it went underground. They were alsotold “existing financial reserves in foreign countries must be placed at thedisposal of the party so that a strong German empire can be created after thedefeat.” The document, detailing an August 1944 meeting, was obtained from theWorld Jewish Congress, which has been working with the Senate Banking Committeeand the Holocaust Museum to determine what happened to looted Jewish money inthe Second World War.Because of the probe, thousands of documents from “Operation Safe Haven” weremade public. The operation was a U.S. intelligence effort to track how theGerman government used Swiss banks during the war to hide looted Jewish assets.The three-page document, released by the National Archives, was sent fromSupreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force to the U.S. secretary ofstate in November 1944. It described a secret meeting at the Maison Rouge inStrasbourg, occupied France, on August 10, 1944.The source for the report was an agent who attended and “had worked for theFrench on German problems since 1916.” Jeffrey Bale, a Columbia Universityexpert on clandestine Nazi networks, said historians have debated whether such ameeting could have taken place because it came a month after the attempt onAdolph Hitler's life, which had led to a crackdown on discussions of a possibleGerman military defeat. Bale said the Red House meeting was mentioned in Nazihunter Simon Wiesenthal's 1967 book The Murderers Among Us and again in a 1978book by French Communist Victor Alexandrov, The SS Mafia.A U.S. Treasury Department analysis in 1946 reported that the Germans hadtransferred $500 million out of the country before the war's end to countriessuch as Spain, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Portugal, Argentina and Turkey whereit was used to buy hundreds of companies. “As soon as the (Nazi) party becomesstrong enough to reestablish its control over Germany, the industrialists willbe paid for their efforts and cooperation by concessions and orders,” theintelligence document said.The meeting was presided over by a “Dr. Scheid,” described as an SS Obergruppenführer (general) and director of Hermsdorff & Schonburg Company. Attending wererepresentatives of seven German companies including Krupp, Roehling,Messerschmidt, and Volkswagenwerk and officials of the ministries of armamentsand the navy.The industrialists were from companies with extensive interests in France andScheid is quoted as saying the battle for France was lost and “from nowon...German industry must realize that the war cannot be won and it must takesteps in preparation for a postwar commercial campaign.”He said German industry must make contacts and alliances with foreign firms andlay the groundwork for borrowing considerable sums in foreign countries. Hecited the Krupp Company's sharing of patents with U.S. companies so that theywould have to work with Krupp. A representative of the armaments ministry thenpresided over a smaller second meeting with Scheid and representatives of Kruppand Roehling, who were told the war was lost and would continue only until theunity of Germany was guaranteed. He said they must prepare themselves to financethe Nazi party when it went underground.The intelligence report added that the meetings signaled a new Nazi policywhereby industrialists with government assistance will export as much of theircapital as possible. Sybil Milton, senior historian at Washington's HolocaustMuseum, said it has long been known that the Nazis planned to do something afterthe war and the document's importance may be in pointing researchers in adirection where they could determine what had been done.Researchers long before the release of this document had already been followingthe tracks left by the fleeing Nazis. These tracks led all across the globe,into the United States, South America and into Antarctica.From this point on, the story becomes difficult to trace because of thedisinformation campaign produced by the CIA to the effect that UFOs areextraterrestrial in origin. However, it is clear that at least some UFOs, orflying-disc aircraft, are manmade using technology whose origins can be directlytraced back to Nikola Tesla. Given that, as a scientist, Tesla was so againstwar, and had sincerely tried to use his inventions for the betterment ofhumanity, it is disheartening to think how his greatest ideas have been takenand used by the very same types of men that confounded Tesla throughout hislife.[Image00012.gif]CONCLUSIONSSince the time this book was originally released in 2000, Dale Alfrey has becomefrustrated by the lack of progress on the discovery of new “lost” Tesla notes.He still feels that somewhere there exists additional papers and notes, perhapsforgotten in someone’s basement or attic. Alfrey has spent a number of hoursscouring the Internet seeking people who may have the information he is lookingfor. Unfortunately, nothing substantial has yet been found and Alfrey has mostlyabandoned his research.It is certain that other missing Tesla documents are still “out theresomewhere.” According to the book: Tesla—Man Out of Time, in 1928, Tesla’sfriend, John O’Neill happened to see a legal advertisement in a New Yorknewspaper announcing that six boxes placed in storage by Tesla would be sold bythe storage warehouse for unpaid bills. Feeling that such material should bepreserved, O’Neill went to Tesla and asked permission to try and obtain funds toreclaim the material.“Tesla hit the ceiling,” he recalled. “He assured me he was well able to takecare of his own affairs. He forbid me to buy them or do anything in any wayabout them.”Shortly after the inventor died, O’Neill got in touch with Sava Kosanovic, toldhim about the boxes, and urged him to protect them. He was never able to get apositive statement from Kosanovic that he had obtained the boxes and examinedthe contents. “He gave evasive assurances that there was no reason for me toworry.”Despite the incomplete notes that Tesla left behind, it is fairly certain whycertain agencies, both within the U.S. and in other countries, have so ferventlysought whatever notes and research papers Tesla left behind. Some of these noteswere Tesla's work in vertical take off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, strangedrawings of unusual vehicles, reactive jet dirigibles and hovercraft and alsocombination helicopter/airplanes that the inventor designed. Clearly, Tesla isone of the forefathers of both the Harrier jet, which can hover and take offvertically, and the Osprey helicopter airplane.After his initial Colorado Springs experiments in 1899, Tesla startedexperimenting with better radio transmitters and receivers in order to repeathis reception of the anomalous signals he picked up in Colorado. Teslaconsidered his methods of reception and transmission utilized not Hertzianwaves, or what we now refer to as transverse electromagnetic waves (radio), butanother type of signal transmission. He described them as faster than light(FTL) longitudinal wave transmissions. Tesla may have been receiving on the ELFspectrum (Extremely Low Frequencies). The ELF spectrum is below the 10 KHz.boundary of internationally regulated frequencies. It is usually considered tobe the spectrum of 3 Hz. to 30 Hz. (VLF 3 to 30 KHz) (ULF 300 to 3000 Hz) (ELF 3to 300Hz). The wavelengths in the ELF range are from 100,000 Km. to 1,000 Km.and the wavelength for the Earth's 40,000 Kms. circumference falls within thatspread.Tesla obviously succeeded to such a degree that he was soon receiving voicetransmissions. These transmissions he speculated were originating from people onother worlds. Tesla gave a few public hints about these interplanetarytransmissions, such as in 1937, he announced: “I have devoted much of my timeduring the year past to the perfecting of a new small and compact apparatus bywhich energy in considerable amounts can now be flashed through interstellarspace to any distance without the slightest dispersion.” (New York Times,Sunday, 11 July 1937)As was discussed earlier in this book, a degree of confirmation of Tesla’sinterplanetary communications came from Arthur Mathews who claimed that Teslahad secretly developed the “Teslascope” for the purpose of communicating withMars. Matthews’ father was a laboratory assistant to the noted physicist LordKelvin back in the 1890s. Tesla once came over to England to meet Kelvin toconvince him that Alternating Current was more efficient than Direct. WhenMatthews was 16 his father arranged for him to apprentice under Tesla. Heeventually worked for him and continued this alliance until Tesla’s death in1943.“It’s not generally known, but Tesla actually had two huge magnifyingtransmitters built in Canada, and Matthews operated one of them. People mostlyknow about the Colorado Springs transmitters and the unfinished one on LongIsland. I saw the two Canadian transmitters. All the evidence is there.“The Teslascope is the thing Tesla invented to communicate with beings on otherplanets. In principle, it takes in cosmic ray signals and eventually the signalsare stepped down to audio. Speak into one end, and the signal goes out the otherend as a cosmic ray emitter.”With the exception of Matthews’s statements, there has been no concrete evidencethat Tesla managed to communicate with extraterrestrials or whoever wastransmitting to Tesla’s ELF receiver. It seems that Tesla was on the receivingend only. Nevertheless, Tesla managed to glean a substantial amount of goodinformation from these transmissions, enough to influence his research andinventions for the remaining forty-three years of his life.It was during this period that Tesla found himself ostracized by most of thescientific community. His efforts to interest others in such wild inventions asfree-energy, beam weapons, wireless power transmissions, antigravity devices,anti-war shields, resonation and a plethora of others, no doubt led to him beingconsidered a crackpot. Sadly, Tesla had become the epitome of a mad scientist.Yet, it was obvious that his letters to the government and military had arousedsome interest. A young American engineer engaged in war work consulted Tesla ona ballistics engineering problem because he could not get time on an overworkedcomputer and Tesla’s mind was known to offer the nearest thing to it. Soon hebecame fascinated with Tesla’s scientific papers and was allowed to take batchesof them home to his hotel room where he and another American engineer pored overthem each night. They were returned the next day, a procedure which continuedfor about two weeks prior to Tesla’s death.Tesla had received offers to work for Germany and Russia. After the inventordied, both engineers became concerned that critical scientific information hadfallen into foreign hands and alerted United States security agencies and highgovernment officials. Just how much of Tesla’s work remains hidden in thetop-secret bowels of the military is unknown.It can be deduced that Tesla’s theories of extraterrestrials and global warmingwere taken seriously by some in high-levels of authority, because it is nowknown that the United States government and military were the first to givecredence that UFOs were spacecraft from other planets. It is interesting to notethat between 1945 and 1948 an exchange of letters and cables occurred among theAir Technical Service Command at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, MilitaryIntelligence in Washington, and the Office of Alien Property. The subject…filesof the late Nikola Tesla.On September 5, 1945, Colonel Holliday of the Equipment Laboratory, Propulsionand Accessories Subdivision, wrote to Lloyd L. Shaulis of the OAP in Washington,confirming a conversation and asking for photostatic copies of the notes andpapers of the late Tesla. It was stated that the material would be used “inconnection with projects for national defense by this department.” Shaulis madethe material available to Air Technical Service Command, but there is no recordof how many copies were sent. Nor was the material ever returned. These werefull photostatic copies, not merely the abstracts. The Navy has no record ofTesla’s papers; no federal archives have records of them.Four months after the photostats had been sent to Wright Field, Col. Ralph Doty,the chief of Military Intelligence in Washington wrote James Markham of AlienProperty indicating that they had never been received: “This office is inreceipt of a communication from Headquarters, Air Technical Service Command,Wright Field, requesting that we ascertain the whereabouts of the files of thelate scientist, Dr. Nikola Tesla, which may contain data of great value to theabove Headquarters. It has been indicated that your office might have thesefiles in custody. If this is true, we would like to request your consent for arepresentative of the Air Technical Service Command to review them. In view ofthe extreme importance of these files to the above command, we would like torequest that we be advised of any attempt by any other agency to obtain them.“Because of the urgency of this matter, this communication will be delivered toyou by a Liaison Officer of this office in the hope of expediting the solicitedinformation.”The “other” agency that had the files, or should have had them, was the AirTechnical Service Command itself. On October 24, 1947, David L. Bazelon,assistant attorney general and director of the Office of alien Property, wroteto the commanding officer of the Air Technical Service Command regarding theTesla photostats. They had not been returned and the OAP wanted them back.Obviously at least one set of Tesla’s papers had reached Wright Field because onNovember 25, 1947, there was a response to the Office of Alien Property fromColonel Duffy, chief of the Electronic Plans Section, Electronic Subdivision,Engineering Division, Air Material Command, Wright Field. He replied: “Thesereports are now in the possession of the Electronic Subdivision and are beingevaluated. This should be completed by January 1, 1948. At that time your officewill be contacted with respect to final disposition of these papers.” They werenever returned or even acknowledged to have ever existed at all!In response to a Freedom of Information Act request in 1980, Wright - PattersonAir Force base stated, “The organization (Equipment Laboratory) that performedthe evaluation of Tesla's papers was deactivated several years ago. Afterconducting an extensive search of lists of records retired by that organization,in which we found no mention of Tesla’s papers, we concluded the documents weredestroyed at the time the laboratory was deactivated.”[Image00013.gif]AFTERTHOUGHTS ON NIKOLA TESLA, ALIEN AMONG USBY DIANE TESSMANNikola Tesla was an alien in a tough, cruel world. He was a gentle, humble manand the gaudy objects which money can buy, did not impress him in the least. Hewas out of place and out of time. And he was brilliant! No one since has equaledhim in sheer scientific creativity and genius.Tesla disliked the compromises, greed, and lies of “big business” in his day.Just think how much worse it has gotten today. Many of us feel as Tesla did, butthe individual’s lone voice echo’s in a vast wasteland. We may keep our soul, asTesla did, but we also feel like aliens in this greedy world.Tesla possessed integrity, dignity, and an innate sense of fair play. Injusticemade him furious. However, if his amazing inventions were to be used by largecorporations in promoting electrical energy and his other unique scientificinnovations, he would have to bend to their self-serving ways. He did not!He suffered greatly for his stand against big business and greed. He wasvirtually homeless, living in fleabag hotels, and had to watch as others becamewealthy and famous for inventions that were not the equal of his; some highlysuccessful technology was directly stolen from him. Tesla lived in poverty andanonymity but he kept his integrity. His soul was his own.W.B. Yeats writes of a “pioneer soul” and this term applies to Nikola Tesla. Hewas an individual ahead of his time; even today, he would find the world greedy,ignorant and cruel. He belongs to the future, a time when humankind will learnto feel, think and act on a higher, more enlightened level. He belongs to thefuture day when we will indeed do unto others, as we would have them do unto us.Many seekers of truth, both scientific and metaphysical, have been drawn toNikola Tesla. He speaks to us. We are awed at his inventions and knowledge, andwe are inspired by his gentle enlightenment and strength of character. Teslapossesses an immortal, mysterious persona that intrigues anyone who does notaccept anything at face value.Albert Einstein felt that true scientific genius is based in the mystical world;as we are drawn to Tesla and as he speaks to us, we perceive this truth again:Tesla’s scientific brilliance has its foundation in the spiritual and themystical.I have been a channel for 18 years and have received transmissions from avariety of interdimensional beings. At this time, Nikola Tesla sent through me,the following message for humanity as the new millennium dawns across the faceof the planet: “Humankind, this is the being you know as Tesla. I greet you inthe light of good intent. I am no longer in that ‘Tesla’ physical form, havinggone on many of your Earth years ago, to a different world in Space/Time. I amhappy here; I am home.“I came to your world, as you did, to make it a better place. You may have lostsight temporarily of the fact that you came to Earth to make it a better place.Why? Because you are so busy just trying to survive there. You are fatigued muchof the time, and speaking of time, it just flies by! I had this problem as well,and there were many times when I felt lost and depressed. But I did live myhuman lifetime to help enlightened its people, and you have also chosen thispath.“If you can leave your problems for a moment, and fly above the trees, you willsee Earth and your lifetime there in a clear perspective. Your higherperspective of ‘the forest’ tells you that you are there for a reason, to make adifference.“Do not lose your integrity, therefore. Gather your dignity about you, and neverstop having that sense of fair play. Your power base is within yourself, not inthe big corporations that attempt to run your life. They can never own you ifyou keep possession of your soul. They can never control your mind if youcontinue to allow your mind to be free and enlightened.“The time is soon coming when ‘their’ day will be over! The big internationalcorporations are not eternal. Their greedy, cruel ways selfishly trouncing onother humans, on nature’s creatures, on the environment, and on the planetherself, will soon come to an end.“Our day is coming, my fellow pioneer soul. My spirit, my persona hovers aroundEarth in these days, assisting you when and where I can. This is partially whyyou feel intrigued with my character and my work. I attempt to channel messagesto budding inventors and scientists, and I attempt to inspire spiritual seekersas well.“A new dawn comes, and a world emerges in which we are not aliens. Thevibrations of gentleness, enlightenment, curiosity, integrity and justice willbe, THE WAY IT IS. I thank you for you interest.
