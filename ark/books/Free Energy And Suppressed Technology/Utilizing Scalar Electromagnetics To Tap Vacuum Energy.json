Whittaker's previously unnoticed 1903-1904 papers which established a hidden bidirectional EM wave structure in a standing forcefield free scalar potential, a method of directly engineering the ambient potential of the vacuum has been developed and realized experimentally. Adding Whittaker's engineerable hidden variable theory to classical electro-magnetics, quantum mechanics, and general relativity produces supersets of each discipline. These supersets are joined by the common Whittaker subset, producing a unified field theory that is engineerable and tested. By treating the nucleus of the atom as a pumped phase conjugate mirror, several working model energy units have been produced which excite and organize the local vacuum, increase the local virtual photon flux between local vacuum and nucleus, establish coherent self-oscillations between the local excited vacuum and the affected nuclei, utilize the self-oscillating standing wave for self- pumping of the nuclei/mirrors, introduce a very tiny signal wave to the mirrors, and output into an external load circuit a powerful, amplified, time-reversed phase conjugate replica wave at 60 Hertz frequency and nominal 120 volt sine wave power. Several models have been built, ranging from 6 watts early on to one of 5 kilowatts. Both closed batteryless systems with damped positive feedback and open loop systems with battery-powered input have been successfully built. Open loop power gains of from 5 x 10 4 to 1.5 x 10 6 have been achieved. Antigravity experiments have also been successfully conducted where the weight of the unit was reduced by 90% in controlled experiments, with a signal wave input of 175 microwatts and an output of 1 kilowatt. file:///C|/bearden/The%20Tom%20Bearden%20Website6.htm (1 of 21)24.11.2003 20:45:04"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website The basic theory of the device is briefly explained and experimental results presented. In the demonstration session, a videotape of one operating open-loop unit with a 1.5 x 10 6 power gain is planned, as is the demonstration of an actual working model closed-loop system with a nominal rating of 500 watts, and without external power input of any kind. The units are solid state, with no moving parts. Each of them comprises a unique form of self- powered vacuum triode of extraordinary gain, where the cathode power and plate power are freely furnished by the vacuum, and only a small grid signal need be furnished either from an external power source or by clamped positive feedback from the device's output. The output is negative energy, and some of its unique characteristics are pointed out. Implications of the experimental application of the Sweet vacuum triode, the Bearden approach to the nucleus as a pumped phase conjugate mirror, and the unified field theory based on Whittaker's engineerable hidden variable scalar EM potential theory are also briefly addressed. SCALAR ELECTROMAGNETICS In 1837 Sir W.R. Hamilton said, \"The notion of time may be unfolded into an independent pure science... a science of pure time is possible.\" As is well-known, the fundamental units utilized in physics are arbitrary. It is even possible to construct all of physics on a single unit, time. This oddity shows the truth in Hamilton's statement; it is even more odd, because quantum mechanically time is not an observable. This means that the observable world can be modeled completely in terms of the nonobservable, which is essentially what modern quantum mechanics is now doing. Hamilton viewed his magnificent quaternions as essentially having accomplished the mathematical structuring of time. Maxwell's original EM theory, as is well-known, was modeled in Hamilton's quaternions , not in the highly curtailed Heaviside/Hertz vectors erroneously taught today as \"Maxwell's theory.\" Not a single one of the present so-called \"Maxwell's\" vector equations ever appeared in a book or paper by James Clerk Maxwell. For some years the author has worked on an extended electromagnetics theory, involving the scalar component of the quaternion. [ Ref. 1] In Maxwell's original quaternion theory, this scalar component often remains when the directional components zero. Further, it then enfolds vectors and functions of vectors inside, in a hidden variable manner. Specifically, the author has patterned a unified field theory concept upon the previously unnoticed but remarkable early work of E.T. Whittaker.

NOTE: SHAPE MAY BE ALL ABOVE OR ALL BELOW AMBIENT VACUUM POTENTIAL Thus Whittaker anticipated the quantum mechanical Aharonov/Bohm effect by 55 years, including extending it to the macroscopic world instead of the mesoscopic realm where it has been established to date. [ Ref. 3] In modern terms, Whittaker showed how to turn EM wave energy into electrogravitational potential energy, then how to interfere two such scalar potential waves to recover electromagnetic energy, even at a distance. [ Ref. 4] This unrecognized work is of great importance: when applied to modern physics, it produces supersets of quantum mechanics (QM), classical electromagnetics (EM), and general relativity (GR). Further, all three extended disciplines unify on their common Whittaker subset, in a testable and engineerable fashion.

The Nucleus As a PPCM and Triode The author has also considered the highly nonlinear nucleus of the atom as a pumped phase conjugate mirror (PPCM), having found no other consideration of same in the literature. The author also dubbed a PPCM a \"triode,\" since the amplified phase conjugate replica of the signal wave is much like the amplified output of a triode, and the signal wave input to a PPCM is much like a triode's grid signal input. The PPCM pump wave then corresponds roughly to the power input to the cathode and plate of a triode.

VACUUM TRIODE BACKGROUND About seven years ago, the author was privileged to see and examine an invention of Mr. Floyd Sweet, that produced about 6 watts of electrical power from the vacuum itself. This remarkable device, which the author dubbed a vacuum triode , in a single unit utilized most of the scalar EM concepts the author had so painfully and slowly formulated over the years. Sweet, a brilliant inventor with a remarkable knowledge of magnetics, had utilized barium ferrite magnets and special coils to produce a solid-state device that successfully tapped the vacuum energy. The author quickly put together a theoretical concept for the energy-tapping mechanism, based on treatment of the nucleus as a PPCM and Whittaker's scalar EM potential unified field theory. [ Ref. 7] The author furnished the technical concept, treating the nucleus as a pumped phase conjugate mirror, to the inventor along with copies of Whittaker's papers. Sweet's Synthesis and Extension file:///C|/bearden/The%20Tom%20Bearden%20Website6.htm (5 of 21)24.11.2003 20:45:04"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website Sweet is also a brilliant EM theoretician, working in four, five, or even six dimensions with ease. He immediately synthesized the entire PPCM and Whittaker theory, and developed a complete theoretical treatment of the device. [ Ref. 8] He also increased the nuclear potential utilized in the activated nuclei of the device, which increased the pumping energy and hence the energy output. He next produced an open-loop vacuum triode (VT) with an output of 500 watts, for an input of 33 microwatts. Thereafter he produced several other models, including closed-loop systems and one with 5-KW output. Purpose of This Paper Our purpose is to explain the detailed scalar EM concept of the operation of the vacuum triode, since it is a universal method for cohering and tapping useful EM energy from the vacuum. The author believes that this mechanism is the fundamental mechanism that must be invoked in any over-unity device that electromagnetically extracts vacuum energy as electromagnetic effects. We also intend to demonstrate a full working model of the device at this conference. Sweet's detailed theoretical treatment will be completed and submitted to a major journal shortly, to complete the scientific exposition of the new methodology. I must also express my deep admiration for my brilliant inventor colleague. It has been a privilege to work with him, though under great difficulties and at a distance. He has developed several other related devices that are of great importance to the emerging new physics of vacuum engineering , in the sense referred to by Lee. [ Ref. 9] To mention just one, he has produced a magnetic lens which apparently can directly display the vacuum's virtual particle flux, or a good analog of it. So far as I am aware, this is the only extant instrument today that can perform this feat. When the vacuum triode has been proven to the scientific community, it is my intention to nominate Sweet for the Nobel Prize he so richly deserves, and seek high scientific endorsements for the recommendation. INTRODUCTION Entropy As is well known, in any closed dynamic system the order existing in it will gradually be dissipated, as more and more interactions occur. This leads to the notion of entropy as the increasing disorder in such systems. The assumptions are file:///C|/bearden/The%20Tom%20Bearden%20Website6.htm (6 of 21)24.11.2003 20:45:04"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website 1. a closed system, and 2. a positive flow of time for the components of the system. Actually no such thing as a completely closed system exists in nature. Every mass system is open to virtual particle flux exchange with the vacuum, for example, particularly in the nucleus of its atoms, where the bulk of its mass is located. However, the closed system assumption is reasonably approximated by a great many systems which are in stable thermodynamic equilibrium, or nearly so. On the other hand, in an open system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the second law of thermodynamics does not necessarily apply, because the system violates both the closed system assumption and its equilibrium approximation. [ Ref. 10] Time Reversal Since being discovered in 1972 in the open Soviet literature, the time-reversed (phase conjugate) EM wave has also been known. The phase conjugate EM wave is truly time-reversed, as has been shown experimentally. Since the time-reversed EM wave violates the second major assumption, the second law of thermodynamics need not necessarily hold for time-reversed entities. Putting all this together, if one wishes negentropy and hence increased energy in a system, the candidate suggested would appear to be a system that was strongly 1. open loop, 2. time-reversed, and 3. far from thermodynamic equilibrium. A good overview of time-reversal in physics has been provided by Sachs. [ Ref. 11] Engineering the Nucleus Since the nucleus already provides a myriad of time-reversed processes, engineering the nucleus of an atom is a very good candidate for practical negentropy. To engineer the nucleus directly, a Whittaker potential is first artificially constructed, by composing a harmonic set of phase-locked EM wave/antiwave pairs. It is accented that the antiwaves must be true phase conjugates; otherwise they will not constitute a gradient-free Whittaker standing potential wave. In addition, at least one harmonic interval must be used, and additional harmonic sets are most file:///C|/bearden/The%20Tom%20Bearden%20Website6.htm (7 of 21)24.11.2003 20:45:04"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website desirable. The reason is that a space-time lattice must be formed in the vacuum, where the energy is additive spatially but oppositive in t-dot, the rate of flow of time, in the fourth dimension. So a time-structure is required as well as a spatial structure, which is what is provided by n bidirectional harmonic Whittaker EM wave sets, where n is an integer greater than 1. Once a specific Whittaker structure has been chosen, the local lattice of space-time is established. This establishes phase-locked lattice groupings of coupled photon/antiphoton pairs, or of gravitons . In turn, this Whittaker-structured vacuum now contains specific graviton vacuum engines , which directly engineer and structure the vacuum's virtual particle flux (VPF) exchange with the nucleus. [ Ref. 12] The nucleus is highly nonlinear, hence strongly phase conjugative, or time-reversed. The ambient potential of the local vacuum surrounding the nucleus is in a violent virtual photon exchange with it, accounting for its electrical charge. Since the preponderant charge is positive, from the viewpoint of the ordinary light observer whose light interacts with electron shells, the nucleus may be taken to exhibit time reversal (phase conjugation). Energy, Time, and Gravitons We take the definition of \"energy\" to be fundamentally an ordering imposed upon the VPF of vacuum. We take photon scattering from the electron shells of atoms to be the fundamental exterior mechanism producing forward flow of external observer time. It then follows that \"time's arrow\" for the EM observer is due to the universal scattering of photons from electron shells. In this view, forward (positive) time flow and entropy are due to the same primary action: photon scattering from electron shells. It is unfortunate that the concept of \"positive\" energy has been tied to, and defined in terms of, the scattering and dissipation of VPF order as work , or energy expended. Via the standard labeling, then, negative energy is the reconstitution of order in the vacuum VPF. It should be noted that, in a PPCM, dissipative or external pump wave stress energy can be scavenged and re-emitted in perfect order as the phase conjugate replica. This is a negentropic process, for it is capable of turning disorder into order. [ Ref. 13] In the time-reversed PPCM nucleus, we should expect to see appreciable negative energy â that is, energy removed from the EM scattering domain. This includes the binding energy of the nucleus, and the gravitational (G) potential energy of the EM energy removed from the \"scattering interaction realm\" and locked into the mass. Following Sakharov, we hold that the G-field is not a fundamental field of nature, but a composite file:///C|/bearden/The%20Tom%20Bearden%20Website6.htm (8 of 21)24.11.2003 20:45:04"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website caused by, or made from, other fields. [ Ref. 14] To the first order, we assume the G-potential is comprised of coupled photon/antiphoton pairs, on the average, where the statistical coupled spin-2 photon/antiphoton pair is a graviton . [ Ref. 15] We follow the modern view of the field: because of vacuum fluctuations, rigorously one no longer speaks of \"the\" field, but of the probability of a particular field configuration . [ Ref. 16] We also hold the vacuum to be composed of potentials, and regard the three terms space-time, vacuum , and scalar potential as essentially synonymous. Newton's Third Law and the Detection Process The VPF EM stress of the local vacuum immediately surrounding the nucleus may be decomposed a la Whittaker into opposing bidirectional EM plane waves/forces. Thus the nonlinear nucleus may be regarded as a pumped phase conjugate mirror, normally with a gain of one. In this view, Newton's third law reaction force is generated because the so-called \"photon\" interaction with an atom is in fact a graviton reaction involving a photon/antiphoton pair that is decoupled. The decoupled photon normally is absorbed and reradiated by an orbital electron, while the decoupled antiphoton interacts with the nucleus, producing a time-reversed twin of the external force â or, in other words, Newton's third law reaction force, which gives a slight recoil of the nucleus. Half of every measurement physicists normally make is discarded, with the missing half accounting only for Newtonian reaction in the meter or instrument, which is usually ignored. The fact that half of our measurement interactions are ignored is occasionally discovered and noted by physicists, who may even write a paper pointing it out, but no change is instituted in the foundations. [ Ref. 17 and Ref 18] Semiconducting Vacuum and Self-Oscillation The vacuum immediately surrounding the nucleus is structured by the nucleus, and is itself nonlinear and capable of acting as a semiconductor . [ Ref. 19] Since both this immediately local semiconductor vacuum and the nucleus it surrounds are highly nonlinear, then nonlinear resonance can conceivably be established between them. Further, since the resonating system in such case is an open system away from thermodynamic equilibrium, the oscillation can be self-sustaining. Such self-oscillation of the pumping of a PCM is already well-known in the nonlinear optical literature, particularly with compounds containing barium. [ Ref. 20] file:///C|/bearden/The%20Tom%20Bearden%20Website6.htm (9 of 21)24.11.2003 20:45:04"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website THE VACUUM TRIODE The Basic Concept As is well-known, a stress can be decomposed into opposing sets of forces. But quantum mechanically, the forces we are interested in with our work here are all caused electromagnetically , by the exchange of virtual photons. Even mechanical force, according to QM, is caused in this manner. Thus opposing electromagnetic or mechanical \"stress\" sets of bidirectional EM forces are microscopically equivalent to the notion of pump waves in nonlinear optics. Hence under the proper conditions, it follows that trapped EM stress energy of the vacuum can be utilized to \"pump\" the nucleus. Treating the stress-pumped nonlinear nucleus as a PPCM, it follows that the stress energy of the vacuum can be tapped by a 4-wave mixing mechanism in the atomic nucleus, to provide amplified phase conjugate EM wave outputs from the atom in response to small signal wave inputs. [ Ref. 21] In the proper nonlinear material, the material may act as a PPCM, in which case there exists a suitable connection between the material's atomic nuclei and its external electromagnetic lattice bonds, and the amplified phase conjugate replica wave generated in the nucleus will be emitted from the material as an EM wave field. This field can then be tapped by suitable means and output to an external load circuit. Block Diagram of the Vacuum Triode Figure 4 shows a basic block diagram of the vacuum triode process, utilized by Sweet in several laboratory vacuum energy devices. These devices have ranged from a nominal 500 watt output in a 6- lb. device to 5 kilowatts for a heavier unit. Gains have ranged from 50,000 to 1,500,000 for open- loop systems. Both open-loop and closed-loop systems have been built and tested. Figure 4 shows a combined block diagram for either a closed-loop or open-loop system. In the open- loop system, a barium ferrite magnetic material is used as a pumped phase conjugate mirror. In the \"standard\" design, two opposing PPCMs are used. The advantage of this dual combination is the use of self-targeting (repetitive phase conjugation, signal by signal). This has the effect of 1. stabilizing the Whittaker field, and 2. producing a quantum potential between the two mirrors, so the mirrors and the Whittaker potential between them are essentially one single space-time entity. Discussion of a quantum potential is beyond the scope of this paper, but the technical mechanism for creating one has been previously presented by the author on several occasions. [ Ref. 22] file:///C|/bearden/The%20Tom%20Bearden%20Website6.htm (10 of 21)24.11.2003 20:45:04"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website First we will explain the open-loop operation of the vacuum triode. In Figure 4, on the right an external 60 Hz, nominal 10 volt AC sine wave of several tens of microwatts in power is input into the stabilized field of the barium ferrite magnet structure, where it modulates the field, producing a signal wave input into the atoms of the material. In the top right block, the EM signal wave interacts with the electron shell of an atom, which in turn is EM-coupled to the nucleus. Figure 4. The Vacuum Triode Concept. Thus an EM signal wave is input to the nucleus of the atom, which is highly nonlinear (middle top block). Earlier, Sweet had specifically conditioned the atomic nuclei with a proprietary process, wherein in the barium nucleus a trapped 60 Hz scalar EM spherical wave resonance (self-oscillation) exists between the structured semiconductor vacuum immediately surrounding the Ba nucleus. In the same activation process, the ambient potential of the surrounding vacuum was raised and stabilized, in the two leftmost blocks. At this point the nonlinear nucleus is effectively self-pumped by the trapped, excited, spherical scalar wave oscillation between the structured semiconductor vacuum and the nucleus. The nucleus is now a strongly pumped phase conjugate mirror. file:///C|/bearden/The%20Tom%20Bearden%20Website6.htm (11 of 21)24.11.2003 20:45:04"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website Consequently, when the signal wave input arrives, the PPCM nucleus emits an amplified phase conjugate replica (PCR) wave, which precisely backtracks the input signal wave. This precise backtracking (perfect retroreflection) is referred to as the \"distortion correction theorem.\" In short, the powerful PCR wave returns precisely toward the external source, passing through the electron shells and arriving in the perturbed barium ferrite magnet assembly field, where it perturbs the field. A transformer-like system then extracts this magnetic field perturbation and conducts it to the external load circuit. However, the PCR contains negative energy. Short of the load, the internal circuits run cool, rather than heating. This is a signature of a true vacuum energy tapping device. Indeed, if the output leads of the Sweet vacuum triode are physically shorted together, a brilliant flash occurs, and the leads instantly ice as if dipped in liquid oxygen. This is another signature of the true negentropic over-unity vacuum tap. Note that the energy extracted from the semiconducting vacuum adjacent to the nucleus is just instantly replaced by the surrounding vacuum's inexhaustible energy pool. This is an open-loop system, with a hidden energy source: the intense virtual particle flux of the vacuum's ambient charge. It is not possible to exhaust that flux, which is often calculated to have an energy density of some 10 100 or more grams per cm 3 , if the energy were cohered and condensed into mass. As can be seen, even a VT gain of 1.5 x 10 6 represents a \"vacuum tap\" of an incredibly small efficiency, on the order of 10 -100 or so. However, the vacuum \"river\" is so energetic that such efficiencies are quite sufficient. We accent that the barium ferrite magnetic material must be activated so that stable self-oscillation between the barium nucleus and the surrounding semiconductor vacuum exists. Although self- oscillating/self-pumped PCMs are known at optical frequencies, Sweet has discovered and perfected a brilliant methodology for activating PPCM nuclei at ELF frequencies. In a resistive load such as light bulbs, the resistive material accomplishes repetitive phase conjugation. Thus in the resistor, half the total energy is expressed as photon or dissipative energy in the external (electron shell) level. As the excited electrons decay, they emit scattered EM energy as light and heat. This is an exothermic interaction. The other half of the total energy reacts in the atomic nuclei, as a phase conjugative or endothermic interaction. We strongly accent that, Whittaker-wise, there are two electromagnetic channels and two kinds of EM: file:///C|/bearden/The%20Tom%20Bearden%20Website6.htm (12 of 21)24.11.2003 20:45:04"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website 1. external EM, the common electron-shell interacting, entropic, scattering, time-forward kind, and 2. the internal , unsuspected, hidden variable, nuclei interacting, negentropic, reordering/ convergent kind. Internal EM travels strictly between atomic nuclei, normally not reacting with electron shells unless a pumped phase conjugate mirror reaction is invoked in the nucleus to produce a gain somewhat greater than unity. Thus if we wish to communicate with atomic nuclei directly, and engineer them directly, we must utilize the internal EM channel via applied Whittaker methods. Antigravity Tests Inherent in the preceding discussions is the possibility to turn EM energy into gravitational energy of either sign. In other words, one should be able to utilize Sweet's vacuum triode to produce and demonstrate antigravity. Indeed this is the case. Sweet has also discovered the special alterations necessary to perform straightforward transformation of the internal energy in the nucleus to antigravitational energy, producing a unilateral thrust upward. Note that the bulk of G-potential gradient (G-force-field) occurs Whittaker-wise at ELF frequencies. This explains why nonlinear phase conjugate opticians do not notice direct antigravity effects. At the optical frequencies at which they work, the effects are so miniscule that they are negligible. This is readily explained as follows: In QM, the quantum (photon) is comprised of action (angular momentum), not just energy. It is rather like a \"piece of energy welded to a piece of time, with no seam in the middle.\" Since quantum change occurs in quanta, the decoupling of the energy and time components, in the continual interaction of photons with matter, exchanges energy between G-potential of vacuum and trapped mass of the atom or particle. In this exchange, small increments of time are continually being formed (and unformed, as photon emission occurs). Consequently, each mass is moving forward in time in small incremental jumps, usually of exceedingly small magnitude. However, the energy and time trapped in a photon are canonical. The greater the piece of energy, the smaller the piece of time, and vice versa. So if one wishes to stress the \"rate of flow of time\" significantly, one needs to produce large amounts of photons that have very large pieces of time, and consequently little pieces of energy. Since the energy of the photon is directly proportional to its frequency, this means that the lower file:///C|/bearden/The%20Tom%20Bearden%20Website6.htm (13 of 21)24.11.2003 20:45:04"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website frequency photons have larger time increments, and hence endure over many \"regular-sized photon absorption/emission changes\" to appreciably stress the rate of time flow/production. The bottom line is that the standard pumped phase conjugate mirror can be adapted to produce antigravity at ELF frequencies, but precisely the same adaptation at optical frequencies will have negligible effect. With this in mind, the author requested Sweet to perform an antigravity experiment to prove the thesis. With Sweet's proprietary adaptation of his vacuum triode/PPCM, the experiment produced rather straightforward but spectacular results, as shown in Figure 5. The experiment was performed as follows: Rigged for antigravity, the 6-lb. device was placed on a scale so that its weight could be continuously monitored. A special external load box was utilized in which multiple electric light sockets were connected in parallel. Then the external load draw was adjusted by merely screwing in 100-watt lamps, one at a time, with measurement and observation pauses in between. The output of the device was 120 volt, negative AC sine-wave power at 60 Hz. For each 100-watt increment, the load power was recorded and the weight was carefully recorded. The results are shown in the rather smooth, classic curve shown in Figure 5. At 1,000 watts load draw, the previously 6-lb. device had reduced its weight due to gravity by 90 percent. At that point the signal-wave (grid) input to the open-loop vacuum triode was only 175.4 microamps at 10 volts, or just under two milliwatts. file:///C|/bearden/The%20Tom%20Bearden%20Website6.htm (14 of 21)24.11.2003 20:45:04"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website EXTERNAL ELECTRICAL LOAD (HUNDREDS OF WATTS) Figure 5. Antigravity Test of Sweet's Adapted Vacuum Triode. We accent that the nominal two milliwatt input is only a gating signal. It is the organized, gated vacuum energy that is performing the action. The experiment was stopped short of actual hovering and flying due to safety considerations. With the specific adaptation, magnetic monopoles are deposited in the magnet materials, producing internal tensile stress. Since no explosive controlled facilities were available, and there was no wish to destroy the VT, the experiment was terminated at 90% antigravity performance. It was completely successful, and adequately demonstrated the validity of the unified field theory concepts utilized in our approach.

Though not discussed in this paper, application of the concepts and methodology to a large variety of other fields, such as medical reversal of aging and curing of almost the entire range of present debilitating diseases, has been previously pointed out.

SPECULATED IMPLICATIONS As can be seen, the implications of the new approach are profound. The authors believe they have ushered in the forerunner of a vast new physics, one which will change our lives, and our view of physical reality, in ways previously undreamed of. By mastering, controlling, and gating the vast, incredible energy of the seething vacuum, we can power our automobiles, flying machines, and technology inexhaustibly. Further, it can be done absolutely cleanly; there are no noxious chemical pollutants to poison the biosphere.

Not discussed in this paper, it turns out that living systems, faced with the problem of achieving negentropy so as to maintain their form in a dissipative external physical reality, have always used the hidden internal channel for such things as mind, thought, cell control, and living functions. With the new methodology, one now faces the advent of access and engineering of the mind and life of the observer as readily as the observer's physical body. Transmutation of the elements, control of the weather, lighting and powering our cities and homes cheaply and cleanly, and provision of plenty for everyone is the vista for the future. We can in fact clean up the radioactive wastes, rid ourselves of coarse nuclear and petroleum powerplants. We strongly stress that, with the ability to engineer the Schroedinger equation itself, the new methodology allows the direct engineering and control of quantum change, and hence of physical reality itself. The methodology is extendable to hyperdimensions; nested virtual levels of the vacuum are already precisely that. The author has already pointed out the application of this emerging technology to the absolute cure of diseases such as AIDS, cancer, leukemia, etc., and shown that the Priore device in France already proved the efficacy of the application in the 60s and 70s. We shall be able to rid ourselves and our descendents of diseases. With direct access to the actual software of life and mind, in the future we should be able to achieve levels of education previously unattainable, by directly inputting the relevant software. Previously we have also pointed out that four nations of the world are already embarked on weaponization of scalar EM unified field technology. It is sobering to think that, in addition to having the ability to make our planet a paradise for humankind, we also will have the ability to make it a hades. For that reason, we are doing our best to clarify the technical concept and the theory in this 1991, hopefully with the view that humankind will seize upon the positive aspects, and develop and apply this technology for the betterment of all people everywhere. Long ago, Albert Einstein said these words: \"It would of course be a great step forward if we succeeded in combining the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field into a single structure. Only so could the era in theoretical physics inaugurated by Faraday and Clerk Maxwell be brought to a satisfactory close.\" And Teilhard de Chardin wrote: \"Someday, after we have mastered the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love.

If so, let us all use the knowledge wisely. REFERENCES 1.

The first paper was in fact a detailed theory of the scalar standing potential wave that Nikola Tesla discovered four years earlier, on the night of July 3-4 1899, being radiated from thunderstorms, which he entered in his Colorado Springs Notebook on the morning of the 4th. More recently the Whittaker structure (WS) inside potentials, including the Schroedinger potential, has been shown by V.K. Ignatovich, \"The Remarkable Capabilities of Recursive Relations,\" Am. J. Phys ., 57(10), Oct. 1989, p. 873-878, without credit to Whittaker or to the presence of such structured scalar potentials in Maxwell's original quaternion EM theory. These WSs are universal to scalar potentials; e.g., for the same in acoustics, see Richard W. Ziolkowski, \"Localized Transmission of Wave Energy,\" Proc.

Bohm, \"Significance of Electromagnetic Potentials in the Quantum Theory,\" Phys. Rev ., Second Series, 115(3), Aug. 1, 1959, p. 458-491. This paper pointed out the primacy of the potentials. Instead of being causative agents, the force fields are actually effects generated from the potentials. This is in complete violation of both classical electromagnetics and classical dynamics, but it is absolutely required by quantum mechanics.

It is pointed out that today all potentials are well-known to be gravitational entities. However, this was not known in Whittaker's time, and so he himself did not realize that he had actually produced an engineerable, testable unified theory of electromagnetics and gravitation. 5. T.E.

In a normal triode tube, the amplified plate signal is 180 degrees out of phase spatially with the grid input, but in- phase with it in respect to rate of flow through time . In a PPCM, the amplified phase conjugate replica wave is in phase spatially with the signal wave, but 180 degrees out of phase with it in respect to its rate of flow through time. It is pointed out that a PCM with a gain of unity produces a coupled EM wave/antiwave pair whose energy is additive in 3-space but subtractive in the first derivative of the fourth dimension, time. Hence it is no longer an electromagnetic wave as such, but an oscillatory wave of stress upon the local rate of flow of time. Hence it is a powerful electrogravitational wave , whose EM nature is hidden in the guise of a scalar EM potential. It is also a wave of variation in the local gauge, and of variation in the local ST curvature. 7. See T.E. Bearden, The Phase Conjugate Vacuum Triode , Apr. 23, 1987, privately published. An earlier pencil draft was initially produced. 8. Sweet has continued to extend his theoretical treatment. A formal paper providing the complete mathematical theory of the vacuum triode has been drafted, is in final review, and will be submitted to a leading journal by mid-1991. 9.

In 1977 Ilya Prigogine received the Nobel Prize for extending thermodynamics; in particular, for the theory of dissipative structures in nonequilibrium thermodynamics. In Prigogine systems, negentropy is known to be possible. 11. Robert G. Sachs, The Physics of Time Reversal , Univ. Chi. Press., Chicago, 1987. 12. Note that this moves the entire notion of the charge of a fundamental particle to a deeper and more extended level. Now the charge may be discretized , but it is not quantized in the hard conventional sense. Further, the internal Whittaker structure of the massless VPF photon exchange of vacuum and mass, which, quantum mechanically, is what the electrical charge of the particle is in the first place, is deterministically structured. Note that this violates the present assumption that all like charged particles are identical; now two electrons may have either the same or different magnitudes of charge, and even when the magnitudes are the same, their internal charge structures (Whittaker structures) and VPF exchange with the vacuum may differ. Also note that this resolves the severe QM problem of missing chaos (hidden order) in quantum change. The reason for the problem was the use of Gibbs statistics with its assumption of random variable change, which a priori excluded hidden order (and hence chaos) from QM. That was only a special case, albeit an important one. There are now three QM cases: (1) the conventional case, where there is no hidden order; (2) the case where there is some hidden order, and the statistics is chaotic, not random; and (3) the case where the QM change is deterministic, with essentially total hidden order.

The present second law of thermodynamics is written only for time-forward entities, and need not apply for the time-reversed case. Merely viewing the energy-dissipating forward time case in reverse allows an appreciation of the time-reversed case. In other words, the second law of thermodynamics is incomplete as presently stated. The complete law has a corollary to cover the increase in order as the time-reversal of the system increases. Thus the complete law consists of two parts: (1) the entropic, time-forward case, and (2) the negentropic time- reversed case. Since the re-ordering can be amplified at will by a PPCM process, the correct distinction between the two subsets of the complete law is important, and applies to real systems. 14. A.D.

A nonlinear material may simply emit a photon, or it may act as a phase conjugate mirror (PCM) and emit a phase conjugate replica of the absorbed photon. When the material emits a normal photon, it measurably recoils. When it emits a time-reversed photon, it does not recoil, as already experimentally established in nonlinear phase conjugate optics. The solution to the mystery is this: When emitting a normal photon, the material does not act as a PCM. In that case the matching antiphoton which split from the interacting graviton (the graviton that yielded the external photon) interacts with the nucleus, producing a recoil action with a gain of one. Thus Newtonian third-law recoil of the nucleus occurs. On the other hand, when the material acts as a PCM, it also emits the antiphoton outside the atom to \"backtrack\" the absorbed \"signal wave\" photon. In that case there is no Newtonian recoil of the nucleus, because the agent for causing recoil did not interact with the nucleus to produce it. 19. Richard E.
