[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" Introduction to the English Edition of – Nuclear Transmutation: The Reality of Cold Fusion by Dr. Tadahiko Mizuno Department of Nuclear Engineering Hokkaido National University, Japan English translation by Jed Rothwell Infinite Energy Press Concord, New Hampshire, U.S.A. With a Foreword by Eugene F. Mallove, Sc.D. Introduction by Jed Rothwell The announcement of cold fusion in March 1989 at the University of Utah was greeted with worldwide hysteria. Drs. Martin Fleischmann and Stanle y Pons had claimed that an electrochemical cell with heavy water electroly te and a palladium cathode put out so much excess energy that the mysterious phenomenon had to be nuclear, and was probably a process related to nuclear fusion. Newspapers and mag azines said it might be a major scientific discovery with the potential to end the energy crisis and revolu tionize society. For a few heady weeks the public took it se riously and waited anxiously for labor atories to repli cate the results. Many scientists quickly took sides for or against cold fusion – mostly against. Then, by the end of the summer of 1989 the official word came, in an authoritative report wr itten by a select panel of experts under the auspices of the Department of Energy: cold fusion was a bust. It did not exist. It was an experimental e rror. It could not be reproduced. N early every scientific journal, magazine and newspaper on earth reported this , and cold fusion abruptly dropped out of the headlines. The story, it seemed, was over. Actu ally, it had barely begun. Only a few thousand electrochemists in the world were qualified to do the experiments, and most of them were too busy or not interested in trying. In that autumn as public interest faded and the U.S. Department of Energy pronounced a death sentence, a small nu mber of experienced scientists prepared serious, full-scale experiments. One of them was Tadahiko Mizuno, an a ssistant professor who had been doing similar electrochemical expe riments for more than twenty years. Mizuno wrote this short book about his work and personal experiences . It is the best informal account yet written about the daily life of a cold fusion re searcher. It gives you a sense of what the job feels like. It is not intended to be technical. For technical details, the reader is invited to examine Mizuno’s numerous scientific papers, some of which are listed in the references. One event described here which is not desc ribed in the technical literature is an extraordinary 10-day long heat-after-death incident that occurred in 1991. News of this appeared"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" in the popular press, but a for mal descripti on was never published in a scientific paper. 1 Mizuno says this is b ecause he do es not have carefully establish ed calorim etric data to p rove the event occurred, but I think he does not need it. The ce ll went out of control. Mizuno cooled it over 10 days by placing it in a large bucket of water. Du ring this period, m ore than 37 liters of water evaporated from the bucket, which m eans the ce ll produced m ore than 84 m egajoules of energy during this period alone, and 114 megajoules during the entire experim ent. The only active material in the cell was 100 gram s of palladium . It produced 27 tim es m ore energy than an equivalent m ass of the best chem ical fuel, ga soline, can produce. I think the 36 lite rs of evapora ted water cons titute be tter sc ientif ic evid ence than th e m ost carefully calib rated high precision instrum ent could produce. T his is first- principle proof of heat . A bucket left by itself for 10 days in a univers ity laboratory will not lose any m easurable level of water to ev aporation. First p rincip le experim ents are no t fashionab le. Many scien tists nowadays will no t look at a sim ple experim ent in which 36 liters of wa ter evaporate, but high tech instrum ents and com puters are not used. They will dism iss this as “anecdotal evidence. ” It is a terrible sham e that Mizuno did not cal l in a dozen other scien tists to see and feel the hot cell. I would have set up a 24-hour vig il with graduate students and video cam eras to observe th e cell and m easure the evaporated wa ter ca refully. This is one of history’s heartbreaking lost opport unities. News of this event, properly docum ented and attested to by many peopl e, m ight have convinced thousands of sc ientists worldwide that cold fusion is real. This m ight have been one of the m ost eff ective sc ientif ic demons trations in history. Unfortunately, it occurred during an extende d national holiday, a nd Mizuno decided to disconnect the cell from the recording equipm ent and hide it in his laboratory. He placed it behind a steel sheet because he was afraid it m ight explode. H e told m e he was not anxious to have the cell certified by m any other people because he thought that he would soon replicate the effect in ano ther exp erim ent. Alas , in the seven years since, neither he nor any other scientist has ever seen such dram atic, inargua ble proof of m assive excess energy.   Here is a chronology of th e heat-after-death event: March 1991. A new experim ent with the closed cell begins. April 1991. Cell shows sm all but significant excess heat. April 22, 1991. Electrolysis stopped. April 25. Mizuno and Akim oto note that tem perature is elevated. It has produced 1.2 H 10 7 joules since April 22, in heat-after-death. F. Nakano, “Mohaya hitei dekinai jyouon kakuyuugou [The reality of cold fusion can no longer be denied],” Bungei Shunju , S eptem ber 1991 "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" The cell is removed from the underground la b and transferred to Mizuno’s lab. Cell temperature is >100 deg C. April 26. Cell temperature has not declined. Cell tr ansferred to a 15-liter bucket, where it is partially submerged in water. April 27. Most of the water in the bucket, ~10 liters, has evaporated. The cell is transferred to a larger, 20 liter bucket. It is fully submerged in 15 liters of water. April 30. Most of the water has evaporated; ~10 liters. More water is added to the bucket, bringing the total to 15 liters again. May 1. 5 liters of water are added to the bucket. May 2. 5 more liters are added to the bucket. May 7. The cell is finally cool. 7.5 liter s of water remain in the bucket. Total evaporation equals: April 27 10 liters evaporat ed. Water level set at 15 liters in a new bucket. April 30 10 liters evaporated. Wa ter replenished to 15 liters May 1 5 liters replenished. May 2 5 liters replenished May 7 7.5 liters remaining. Thus, evaporation since April 30 is: 15+5+5-7.5=17.5 liters. Total ev aporation is 37.5 liters. The heat of vaporization of water is 540 calories per gram (2,268 joules per gram), so vaporization alone accounts for 85 megajoules. One aspect of the heat-after-death event seems particularly strange. It is as if the cathode is trying to maintain stasis inside the cell. After the external 60 watt heater was turned off, the heat-after-death reaction increase d just about enough to compensate for the loss of external heat. This sounds like an instrument error. It prompted Mizuno to double check all instrument readings with meters attached directly to the se nsors. As unbelievable as th is sounds, it is a real phenomenon which others have observed. Stanley Pons noted that the cold fusion effect has a kind of “memory.” After a perturbation, temperature te nds to return to a fixed level. Perhaps this is not so strange. The physical configuration of de uterons in the metal cont rols the power level."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Tiny spots in the surface of th e cathode are probably formed in what Edmund Storms of Los Alamos National Laboratory calls “a special confi guration of matter” with highly active, densely packed deuterium. Until these spots change or disperse, the nuclear fuel being fed into the reaction remains constant, so the cell tends to return to the same power level. A chemical wood fire works the same way. You can partially dou se a roaring fire. If the fire does not go out altogether and the wood remains in the same positi on, after a while it will start burning again and return to its former power level. Pons and Fl eischmann used a three-minute pulse of heat to “kick” their cells from low level heat to the high level heat that rapidly in creased to boil off. The heat was generated by joule heating from exte rnally supplied power, but once the cathode was boosted into higher activity the external power could be with drawn and the cathode continued to self-heat – thus “heat-after-death.” Metal undergoing cold fusion ‘wants’ to be hot and will keep itself hot, prolonging the reaction. When Mizuno put his cell in the bucket of water the reaction began to turn off, presumably because the water in the bucket cool ed the cathode. It did not quench the reaction immediately because the cathode was fairly well insulated inside a large thermal mass. Later, the water in the bucket warmed up well above room temp erature, ten liters of it evaporated, leaving the cell surrounded by air. The cell be gan to self heat again and it returned to its previously high level of activity. Storms thinks that in the special configurati on, the deuterium diffusion rate is slower at high temperatures than usual. Normal Beta-phase palladium deuteride will de-gas more rapidly when it heats up. Storms thinks that when the temperature falls (or is lowered by a thermal shock), the deuteride converts to Beta-pha se and begins rapidly de-gassing, and the cold fusion effect goes away. Mizuno has often talked about the prehistory of cold fusion. Most great discoveries are visited and revisited many times before someone stakes a permanent claim. People sometimes stumble over a new discovery without even realizi ng what they see. Mizuno did his graduate and post graduate work on corrosion using highly lo aded metal hydrides. His experiments were almost exactly like those of cold fusion, but th ey were performed for a different purpose. In retrospect, he realized that he saw anomalous events that may have been cold fusion. At the time he could not determine the cause, he did not imagine it might be fusion, and he had to leave the mystery unsolved. No scientist has time to tr ack down every anomaly. I expect many people saw and disregarded evidence for cold fusion over the years. Mizuno makes a provocative assertion. He says that long before 1989 he wondered whethe r the immense pressure of electrolysis might produce “some form of fusion.” He says: “This ki nd of hypothesis would occur to any researcher studying metal and hydrogen systems. It is not a particularly profound or outstanding idea. It never occurred to me to pursue the matter and res earch this further.” He appears to downplay the role of Pons and Fleischmann. Perhaps he exag gerates when he says “any researcher” would think of it, but on the other hand Paneth and Peters and others did investig ate this topic in the 1920s. It has been floating around the literature fo r a long time. Pons and Fleischmann deserve credit because they did more than merely speculate about it. They succeeded in doing the experiments to prove it. Perhaps cold fusion is self-evident in the way that many great"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" discoveries are. An ordinary ge nius finds an obscure and diffic ult truth which remains obscure even after he publishes, except to other experts. A superlative genius makes a discovery that few other people imagined, yet which everyone later agrees is obvious in retrospect. When T. H. Huxley learned of the theory of natural selection, he reportedly exclaimed: “why didn’t I think of that!” Within days of the 1989 announcement Mizuno set to work on a “crude, preliminary” experiment. He built the cell in single afternoon, wh ich is in itself astonishing. His purpose was to detect neutrons, which he along with everyon e else in 1989 assumed wo uld be the principal signature of the reaction. Months later it became clear that heat is the principal signature and neutrons appear sporadically. The neutron flux is a million times smaller in proportion to the heat than it is with hot fusion. His colleague Akimoto, an expert in neutron detection, soon convinced him that the instrumentation must be improved and the cell must be moved to a well-shielded location before meaningful results might be obtained. The underground laboratory housing the linear accelerator, close by on campus, was the ideal spot for the experiment, but it is hardly an ideal place for people. It is dark, dank, and unhe ated in winter, as Mizuno well knew from years of doing graduate research there. After weeks of operation, the experiment showed slight signs of generating 2.45 MeV neutrons. Mi zuno decided to get serious. Here we learn what real a scientist is made of. While the rest of the world rushed to judgment, Mizuno buckled down and began a sec ond “serious” experiment. The preparations took eight months. Mizuno and a graduate student worked long days building and testing the cell, and preparing the anode, cat hode, electrolyte, and controls. They planned to run at 100 E C and 10 atmospheres of pressure, so they ran pressure tests at 150 E C and 50 atmospheres, improving the seals and connections until they saw no significant pressure decline for days. Finally they were ready to begi n the first test run. The hysteria was long past. The press and the establishment had dismissed cold fusion. Real experiments by people like Mizuno were getting underway. When these tests were finished and docu mented, a year or two later, they constituted definitive proof of tritium, excess heat and transmut ation. It is tempting to think that the tragedy of cold fusion boils down to . . . a short attenti on span. If only Nature, the newspapers, the DoE and the American Physical Society understood that you cannot do a resear ch project in a few weeks, they would have withheld judgment un til Mizuno, Fritz Will, Melvin Miles and others published in 1990 and 1991. In person, Mizuno is charming, self deprecatin g, optimistic and brimming with ideas. In the book he describes the dark side of the st ory: the frustration, the boredom, the endless guerrilla war with scientists w ho wanted to stop the research , and science journalists who appeared to thrive on the outpour ing of supposedly negative results , and the fruitless battles to publish a paper or be heard at a physics conferen ce. Research means year s of hard work which must often be done in appalling circumstances: in an unheated undergroun d laboratory, late at night, in Hokkaido’s Siberian climate. Experime nts must be tended to four times a day, from eight in the morning until eight at night, seven days a week, without a holiday or a weekend off."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" He describes these travails, but he does not dw ell on them, or the controversy and politics. He revels in the fun parts of cold fusion: the di scovery, the sense of wonder, the rewards. Mizuno does not waste his time moping or worrying. He gets to work, he does experiments, he teaches and encourages students. The first 5,000 copy pr inting of this book sold out quickly in Japan. Mizuno was thrilled because, he told me, “ undergrads are buying it, and calling me with questions.” He and I wanted to move the Sixth International Conference on Cold Fusion (ICCF6) out of the isolated mountaintop resort hotel in Hokkaido, back to the city of Sapporo, and into the grubby Student Union meeting hall on campus. We wanted to open up the conference and allow free admission to students. We think that when engineering and physic s majors drift into such conferences and realize what is happening, cold fusion will take off. Despite the troubles, Mizuno remains confid ent that we will succeed in the end. The research will be allowed, papers will be pub lished, rapid progress will be made. Others, like Fleischmann, are deeply pessimistic . Some of the best scientists in this field, including Storms, are deeply discouraged by the constant struggle and expense. Th ey sometimes tell me they are on the verge of quitting. But Mizuno has never flag ged, never doubted and never lost hope. As Storms says “we must have hope, we ha ve no other resources in this field.” Mizuno wants to make practical devices. He wants to improve reproducibility and scale up. He talks about the scientist’s obligation to give society some thing of value. He and Dennis Cravens are the only cold fusion sc ientists I know who say that. He succeeded in replicating the original Pons and Fleischmann palladium cold fusion in three experime nts, but it was difficult and the reaction proved impossible to control, so he did not see much future in it. Instead of trying to improve the original experiment by re peating it many times with minor variations, the way McKubre, Kunimatsu and others have attemp ted, Mizuno decided to try other materials and other approaches. He is a one-man R&D consor tium. Some may critici ze him for trying too many things and spreading himself too thinly. As I see it, Mizuno is doing his share. The rest of the world is to blame for not following his lea d. He worked on ceramic proton conductors for years, he published detailed information in pr ofessional, full-length papers, and he assisted Oriani by fabricating a batch of conductors for h im (a week of difficult labor on Oriani’s behalf). No other scientist has been as cooperative, willin g to share data, and willing to assist others replicate. If Mizuno has left jobs unfinis hed, others should have taken up these jobs. Mizuno concentrates on the re wards, the progress, the heady sense of excitement, the breathtaking possibilities. If progress has been slow, it has been real, and the scope of the research has broadened immeasurably. In 1989 we thought we had stumbled onto one isolated uncharted island. It turned out we have discovered a whole new con tinent. No wonder our exploration of it is taking longer than we expected. Over the years I have asked many scientists where cold fusion may be taking us and how big the discovery might be. Only Martin Fleischmann has shown a deep understanding of how many ramifications it may have."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Mizuno describes few moments of epiphany. There are moments of excitement, but most of the triumphs are long expected, and a good result does not mean much until you make it happen again, and again after that. There are fe w revelations. The scientists do not suddenly grasp the answer. They gradually narrow down a se t of possibilities. Often the same possibilities are examined, discounted, and then reconsidered years later. Recen tly, Mizuno, Bockris and others have increasingly focused on so-called “h ost metal transmutations,” that is, nuclear reactions of the cathode metal itself. The cathode metal was in explicably neglected for many years. The term “host metal” is misleading. It was an unfortunate choice of words. It implies that the metal acts as a passive structure, holding the hydrogen in place, cramming the deuterons or protons together. The metal is a host, not a pa rticipant. The hydrogen does the work. Now, it appears the metal itself is as active as the hydrog en. The metal apparently fissions and fusions in complex reactions. Now the task is to think about the metal, and not just the hydrogen. Theory must explain how palladium can turn part of itself into copper and other elements with peculiar isotopes. One of the few “Eureka!” events in this book is the moment when Mizuno and Ohmori saw the scanning electron microscope images of the beautiful lily-shaped eruptions on the surface of Ohmori’s gold cathodes. This was visu al proof that a violent reaction takes place under the surface of the metal, vaporizing the meta l and spewing it out. Later, these vaporized spots were found to be the locus of transmuta tion. Around them are gathered elements with an isotopic distribution that does not exist in nature. The only likel y explanation is that these isotopes are the product of a nuclear transmutation. Mizuno describes the wrong directions he ha s taken, the dead ends, the mistakes. For years he ignored the most important clue: the host metal transmutations. He did not check the composition of the used cathodes. After his fi rst big success produced tritium and spectacular heat-after-death, he opened the cell to find th e cathode was blackened by something. He thought it must be contamination, and he was disappoint ed that his painstaking efforts to exclude contamination had failed. After puzzling over it for a long time he scraped the black film off the cathode with glass, and prepared the cathode for a nother run. Years later he realized that this black film was probably formed from microsc opic erupted structures similar to those on Ohmori’s cathodes. He says in retrospect he was throwing away treasure. Even Mizuno, an open minded, observant and perceptive scie ntist, has to be hit over the head with the same evidence many times before he realizes it is crucial. Ot her people are worse. Mizuno was blind for a long time; other cold fusion scientists remain blind to this day. They are unwilling to do simple tests that might reveal the nature of the reaction. IMRA is a sad example. Informed sources say IMRA researchers never performed an au toradiograph on a used cathode. A recurring theme in this book is money. Mizuno frets, schemes and struggles to reduce expenses. He worries about the consumption of heavy water at $8 or $10 per day. He does not reveal in the book why these trivial expenses bot her him so much: most of the money comes out"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" of his own pocket. University discretionary fundi ng allotted to professors in Japan does not begin to cover the expense of cold fusion research. It would be called “noise level funding” in the U.S., or “sparrow’s tears” in the Japanese idiom. Most of the other professors at Hokkaido remain hostile toward this research, and unwilling to a llocate more money for it, so Mizuno often pays for equipment, materials, travel expenses and so on himself. Over the years the research has cost him tens of thousands of dollars, which is a gr eat deal of money for a middle-class Japanese family. Cold fusion research consumes a cons tant flow of new equi pment. The Japanese scientific establishment and the uni versity barely tolerate this re search. Still, Mizuno is better off than he would be at most U.S. universities, which have essentially banned this research. Mizuno describes the dank, underground laborat ory. He does not mention that his own laboratory is the size of a broom closet and so crammed with equipment you can barely fit in the door. The roof leaks. A large sheet of blue plastic is suspended over th e corner of the room, funneling the rain water down to a sink and away from the com puters, meters, power supplies and complex, delicate, beautiful handcrafted experimental apparatus, made of aluminum, stainless steel, platinum, palladium, gold and silver.
