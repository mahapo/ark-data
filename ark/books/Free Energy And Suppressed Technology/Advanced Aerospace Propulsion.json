Why mainstream propulsion physics cannot accept that they are real. In 1989, I asked Dr. Van Landingham “Has NASA made contact with an extraterrestrial civilization?” He answered, “No. When you consider how much ener gy it would take, in the form of propulsion, to get a spacecraf t up to 99% of the speed of light (186, 282 mps), the energy signal radiating from that craf t would be so massive, every radio astronomer, amateur and professional, would see the signal well in advance of the arrival of the spacecraft, and we have never seen anything like that yet.” An event like this could never be hidden from amateur radio astronomers. We would all see the craft coming in towards Earth for many years prior to their arrival. It has never happened in this way. This we deduct is because either the UFO phenomenon is an illusion or the ETs are doing it another way. CHAPTER I – THE PROBLEMS AND LI MITATIONS OF INCREASING ENERGY ON MASS (AIR & SPACECRAFT) WI TH CURRENT ROCKET AND ION- PROPULSION SYSTEMS. As our current approaches towards propulsion rely on using rocket fuels, futuristic ion propulsion systems (nuclear pr opulsion), worm holes and grav ity theories (e xotic), if we consider Einstein’s increase mass law (the faster mass travels, inertia increases its mass thus it gets heavier and more and more energy is required to accelerate towards the speed of light), the energy required to attain 99.99% of the speed of light (according to particle accelerator studies) is 1 TeV or greater. This is the energy required in the form of charged particles, such as ion pro pulsion or anti-proton propulsion systems. Dr. Van Landingham stated in 1989 that at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, studies were being done into an ti-proton propulsion systems. He was particularly interested in Dr. Bogdan C. Maglich’s D+Heliu m-3 fusion reactor design due to its low radioactivity and pow er source that converts directly to electricity obviating the heat cycle common to most nuclear ener gy conversions. D+Helium-3 fusion produces 18MeV charged protons ideal to produce veloc ities in anti-proton propulsion drives up to 1/10 th the speed of light (67 million mph). Considering the 60% energy loss comm on to most nuclear fuels thermal conversion to charged particle energy, the real ity of ever attaining 1TeV or greater anti- proton or ion propulsion drives is not possible with any of the known nuclear fuels in the Periodic Table of Elements. In fact, 1 TeV is never found in any of the nuclear fuels in the Periodic Table, in the form of heat or in charged particles. It is not possible. 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"If we consider the negative energy required to produce a wormhole with a narrow funnel (Kip Thorn, Caltech), equal to the negative energy of a hundred thousand suns for one year, ideas of attaining energy levels that high are also fi ctitious, and would be evident if the ETs were doing it this way. They are not evident. This again would mean that either the UFO phenomenon is an illu sion or the ETs are attaining propulsion velocities at the speed of li ght or greater another way. Considering exotic gravity drive syst ems (enveloping a spacecraft in its own gravity envelope) we have to consider that in order to counteract the forces of gravity from suns, stars and planets, the “Mass-Gr avity Effect” of the enveloped craft would have to be greater than that of the planet or sun it is competing with. That increase in the mass-gravity effect of the craft would destroy any mass spacecraft and pilot with G- Forces beyond the capacity to survive. If we consider that even if we con tinue on our current a pproach to propulsion drive systems by increasing energy on mass via more powerful rocket fuels, and exotic ion propulsion systems and anti-proton propulsion systems, a pilot would be destroyed either the by the increase of the pilot’s mass (E instein) with linear acceleration, or further destroyed if at for example 1/10th the speed of light (67 million mph), the pilot had to turn to avoid an incoming asteroid or planet , the G-Force would de vastate the pilot and destroy the mass of the craft. CHAPTER II – A REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH “REDUCING MASS-GRAVITY EFFECT BY WAVE TRANSFORMATION OF MASS” How this paper will propose the answer as to how UFOs are breaking the laws of propulsion physics without violating Einstein’s laws Abstract Considering the impossibility of any of the current approaches to propulsion at realistic attainment of the speed of light or beyond due to the impossible effects of inertial mass increases with increased veloci ty, also mass-gravity-effects increases with gravity enveloping, and impossible energy re quired to get mass (spacecraft) towards 99% the speed of light, let alone Einstein’s limit at “c,” the new theory will explore how to “Reduce the Mass-Gravity Effect” of a spacecraft and pilot towards “Zero.” If, by exotic theory (Started by Davi d Sereda in 2000), a spacecraft’s “Mass- Gravity Effect” can be reduced to zero fi rst, before mobilizing propulsion energy, the energy required to attain th e speed of light and beyond (for a Zero-Mass Gravity Effect Spacecraft) in an Einstein formula would be so small, near zero energy, that the final conclusion would be that it (the UFO) woul d not be detectable as Dr. Van Landingham suggested it should be consideri ng Einstein’s law: at 1 TeV or greater. In fact, it would be invisible as mass, but detect able somewhere in the EM spectrum, even the invisible, 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"as a Zero-Mass-Gravity Effect Spacecraft. Fu rther, the theory could prove how energy can no longer be an issue in propulsi on, rather it is an obstacle. Understanding Gravity as an Effect After getting completely frustrated with the impossible energies required to get mass toward 99% the speed of light, and th e current approaches being impossible, the only logical alternative in the game of process of elimination, is to explore this new idea that the mass-gravity-effect is just that: an e ffect and not a solid reality. That effect can be weakened or increased. UFOs defy Mass-Gravity-Effect Considering some of the maneuvers of UFOs (sudden acceleration, sudden stops or sharp angular turns all at high velocities, and invisibility), thei r behavior can only be explained by the idea of a craft having attained a zero-mass-gravity effect state. Because only at zero-mass-gravity effect can a pilot or spacecraft experience Zero G-force at such high velocity turning, stopping and sudden acceler ation. Invisibility can be understood with the same principles later in this paper. This has to be the way they are doing it. Photons defy Mass-Gravity-Effect When we observe natural phenomena such as all objects, regardless of their mass, falling towards Earth’s gravity at the same velocity (Newton, Galileo), and that light waves (photons) can escape Earth’s Gravity (t hus not affected by Earth’s Gravity enough to bound them to Earth), Photons (and their wa ve state) are capable of experiencing anti- gravity. In this paper, we will study the wave-p article state of photons and their alleged Zero-Mass-Gravity Effect state versus mass and its gravity state to search for differences and clues into how it may be possible to cause mass to reduce its mass-gravity effect. We will look at both light and mass in all four Einstein dimensions (visually) and challenge discoveries of the mass-gravity effect in both the quantum world and the astrophysical model to find a major disagreeme nt. This major disagreement will open the door to proving that the “Mass-Gr avity Effect” is not as consistent as it appears and that it can be reduced or increased by changing the wave state of mass. If we can theoretically prove that the Mass-Gravity Effect can be reduced in a single atom, and by observations that have alr eady been made in particle physics (but overlooked), then experimentation can be done to try and duplicate the transformation. A – LOOKING AT ALL WAVE-PAR TICLE RELATIONSHIPS IN ALL 4 DIMENSIONS VERSUS THE CURRENT 2- D (3-D includes Time) MODEL with (OSCILLOSCOPES) 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" In order to make proper observations about the wave-particle relationship of mass versus light to search for the answer as to how to reduce the Mass-Gravity-Effect, we will have to go beyond current models (oscillosc opes, 2 and 3-D models on paper) used to analyze and study waves and particles. We n eed to search for the answer by looking at particle-wave pairs visually in all four of Einstein’s dimensions. Even when we analyzed early experiments of how waves move over the surface of water, we did the work on a two-dimensi onal sheet of paper and had to calculate the third spatial dimension plus time. By not actually looking at all 4 dimensions, we miss the hidden secrets. For example, let us l ook at the waves on the surface of water on the current model, versus all 4 dimensions to s ee what is missing (see diagram Chapter II – A and B). Chapter II – A Diagram Chapter II – B Diagram Chapter II – A Diagram we can see how waves radiate or migrate away from the point of origin (the point where a pebble is dropped into a lake) across a two-dimensional page. It is classic, but very flawed. The two dimensional page does not include that the surface of the water is not flat. That is a ra ther myopic view of the water. If we move out into space, we can clearly see that the su rface of the Earth is curved, and so is the 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"surface of any body of water. That means when we drop the pebble into the water, the pebble continues below the surface of the water and spins as the Earth is spinning, send out spiraling waves towards the surface of th e water. As the surface wave moves across the curved surface of the water, it is not only moving over the surface (spreading itself out), but it is propagating in a curvature over the sphere and will move forwards (inwards) simultaneously across the surface. It will max out at the largest circumference of the Earth (resonate through land mass – encounter resistance) but its left-over weak force will eventually spiral towards smaller a nd smaller orbits across the sphere and come to a point as small as the point of origin where the pebble was first dropped into the water. In all 4 dimensions, the wave has many aspects compared to the 2-D model (plus time): 1. Forward Propagation 2. Lateral Propagation 3. Spiral Spin Velocity 4. Amplitude 5. All 3 encounter Earth’s Rotation Spin 6. The Solar System’s Spin 7. The Galaxy’s Spin With this new awareness, the wave- partic le -effect of just dropping a pebble in a lake, has many dimensions to explore to sear ch for answers to the original question: What is the wave state of mater versus light ? This exploration is going to reveal the hidden clue and theorize where the missing Gr aviton is, What really happened in the Big Bang that we cannot see in the curre nt model, Black Holes, Sub-Atomic explosions, and their contradictions with Einstein’s theory on Gravity and Black Holes. INTRODUCTION TO THE NEW “GALA XY CLOCK” 4-D WAVE-PARTICLE CLOCK FOR MEASURING ALL WAVE -PARTICLE RLEATIONSHIPS FROM QUANTUM TO ASTROPHYSICAL MODELS Will take a new look at: Einstein’s 4 dimensions Schrodinger’s wave -experiment on water in all 4 dimensions Niels Bohr in all 4 dimensions Using the Galaxy Clock model, finding the missing particle (the Graviton”) in the differential between the anti-particle and pa rticle pairs. Merging the Gravity and electromagnetic forces into One Theory. Einstein’s 4 dimensions – Another approach While Einstein’s 4 dimensions appear to fit into a square box (Height, Width, Depth, Time), we forget to mention that when we add Time, the forth Dimension, all points in 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the 4 dimensions are curved; and that those cu rvatures eventually spiral into concentric orbits, which have frequency. For example, if we take any point of a pe rson standing on the earth over time, the point where the person exists will spin around with the turning of the earth (one revolution per day - a curvature); the earth in turn sp ins around the sun (one revolution per year - another curved path); which in turn, the so lar system spins around the Galaxy (every 250 million years – another curved path). Wave -particle spins within multiple wave-particle relationships. If we follow any pint in the 4 dimensions over time, from a half a second to 250 million years, we will find that the wave path of the particle-wave relationship will reveal itself to be a curvature over short moments of time, a nd concentric circles or spirals over longer periods of time. My point in showing this corre ction to the model is that while making any observations in a square or flat model, we are not seeing the truth. The truth is that we do not observe any flat spaces, just very long and subtle curvatures. Schrodinger’s Wave Experiment on Water in 4 – dimensions If we examine the very earliest experiments done on wave patterns caused by dropping a pebble into a still pond or lake, we can see how waves propagate over what appears to be a flat surface in diagram A below.   Diagram A Showing Waves rippling over water But if we examine the waves in all 4 di mensions including time, we can see that the added dimension reveals the flaw that the waves are not propagating over a flat surface. As we look at the next diagram B, we can see the reality immediately. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Pebble Drops in Lake or Ocean Diagram B Shows Waves moving in 4 curved Dimensions All of this is just to prepare us to ma ke the observation involving the answer to many of the problems in physics today, st arting with the missing particle: the “Graviton.” Any lake or pond can appear flat in the mind, but in reality the earth is curved and the wave is moving over a curved surface. Just keep thins thought in mind when making any observations that are going to get more complicated, from Electromagnetic waves, light wa ves, brain waves, sound wave s, atomic waves, etc. Niels Bhor’s Hydrogen Atom in 4 dimensions By 1915, Niels Bohr’s hydrogen atom re vealed a model that proved the energy levels of the atom, caused by minor shifts in the electron, could shift. When the electron spinning around the proton jumped to a shell further away from the atom’s center, the atom would gain energy. Niels Bohr also not ed that when the electron jumped to an orbiting shell closer to the center, it radiated off (lost) energy. David Sereda: Looking at the atom in a ll 4 dimensions, when the particle-wave relationship of the electron jumps to a shell further out, it’s frequency (counted by revolutions around the electron per second) beco mes lower. As we will learn later, lower frequency particle-wave relationshi ps yield greater mass particles. Higher frequency wave-particle relationshi ps yield lower mass particles. In Niels Bohr’s experiment, in an Einstein equation, if the electron gained energy by shifting to a lower frequency shell (furth er out), it gained mass. That means in relation to gravity, it’s mass- gravity effect increased. Niels Bohr also noted that when the elect ron jumped to an orbiting shell closer to the center, it radiated off its energy. If it radiated off its energy by jumping to a higher frequency wave-particle relations hip, its mass-gravity effect would also be reduced. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" I think the Niels Bohr experiment pr oves something so shocking in a quantum model, that it was overlooked. We will get more into the precise meaning of this discovery as this paper evolves. But if Bohr’s hydrogen atom tells us that the mass-gravity effect of an atom can be altered even slightly, then what would happen if it was altered on a grander scale? Could we reduce the mass-gravity effect of atom s in steel aircraft or even ocean vessels? The Galaxy Clock 4-D Wave-particle Model  Phase I Galaxy Clock Designed to see wave-particle trails in all 4-dimensions, the Galaxy Clock model focuses mostly on the third spatial dimension of a wave (depth) because this is the angle of the wave that is missing in the Oscilloscope model. Because we do not actually see light waves, we are limited to studying their effects based on Einstein’s photo-electric eff ect. Because photons are said to be mass- less particles, they do not leave any trails in particle explosions captured in gas chambers or bubble chambers. Scintillation counters agai n only see their effect s. But scintillation counters are the best way to follow th eir wave formations and paths. I propose that deeper studies need to be done on the exact patterns that light waves travel in. I propose, based on the 4-d m odel, that they are all spinning waves with spiral spin velocity, forward propagation, angular momentum, and interference patterns with other waves. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" What is normally seen as a series of wave peaks (measured per second to determine Hertz), in oscilloscope models, the Galaxy Clock measures the spin velocity of a wave, counts the number of peaking re volutions at the 12:00 position, and also considers the diameter x 3.14 Pi ratios of waves. Amplitude and Frequency are merely simple aspects of the wave. Each second on the Clock (with all wave dimensions presented) reveals the distance light spins thr ough a wave at. Because this distance is a constant, we measure equal distances on each wheel or path that light spins through. Like seconds on a clock, light (photons) spin through their wave relationship at a constant speed, I predict at least 3.14 x C in or der to forward propagate at C. The Galaxy Clock first reveals that fr equency is determined by the number of oscillations per second. This is measured by th e spiral spin velocity and the diameter x Pi to determine how many times the particle will spin through the wave per second. For example, if two particle waves have the same diameter but different spin velocities, they will have different frequencies. The Galaxy Clock looks at a series of wave-particle paths with 10 different diameters. We can see that the smaller diam eter waves spin at a higher frequency than the larger ones. This starts to show us what higher frequency li ghts waves should really look like if we could see them. What we do not see in the Galaxy Clock model is the forward propagation dimension revealed in a 2-D model. It is easy to see that light waves obviously spin faster than they forward propagate at the speed of light. Even in this 2-D (plus Time) model, we can see that if a wave particle is moving through the wave from right to left at the speed of light, the velocity at 90 degrees away from its forwar d propagation is going to be faster than the speed of light. Because Einstein’s Relativity theory relies on the speed of light to be constant, it cannot detect the velocity at 90 degrees from forward propagation of a light wave. It remains invisible and unseen by the angle we measure events at. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" But considering that the 2-D model is incorrect, the light wave is actually spinning 90 degrees away from forward propaga tion at least 3.14 times the speed of light (C). Model of Light Wave Spinning faster than C All of this remains invisible to relativity. Perh aps this is why so much of the light wave remains invisible to detectors, and why we can only see the effects of light, without actually observing the wave pattern itself. Phase II Galaxy Clock 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" The Phase II Galaxy Clock reveals what happens when we draw a line through all of the second counts on each wheel. It st arts to resemble a galaxy and many other Fibonacci Spiral forms in nature. It is giving us a cl ue that the workings of nature are following the correct wave-particle paths rather than the false 2-D models used today. There are many problems that the Galaxy Clock can solve in physics today, but let us start with the Graviton, the missing pa rticle. We can then go on to a modern correction on Reducing the Mass-Gravity Eff ect, Black Holes, the Big Bang, Light Speed and Beyond, Time, etc. Where is the missing “Graviton” - Electromagnetism and Gravity Combined Einstein’s pupil tries to merge electromagnetism and gravity. It is an age old paradigm now to try and do this but no one can do it. Wh y? Because in order to do it we have to prove that ordinary mass has an electromagnetic charge on it. Mass is considered to have no charge on it because of the opposing force of the electron spin against the proton. If the proton spins positive and the electron spin s negative, they have to cancel each other out to zero. But we really di dn’t look at the idea of “differentials” defined as left over charges between the pairs of particles. If we look at the hydrogen atom again for exam ple, we can see that in all 4 dimensions, we have made a grave mistake. Hydrogen Atom 4-D If we look at this diagram of a hydroge n atom and consider the electron spinning counterclockwise from the 12:00 position and th e anti-electron spinning clockwise (near 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"the speed of light – the lightest mass part icle we know of)) from the 12:00 position, if they are the exact radial distance from the cen ter of the atom, they will collide at the 6:00 position in a single orbit. If this was ind eed what atoms have been doing, all of mater would annihilate before creation be gan. We would not be here. The same is true for the proton. Th e proton spins clockwise from the 12:00 position (much slower than the electron because of its grea t mass) and the anti-proton spins counterclockwise, they would annihilate at the 6:00 position in a single orbit. Because matter and antimatter are not anni hilating and we all exist, the particle and anti-particle pairs would ha ve to be at slightly differe nt radial distances from the center of the atom in order to pass by each ot her without a collision taking place. If this is true, then the inner most particle is in a higher frequency orbit than the outer most particle. Between them would be a sma ll left over charge of electromagnetism (differential) that is so small and so wea k, it could explain why gravity is such a weak force compared to the other nuclear forces. But in our search for the graviton, we are l ooking for a very weak force. It is only in the order of 10-38 times that of the str ong nuclear force. A strong force of gravity would cause all of creation to be annihilated as fast as the universe was born in a big bang. If we can prove that mass has a tiny, weak, electromagnetic charge on it, we can merge electromagnetism and gravity into a singl e TOE. This small number differential left over charge between particle and anti- particle pairs (the el ectron and anti-electron differential and the proton anti-pr oton differential) would also have to have another more subtle differential left over between them. This paired differential would create a vortex or even more subtle spiral wave pattern th at is the wave-particle I believe to be the graviton. It has even more substratum that are even more subtle and may play an important role in detecting the most subtle forces at play in creation. The history of radio, wireless transmissi on of information, telephones, etc., and television has shown us that we are able to tr ansform wave forms if we are first in phase with them. What will happen if we can first identify gravity waves, and then manipulate them? Will this be the opening to discover how anti-gravity propulsion physics operates? Proof that the “Differentia l” is the Missing Graviton In addition to my paper's revelation on the missing \"Graviton\" being found in the \"differential\" between the particle, anti-particle pairs, isn't the proof evident in the fact that gravity is the force between the earth's rotational centrifugal and centripetal forces? Isn't that too a differential? Isn't this proof that gravity being the manifestation between the earth's centrifugal and centripet al forces is a direct reflec tion of the quantum forces at play: being also a differential between particle and anti-particle pairs? 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"But then it occurred to me how to build the gravity generator: 1. Spin protons (or electrons for a weaker e ffect) clockwise in a field and another set counter-clockwise with one set being in a sli ghtly smaller radial or bit (higher frequency) than the other. This will allow for the \"differential\" to manifest between them. The differential is the \"gravity wave\" itself. 2. To manipulate the gravity wave, just widen the gap or differential by changing the radial (circumference) in the wave generator between the positive spin proton and the negative spin. The wider the gap the str onger the gravity wave you will create. This can then be used to manipulate gravity effects: lowering the mass-gravity-effect or raising it. This really needs experimentation! David Sereda B - COMPARING THE QUANTUM WAVE -PARTICLE-RELATIONSHIP OF THE GREATEST MASS PARTICLES TO THE LEAST (ELECTRON) IN PARTICLE COLLISSIONS with the Galaxy Cl ock 4-D wave-particle tool This is an independent study and observation I did into the compar ison of wave-particle relationships of the heaviest or greatest ma ss particles to the lightest mass particles in collisions that took place at 99- 99.99% the speed of light in pa rticle collisions. What I am looking for is to provide evidence that the lowest mass particle-waves are in higher frequency orbits than the heavier mass particle-wave relationships. We are looking to see if we find evidence in particle explosions consistent with what Niels Bohr found in the hydrogen atom: that when an electron jumps to a further out or longer wave length, the atom gains energy (mass), and when it jumps into a higher frequency orbit (closer in), the atom ra diates off its energy, reducing its mass. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Photo of free Electron Spiraling This photo from “The Particle Odyssey,” shows an electron changing its orbital diameter from a larger diameter to a smaller one. From page 37: Under the influence of a magnetic field, an electron in a cloud chamber spirals around some 36 times, producing a track ar ound 10 m long. The electron starts its life at the left of the picture, where it has been created together with an anti- electron or positron, by an invisible gamma ray. The electron’s spiral moves slowly across the page due to a slight va riation in the magnetic field. Notice how the spiral becomes significantly tighter about halfway across the picture. This is because the electron has lost energy by radiating a photon. In an Einstein equation, if the electron lost energy it lost mass energy equivalent and therefore reduced the mass-gravity effect . But this is just the beginning of understanding this because to reverse or cance l out gravity, we have to go much deeper. 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" P hoto of Particle Explosion Page 12 of Particle Odyssey This photo shows an array of particles in a collision from CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. From page 13 of “The Partic le Odyssey, the descrip tion of the explosions shows the same hidden data: The tracks of many charged particles are made visible in this image from the NA35 experiment at CERN, Geneva. The particles emerge from the collision of an oxygen ion with an atomic nucleus in a le ad target at the left of the image. Tiny luminous streamers reveal their tracks as they pass through an electrified gas and curve under the influence of a magne tic field, positive particles bending one way, negative particles the other. Most of the particles ar e very energetic, so their paths curve only slightly, but at least one particle ha s a lower energy, and it curls around several times in the detector, mimicking the shell of an ammonite. The key point here is again revealed, that greater energy particles curve “slightly,” and lower en ergy particles “curl arou nd several times.” If we round these orbits through a Gala xy Clock, we can see that the longer curved particles, of greater mass, will loop in to a full circle or decaying spiral with a longer wavelength or lower frequency than th e lower mass particle, which has a shorter wavelength or higher frequency. Galaxy Clock Model  Electrons Spiral in Small Orbits Using the Galaxy Clock, we can see that th e electrons in the photo on the right are in higher frequency orbits that the longer cu rves of the greater mass-energy particles. Lines that merely “appear” straight are subtly curved and will eventual ly oscillate in very long wavelengths. Just as the Earth was once thought to be flat, because its curve is so long, it later revealed itse lf as a curve. As long as we have waves, we have curvature. 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"All of spacetime is curved. This is why with Einstein’s 4 dimensional model, I cannot see any use in making observations with stra ight lines. They do not exist in real spacetime. The following photo of a particle explosion was very challenging for me to analyze. It shows a greater mass particle moving through a smaller spiral than expected to be consistent with my theory. The event is rare and marks an interesting outcome. Particle Explosion – Decay of Positive Pion From page 73 of “The Particle Odyssey: The decay of a positive pion is captured in a streamer chamber image of an anti- proton annihilating in the ne on gas filling the chamber. The antiproton comes in from the right (moving left to right) and interacts to produce a typical starburst of tracks. One of the positive pions curls around on the right in the camber’s magnetic field, before decaying into a muon, which forms a beautiful spiral. Eventually, the muon decays to a positron (an anti-electron). The masses of particles are given here in units of energy – million electron volts (MeV) or Giga electron volts (G eV). This is a shorthand for mass units of MeV/C2 or GeV/C2, where C is the veloci ty of light. The standard energy measurement is for a particle at rest, or not being accelerated, rather in its natural state. To accelerate any mass particle to 99.99% the speed of light, we alter its energy and require energies of 1 TeV (Trillion-terra electron Volts) or greater. Coming in from the right is the Anti-Proton, one of the greater mass particles we know of perhaps accelerated to a much greater energy than it is at re st. At rest it should be around 938.3 MeV. The collision decays to form Pions (the loop to the side of the main spiral). Pions have a mass-energy of 140 MeV (Million electron Volts), which is nothing compared to the mass of a proton a nd anti-proton at 938.3 MeV.

Strangely, neutrons have even greater mass at 939.6 GeV. Now how could a subcomponent of a proton, a Top Quark have a mass-energy greater than the proton itself ? Firstly you would have to accelerate a proton to 170 GeV before you could even observe the Top Quark. I propose that this is because the mass- energy and mass-gravity effect of atoms are not constant nor are they stable if they are manipulated. In this case, during a collis ion, we can separate a Top Quark from the proton and its mass-gravity effect changes to one that is far greater than the state it resided in while it was inside the proton. Why? What would happen if we take a part icle of greater mass and increase its frequency and spiral spin speed? In my theo ry, its mass-gravity effect should be reduced. All of the evidence points to that. But if a part icle of greater mass were to be forced into a magnetic field that made it spiral into a sm aller orbit with a slow spin velocity, its frequency (measured by revolutions around a lo op) would not increase, and it could keep its mass-energy in tact. In order to reduce th e mass-gravity of a particle, we have to have high-velocity (hopefully near C or greater) sp iral velocity in tandem with smaller and smaller diameter orbits. This increases fr equency successfully and that should reduce the mass gravity effect of the particle. In order to successfully reduce the mass-gr avity effect of a pa rticle, we have to manipulate the orbits of the particle and anti- particle pairs both. More will be clear on this later. Experiments need to be done in partic le accelerators on this by measuring the gravity effects on particle as they change frequency (frequency as described in the Galaxy Clock model). This has not been done with reducing the mass gravity effect in mind, but there are some confirmations that are not well understood. In Cloud chambers studies of cosmic rays, high energy gamma rays (photons) Suddenly gave birth to electron pos itron pairs (epos), which separated at high velocity. The positron then would approach a nother electron, and The two would disappear, being replaced by high energy (0.511 MeV) Photons. These experimental results show that matter (dual pairs of epos) can be born of high frequency gamma waves and then that matter (d ual pairs of epos) can also return back into light; thus reduce its mass gravity effect. This shows that on the Quantum level, this is possible. But there is other evidence th at is even more astounding. Written in Donald Hotson’s paper on Dirac’s Equation and the Sea of nega tive Energy we find an example of an atom actually transforming to the exact point of losing all of its mass-energy and disappearing 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"completely from relativity’s sight: When an electron spirals in to a closer orbit around the positron, they don’t just rush together and disappear. Instead, they approach until they are a distance apart that is the width of the electromagnetic gr ound state of hydrogen. At this relatively large distance (some 56,000 times the diamet er of a proton) they start to orbit around each other in a configuration called “positronium.” (This in itself should have told us that something other than annihilation was going on) They never get closer (radial distance) to each other than atomic distances. After orbiting each other in this pseudoatom for a time that de pends on whether their spins are parallel or opposed, they emit two or more photons that total all of their positive energy. After that they are no longer detectable, and conventional wisdom says that their charges and spins have “cancelled” and that they have annihila ted and are no more. But since they never got closer to each other than 56,000 times the diameter of the proton, how can they possibly cancel or anni hilate? They never get anywhere near each other, and nothing passes between them . For them to annihilate, would be action at a distance, a direct violation of causality. It couldn’t have been what happened. They could not have annih ilated as Dirac pointed out. This quantum model shows the moment a dual pair (proton-electron) gives off the totality of its energy, they disappear from Re lativity’s sight completely. That means they are vibrating too the pint of having a zero-mass gravity effect state that makes the atom as transparent to other photons as photons themselv es. Photons are not used to detect other photons. We don’t even see photons in cloud ch ambers, we see their effects. This quantum model is proof for the theory that I have set forth. It is happening in the quantum world, but conventional physics cannot even identify it because they did not have the theoretical model built. C – COMPARING THE RESULTS OF THE QUANTUM MODEL TO THE ASTROPHYSICAL MODEL (GALAXIES) AND UNIVERSAL MODELS with the Galaxy Clock tool. In Einstein’s relativity, we observe that since the inception of the “Big Bang,” and at the current rate of expansion of the universe, we can only observe 5-10%% of the mass; leaving 90% as “missing mass.” In the work I did on the Galaxy Clock model of the Galaxy itself, let alone the universe, we have the same problem. 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" As we take any point or solar system body in any Galaxy and follow it over time, we can see that the position of the point or body is spiraling inwards with each revolution around the galactic core. In the Milky Way galaxy, we make one revolution every 250 million years. As a wave, this is a frequency of “one” every 250 million years: such a low frequency wave that no living one person could actually live to measure it peak even a single time. According to the observations made on the quantum model (Niels Bohr 1913 and David Sereda 2000), we can see that if the astrophysical model is the same as the quantum model, the mass-gravity effect has to be re ducing as the position of each solar system body spirals into a higher frequency orbit m oving towards the galact ic core or “Black Hole.” This is in opposition to Einstein’s view that mass is increasing as the galactic mass is absorbed by a Black Hole. But before we even get to the Black Hole, we have to ask that if all of this mass is heading towards the “Event Horizon,” where does it go? Why doesn’t it all get piled up so far, and backed up so badly, that it inhibits the incoming mass from moving ever steadily towards its core with no resistance? If there were even the slightest resistance, the spiral arms of the Galaxy would get crunched and crinkled as the spin velocity of the mass-wave relationship slowed down. They don’ t slow down at all. That means the mass just keeps flowing towards an infinite absorption point. I could never accept that the Black Hole was just cramming mass into itself with no point of even the slightest amount of resistance to that absorption unless th ere was a flaw in the operation of Black Holes and Galactic Cores. This new theory that I am putting forth is paramount to discovering propulsion physics of UFOs and reducing the mass-gravity effect of a spacecr aft towards an infinite zero point. 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" With the quantum model showing all evidence of the shorter the wavelength of a wave- particle (mass) relationship, the higher its frequency (when spin velocity is constant), and the lower the mass of the particle, why would a Galaxy, which is following the same model, be not only opposite, showing mass to be increasing, but appear to produce observable results that could be explained by Relativity? Because we know that a proton has a much gr eater amount of mass than an electron, and it is closer to the center of the atom than th e electron, it would seem that it should be in a higher frequency state than an electron. But the proton, we know, does not spin anywhere near the velocity th at an electron does. It has a much greater mass and should therefore be spinning at a much slower rate. D – NEW REVALATIONS ON BLACK HOLES – THE “MASS-GRAVITY REDUCING EFFECT” If “Black Holes” are reducing the mass-gravity effect (weight = mass x gravity), then the “apparent weight” charge of stars and planet ary bodies are being reduced towards zero as they approach the infinite zero point mass of a “Black Hole.” As bodies get lighter, it takes less energy to move them around. This would explain why Black Holes can devour whole planetary bodies, stars, gases, and all of mass with such apparent ease: because they no longer weigh anything comparable to what they appeared to weigh from our vantage point in the galaxy. Weight then becomes the greatest illusion in calculating the observable effects of Black Holes. Because gr avity is now reduced to an effect, Einstein assumed that Black Holes must have more ma ss-energy to produce the gravity needed to devour the massive bodies (as we understand them) from our position in the Galaxy. If my new theory is correct , we should observe an in crease in higher frequency wavelengths as we approach the event horizon of a Black Hole, and that we do: more X- rays and more gamma rays are observed. This is because, I predict, planetary and star bodies are being transformed into a mu ch higher frequency wave form. I could never accept Einstein’s theory on Black Holes due to this single fact: that mass could increase and the inflow of mass could flow without an y resistance as that mass was cramming itself into the Black Hole. Ther e had to be resistance, and the resistance would back up the flow of mass (trying to ente r the Black Hole) so badly that the spiral arms of the galaxy would cri nkle and collapse. When the mass-gravity effect of a planet or star body reduces toward s zero, it starts to accelerate in frequency and velocity; and at the “Event Horizon,” it accelerates beyond the speed of light (it will be easier to understand beyond light speed by the end of this paper). This allows for the infinite amounts of mass that enter a black hole to flow without causing resistance (back-lashing waves) to the incoming mass-particle waves. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"But this has to be studied for precise observa ble indications to determine just what level the mass-gravity effect of the planetary bodies are being transformed into (at what rate their mass-gravity effect is reducing). I was astounded to read an article posted on CNN that confirms my prediction: that mass in a high frequency state, at the core of a black hole can travel faster than the speed of light. The only way this could be true, that mass could travel faster than the speed of light exiting a black hole, is if my theory is correct. http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/ space/10/03/black.holes/index.html To understand “Beyond light Speed,” the followi ng chapters will build the case in point to the theory presented herein. The Big Bang If we start with a center of a Black Hole as an infinitely small point, as pre-existent to the “Big Bang” model, and we consider the partic le-wave relationship of that point would be of the highest frequency, the Universal Mode l would appear to have started with no mass at all, and as those wavelengths became l onger, mass-gravity was being formed, and the apparent mass of the universe was born. With this advantage, mass is also observed only an effect, just as gravity is. Time is the big one, but we have to wait to get into that one. It is a whopper, if you run it through the Galaxy Clock. It appears that all events have already happened, but time prevents us from experiencing what has already happened. E – THE DISSAGREEMENT ON THE RE SULTS REVEALS THE HIDDEN CLUE If the observations made by Einstein on the effect s of gravity in this region of the galaxy are not the same as they are, in effect, at th e center of the galaxy, then the hidden clue is that the mass-gravity effect is not constant throughout the galaxy and the universe. Its effect changes due to the amplitude (volum e), spin velocity, frequency, and the complex relationship of particle-anti-particle pairs. The hidden clue then is that if the mass-gr avity effect is not a constant and can be observed to be changeable in astrophysical models, then it should be able to be manipulated in spacecraft for propulsion concepts. F – STUDYING HOW THESE NEW RESULTS COULD BE APPLIED TO MASS AND AERO-SPACE CRAFT TO REDUCE MASS-GRAVITY EFFECTS AND HIGH- VELOCITY INERTIAL MASS INCREASES. If we can reduce the mass-gravity effect of solid steel, and spacecraft mass, towards an infinite zero point, then we can reduce th e amount of energy needed to accelerate a 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"spacecraft towards an infinite velocity. A ttaining light speed would be much more realistic if it were not an issue of attaini ng unrealistic energy leve ls; rather by reducing the energy required for propulsion. If the mass-grav ity effect is reduced to a near zero level, the energy required to attain the speed of light would be near zero. This is a revelation. If spacecraft and pilot could be reduced to a zero-mass gravity effect, the profundity of attaining the speed of light woul d be so realistic, the probl em of searching for excessive energy theories would be over. Large fuel supplies weighing down spacecraft for interstellar voyages would al so not be an issue (propellant mass problem). There are two ways that reduc ing the mass-gravity effect ca n allow for a spacecraft to conquer light speed and to redu ce inertial mass increases. Th e inertial mass increases are due to the spacecraft impeding on the backgr ound mass of space (even though it appears invisible). Just as a boat impedes itself agai nst water as it tries to accelerate, and a jet impedes itself against air mass as it tries to accelerate, so a sp acecraft impedes itself against the background mass of space. The issue of the void of space being mass less was solved when Einstein resolved Max Planck’s argument that the void was supercharg ed with zero-point energy. If the void is supercharged with energy, in an Einstein equation, it is supercharged with mass-energy. If we observe how waves appear first on the boat-water model, we can see that waves on the surface and depth of water appear to travel in clumps, with peaks and valleys. This shows us that the forces that cause waves, are pulsed: wind, action, gravity (sun, earth and moon), earth spin, earth quakes, etc. Wind, Solar, Gravitational, Seismic, Earth Spin – All pulsed   Because all of the forces in nature that cau se waves to appear are pulsed wave-particle pairs themselves, or caused by them (peaks and valleys), they are as if timed. Even the water itself is a timed wave-particle pair made of hydrogen and oxygen (wave-particle pairs). 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"If we see everything as just waves and particle s, we can see that because waves come in clumps, there has to be a high-resistance phase of a wave-particle pair and a low- resistance phase of a wave-particle pair or if we look even closer, on a quantum level, there is a gap between waves. This “gap” is what I am interested in. It is the resistance phase of a wave that cau ses inertia to impede on a boat, aircraft or spacecraft as it tries to accelerat e. As any of these craft accelerate, they are going to collide with a higher frequency of resistance phases of the waves or mass they are trying to fight against to accelerate. But what would happen if we could “tim e tune” the frequency of the mass (wave- particle) of the spacecraft itself as it tries to fight against the oncoming resistance phases of the waves it is propagating through?    Spacecraft as wave-form moving through Space as Waveform Both are Pulsed & Timed To first see the background of space as a mass- particle waveform, with timed waves, we can see immediately how to overcome inertia. While Einstein initially disagreed with Max Planck that the void of space had energy in it, he did this because if space were seen as a void of mass, then how could there be energy, if there is no mass. But 10 years later, Einstein reversed his decision. The fabric of space had to have mass, therefore energy. If we “time” the waves of the craft itself to be in phase with the non-resistance phase or “gap” (resistance phase is the peak – non-resi stance phase is the valley) in between the oncoming waves , the craft will encounter less and less inertia and be able to pass through the resistance of the background space-ma ss and accelerate faster and faster until it comes up against finer and finer waves of resist ance that also have finer tuned “gaps” that 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"can be attuned to. The finer tuned the spacecra ft’s wave state becomes, it can eventual y pass through any and all of the resisting waves th at cause inertia in the first place. This is what happens as the spacecraft become s a much higher frequency waveform. Just as x-rays (extremely high frequency waves) pass right thr ough solid objects (solid objects being low frequency wave forms), so the spacecraft in its higher frequency wave form can pass through the resistance of space mass causing inertia. If we send low frequency radio waves at a so lid brick wall, very few of those waves will pass through the wall while most will be absorb ed by the wall or deflect off of the wall. As we send higher and higher frequency waves at the wall, more and more of them will penetrate the wall. Gamma rays are so high in frequency, they pass through the wall even faster and with more frequency than x-rays. This shows that the higher the frequency of the wave form, the less inertia that waveform encounters. Counting Wave Experiment This is where things get complicated. Becau se space is also a timed wave form, and we rely on relativity to see and experience reality in this 4-dimensional reality, we can only witness the events of photons that remain pres ent in our dimension. This next model will show how higher frequency wave forms literally vanish into a higher dimension passing through the non-resistance phase of the background of space. Sunlight source of waves-photons & Space Waves-mass Higher Frequency Photons pass “throu gh” the “gap” in Space-Mass Waveform The photons that bounce off of the peaks or re sistance phase of the wave form of space mass, remain visible to relativity.

These photons actually overcome the inertia of this di mensions and accelerate faster than light speed but because they are invisible to it, they cannot be counted. It is if we, in our 4 dimensions, can on ly observe the photons that remain in our dimensions. Those that pass through the ot her side of the brick wall (the background of space) are undetectable to us. Th ey enter the next dimension. If a spaceship is in a higher frequency wave fo rm, it also remains invisible to relativity. This is one of the ways that spacecraft go undetected by relativity but are able to jump into our dimension. G – UFOs EXHIBIT EVIDENCE OF MASS-PARTICLE (SPACECRAFT) WAVE RELATIONSHIP – using real photo graphs to illustrate. The following photos of UFOs were taken by Ed West - estei@qwest.net - in Spokane, Washington, in the year 2002. I was particularly interested in them because of the very clear wave forms that these UFOS exhibited.  Photo #1 Shows “Plasmatic” quality Photo #2 shows wave formations And a non-solid nature of the UFO inside the plas matic effect of the UFO  28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Photo #3 shows a UFO taken at 1/250 th of a second revealing a definite wave-particle appearance. Notice the particle s (balls of light) are in pairs left of center and also right of center. Notice that the balls of light (a nd their tracks) are not the same frequency? We can determine this because the diameters of their tracks are not the same (one wider the other more narrow) ; thus th e narrow track is higher in frequency than the wider track. This suggests the same aspects of the particle-a nti-particle pairs in an atom being slightly out of phase with each other; and thus I proposed that the differential between the particle-anti-particle pairs is the missing “graviton.” As the shuttle speed clicks for 1/250 th of a second, the UFO is moving left to right. From the left, the greater wave formation is higher in frequency (smaller diameter x pi) than it is at the right where the frequency is sl owing down (larger diameter x pi). The fact that both pairs reveal a distance between the balls of light suggests that they are slightly different in frequency and diameter x pi. This is exactly how I propose the particle and anti-particle pair s inside an atom to be. But there is an even more subtle observati on in the photograph: In an atom, the particle spins opposite to the direction of the anti-particle; proton clockwise and anti-proton spins anti-clockwise. The electron spins anti-clockw ise and the anti-electron spins clockwise. This depends on which way you observe an atom, front or back side.  Both of these Spokane UFOs show strong wave formations, revealing clearly what this is all about. Analysis I believe the UFO may have the ability to cause the particle-anti-particle pairs to spin both as positive (becoming singular) just as a theoretical “uni-pole.” If this could happen, it would allow mass to go at the spee d of light and beyond. The particle-anti- particle pairs would still have a difference in diameter, and spinning at the same spin velocity, they would be out of phase; just as th ey appear in the UFO wave formation here. I do not believe we are actually see the UFO its elf, rather, just the effects of the wave formations from the UFO. 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Once particle-anti-particle pairs both spin positive or negative, they overcome the duality that keeps matter bound from overcoming inertia .

The wider a wave is x pi, the longer its wavelength is , the lower its frequency is (assuming the spin velocity of the wave-particle is constant). If we go to the bottom frame, we can see the ring-wave is now a smaller diameter, meaning it has changed to a higher frequency than the middle frame. The top frame shows a spiraling wave spiraling inwards. This reveals the same progression, but in an accelerated mode, that the wave-particle pa irs are changing frequency from a lower state to a higher one. Analysis The NASA UFO wave formations are consistent with what we observed in the Spokane UFO; revealing a transformation from lowe r to higher frequencies and back again. Because mass is dual charged with particle-anti- particle pairs, its overall frequency state and wave state have very little electromagnetic force. In fact, most physicists think it has no overall force. But why then do photons and electrons exchange forces in mass if there is no force in the atom that give it an electromagnetic charge? It has to have its ch arge, but now we know that it is cancelled out. If we can cause both th e particle and anti-particle pairs of mass to spin positive, mass would have a huge elec tromagnetic force. How do we do this? We are getting close to that now. If we look and observe real videotape of UFOs and their “spinning waves,” we can clearly see that the waves are not spi nning faster then the speed of light, not spinning at the speed of light, but much slower: exactly where I would predict the “differential” wave between the par ticle-anti-particle pairs to be spinning at. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"  This UFO shows a UFO captured on video in Venice, CA in the Spring of 2004 In the video, we can see the consistent UFO-wave evidence again. The UFO appeared to be strobe-pulsing with waves of energy that ac tually distort and blur the structure of the UFO itself. The energy waves are spinning so fast that as visi ble photons bounce off of the waves around the UFO, they distort its imag e to an observer. If the UFO waves spin faster than the speed of light, the UFO woul d become invisible as photons from the sun would be captured and thrown off at such a steep angle, no one coul d observe it head on. This may be possible for our own aircraft in making them stealthier.  This frame from the Venice UFO shows a clear tr iangle in the lower right of center as if part of a sphere and then a series of wave-panels surrounding a central sphere. The UFO is pulsing with waves that make it appear blu rry. This is caused, I believe, because the waves deflecting off most of the photons from the sun at steep angles. Most importantly, there is a consistency in real UFO propulsion systems: no rocket engines, no thrusters of any kind, just waves.

But George Van Tassel claimed to be receiving telepathic messages from a space being known as Ashtar. I am so astounded by what Ashtar allegedly told him in 1958, from Trevor James Constable’s book, “The Cosmic Pulse of Life” (1976): “For the information of your scientific minds throughout the planet, Shan, our ventlas (ships) do not spin. The emanati on of spiral radiation from our ships gives the illusion of spinning....” This first point is just the beginning of Ashtar’s transmi ssion through Van Tassel. When we examine the NASA video from the UFOs captured on STS-75, we can see that the blobs of light appear to be “spinning,” when the camera is pulled back. But when the camera zooms in, we can see that they ar e not spinning, rather, the UFOs are being pulsed with “spiraling waves of radiation” giving the illusion of spinning, precisely as Ashtar is telling Van Tassel. We continue on page 91 with Ashtar: “The upper or positive polarity of a ventla (ship) radiates em anations outwardly from the center. Due to the collection a nd concentration of light particles through a vortice funnel in the cent er unseen, these light eman ations radiating outward appear as grooves on one of your phonographic records.” I demonstrated through the use of my “Galaxy Clock” that the waves radiating out from the NASA UFO were radiating out from th e center “black hole” where the “Galaxy Clock” reveals a massive concentration or highe r frequency light waves. This is the point where either light speed was broken in the spiraling waves or that the waves were too high in frequency for the human eye or camer a to capture; thus “black hole” unseen. This is the same as Ashtar saying through Van Tassel that a “con centration of light particles (waves) through a vor tice funnel in the cen ter unseen (black hole). The“Galaxy Clock” demonstrates why light waves become more concentrated as light waves oscillate into smaller and smaller orbits. Further, Asht ar is precise enough to say that “these light emanations radiating outward appear as grooves on one of your photographic records,” precisely as Sereda had demonstrated by us ing his “Galaxy Clock” to show how the waves were radiating from th e NASA UFO on STS-75. The work is precise and even in the final statement of Ashtar: “The lower or negative polarity operates in a reverse manner. This light substance emanation is contained within a field of zero circumference, which is void, giving the impression of an edge.” I proposed in my theory by observing the waves on the NASA UFO to be a combined “time forward” wave with a “time reversed” wave (particle-anti-particle wave simulation). This is the same as Ashtar sa ying that “The lower negative polarity operates in a reverse manner.” The last statement by As htar in this sentence is very advanced in that it describes a field of such high fre quency, Ashtar’s “field of zero circumference” 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"(smaller than a sub-planck length) when measur ed in the “Galaxy Clock” this field would be of such a high frequency that it would be too fast of a wave for any camera to capture, thus it would give what Ashtar calls “giving the impression of an edge” to the infinitely small (ultra-high frequency) “black hole,” what Ashtar calls “a field of zero circumference which is void” (black). An electromagnetic field of zero circumference would be smaller than a “sub Planck lengt h” and would produce the highest frequency imaginable at this time. For Ashtar to be so precise that he would say “giving the impression of an edge” shows us that he know s the edge between the “light craft” itself and the “black hole” is an illusion, thus just an “impression.” Ashtar concludes that: “Your spectroscopic camera will reveal us only as light in the spectrum, plus Elements in your atmosphere.” Is Ashtar a fictitious character? I don’t know, but this in formation is highly coincidental to my own research over 40 years later. Many dimensions of light are invisible, of cour se.

Has the photon reduced the effects of Gravity-mass to near zero? How did it do it? What is the mass of a Photon? Why/how is light bent by gravity? If it is bent by gravity, it must have mass, once again, the clues are tr ying to tell us. It is not the mass-less quality of a photon that allows it to move at the speed of lig ht and beyond. It is another quality, a quality that all mass can possess. Abstract The point in this section is to try and study if the reason a photon can attain the speed of light is due to its “mass-less” property or its actual wave state . Einstein’s law surmises that mass cannot attain the speed of light re tains that only a mass-less particle can: the photon. But what if the reason photons can at tain light speed ha s nothing to do with whether or not they have mass? The photo-electric effect explai n by Einstein is a slightly heavy debate among scholars. How do mass-less photons knock an electron out of a conductor (Einstein’s photo- electric effect) when we see them as billiard balls on a table? It seems impossible that if the photon has no mass, that it can do this. Today, physicists claim that the photon’s elec tromagnetic force is exchanged by forcing the electron out of orbit in the conductor. But if mass has no overall electromagnetic charge on it, then how cold the photon’s EM force effect the zero EM force of the 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"electron, unless it held an electromagnetic ch arge? The electron is the lowest mass particle so it makes it the best candidate to compare its similarities to the photon’s. Mass then must have an electromagnetic char ge. If it does, Gravity could be explained by merging electromagnetism and gravity into one theory. Looking closely at the way gravity’s effect is a “differential” between th e centrifugal and centripetal forces of the earth’s spin and gravity’s pull, should we be looking for what I predicted as the “differential” force left over between the electron-anti-electron pairs and proton-anti- proton pairs? Differential forces may be the clue to understanding gravity. But most importantly, to understand the mass- gravity effect properly, we can hope to understand how to engineer anti -gravity , the desired goal of modern spaceflight. Anti- gravity also has many other useful applica tions, including construction of large stone masonry buildings. To understand that photons wave-particle pair s spin in duality against one another canceling out the overall obser vable electromagnetic energy (which I observe to be at near zero charge but not absolute zero), and the photon spins positive with no dual anti- photon holding it back, we can see the basic difference. CHAPTER IV – HOW TO REDUCE THE MASS-GRAVITY EFFECT OF AN AERO- SPACECRAFT TOWARDS ZERO A Zero-mass-gravity spacecraft can now attain the speed of light and beyond with near zero energy. The initial energy is applied to cause the reducing mass-gravity effect; thus energy is not wasted in trying to fight inertia l forces that make it too energy expensive to reach light speed and beyond. In this approach, it does take fuel to produce energy, but the energy is used in a different way. Goal Number 1 would be to calculate the differential between the proton-anti-proton pairs of a single atom, and then the same for the pairs of the electron. Once we know the differential dimensions of these wave pairs: 1. Wave-Particle Spin Velocity 2. Wave-Particle Amplitude 3. Wave-Particle Frequency 4. Wave-Particle Differentials 5. Wave-Particle Propagation Goal Number 2: We can build a wave gene rator that can duplicate all of these same dimensions of a wave-particle in a single atom. The idea is to build a wave generator that can duplicate the wave of mass (dual pairs), and be in “Phase Synchronicity” with it. 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Once our wave generator is capable of pulsing waves in “phase synchronicity” with that of the single atom, then we can start to manipulate the wave properties. If we want to produce a “Uni-pole” mass structure, all we have to do is flip the wave generation on the anti-particle pairs over so they spin positive. This s hould cause all of the waves in mass to spin positive creating the uni-pole eff ect. This alone could cause mass to be capable of moving at th e speed of light. Evidence of these kinds of waves in photo below: Notice the pairs of plasmatic balls inside the wave formations of this UFO. One is a slightly smaller diameter than the other in bot h cases. This means that one is slightly higher in frequency (the smaller diameter x pi) than the other. A differential can be calculated between them. These waves are doi ng exactly what I would expect them to do resembling how an atom in mass bound in duals pa irs would: travel in pairs that spin in opposite directions. But when we flip the an ti-particle pairs over to spin positive, they are still on a different diameter and this causes the distance between the pairs to be evident. Goal Number 3: is far more exciting becau se I think if we can know the exact wave dimensions of the “differentia l” (theoretical graviton), betw een the dual pairs, we could build a wave generator that is in phase synchr onicity with the gravit on. If we change the frequency of the graviton, I believe this is where we can best manipulate the effects of gravity and cause anti-gravity and mass-gr avity reductions on a significant scale. By speeding up the frequency of gravity, we can reduce the mass-gravity effect. By slowing it down, we can increase it. For a ny aircraft to have this ability would be phenomenal. The implications would be staggering. If we can reduce the mass-gravity effect down to zero, we can go light speed on zero energy in the form of propulsion. The mass-propellant problem with long range spaceflight using propellant mass would be solved. Tiny amounts of energy would be 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"needed for maintaining light speed, and ener gy would only be used when the ships and astronauts wanted to increas e their mass-gravity effect. CHAPTER V – EVIDENCE OF WAVE TRANSFORMATION OF MASS (REDUCING MASS GRAVITY EFFECT IN UFO CROP CIRCLE CASES In this Chapter, we will examine precise wave patterns revealed in numerous UFO cases to identify a language of wave-transforma tion of mass to cause the reduction of mass- gravity effects. If we know the language of reading wave-particle pairs in quantum physics, and how to reduce the mass-gravity effect by altering th e frequency of mass, and or the graviton, when we examine crop circle wave patterns, we can see the same message once again.  These two photos are from England’s 2004 Crop Circle Season The photo on the left can be seen as a hydroge n atom, with the proton in the center and the electron floating around the outside. Ther e are concentric rings or spirals weaving from the outer rim to the center in the larger circle and the central one. Deep inside the circles, the spirals appear to overlay in pair s (clockwise and anti-cl ockwise) This can be understood to emulate the wave-particle pairs of a proton or electr on (and anti-particles) in a transitory orbit, moving from a lower fr equency in the outer rim of the circle to a higher one as we move towards the center. The photo on the right shows what is evid ent in many authentic Crop Circles: a sophisticated weave of grass that spirals toward s the center. 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"   This third photo shows the smaller circle re sembling the electron in the hydrogen atom. Notice that it too has a progressive spir al orbit moving towards the center. Abstract Idea If these circle designs are the imprint left behind of the wave patte rns that created them, what are they telling us about the structure and state of the waves that created them? They are in a wave-progressive mode from lower to higher frequency orbits. Ordinary mass is not in a wave progressive state unless it is being transforme d. The diameters of wave-particles stay relatively stable in most atoms. If crop circle waves are trav eling in clock-wise and anti- clockwise, perhaps they are trying to tell us something: that our wave generators only need to mimic the path of particle-anti-particle pairs and the sought after “differential” between the pairs will manifest as a by-product. This is an important fact when we consider experimentation. As Niels Bohr show us, in his hydrogen atom model, when an electron jumps into a very slightly closer orbit around the atom, it radi ates off a photon, giving off its energy; thus reducing it’s mass, as energy and mass have an equivalency with Einstein theory.  While crop circles yield many desi gns, the central wave formati ons in each circle, or even semi-circle reveals the same progressive spiral wave formations that are evident in many authentic UFO cases. 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"As I have pointed out, it is all about wave tr ansformation of mass. The waves appear very clearly in any good UFO footage. This NASA STS-75 series of photos shows the exact same wave formations evident in Crop Circles.  But if Crop Circles are telling us a more precise language of wave transformation, perhaps we should consider looking further into them and comparing authentic crop circle formations with quantum physics models. I do not believe a full study has been done here. CHAPTER VI – SPACE PROPULSI ON FOR LIGHT SPEED AND BEYOND In this Chapter we will compare David Sere da’s theory on breaking light speed published in (copyright 2000) Evidence, the Case for NASA UFOs, and Joao Magueijo’s “Faster than the Speed of Light” (copyright 2003). In “Evidence, the Case for NASA UFOs,” I proposed a new theory on how mass-less photons could break the speed of light, and fu rther how a spacecraft that reduces it’s mass-gravity effect could do the same. 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The way I did this is by showing the progres sion of quantum gravity waves that go into smaller and smaller (higher frequency) or bits, which causes mass-gravity to keep on reducing. Because we can go into the micro-universe, and wave can get smaller and smaller in wave-length, the frequency of wa ve-particles can go towards an infinitely higher frequency, thus the mass gravity-effect of that wave-particle pair can reduce towards an infinite zero point. Even photons can get as if “lighter” and this ultimately causes them to break the speed of light. These photons would be undetectable to relativity because of their velocity being beyond relativity’s grasp (the speed of light). As I showed in the model used previously,    Spacecraft as wave-form moving through Space as Waveform Both are Pulsed & Timed If we assume the space craft is a photon, as its waves pass through the intervals of the wave form that space itself is, then this phot on becomes invisible to relativity. But the photons that bounce off of the peaks of the wave formation of the background of space, remain visible, even though they are of a very high frequency. The higher frequency photons that pass through the intervals of the background of space waveform, do not encounter as much inertia, and thus they accelerate faster than the speed of light. Dr. Raymond Chiao’s Photons Break Light Speed by Micro-tunneling We will also explain how and why Dr. Raym ond Chiao’s revolution in causing photons to break the speed of light occurred (1989) in the Galaxy Clock Model. Today, using similar methods scientists claim to be at 300 times the speed of light. But it seemed they didn’t understand “why” it was happening. Of most interest to us here in Quantonics, is the work of Raymond Chiao at UC Berkeley . He regularly performs table top experiments with an optical rig that races correlated 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"photons. One of the photons has to go through a barrier. The barrier is opaque to this photon’s energy/frequency. So if it gets through the barrier, it had to perform a quantum tunneling feat. Chiao shows, and others have verified in independent experiments, that the photon tunnels through the barrier at 1.7 times the speed of light! He says, “It’s surprising, and not everyone likes it, but it’s true.” Freedman te lls us that theoretically the experiment applies to matter as well as light. Some of the other disclosures in this article are profound. Get a copy and read this!! I believe the “quantum tunneling” of the photon caused its frequency to increase and its mass-gravity effect to decrease, and thus ove rcomes the inertia of the background forces of the universe, and accelerate beyond light speed. It is really consistent with the way I explained this in the discovery of using the “galaxy clock” to measure wave-particle pairs in all 4 dimensions. Even Joao Magueijo (Ph.D. Cambridge), in his book Faster than the Speed of Light (Copyright 2003), goes on an immense journey to break the speed of light and does it exactly as I had presented in “Evidence, the case for NASA UFOs”: quantum tunneling gravity waves, or even quantum tunneling EM waves. That was his final outcome. He didn’t even mention Raymond Chaio’s work at Berkeley, CA starting in 1989. But my work was copyright in 2000, and first printed in 2001, 2 years before his. Were we onto the same truth? Soon, I had discove red an even more astounding way to break the speed of light on lower frequenc y waves, and it was even better. A new way to break light sp eed on low frequency waves Also, a new theory on how to break the speed of light in the very low-frequency wave dimensions. This new work will explain pa rallel dimensions that are invisible to relativity that cross one another towards infin ity at many times faster than the speed of light. This discovery came to me in the fall of 2003, in Taos New Mexico. Abstract While light waves are now understood to be tu nneling by nature, rather than just bobbing up and down on an imaginary, infinite 2 dime nsional space (absurd), we know that the spin velocity is faster than the fo rward propagation of light speed/c. 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"  It is so startling simple, if we turn away 90 degrees away from the forward propagation of a light wave , seen in the above diagram moving right to left, we can see a velocity that is faster than the speed of light , but the diameter is too sma ll to be significant to conquer any reasonable space distance. It was staring Joao Magueijo right in the face. He even briefly mentioned it in his book, “Faster than the Speed of Light,” and then just skipped by it, because of the fact that the diameter (wavelength) is too small. Bu t what happens, as we can manipulate radio waves, if we alter the frequency of the wave, it’s diameter gets larger. In fact, we can stretch that diameter across any distance in curved space we want, and we can travel 90 degrees away from the forward propagation of a light wave, at somewhere around 3.14 x c, but this is not an exact figure.   These dimensions of a light wave would be undetectable by relativity, and never appear visible. Also, not matter how much we change the frequency of a light wave, its forward propagation would always be c because of its ability to adjust the angle of the wave. But how could I go faster than this one step leap? I can go much fa ster if I reveal a deeply hidden clue in quantum physics. 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"  If we look closely, we can see in this atomic collision photo taken in a streamer chamber, above center right, moving right to left, an anti -proton is accelerated to near the speed of light. While at first glance, it seems to be moving straight in, but looking closer, we can see it too is spiraling as it propagates along its curved ve locity through space time.  Examining the area closer, we can see that if we magnify the longer curves, or even shorter curves that wave-parti cles leave in bubble and streamer chambers, that they too are spiraling as they forward propagate in thei r wave forms. It is a little fuzzy, but the spiral is there and the wave peaks are clear ly visible. What does this mean? 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"  This diagram shows what we are really dealing with in examining light waves, and the nature of all wave-particle pair s: that there are infinite vorte xes upon infinite vortexes. In this diagram, if the forward (right to left) propagation of a light wave is 186,282 mps, then how fast is the 90 degrees away from th e forward propagation: at least 3.14 x c. But then, going further, how fast is the spiral spin velocity in the particle wave examined more closely? It has to be another exponential number greater than the last calculation at 3.14 x c. With this we can go infinitely sm aller, finding even fast er and faster spin velocities on wave-particle pairs.  And the, as this diagram shows, we can sl ow the frequency of any wave down, by first creating a wave that is in phase with it, and the diameter of that wave can be stretched across infinite distances of the universe. If the theory is correct, thes e longer wavelengths with infinite spin velocities should already exist without having to manipulate the waves. But a ll of this would be happening right under our noses, completely invisible to relativity. 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"If mass or spacecraft could attune to these wave s, it could travel at velocities, skipping dimensions like ours, with absolute ea se far beyond the speed of light. At this point, for a civilization to master wave manipulation and attuning mass to these very high frequency and high spin velocity dime nsions, they would ultimately be able to conquer any distance in reasona ble amounts of time. From our perspective, they could jump from one place too another and back before we could count to “one.” I was astounded to read an article posted on CNN that confirms my prediction: that mass in a high frequency state, at the core of a black hole can travel faster than the speed of light. http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/ space/10/03/black.holes/index.html Differentials – The missing part of the ultimate Equation As I proposed and demonstrated that the missi ng “Graviton” is likely to be a differential between particle and anti-particle pairs, and that Gravity is the differential between centrifugal and centripetal for ces on earth, differentials reveal themselves to be an overlooked part of the equation of the universal model in search for the ultimate truth. If we look at how wave particle pairs reveal themselves to have vortexes within vortexes, we can see the primary and secondary wave form ations reveal that the differential is the cause of the secondary and third, etc. dimensions of waves. 2-Level Wave Model shows Micro-Coil-Wave & Secondary Wave Forms In order to cause a singular wave structure to bend into a secondary wave formation, the wave (dual-pair) has to have a differential (one part of the duality of the wave is slightly higher in frequency than the ot her) to cause the secondary wa ve to be born. Otherwise, the singular micro-spiral primary wave would not bend at all into a secondary wave 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"formation. It would just pr opagate along in both a spiral and forward propagation. But it doesn’t.

Because each dimension has different aspects with regards to how it relates to relativity as we know it. DNA double helix also revea ls the differential: If we look at the DNA spiral as a double helix, and separate out each single he lix, and if we place them on a Galaxy Clock, we will find that one single helix, when compared to its pair, will be slightly smaller in diameter (wavelength) than its pair helix (the oretical prediction). Between them will be a differential. This causes one of the pairs to oscillate slighter higher in frequency than 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"its pair and this gives birth to a bendi ng producing a secondary spiraling wave, and a third and so forth is how waves within waves start to emerge. If waves were not in pairs and there was no differential, waves woul d propagate straight up in perfect cylindrical columns with no s econdary bending. The secondary bending is indeed caused because of the fact that the pa irs are not each at the exact same frequency. If we look once again closely at this photo from the subatomic collision referred to earlier, we can see when we examine a long part icle wave, that it is also spiraling in a sub-level spiral. It is the differential that gives birth to the multiple layers of spirals within spirals. But as we also demonstrated, it is velocity of spin in the quantum world that eventually gets so fast, it become invisible to rela tivity and light. These ultra-high frequency particles are the doorway to understanding i nvisible dimensions. Light speed thus appears far too slow, and unrel iable to hang a theory of Relativity on, when it cannot even detect invisible dimensions. CHAPTER VII – SINGULAIRTY – THE REVELATION 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"  Andromeda Galaxy If we consider how long it takes light to travel through the spa ce medium, it becomes almost useless to detect any events in the Ga lactic terms over such great distances in real time. We cannot even observe anything in real time in the nearest galaxy to ours, the Andromeda galaxy when it is 2.2 million light years from earth. We only see events as they happened 2.2 million years ago. Why then does light travel so slowly? Is there a way to make observations instantly over any di stance and thus see events in real time in inter-galactic terms? If we could find this, we would know how to base true relativity in absolute real time without distortion, and without delay. We would see the Universe as it is happening right now. Why light travels so slow The reason light travels so slowly (186,282 m iles per second) and not at instantaneous velocities over any intergalactic distance or ev en short distance, is because it encounters resistance (inertia) as it tries to propagate in any direction. What causes inertia is a body of wave-particle pairs. Wave particle pairs are always in duality, and always eventually meet up with opposing wave particle pairs. Opposition causes resistance (inertia) to force or slow down the movement of any wave particle pair in the Galaxy, including light (which is a single wave particle). When we look at this, we can almost se the metaphors in our own lives, that when we have the desire to move in any direction, something will oppose us. That resistance will always be met, physically, politically, spiritua lly, or emotionally. Even if we have a thought, opposing thoughts manifest in our minds and the difference between opposing thoughts and our thought of action will be a weak left over force that moves along in some kind of a direction. What causes Inertia Now all atoms (matter) are founded in dual pairs: Proton-anti-p roton, electron-anti- electron, neutron-anti -neutron, quarks and anti-quarks, right down to the waves 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"themselves. Everything is duality. Inertia is caused when any wave positive or negative moves forward and is met with resistance from its opposite or opposing force. This always happens in a dual natured universe. Light, the one particle we know of that has no anti-particle, spins posi tive and is therefore (single) on its own. It is an amazing thing to ponder. Perhaps this is why light can travel so fast, but why not instantaneously over any distance? What slows light down so greatly? Inertia. Light m oves through a wave, a very long standing wave that is known as the background of space, the Cosmological C onstant. This is the apparent emptiness of space. If space had no pressure or for ce and was a true vacuum, then light would propagate through it with no resi stance and it would be instanta neous. It does not, so this tells us there is pressure or inertia encountered, proving that the Cosmological Constant is a wave, a very long wave with a period greater than the period that a galactic wave oscillates (our Milky Way Galaxy oscill ates once every 250 million years). Long standing waves are hard to measure because in a single lifetime, we will never see one happen. If the cosmological constant is also a long standing wave, it may have an oscillation factor of once ever y 12 billion years or greater. No one knows it the universe is just one long standing wave because we cannot measure its period. But the law of inertia tells us it must be a wave because that is what opposes light and puts pressure on it to slow it down. So even though light is singl e, it is opposed by an altern ate opposing force as it moves through the Cosmological Constant’s Negative pressure (positive energy = duality). Duality always slows things down. The speed of light is just that, a speed. It is not instant, especially in galactic terms. Singularity Jesus said, “If thine eye become single, thy w hole body shall be filled with light.” It is amazing to me that what Jesus spoke about 200 0 years ago rings true to physics today. When Adam and Eve partook of the fatal know ledge of “Good and Evil” they partook of duality, (conflict), which is what happened to all matter in the material universe. It became encoded with duality. This could not be a coincidence that we would find this to be true. Light is the only particle we know of th at is “Single,” not in a dual state. It spins positive (as positive energy) and has no anti-particle inside of it. But light alone encounters its opposite as it propagates through it, the background of space, the Cosmological Constant Negative Pressu re, Positive Energy duality. But true Singularity would be a higher trut h than light as we know it in regards to Relativity. Jesus said in the Gospel of Th omas, that “I am he who exists from the Undivided....” The Undivided is True Singularity, beyond the duality of the Universe as we know it. To find true Singularity would be the Holy Grail in Physics, if anyone could find it. It would practically prove what Jesus was talki ng about, and scientifi cally prove that God 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"exists. I had been looking for true singular ity, a form beyond all duality in Physics ever since I finished breaking the speed of light by many times, and still finding myself frustrated with even how slow that is in gala ctic terms. No absolute relativity could hinge and rely on a force so slow as the speed of light. It was also too slow for me in terms of Advanced Aerospace Propulsion. At the speed of light, I would have to travel in a space ship for 2.2 million years to get to Andromeda ( our nearest Galaxy). That is ridiculously slow. UFS have to be far more advanced th an even the speed of light. Singularity would be the only true force that is beyond space a nd time because it would be instantaneous over any distance, making it the only true force to base Relativity on. That is why I was so passionate about finding it. But why Si ngularity? Why would it be instant? Paul Dirac Paul Dirac (shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 with Erwin Schrodinger) wrote an infamous paper on Singularity, further written by Donald Hotson called, “Dirac’s Equation and the Sea of Negative Energy (Parts I and II).” When I read this I was astounded. But what really astounded me was this paper was rejected by the mainstream physics community. When I heard that it was re jected, I just had to read it. Dirac won the Nobel Prize. Jesus said, “The stone whic h the builders rejected, this became the chief cornerstone.” (Luke 20:17). Now I had to r ead it. If mainstream physics could answer my questions, I would go to them, but they couldn’t so I will go to the stone that was rejected. Donald Hotson paper on, “Dirac’s Equation a nd the Sea of Negative Energy (Parts I and II),” may just be the most single important paper ever written in the discovery of Physics of our time. That is how I feel about it af ter I read it. The onl y thing I think he is missing is the “Differential” between wave part icle pairs that I have discovered. That adds an element that would explain the unthinkable: there is no Time. In a Secret Gosepl of John, John said: - \"M aster, is there any material universe?\" Jesus answered: -\"No.\" John asked: - \"I s there matter?\" Jesu s answered: - \"No.\" My first thought was that if we could cause light to exit the material universe, it could move instantaneously anywhere , because it would encounter no resistance. No resistance means that nothing slows it down, and its veloc ity would be infinite and instantaneous and would be beyond time. But Dirac’s paper recorded the birth of all matter (electron-po sitron dual pairs) from high frequency light waves (gammas): In defense of Heisenberg, the expe rimental evidence had indeed begun to Look as if “creation” and “annihila tion” were actually happening. In Cloud chambers studies of cosmic ra ys, high energy gamma rays (photons) Suddenly gave birth to electron pos itron pairs (epos), which separated at high velocity. The positron then would approach a nother electron, and The two would disappear, being replaced by high energy (0.511 MeV) 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" Photons. What Dirac found out was that the dual base pairs of matter (electron-positron pairs) were being created and annihilated as if from now here. They came from apparent emptiness, and went back into it without a trace. This is starting to sound like Buddhist prin ciples: that all phenomena come from emptiness, and return back into emptiness; a nd are thus impermanent. The emptiness, is the goal in Buddhism, to not identify with im permanent phenomena and to follow, in the mind, the path that all impermanent phenomen a make, because if we find it in our mind, we find Enlightenment; the place of the One. Dirac was intent on finding just where all dual pairs were created from and then annihilated back into. This place would seem to supply the universe with an infinite amount of energy. This place, Dirac found, wa s called a “Sea of Negative Energy” where every pair of opposites are not pairs of opposites because they are all singular charged particles that are all negative (counterclockw ise spin). The Sea of Negative Energy proposes an entire substratum to the universe that is Single (and has no opposing force in it) and to enter it or to be born in it, everyt hing is “Single,” and there is no duality in it and to annihilate or return into the Sea of Singularity, one cannot remain a duality. If we say that this Sea of Negative (Singular ity) exists as a substratum to the universe, and anything (consciousness, spaceship or fo rce) could enter it and become single also, it could travel instantaneously through any dist ance in space and thus conquer the whole universe in zero time. The reason being that in a Sea of Singular ity, there is no opposing force to cause inertia to slow anything down. It is all one, and thus perfectly uniform. There is no resistance in Singularity. This presents itself as the only force that is truly beyond space and time. If we consider the spiritual models of the Buddha and Chri st I presented, and that they knew about Singularity, and how duality was born as a lower nature out of it (the fall from divinity in the Garden of Eden by partaking of duality “ good and evil”), this then proves that Jesus was from Singularity, the highest goal in physics. This is scientific proof that God exists. When Dirac realized that travel through the Sea of Negative Energy wa s instant, and that in fact there was no travel or time because ev erything there is instant, he could solve the largest problem in Astrophysics, that the Bi g Bang theory could not answer: why is the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Bac kground Radiation that permeates the whole universe as far as the Hubble Space telesc ope can see, even and not gradient? Most cosmologists today believe that the universe we inhabit exploded into being some 15 billion years ago in a titanic fi reball called the big bang. The modern big bang theory does not state that a concentrated lump of matter located at a particular point in space suddenly exploded, sending fragments rushing away at high speed, but that space itself came into being at th e moment of the big bang. The birth of the universe is said to have happened in th e following manner [1]. In the beginning, a 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"tiny bubble of spacetime, a b illion-trillion-trillionth of a centimetre across (10-33 cm), popped spontaneously into existence out of nothing as the result of a random quantum fluctuation. It was seized by an intense anti-gravitational force which caused it to expand with explosive rapidit y. In scarcely more than a billion-trillion- trillionth of a second the universe swelled to about 10 cm, the size of a grapefruit. The anti-gravitational force then disappeared, and the inflationary phase of accelerating expansion came to an abrupt ha lt amid a burst of heat. The heat energy and gravitational energy of expanding space then produced matter and, as the universe cooled, more and more structure began to 'freeze out' -- first nuclei, then atoms, and finally galaxies, stars, and planets. Had there been a Big Bang, actually, its core explosion temperature would be infinitely hot and as the universe cooled, over time, the background temperature of the universe would be a gradient curve. In reality, it is not a gradient, but a uniform temperature. In order for it to be uniform, the Big Bang could not have happened the way Einstein thought with regards to Relativity. But Dirac’s Sea of Negative Energy shows th at when creation comes out of a uniform Sea of Singularity that is beyond all velocitie s of light, and is truly instant over any distance, thus as creation happens and matter is born into space, its friction (temperature) upon entry would be uniform; just as the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation appears, uniform in temperature. Now, if I can build a spaceshi p and transform its wave state into singularity and enter the Sea of Singularity, I could travel to the Andr omeda galaxy (2.2 million light years away) in an instant. Singularity represents the only true force to base Relativity on to observe and communicate any distance, observe any event over any distance, in absolute real time. Light is simply just to slow.
