It is devoted exclusively to the research findings of Dr. Paulo Correa and Mrs. Alexandra Correa of Conc ord, Ontario, Canada and seeks to explain the fundamental physics underlying their re markable experimental discovery. The Correa technology pioneers one of the four routes now opening up and promising to give us access to a plentiful and a bundant source of what is coming to be termed `free energy'. These all can contribute in their various ways to an energy future free from pollution, but all, at this time, trespass on forbidden territory, as judge d by orthodox physicists and so are not attracti ng mainstream scientific interest. This leaves the field open fo r exploration and exploitation by the few who do have the needed technical competence, the insp iration and an independence of spirit. The four avenues can be classified as (1) cold fu sion, (2) ferromagnetism (3) vacuum spin and (4) electrodynamics. Each involves a myst erious input source of excess energy and each is destined to impact the world of tec hnology in the near future. It is debatable at this time whether events will c onfirm true nuclear 'cold fusi on' as the source of heat in the well publicized pioneer work of Fleischmann and Pons. It may in fact be another manifestation of the 'vacuum spin' phenomenon, by creating in an aque ous electrolyte, or even in the cathode itself, conditions somewhat analogous to those prevailing in the Correa apparatus. Indeed, there seems to be no doubt that the Correa technol ogy itself bridges two of the above 'excess energy' categories, electrodynamics and vacuum spin. The Correa me thod is probably the most advanced of these emerging new energy technologies, be ing fully reproducible, well rese arched with its test findings well documented in and protected by granted U.S. pa tents. It already allows us to tap energy from space itself, or rather the vacuum field activity that fills space, and in contra st with the alternative methods it offers what may prove to be a mobile light-weight power source compared with the heavy apparatus needed where magnets and rotating mach inery are involved. Unlike 'cold fusion' which generates low grade heat output, the Correa technol ogy generates electricity at power voltage levels. The physics involved in understanding the source of en ergy in the Correa discharge tube is as basic as that required to understand the energy source which sets up the force of gravity. Both are seated in an electrodynamic action involving, in the main, heavy ions and, i ndeed, the electrodynamics of the interactions between heavy ions ar e not well understood by scientists. This is why they have failed to solve the mysteries of gravitation and the problem of field unification a nd why they have missed seeing the way forward to the ne w energy technology which we are about to discuss in this Report. Below we will come to describe the operating pr inciples of the Correa i nvention and the action by which energy is extracted from the aether. The read er who is impatient and curious to learn some details about the technology may wish to jump ah ead to read the secti on between pp. 6 and 8 and then from p. 17 before coming back to read what immediately follows. The sceptical scientist who does not expect to believe what is evidently bei ng claimed will be served best by following the discourse as it now develops. Preliminary Remarks Having just stated that \"the el ectrodynamics of the interactions between heavy ions are not well understood by scientists\" I see it as important to ju stify this statement before I venture to criticize other as p ects of basic p h y sical theor y relevant to the new ener gy field.

The title of the pa tent application was 'I on accelerators and energy transfer processes'. Textbook doctrine on the s ubject has not progressed since that time. \"Electrical engineering has deve loped using the simplest formul a (for electrodynamic interaction between electric charges in motion) and few today would concede that there is any question about the universal validity of this fo rmula, the so-called Lorentz formula. More informed teachers of electrical engineering have kept the problem in mind and express caution. Professor E. B. Moullin, who was President of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and Professor of Electrical Engineering at Cambridge University at a time when th e applicant was engaged on Ph.D. research in electromagnetism (1950-1953), wrote in the 1955 edi tion of his 'Principles of Electromagnetism': 'It is useless to speculate about the effects of elec tricity moving in a particul ar piece of circuit until we have discovered further laws of electromagnetism' This appears at page 26 of this Ox ford University Press publication.\" \"In a book by A. Von Engel entitled 'Ionized Gases', 1965 Edition also by Oxford University Press, there is the statement at page 285: 'There is no final answer to the question of whet her the primary electrons find in the plasma an artifice which without extracting too much energy is able to transform the more or less uniform electron energy into an energy distribution which is needed to satisfy ion production in the gas. In fact it has been suggested, as a result of certain probe measurements, that there is a strong positive space charge accumulated in front of the cathode, so intense that the space potential is considerably higher than the discharge voltage and at leas t higher than the lowest excitation potential . How this space charge develops and how electrons have random energies sufficient to overcome the retardation in the negative field between the space charge and the anode is still an open question.' Earlier on page 273 he wrote: 'One of the most puzzling problems of the arc discha rge is the functioning of the cathode of the cold arc. Cathodes of Cu, Ag, liquid Hg, and many other meta ls are examples of this type. It can be stated from the very outset that no final solu tion of this problem has yet been found .' Berneryd et al (Direct Current, vol. 6, 1961, pp. 81-85) studied instabilities of discharges and found p ositive ions to have energies very much highe r than suggested by theory. Benford et al (New Scientist, vol. 56, 1972, pp. 514-516), writing about electron beams in relation to fusion, declared that a 1.3 MeV electron system accelerated gas ions to energies as high as 20 MeV. They said that the origin of the fields wa s a subject of speculation . Stock (Journal of Physics D, vol. 6, 1973, p. 988) found that ionization current calculated from electron energies were up to one thousand times smaller than those observed .\" N ow, in quoting the above I have added the underlining to the marked passages to emphasize my p oint that the scientific `experts' in the field do not understand the reason for these energy anomalies p roduced by electrical discharges through ionized gas. The scenar io giving these problems is one where the discharge involves a predominant presence of heavy ions rather than the mere arc discharge of electrons freed as by thermionic emission. It applies to cu rrent in what are termed 'cold cathode' discharge tubes. The passages quoted above should be kept in mind when reading about the technological breakthrough disclosed by the Correa inventions. The phenomenon involved has been turned to account by generating electrical power output far in excess of the input power used and so it is no lon g er a q uestion of scientists declarin g , as the y do re g ularl y , that the y understand so much about the Pa g e 3 of 37 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es8/Re p 8.htm"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"laws of thermodynamics that they can deny this possibility without even considering the evidence. They do not understand their own expe rimental findings of clear record in this particular technical field and so are in no position to say that excess power generation is impossi ble by virtue of a 'law' p rescribed by past 'authority' in ignorance of the experimental facts just quoted. We have here to confront the r eality of this s ituation, namely that energy from a mystery source can b e harnessed technologically, and this Report aims to explain this as we ll as pointing to the source of that energy and showing where accepted phys ics stands in need of correction. To appreciate in full measure of what this Report is about it is recommended that the reader should p rocure copies of the three U.S. Patents grante d to Dr. Paulo N. Correa and Mrs. Alexandra N. Correa: U.S. Patent No. 5,416,391 (issued Ma y 16, 1995), U.S. Patent No. 5,449,989 (issued September 12, 1995) and U.S. Pate nt No. 5,502,354 (issued March 26, 1996). The disclosure in the specifications contains experime ntal facts presented in a form which amounts to an academic dissertation or degree thesis and, as I see it, the disclosure in these patents cannot now be ignored owing to their clear showing that we already ha ve access to the hidden energy source which one can p resume powered the crea tion of the universe. I can also interject here a note adde d since the main body of this text wa s written to advise that a full description of the Correa project together with a copy of the specification of U.S. Patent 5,416,391 has been published in the Vol. 2, No. 7, 1996 issu e of Infinitie Energy (I SSN 1081-6372), Editor-in- Chief and Publisher Eugene F. Ma llove Sc.D. and that publication wa rrants the fullest attention. Still as part of these preliminary remarks I further draw a ttention to the fact that my paper: 'The Law of Electrodynamics', appeared 27 years ago in the Journal of the Franklin Institute, 287 , 171-183 (1969). It explained how one coul d justify, by simple dynamic analys is based on empirical data, the fact that in an electrical disc harge through heavy ions there is an axial electrodynamic force acting on the ions that is (M/m)i 2 , where M/m is the ratio of ion mass to electron mass and i is the current carried by the heavy ions. I stated that many authors had found anomalous ca thode reaction forces in discharge studies and quoted E. Kobel, Physical Revi ew, 36, p.1636 (1930) as measuring th at anomalous cathode reaction force and showing that it was proportional to the squa re of current and far greater than any value one could compute from a pinch pressure in the discharge filament. Later, in 1977, my paper: 'Electrodynamic Anomalie s in Arc Discharge Phenomena', appeared in IEEE Transactions of Plasma Science, PS - 5 , 159-163 (1977). Here I had in mind the subject of my p atent application as referenced above. See the quot ed text on its p. 161 and the last five lines on p. 163, where the action was deemed to accelerate ions into the cathode as a means for generating heat. I had by then become aware of the possibility that we could tap vacuum field energy and generate heat anomalously by harnessing th e electrodynamic forces set up in an axial discharge involving heavy ions. However, my circ umstances did not allow me to take the proposition forward experimentally. The invention, the su bject of that patent, was aimed at tapping the zero-point field energy to produce 'excess energy' heat by the el ectrodynamic ion discharge action which sustains a p ositive space charge adja cent the cathode. In contrast, as we shal l see below, the Correa invention is able to produce electrical power di rectly by discharging that posit ive charge in pulses drawn through a secondary output circuit. The energy source in both cas es is the same, as is the principle for setting up the positively ionized plasma a nd holding it transiently stable. By 1985 a new kind of discharge anomaly had been re ported as a result of passing very high current through water. I showed a simple derivation of my version of the law of electrodynamics and commented on this anomaly in my paper: 'A New Perspective on the Law of Electrodynamics', Physics Letters, 111A , 22-24 (1985). This referred to the incomprehensible enormous explosive effects found from p ulsed ion dischar g es in p ure water and p ointed a g ain to the reason advocated Pa g e 4 of 37 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es8/Re p 8.htm"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"earlier, namely that scaling factor of m/m. Separately in my paper: 'Anomalous Electrodynami c Explosions in Liquids', IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, PS - 14 , 282-285 (1986), I presented a more detailed analysis of the incredibly high speed at which ions are driven into an electr ode, in defiance of known physics. In the Correa invention to be described there is a slowing down of these fast ions by causing them to transfer energy into the build-up of electric charge in th e abnormal glow discharge in front of the cathode, which energy can be drawn off as output el ectrical power, rather than as heat. To complete this preliminary account I refer also to my paper: 'The Thunderball - An Electrostatic Phenomenon', presented at the 'E lectrostatics 1983' conf erence held at Oxford University, and documented in Inst. Phys. C onf. Series No. 66, at pp. 179-184. As can be seen from the data presented in the th ird Correa patent referenced above, the operation of the Correa discharge tubes at low pulse frequency indicates that energy in excess of 1,000 joules can be stored in the plasma of each discharge pulse. This implies an enormous capacitance and voltage gradients that should be far in excess of those actually prevailing. Indeed, for such energy to be contained as electric char ge energy in a plasma confined within the Correa tube one would expect voltage gradients expressed in bi llions of V/m, unless some comp ensating reaction suppresses that field. This energy of 1,000 J in a volume of plasma of the cubic cm. order is an energy density of some 10 9 J/m 3 , which is of the same order as that known to exist in thunderballs produced by lightning discharges. The Correa invention therefore, in a se nse, mimics the action of lightning discharges in compacting energy into plasma balls which we se e as the thunderball anom alies of atmospheric electricity. The subject paper, which will be reproduced later in this Report as Appendix II, explained how radial electric displacement, as opposed to the transverse di splacement we know from Clerk Maxwell's theory, can induce `vacuum spin' or `aet her rotation' which permits such energy densities to be stored in an electrically quasi-s table manner at low voltage gradients. The Correa technology, it will be suggested, does th erefore rely on `vacuum spin' for its storage function, whilst setting up the positive plasma in the discharge tube by electro-dynamic confinement in an axial sense, as opposed to the electromagneti c `pinch' sense that features in fusion reactor research. However, though it succeeds in sustai ning confinement for the pulse period, the Correa device it is not powered by a fusi on process. Indeed, since this aut hor presented the subject paper at the conference at Oxford University he has become aware of independent res earch in three countries on electromagnetic machines which overheat owi ng to the low voltages and very high current involved, but which nevertheless draw energy anomal ously from the `aether' by setting up radial electric fields in a conductive disc spinning in a magnetic field. The Correa technology taps this same `vacuum spin' source of ener gy and the subject paper published by the Institute of Physics in U.K. points to the aether phenomenon involved. It is of interest also to mention that geophysicists and cosmologists have not been able to explain the magnetism of the Earth or the Sun in terms of unipolar charge rotating wi th that body, even though a connection was recognized which gave basis to th e Schuster-Wilson hypothesis. This was not just because they discovered that the magnetic field reve rses periodically but because the charge needed would develop those same electric field gradients of billions of V/ m that are somehow avoided in the Correa tube. This really is an interesting subject of research, all connected wi th the evident fact that charge displacement in the aether ca ncels that electric field but does not cancel the magnetic field! I therefore see the Correa research as having importa nt implications for the interpretation of several p henomena in cosmology. See also Appendix I, where I explain why the alleged self-excited dynamo theor y for the g eoma g netic field is q uite untenable.

Copies are available from Sabberton Publications, P.O. Box 35, Southampt on SO16 7RB, England, th e publishing source of this Report. This was a lecture delivered by the au thor as an invited speaker addressing students in the Physics Department at that university. It d ealt with the subject of anomalous electrodynamic acceleration of ions in plasma di scharges and explained why this was relevant to the induction of 'vacuum spin' which was intimately linked with the energy and momentum aspects of creation of stars and planets, as well as thunderball and tornado phenomena. Th e basic physics of 'vacuum spin' are there presented in a concise way for easy assimilation by students. The lecture paper also explains how 'vacuum spin' can stabilize the ax ial discharge and pointed to some surprising experimental work by Vonnegut on that subject. Later in a note at the end of th is report text from the last page of that lecture paper is reproduced for the reader's interest. It is also noted that an important updated section of the theoretical an alysis in that paper has recently b een incorporated in my new book 'Aether Science Pape rs', now available from the publishers of this Report. It will be evident from this that the now-e merging technology for generating power from space energy is destined eventually to upset the physics world and particularly co smologists. Instead of exercising their criticism to block the breakthr ough developments on the new energy front, they need instead to look to their own problems, as now expose d, because they have invested so much time in futile theoretical pursuits th at now come under attack. The Correa Project Essentially the core element of the Correa appara tus is an electrical discharge tube containing a rarefied gas. It is a tube having a special cons truction but which can be manufactured in much the same way as a fluorescent lamp. It s objective, when used in a specia l circuit, is not the emission of light but rather the generation of electrical power in excess of the input power needed for its operation. This seemingly impossible feat is proved by providing a battery of el ectric d.c. storage cells large enough to deliver a high enough voltage to trigger the discharge which in turn feeds output to a separate battery of d.c. storage cells which store the electrical energy generated. Since the generation of electricity is the objective there can be no better way of proving that, over a period of time, the net energy output exceeds by far the net energy input. Measurements of instantaneous power and the energy transients can reassure an investigator that there is a power gain but sustained performance conditions are essential for a definitive proof. Indeed, this will be be tter understood when the p rinciple of operation is explained. The pulse of en ergy input is ahead of th e output pulse in time- p hasing, owing to the intervening opening of the gate , otherwise described as the radial electric field, which allows entry of energy from the quantum activity of the v acuum field. The battery tests, repeated during a succession of charge and discharg e cycles, using two banks of cells, one charging on output power as the other discharges input power, provide indisputable evidence of a substantial gain in power. This gives a verifiable accounting of an energy inflow that can be put to good use while enough energy is returned to sustain operati on of the system. Though a cumbersome part of the overall apparatus in comparison with the small and light-weight tube, wh ich is the heart of the system, such a battery of conventional electric stor age cells satisfies a research need, but ultimately, since power feedback should make the device self sustaining, one can foresee a compact product not requiring these cells and which operates to de liver electric power, as if from nowhere. N ow, our world of technology is not really ready to accept such a claim a nd no amount of technical comment here concerning the specific structure of the Correa apparatus can sway the minds of a p rofessionally qualified engineering and scientific community, well indoctrinated by their teaching and b y their ex p erience to re q uire conformit y with the well established laws of thermod y namics.

Firstly, does the Correa appara tus really deliver what is claimed? That is a question of fact which needs the testimony of thos e witnessing demonstrations and able to judge what they see. Secondly, given th at the Correa invention does deliver excess power, how are we to come to terms with the need to understand the true source of that excess energy? To be sure, the answer is not to be found in physics textbooks and such textbooks are not noted for disclosing unsolved mysteries. Yes, they do te ll us that there is still a myst ery concerning the force of gravity, which we all know should somehow find unification wi th the theory of electromagnetism. However, gravity is something everyone of us contends with every waking hour of our lives. It weighs upon us p hysically, if not mentally, but there are forces a nd actions seated in the energy background that are revealed only in a spurious way or come fleeti ngly from unusual experimental conditions. These are not recorded in our physics textbooks, because t hose who write such books write only about topics they understand and can expl ain by accepted theory. This, therefore, is why this Report is being writte n. We need to understand that source sufficiently to be able to do onward design work and develop the Correa invention. We need to understand it in order to reassure those who mana ge and invest in new energy t echnology, because there has to be scientific certainty underpinni ng any R & D venture that is not funded as a mere academic speculation. The latter is the pr ovince of the funding resource a ssigned to university and to government research instit utions and those responsible for such funding are very careful indeed in ensuring they avoid controversy by not investing in projects wh ich their peers may ridicule. The Correa project is now the tri gger for taking forward the theme of some earlier re search findings, notably those of Geoffrey Spence, a researcher in U.K. who has demonstrated an operable `over- unity-performing' discharge devi ce to sponsoring interests, but whose device was presumably impractical in requiring heavy magnets to guide the discharge in a kind of cy clotron spiral orbit. There is also the research of Professor Chernetski i in Russia and possibly even the work of Tesla to keep in mind, but it is the resear ch of Dr. Paulo Correa and Alexandr a Correa that has been disclosed in sufficient detail to warrant atte ntion at this time in view of the immediate pr ospect it offers for rapid technological development. Later in this Report such bac kground activity will be reviewed b ecause the several earlier findings lend support to the Correa project, but the immediately following sections of this Report will be devoted to presenti ng a scientific case concerning the true source of the excess energy generated by these plasma discharge devices. To conclude this introduction to the Correa proj ect, it is noted, by way of a summary, that the apparatus involves a cold-cathode el ectric discharge with current flow between anode and cathode p roducing an axially-directed electrodynamic compre ssion force which squeezes positive ions into a ball of plasma trapped against the cathode. The electron current from the cathode delivers the negative electrons at a rate whic h is overwhelmed by the ion discharge pulse and the powerful ball o f p ositively charged plasma can build up enormous ra dial electric field gradients which induce equally enormous cancelling electric field gradients owing to a spin re action set up in the vacuum medium. The vacuum reacts by propagating waves when res ponding to transverse electric fields around a radio antenna. However, whereas the latter promot e such wave propagation according to Maxwell's theory, the vacuum spin provides a contained quas i-stable field condition which draws energy from the phase-lock of the quantum spin states of th e enveloping aether field. The analogy we see in nature is the creation of the t hunderball which research findings sh ow to have electrical energy densities of the order of 10 9 J/m 3 stored in their plasma forms. Some of the pulses in the Correa experiments operated at low pulse frequencies are found to contain energy of one thousand joules or more. With a 2 cm electrode spacing defining a plas ma as having a volume of cubic cm. order, this gives 10 9 J/m 3 as an energy density, clearly of the sa me order as is repor ted from thunderball investigations. It has, incidentall y, been reported that a thunderball was once seen to enter a barrel of water and dissipate itself leaving the water at an elevated temperature. From the data collected its ener gy densit y was estimated.

The Correa data indicate an inverse relationship between the energy out put per pulse and the pulse fre quency, given a sustained input voltage and input current. Therefore, much of th e Correa research has invol ved examining different electrode configurations, gas filli ngs and pressures, as well as different electrode materials and operating conditions, all with the object of determini ng which give the best power gain. Such data is p resented in the Correa patents and the technical de scription which will be given later in this Report is directed not to the specific te chnology options, but rather to the disc losure of what is relevant to understanding what governs the access to the vacuum energy source. The Root of the Problem It is basic to the teaching of Newtonian mechanics that mome ntum is conserved when energy transfers between particles in motion. Yet Newton's laws were formulated before the electrodynamic action between charged bodies had been discovere d and before it was known that all matter is composed of fundamental particles which are elect rically charged. Scientists today declare that a substantial portion of the matter forming material bodi es on Earth is really attr ibutable to `neutrons', which supposedly have no electri cal charge. However, the neutron exhibits a magnetic moment that betrays the presence of electrical charge in its composition and all we really know about the p roperties of a neutron apply to something that onl y exists as an unstable particle having a mean lifetime of the order of 15 minutes . It is mere hypothesis to suggest that neutrons exist alongside p rotons in atomic nuclei and so exist as a majo r component of matter. In fact, beta particles (electrons and positrons) have a stronger claim to a presence in atomic nuclei and these can serve with protons to account for all the properties of the atomic nucleus. Essentially, the point made here is that Newton de vised his laws without taking proper account of the electrodynamics of interacting charge s and the fact that all matter, ev en matter we see as electrically neutral, comprises nothing other than such charged particles. In the electric discharges of the Correa apparatus we have a scenario where heavy atomic ions, rather than mere electrons, are also the charge carriers. A rarefied gas, such as argon, in the discharge tube is ionised and the heavy positive ions are pulled one way by an electric fiel d, whilst the electrons go the other way. The current flow is that of electrons in one part of a cl osed circuit but at least partially that of heavy ions in another part of the same closed circuit. To understand the physics involved, we need to know whether Newtonian principles hold va lid in such a case and whether even standard electrodynamic principles hold valid having regard to the fact that their empi rical basis is not the testing of current circuits where he avy ions flow in one circuit segm ent and electrons flow in another circuit segment. There are undisputed and unexplained anomalies of record in the sc ience literature concerning the very substantial cathode reaction forces set up in what has come to be termed a cold cathode discharge. These have been menti oned already but the Correa patent specifications reference several other sources and the data provided in the Correa patents include me asurements of such forces in the apparatus tested by Dr. Correa. In the cold cathode discharge thermionic emission of electrons from the cathode is avoided and an electric potential set up between anode and cathode is relied upon to trigger the discharge. Ostensibly, it seems that there is a force acting on the cathode with no counterpart force acting on the anode The root of our problem then has two offshoots, one being the Newtonian origin of the principle of conservation of momentum and th e other being a feature of accep ted electrodynamic law that says that interaction forces act on char g e at ri g ht an g les to their motion. Pa g e 8 of 37 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es8/Re p 8.htm"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"There is contradiction of principle here and vi rtually all physics text books contrive to avoid discussion on this enigmatic problem. If an electrodynamic force acts on charge at right angles to its motion it cannot do any work. This means that ther e can be no exchange of energy with the field background owing to that inter action and other than the energy deployments that arise from electrostatic potential. It means that physics theory obscures the process of electromagnetic induction by relying on an incompatible mixture of empirical formulations which serve us well in engineering design, provided we do not trespass into territory outsi de the scope of the empirical protocol relevant to our problem. The Correa invention lies in that outside territory because the current circuit through the discharge tube is not one involving a closed all-el ectron flow such as was used in one or other of the interacting circuits that gave ba sis for the accepted empirical data. It is well accepted that if there can be any breach of th e principle of conserva tion of momentum then there is scope for gaining, or losi ng energy, anomalously, in seeming contradiction with the principle of conservation of energy. However, one needs to be careful to be sure that one is looking at a total system. If the field background contains energy, even the energy stored by magnetic induction, it must participate in the energy conservation proces s and that field background is not something we can isolate as belonging exclusively to a particular charged particle or a particular current circuit. There is enough energy activity in the vacuum (the aether) owing to its intrinsic charge motion that underlies the quantum control of atomic electrons to assure the buffer needed to keep faith with the law of energy conservation, whatever anomalous forces ar e developed in any apparatus we can build. In the university teaching of dynamics as eviden ced by a textbook by an author in Cambridge, the seat of learning a ttended by Isaac Newton, a nd published by Cambridge University Press, the p rinciple of conservation of momentum is deduc ed by the preliminary a ssumption that internal actions and reactions between partic les are equal and opposite in pairs . It is as if each and every p aired combination of particles interact with one another w ithout any dependence upon anything else. This is manifestly not the case for the el ectrodynamic interaction becau se electrodynamics has a dependence upon motion relative to a frame of electro magnetic reference, something totally absent from Newtonian mechanics. When Einstein tried to bring conformity between inertial a nd electromagnetic effects his transformations of the space and time dimensions le d him to the Lorentz for ce law, which prescribes that the interaction force between tw o electric charges in motion is not directed between the two charges as internal actions and reactions between particles that are equal and opposite in pairs . This condition is only met where the tw o charges travel at the same speed side-by-side along parallel p aths and this clearly is not the case for the discharge current through the tubes used in the Correa apparatus. An electrical discharge likes to form a kind of fila mentary current with charge travelling in line, each ion or electron following behind its like form but the negatively charged electrons dodging around the heavy ions or even replacing elec trons in the atomic ion and neutralizing its state. It follows, therefore, that, whether one relies on th e principles of Newton or Einstein, or both, these being the accepted doctrines, the resulting theory will have no certain b earing on the practical situation encountered by the Correa research. This means that, with the vast majority of scientis ts all conforming with the restrictive disciplines of p hysics that confine knowledge to conventional t echnology, those few who venture into the new energy world with an open mind confront some very significant opportunities. So, first and foremost, we must be prepared, when considering certain very special situations in electrodynamics, to go against the teachings of our profession and pay attent ion to the messages in the experimental findings disclosed by the Dr . Paulo Correa and Mrs. Alexandra Correa.

This provided the onward inspiration for questioning how th e electrodynamic interaction betw een two electric charges in motion is affected if they have the same charge magnitude but different mass. There was, in the metal, a magnetic field reaction which was not properly factored into the diamagnetic state as analyzed in conventional theory. It was in fact ignored, because energy was not the fo cus of attention in the use of the Lorentz field formulation, but if its energy role had been duly not ed and incorporated in the theory of the steady field situation, it would have gi ven explanation of the factor-of- 2 anomaly that be came known as the g-factor. This is a phenomenon of charge in orbita l motion, but theoretical physicists sought to solve the problem by inventing what they called 'spin', even though a charge which `spins' is not moving its centre of charge and so its field is not ch anged by a changing spin condition. There are angular momentum issues involved here in relation to ma gnetic moments and the g-factor was measured in solid metal rods by the ratio of these two quantities. The essential step needed to explain that factor- of-2 in terms of orbital reacti on of electron motion required taki ng the argument from within the metal to the external vacuum field. There has to be in the aether the same ba sic g-factor reaction as applies within a metal conductor and this clearly poi nts to the g-factor reacti on being at the heart of the field energy storage by magneti c induction. The aether and its angular momentum properties as well the thermodynamic proper ties associated with the activity of its charge composition cannot just be brushed out of sight by a flour ish of the mathematician's pen. I interject here the comment that I am not unaware of the anomalous g-factor account afforded by Q.E.D., the theory of quantum electrodynamics. Th is is regarded as being the only theory of relevance on the subject of electron dynamics, because it can explain the g/2 factor of the electron as being 1.001159652. It involves copious ma thematical exercises that are far too extensive to be fully worked through and documented to that precisio n in any textbook. Indeed, as the successive advances in precision measuremen t crept to this quoted value, th e theoretical physicist was always found to be lagging behind in trying to work through to the next iteration in the calculation. If, on the other hand, the reader would like to see a de rivation of the factor 1.001159652200 fully presented in only three printed pages, the refe rence is the Lett. Nuovo Cimento, 32 , 114-116 (1981), this being a well known English language periodical published by the Italian Institute of Physics which was noted for its rapid publication of new scientific contributions. A later very relevant reference on the same them e, but more closely connected with the energy source we are concerned with in the Correa inven tion, is my paper entitled 'Fundamental constants derived from two-dime nsional harmonic oscillati ons in an electrically structured vacuum', which appeared in Speculations in Science and Technology, 9 , 315-323 (1986). This paper, as the title implies, referred to synchronizing constraints as betw een aether charge in its qua ntum activity as part of the vacuum medium. The anal ysis, which is quite brief, is also reproduced in my new book 'Aether Science Papers'. As energy is 'lost', as by thermal radiation into outer space, it is absorbed into the quantum activity o f a two-dimensional oscill ating system. There is equipartit ion of energy as between charge displacement and kinetic energy. Now, if this energy system of the fi eld medium is caused to move in one region relative to another region of that same medium, th is invokes that constraining action b ecause the aether charge is kept in synchronized motion at a universal rhythm, the photon frequency at which the surplus energy can materialize as elec tron pairs or heavy electron pairs (the latter being otherwise known as `muons'). If, on the other hand, one interferes with this act ivity by producing a positively charged cluster of ions, this sets up a radial electric field and forces radial charge displacement in that aether medium. This would u p set the timin g as each dis p laced element of aether char g e in its q uantum orbit moves Pa g e 10 of 37 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es8/Re p 8.htm"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"faster about the centre of the orbit in one half cycle and then slower in the next half cycle. However, the synchronizing power coupled to all that energy in the aether resists that and assures a perfect p hase-lock with the result that, to hold smoothly in th at state, the whole system of aether charge has to rotate about the centre of that radial electric field. The glow di scharge in the Correa tube becomes the seat of what this author has called 'vacuum spin'. Such a spin condition derives its power by drawing on energy from the universal field system e nveloping the glow discharge. In other words, the action promotes the inflow of aether energy from outer space. The key to all this is that synchr onizing influence or phase-lock that is at the very heart of quantum theory, this being a theory that represents the pr operties of the harmonic os cillator and is governing at the microcosmic level where individual electron motions are coupled to the action quantum. Planck's constant is, in fact, determined by the stru ctural form of the array of aether charge which constitutes the elusive, but real , medium we call the 'vacuum'. This link between the vacuum medium or vacuum energy field and electrons is crucial to our p roblem of tapping energy from what we see as empty space, but to get things started we need to set up that positive core charge. Here, rather than just using electric field effe cts to pull electrons out faster than the positive ions can make their way to the cathode of a discharge tube, we find that the action can be augmented electrodynamically as a function of current discharge. The heavier mass of the positive io ns helps enormously in making th em more sluggish, but it needs real force to compress those ions into a posit ive ball of plasma and here the anomalous electrodynamic interaction forces along th e current axis become effective. It is a curious fact of accepted physics that the in teraction forces between tw o charges in motion are assumed not to have any dependence upon the mass of the particles transporting those charges. We use Newtonian mechanics to argue that momentum has to be conserved, mome ntum depending upon mass, but somehow eliminate mass from the el ectrodynamic problem. Why then should we be surprised to hear that when experiments are perf ormed involving charge interactions between heavy p articles and light particles, atomic or molecu lar ions and electrons, we encounter energy and momentum anomalies? The very substantial anomalous ca thode reaction forces observed in reported experiments indicate that a powerful force is exerted on the cathode with no counterpart reaction on the anode. They indicate, by theory alone, that energy is being shed by the inductive system in excess of that supplied when the discharges through the device are pulse d. However, the Correa research gives us the experimental proof. As an aside here, it is mentioned that the energy s ource is much the same as that already discussed in Report No. 1 in this series, where the author has pur sued his interest in ferromagnetism to show that the energy set up inductively in a gap between tw o magnetic poles can exceed the energy input to a magnetizing winding. The energy source in the latter case is the quantum priming of the electron motion in the atoms in the ferromagnet. However, in the Correa situation, access to that energy is more directly associated with the motion of the unde rlying electromagnetic fr ame of reference. In a sense, the quantum world involves microscopic orbital motion of a charge system constituting the vacuum medium at a very high frequency, the Compton electron fr equency, whereas superimposed on this there is a low frequency rotation of a very extensive electromagnetic system. Both of these motions feed the anomalous energy to the Correa apparatus. The Earth would have to stop rotating and to arre st its translational motion with the local galaxy before the energy resource harn essed by the electrodynamic action in the Correa apparatus can be exhausted. However, the energy of the quantum acti vity at that Compton fr equency will never be exhausted, simply because the rest condition of the vacuum medium is one of negative electric p otential and the absolute g round state cannot g o sub-zero an y where.

N ow, physicists, except at least for this author who is also professionally quali fied as a physicist, are locked into the belief that momentum as well as angular momentum are conserved, meaning that an isolated system cannot by its internal interact ions develop any angular momentum or linear momentum. For this reason, so far as they are at all interested in the problem, they have been very p erplexed by the fact that the sola r system has angular momentum th at is not zero. Indeed, the Sun and the planets all rotate in the same sense and so the Sun must have been created in a rotating state before it shed matter to form th e planets. By standard physical theo ry this is not possible but it is nevertheless an indisputable fact. How then have cosm ologists come to terms with this problem? It is all too easy to say that the angular momentum was th ere, shared by matter in its galactic circulation, before that matter condensed to form the Sun, but that says nothing about how it all started. One hypothesis was that another st ar grazed past the Sun to set it in rotation and in the process disperse the matter that condensed to form the planets. Yet when the chance of this occurring was estimated it was found so improbable that of all the stellar systems in the universe the solar system would p ossibly be unique as the one havi ng planets. Another hypothesis was that all the stars were created together in a Big Bang and were so close at the time that they could exchange angular momentum and so move outwards in a spinning state. What is not seen as possible by accepted physics teaching is the acquisition of angular momentum and linear momentum as energy was fed into the nuc leating star to create it . Energy transfer from 'somewhere' surely implies that momentum and angular momentum can flow in from that same 'somewhere'. So it seems very logical for some of us to be open to the possibility that somehow N ature has a way of breaking faith wi th what we have adopted as the laws of physics, because, as surely as the Sun was created, there is a physical process that is non compliant with our modern p hysics teaching. The author submits that it was the initial onset of gravitation that triggered crea tion and caused the dispersed electric charges in the universe to conde nse to form stars, in much the same way as ferromagnetism appears in iron as it cools through its Curie temperature. This brings into account the anomalous transfer of energy and momentum to matter. The heavy protons would converge to form the stellar nucleus before the lighter-mass electrons could come together to neutralize the star so formed. The electrodynamic interact ions between electrons and hea vy ions during this primordial p eriod would set up the linear mome ntum of the star and the transient radial electric field in the conductive plasma would develop the vacuum spin which imparts the angular momentum. The technological discovery evident from the Correa research is therefore giving direct evidence of the anomalous electrodynamic force interactions betw een heavy ions and electrons, which go hand in hand with anomalous momentum and anomalous en ergy. The physics involved in such research is much closer to the subject of energy powering the Sun than is the physics of nuclear fusion. Readers who decide to look up thei r book references on Newton's laws should consider the right way and the wrong way of presenting those laws in the light of our knowledge of electrodynamics. N ewton himself, if he were alive today, would surely be prepared to restyle his argument if, by doing so, he could adapt the laws to extend their c over beyond macroscopic mech anics and embrace the microscopic dynamics of electr ic particle interactions. Firstly, note that it is Newton's third law of motion that is in issue, the balance of action and reaction. N ewton combined this law with the principle of c onservation of energy and was able to deduce that two particles, not necessarily having the same mass, would emerge from a collision with their relative velocity reversed. In sharing their energy the velocities of the two par ticles have to adjust so as to assure that the y se p arate from the collision with a relative velocit y that is -1 times their relative Pa g e 12 of 37 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es8/Re p 8.htm"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"velocity just before impact. This is known in mechanics as 'Newton's rule'. Secondly, note that it is logical that if two condi tions determine a third condition then that third condition taken with one of the two conditions can determine the other of the two conditions. If, therefore, Newton had taken his 'rule' to be his third law, especially as it is more easily demonstrated, as by propelling a metal ball into another at rest and observing that it transfers its motion to that other ball, then he would have got things the right way around. The new law would be a 'law of relative motion' and, taken together with the pr inciple of energy conservation, one can then deduce that action and reaction follows 'as a rule'. Thirdly, given this latter entry to the physics of electrodynamics, one can give support to the 'law of relative motion' because electric charge interactions are depende nt upon relative position and so upon relative motion, but not dependent upon mechanical inertia. Fourthly, however, we have a new scenario once el ectrodynamics get into the act, because whereas a p ure mechanical system involves the summation of discrete collisions between pairs of constituent p articles, which only see their own en ergies as involved at the instant of collision, the case is entirely different for the electrodynamic interaction. The reas on is that there will invariably be numerous other electric particles in motion in the immediat e locality of the colliding charges. The conserved energy is not exclusively that of a collisi on between a discrete pair of charges. In the latter situation the derivation of the 'rule' that action and reaction are always equal will fail. Energy will always be conserved but one cannot in this case formulate the relevant energy exclusively in terms of the square of a relative velocity. In mathematics every square power of a quantity has two roots, one positive and one negative, which is why we see the relative velocity of two colliding balls reverse after th eir impact. It is all a question of mixing vector and scalar quantities. Energy is a scalar quantity but veloc ity is a vector. We can take numerous particles conforming with linear ve ctor equations and add their indivi dual contributions to determine the overall state of a combined system, but once we start changing those vectors by working out the square roots of component scalar energy quantities, without being able to exclude the external cross interactions between charges acting on the two in collision, we really are headed for trouble. The well proven laws we have accepted for mechan ics cannot be applied to practical situations where there is a dominant electrodynamic effect i nvolving the interaction of electrons and heavy ions. This rider has been added because Nature contrives to deceive us in a rather curious way when we apply the Newtonian philosophy to the electrodynamics of the closed circui tal all-electron current flow. We find we can use the Lorentz force law wh ich does not conform with Newton's law of action balancing and reaction and apply this to all the disc rete elemental current circ uit interactions to find in the end that they sum to give the balance needed to satisfy Newton's law for the circuit as a whole. This is a quirk of the mathematics of this situ ation combined with the fact that the Lorentz formulation prescribes force on charge in motion act ing at right angles to that motion. A force so directed can do no work and so the summation of all the individual inte ractions will result in no work being done, meaning that th e circuit carrying current is not givi ng or drawing power from its field environment. It can therefore not assert force on that environment a nd so internally its action overall must balance its reaction. Yet, as soon as we change that current, there is inductive energy exchange with that field environment, which means that somehow the forces on the electrons moving through that circuit are no longer at right angles to ch arge motion. Electric fiel ds have been set up by induction effects and the moment thes e are introduced one is bringing in to play empirical rules, all o f which have been discovered by experiments where at least one of the interacting current sources is all-electron closed circuit flow or its e q uivalent.

In fact, analysis shows that it is the mass ratio between two inte racting charge carriers that is the dominant consideration and it so happens that in the all-elec tron current flow circuit th is ratio is unity, thereby disguising its true relevance in an electrodynamic formulation. Once that ratio is measured in thousands as is the case the heavy ion to electron ma ss ratio, then we enter a whole new scenario, the one into which the Correa research has ventured. In summary, therefore, the root of the problem of understanding why the Correa apparatus actually works is intermeshed with the basic principles of Newtonian mechanics and their inadequacy in coping with the conditions peculiar to the electrodynamic interaction. To adjust our theories to the facts of the Correa experiments and at the same time bring conf ormity and unification into the connection between Newtonian mechanics, gravitati on and electromagnetism, we need to correct the empirical law of electro-dynamics so that it embraces the intera ction between heavy ions and electrons. There has to be a mass te rm in the law of electrodynamics. This author derived the inter-electron interaction law nearly 40 years ago and the version with the mass ratio term some 30 years ago but it was not unt il 1969 that its derivation featured in a scientific p aper as published by the Journal of the Franklin Institute. This was re ferenced in the earlier introduction. The law thus formul ated in no way conflicts with the accepted Lorentz law when applied to the same problems, those involving closed circuital electron curren t. It indicates powerful anomalous forces on heavy ions flowing between electrodes in a gas discharge tube where the current circuit is completed by a pa rtially closed electron circuit. These anomalous forces generate the build up of electric ch arge at the cathode whic h establishes the condition needed to trigger excess p ower output from the Correa discharge tube. The Dilemma Confronted Hopefully the reader will now join the author in confronting the dilemma which has been introduced in the foregoing pages. We have on the one hand certain anomalous facts of experiment which ha ve been building up over many years and are now crowned, not so much by the Correa discovery, but by the fact that the Correa patents disclose so much e xperimental data that technologists have the way charted to begin to invade the new energy world. We have on the other hand a well established scientif ic belief system enshrine d in notions of the so- called Big Bang creation of the universe and the notions of a rela tivistic four-dimen sional space-time metric which aims to destroys belie f in an aether brimming with energy. We have intermediate these ex tremes the knowledge that physicis ts and cosmologists openly admit that they are still searching for their Holy Grai l, the Unified Field Theo ry, by which they mean a theory conforming with the Einstein doctrine but yet bridging the gap between electrodynamics and gravitation. Supplementary to this we have th e very extensive theoretical contri butions of this author, all built on the revision of physics resulting from acceptance of a vacuum en ergy medium and that law of electrodynamics as adjusted to permit anomalous force imbalance in the interaction of moving electric charges of different ma ss. The author's theory is an all-embracing unified field theory. In the appendices which follow this text many of th e relevant references will be listed.

This is why the experimental discovery demons trable by Dr. Paulo Correa and Mrs Alexandra Correa is of vital importance, not just as a way forw ard which offers us direct access to a new source of energy, but for its sc ientific si gnificance. The anomalous cathode reac tion forces discovered and duly re corded by past experimenters have been swept aside by physicists with the presump tion that there must be sufficient electrode vaporization to explain the cathode reaction force. That process would, of course, impart a back p ressure on the vapour that would assert a balanci ng force on the anode. However, I am not aware of any tests that confirm the balancing reaction on th e anode and I find it difficult to understand how vaporization of a metal can impart much more energy to the freed atoms than is implicit in the latent heat of vaporization. See the later comment on this point. The generation of excess energy in s eeming breach of the law of acti on and reaction is the decisive factor in determining the scientif ic truths involved in this situa tion and the Correas have taken us forward decisively on that front. What lies ahead, therefore, is not only the entry into a new energy regime, but the prospect of a developing thrust in aerospace a pplications and a scientific revolut ion as the extremes of modern p hilosophy in physics collapse into a more rational picture. The dilemma the reader now faces is whether to do nothing and simply watch events, leaving the task to others, or whether to explore and probe th e Correa claims to try to trace a flaw in their experiments, (if there is one to be found!) or whet her to stand by the principle that what amounts to 'perpetual motion' is impossible and so pass j udgment solely on the strength of that conviction. It may or may not help the argument to say that each atom in the reader's body exemplifies the reality of 'perpetual moti on', because if the reader were to die and be cooled down to the absolute zero of temperature, minus 273 o C, the electrons in every atom in the reader's body would keep moving perpetually. All that is suggested by the new theory underlying the new energy science is that, by understanding the quantum acti vity of the aether and showing how it determines the Planck constant and regulates electron mo tion in atoms, we can see a way forward to tapping into that energy system. The obvious challenge comes in the statement: \"P rove it by demonstrating something that works.\" Well, the Correas have done that! Yet even that will not be enough to turn the scientific world upside down, because the cry then is: \"Where does the en ergy come from?\" Well, the author has outlined the explanation above! Yet that will not be enough, b ecause the scientists who are able to judge the theoretical arguments would rather not waste time in that effort, be ing so confident that there must be flaws. So, assuming the worst case scenario, the final arbite r is likely to be the public at large, those who care little about where the energy comes from, so long as it is cheap, plentiful and non-polluting. That means that we will need to see several t echnologies develop all generating energy in a way which confounds the physicists but all aimed at the domestic market or the small user, such as by p roviding back up power to keep el ectric batteries on a boat charged when the boat is not being used. In saying this, the author is aware of initiatives around the world and particul arly in Japan which do seem to be backed by adequate funding and which suggest a lower level of prejudice against the new energy theme. So it is really now a question of waiting to see how the situation develops, trusting that what is explained in this Report will contribute to forward developments.

This is why much of the remainder of this Report simply gives references and abstracts as there seems little that needs further expl anation other than the provision of a brief description of the way in which the Correa tube taps aether energy.

There will be scope for more invention in imp roved design structure of the electrode configurations and c hoice and composition of electrode materials, but there are some new and interesting principles embodied in the patented Correa apparatus and these should survive and have value as the technology comes into commercial use. I am writing this section of text on February 13, 1996 and have just received my copy of the February 1996 issue of New Energy News, a monthl y publication edited by Dr. Hal Fox and issued from a postal address P.O. Box 58639, Salt Lake City, UT 84158-8639. At pp. 10-12 I summarized the 1 hr documentary shown on British televi sion on 17th December 1995 concerning 'free energy'. That programme included reference to research on energy from plasma discharges, notably by reference to the research of Professor Cherne tskii in Moscow, but the programme was compiled before news concerning the Correa discovery came to light. Accord ingly, in my submission to New Energy News I did refer to the Correa research in Canada. I find, incidentall y, that the editor, Hal Fox, interjected the additional note that \"The wo rk by Kucherov, Karabit & Savitimova has also shown excess heat generation from a `glow discharge'\", but I have at this time no data on that subject. The remaining body of this Report will concentrate on a simple illustrated exposition as to why the abnormal glow discharge in a Correa tube genera tes excess energy and how that energy is taken off as electric power rather than as h eat. So far as possible what is pres ented will be extracts from what has already been published on the subject, since it is not appropriate to elaborate new theories to explain the operation of the technology discovere d by Dr. Paulo N. Correa and Mrs Alexandra Correa. The object here is to show that the scient ific basis of the discovery is something in common with natural phenomena that have hitherto defi ed accepted explanation when the physics was there on record but was ignored. Operational Characteristics of Correa Discharge Device The excess energy mode of operati on of a typical Correa discharge device involves cyclic current oscillations in the EF region of the operational characteristic depict ed in Fig. 1 of U.S. Patent No. 5,416,391.

The plotted data show how current varies as the voltage between the electrodes increases. There are two regions of negative resistance. The one at higher curren t is used to develop pulsating current oscillations which allow excess energy to be drawn from the device. To get current to flow between the two electrode s in a cold-cathode discharge tube containing a rarefied inert gas such as argon a sufficient voltage , of the order of 1,000 V, is needed to initiate ionization. Much then depends upon the circuit conn ected to the tube and the load conditions that can limit the current to certain levels, which in th e case of the Correa invention hold the current in a stable pulsating oscillation mode. Normally the curr ent will climb to the VAD region where the high current vacuum arc discharge condition applies. That state does not deliver excess energy output. Once the ions are formed (Fig. 2) a flow of cu rrent through the tube arises by the attraction of electrons to the anode and the mi g ration of the p ositive ions owin g to their attraction to the cathode.

This means that there will be a ra dially directed electric field gradie nt from the centre of the glow discharge. Now, how does the medium to which we attribute electromagnetic wave propagation in terms of Maxwell's displacement current respond to a radial electric field? It responds by trying to cancel the plasma charge field, just as it does in a parallel plate capacitor. Nevertheless there is a difference. There the electric field is applied fr om outside, namely from the electrodes, and the Maxwell displacement, which comprises two separate d layers of charge of opposite polarity, simply confronts the charge on the plate electrodes and sc reens it by placing one polarity charge adjacent one plate electrode and the other polarit y charge adjacent the other electrode. In the absence of an electric field vector, the s calar reaction of the aether is to store energy by equipartition between kinetic an d electric displacement energy by e xpanding the radii of the orbital quantized motion of the elements of its aether charge. This is the basis of this author's theory for the p hoton and the derivation of the theoretical value of the fine-structure constant [Reference 2 in the bibliography]. The aether responds to the field vector mode of a linear electric field displacement by storing energy as electrical field energy. This amount s to an internal strain in the aether and, if a gas is present, it may become ionized. Here there is translational motion of the char ge system in the aether but no kinetic energy is added to its overa ll quantum state because the displace ment of the charge orbits in local aether regions is affected by synchronizing c onstraints exerted from external aether regions which assure phase lock. These constraints, rath er than the applied electrical field, provide the energy needed to sustain that translational motion. This is why the aether cannot be sensed in terms of the mechanics of linear motion. This aspect is a subject mentione d in reference [57]. The aether responds similarly in response to the radi al electric field vector, be cause it is able to set up a state of spin or rotation wh ich involves inflow of kinetic energy in the aether itself, energy which is supplied from the external aether owing to the phase-lock just mentioned. In this case, if the external influence which sets up the radial electric field subsides in strength, the phase-lock persists b ut the kinetic energy which has been fed into the fi eld system from the external aether cannot return to its source by virtue of that same phase-lock. This is akin to the situation where a dog with its feet firmly locked to the ground can wag its tail, but the tail cannot wag the dog and, with it, body Earth. Therefore, the energy in the aether spin has to be shed in a different way, but by virtue of the s y nchronizin g constraint which now forces a radial char g e dis p lacement p owered b y the ca p tured Pa g e 18 of 37 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es8/Re p 8.htm"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"aether spin energy. In other words, what is stored in the spin state as aether input energy becomes available as electric field energy which can be tapped by drawing power from the electrodes of the Co rrea tube, just as if the glow discharge were a capacitor. To do this it is necessary to have pulsations a nd here there is an aspect which warrants further theoretical research, but which seems to have alre ady found a practical soluti on in the Correa device. The point of interest is that, in theory, we need to add as many joul es of energy to build the electric field condition as we can expect to draw in as excess energy from the enveloping aether. This is because the aether has certain harm onious features consistent with equipartition of energy between electric and dynamic (kinetic or magnetic) stat es. The puzzle then is that of understanding how energy efficiencies in excess of 200% are possible. Th e answer is easily found if there is a Q factor applicable to the circuit, meaning that the electrical energy oscillates as between the discharge and an external capacitor. However, it may well be that in the Correa tube the extended form of the cathode in relation to the electrode spacing allows mu ltiple discharge zones which can cooperate in exchanging some portion of the electric energy whil st the aether energy infl ow is pumped into all such zones in each external pulse cycle. In summary, therefore, there are undoubtedly some ve ry special advantages in the way in which the Correa discharge tubes are designed. The design of the electrode configuration as covered by the Correa patent position seems theref ore to be crucial to securing hi gh conversion efficiencies with excess power generation we ll in excess of 200%. What is clear is that the radial separation of positive and negative charge in the plasma in the Correa discharge tube will capture large amounts of aether energy. Fig. 3 de picts that radial separation and shows two capacitors denoted C which make a circuit connection with a load resistance.

The rate at which positive ions are being created will drop as well and so the radial electric field can fall below the value corresponding to the state of aether spin. This then uses the kinetic energy of the aether spin to set up radial el ectric field displacement in the aether itself and that, in turn, releases the plasma charge at a higher potential, corresponding to that negative resistance characteristic. The result is that the t ube delivers power drawing on aether spin and sheds it in those output current pulsations that are ch annelled around the a.c. shunt loop through the load resistor shown in Fig. 3. N ow, to accentuate this effect, one of the features of the Correa patents involves a discharge tube having an extended cathode structure with a relative ly small anode in fairly close proximity. As indicated in Fig. 4, this has the e ffect of spreading the cathode cu rrent and so the distribution of p ositive ions over the area of the extended cathode, wh ilst the anode current is more confined to the central part of the tube. Fig. 4 ..........................Fig. 5 Thus, in Fig 5, the way in which current flows thr ough the tube is illustrated by the separation of p ositive ions and electrons. These can recombine, as by the electrons entering the anode migrating around the d.c. supply circuit path to find their way to the cathode. Ho wever, the significant point of interest is that the AGD discharge has a charge storage feature which is depicted by the notional capacitors illustrate d inside the tube. One has then to visualise a region of aether spi nning about the centre of that plasma forming the glow discharge and contriving to contain the build-up of an enorm ous amount of charge separation. Under the cyclic relaxation control of the suitably-a djusted parameters of the external load circuit, the oscillation which develops can literally pump en ergy from the aether as the positive ion state of the plasma is increased and allowed to decrease, increasing under control of the power input, but decreasing spontaneously to draw on the aether energy stored once the input loses control. It is not the purpose of this Report to describe pr ecisely how the circuits of the Correa experiments are designed to exploit this phe nomenon, but before mentioning othe r related research and before giving further explanation of the physics underl ying the spin phenomena, one example of the reported performance data will be quoted from U.S. Patent N o. 5,449,989. That patent together with the other two already mentioned show several circ uit diagrams to which the reader can refer.

The experiment begins with the driver pack at a vo ltage of 582 V, corresponding to 12.65 V per cell, which was an 87.5% state of charge . The charge pack had an initia l voltage of 328 V, corresponding to 11.71 V per cell, which is a 20% state of charge. The cathode in the discharge tube was of harden ed aluminium and had an area of 64 sq. cm. There was a 4 cm. gap between electrodes and the gas pressure in the tube was 0.8 Torr. The experiment ran for 28.5 minutes. Thereafter, the driver pack was found to have lost ve ry little of its charge, its voltage having reduced to 579.5 V, corresponding to an 84% state of char ge. It had shed 0.134 kWh of energy. In contrast the charge pack had climbed to a voltage of 350 V and become 76.5% charge d, an energy increase o f 1.213 Kwh, which is a ninefold increase. The ener gy conversion efficiency was greater than 900%. The Vapour Reaction Hypothesis The conventional assumption concer ning cathode reaction force in the cold-cathode discharge is that the discharge involves vaporization of the cathode material. The reacti on force on the cathode is then attributed to the rate at which momentum is im parted to the ejected va pour. The speed of ejection times the rate of loss of cathode mass should then equal the measured anomalous force. It is therefore interesting to compare that speed, a nd the kinetic energy it impli es for an atom shed by the cathode, with the thermal state of such an atom just prior to its release, as determined from the latent heat of evaporation of the cathode metal. For an aluminium cathode, given that the latent he at of evaporation is 10,800 J/gm, the speed of the vaporized atoms can be little mo re than 5,000 m/s. This is estimated by equating the kinetic energy of unit mass to the energy 10,800 J. It follows th at, the force of 245.2 dynes as measured and reported in Table 15 of the third of the Correa U.S. patents for a current of 1.6 A, will require the cathode to vaporize at the rate of 490.4 10 -6 gm/s to impart the necessary rate of reaction momentum to account for that cathode reaction force. This a ssumes that the force is not set up by electrodynamic action. N ow, in column 20 of U.S. Patent 5,449,989 the rate of erosion of cathode material is discussed on the basis of the Correa data on actual measurements of craters formed by va porization activity. That data allows the conclusion to be drawn that elect rodes having a mass of less than 100 gm would have a useful life equivalent to th e generation of power of 40 Mwh. Assigning 250 V to the 1.6 A current implies output power of 400 W and, if that were to consume the cathode at the rate estimated above, a 100 gm electrode would be consumed in 56 hours, corresponding to a lifetime en ergy production of 0.0224 Mwh. This is discrepant by a factor of the order of 1,000 when compared with the erosion observed. It follows, therefore, that the cathode reaction force has to be almost w holly attributable to some cause other that reaction produced by va porization. Hence the anomaly already discussed in connection with this new source of energy! The Author's 1977 Plasma Discharge Device This was the sub j ect of U.K. p atent A pp lication No. 2,002,953.

One is quite topical in that it has attracted media interest in the v acuum as a new energy source. The paper generating that interest is that of C. Eber lein in Physical Review Letters 76 , 3842-3845 (1996) entitled 'Sonoluminescence as quantum vacuum radiation'. It is the phenomenon by which sonic pulsations applied to water result in the water emitting optical radiation which betrays the release of energy in bursts which signify high temperat ures. See also the report by Peter Knight 'Sound, Light and the Vacuum' in News and Views in the journal Nature ( 381 , pp. 736-737, 27 June 1996). This phenomenon is of little practical consequen ce when measured against the discovery underlying the Correa invention, but it shows that scientists need to face up to the reality of the new energy world. The sonoluminescence phenomenon is, in my opinion, another manifest ation of the vacuum spin scenario. By compressi ng tiny air bubbles at frequenc ies of 25 kHz the positive H 3 O hydronium ions and the negative OH hydroxyl ions in water converge radially towards each bubble of air during the pressure impulse period. The heavier ions re spond more slowly and each such pulse sets up a small radial electric field displ acement. This induces aether spin or vacuum spin, with inflow of energy from the quantum underworld, owing to the pha se lock action of the quantum environment. As the pressure relaxes the ions do not recover thei r original positions owing to the neutralizing field effects inherent in the aether spi n. Each successive sonic pressure pulse then augments the effect by forcing further radial charge displacement. This is an escalating situation broken only when the build-up of vacuum spin energy centred on those air bubbles grow in physical size until instability sets in as by surface collision with other such spin states. These collisions in their random distribution will be triggered in time with the sonic pulsations and local flashes of light will be emitted. In effect what one sees is a kind of very tiny thunderball phenomenon, where the stimulus exciting the formation of the glowing balls is not an electrical discharge but a pressure wave. While physicists ponder on that sonoluminescence phenomenon, those interested in the practical p ursuit of the new energy opportunity can follow the Correa lead, confident th at scientists who decry the `free energy' prospect have their ow n problems in understanding sonoluminescence. As indicated earlier in this work, the theme of charge induction by vacuum spin featured in my 1977 lecture paper 'Space, Ener gy and Creation' and I stated that I would from quote something from the end of that text. This now follows: Finally, an interesting experiment has been performed by Ryan and Vonnegut (1971)*. They arranged for a cage to rotate around an electric arc discharge at quite lo w speed and found that this stabilised the arc. The task of stabilising an electric arc is one of the major problems of ther monuclear fusion res earch. It seems theref ore very difficult to believe that the wild antics of the arc discharge are tamed merely by the slow rotation of a column of air. Here then is more scope for research. Can an arc be stabili sed by a in a vacuum by cage rotation? It is research which the mode rn physicist will not readily undertake because there is widespr ead belief that the vacuum is a non-entity devoid of any special properties. It is a belief encouraged by the development of relativity and in my experience thos e who believe in relativity deny the existence of the aether. On the other hand I was once reassured by a comment Professor Cullwick** made about something I published. He quoted Einstein as saying: 'The special theory of relativity does no t compel us to deny the existence of th e ether .... there is weighty evidence in favour of the ether hypothesis.' (H.

Appendix II repr oduces my paper as read at an Institute of Physics conference at Oxford University, England in 1983. It provides the authentic explanation of the induction of the Earth's magnetic field as an aether phenomenon, cons istent with the foregoing analysis of operation of the Correa PAGD technology. The Logic of My Case 1. For there to be self-induction of electric or magnetic effects attri butable to the rotation of any system that system must comprise a composition of electric charges. 2. The electrostatic force acting between any two ch arges is directed along the line joining them and there is balance of action and reaction, meaning that the system will not de velop an out-of-balance reaction force that can enhance or retard a state of spin. 3. If the system is already spinning then there will be mutually-induced elect romagnetic forces acting on the charges as each moves under the influence of the field set up by the motion of other charge. 4. By the Lorentz force law these forces act at right-angles to the charge motion. The effective motion of each charge is in a circular orbit about the axis of spin and so any electromagnetic force must be radial with respect to that spin axis. This means that no force co mponent will enhance or retard the spin. 5.

A consequence of this is that there can be no circ ulating electric current induc ed inside that system owing to its rotation as that woul d draw on the inertial spin energy and mean that the spin speed must reduce. 7. This account does not preclude the setting up of EMFs in the body of the spinning system of charge because those EMFs would be balanced, meaning that the perime ter is at a different potential from that at the axis. 8. In an operable homopol ar generator based on the Faraday di sk principle there is a non-rotating return current circuit path external to the rota ting disk and that accounts for the unbalanced EMF around a circuit whilst providing the external structur e which can absorb the forces affecting the spin speed of the disk. 9. Body Earth has no external structure against which to apply the requisite fo rce action if it is to slow down owing to self-e xciting dynamo properties. The Alternative Solution There is, of course, a solution to the mystery of the Earth's magnetic field, but it depends upon something totally unfamiliar to thos e expert in the physics of field theory. It concerns 'vacuum spin' and a 'phase-lock' effect and that connects the phenomenon of the Earth's magnetic field with the energy activity intrinsic to the ae ther. It involves a process which taps that aether energy, which is why the subject is important in our quest to di scover a new and commercially viable source of energy. Appendix II should now be read, keeping in mind that the self-generati ng magnetic dynamo theory as an explanation for the Earth's magnetic field is flawed a nd must be rejected. _______ APPENDIX II THE THUNDERBALL - AN ELECTROSTATIC PHENOMENON This is the text of the author's paper as presen ted at Electrostatics 1983, Oxford and as published in Institute of Physics Conference Series No. 66 at pp. 179-184. Abstract A quasi-static electric displacem ent according to Maxwell's theo ry is considered in a novel context, that of a forced radial electric strain centred on a source of energy. The resulting balancing charge displacement in enveloping matter may have transient stabi lity and should exhibit ionization if gaseous. Potentially hazardous poc kets of migrant electrostatic energy may well be created in the vicinity of electric discharges. An alysis shows the energy c ontent to be within the range applicable to the thunderball, that is between 2x10 9 J/m 3 and 5x10 9 J/m 3 .

Introduction Maxwell's equations are very much a part of the accepted physics in use today. They are used without much regard for the physical model on wh ich Maxwell developed his theories. Jeans (1966) has referred to Maxwell's displacement theory as 'part of the scaffoldi ng by which electromagnetic theory was constructed' but said that it was an open question whet her this scaffolding ought now to be discarded. Some impetus in examining this question stems fr om the recent experimental discovery by Graham and Lahoz (1980) that the field medium can provide a reaction force to quasi-static fields. The evidence from this experiment , which is electromagnetic in character and depends upon current displacement between capacitor plat es, is so strong that the auth ors ended their paper with the comment that 'the quasi-static Ma xwell's field is not merely an invisible medium of interaction between matter and matter; it ha s in fact the mechan ical properties postulated by Maxwell, in contradistinction to any \"act ion at a distance\" theory'. This encourages the author to present a propos ition directly based upon Maxwell's displacement theory. The question at issue is whether the vacuum , as a physical medium in its own right, can be set in a state of electrical strain and might, under certain ci rcumstances, retain this strain transiently so as to store energy in a quasi-stable manner. In particular, it seems worthwhile to ask whether radial electric displacement centred on a source of en ergy has a role to play in physical phenomena. N ote that this contrasts with the lateral oscillatory displacement we associate with wave propagation. We are considering a static displacement such as is associated with the storage of energy by a charged capacitor. Fig. 1 We believe that when the parallel plates of the capacitor shown in Fig. 1 are electrified, as by the p otential V, the linear displacement in Maxwell's field medium (depicted by the arrows) effectively neutralizes the capacitor charge and stores energy in the state of stra in in the dielectric and the field medium itself. The hypothesis we now address is that Nature may operate in the reverse mode, p articularly in response to a radial displacement, and somehow sustain a state of radial electric strain in the vacuum medium so that it a sserts a primary role and causes th e electric charge in enveloping substance to take up neutralizing pos itions. Instead of the electricity applied to the capacitor causing energy to be stored, we have an event accompanied by the injection of energy into the strain storage s y stem of the field medium and a conse q uent electrical ad j ustment in matter.

If the field medium reacts in some way to preserve this strain and store ener gy in a quasi-stable form for a transient period before the electrons and i ons recombine, then the condition according to the hypothesis outlined above is achieve d. The resulting pocket of energy optimizes its form to that of a sphere and asserts a primary role in keeping th e positive and negative matter charge displaced, p ending eventual decay. Fig. 3 A useful concept giving strength to this hypothesis involves an imaginary st ate of spin, which we will term `vacuum spin'. The idea here is that if the vacuous field medium were to contain charges capable of displacement then it would be feasible to imagine a sphere of such a medium rotating as shown in Fi g . 3 about an axis throu g h the centre of the s p here.

Energy would be stored by the spin state and by the radial electric fields indu ced. In the presence of matter such as the atmosphere these fields might well be cancelled by ionizati on and separation of charge in the matter itself, leaving only the spin energy. Nevertheless, the spin would sustain the electric displa cement in the field medium and a transient state of ionization pending the eventual dissipation of the spin energy. Hence the vacuum spin concept does convey some understanding of th e quasi-stable character of the phenomenon under discussion. 2. Theoretical Analysis We can proceed to analyze a spherical field system subject to symmetrical radial strain, without further recourse to this spin concept and solely by reference to the char ge separation in matter. Consider a spherical shell of negative charge Q enveloping a uniform sphere of distributed charge +Q developed to balance the radial electric disp lacement. The electric energy is simply the sum of three terms. These are (i) the self-e nergy of the distributed charge 3Q 2 /5R, (ii) the self energy of the charge Q which is Q 2 /2R and (iii) the mutual energy of the in teraction between -Q and Q, which is Q 2 /R. The total electric energy becomes Q 2 /10R, where R is the radius of the sphere subject to the electric strain. Given this amount of energy applied to form th e spherical object under di scussion, we know that it will be characterized by a charge Q and a radius R connected by the above formula. To proceed further it is helpful now to digress a little and consider the possible creation of such a spherical object wholly within a la rger spherical object of similar ch aracter. This is possible because we are talking about fields and the field medi um and can envisage poc kets of this medium p ermeating matter. As depicted in Fi g. 4(a), a sub-sphere of electric st rain is contained wholly within a much larger sphere of electric strain. The st rains are radial in each sphere and combine to determine the strain energy density at points within the sub-sphere. B ecause the main sphere is very large in relation to the sub-sphere we can regard th e strain of the larger sphere as uniform over the volume of the smaller sphere. This means that when the electric st rain vectors of the spheres are combined at points within the sub-sphere the cross products will balance and so cancel to leave the energy needed to form the sub-sphere independe nt of the strain within the larger sphere. Fig. 4(a) ................................ Fig. 4(b) Fig. 4(a) shows a sub-sphere of radial strain within a larger sphere of radial strain and Fig. (b) shows an ion and it s associated electron influenced by a non-linear electric strain.

Thus, collectively each ion and its paired electron will form a system which is electrically neutral overall and which can be represented, as shown in Fig. 4(b) by a posit ive central charge surrounded by a spherically symmetrical negative charge distri bution attributable to the statisti cal random motion of the electron. This is because the electrons have a much smaller mass and a much greater speed and, though confined to the spherical boundary of the sub-sphere in order to balance the effects of the strain discussed above, they are less confined than any ions present at that boundary. Owing to this greater range of motion of the elect rons it is the polarity of the electrons that determines the direction in which ionized matter te nds to move in a non-lin ear electric field. For stable confinement to a sphere the electric strain everywhere within the bounds of that sphere must correspond to the action of a positive charge. Thus the radial electric strain of the sub-sphere at its surface is limited by the prevailing el ectric strain in the larger sphere and the latter must correspond to the action of a positive rather than negative charge. Fig. 5 Imagine now that what we have described occurs in our own environment, with the Earth and its ionosphere constituting the larger sphere and the subspheres being the thunderballs induced in the Earth's atmosphere. The Earth rotates, as depicted in Fig. 5, and so the charge just mentioned would rotate to produce a magnetic field attributable to a distributed positive charge and a balancing negative charge at the upper bounds of the atmosphere. Overall this would give the Earth a geomagnetic moment attributable to a negative charge, which is f ound to be the case. Furthermore, no electric field would be detected directly because the strain caus ed by vacuum spin would be balanced. It is well known (Rosser, 1968) that this strain causes no magnetic field itself as, otherwise, charged capacitors when rotating would induce no ma gnetic field, yet such a field is observed. The magnetic moment attributable to the collective action of a surface charge Q is readily shown to be: M = QR 2 /5c (1) where R is the body radius and is its angular speed. c is the speed of light. Note that this expression is in electrostatic units and both the dielectric cons tant and the magnetic perm eability are taken to be unity. For the Earth the geomagnetic moment M is 8.1x10 25 gauss-cm, R is 6.4x10 8 and is 7.26 10 5 rad/s. c is 3x10 10 cm/s. Thus Q is readily found and so the surface electric strain Q/R 2 as applicable in atmos p heric re g ions.

The mean energy density of any such sub-sphere is found by dividing Q 2 /10R by the volume 4R 3 /3, R now being the radius of a sub-sphere and Q its charge. This energy density is simply 3/40 times (Q/R 2 ) 2 and as this latter quantity is the same throughout the Earth's atmospheric layer we may expect all sub-spheres to have the same energy density. It is known that thunderballs all exhibit the same energy density, regardless of their size, as was reported by Altschuler et al (1970) and that this energy density lies in the range 2x10 9 J/m 3 to 5x10 9 J/m 3 . We have, therefore, an encour aging link with the hypothetical m odel under consideration. However, more than this, we find that the energy density calculated from the above expression and using the value of the parameter Q/R 2 derived for the Earth itself is 2.37x10 9 J/m 3 . The theory is therefore supported also by a quantitative conn ection with the geomagnetic field. 3. Discussion The greatest puzzle of all concerni ng thunderballs is thei r ability to pass th rough solid matter and still preserve their form. This is explained by the above theory. As a phenomenon of electric strain in the vacuum itself, a strain which is primary and sustained by some inner mechanism of the vacuum state, the thunderball can pass through solid matter ju st as easily as solid matter can pass through the vacuum. What is seen of the thunderball is merely the ionization in the a tmosphere resulting from the decay of the energy locked up in this state of strain. As the pocket of strain passes through solid matter any ionization on the entry side merely subs ides to be replaced by ionization on the exit side once the sub-sphere surface of the thunderball emerges. Another property of these objects is that they woul d exhibit a magnetic field of the same order as the Earth's magnetic field. This is quite small but, beari ng in mind that the mass of the thunderball is that of the field itself and therefore ne gligible, it needs very little for ce to displace them. Accordingly, it b ecomes possible to explain why thunderballs can hover over the surface of an aircraft wing in flight without being swept away in th e slipstream (Aspden, 1980). In separating from the conductive surface of the wing, eddy currents would be induced by weakening the flux linkage sourced in the ball. These would develop a magneti c attraction for the ball and resi st its separation, so holding the ball for a period in the pr oximity of the aircraft. Connected as they are with dramatic and dynamic ev ents such as lightning discharges, it may appear to be bold speculation to suggest that these glow ing spheres really are manifestations of a quasi- electrostatic effect. Yet, as we have seen, their unu sual properties can be e xplained on such a theory. Given data concerning the amount of energy release d, the theory suggests that the size of these objects is then determined by the standard energy density already estimated. This means that even a small amount of energy released by a discharge that is quite weak could produce a tiny thunderball. Since the electric field gradient is the same at the surface of all such objects and this is sufficient to ionize large and easily visible objec ts, we can expect even the smalle st to exhibit ionization as well. They become, therefore, a potential hazard where e xplosive and inflammable substances are present. They constitute an unexpected h azard because they have a durabilit y and a mobility not shared by other electrical phenomena. They are so elusive in character that they may exist without having been noticed except as an apparent illusion. Yet the thu nderball is unquestiona bly a real phenomenon and a dangerous one. In order to devise experiments by which thunderbal ls may be created and examined under controlled laborator y conditions, one needs at least to be g in with a viable h yp othesis as to their character.

The theory presen ted should be judged in the light of the very great spectrum of theories proposed hitherto and disc ounted for many reasons. See, for example, the excellent review articles by Golde (1977) and Char man (1979). Of more prac tical concern on a grand scale are the efforts of Nobel laureate Kapitza ( 1979) who, recognizing that the energy densities of the thunderball are of the right order for applicat ion in fusion reactors, seeks to create them artificially by R.F. techniques, this mechanism be ing his assumption of how these objects may derive their energy. Finally, it is noted that the author has explored in considerable depth the possible physical basis of the underlying `vacuum spin' on which the argumen t was developed (Aspden, 1980). It remains to devise and conduct experime nts aimed at induci ng this spin condition by usi ng radial elec tric fields, so as to verify and perhaps a pply the phenomenon to useful ends.

The Correa research findings have been my inspiration by opening the door givi ng access to that aether. It may be that the following list of my papers may se rve as a partial index giving guidance as to what also lies a little further behind that door.
