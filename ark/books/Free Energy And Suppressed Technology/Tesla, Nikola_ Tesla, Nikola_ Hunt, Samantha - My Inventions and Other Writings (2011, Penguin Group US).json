During his lifetime, he contributed immensely to the field of electricalengineering and is responsible for alternating current electricity, the bifilarcoil, and the bladeless turbine. He was chiefly responsible for the invention ofthe radio due to his research on wireless communication devices. Although lesswell known than his contemporaries Edison and Marconi, Tesla surpassed both withhis contributions to modern science. Supposedly because of his competitiverelationship with Edison—and their mutual inclination to discredit each other atevery chance—both were passed over for the Nobel Prize; Marconi received theprize for physics for his invention of radio in 1909 (after Tesla’s death in1943, his patent on radio was finally upheld by the Supreme Court, a ruling thatserved as the basis for patented radio technology in the United States).Troubled by phobias and, possibly, obsessive compulsive disorder, Tesla livedout the last ten years of his life in solitude at the Hotel New Yorker. He diedin 1943, in debt despite his numerous scientific contributions and patents.

The buzz kept the nine-year-old Nikola Tesla awake. In the morninghe filled a glass jar to brimming with the big bugs and, selecting the hardestworkers among them, glued the beetles’ thoraxes to the gear of a small motorhe’d built. The motor turned and Tesla’s heart raced, as he understood that heand his latest invention would usher in an era when humans could abandon allmanual labor. The world would now be powered by indentured insects. Lost in hisglorious scheme, Tesla did not notice another boy enter his workshop until theboy, out of jealousy or perhaps simple hunger, dipped his hand into the glassstorage jar, pulled out a fistful of bugs and enjoyed a leggy snack. Nikolavomited in the bushes, and insects remain an uncolonized species to this day.But the idea of harnessing natural energy and a penchant for crafting nearlymagical devices would always stay with the young inventor. Set back from the intersection of Thirty-fourth Street and Eighth Avenue in NewYork City there’s a plaque, lonely in the gathering noise, easily escapingnotice. It is a wallflower placed so awkwardly high off the street that it isdifficult to read.“HERE DIED,” the plaque begins, “THE GREAT YUGOSLAV-AMERICAN,SCIENTIST-INVENTOR, NIKOLA TESLA.” Those two hyphens had to be cast in bronze inorder to carry all that they leave unsaid. Still, they are a place to beginremembering this most forgotten man.Quickly, Nikola Tesla is responsible for our modern electricalsystem—alternating current. He was an inventor, an engineer, a scientist andoddball. It was Tesla, not Marconi, who invented radio. Though history bookstend to forget it, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a gavel drop that no one heard,upheld Tesla’s patent a few months after his death. Yet nearly everyone passingbelow this quiet plaque has no idea who Tesla was. All the Nikola Tesla HighSchools that should pepper America are still figments. In truth, fairly fewthings bear his name. There is the international unit of magnetic flux density,the tesla, most often used by MRI technicians. It is a nice tribute but it is nowatt, no volt.Great masses of people pass below the plaque never knowing that Tesla lived mostof his life alone in New York City hotel rooms. They don’t know that he believedhe was married to a pigeon or that he was friends with Mark Twain. And theydon’t know that, more than any one man, Nikola Tesla is responsible for thetwentieth century. When I first encountered My Inventions it was as an implausible work titled TheStrange Life of Nikola Tesla. I dismissed the text as an invention itself, oneconcocted by a flamboyantly imaginative fan of Tesla’s—a fairly common species.Sentences like “When I drop little squares of paper in a dish filled withliquid, I always sense a peculiar and awful taste in my mouth” convinced me thatThe Strange Life of Nikola Tesla was some sort of hoax. The story it told wastoo weird to be his. An engineering genius could never have drafted such amagnificently unscientific text—one that sometimes reads as if it has beenwritten by a carnival barker. “And now I will tell of one of my feats with thisantique implement of war which will strain to the utmost the credulity of thereader.” Indeed.But The Strange Life of Nikola Tesla was not a fabrication. Though that titlehad been added after his death, the text was in fact Tesla’s work, firstpublished serially in 1919 in The Electrical Experimenter magazine under thetitle “My Inventions.” These essays tell the story of his early life, the rotarymagnetic field, the Tesla coil and transformer. Each installment is a wondroushybrid: part autobiography, part science, part ars poetica filled with earnestconfessions and self-examinations frank as a child’s. Stories of his boyhoodcunning in catching rats, dueling with cornstalks, or attempting to fly off abarn roof mingle with sentences like “It is a resonant transformer with asecondary in which the parts, charged to a high potential, are of considerablearea and arranged in space along ideal enveloping surfaces of very large radiiof curvature, and at proper distances from one another thereby insuring a smallelectric surface density everywhere so that no leak can occur even if theconductor is bare.” One paragraph alone traipses through clockworks, guns, andSerbian poetry. Tesla was a true liberal artist; his intelligence wasunspecialized; his genius general. Voltaire exists alongside voltage.Engineering is poetry, as Tesla would broker no separation between art andscience.Perhaps because of this his writing can read like a work of science fiction:I may mention that only recently an odd looking gentleman called on me with theobject of enlisting my services in the construction of world transmitters insome distant land. “We have no money,” he said, “but carloads of solid gold andwe will give you a liberal amount.” I told him that I wanted to see first whatwill be done with my inventions in America, and this ended the interview. But Iam satisfied that some dark forces are at work.The story he makes of his life and ideas is so engaging that it is hard not toask, Is this real? And then, Does it matter? Tesla was, after all, an inventor,and we would never deign to question the reality of one of his patents.When originally published in the pages of The Electrical Experimenter, “MyInventions” mingled with an astonishing variety of colorful articles: “Soldiers’Ills Cured by Electricity,” “Will Man Freeze the Earth to Death?”, “Women NowTrained as Meter Maids,” “Wood Finishing for the Amateur,” and “Home Experimentsin Radio-Activity.” One Electrical Experimenter editorial states, “Conditions onMars we know by direct observation as well as deduction are favorable for life,and we may be certain that it exists there.” Advertisements urge the reader to“Humanize Your Talking Machine” or find the cure for all ills with Violet-Rays.There’s an ad for a nose corset alongside one where Lionel Strongfort and hisfitness regimen counsel, “Don’t commit a crime against the woman you love.”Curiosity, self-reliance, and naïveté were alive and well in 1919. “MyInventions” and the other essays included in this volume, like the back pages ofa comic book, are full of the incredulous. Wonder abounds. No cynics allowed.Tesla’s world is long gone. The distance between then and now creates a gorgeousatmospheric haze. When he presents the past’s notion of the future, it is hardnot to mark how near or far off his predictions landed. There is a sense ofnostalgia for a time that has not yet materialized and maybe never will: thefuture as Tesla imagined it, a place where machines save us all, meals are takenas efficient tiny pills, power and energy travel wirelessly around the globe,and world peace is a given.The Electrical Experimenter, a technical science monthly that would later beabsorbed into Popular Mechanics, was edited by a man named Hugo Gernsback, whofelt that any “real electrical experimenter, worthy of the name” would, ofcourse, be devising a plan for the future. And so Tesla was. Always. Since theonly limits in his laboratory were financial, he was happy to entertain thepossible, even when ridiculed. Can we speak to beings in outer space? Can wephotograph thought or build a stationary ring around the equator? Why don’t wetry?When measured against the cynicism of the twenty-first century and thecorporate, governmental, and academic controls now placed on science, Tesla’sopen mind and laboratory seem like rarities. Consider the number of painters andwriters, playwrights and performance artists all working on masterpieces today,all of them dealing with mystery and possibility. But where is the youngscientist among them who toils in her garage, trying to mix her DNA with a greatblue heron’s? Somewhere between Tesla and now, invention has lost itsillicitness. Somewhere art and science have parted ways, leaving the world towonder where Tesla’s descendants, all the poet-inventors, are hiding.In his youth Tesla studied with a staggering appetite, memorizing Faust whilecompulsively observing the physical environment around him. His father,concerned about his son’s health, forbade him the use of candles so that he’dnot be able to read. Tesla fashioned his own candles and kept on reading. Hestudied himself into a number of illnesses and nervous conditions, including anobsession with germs and the number three. In the latter half of the nineteenthcentury, there was so much that needed inventing. What pressure Tesla must havefelt as a young man, convinced that he could fashion the most efficient motorfor an electrical generator, certain he could build a tower that wouldwirelessly transmit not only information but power. His passion was a danger tohis health. While hoping to solve the problem of alternating current, he lefthimself open and entirely vulnerable.Having always enjoyed highly keen senses, in 1881 Tesla was deluged. He writesthat he “could hear the ticking of a watch with three rooms between me and thetime-piece. A fly alighting on a table in the room would cause a dull thud in myear. A carriage passing at a distance of a few miles fairly shook my wholebody.” These waves of raw sensitivity proved to be the labor pains of our modernelectrical system. In the throes of this condition, he thought of a solution. Hesaw his alternating current motor whirling in the air before his eyes and wascertain, without even building it, that it would work.Tesla soon left for the United States with dreams of fabricating his motor. Hisjourney, as he tells it, was a series of unbelievable events. Though he wasrobbed while traveling to the port, he did not turn back. He arrived on Americanshores with four centimes in his pocket. Strolling from Castle Clinton, NewYork’s early immigration center, north to Edison’s laboratory, he encountered aman cursing a broken machine on the street. Tesla swiftly fixed the gadget andthe man paid him twenty dollars, an implausible sum for 1884. When Tesla arrivedat Edison’s lab, he was immediately hired by the great inventor—that veryday—repairing dynamos and increasing efficiency in the leaky lab. Edisonpromised to pay Tesla fifty thousand dollars once the job was done. Tesla toiledfor months, arriving at ten in the morning and working until five the followingmorning, going without sleep. When he was finished, Tesla went to collect hispay. Edison began to laugh, claiming that Tesla did not understand the Americansense of humor. He refused to pay the fifty thousand dollars. Tesla’s dreaminventions crashed to the already cluttered floor. He resigned and spent thefollowing year digging ditches, the AC motor spinning in his thoughts all thewhile. It was a time of such darkness that the inventor rarely spoke of it laterin life.More than determined, he slowly climbed out of the ditch where Edison had lefthim. Tesla cobbled together space, money, and investors. While he began to seehis visions made manifest, his relationship with money would continue to becontentious, as Tesla rarely protected his patents. Like some proto–open sourceadvocate, he believed his inventions belonged to the world, not just him. It isrumored that after Marconi sent the first wireless letter S across the ocean, anengineer working for Tesla chided him, saying, “Looks like Marconi got the jumpon you.” Tesla’s answer was surprising. “Marconi is a good fellow. Let himcontinue. He is using seventeen of my patents.” The well-connected Marconi wouldgo on to win the Nobel Prize for radio, despite the solid fact that Teslainvented it. And history gets written in the strangest of ways.Meanwhile, Edison was trying his best to discredit AC. With a campaign of fear,Edison aimed to squash the burgeoning technology because he believed that hislight bulbs would not work on it. The War of the Currents roared. Edisonelectrocuted the animals of Menlo Park and built the first electric chair to beused at Sing-Sing prison in order to demonstrate AC’s dangerous properties.Instead Edison’s machine demonstrated only incompetence. The unfortunate WilliamKemmler, sentenced to die for murdering Tillie Ziegler, suffered an extendedhalf death until nearly an hour after the process had begun.The great test of Tesla’s alternating current motor came at the 1893 ChicagoWorld’s Columbian Exposition. Edison entered a bid to light the fair with DCpower. Tesla and George Westinghouse (Tesla had sold his patents toWestinghouse) entered a bid for AC. The fair would be the first time manyAmericans would experience the delights of electricity firsthand. AC, able toperform far more efficiently at a far cheaper price, won the bid handily so thatwhen President Grover Cleveland touched a golden lever, firing up Tesla’sdynamos, turning on more than 200,000 light bulbs in the White City, Americatook notice of the gangly Serbian. He and Westinghouse were awarded the contractto harness Niagara Falls and, for better or worse, the age of electricity began.The influential occultist Aleister Crowley asked us to “Please remember thatscience is majick.” The trouble Tesla would have with Crowley’s statement waswhy call it magic at all? Why not give the wonders of the world their due bylabeling them “science”? Why do we not simply believe that more is possible?With his inventions often arriving in explosive bursts of vision, it is nosurprise that Tesla had an interest in the psychical. In his 1900 essay “TheProblem of Increasing Human Energy” (included in this volume) he writes:We are all one. Metaphysical proofs are, however, not the only ones which we areable to bring forth in support of this idea. Science, too, recognizes thisconnectedness of separate individuals, though not quite in the same sense as itadmits that the suns, planets, and moons of a constellation are one body, andthere can be no doubt that it will be experimentally confirmed in times to come,when our means and methods for investigating psychical and other states andphenomena shall have been brought to great perfection.This furthers an idea from his lecture “The Action of the Eye” (also included inthis volume), where he contemplates mind reading in terms both scientific andpoetic. Though he makes some egregious statements about eye luminosity equalingcreativity, his question stands: if thought is electrical, why can’t we recordit and measure it?From all that seems beautiful and strange in Tesla’s writings, there is a themethat emerges: science versus the supernatural. Extraordinary things happened toTesla because he had extraordinary powers of observation. The supernatural issuper, yes, but more important, it is natural.Tesla’s open mind sometimes lands him in trouble as his legacy often getsclaimed by a lunatic fringe. This does little to aid his assimilation intohistory books. One biography, queerly printed in Kelly green ink, asserts,“Nikola Tesla was not an Earth man. The space people have stated that a malechild was born on board a space ship which was on a flight from Venus to theEarth in July, 1856. The little boy was called Nikola.”Poor Tesla. I suppose it is a compliment to believe he is so far above us thathe comes from Venus, but why not instead insist that such brilliance is human?While Tesla might have been the darling of the Chicago fair, the new century wasnot kind to him. Westinghouse, facing pressure from J. P. Morgan, had askedTesla to tear up their contract, the one that gave Tesla a percentage of everyhorsepower of AC-generated electricity ever sold. Westinghouse claimed thatalternating current would not survive the crucible of Morgan’s capitalism withTesla’s contract in place. So Tesla, in order to see his invention live, tore upthe contract.He spent the last ten years of his life at the Hotel New Yorker. When it openedin 1930 it was the tallest building in New York City, a monument to the ambitionand decadence of the Jazz Age. At forty-three stories high, it had its own powergenerator. The kitchen was an entire acre. There were five restaurants, tenprivate dining rooms, two ballrooms, and an indoor ice skating rink. Conveyorbelts whisked dirty dishes through secret passageways down to fully automateddishwashers. Four stories below ground, bed sheets and tablecloths weremiraculously laundered, dried, ironed, and folded without ever touching a humanhand. Everything about the hotel was efficient, futuristic. It was perfect forTesla—except that by the time he arrived at the New Yorker in 1933, he wasdestitute.I check myself into the hotel. I request his room, 3327, and am twice surprised.First, little marks the room as his and, second, the chamber is quite modest. Itake a bath in what was once his tub, trying to soak up his materiality. NikolaTesla sat alone in this room for ten years. He opened this door, breathed thisair, saw this view. He walked all over the island of Manhattan. The hotel humswith power and yet I don’t find him there. Instead, I find the same question.Why has he been so forgotten?Perhaps Tesla’s ideas were too terrific, too far before his time. He tinkeredwith a number of dreamily ingenious schemes, some realized, some still dreams:to control objects remotely, light the oceans, photograph thoughts, communicatewith life in outer space, harvest free energy from the Earth’s atmosphere,control the weather with electricity, build a ring around the equator that, byremaining stationary while the planet rotates, would make it possible to travelaround the entire world in one day. He was an environmentalist in the age ofrobber barons. “It is our duty to coming generations to leave this store ofenergy intact for them, or at least not touch it until we have perfectedprocesses for burning coal more efficiently.” (“The Problem of Increasing HumanEnergy”) Tesla, who died two years before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, spokefrequently of his plans to build a death ray that, in presenting the threat ofour total annihilation, would guarantee world peace. Innocently he writes, “Noteven the most war-crazed power ever would venture such an immeasurable andunpardonable outrage against mankind, involving as it would the burning ofhelpless women and children and noncombatants.” (“Tesla Would Pour Lightning . ..”)He goes on to write that rather than holding peace through the stasis of fear,his wireless technology would expose our undeniable connections and assure areal peace.If we were to release the energy of atoms or discover some other way ofdeveloping cheap and unlimited power at any point of the globe thisaccomplishment, instead of being a blessing, might bring disaster to mankind ingiving rise to dissension and anarchy which would ultimately result in theenthronement of the hated regime of force. The greatest good will comes fromtechnical improvements tending to unification and harmony, and my wirelesstransmitter is preeminently such. By its means the human voice and likeness willbe reproduced everywhere.Xenophobia certainly plays a role in Tesla’s having been forgotten in America.Edison once, unable to locate Smiljan on a map, asked him in all sincerity if hehad ever eaten human flesh. It was difficult for a vanilla American public,reeling from war, to lionize a foreign eccentric, an eternal bachelor whose bestfriends were the pigeons of Bryant Park. Edison, the master marketer, released“The Edison Polka,” a tune commissioned to sell his phonographs. He gave thepeople something to dance to while Tesla, with talk of death rays, lightningbolts, and extraterrestrials, gave a war-weary nation the creeps.And so his feelings toward humans are understandably complicated. Though he washappy to house the sickliest of New York’s pigeons, he couldn’t bear the touchof human hair or the sight of a woman wearing pearl earrings. He believed thatinventors, to stay true to their calling, should never marry. His life wasmarked by a series of episodes where trust was betrayed. It is no wonder heretreated to the solitude of his hotel room, studying humankind from afar.He had few friends and was often torn, feeling both wonder and disgust towardother people. In “The Problem of Increasing Human Energy” he reduces humans tothe phrase “units of higher value.” Tesla is a paradox. While guilty of writing,“When I am all but used up I simply do as the darkies, who ‘naturally fallasleep while white folks worry,’ ” he also states: “Peace can only come as anatural consequence of universal enlightenment and merging of races, and we arestill far from this blissful realization.” For all his love of humanity, itseems Tesla did not much care for humans.In 1915, a New York Times reporter phoned Tesla to inform him that he and Edisonwere to share that year’s Nobel Prize. Tesla was concerned about splitting theaward with his rival, but he so clearly deserved the prize that his initialfears never could have presaged what was to come next. The report was erroneous.The 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics went to Sir William Henry Bragg and WilliamLawrence Bragg “for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by meansof X-rays.” Tesla was never recognized by the Nobel committee.I am unwilling to accord to some smallminded and jealous individuals thesatisfaction of having thwarted my efforts. These men are to me nothing morethan microbes of a nasty disease. My project was retarded by laws of nature. Theworld was not prepared for it. It was too far ahead of time. But the same lawswill prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success.When he was a boy, Tesla climbed to the top of a barn and, holding on to nothingmore than an umbrella, jumped off. Did he fly? No. But he demonstrated an epicfearlessness in the face of failure. Tesla tried the impossible. Sometimes hefailed. Sometimes he didn’t.Darkness makes me think of Tesla, particularly that specific pain experiencedwhen a blackout brings our rolling, connected world to a disconnected halt.In Tesla’s honor I try to write this in the dark, working in rooms withoutlights or heat, without a computer. Every misstep I make casts me back furtherin time, closer to Tesla and the world he experienced as a young man. If I sitlike this long enough, I’ll start to forget what I now know too well so thatnext time I’m well lit and warm, all marvel and magnificence will be restored tothe technology I take for granted. I’ll be flush with awe again each time myfingertip brushes a light switch. Perhaps then I’ll be able to conjure a darkNew York City, 1884, the day he stepped off the SS Saturnia.Eventually I have to turn on the light. This simple gesture doesn’t quite bringthe flood of renewed disbelief and awe I’d hoped. But it does have me wonderingagain what electricity is exactly. Not even Tesla could say. “The day when weshall know exactly what ‘electricity’ is will chronicle an event probablygreater and more important than any other recorded in the history of humanrace.” (“The Action of the Eye”)My house is filled with tiny lights. At night red, green, and white flashes glowfrom the modem, the cell phone charger, the wireless baby monitor, the computer,coffeemaker, DVD player, even the switch on the surge protector. And there is ageneral hum, a sound I’ve grown so accustomed to. It is the sound of a housealive and breathing.Outside my window there is a conjunction of power lines. I follow the route ofthese wires as far as my eye can. I close my eyes and follow it even farther,making a road back to him, wirelessly. The road passes through the Hotel NewYorker and the Waldorf. It passes through the Saturnia, which took weeks to getto America. Men in suits, men in hats. Soon the road is so long it becomes ablack and white road, a road before color. A road without tarmac or cars orpower lines that goes all the way back to the tiny village of Smiljan, Croatia,where a Serbian boy was born at the stroke of midnight to a minister and hiswife. There on the road is a tall and handsome man: Nikola Tesla, inventor. Helooks up, surprised after so many years to be recognized.Only thru annihilation of distance in every respect, as the conveyance ofintelligence, transport of passengers and supplies and transmission of energywill conditions be brought about some day, insuring permanency of friendlyrelations. What we now want most is closer contact and better understandingbetween individuals and communities all over the earth.Perhaps the best way to restore this great man to Earth, to us, is to read theworld as he wrote it. Even if that world is still a long way off.SAMANTHA HUNT"},{"pageContent":"A Note on the TextThis edition of My Inventions reprints the original, authoritative text, asfirst serialized in The Electrical Experimenter magazine.

It is themost important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is thecomplete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forcesof nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who isoften misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in thepleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of thatexceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long agoperished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements.Speaking for myself, I have already had more than my full measure of thisexquisite enjoyment, so much that for many years my life was little short ofcontinuous rapture. I am credited with being one of the hardest workers andperhaps I am, if thought is the equivalent of labor, for I have devoted to italmost all of my waking hours. But if work is interpreted to be a definiteperformance in a specified time according to a rigid rule, then I may be theworst of idlers. Every effort under compulsion demands a sacrifice oflife-energy. I never paid such a price. On the contrary, I have thrived on mythoughts.In attempting to give a connected and faithful account of my activities in thisseries of articles which will be presented with the assistance of the Editors ofthe ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER and are chiefly addrest to our young men readers, Imust dwell, however reluctantly, on the impressions of my youth and thecircumstances and events which have been instrumental in determining my career.Our first endeavors are purely instinctive, promptings of an imagination vividand undisciplined. As we grow older reason asserts itself and we become more andmore systematic and designing. But those early impulses, tho not immediatelyproductive, are of the greatest moment and may shape our very destinies. Indeed,I feel now that had I understood and cultivated instead of suppressing them, Iwould have added substantial value to my bequest to the world. But not until Ihad attained manhood did I realize that I was an inventor.This was due to a number of causes. In the first place I had a brother who wasgifted to an extraordinary degree—one of those rare phenomena of mentality whichbiological investigation has failed to explain. His premature death left myparents disconsolate. We owned a horse which had been presented to us by a dearfriend. It was a magnificent animal of Arabian breed, possest of almost humanintelligence, and was cared for and petted by the whole family, having on oneoccasion saved my father’s life under remarkable circumstances. My father hadbeen called one winter night to perform an urgent duty and while crossing themountains, infested by wolves, the horse became frightened and ran away,throwing him violently to the ground. It arrived home bleeding and exhausted,but after the alarm was sounded immediately dashed off again, returning to thespot, and before the searching party were far on the way they were met by myfather, who had recovered consciousness and remounted, not realizing that he hadbeen lying in the snow for several hours. This horse was responsible for mybrother’s injuries from which he died. I witnest the tragic scene and althofifty-six years have elapsed since, my visual impression of it has lost none ofits force. The recollection of his attainments made every effort of mine seemdull in comparison.Anything I did that was creditable merely caused my parents to feel their lossmore keenly. So I grew up with little confidence in myself. But I was far frombeing considered a stupid boy, if I am to judge from an incident of which I havestill a strong remembrance. One day the Aldermen were passing thru a streetwhere I was at play with other boys. The oldest of these venerable gentlemen—awealthy citizen—paused to give a silver piece to each of us. Coming to me hesuddenly stopt and commanded, “Look in my eyes.” I met his gaze, my handoutstretched to receive the much valued coin, when, to my dismay, he said, “No,not much, you can get nothing from me, you are too smart.” They used to tell afunny story about me. I had two old aunts with wrinkled faces, one of themhaving two teeth protruding like the tusks of an elephant which she buried in mycheek every time she kist me. Nothing would scare me more than the prospect ofbeing hugged by these as affectionate as unattractive relatives. It happenedthat while being carried in my mother’s arms they asked me who was the prettierof the two. After examining their faces intently, I answered thoughtfully,pointing to one of them, “This here is not as ugly as the other.”Then again, I was intended from my very birth for the clerical profession andthis thought constantly opprest me. I longed to be an engineer but my father wasinflexible. He was the son of an officer who served in the army of the GreatNapoleon and, in common with his brother, professor of mathematics in aprominent institution, had received a military education but, singularly enough,later embraced the clergy in which vocation he achieved eminence. He was a veryerudite man, a veritable natural philosopher, poet and writer and his sermonswere said to be as eloquent as those of Abraham a Sancta-Clara. He had aprodigious memory and frequently recited at length from works in severallanguages. He often remarked playfully that if some of the classics were lost hecould restore them. His style of writing was much admired. He penned sentencesshort and terse and was full of wit and satire. The humorous remarks he madewere always peculiar and characteristic. Just to illustrate, I may mention oneor two instances. Among the help there was a cross-eyed man called Mane,employed to do work around the farm. He was chopping wood one day. As he swungthe axe my father, who stood nearby and felt very uncomfortable, cautioned him,“For God’s sake, Mane, do not strike at what you are looking but at what youintend to hit.” On another occasion he was taking out for a drive a friend whocarelessly permitted his costly fur coat to rub on the carriage wheel. My fatherreminded him of it saying, “Pull in your coat, you are ruining my tire.” He hadthe odd habit of talking to himself and would often carry on an animatedconversation and indulge in heated argument, changing the tone of his voice. Acasual listener might have sworn that several people were in the room.Altho I must trace to my mother’s influence whatever inventiveness I possess,the training he gave me must have been helpful. It comprised all sorts ofexercises—as, guessing one another’s thoughts, discovering the defects of someform or expression, repeating long sentences or performing mental calculations.These daily lessons were intended to strengthen memory and reason and especiallyto develop the critical sense, and were undoubtedly very beneficial.My mother descended from one of the oldest families in the country and a line ofinventors. Both her father and grandfather originated numerous implements forhousehold, agricultural and other uses. She was a truly great woman, of rareskill, courage and fortitude, who had braved the storms of life and past thrumany a trying experience. When she was sixteen a virulent pestilence swept thecountry. Her father was called away to administer the last sacraments to thedying and during his absence she went alone to the assistance of a neighboringfamily who were stricken by the dread disease. All of the members, five innumber, succumbed in rapid succession. She bathed, clothed and laid out thebodies, decorating them with flowers according to the custom of the country andwhen her father returned he found everything ready for a Christian burial. Mymother was an inventor of the first order and would, I believe, have achievedgreat things had she not been so remote from modern life and its multifoldopportunities. She invented and constructed all kinds of tools and devices andwove the finest designs from thread which was spun by her. She even planted theseeds, raised the plants and separated the fibers herself. She workedindefatigably, from break of day till late at night, and most of the wearingapparel and furnishings of the home was the product of her hands. When she waspast sixty, her fingers were still nimble enough to tie three knots in aneyelash.There was another and still more important reason for my late awakening. In myboyhood I suffered from a peculiar affliction due to the appearance of images,often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which marred the sight of realobjects and interfered with my thought and action. They were pictures of thingsand scenes which I had really seen, never of those I imagined. When a word wasspoken to me the image of the object it designated would present itself vividlyto my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whether what I sawwas tangible or not. This caused me great discomfort and anxiety. None of thestudents of psychology or physiology whom I have consulted could ever explainsatisfactorily these phenomena. They seem to have been unique altho I wasprobably predisposed as I know that my brother experienced a similar trouble.The theory I have formulated is that the images were the result of a reflexaction from the brain on the retina under great excitation. They certainly werenot hallucinations such as are produced in diseased and anguished minds, for inother respects I was normal and composed. To give an idea of my distress,suppose that I had witnest a funeral or some such nerve-racking spectacle. Then,inevitably, in the stillness of night, a vivid picture of the scene would thrustitself before my eyes and persist despite all my efforts to banish it. Sometimesit would even remain fixt in space tho I pushed my hand thru it. If myexplanation is correct, it should be possible to project on a screen the imageof any object one conceives and make it visible. Such an advance wouldrevolutionize all human relations. I am convinced that this wonder can and willbe accomplished in time to come; I may add that I have devoted much thought tothe solution of the problem.To free myself of these tormenting appearances, I tried to concentrate my mindon something else I had seen, and in this way I would often obtain temporaryrelief; but in order to get it I had to conjure continuously new images. It wasnot long before I found that I had exhausted all of those at my command; my“reel” had run out, as it were, because I had seen little of the world—onlyobjects in my home and the immediate surroundings. As I performed these mentaloperations for the second or third time, in order to chase the appearances frommy vision, the remedy gradually lost all its force. Then I instinctivelycommenced to make excursions beyond the limits of the small world of which I hadknowledge, and I saw new scenes. These were at first very blurred andindistinct, and would flit away when I tried to concentrate my attention uponthem, but by and by I succeeded in fixing them; they gained in strength anddistinctness and finally assumed the concreteness of real things. I soondiscovered that my best comfort was attained if I simply went on in my visionfarther and farther, getting new impressions all the time, and so I began totravel—of course, in my mind. Every night (and sometimes during the day), whenalone, I would start on my journeys—see new places, cities and countries—livethere, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances and, howeverunbelievable, it is a fact that they were just as dear to me as those in actuallife and not a bit less intense in their manifestations.This I did constantly until I was about seventeen when my thoughts turnedseriously to invention. Then I observed to my delight that I could visualizewith the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I couldpicture them all as real in my mind. Thus I have been led unconsciously toevolve what I consider a new method of materializing inventive concepts andideas, which is radically opposite to the purely experimental and is in myopinion ever so much more expeditious and efficient. The moment one constructs adevice to carry into practise a crude idea he finds himself unavoidably engrostwith the details and defects of the apparatus. As he goes on improving andreconstructing, his force of concentration diminishes and he loses sight of thegreat underlying principle. Results may be obtained but always at the sacrificeof quality.My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get an idea Istart at once building it up in my imagination. I change the construction, makeimprovements and operate the device in my mind. It is absolutely immaterial tome whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop. I even note if itis out of balance. There is no difference whatever, the results are the same. Inthis way I am able to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touchinganything. When I have gone so far as to embody in the invention every possibleimprovement I can think of and see no fault anywhere, I put into concrete formthis final product of my brain. Invariably my device works as I conceived thatit should, and the experiment comes out exactly as I planned it. In twenty yearsthere has not been a single exception. Why should it be otherwise? Engineering,electrical and mechanical, is positive in results. There is scarcely a subjectthat cannot be mathematically treated and the effects calculated or the resultsdetermined beforehand from the available theoretical and practical data. Thecarrying out into practise of a crude idea as is being generally done is, Ihold, nothing but a waste of energy, money and time.My early affliction had, however, another compensation. The incessant mentalexertion developed my powers of observation and enabled me to discover a truthof great importance. I had noted that the appearance of images was alwayspreceded by actual vision of scenes under peculiar and generally veryexceptional conditions and I was impelled on each occasion to locate theoriginal impulse. After a while this effort grew to be almost automatic and Igained great facility in connecting cause and effect. Soon I became aware, to mysurprise, that every thought I conceived was suggested by an externalimpression. Not only this but all my actions were prompted in a similar way. Inthe course of time it became perfectly evident to me that I was merely anautomaton endowed with power of movement, responding to the stimuli of the senseorgans and thinking and acting accordingly. The practical result of this was theart of telautomatics which has been so far carried out only in an imperfectmanner. Its latent possibilities will, however, be eventually shown. I have beensince years planning self-controlled automata and believe that mechanisms can beproduced which will act as if possest of reason, to a limited degree, and willcreate a revolution in many commercial and industrial departments.I was about twelve years old when I first succeeded in banishing an image frommy vision by wilful effort, but I never had any control over the flashes oflight to which I have referred. They were, perhaps, my strangest experience andinexplicable. They usually occurred when I found myself in a dangerous ordistressing situation or when I was greatly exhilarated. In some instances Ihave seen all the air around me filled with tongues of living flame. Theirintensity, instead of diminishing, increased with time and seemingly attained amaximum when I was about twenty-five years old. While in Paris, in 1883, aprominent French manufacturer sent me an invitation to a shooting expeditionwhich I accepted. I had been long confined to the factory and the fresh air hada wonderfully invigorating effect on me. On my return to the city that night Ifelt a positive sensation that my brain had caught fire. I saw a light as tho asmall sun was located in it and I past the whole night applying coldcompressions to my tortured head. Finally the flashes diminished in frequencyand force but it took more than three weeks before they wholly subsided. When asecond invitation was extended to me my answer was an emphatic NO!These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time, as when anew idea opening up possibilities strikes me, but they are no longer exciting,being of relatively small intensity. When I close my eyes I invariably observefirst, a background of very dark and uniform blue, not unlike the sky on a clearbut starless night. In a few seconds this field becomes animated withinnumerable scintillating flakes of green, arranged in several layers andadvancing towards me. Then there appears, to the right, a beautiful pattern oftwo systems of parallel and closely spaced lines, at right angles to oneanother, in all sorts of colors with yellow-green and gold predominating.Immediately thereafter the lines grow brighter and the whole is thicklysprinkled with dots of twinkling light. This picture moves slowly across thefield of vision and in about ten seconds vanishes to the left, leaving behind aground of rather unpleasant and inert grey which quickly gives way to a billowysea of clouds, seemingly trying to mould themselves in living shapes. It iscurious that I cannot project a form into this grey until the second phase isreached. Every time, before falling asleep, images of persons or objects flitbefore my view. When I see them I know that I am about to lose consciousness. Ifthey are absent and refuse to come it means a sleepless night.To what an extent imagination played a part in my early life I may illustrate byanother odd experience. Like most children I was fond of jumping and developedan intense desire to support myself in the air. Occasionally a strong windrichly charged with oxygen blew from the mountains rendering my body as light ascork and then I would leap and float in space for a long time. It was adelightful sensation and my disappointment was keen when later I undeceivedmyself.During that period I contracted many strange likes, dislikes and habits, some ofwhich I can trace to external impressions while others are unaccountable. I hada violent aversion against the earrings of women but other ornaments, asbracelets, pleased me more or less according to design. The sight of a pearlwould almost give me a fit but I was fascinated with the glitter of crystals orobjects with sharp edges and plane surfaces. I would not touch the hair of otherpeople except, perhaps, at the point of a revolver. I would get a fever bylooking at a peach and if a piece of camphor was anywhere in the house it causedme the keenest discomfort. Even now I am not insensible to some of theseupsetting impulses. When I drop little squares of paper in a dish filled withliquid, I always sense a peculiar and awful taste in my mouth. I counted thesteps in my walks and calculated the cubical contents of soup plates, coffeecups and pieces of food,—otherwise my meal was unenjoyable. All repeated acts oroperations I performed had to be divisible by three and if I mist I feltimpelled to do it all over again, even if it took hours.Up to the age of eight years, my character was weak and vacillating. I hadneither courage or strength to form a firm resolve. My feelings came in wavesand surges and vibrated unceasingly between extremes. My wishes were ofconsuming force and like the heads of the hydra, they multiplied. I was opprestby thoughts of pain in life and death and religious fear. I was swayed bysuperstitious belief and lived in constant dread of the spirit of evil, ofghosts and ogres and other unholy monsters of the dark. Then, all at once, therecame a tremendous change which altered the course of my whole existence.Of all things I liked books the best. My father had a large library and wheneverI could manage I tried to satisfy my passion for reading. He did not permit itand would fly into a rage when he caught me in the act. He hid the candles whenhe found that I was reading in secret. He did not want me to spoil my eyes. ButI obtained tallow, made the wicking and cast the sticks into tin forms, andevery night I would bush the keyhole and the cracks and read, often till dawn,when all others slept and my mother started on her arduous daily task. On oneoccasion I came across a novel entitled “Abafi” (the Son of Aba), a Serbiantranslation of a well known Hungarian writer, Josika. This work somehow awakenedmy dormant powers of will and I began to practise self-control. At first myresolutions faded like snow in April, but in a little while I conquered myweakness and felt a pleasure I never knew before—that of doing as I willed. Inthe course of time this vigorous mental exercise became second nature. At theoutset my wishes had to be subdued but gradually desire and will grew to beidentical. After years of such discipline I gained so complete a mastery overmyself that I toyed with passions which have meant destruction to some of thestrongest men. At a certain age I contracted a mania for gambling which greatlyworried my parents. To sit down to a game of cards was for me the quintessenceof pleasure. My father led an exemplary life and could not excuse the senselesswaste of time and money in which I indulged. I had a strong resolve but myphilosophy was bad. I would say to him, “I can stop whenever I please but is itworth while to give up that which I would purchase with the joys of Paradise?”On frequent occasions he gave vent to his anger and contempt but my mother wasdifferent. She understood the character of men and knew that one’s salvationcould only be brought about thru his own efforts. One afternoon, I remember,when I had lost all my money and was craving for a game, she came to me with aroll of bills and said, “Go and enjoy yourself. The sooner you lose all wepossess the better it will be. I know that you will get over it.” She was right.I conquered my passion then and there and only regretted that it had not been ahundred times as strong. I not only vanquished but tore it from my heart so asnot to leave even a trace of desire. Ever since that time I have been asindifferent to any form of gambling as to picking teeth.During another period I smoked excessively, threatening to ruin my health. Thenmy will asserted itself and I not only stopt but destroyed all inclination. Longago I suftered from heart trouble until I discovered that it was due to theinnocent cup of coffee I consumed every morning. I discontinued at once, tho Iconfess it was not an easy task. In this way I checked and bridled other habitsand passions and have not only preserved my life but derived an immense amountof satisfaction from what most men would consider privation and sacrifice.After finishing the studies at the Polytechnic Institute and University I had acomplete nervous breakdown and while the malady lasted I observed many phenomenastrange and unbelievable."},{"pageContent":"PART IIMY FIRST EFFORTS IN INVENTIONSI shall dwell briefly on these extraordinary experiences, on account of theirpossible interest to students of psychology and physiology and also because thisperiod of agony was of the greatest consequence on my mental development andsubsequent labors. But it is indispensable to first relate the circumstances andconditions which preceded them and in which might be found their partialexplanation.From childhood I was compelled to concentrate attention upon myself. This causedme much suffering but, to my present view, it was a blessing in disguise for ithas taught me to appreciate the inestimable value of introspection in thepreservation of life, as well as a means of achievement. The pressure ofoccupation and the incessant stream of impressions pouring into ourconsciousness thru all the gateways of knowledge make modern existence hazardousin many ways. Most persons are so absorbed in the contemplation of the outsideworld that they are wholly oblivious to what is passing on within themselves.The premature death of millions is primarily traceable to this cause. Even amongthose who exercise care it is a common mistake to avoid imaginary, and ignorethe real dangers. And what is true of an individual also applies, more or less,to a people as a whole. Witness, in illustration, the prohibition movement. Adrastic, if not unconstitutional, measure is now being put thru in this countryto prevent the consumption of alcohol and yet it is a positive fact that coffee,tea, tobacco, chewing gum and other stimulants, which are freely indulged ineven at the tender age, are vastly more injurious to the national body, judgingfrom the number of those who succumb. So, for instance, during my student yearsI gathered from the published necrologues in Vienna, the home of coffeedrinkers, that deaths from heart trouble sometimes reached sixty-seven per centof the total. Similar observations might probably be made in cities where theconsumption of tea is excessive. These delicious beverages super-excite andgradually exhaust the fine fibers of the brain. They also interefere seriouslywith arterial circulation and should be enjoyed all the more sparingly as theirdeleterious effects are slow and imperceptible. Tobacco, on the other hand, isconducive to easy and pleasant thinking and detracts from the intensity andconcentration necessary to all original and vigorous effort of the intellect.Chewing gum is helpful for a short while but soon drains the glandular systemand inflicts irreparable damage, not to speak of the revulsion it creates.Alcohol in small quantities is an excellent tonic, but is toxic in its actionwhen absorbed in larger amounts, quite immaterial as to whether it is taken inas whiskey or produced in the stomach from sugar. But it should not beoverlooked that all these are great eliminators assisting Nature, as they do, inupholding her stern but just law of the survival of the fittest. Eager reformersshould also be mindful of the eternal perversity of mankind which makes theindifferent “laissez-faire” by far preferable to enforced restraint. The truthabout this is that we need stimulants to do our best work under present livingconditions, and that we must exercise moderation and control our appetites andinclinations in every direction. That is what I have been doing for many years,in this way maintaining myself young in body and mind. Abstinence was not alwaysto my liking but I find ample reward in the agreeable experiences I am nowmaking. Just in the hope of converting some to my precepts and convictions Iwill recall one or two.A short time ago I was returning to my hotel. It was a bitter cold night, theground slippery, and no taxi to be had. Half a block behind me followed anotherman, evidently as anxious as myself to get under cover. Suddenly my legs went upin the air. In the same instant there was a flash in my brain, the nervesresponded, the muscles contracted, I swung thru 180 degrees and landed on myhands. I resumed my walk as tho nothing had happened when the stranger caught upwith me. “How old are you?” he asked, surveying me critically. “Oh, aboutfifty-nine,” I replied. “What of it?” “Well,” said he, “I have seen a cat dothis but never a man.” About a month since I wanted to order new eyeglasses andwent to an oculist who put me thru the usual tests. He lookt at me increduouslyas I read off with ease the smallest print at considerable distance. But when Itold him that I was past sixty he gasped in astonishment. Friends of mine oftenremark that my suits fit me like gloves but they do not know that all myclothing is made to measurements which were taken nearly 35 years ago and neverchanged. During this same period my weight has not varied one pound.In this connection I may tell a funny story. One evening, in the winter of 1885,Mr. Edison, Edward H. Johnson, the President of the Edison Illuminating Company,Mr. Batchellor, Manager of the works, and myself entered a little place opposite65 Fifth Avenue where the offices of the company were located. Someone suggestedguessing weights and I was induced to step on a scale. Edison felt me all overand said: “Tesla weighs 152 lbs. to an ounce,” and he guest it exactly. Stript Iweighed 142 lbs. and that is still my weight. I whispered to Mr. Johnson: “Howis it possible that Edison could guess my weight so closely?” “Well,” he said,lowering his voice, “I will tell you, confidentially, but you must not sayanything. He was employed for a long time in a Chicago slaughter-house where heweighed thousands of hogs every day! That’s why.” My friend, the Hon. ChaunceyM. Depew, tells of an Englishman on whom he sprung one of his original anecdotesand who listened with a puzzled expression but—a year later—laughed out loud. Iwill frankly confess it took me longer than that to appreciate Johnson’s joke.Now, my well being is simply the result of a careful and measured mode of livingand perhaps the most astonishing thing is that three times in my youth I wasrendered by illness a hopeless physical wreck and given up by physicians. Morethan this, thru ignorance and lightheartedness, I got into all sorts ofdifficulties, dangers and scrapes from which I extricated myself as byenchantment. I was almost drowned a dozen times; was nearly boiled alive andjust mist being cremated. I was entombed, lost and frozen. I had hair-breadthescapes from mad dogs, hogs, and other wild animals. I past thru dreadfuldiseases and met with all kinds of odd mishaps and that I am hale and heartytoday seems like a miracle. But as I recall these incidents to my mind I feelconvinced that my preservation was not altogether accidental.An inventor’s endeavor is essentially life-saving. Whether he harnesses forces,improves devices, or provides new comforts and conveniences, he is adding to thesafety of our existence. He is also better qualified than the average individualto protect himself in peril, for he is observant and resourceful. If I had noother evidence that I was, in a measure, possest of such qualities I would findit in these personal experiences. The reader will be able to judge for himselfif I mention one or two instances. On one occasion, when about 14 years old, Iwanted to scare some friends who were bathing with me. My plan was to dive undera long floating structure and slip out quietly at the other end. Swimming anddiving came to me as naturally as to a duck and I was confident that I couldperform the feat. Accordingly I plunged into the water and, when out of view,turned around and proceeded rapidly towards the opposite side. Thinking that Iwas safely beyond the structure, I rose to the surface but to my dismay struck abeam. Of course, I quickly dived and forged ahead with rapid strokes until mybreath was beginning to give out. Rising for the second time, my head came againin contact with a beam. Now I was becoming desperate. However, summoning all myenergy, I made a third frantic attempt but the result was the same. The tortureof supprest breathing was getting unendurable, my brain was reeling and I feltmyself sinking. At that moment, when my situation seemed absolutely hopeless, Iexperienced one of those flashes of light and the structure above me appearedbefore my vision. I either discerned or guest that there was a little spacebetween the surface of the water and the boards resting on the beams and, withconsciousness nearly gone, I floated up, prest my mouth close to the planks andmanaged to inhale a little air, unfortunately mingled with a spray of waterwhich nearly choked me. Several times I repeated this procedure as in a dreamuntil my heart, which was racing at a terrible rate, quieted down and I gainedcomposure. After that I made a number of unsuccessful dives, having completelylost the sense of direction, but finally succeeded in getting out of the trapwhen my friends had already given me up and were fishing for my body.That bathing season was spoiled for me thru recklessness but I soon forgot thelesson and only two years later I fell into a worse predicament. There was alarge flour mill with a dam across the river near the city where I was studyingat that time. As a rule the height of the water was only two or three inchesabove the dam and to swim out to it was a sport not very dangerous in which Ioften indulged. One day I went alone to the river to enjoy myself as usual. WhenI was a short distance from the masonry, however, I was horrified to observethat the water had risen and was carrying me along swiftly. I tried to get awaybut it was too late. Luckily, tho, I saved myself from being swept over bytaking hold of the wall with both hands. The pressure against my chest was greatand I was barely able to keep my head above the surface. Not a soul was in sightand my voice was lost in the roar of the fall. Slowly and gradually I becameexhausted and unable to withstand the strain longer. Just as I was about to letgo, to be dashed against the rocks below, I saw in a flash of light a familiardiagram illustrating the hydraulic principle that the pressure of a fluid inmotion is proportionate to the area exposed, and automatically I turned on myleft side. As if by magic the pressure was reduced and I found it comparativelyeasy in that position to resist the force of the stream. But the danger stillconfronted me. I knew that sooner or later I would be carried down, as it wasnot possible for any help to reach me in time, even if I attracted attention. Iam ambidextrous now but then I was left-handed and had comparatively littlestrength in my right arm. For this reason I did not dare to turn on the otherside to rest and nothing remained but to slowly push my body along the dam. Ihad to get away from the mill towards which my face was turned as the currentthere was much swifter and deeper. It was a long and painful ordeal and I camenear to failing at its very end for I was confronted with a depression in themasonry. I managed to get over with the last ounce of my force and fell in aswoon when I reached the bank, where I was found. I had torn virtually all theskin from my left side and it took several weeks before the fever subsided and Iwas well. These are only two of many instances but they may be sufficient toshow that had it not been for the inventor’s instinct I would not have lived totell this tale.Interested people have often asked me how and when I began to invent. This I canonly answer from my present recollection in the light of which the first attemptI recall was rather ambitious for it involved the invention of an apparatus anda method. In the former I was anticipated but the latter was original. Ithappened in this way. One of my playmates had come into the possession of a hookand fishing-tackle which created quite an excitement in the village, and thenext morning all started out to catch frogs. I was left alone and deserted owingto a quarrel with this boy. I had never seen a real hook and pictured it assomething wonderful, endowed with peculiar qualities, and was despairing not tobe one of the party. Urged by necessity, I somehow got hold of a piece of softiron wire, hammered the end to a sharp point between two stones, bent it intoshape, and fastened it to a strong string. I then cut a rod, gathered some bait,and went down to the brook where there were frogs in abundance. But I could notcatch any and was almost discouraged when it occurred to me to dangle the emptyhook in front of a frog sitting on a stump. At first he collapsed but by and byhis eyes bulged out and became bloodshot, he swelled to twice his normal sizeand made a vicious snap at the hook. Immediately I pulled him up. I tried thesame thing again and again and the method proved infallible. When my comrades,who in spite of their fine outfit had caught nothing, came to me they were greenwith envy. For a long time I kept my secret and enjoyed the monopoly but finallyyielded to the spirit of Christmas. Every boy could then do the same and thefollowing summer brought disaster to the frogs.In my next attempt I seem to have acted under the first instinctive impulsewhich later dominated me—to harness the energies of nature to the service ofman. I did this thru the medium of May-bugs—or June-bugs as they are called inAmerica—which were a veritable pest in that country and sometimes broke thebranches of trees by the sheer weight of their bodies. The bushes were blackwith them. I would attach as many as four of them to a cross-piece, rotablyarranged on a thin spindle, and transmit the motion of the same to a large discand so derive considerable “power.” These creatures were remarkably efficient,for once they were started they had no sense to stop and continued whirling forhours and hours and the hotter it was the harder they worked. All went welluntil a strange boy came to the place. He was the son of a retired officer inthe Austrian Army. That urchin ate May-bugs alive and enjoyed them as tho theywere the finest blue-point oysters. That disgusting sight terminated myendeavors in this promising field and I have never since been able to touch aMay-bug or any other insect for that matter.After that, I believe, I undertook to take apart and assemble the clocks of mygrandfather. In the former operation I was always successful but often failed inthe latter. So it came that he brought my work to a sudden halt in a manner nottoo delicate and it took thirty years before I tackled another clockwork again.Shortly thereafter I went into the manufacture of a kind of pop-gun whichcomprised a hollow tube, a piston, and two plugs of hemp. When firing the gun,the piston was prest against the stomach and the tube was pushed back quicklywith both hands. The air between the plugs was comprest and raised to hightemperature and one of them was expelled with a loud report. The art consistedin selecting a tube of the proper taper from the hollow stalks. I did very wellwith that gun but my activities interfered with the window panes in our houseand met with painful discouragement. If I remember rightly, I then took tocarving swords from pieces of furniture which I could conveniently obtain. Atthat time I was under the sway of the Serbian national poetry and full ofadmiration for the feats of the heroes. I used to spend hours in mowing down myenemies in the form of corn-stalks which ruined the crops and netted me severalspankings from my mother. Moreover these were not of the formal kind but thegenuine article.I had all this and more behind me before I was six years old and had past thruone year of elementary school in the village of Smiljan where I was born. Atthis juncture we moved to the little city of Gospic nearby. This change ofresidence was like a calamity to me. It almost broke my heart to part from ourpigeons, chickens and sheep, and our magnificent flock of geese which used torise to the clouds in the morning and return from the feeding grounds at sundownin battle formation, so perfect that it would have put a squadron of the bestaviators of the present day to shame. In our new house I was but a prisoner,watching the strange people I saw thru the window blinds. My bashfulness wassuch that I would rather have faced a roaring lion than one of the city dudeswho strolled about. But my hardest trial came on Sunday when I had to dress upand attend the service. There I met with an accident, the mere thought of whichmade my blood curdle like sour milk for years afterwards. It was my secondadventure in a church. Not long before I was entombed for a night in an oldchapel on an inaccessible mountain which was visited only once a year. It was anawful experience, but this one was worse. There was a wealthy lady in town, agood but pompous woman, who used to come to the church gorgeously painted up andattired with an enormous train and attendants. One Sunday I had just finishedringing the bell in the belfry and rushed downstairs when this grand dame wassweeping out and I jumped on her train. It tore off with a ripping noise whichsounded like a salvo of musketry fired by raw recruits. My father was livid withrage. He gave me a gentle slap on the cheek, the only corporal punishment heever administered to me but I almost feel it now. The embarrassment andconfusion that followed are indescribable. I was practically ostracised untilsomething else happened which redeemed me in the estimation of the community.An enterprising young merchant had organized a fire department. A new fireengine was purchased, uniforms provided and the men drilled for service andparade. The engine was, in reality, a pump to be worked by sixteen men and wasbeautifully painted red and black. One afternoon the official trial was preparedfor and the machine was transported to the river. The entire population turnedout to witness the great spectacle. When all the speeches and ceremonies wereconcluded, the command was given to pump, but not a drop of water came from thenozzle. The professors and experts tried in vain to locate the trouble. Thefizzle was complete when I arrived at the scene. My knowledge of the mechanismwas nil and I knew next to nothing of air pressure, but instinctively I felt forthe suction hose in the water and found that it had collapsed. When I waded inthe river and opened it up the water rushed forth and not a few Sunday clotheswere spoiled. Archimedes running naked thru the streets of Syracuse and shoutingEureka at the top of his voice did not make a greater impression than myself. Iwas carried on the shoulders and was the hero of the day.Upon settling in the city I began a four-years’ course in the so-called NormalSchool preparatory to my studies at the College or Real-Gymnasium. During thisperiod my boyish efforts and exploits, as well as troubles, continued. Amongother things I attained the unique distinction of champion crow catcher in thecountry. My method of procedure was extremely simple. I would go in the forest,hide in the bushes, and imitate the call of the bird. Usually I would getseveral answers and in a short while a crow would flutter down into theshrubbery near me. After that all I needed to do was to throw a piece ofcardboard to detract its attention, jump up and grab it before it couldextricate itself from the undergrowth. In this way I would capture as many as Idesired. But on one occasion something occurred which made me respect them. Ihad caught a fine pair of birds and was returning home with a friend. When weleft the forest, thousands of crows had gathered making a frightful racket. In afew minutes they rose in pursuit and soon enveloped us. The fun lasted until allof a sudden I received a blow on the back of my head which knocked me down. Thenthey attacked me viciously. I was compelled to release the two birds and wasglad to join my friend who had taken refuge in a cave.In the schoolroom there were a few mechanical models which interested me andturned my attention to water turbines. I constructed many of these and foundgreat pleasure in operating them. How extraordinary was my life an incident mayillustrate. My uncle had no use for this kind of pastime and more than oncerebuked me. I was fascinated by a description of Niagara Falls I had perused,and pictured in my imagination a big wheel run by the Falls. I told my unclethat I would go to America and carry out this scheme. Thirty years later I sawmy ideas carried out at Niagara and marveled at the unfathomable mystery of themind.I made all kinds of other contrivances and contraptions but among these thearbalists I produced were the best. My arrows, when shot, disappeared from sightand at close range traversed a plank of pine one inch thick. Thru the continuoustightening of the bows I developed skin on my stomach very much like that of acrocodile and I am often wondering whether it is due to this exercise that I amable even now to digest cobble-stones! Nor can I pass in silence my performanceswith the sling which would have enabled me to give a stunning exhibit at theHippodrome. And now I will tell of one of my feats with this antique implementof war which will strain to the utmost the credulity of the reader. I waspracticing while walking with my uncle along the river. The sun was setting, thetrout were playful and from time to time one would shoot up into the air, itsglistening body sharply defined against a projecting rock beyond. Of course anyboy might have hit a fish under these propitious conditions but I undertook amuch more difficult task and I foretold to my uncle, to the minutest detail,what I intended doing. I was to hurl a stone to meet the fish, press its bodyagainst the rock, and cut it in two. It was no sooner said than done. My unclelooked at me almost scared out of his wits and exclaimed “Vade retro Satanas!”and it was a few days before he spoke to me again. Other records, however great,will be eclipsed but I feel that I could peacefully rest on my laurels for athousand years."},{"pageContent":"PART IIIMY LATER ENDEAVORSThe Discovery ofthe Rotating Magnetic FieldAt the age of ten I entered the Real Gymnasium which was a new and fairly wellequipt institution. In the department of physics were various models ofclassical scientific apparatus, electrical and mechanical. The demonstrationsand experiments performed from time to time by the instructors fascinated me andwere undoubtedly a powerful incentive to invention. I was also passionately fondof mathematical studies and often won the professor’s praise for rapidcalculation. This was due to my acquired facility of visualizing the figures andperforming the operations, not in the usual intuitive manner, but as in actuallife. Up to a certain degree of complexity it was absolutely the same to mewhether I wrote the symbols on the board or conjured them before my mentalvision. But freehand drawing, to which many hours of the course were devoted,was an annoyance I could not endure. This was rather remarkable as most of themembers of the family excelled in it. Perhaps my aversion was simply due to thepredilection I found in undisturbed thought. Had it not been for a fewexceptionally stupid boys, who could not do anything at all, my record wouldhave been the worst. It was a serious handicap as under the then existingeducational regime, drawing being obligatory, this deficiency threatened tospoil my whole career and my father had considerable trouble in railroading mefrom one class to another.In the second year at that institution I became obsest with the idea ofproducing continuous motion thru steady air pressure. The pump incident, ofwhich I have told, had set afire my youthful imagination and imprest me with theboundless possibilities of a vacuum. I grew frantic in my desire to harness thisinexhaustible energy but for a long time I was groping in the dark. Finally,however, my endeavors crystallized in an invention which was to enable me toachieve what no other mortal ever attempted. Imagine a cylinder freely rotatableon two bearings and partly surrounded by a rectangular trough which fits itperfectly. The open side of the trough is closed by a partition so that thecylindrical segment within the enclosure divides the latter into twocompartments entirely separated from each other by air-tight sliding joints. Oneof these compartments being sealed and once for all exhausted, the otherremaining open, a perpetual rotation of the cylinder would result, at least, Ithought so. A wooden model was constructed and fitted with infinite care andwhen I applied the pump on one side and actually observed that there was atendency to turning, I was delirious with joy. Mechanical flight was the onething I wanted to accomplish altho still under the discouraging recollection ofa bad fall I sustained by jumping with an umbrella from the top of a building.Every day I used to transport myself thru the air to distant regions but couldnot understand just how I managed to do it. Now I had something concrete—aflying machine with nothing more than a rotating shaft, flapping wings, and—avacuum of unlimited power! From that time on I made my daily aërial excursionsin a vehicle of comfort and luxury as might have befitted King Solomon. It tookyears before I understood that the atmospheric pressure acted at right angles tothe surface of the cylinder and that the slight rotary effort I observed was dueto a leak. Tho this knowledge came gradually it gave me a painful shock. I hadhardly completed my course at the Real Gymnasium when I was prostrated with adangerous illness or rather, a score of them, and my condition became sodesperate that I was given up by physicians. During this period I was permittedto read constantly, obtaining books from the Public Library which had beenneglected and entrusted to me for classification of the works and preparation ofthe catalogues. One day I was handed a few volumes of new literature unlikeanything I had ever read before and so captivating as to make me utterly forgetmy hopeless state. They were the earlier works of Mark Twain and to them mighthave been due the miraculous recovery which followed. Twenty-five years later,when I met Mr. Clements and we formed a friendship between us, I told him of theexperience and was amazed to see that great man of laughter burst into tears.My studies were continued at the higher Real Gymnasium in Carlstadt, Croatia,where one of my aunts resided. She was a distinguished lady, the wife of aColonel who was an old war-horse having participated in many battles. I nevercan forget the three years I past at their home. No fortress in time of war wasunder a more rigid discipline. I was fed like a canary bird. All the meals wereof the highest quality and deliciously prepared but short in quantity by athousand percent. The slices of ham cut by my aunt were like tissue paper. Whenthe Colonel would put something substantial on my plate she would snatch it awayand say excitedly to him: “Be careful, Niko is very delicate.” I had a voraciousappetite and suffered like Tantalus. But I lived in an atmosphere of refinementand artistic taste quite unusual for those times and conditions. The land waslow and marshy and malaria fever never left me while there despite of theenormous amounts of quinin I consumed. Occasionally the river would rise anddrive an army of rats into the buildings, devouring everything even to thebundles of the fierce paprika. These pests were to me a welcome diversion. Ithinned their ranks by all sorts of means, which won me the unenviabledistinction of rat-catcher in the community. At last, however, my course wascompleted, the misery ended, and I obtained the certificate of maturity whichbrought me to the cross-roads.During all those years my parents never wavered in their resolve to make meembrace the clergy, the mere thought of which filled me with dread. I had becomeintensely interested in electricity under the stimulating influence of myProfessor of Physics, who was an ingenious man and often demonstrated theprinciples by apparatus of his own invention. Among these I recall a device inthe shape of a freely rotatable bulb, with tinfoil coatings, which was made tospin rapidly when connected to a static machine. It is impossible for me toconvey an adequate idea of the intensity of feeling I experienced in witnessinghis exhibitions of these mysterious phenomena. Every impression produced athousand echoes in my mind. I wanted to know more of this wonderful force; Ilonged for experiment and investigation and resigned myself to the inevitablewith aching heart.Just as I was making ready for the long journey home I received word that myfather wished me to go on a shooting expedition. It was a strange request as hehad been always strenuously opposed to this kind of sport. But a few days laterI learned that the cholera was raging in that district and, taking advantage ofan opportunity, I returned to Gospic in disregard of my parents’ wishes. It isincredible how absolutely ignorant people were as to the causes of this scourgewhich visited the country in intervals of from fifteen to twenty years. Theythought that the deadly agents were transmitted thru the air and filled it withpungent odors and smoke. In the meantime they drank the infected water and diedin heaps. I contracted the awful disease on the very day of my arrival and althosurviving the crisis, I was confined to bed for nine months with scarcely anyability to move. My energy was completely exhausted and for the second time Ifound myself at death’s door. In one of the sinking spells which was thought tobe the last, my father rushed into the room. I still see his pallid face as hetried to cheer me in tones belying his assurance. “Perhaps,” I said, “I may getwell if you will let me study engineering.” “You will go to the best technicalinstitution in the world.” he solemnly replied, and I knew that he meant it. Aheavy weight was lifted from my mind but the relief would have come too late hadit not been for a marvelous cure brought about thru a bitter decoction of apeculiar bean. I came to life like another Lazarus to the utter amazement ofeverybody. My father insisted that I spend a year in healthful physical outdoorexercises to which I reluctantly consented. For most of this term I roamed inthe mountains, loaded with a hunter’s outfit and a bundle of books, and thiscontact with nature made me stronger in body as well as in mind. I thought andplanned, and conceived many ideas almost as a rule delusive. The vision wasclear enough but the knowledge of principles was very limited. In one of myinventions I proposed to convey letters and packages across the seas, thru asubmarine tube, in spherical containers of sufficient strength to resist thehydraulic pressure. The pumping plant, intended to force the water thru thetube, was accurately figured and designed and all other particulars carefullyworked out. Only one trifling detail, of no consequence, was lightly dismist. Iassumed an arbitrary velocity of the water and, what is more, took pleasure inmaking it high, thus arriving at a stupendous performance supported by faultlesscalculations. Subsequent reflections, however, on the resistance of pipes tofluid flow determined me to make this invention public property.Another one of my projects was to construct a ring around the equator whichwould, of course, float freely and could be arrested in its spinning motion byreactionary forces, thus enabling travel at a rate of about one thousand milesan hour, impracticable by rail. The reader will smile. The plan was difficult ofexecution, I will admit, but not nearly so bad as that of a well-known New Yorkprofessor, who wanted to pump the air from the torrid to the temperate zones,entirely forgetful of the fact that the Lord had provided a gigantic machine forthis very purpose.Still another scheme, far more important and attractive, was to derive powerfrom the rotational energy of terrestrial bodies. I had discovered that objectson the earth’s surface, owing to the diurnal rotation of the globe, are carriedby the same alternately in and against the direction of translatory movement.From this results a great change in momentum which could be utilized in thesimplest imaginable manner to furnish motive effort in any habitable region ofthe world. I cannot find words to describe my disappointment when later Irealized that I was in the predicament of Archimedes, who vainly sought for afixt point in the universe.At the termination of my vacation I was sent to the Polytechnic School in Gratz,Styria, which my father had chosen as one of the oldest and best reputedinstitutions. That was the moment I had eagerly awaited and I began my studiesunder good auspices and firmly resolved to succeed. My previous training wasabove the average, due to my father’s teaching and opportunities afforded. I hadacquired the knowledge of a number of languages and waded thru the books ofseveral libraries, picking up information more or less useful. Then again, forthe first time, I could choose my subjects as I liked, and free-hand drawing wasto bother me no more. I had made up my mind to give my parents a surprise, andduring the whole first year I regularly started my work at three o’clock in themorning and continued until eleven at night, no Sundays or holidays excepted. Asmost of my fellow-students took things easily, naturally enough I eclipsed allrecords. In the course of that year I past thru nine exams and the professorsthought I deserved more than the highest qualifications. Armed with theirflattering certificates, I went home for a short rest, expecting a triumph, andwas mortified when my father made light of these hard-won honors. That almostkilled my ambition; but later, after he had died, I was pained to find a packageof letters which the professors had written him to the effect that unless hetook me away from the Institution I would be killed thru overwork. Thereafter Idevoted myself chiefly to physics, mechanics and mathematical studies, spendingthe hours of leisure in the libraries. I had a veritable mania for finishingwhatever I began, which often got me into difficulties. On one occasion Istarted to read the works of Voltaire when I learned, to my dismay, that therewere close on one hundred large volumes in small print which that monster hadwritten while drinking seventy-two cups of black coffee per diem. It had to bedone, but when I laid aside the last book I was very glad, and said, “Nevermore!”My first year’s showing had won me the appreciation and friendship of severalprofessors. Among these were Prof. Rogner, who was teaching arithmeticalsubjects and geometry; Prof. Poeschl, who held the chair of theoretical andexperimental physics, and Dr. Allé, who taught integral calculus and specializedin differential equations. This scientist was the most brilliant lecturer towhom I ever listened. He took a special interest in my progress and wouldfrequently remain for an hour or two in the lecture room, giving me problems tosolve, in which I delighted. To him I explained a flying machine I hadconceived, not an illusionary invention, but one based on sound, scientificprinciples, which has become realizable thru my turbine and will soon be givento the world. Both Professors Rogner and Poeschl were curious men. The formerhad peculiar ways of expressing himself and whenever he did so there was a riot,followed by a long and embarrassing pause. Prof. Poeschl was a methodical andthoroly grounded German. He had enormous feet and hands like the paws of a bear,but all of his experiments were skillfully performed with clock-like precisionand without a miss.It was in the second year of my studies that we received a Gramme dynamo fromParis, having the horseshoe form of a laminated field magnet, and a wire-woundarmature with a commutator. It was connected up and various effects of thecurrents were shown. While Prof. Poeschl was making demonstrations, running themachine as a motor, the brushes gave trouble, sparking badly, and I observedthat it might be possible to operate a motor without these appliances. But hedeclared that it could not be done and did me the honor of delivering a lectureon the subject, at the conclusion of which he remarked: “Mr. Tesla mayaccomplish great things, but he certainly never will do this. It would beequivalent to converting a steadily pulling force, like that of gravity, into arotary effort. It is a perpetual motion scheme, an impossible idea.” Butinstinct is something which transcends knowledge. We have, undoubtedly, certainfiner fibers that enable us to perceive truths when logical deduction, or anyother willful effort of the brain, is futile. For a time I wavered, imprest bythe professor’s authority, but soon became convinced I was right and undertookthe task with all the fire and boundless confidence of youth.I started by first picturing in my mind a direct-current machine, running it andfollowing the changing flow of the currents in the armature. Then I wouldimagine an alternator and investigate the processes taking place in a similarmanner. Next I would visualize systems comprising motors and generators andoperate them in various ways. The images I saw were to me perfectly real andtangible. All my remaining term in Gratz was past in intense but fruitlessefforts of this kind, and I almost came to the conclusion that the problem wasinsolvable. In 1880 I went to Prague, Bohemia, carrying out my father’s wish tocomplete my education at the University there. It was in that city that I made adecided advance, which consisted in detaching the commutator from the machineand studying the phenomena in this new aspect, but still without result. In theyear following there was a sudden change in my views of life. I realized that myparents had been making too great sacrifices on my account and resolved torelieve them of the burden. The wave of the American telephone had just reachedthe European continent and the system was to be installed in Budapest, Hungary.It appeared an ideal opportunity, all the more as a friend of our family was atthe head of the enterprise. It was here that I suffered the complete breakdownof the nerves to which I have referred. What I experienced during the period ofthat illness surpasses all belief. My sight and hearing were alwaysextraordinary. I could clearly discern objects in the distance when others sawno trace of them. Several times in my boyhood I saved the houses of ourneighbors from fire by hearing the faint crackling sounds which did not disturbtheir sleep, and calling for help.In 1899, when I was past forty and carrying on my experiments in Colorado, Icould hear very distinctly thunderclaps at a distance of 550 miles. The limit ofaudition for my young assistants was scarcely more than 150 miles. My ear wasthus over thirteen times more sensitive. Yet at that time I was, so to speak,stone deaf in comparison with the acuteness of my hearing while under thenervous strain. In Budapest I could hear the ticking of a watch with three roomsbetween me and the time-piece. A fly alighting on a table in the room wouldcause a dull thud in my ear. A carriage passing at a distance of a few milesfairly shook my whole body. The whistle of a locomotive twenty or thirty milesaway made the bench or chair on which I sat vibrate so strongly that the painwas unbearable. The ground under my feet trembled continuously. I had to supportmy bed on rubber cushions to get any rest at all. The roaring noises from nearand far often produced the effect of spoken words which would have frightened mehad I not been able to resolve them into their accidental components. The sun’srays, when periodically intercepted, would cause blows of such force on my brainthat they would stun me. I had to summon all my will power to pass under abridge or other structure as I experienced a crushing pressure on the skull. Inthe dark I had the sense of a bat and could detect the presence of an object ata distance of twelve feet by a peculiar creepy sensation on the forehead. Mypulse varied from a few to two hundred and sixty beats and all the tissues ofthe body with twitchings and tremors which was perhaps the hardest to bear. Arenowned physician who gave me daily large doses of Bromid of Potassiumpronounced my malady unique and incurable. It is my eternal regret that I wasnot under the observation of experts in physiology and psychology at that time.I clung desperately to life, but never expected to recover. Can anyone believethat so hopeless a physical wreck could ever be transformed into a man ofastonishing strength and tenacity, able to work thirty-eight years almostwithout a day’s interruption, and find himself still strong and fresh in bodyand mind? Such is my case. A powerful desire to live and to continue the work,and the assistance of a devoted friend and athlete accomplished the wonder. Myhealth returned and with it the vigor of mind. In attacking the problem again Ialmost regretted that the struggle was soon to end. I had so much energy tospare. When I undertook the task it was not with a resolve such as men oftenmake. With me it was a sacred vow, a question of life and death. I knew that Iwould perish if I failed. Now I felt that the battle was won. Back in the deeprecesses of the brain was the solution, but I could not yet give it outwardexpression. One afternoon, which is ever present in my recollection, I wasenjoying a walk with my friend in the City Park and reciting poetry. At that ageI knew entire books by heart, word for word. One of these was Göethe’s “Faust.”The sun was just setting and reminded me of the glorious passage:“Sie rückt und weicht, der Tag ist überlebt, Dort eilt sie hin und fördert neuesLeben. Oh, dass kein Flügel mich vom Boden hebt Ihr nach und immer nach zustreben!1 [tesl_9781101565698_oeb_ftn_r1.xhtml#FTN-1] Ein schöner Traum indessen sie entweicht, Ach, zu des Geistes Flügeln wird soleicht Kein körperlicher Flügel sich gesellen!”2[tesl_9781101565698_oeb_ftn_r1.xhtml#FTN-2]As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash of lightning andin an instant the truth was revealed. I drew with a stick on the sand thediagrams shown six years later in my address before the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers, and my companion understood them perfectly. The images Isaw were wonderfully sharp and clear and had the solidity of metal and stone, somuch so that I told him: “See my motor here; watch me reverse it.” I cannotbegin to describe my emotions. Pygmalion seeing his statue come to life couldnot have been more deeply moved. A thousand secrets of nature which I might havestumbled upon accidentally I would have given for that one which I had wrestedfrom her against all odds and at the peril of my existence."},{"pageContent":"PART IVTHE DISCOVERY OF THE TESLA COIL AND TRANSFORMERFor a while I gave myself up entirely to the intense enjoyment of picturingmachines and devising new forms. It was a mental state of happiness about ascomplete as I have ever known in life. Ideas came in an uninterrupted stream andthe only difficulty I had was to hold them fast. The pieces of apparatus Iconceived were to me absolutely real and tangible in every detail, even to theminutest marks and signs of wear. I delighted in imagining the motors constantlyrunning, for in this way they presented to the mind’s eye a more fascinatingsight. When natural inclination develops into a passionate desire, one advancestowards his goal in seven-league boots. In less than two months I evolvedvirtually all the types of motors and modifications of the system which are nowidentified with my name. It was, perhaps, providential that the necessities ofexistence commanded a temporary halt to this consuming activity of the mind. Icame to Budapest prompted by a premature report concerning the telephoneenterprise and, as irony of fate willed it, I had to accept a position asdraftsman in the Central Telegraph Office of the Hungarian Government at asalary which I deem it my privilege not to disclose! Fortunately, I soon won theinterest of the Inspector-in-Chief and was thereafter employed on calculations,designs and estimates in connection with new installations, until the TelephoneExchange was started, when I took charge of the same. The knowledge andpractical experience I gained in the course of this work was most valuable andthe employment gave me ample opportunities for the exercise of my inventivefaculties. I made several improvements in the Central Station apparatus andperfected a telephone repeater or amplifier which was never patented or publiclydescribed but would be creditable to me even today. In recognition of myefficient assistance the organizer of the undertaking, Mr. Puskas, upondisposing of his business in Budapest, offered me a position in Paris which Igladly accepted.I never can forget the deep impression that magic city produced on my mind. Forseveral days after my arrival I roamed thru the streets in utter bewilderment ofthe new spectacle. The attractions were many and irresistible, but, alas, theincome was spent as soon as received. When Mr. Puskas asked me how I was gettingalong in the new sphere, I described the situation accurately in the statementthat “the last twenty-nine days of the month are the toughest!” I led a ratherstrenuous life in what would now be termed “Rooseveltian fashion.” Everymorning, regardless of weather, I would go from the Boulevard St. Marcel, whereI resided, to a bathing house on the Seine, plunge into the water, loop thecircuit twenty-seven times and then walk an hour to reach Ivry, where theCompany’s factory was located. There I would have a wood-chopper’s breakfast athalf-past seven o’clock and then eagerly await the lunch hour, in the meanwhilecracking hard nuts for the Manager of the Works, Mr. Charles Batchellor, who wasan intimate friend and assistant of Edison. Here I was thrown in contact with afew Americans who fairly fell in love with me because of my proficiencyin—billiards. To these men I explained my invention and one of them, Mr. D.Cunningham, Foreman of the Mechanical Department, offered to form a stockcompany. The proposal seemed to me comical in the extreme. I did not have thefaintest conception of what that meant except that it was an American way ofdoing things. Nothing came of it, however, and during the next few months I hadto travel from one to another place in France and Germany to cure the ills ofthe power plants. On my return to Paris I submitted to one of the administratorsof the Company, Mr. Rau, a plan for improving their dynamos and was given anopportunity. My success was complete and the delighted directors accorded me theprivilege of developing automatic regulators which were much desired. Shortlyafter there was some trouble with the lighting plant which has been installed atthe new railroad station in Strassburg, Alsace. The wiring was defective and onthe occasion of the opening ceremonies a large part of a wall was blown out thrua short-circuit right in the presence of old Emperor William I. The GermanGovernment refused to take the plant and the French Company was facing a seriousloss. On account of my knowledge of the German language and past experience, Iwas entrusted with the difficult task of straightening out matters and early in1883 I went to Strassburg on that mission.THE FIRST INDUCTION MOTOR IS BUILTSome of the incidents in that city have left an indelible record on my memory.By a curious coincidence, a number of men who subsequently achieved fame, livedthere about that time. In later life I used to say, “There were bacteria ofgreatness in that old town. Others caught the disease but I escaped!” Thepractical work, correspondence, and conferences with officials kept mepreoccupied day and night, but as soon as I was able to manage I undertook theconstruction of a simple motor in a mechanical shop opposite the railroadstation, having brought with me from Paris some material for that purpose. Theconsummation of the experiment was, however, delayed until the summer of thatyear when I finally had the satisfaction of seeing rotation effected byalternating currents of different phase, and without sliding contacts orcommutator, as I had conceived a year before. It was an exquisite pleasure butnot to compare with the delirium of joy following the first revelation.Among my new friends was the former Mayor of the city, Mr. Bauzin, whom I hadalready in a measure acquainted with this and other inventions of mine and whosesupport I endeavored to enlist. He was sincerely devoted to me and put myproject before several wealthy persons but, to my mortification, found noresponse. He wanted to help me in every possible way and the approach of thefirst of July, 1919, happens to remind me of a form of “assistance” I receivedfrom that charming man, which was not financial but none the less appreciated.In 1870, when the Germans invaded the country, Mr. Bauzin had buried a goodsized allotment of St. Estèphe of 1801 and he came to the conclusion that heknew no worthier person than myself to consume that precious beverage. This, Imay say, is one of the unforgettable incidents to which I have referred. Myfriend urged me to return to Paris as soon as possible and seek support there.This I was anxious to do but my work and negotiations were protracted owing toall sorts of petty obstacles I encountered so that at times the situation seemedhopeless.GERMAN “EFFICIENCY”Just to give an idea of German thoroness and “efficiency,” I may mention here arather funny experience. An incandescent lamp of 16 c.p. was to be placed in ahallway and upon selecting the proper location I ordered the monteur to run thewires. After working for a while he concluded that the engineer had to beconsulted and this was done. The latter made several objections but ultimatelyagreed that the lamp should be placed two inches from the spot I had assigned,whereupon the work proceeded. Then the engineer became worried and told me thatInspector Averdeck should be notified. That important person called,investigated, debated, and decided that the lamp should be shifted back twoinches, which was the place I had marked. It was not long, however, beforeAverdeck got cold feet himself and advised me that he had informedOber-Inspector Hieronimus of the matter and that I should await his decision. Itwas several days before the Ober-Inspector was able to free himself of otherpressing duties but at last he arrived and a two-hour debate followed, when hedecided to move the lamp two inches farther. My hopes that this was the finalact were shattered when the Ober-Inspector returned and said to me:“Regierungsrath Funke is so particular that I would not dare to give an orderfor placing this lamp without his explicit approval.” Accordingly arrangementsfor a visit from that great man were made. We started cleaning up and polishingearly in the morning. Everybody brushed up, I put on my gloves and when Funkecame with his retinue he was ceremoniously received. After two hours’deliberation he suddenly exclaimed: “I must be going,” and pointing to a placeon the ceiling, he ordered me to put the lamp there. It was the exact spot whichI had originally chosen.So it went day after day with variations, but I was determined to achieve atwhatever cost and in the end my efforts were rewarded. By the spring of 1884 allthe differences were adjusted, the plant formally accepted, and I returned toParis with pleasing anticipations. One of the administrators had promised me aliberal compensation in case I succeeded, as well as a fair consideration of theimprovements I had made in their dynamos and I hoped to realize a substantialsum. There were three administrators whom I shall designate as A, B and C forconvenience. When I called on A he told me that B had the say. This gentlemanthought that only C could decide and the latter was quite sure that A alone hadthe power to act. After several laps of this circulus viciosus, it dawned uponme that my reward was a castle in Spain. The utter failure of my attempts toraise capital for development was another disappointment and when Mr. Batchellorprest me to go to America with a view of redesigning the Edison machines, Idetermined to try my fortunes in the Land of Golden Promise. But the chance wasnearly mist. I liquefied my modest assets, secured accommodations and foundmyself at the railroad station as the train was pulling out. At that moment Idiscovered that my money and tickets were gone. What to do was the question.Hercules had plenty of time to deliberate but I had to decide while runningalongside the train with opposite feelings surging in my brain like condenseroscillations. Resolve, helped by dexterity, won out in the nick of time and uponpassing thru the usual experiences, as trivial as unpleasant, I managed toembark for New York with the remnants of my belongings, some poems and articlesI had written, and a package of calculations relating to solutions of anunsolvable integral and to my flying machine. During the voyage I sat most ofthe time at the stern of the ship watching for an opportunity to save somebodyfrom a watery grave, without the slightest thought of danger. Later when I hadabsorbed some of the practical American sense I shivered at the recollection andmarvelled at my former folly.TESLA IN AMERICAI wish that I could put in words my first impressions of this country. In theArabian Tales I read how genii transported people into a land of dreams to livethru delightful adventures. My case was just the reverse. The genii had carriedme from a world of dreams into one of realities. What I had left was beautiful,artistic and fascinating in every way; what I saw here was machined, rough andunattractive. A burly policeman was twirling his stick which looked to me as bigas a log. I approached him politely with the request to direct me. “Six blocksdown, then to the left,” he said, with murder in his eyes. “Is this America?” Iasked myself in painful surprise. “It is a century behind Europe incivilization.” When I went abroad in 1889—five years having elapsed since myarrival here—I became convinced that it was more than one hundred years AHEAD ofEurope and nothing has happened to this day to change my opinion.TESLA MEETS EDISONThe meeting with Edison was a memorable event in my life. I was amazed at thiswonderful man who, without early advantages and scientific training, hadaccomplished so much. I had studied a dozen languages, delved in literature andart, and had spent my best years in libraries reading all sorts of stuff thatfell into my hands, from Newton’s “Principia” to the novels of Paul de Kock, andfelt that most of my life had been squandered. But it did not take long before Irecognized that it was the best thing I could have done. Within a few weeks Ihad won Edison’s confidence and it came about in this way.The S. S. Oregon, the fastest passenger steamer at that time, had both of itslighting machines disabled and its sailing was delayed. As the superstructurehad been built after their installation it was impossible to remove them fromthe hold. The predicament was a serious one and Edison was much annoyed. In theevening I took the necessary instruments with me and went aboard the vesselwhere I stayed for the night. The dynamos were in bad condition, having severalshort-circuits and breaks, but with the assistance of the crew I succeeded inputting them in good shape. At five o’clock in the morning, when passing alongFifth Avenue on my way to the shop, I met Edison with Batchellor and a fewothers as they were returning home to retire. “Here is our Parisian runningaround at night,” he said. When I told him that I was coming from the Oregon andhad repaired both machines, he looked at me in silence and walked away withoutanother word. But when he had gone some distance I heard him remark:“Batchellor, this is a d—n good man,” and from that time on I had full freedomin directing the work. For nearly a year my regular hours were from 10.30 A. M.until 5 o’clock the next morning without a day’s exception. Edison said to me:“I have had many hard-working assistants but you take the cake.” During thisperiod I designed twenty-four different types of standard machines with shortcores and of uniform pattern which replaced the old ones. The Manager hadpromised me fifty thousand dollars on the completion of this task but it turnedout to be a practical joke. This gave me a painful shock and I resigned myposition.Immediately thereafter some people approached me with the proposal of forming anarc light company under my name, to which I agreed. Here finally was anopportunity to develop the motor, but when I broached the subject to my newassociates they said: “No, we want the arc lamp. We don’t care for thisalternating current of yours.” In 1886 my system of arc lighting was perfectedand adopted for factory and municipal lighting, and I was free, but with noother possession than a beautifully engraved certificate of stock ofhypothetical value. Then followed a period of struggle in the new medium forwhich I was not fitted, but the reward came in the end and in April, 1887, theTesla Electric Company was organized, providing a laboratory and facilities. Themotors I built there were exactly as I had imagined them. I made no attempt toimprove the design, but merely reproduced the pictures as they appeared to myvision and the operation was always as I expected.In the early part of 1888 an arrangement was made with the Westinghouse Companyfor the manufacture of the motors on a large scale. But great difficulties hadstill to be overcome. My system was based on the use of low frequency currentsand the Westinghouse experts had adopted 133 cycles with the object of securingadvantages in the transformation. They did not want to depart from theirstandard forms of apparatus and my efforts had to be concentrated upon adaptingthe motor to these conditions. Another necessity was to produce a motor capableof running efficiently at this frequency on two wires which was not easy ofaccomplishment.At the close of 1889, however, my services in Pittsburg being no longeressential, I returned to New York and resumed experimental work in a laboratoryon Grand Street, where I began immediately the design of high frequencymachines. The problems of construction in this unexplored field were novel andquite peculiar and I encountered many difficulties. I rejected the inductortype, fearing that it might not yield perfect sine waves which were so importantto resonant action. Had it not been for this I could have saved myself a greatdeal of labor. Another discouraging feature of the high frequency alternatorseemed to be the inconstancy of speed which threatened to impose seriouslimitations to its use. I had already noted in my demonstrations before theAmerican Institution of Electrical Engineers that several times the tune waslost, necessitating readjustment, and did not yet foresee, what I discoveredlong afterwards, a means of operating a machine of this kind at a speed constantto such a degree as not to vary more than a small fraction of one revolutionbetween the extremes of load.THE INVENTION OF THE TESLA COILFrom many other considerations it appeared desirable to invent a simpler devicefor the production of electric oscillations. In 1856 Lord Kelvin had exposed thetheory of the condenser discharge, but no practical application of thatimportant knowledge was made. I saw the possibilities and undertook thedevelopment of induction apparatus on this principle. My progress was so rapidas to enable me to exhibit at my lecture in 1891 a coil giving sparks of fiveinches. On that occasion I frankly told the engineers of a defect involved inthe transformation by the new method, namely, the loss in the spark gap.Subsequent investigation showed that no matter what medium is employed, be itair, hydrogen, mercury vapor, oil or a stream of electrons, the efficiency isthe same. It is a law very much like that governing the conversion of mechanicalenergy. We may drop a weight from a certain height vertically down or carry itto the lower level along any devious path, it is immaterial insofar as theamount of work is concerned. Fortunately however, this drawback is not fatal asby proper proportioning of the resonant circuits an efficiency of 85 per cent isattainable. Since my early announcement of the invention it has come intouniversal use and wrought a revolution in many departments. But a still greaterfuture awaits it. When in 1900 I obtained powerful discharges of 100 feet andflashed a current around the globe, I was reminded of the first tiny spark Iobserved in my Grand Street laboratory and was thrilled by sensations akin tothose I felt when I discovered the rotating magnetic field."},{"pageContent":"PART VTHE MAGNIFYING TRANSMITTERAs I review the events of my past life I realize how subtle are the influencesthat shape our destinies. An incident of my youth may serve to illustrate. Onewinter’s day I managed to climb a steep mountain, in company with other boys.The snow was quite deep and a warm southerly wind made it just suitable for ourpurpose. We amused ourselves by throwing balls which would roll down a certaindistance, gathering more or less snow, and we tried to outdo one another in thisexciting sport. Suddenly a ball was seen to go beyond the limit, swelling toenormous proportions until it became as big as a house and plunged thunderinginto the valley below with a force that made the ground tremble. I looked onspellbound, incapable of understanding what had happened. For weeks afterwardthe picture of the avalanche was before my eyes and I wondered how anything sosmall could grow to such an immense size. Ever since that time the magnificationof feeble actions fascinated me, and when, years later, I took up theexperimental study of mechanical and electrical resonance, I was keenlyinterested from the very start. Possibly, had it not been for that earlypowerful impression, I might not have followed up the little spark I obtainedwith my coil and never developed my best invention, the true history of which Iwill tell here for the first time.SCRAPPING THE WORLD’S ENGINES“Lionhunters” have often asked me which of my discoveries I prize most. Thisdepends on the point of view. Not a few technical men, very able in theirspecial departments, but dominated by a pedantic spirit and nearsighted, haveasserted that excepting the induction motor I have given to the world little ofpractical use. This is a grievous mistake. A new idea must not be judged by itsimmediate results. My alternating system of power transmission came at apsychological moment, as a long-sought answer to pressing industrial questions,and altho considerable resistance had to be overcome and opposing interestsreconciled, as usual, the commercial introduction could not be long delayed.Now, compare this situation with that confronting my turbine, for example. Oneshould think that so simple and beautiful an invention, possessing many featuresof an ideal motor, should be adopted at once and, undoubtedly, it would undersimilar conditions. But the prospective effect of the rotating field was not torender worthless existing machinery; on the contrary, it was to give itadditional value. The system lent itself to new enterprise as well as toimprovement of the old. My turbine is an advance of a character entirelydifferent. It is a radical departure in the sense that its success would meanthe abandonment of the antiquated types of prime movers on which billions ofdollars have been spent. Under such circumstances the progress must needs beslow and perhaps the greatest impediment is encountered in the prejudicialopinions created in the minds of experts by organized opposition. Only the otherday I had a disheartening experience when I met my friend and former assistant,Charles F. Scott, now professor of Electrical Engineering at Yale. I had notseen him for a long time and was glad to have an opportunity for a little chatat my office. Our conversation naturally enough drifted on my turbine and Ibecame heated to a high degree. “Scott,” I exclaimed, carried away by the visionof a glorious future, “my turbine will scrap all the heat-engines in the world.”Scott stroked his chin and looked away thoughtfully, as though making a mentalcalculation. “That will make quite a pile of scrap,” he said, and left withoutanother word!“ALADDIN’S LAMP”These and other inventions of mine, however, were nothing more than stepsforward in certain directions. In evolving them I simply followed the inborninstinct to improve the present devices without any special thought of our farmore imperative necessities. The “Magnifying Transmitter” was the product oflabors extending through years, having for their chief object the solution ofproblems which are infinitely more important to mankind than mere industrialdevelopment.If my memory serves me right, it was in November, 1890, that I performed alaboratory experiment which was one of the most extraordinary and spectacularever recorded in the annals of science. In investigating the behaviour of highfrequency currents I had satisfied myself that an electric field of sufficientintensity could be produced in a room to light up electrodeless vacuum tubes.Accordingly, a transformer was built to test the theory and the first trialproved a marvelous success. It is difficult to appreciate what those strangephenomena meant at that time. We crave for new sensations but soon becomeindifferent to them. The wonders of yesterday are today common occurrences. Whenmy tubes were first publicly exhibited they were viewed with amazementimpossible to describe. From all parts of the world I received urgentinvitations and numerous honors and other flattering inducements were offered tome, which I declined.IN FARADAY’S CHAIRBut in 1892 the demands became irresistible and I went to London where Idelivered a lecture before the Institution of Electrical Engineers. It had beenmy intention to leave immediately for Paris in compliance with a similarobligation, but Sir James Dewar insisted on my appearing before the RoyalInstitution. I was a man of firm resolve but succumbed easily to the forcefularguments of the great Scotchman. He pushed me into a chair and poured out halfa glass of a wonderful brown fluid which sparkled in all sorts of iridescentcolors and tasted like nectar. “Now,” said he, “you are sitting in Faraday’schair and you are enjoying whiskey he used to drink.” In both aspects it was anenviable experience. The next evening I gave a demonstration before thatInstitution, at the termination of which Lord Rayleigh addressed the audienceand his generous words gave me the first start in these endeavors. I fled fromLondon and later from Paris to escape favors showered upon me, and journeyed tomy home where I passed through a most painful ordeal and illness. Upon regainingmy health I began to formulate plans for the resumption of work in America. Upto that time I never realized that I possessed any particular gift of discoverybut Lord Rayleigh, whom I always considered as an ideal man of science, had saidso and if that was the case I felt that I should concentrate on some big idea.NATURE’S TRIGGEROne day, as I was roaming in the mountains, I sought shelter from an approachingstorm. The sky became overhung with heavy clouds but somehow the rain wasdelayed until, all of a sudden, there was a lightning flash and a few momentsafter a deluge. This observation set me thinking. It was manifest that the twophenomena were closely related, as cause and effect, and a little reflection ledme to the conclusion that the electrical energy involved in the precipitation ofthe water was inconsiderable, the function of lightning being much like that ofa sensitive trigger. Here was a stupendous possibility of achievement. If wecould produce electric effects of the required quality, this whole planet andthe conditions of existence on it could be transformed. The sun raises the waterof the oceans and winds drive it to distant regions where it remains in a stateof most delicate balance. If it were in our power to upset it when and whereverdesired, this mighty life-sustaining stream could be at will controlled. Wecould irrigate arid deserts, create lakes and rivers and provide motive power inunlimited amounts. This would be the most efficient way of harnessing the sun tothe uses of man. The consummation depended on our ability to develop electricforces of the order of those in nature. It seemed a hopeless undertaking, but Imade up my mind to try it and immediately on my return to the United States, inthe summer of 1892, work was begun which was to me all the more attractive,because a means of the same kind was necessary for the successful transmissionof energy without wires.FOUR MILLION VOLTSThe first gratifying result was obtained in the spring of the succeeding yearwhen I reached tensions of about 1,000,000 volts with my conical coil. That wasnot much in the light of the present art, but it was then considered a feat.Steady progress was made until the destruction of my laboratory by fire in 1895,as may be judged from an article by T. C. Martin which appeared in the Aprilnumber of the Century Magazine. This calamity set me back in many ways and mostof that year had to be devoted to planning and reconstruction. However, as soonas circumstances permitted, I returned to the task. Although I knew that higherelectro-motive forces were attainable with apparatus of larger dimensions, I hadan instinctive perception that the object could be accomplished by the properdesign of a comparatively small and compact transformer. In carrying on testswith a secondary in the form of a flat spiral, as illustrated in my patents, theabsence of streamers surprised me, and it was not long before I discovered thatthis was due to the position of the turns and their mutual action. Profitingfrom this observation I resorted to the use of a high tension conductor withturns of considerable diameter sufficiently separated to keep down thedistributed capacity, while at the same time preventing undue accumulation ofthe charge at any point. The application of this principle enabled me to producepressures of 4,000,000 volts, which was about the limit obtainable in my newlaboratory at Houston Street, as the discharges extended through a distance of16 feet. A photograph of this transmitter was published in the Electrical ReviewofNovember, 1898. In order to advance further along this line I had to go into theopen, and in the spring of 1899, having completed preparations for the erectionof a wireless plant, I went to Colorado where I remained for more than one year.Here I introduced other improvements and refinements which made it possible togenerate currents of any tension that may be desired. Those who are interestedwill find some information in regard to the experiments I conducted there in myarticle, “The Problem of Increasing Human Energy” in the Century Magazine ofJune, 1900, to which I have referred on a previous occasion.THE MAGNI FYING TRANSMITTERI have been asked by the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER to be quite explicit on thissubject so that my young friends among the readers of the magazine will clearlyunderstand the construction and operation of my “Magnifying Transmitter” and thepurposes for which it is intended. Well, then, in the first place, it is aresonant transformer with a secondary in which the parts, charged to a highpotential, are of considerable area and arranged in space along ideal envelopingsurfaces of very large radii of curvature, and at proper distances from oneanother thereby insuring a small electric surface density everywhere so that noleak can occur even if the conductor is bare. It is suitable for any frequency,from a few to many thousands of cycles per second, and can be used in theproduction of currents of tremendous volume and moderate pressure, or of smalleramperage and immense electro-motive force. The maximum electric tension ismerely dependent on the curvature of the surfaces on which the charged elementsare situated and the area of the latter.100 MILLION VOLTS POSSIBLEJudging from my past experience, as much as 100,000,000 volts are perfectlypracticable. On the other hand currents of many thousands of amperes may beobtained in the antenna. A plant of but very moderate dimensions is required forsuch performances. Theoretically, a terminal of less than 90 feet in diameter issufficient to develop an electro-motive force of that magnitude while forantenna currents of from 2,000–4,000 amperes at the usual frequencies it neednot be larger than 30 feet in diameter.In a more restricted meaning this wireless transmitter is one in which theHertz-wave radiation is an entirely negligible quantity as compared with thewhole energy, under which condition the damping factor is extremely small and anenormous charge is stored in the elevated capacity. Such a circuit may then beexcited with impulses of any kind, even of low frequency and it will yieldsinusoidal and continuous oscillations like those of an alternator.Taken in the narrowest significance of the term, however, it is a resonanttransformer which, besides possessing these qualities, is accuratelyproportioned to fit the globe and its electrical constants and properties, byvirtue of which design it becomes highly efficient and effective in the wirelesstransmission of energy. Distance is then absolutely eliminated, there being nodiminution in the intensity of the transmitted impulses. It is even possible tomake the actions increase with the distance from the plant according to an exactmathematical law.This invention was one of a number comprised in my “World-System” of wirelesstransmission which I undertook to commercialize on my return to New York in1900. As to the immediate purposes of my enterprise, they were clearly outlinedin a technical statement of that period from which I quote:“The ‘World-System’ has resulted from a combination of several originaldiscoveries made by the inventor in the course of long continued research andexperimentation. It makes possible not only the instantaneous and precisewireless transmission of any kind of signals, messages or characters, to allparts of the world, but also the inter-connection of the existing telegraph,telephone, and other signal stations without any change in their presentequipment. By its means, for instance, a telephone subscriber here may call upand talk to any other subscriber on the Globe. An inexpensive receiver, notbigger than a watch, will enable him to listen anywhere, on land or sea, to aspeech delivered or music played in some other place, however distant. Theseexamples are cited merely to give an idea of the possibilities of this greatscientific advance, which annihilates distance and makes that perfect naturalconductor, the Earth, available for all the innumerable purposes which humaningenuity has found for a line-wire. One far-reaching result of this is that anydevice capable of being operated thru one or more wires (at a distance obviouslyrestricted) can likewise be actuated, without artificial conductors and with thesame facility and accuracy, at distances to which there are no limits other thanthose imposed by the physical dimensions of the Globe. Thus, not only willentirely new fields for commercial exploitation be opened up by this idealmethod of transmission but the old ones vastly extended.“The ‘World-System’ is based on the application of the following importantinventions and discoveries:“1. The ‘Tesla Transformer.’ This apparatus is in the production of electricalvibrations as revolutionary as gunpowder was in warfare. Currents many timesstronger than any ever generated in the usual ways, and sparks over one hundredfeet long, have been produced by the inventor with an instrument of this kind.“2. The ‘Magnifying Transmitter.’ This is Tesla’s best invention—a peculiartransformer specially adapted to excite the Earth, which is in the transmissionof electrical energy what the telescope is in astronomical observation. By theuse of this marvelous device he has already set up electrical movements ofgreater intensity than those of lightning and passed a current, sufficient tolight more than two hundred incandescent lamps, around the Globe.“3. The ‘Tesla Wireless System.’ This system comprises a number of improvementsand is the only means known for transmitting economically electrical energy to adistance without wires. Careful tests and measurements in connection with anexperimental station of great activity, erected by the inventor in Colorado,have demonstrated that power in any desired amount can be conveyed, clear acrossthe Globe if necessary, with a loss not exceeding a few per cent.“4. The ‘Art of Individualisation.’ This invention of Tesla is to primitive‘tuning’ what refined language is to unarticulated expression. It makes possiblethe transmission of signals or messages absolutely secret and exclusive both inthe active and passive aspect, that is, non-interfering as well asnon-interferable. Each signal is like an individual of unmistakable identity andthere is virtually no limit to the number of stations or instruments which canbe simultaneously operated without the slightest mutual disturbance.“5. The ‘Terrestial Stationary Waves.’ This wonderful discovery, popularlyexplained, means that the Earth is responsive to electrical vibrations ofdefinite pitch just as a tuning fork to certain waves of sound. These particularelectrical vibrations, capable of powerfully exciting the Globe, lend themselvesto innumerable uses of great importance commercially and in many other respects.“The first ‘World-System’ power plant can be put in operation in nine months.With this power plant it will be practicable to attain electrical activities upto ten million horsepower and it is designed to serve for as many technicalachievements as are possible without due expense. Among these the following maybe mentioned:“(1) The inter-connection of the existing telegraph exchanges or offices allover the world;“(2) The establishment of a secret and non-interferable government telegraphservice;“(3) The inter-connection of all the present telephone exchanges or offices onthe Globe;“(4) The universal distribution of general news, by telegraph or telephone, inconnection with the Press;“(5) The establishment of such a ‘World-System’ of intelligence transmission forexclusive private use;“(6) The inter-connection and operation of all stock tickers of the world;“(7) The establishment of a ‘World-System’ of musical distribution, etc.;“(8) The universal registration of time by cheap clocks indicating the hour withastronomical precision and requiring no attention whatever;“(9) The world transmission of typed or handwritten characters, letters, checks,etc.;“(10) The establishment of a universal marine service enabling the navigators ofall ships to steer perfectly without compass, to determine the exact location,hour and speed, to prevent collisions and disasters, etc.;“(11) The inauguration of a system of world-printing on land and sea;“(12) The world reproduction of photographic pictures and all kinds of drawingsor records.”I also proposed to make demonstrations in the wireless transmission of power ona small scale but sufficient to carry conviction. Besides these I referred toother and incomparably more important applications of my discoveries which willbe disclosed at some future date.A plant was built on Long Island with a tower 187 feet high, having a sphericalterminal about 68 feet in diameter. These dimensions were adequate for thetransmission of virtually any amount of energy. Originally only from 200 to 300K.W. were provided but I intended to employ later several thousand horsepower.The transmitter was to emit a wave-complex of special characteristics and I haddevised a unique method of telephonic control of any amount of energy.The tower was destroyed two years ago but my projects are being developed andanother one, improved in some features, will be constructed. On this occasion Iwould contradict the widely circulated report that the structure was demolishedby the Government which owing to war conditions, might have created prejudice inthe minds of those who may not know that the papers, which thirty years agoconferred upon me the honor of American citizenship, are always kept in a safe,while my orders, diplomas, degrees, gold medals and other distinctions arepacked away in old trunks. If this report had a foundation I would have beenrefunded a large sum of money which I expended in the construction of the tower.On the contrary it was in the interest of the Government to preserve it,particularly as it would have made possible—to mention just one valuableresult—the location of a submarine in any part of the world. My plant, services,and all my improvements have always been at the disposal of the officials andever since the outbreak of the European conflict I have been working at asacrifice on several inventions of mine relating to aerial navigation, shippropulsion and wireless transmission which are of the greatest importance to thecountry. Those who are well informed know that my ideas have revolutionized theindustries of the United States and I am not aware that there lives an inventorwho has been, in this respect, as fortunate as myself especially as regards theuse of his improvements in the war. I have refrained from publicly expressingmyself on this subject before as it seemed improper to dwell on personal matterswhile all the world was in dire trouble. I would add further, in view of variousrumors which have reached me, that Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan did not interesthimself with me in a business way but in the same large spirit in which he hasassisted many other pioneers. He carried out his generous promise to the letterand it would have been most unreasonable to expect from him anything more. Hehad the highest regard for my attainments and gave me every evidence of hiscomplete faith in my ability to ultimately achieve what I had set out to do. Iam unwilling to accord to some small-minded and jealous individuals thesatisfaction of having thwarted my efforts. These men are to me nothing morethan microbes of a nasty disease. My project was retarded by laws of nature. Theworld was not prepared for it. It was too far ahead of time. But the same lawswill prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success."},{"pageContent":"PART VITHE ART OF TELAUTOMATICSHOW TESLA’S MIND RECUPERATESNo subject to which I have ever devoted myself has called for such concentrationof mind and strained to so dangerous a degree the finest fibers of my brain asthe system of which the Magnifying Transmitter is the foundation. I put all theintensity and vigor of youth in the development of the rotating fielddiscoveries, but those early labors were of a different character. Althoughstrenuous in the extreme, they did not involve that keen and exhaustingdiscernment which had to be exercised in attacking the many puzzling problems ofthe wireless. Despite my rare physical endurance at that period the abusednerves finally rebelled and I suffered a complete collapse, just as theconsummation of the long and difficult task was almost in sight. Without doubt Iwould have paid a greater penalty later, and very likely my career would havebeen prematurely terminated, had not providence equipt me with a safety device,which has seemed to improve with advancing years and unfailingly comes into playwhen my forces are at an end. So long as it operates I am safe from danger, dueto overwork, which threatens other inventors and, incidentally, I need novacations which are indispensable to most people. When I am all but used up Isimply do as the darkies, who “naturally fall asleep while white folks worry.”To venture a theory out of my sphere—the body probably accumulates little bylittle a definite quantity of some toxic agent and I sink into a nearlylethargic state which lasts half an hour to the minute. Upon awakening I havethe sensation as though the events immediately preceding had occurred very longago, and if I attempt to continue the interrupted train of thought I feel averitable mental nausea. Involuntarily I then turn to other work and amsurprised at the freshness of the mind and ease with which I overcome obstaclesthat had baffled me before. After weeks or months my passion for the temporarilyabandoned invention returns and I invariably find answers to all the vexingquestions with scarcely any effort. In this connection I will tell of anextraordinary experience which may be of interest to students of psychology. Ihad produced a striking phenomenon with my grounded transmitter and wasendeavoring to ascertain its true significance in relation to the currentspropagated through the earth. It seemed a hopeless undertaking, and for morethan a year I worked unremittingly, but in vain. This profound study so entirelyabsorbed me that I became forgetful of everything else, even of my underminedhealth. At last, as I was at the point of breaking down, nature applied thepreservative inducing lethal sleep. Regaining my senses, I realized withconsternation that I was unable to visualize scenes from my life except those ofinfancy, the very first ones that had entered my consciousness. Curiouslyenough, these appeared before my vision with startling distinctness and affordedme welcome relief. Night after night, when retiring, I would think of them andmore and more of my previous existence was revealed. The image of my mother wasalways the principal figure in the spectacle that slowly unfolded, and aconsuming desire to see her again gradually took possession of me. This feelinggrew so strong that I resolved to drop all work and satisfy my longing. But Ifound it too hard to break away from the laboratory, and several months elapsedduring which I had succeeded in reviving all the impressions of my past life upto the spring of 1892. In the next picture that came out of the mist ofoblivion, I saw myself at the Hotel de la Paix in Paris just coming to from oneof my peculiar sleeping spells, which had been caused by prolonged exertion ofthe brain. Imagine the pain and distress I felt when it flashed upon my mindthat a dispatch was handed to me at that very moment bearing the sad news thatmy mother was dying; I remembered how I made the long journey home without anhour of rest and how she passed away after weeks of agony! It was especiallyremarkable that during all this period of partially obliterated memory I wasfully alive to everything touching on the subject of my research. I could recallthe smallest details and the least insignificant observations in my experimentsand even recite pages of text and complex mathematical formulae.My belief is firm in a law of compensation. The true rewards are ever inproportion to the labor and sacrifices made. This is one of the reasons why Ifeel certain that of all my inventions, the Magnifying Transmitter will provemost important and valuable to future generations. I am prompted to thisprediction not so much by thoughts of the commercial and industrial revolutionwhich it will surely bring about, but of the humanitarian consequences of themany achievements it makes possible. Considerations of mere utility weigh littlein the balance against the higher benefits of civilization. We are confrontedwith portentous problems which can not be solved just by providing for ourmaterial existence, however abundantly. On the contrary, progress in thisdirection is fraught with hazards and perils not less menacing than those bornfrom want and suffering. If we were to release the energy of atoms or discoversome other way of developing cheap and unlimited power at any point of the globethis accomplishment, instead of being a blessing, might bring disaster tomankind in giving rise to dissension and anarchy which would ultimately resultin the enthronement of the hated regime of force. The greatest good will comesfrom technical improvements tending to unification and harmony, and my wirelesstransmitter is preeminently such. By its means the human voice and likeness willbe reproduced everywhere and factories driven thousands of miles from waterfallsfurnishing the power; aerial machines will be propelled around the earth withouta stop and the sun’s energy controlled to create lakes and rivers for motivepurposes and transformation of arid deserts into fertile land. Its introductionfor telegraphic, telephonic and similar uses will automatically cut out thestatics and all other interferences which at present impose narrow limits to theapplication of the wireless. This is a timely topic on which a few words mightnot be amiss.TESLA RAPS “STATIC” MEN VIGOROUSLYDuring the past decade a number of people have arrogantly claimed that they hadsucceeded in doing away with this impediment. I have carefully examined all ofthe arrangements described and tested most of them long before they werepublicly disclosed, but the finding was uniformly negative. A recent officialstatement from the U. S. Navy may, perhaps, have taught some beguilable newseditors how to appraise these announcements at their real worth. As a rule theattempts are based on theories so fallacious that whenever they come to mynotice I can not help thinking in a lighter vein. Quite recently a new discoverywas heralded, with a deafening flourish of trumpets, but it proved another caseof a mountain bringing forth a mouse. This reminds me of an exciting incidentwhich took place years ago when I was conducting my experiments with currents ofhigh frequency. Steve Brodie had just jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge. The feathas been vulgarized since by imitators, but the first report electrified NewYork. I was very impressionable then and frequently spoke of the daring printer.On a hot afternoon I felt the necessity of refreshing myself and stepped intoone of the popular thirty thousand institutions of this great city where adelicious twelve per cent beverage was served which can now be had only bymaking a trip to the poor and devastated countries of Europe. The attendance waslarge and not over-distinguished and a matter was discussed which gave me anadmirable opening for the careless remark: “This is what I said when I jumpedoff the bridge.” No sooner had I uttered these words than I felt like thecompanion of Timotheus in the poem of Schiller. In an instant there was apandemonium and a dozen voices cried: “It is Brodie!” I threw a quarter on thecounter and bolted for the door but the crowd was at my heels with yells: “Stop,Steve!” which must have been misunderstood for many persons tried to hold me upas I ran frantically for my haven of refuge. By darting around corners Ifortunately managed—through the medium of a fire-escape—to reach the laboratory,where I threw off my coat, camouflaged myself as a hard-working blacksmith, andstarted the forge. But these precautions proved unnecessary; I had eluded mypursuers. For many years afterward, at night, when imagination turns intospectres the trifling troubles of the day, I often thought, as I tossed on thebed, what my fate would have been had that mob caught me and found out that Iwas not Steve Brodie!Now the engineer, who lately gave an account before a technical body of a novelremedy against statics based on a “heretofore unknown law of nature,” seems tohave been as reckless as myself when he contended that these disturbancespropagate up and down, while those of a transmitter proceed along the earth. Itwould mean that a condenser, as this globe, with its gaseous envelope, could becharged and discharged in a manner quite contrary to the fundamental teachingspropounded in every elemental text-book of physics. Such a supposition wouldhave been condemned as erroneous, even in Franklin’s time, for the facts bearingon this were then well known and the identity between atmospheric electricityand that developed by machines was fully established. Obviously, natural andartificial disturbances propagate through the earth and the air in exactly thesame way, and both set up electro-motive forces in the horizontal, as well asvertical, sense. Interference can not be overcome by any such methods as wereproposed. The truth is this: In the air the potential increases at the rate ofabout fifty volts per foot of elevation, owing to which there may be adifference of pressure amounting to twenty, or even forty thousand volts betweenthe upper and lower ends of the antenna. The masses of the charged atmosphereare constantly in motion and give up electricity to the conductor, notcontinuously but rather disruptively, this producing a grinding noise in asensitive telephonic receiver. The higher the terminal and the greater the spaceencompast by the wires, the more pronounced is the effect, but it must beunderstood that it is purely local and has little to do with the real trouble.In 1900, while perfecting my wireless system, one form of apparatus comprisedfour antennae. These were carefully calibrated to the same frequency andconnected in multiple with the object of magnifying the action, in receivingfrom any direction. When I desired to ascertain the origin of the transmittedimpulses, each diagonally situated pair was put in series with a primary coilenergizing the detector circuit. In the former case the sound was loud in thetelephone; in the latter it ceased, as expected, the two antennae neutralizingeach other, but the true statics manifested themselves in both instances and Ihad to devise special preventives embodying different principles.THE REMEDY FOR STATICBy employing receivers connected to two points of the ground, as suggested by melong ago, this trouble caused by the charged air, which is very serious in thestructures as now built, is nullified and besides, the liability of all kinds ofinterference is reduced to about one-half, because of the directional characterof the circuit. This was perfectly self-evident, but came as a revelation tosome simple-minded wireless folks whose experience was confined to forms ofapparatus that could have been improved with an axe, and they have beendisposing of the bear’s skin before killing him. If it were true that straysperformed such antics, it would be easy to get rid of them by receiving withoutaerials. But, as a matter of fact, a wire buried in the ground which, conformingto this view, should be absolutely immune, is more susceptible to certainextraneous impulses than one placed vertically in the air. To state it fairly, aslight progress has been made, but not by virtue of any particular method ordevice. It was achieved simply by discarding the enormous structures, which arebad enough for transmission but wholly unsuitable for reception, and adopting amore appropriate type of receiver. As I pointed out in a previous article, todispose of this difficulty for good, a radical change must be made in thesystem, and the sooner this is done the better.RADIO GOVERNMENT CONTROL NOT WANTEDIt would be calamitous, indeed, if at this time when the art is in its infancyand the vast majority, not excepting even experts, have no conception of itsultimate possibilities, a measure would be rushed through the legislature makingit a government monopoly. This was proposed a few weeks ago by SecretaryDaniels, and no doubt that distinguished official has made his appeal to theSenate and House of Representatives with sincere conviction. But universalevidence unmistakably shows that the best results are always obtained inhealthful commercial competition. There are, however, exceptional reasons whywireless should be given the fullest freedom of development. In the first placeit offers prospects immeasurably greater and more vital to betterment of humanlife than any other invention or discovery in the history of man. Then again, itmust be understood that this wonderful art has been, in its entirety, evolvedhere and can be called “American” with more right and propriety than thetelephone, the incandescent lamp or the aeroplane. Enterprising press agents andstock jobbers have been so successful in spreading misinformation that even soexcellent a periodical as the Scientific American accords the chief credit to aforeign country. The Germans, of course, gave us the Hertz-waves and theRussian, English, French and Italian experts were quick in using them forsignaling purposes. It was an obvious application of the new agent andaccomplished with the old classical and unimproved induction coil—scarcelyanything more than another kind of heliography. The radius of transmission wasvery limited, the results attained of little value, and the Hertz oscillations,as a means for conveying intelligence, could have been advantageously replacedby sound-waves, which I advocated in 1891. Moreover, all of these attempts weremade three years after the basic principles of the wireless system, which isuniversally employed to-day, and its potent instrumentalities had been clearlydescribed and developed in America. No trace of those Hertzian appliances andmethods remains today. We have proceeded in the very opposite direction and whathas been done is the product of the brains and efforts of citizens of thiscountry. The fundamental patents have expired and the opportunities are open toall. The chief argument of the Secretary is based on interference. According tohis statement, reported in the New York Herald of July 29th, signals from apowerful station can be intercepted in every village of the world. In view ofthis fact, which was demonstrated in my experiments of 1900, it would be oflittle use to impose restrictions in the United States.AMERICA FIRSTAs throwing light on this point, I may mention that only recently an odd lookinggentleman called on me with the object of enlisting my services in theconstruction of world transmitters in some distant land. “We have no money,” hesaid, “but carloads of solid gold and we will give you a liberal amount.” I toldhim that I wanted to see first what will be done with my inventions in America,and this ended the interview. But I am satisfied that some dark forces are atwork, and as time goes on the maintenance of continuous communication will berendered more difficult. The only remedy is a system immune againstinterruption. It has been perfected, it exists, and all that is necessary is toput it in operation.The terrible conflict is still uppermost in the minds and perhaps the greatestimportance will be attached to the Magnifying Transmitter as a machine forattack and defense, more particularly in connection with Telautomatics. Thisinvention is a logical outcome of observations begun in my boyhood and continuedthruout my life. When the first results were publisht the Electrical Reviewstated editorially that it would become one of the “most potent factors in theadvance and civilization of mankind.” The time is not distant when thisprediction will be fulfilled. In 1898 and 1900 it was offered to the Governmentand might have been adopted were I one of those who would go to Alexander’sshepherd when they want a favor from Alexander. At that time I really thoughtthat it would abolish war, because of its unlimited destructiveness andexclusion of the personal element of combat. But while I have not lost faith inits potentialities, my views have changed since.THE ROAD TO PERMANENT PEACEWar can not be avoided until the physical cause for its recurrence is removedand this, in the last analysis, is the vast extent of the planet on which welive. Only thru annihilation of distance in every respect as, the conveyance ofintelligence, transport of passengers and supplies and transmission of energywill conditions be brought about some day, insuring permanency of friendlyrelations. What we now want most is closer contact and better understandingbetween individuals and communities all over the earth, and the elimination ofthat fanatic devotion to exalted ideals of national egoism and pride which isalways prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism and strife. No leagueor parliamentary act of any kind will ever prevent such a calamity. These areonly new devices for putting the weak at the mercy of the strong. I have exprestmyself in this regard fourteen years ago, when a combination of a few leadinggovernments—a sort of Holy Alliance—was advocated by the late Andrew Carnegie,who may be fairly considered as the father of this idea, having given to it morepublicity and impetus than anybody else prior to the efforts of the President.While it can not be denied that such a pact might be of material advantage tosome less fortunate peoples, it can not attain the chief object sought. Peacecan only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment and merging ofraces, and we are still far from this blissful realization. As I view the worldof today, in the light of the gigantic struggle we have witnest, I am filledwith conviction that the interests of humanity would be best served if theUnited States remained true to its traditions and kept out of “entanglingalliances.” Situated as it is, geographically, remote from the theaters ofimpending conflicts, without incentive to territorial aggrandizement, withinexhaustible resources and immense population thoroly imbued with the spirit ofliberty and right, this country is placed in a unique and privileged position.It is thus able to exert, independently, its colossal strength and moral forceto the benefit of all, more judiciously and effectively, than as member of aleague.THE MECHANISTIC THEORY OF LIFEIn one of these biographical sketches, published in the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER,I have dwelt on the circumstances of my early life and told of an afflictionwhich compelled me to unremitting exercise of imagination and self-observation.This mental activity, at first involuntary under the pressure of illness andsuffering, gradually became second nature and led me finally to recognize that Iwas but an automaton devoid of free will in thought and action and merelyresponsive to the forces of the environment. Our bodies are of such complexityof structure, the motions we perform are so numerous and involved, and theexternal impressions on our sense organs to such a degree delicate and elusivethat it is hard for the average person to grasp this fact. And yet nothing ismore convincing to the trained investigator than the mechanistic theory of lifewhich had been, in a measure, understood and propounded by Descartes threehundred years ago. But in his time many important functions of our organism wereunknown and, especially with respect to the nature of light and the constructionand operation of the eye, philosophers were in the dark. In recent years theprogress of scientific research in these fields has been such as to leave noroom for a doubt in regard to this view on which many works have been published.One of its ablest and most eloquent exponents is, perhaps, Felix Le Dantoc,formerly assistant of Pasteur. Prof. Jacques Loeb has performed remarkableexperiments in heliotropism, clearly establishing the controlling power of lightin lower forms of organisms, and his latest book, “Forced Movements,” isrevelatory. But while men of science accept this theory simply as any other thatis recognized, to me it is a truth which I hourly demonstrate by every act andthought of mine. The consciousness of the external impression prompting me toany kind of exertion, physical or mental, is ever present in my mind. Only onvery rare occasions, when I was in a state of exceptional concentration, have Ifound difficulty in locating the original impulses.LACK OF OBSERVATION A FORM OF IGNORANCEThe by far greater number of human beings are never aware of what is passingaround and within them, and millions fall victims of disease and die prematurelyjust on this account. The commonest, every-day occurrences appear to themmysterious and inexplicable. One may feel a sudden wave of sadness and rake hisbrain for an explanation when he might have noticed that it was caused by acloud cutting off the rays of the sun. He may see the image of a friend dear tohim under conditions which he construes as very peculiar, when only shortlybefore he has passed him in the street or seen his photograph somewhere. When heloses a collar button he fusses and swears for an hour, being unable tovisualize his previous actions and locate the object directly. Deficientobservation is merely a form of ignorance and responsible for the many morbidnotions and foolish ideas prevailing. There is not more than one out of everyten persons who does not believe in telepathy and other psychic manifestations,spiritualism and communion with the dead, and who would refuse to listen towilling or unwilling deceivers. Just to illustrate how deeply rooted thistendency has become even among the clear-headed American population, I maymention a comical incident.PSYCHIC PHENOMENA IN THE MANUFACTURE OF FLIVVERSShortly before the war, when the exhibition of my turbines in this city elicitedwidespread comment in the technical papers, I anticipated that there would be ascramble among manufacturers to get hold of the invention, and I had particulardesigns on that man from Detroit who has an uncanny faculty for accumulatingmillions. So confident was I that he would turn up some day, that I declaredthis as certain to my secretary and assistants. Sure enough, one fine morning abody of engineers from the Ford Motor Company presented themselves with therequest of discussing with me an important project. “Didn’t I tell you?” Iremarked triumphantly to my employees, and one of them said, “You are amazing,Mr. Tesla; everything comes out exactly as you predict.” As soon as thesehard-headed men were seated I, of course, immediately began to extol thewonderful features of my turbine, when the spokesmen interrupted me and said,“We know all about this, but we are on a special errand. We have formed apsychological society for the investigation of psychic phenomena and we want youto join us in this undertaking.” I suppose those engineers never knew how nearthey came to being fired out of my office.CONFUTING SPIRITISMEver since I was told by some of the greatest men of the time, leaders inscience whose names are immortal, that I am possesst of an unusual mind, I bentall my thinking faculties on the solution of great problems regardless ofsacrifice. For many years I endeavored to solve the enigma of death, and watchedeagerly for every kind of spiritual indication. But only once in the course ofmy existence have I had an experience which momentarily impressed me assupernatural. It was at the time of my mother’s death. I had become completelyexhausted by pain and long vigilance, and one night was carried to a buildingabout two blocks from our home. As I lay helpless there, I thought that if mymother died while I was away from her bedside she would surely give me a sign.Two or three months before I was in London in company with my late friend, SirWilliam Crookes, when spiritualism was discussed, and I was under the full swayof these thoughts. I might not have paid attention to other men, but wassusceptible to his arguments as it was his epochal work on radiant matter, whichI had read as a student, that made me embrace the electrical career. I reflectedthat the conditions for a look into the beyond were most favorable, for mymother was a woman of genius and particularly excelling in the powers ofintuition. During the whole night every fiber in my brain was strained inexpectancy, but nothing happened until early in the morning, when I fell in asleep, or perhaps a swoon, and saw a cloud carrying angelic figures of marvelousbeauty, one of whom gazed upon me lovingly and gradually assumed the features ofmy mother. The appearance slowly floated across the room and vanished, and I wasawakened by an indescribably sweet song of many voices. In that instant acertitude, which no words can express, came upon me that my mother had justdied. And that was true. I was unable to understand the tremendous weight of thepainful knowledge I received in advance, and wrote a letter to Sir WilliamCrookes while still under the domination of these impressions and in poor bodilyhealth. When I recovered I sought for a long time the external cause of thisstrange manifestation and, to my great relief, I succeeded after many months offruitless effort. I had seen the painting of a celebrated artist, representingallegorically one of the seasons in the form of a cloud with a group of angelswhich seemed to actually float in the air, and this had struck me forcefully. Itwas exactly the same that appeared in my dream, with the exception of mymother’s likeness. The music came from the choir in the church nearby at theearly mass of Easter morning, explaining everything satisfactorily in conformitywith scientific facts.This occurred long ago, and I have never had the faintest reason since to changemy views on psychical and spiritual phenomena, for which there is absolutely nofoundation. The belief in these is the natural outgrowth of intellectualdevelopment. Religious dogmas are no longer accepted in their orthodox meaning,but every individual clings to faith in a supreme power of some kind. We allmust have an ideal to govern our conduct and insure contentment, but it isimmaterial whether it be one of creed, art, science or anything else, so long asit fulfills the function of a dematerializing force. It is essential to thepeaceful existence of humanity as a whole that one common conception shouldprevail.TESLA’S ASTOUNDING DISCOVERYWhile I have failed to obtain any evidence in support of the contentions ofpsychologists and spiritualists, I have proved to my complete satisfaction theautomatism of life, not only through continuous observations of individualactions, but even more conclusively through certain generalizations. Theseamount to a discovery which I consider of the greatest moment to human society,and on which I shall briefly dwell. I got the first inkling of this astoundingtruth when I was still a very young man, but for many years I interpreted what Inoted simply as coincidences. Namely, whenever either myself or a person to whomI was attached, or a cause to which I was devoted, was hurt by others in aparticular way, which might be best popularly characterized as the most unfairimaginable, I experienced a singular and undefinable pain which, for want of abetter term, I have qualified as “cosmic,” and shortly thereafter, andinvariably, those who had inflicted it came to grief. After many such cases Iconfided this to a number of friends, who had the opportunity to convincethemselves of the truth of the theory which I have gradually formulated andwhich may be stated in the following few words:Our bodies are of similar construction and exposed to the same externalinfluences. This results in likeness of response and concordance of the generalactivities on which all our social and other rules and laws are based. We areautomata entirely controlled by the forces of the medium, being tossed aboutlike corks on the surface of the water, but mistaking the resultant of theimpulses from the outside for free will. The movements and other actions weperform are always life preservative and tho seemingly quite independent fromone another, we are connected by invisible links. So long as the organism is inperfect order it responds accurately to the agents that prompt it, but themoment that there is some derangement in any individual, his self-preservativepower is impaired. Everybody understands, of course, that if one becomes deaf,has his eyesight weakened, or his limbs injured, the chances for his continuedexistence are lessened. But this is also true, and perhaps more so, of certaindefects in the brain which deprive the automaton, more or less, of that vitalquality and cause it to rush into destruction. A very sensitive and observantbeing, with his highly developed mechanism all intact, and acting with precisionin obedience to the changing conditions of the environment, is endowed with atranscending mechanical sense, enabling him to evade perils too subtle to bedirectly perceived. When he comes in contact with others whose controllingorgans are radically faulty, that sense asserts itself and he feels the “cosmic”pain. The truth of this has been borne out in hundreds of instances and I aminviting other students of nature to devote attention to this subject, believingthat thru combined and systematic effort results of incalculable value to theworld will be attained.DR. TESLA’S FIRST AUTOMATONThe idea of constructing an automaton, to bear out my theory, presented itselfto me early but I did not begin active work until 1893, when I started mywireless investigations. During the succeeding two or three years a number ofautomatic mechanisms, to be actuated from a distance, were constructed by me andexhibited to visitors in my laboratory. In 1896, however, I designed a completemachine capable of a multitude of operations, but the consummation of my laborswas delayed until late in 1897. This machine was illustrated and described in myarticle in the Century Magazine of June, 1900, and other periodicals of thattime and, when first shown in the beginning of 1898, it created a sensation suchas no other invention of mine has ever produced. In November, 1898, a basicpatent on the novel art was granted to me, but only after the Examiner-in-Chiefhad come to New York and witnesst the performance, for what I claimed seemedunbelievable. I remember that when later I called on an official in Washington,with a view of offering the invention to the Government, he burst out inlaughter upon my telling him what I had accomplished. Nobody thought then thatthere was the faintest prospect of perfecting such a device. It is unfortunatethat in this patent, following the advice of my attorneys, I indicated thecontrol as being effected thru the medium of a single circuit and a well-knownform of detector, for the reason that I had not yet secured protection on mymethods and apparatus for individualization. As a matter of fact, my boats werecontrolled thru the joint action of several circuits and interference of everykind was excluded. Most generally I employed receiving circuits in the form ofloops, including condensers, because the discharges of my high-tensiontransmitter ionized the air in the hall so that even a very small aerial woulddraw electricity from the surrounding atmosphere for hours. Just to give anidea, I found, for instance, that a bulb 12” in diameter, highly exhausted, andwith one single terminal to which a short wire was attached, would deliver wellon to one thousand successive flashes before all charge of the air in thelaboratory was neutralized. The loop form of receiver was not sensitive to sucha disturbance and it is curious to note that it is becoming popular at this latedate. In reality it collects much less energy than the aerials or a longgrounded wire, but it so happens that it does away with a number of defectsinherent to the present wireless devices. In demonstrating my invention beforeaudiences, the visitors were requested to ask any questions, however involved,and the automaton would answer them by signs. This was considered magic at thattime but was extremely simple, for it was myself who gave the replies by meansof the device.At the same period another larger telautomatic boat was constructed, aphotograph of which is shown in this number of the ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTER. Itwas controlled by loops, having several turns placed in the hull, which was madeentirely water-tight and capable of submergence. The apparatus was similar tothat used in the first with the exception of certain special features Iintroduced as, for example, incandescent lamps which afforded a visible evidenceof the proper functioning of the machine.TELAUTOMATICS OF THE FUTUREThese automata, controlled within the range of vision of the operator, were,however, the first and rather crude steps in the evolution of the Art ofTelautomatics as I had conceived it. The next logical improvement was itsapplication to automatic mechanisms beyond the limits of vision and at greatdistance from the center of control, and I have ever since advocated theiremployment as instruments of warfare in preference to guns. The importance ofthis now seems to be recognized, if I am to judge from casual announcements thruthe press of achievements which are said to be extraordinary but contain nomerit of novelty, whatever. In an imperfect manner it is practicable, with theexisting wireless plants, to launch an aeroplane, have it follow a certainapproximate course, and perform some operation at a distance of many hundreds ofmiles. A machine of this kind can also be mechanically controlled in severalways and I have no doubt that it may prove of some usefulness in war. But thereare, to my best knowledge, no instrumentalities in existence today with whichsuch an object could be accomplished in a precise manner. I have devoted yearsof study to this matter and have evolved means, making such and greater wonderseasily realizable. As stated on a previous occasion, when I was a student atcollege I conceived a flying machine quite unlike the present ones. Theunderlying principle was sound but could not be carried into practice for wantof a prime-mover of sufficiently great activity. In recent years I havesuccessfully solved this problem and am now planning aerial machines devoid ofsustaining planes, ailerons, propellers and other external attachments, whichwill be capable of immense speeds and are very likely to furnish powerfularguments for peace in the near future. Such a machine, sustained and propelledentirely by reaction, is shown on one of the pages and is supposed to becontrolled either mechanically or by wireless energy. By installing properplants it will be practicable to project a missile of this kind into the air anddrop it almost on the very spot designated, which may be thousands of milesaway. But we are not going to stop at this. Telautomata will be ultimatelyproduced, capable of acting as if possesst of their own intelligence, and theiradvent will create a revolution. As early as 1898 I proposed to representativesof a large manufacturing concern the construction and public exhibition of anautomobile carriage which, left to itself, would perform a great variety ofoperations involving something akin to judgment. But my proposal was deemedchimerical at that time and nothing came from it.At present many of the ablest minds are trying to devise expedients forpreventing a repetition of the awful conflict which is only theoretically endedand the duration and main issues of which I have correctly predicted in anarticle printed in the Sun of December 20, 1914. The proposed League is not aremedy but, on the contrary, in the opinion of a number of competent men, maybring about results just the opposite. It is particularly regrettable that apunitive policy was adopted in framing the terms of peace, because a few yearshence it will be possible for nations to fight without armies, ships or guns, byweapons far more terrible, to the destructive action and range of which there isvirtually no limit. Any city, at a distance, whatsoever, from the enemy, can bedestroyed by him and no power on earth can stop him from doing so. If we want toavert an impending calamity and a state of things which may transform this globeinto an inferno, we should push the development of flying machines and wirelesstransmission of energy without an instant’s delay and with all the power andresources of the nation."},{"pageContent":"Other Writings"},{"pageContent":"TESLA WOULD POUR LIGHTNING FROM AIRSHIPS TO CONSUME FOEBy Dr. Nikola Tesla Inventor of Wireless Power Transmissionand Discoverer of the High Frequency,Alternating Electrical Current (In an Interview.) At this moment there is available to the belligerents in Europe an effectivemeans by which the present conflict could be brought to an abrupt terminationwithin 24 hours—and which would forever after make war an impossible thing.The various parliaments for peace which have been initiated are laudablenotions. But they are only the shadows of hope; dreams built upon a beautiful ifnot an altogether impracticable philosophy.With immeasurably less ado, with certainty and dispatch the men may be removedfrom the trenches; arbitrarily, unconditionally and probably without loss oflife—not ever again to return.WAR IS A THOUSAND INFERNOSThe means proposed to accomplish this would immediately and automaticallymaterialize reality by the application of an existent, concrete force—the brutalfact versus abstract theory.So soon as either the entente allies or the central powers should develop andadopt the invention described the war would end. To continue would result in thesure and speedy annihilation of the nations against which it might be employed.Human resistance to this terrific instrument of death and devastation would bephysically impossible. It could not be checked or combated by any means now inexistence. And it would be as irresistible as it would be effective.War is without reason or excuse; a horror greater than a thousand infernos, realor Dante-pictured. Engines of slaughter have been the creations of a war-madpeople. They are symbols of a barbaric blood lust—without the pale ofcivilization and Christianity.Yet we have wars. And as a natural accompaniment there are employed the mostimproved death-dealing machines of the age.MEN MERE PAWNS NOWIn ancient times men fought man to man, with the strength and sinews of theirarms, with skill and might of sword and lance, hand to hand. And prowess andbrawn and stamina and mastership—individual supremacy in generalship—won theirbattles, much as they are won today in the boxing ring. In modern warfare menare merely pawns, their fighting ability supplanted by the destroying capacityof machinery. And there have recently been produced such tremendous and beforeundreamed-of instruments of destruction that the world stands paralyzed withamazement and horror at the havoc they work.However, even though it seem a paradox, it remained for the nation most disposedto peace to create a yet greater agency of destruction than any thus farcontrived. Not one which merely will surpass present weapons in degree, but onewhich will out-Herod Herod in battle equipment, one which will prove anall-efficient means of widespread annihilation on a gigantic scale; againstwhich no army or nation could survive, and against which there could be offeredno adequate defense or protection.EITHER SIDE COULD END ITAnd it is now possible for either of the principals at war readily and quicklyto devise and construct an effective equipment of such destructive apparatus insufficient numbers to bring the enemy nation to cry for peace. It would makelittle or no difference as to the fact of terminating hostilities if bothfactions should equally so equip themselves at the same time, since theequipment to which I refer could not effectively be employed either in offensiveor defensive operations against similar equipment. The nation first perfectingand adopting it would have the advantage in that they would be in a position toname the terms of settlement.Practically no new thing in the arts and sciences would need to be invented orcreated for the production of such an engine of destruction. The variousfundamental elements and essential parts required in its construction alreadyare developed and generally in use. It remains only for the designer, theartisan, the electrician and the manufacturer to cooperate in producing andassembling them into a composite whole.EMPLOY AIRCRAFT FOR DEMOLITIONIt may be conceded that the bomb air raids by dirigibles thus far have failed ofdecisive results; that they have only added to the general suffering and horrorof it all. And—here is the point:These same air craft might readily be converted into means by which cities andforts and munitions factories could be reduced to beds of whitened ashes andwhich could exterminate every living thing from the face of the earth.One single demonstration of the stupendous demolition made possible by such aweapon would be all sufficient to bring the opposing forces instantly to sue forterms of peace.Although several devices might be employed for this purpose, I shall cite butone to show how readily either enemy faction could establish a method of warfarewhich would make for the immediate termination of war.A VAST INCENDIARY ARCAn airship of the gas or Zeppelin type developing 200 to 400 horsepower could beequipped with a high voltage electrical generator. For the project intendedalmost the full energy of the engines might be devoted to driving the dynamo,since the speed of the craft in operation would be a secondary consideration.From a suitable reel in electrical connection with the dynamo thin wires wouldbe lowered until their nether ends reached to within a certain distance from theground or the tops of the buildings of a city. Through these suspended wiresthere would be discharged several million volt currents of electricity.Between the lower ends of the wires and the earth there would then be formed atremendous arc, which would consume with its terrific heat not only every humanbeing and living thing, but also every building and every atom of combustiblematerial over and near which this incendiary arc should pass.The destructive radius would be at least 75 to 100 yards from the electricalgeneration of engines of, say, 200-horsepower, although with engines of500-horsepower the radius of incendiary effect might easily be 200 to 300 yards,or even more; especially if the wire area were extended by the use of stretcherbars under the airship.A highly sensitive automatic regulator controlling the reels constantly wouldadjust the length of the lowered wires to maintain a proper distance between thedischarge ends of the wire and the earth to produce and preserve anuninterrupted arc.If the craft were provided with auxiliary engines for motive power, it mighttravel with considerable speed, sweeping a path clean of every form of life andevery vestige of man’s creation. Also, such a craft could sail at a greatheight—sufficiently high, in fact, to be barely visible to the naked human eye,and certainly well beyond the range of antiaircraft guns.SURRENDER SWIFT AND FINALTwo or three such arcships side by side traveling parallel with an enemy’s lineswould leave in their wake a mass of smoldering ruins of bomb-proof trenches,supply trains. munition wagons, gun carriages, fences, homesteads and villages,and strewn through all the charred and fire-shriveled bodies of soldiers fallenhelpless before this irresistible and all-consuming force.Particularly if such an arcship raid were made at night the chances of repulsingor even reaching the enemy fleet would be practically nil.No sane government would hesitate about flying the white flag in face of such agrewsome cataclysm. Surrender, swift and final, would be the only humanalternative.BURNING HELPLESS WOMENMoving in squadrons or line abreast, a fleet of these aircraft could sweep overlarge cities, even such as London, Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Rome, Petrograd orConstantinople, and leave them a blackened, smoking and lifeless ruin.Perhaps not even the most war-crazed power ever would venture such animmeasurable and unpardonable outrage against mankind, involving as it would theburning of helpless women and children and noncombatants.And yet such heinous offenses against civilization and the once recognized rulesof war have been and still are being committed. Even though it be on aninsignificant scale as compared with the possibilities of the device suggestedfor the arc craft, yet one may not forget that such incendiary raids are beingcarried on to the limit of the means thus far developed. What they might attemptwith more destructive agencies is seriously open to question.THE HUMANITARIAN SIDEHowever, it is largely due to the fact that the aerial raids with presentequipment do not make for decisive results that the powers continue to toleratesuch revolting tactics of warfare, electing to take the gambler’s chance ofescape in future.But—and this is the humanitarian side to this suggested engine ofannihilation—if either belligerent should equip and place in active service aneffective fleet of these arc-producing, incendiary air craft and should make dueannouncement to enemy nations of a proposed raid upon its cities or its forcesin the field, such an act would be equivalent to serving notice of a demand forsurrender—and beyond peradventure it would promptly and unconditionally beaccepted."},{"pageContent":"THE ACTION OF THE EYEIt can be taken as a fact, which the theory of the action of the eye implies,that, for each external impression, that is, for each image produced on theretina, the ends of the visual nerves concerned in the conveyance of theimpression to the mind, must be under a peculiar stress or in a vibratory state.It now does not seem improbable that, when by the power of thought an image isevoked, a distant reflex action, no matter how weak, is exerted upon certainends of the visual nerves, and, therefore, upon the retina. Will it ever bewithin human power to analyze the condition of the retina when disturbed bythought or reflex action, by the help of some optical or other means of suchsensitiveness that a clear idea of its state might be gained at any time? Ifthis were possible, then the problem of reading one’s thoughts with precision,like the characters of an open book, might be much easier to solve than manyproblems belonging to the domain of positive physical science, in the solutionof which many, if not the majority, of scientific men implicitly believe.Helmholtz has shown that the fundi of the eyes are themselves luminous, and hewas able to see, in total darkness, the movement of his arm by the light of hisown eyes. This is one of the most remarkable experiments recorded in the historyof science, and probably only a few men could satisfactorily repeat it, for itis very likely that the luminosity of the eyes is associated with uncommonactivity of the brain and great imaginative power. It is fluorescence of brainaction, as it were.Another fact having a bearing on this subject which has probably been noted bymany, since it is stated in popular expressions, but which I cannot recollect tohave found chronicled as a positive result of observation, is, that at times,when a sudden idea or image presents itself to the intellect, there is adistinct and sometimes painful sensation of luminosity produced in the eye,observable even in broad day-light.Two facts about the eye must forcibly impress the mind of the physicist,notwithstanding he may think or say that it is an imperfect optical instrument,forgetting that the very conception of that which is perfect or seems so to him,has been gained through this same instrument. Firstly, the eye is, as far as ourpositive knowledge goes, the only organ which is directly affected by thatsubtile medium, which, as science teaches us, must fill all space; secondly, itis the most sensitive of our organs, incomparably more sensitive to externalimpressions than any other.This divine organ of sight, this indispensable instrument for thought and allintellectual enjoyment, which lays open to us the marvels of this universe,through which we have acquired what knowledge we possess, and which prompts usto and controls all our physical and mental activity,—by what is it affected? Bylight! What is light?It is beyond the scope of my lecture to dwell upon the subject of light ingeneral, my object being merely to bring presently to your notice a certainclass of light effects and a number of phenomena observed in pursuing the studyof these effects. But to be consistent in my remarks it is necessary to statethat according to the idea now accepted by the majority of scientific men as apositive result of theoretical and experimental investigation, the various formsof manifestation of energy which were generally designated as “electric,” ormoreprecisely “electro-magnetic,” are energy manifestations of the same nature asthose of radiant heat and light. Therefore the phenomena of light and heat, andothers besides these, may be called electrical phenomena. Thus electricalscience has become the mother science of all, and its study has becomeall-important. The day when we shall know exactly what “electricity” is, willchronicle an event probably greater and more important than any other recordedin the history of the human race."},{"pageContent":"THE PROBLEM OF INCREASING HUMAN ENERGYWith Special Reference to the Harnessing of the Sun’s EnergyTHE ONWARD MOVEMENT OF MAN—THE ENERGY OF THE MOVEMENT—THE THREE WAYS OFINCREASING HUMAN ENERGYOf all the endless variety of phenomena which nature presents to our senses,there is none that fills our minds with greater wonder than that inconceivablycomplex movement which, in its entirety, we designate as human life. Itsmysterious origin is veiled in the forever impenetrable mist of the past, itscharacter is rendered incomprehensible by its infinite intricacy, and itsdestination is hidden in the unfathomable depths of the future. Whence does itcome? What is it? Whither does it tend? are the great questions which the sagesof all times have endeavored to answer.Modern science says: The sun is the past, the earth is the present, the moon isthe future. From an incandescent mass we have originated, and into a frozen masswe shall turn. Merciless is the law of nature, and rapidly and irresistibly weare drawn to our doom. Lord Kelvin, in his profound meditations, allows us onlya short span of life, something like six million years, after which time thesun’s bright light will have ceased to shine, and its life-giving heat will haveebbed away, and our own earth will be a lump of ice, hurrying on through theeternal night. But do not let us despair. There will still be left on it aglimmering spark of life, and there will be a chance to kindle a new fire onsome distant star. This wonderful possibility seems, indeed, to exist, judgingfrom Professor Dewar’s beautiful experiments with liquid air, which show thatgerms of organic life are not destroyed by cold, no matter how intense;consequently they may be transmitted through the interstellar space. Meanwhilethe cheering lights of science and art, ever increasing in intensity, illuminateour path, and the marvels they disclose, and the enjoyments they offer, make usmeasurably forgetful of the gloomy future.Though we may never be able to comprehend human life, we know certainly that itis a movement, of whatever nature it be. The existence of a movement unavoidablyimplies a body which is being moved and a force which is moving it. Hence,wherever there is life, there is a mass moved by a force. All mass possessesinertia, all force tends to persist. Owing to this universal property andcondition, a body, be it at rest or in motion, tends to remain in the samestate, and a force, manifesting itself anywhere and through whatever cause,produces an equivalent opposing force, and as an absolute necessity of this itfollows that every movement in nature must be rhythmical. Long ago this simpletruth was clearly pointed out by Herbert Spencer, who arrived at it through asomewhat different process of reasoning. It is borne out in everything weperceive—in the movement of a planet, in the surging and ebbing of the tide, inthe reverberations of the air, the swinging of a pendulum, the oscillations ofan electric current, and in the infinitely varied phenomena of organic life.Does not the whole of human life attest it? Birth, growth, old age, and death ofan individual, family, race, or nation, what is it all but a rhythm? Alllife-manifestation, then, even in its most intricate form, as exemplified inman, however involved and inscrutable, is only a movement, to which the samegeneral laws of movement which govern throughout the physical universe must beapplicable.When we speak of man, we have a conception of humanity as a whole, and beforeapplying scientific methods to the investigation of his movement, we must acceptthis as a physical fact. But can any one doubt to-day that all the millions ofindividuals and all the innumerable types and characters constitute an entity, aunit? Though free to think and act, we are held together, like the stars in thefirmament, with ties inseparable. These ties we cannot see, but we can feelthem. I cut myself in the finger, and it pains me: this finger is a part of me.I see a friend hurt, and it hurts me, too: my friend and I are one. And now Isee stricken down an enemy, a lump of matter which, of all the lumps of matterin the universe, I care least for, and still it grieves me. Does this not provethat each of us is only a part of a whole?For ages this idea has been proclaimed in the consummately wise teachings ofreligion, probably not alone as a means of insuring peace and harmony among men,but as a deeply founded truth. The Buddhist expresses it in one way, theChristian in another, but both say the same: We are all one. Metaphysical proofsare, however, not the only ones which we are able to bring forth in support ofthis idea. Science, too, recognizes this connectedness of separate individuals,though not quite in the same sense as it admits that the suns, planets, andmoons of a constellation are one body, and there can be no doubt that it will beexperimentally confirmed in times to come, when our means and methods forinvestigating psychical and other states and phenomena shall have been broughtto great perfection. Still more: this one human being lives on and on. Theindividual is ephemeral, races and nations come and pass away, but man remains.Therein lies the profound difference between the individual and the whole.Therein, too, is to be found the partial explanation of many of those marvelousphenomena of heredity which are the result of countless centuries of feeble butpersistent influence.Conceive, then, man as a mass urged on by a force. Though this movement is notof a translatory character, implying change of place, yet the general laws ofmechanical movement are applicable to it, and the energy associated with thismass can be measured, in accordance with well-known principles, by half theproduct of the mass with the square of a certain velocity. So, for instance, acannon-ball which is at rest possesses a certain amount of energy in the form ofheat, which we measure in a similar way. We imagine the ball to consist ofinnumerable minute particles, called atoms or molecules, which vibrate or whirlaround one another. We determine their masses and velocities, and from them theenergy of each of these minute systems, and adding them all together, we get anidea of the total heat-energy contained in the ball, which is only seemingly atrest. In this purely theoretical estimate this energy may then be calculated bymultiplying half of the total mass—that is, half of the sum of all the smallmasses—with the square of a velocity which is determined from the velocities ofthe separate particles. In like manner we may conceive of human energy beingmeasured by half the human mass multiplied with the square of a velocity whichwe are not yet able to compute. But our deficiency in this knowledge will notvitiate the truth of the deductions I shall draw, which rest on the firm basisthat the same laws of mass and force govern throughout nature.Man, however, is not an ordinary mass, consisting of spinning atoms andmolecules, and containing merely heat-energy. He is a mass possessed of certainhigher qualities by reason of the creative principle of life with which he isendowed. His mass, as the water in an ocean wave, is being continuouslyexchanged, new taking the place of the old. Not only this, but he grows,propagates, and dies, thus altering his mass independently, both in bulk anddensity. What is most wonderful of all, he is capable of increasing ordiminishing his velocity of movement by the mysterious power he possesses ofappropriating more or less energy from other substance, and turning it intomotive energy. But in any given moment we may ignore these slow changes andassume that human energy is measured by half the product of man’s mass with thesquare of a certain hypothetical velocity. However we may compute this velocity,and whatever we may take as the standard of its measure, we must, in harmonywith this conception, come to the conclusion that the great problem of scienceis, and always will be, to increase the energy thus defined. Many years ago,stimulated by the perusal of that deeply interesting work, Draper’s “History ofthe Intellectual Development of Europe,” depicting so vividly human movement, Irecognized that to solve this eternal problem must ever be the chief task of theman of science. Some results of my own efforts to this end I shall endeavorbriefly to describe here.Let, then, in diagram a, M represent the mass of man. This mass is impelled inone direction by a force f, which is resisted by another partly frictional andpartly negative force R, acting in a direction exactly opposite, and retardingthe movement of the mass. Such an antagonistic force is present in everymovement, and must be taken into consideration. The difference between these twoforces is the effective force which imparts a velocity V to the mass M in thedirection of the arrow on the line representing the force f. In accordance withthe preceding, the human energy will then be given by the product ½ MV 2 = ½ MV× V, in which M is the total mass of man in the ordinary interpretation of theterm “mass,” and V is a certain hypothetical velocity, which, in the presentstate of science, we are unable exactly to define and determine. To increase thehuman energy is, therefore, equivalent to increasing this product, and thereare, as will readily be seen, only three ways possible to attain this result,which are illustrated in the above diagram. The first way, shown in the topfigure, is to increase the mass (as indicated by the dotted circle), leaving thetwo opposing forces the same. The second way is to reduce the retarding force Rto a smaller value r, leaving the mass and the impelling force the same, asdiagrammatically shown in the middle figure. The third way, which is illustratedin the last figure, is to increase the impelling force f to a higher value F,while the mass and the retarding force R remain unaltered. Evidently fixedlimits exist as regards increase of mass and reduction of retarding force, butthe impelling force can be increased indefinitely. Each of these three possiblesolutions presents a different aspect of the main problem of increasing humanenergy, which is thus divided into three distinct problems, to be successivelyconsidered.THE FIRST PROBLEM: HOW TO INCREASE THE HUMAN MASS—THE BURNING OF ATMOSPHERICNITROGEN.Viewed generally, there are obviously two ways of increasing the mass ofmankind: first, by aiding and maintaining those forces and conditions which tendto increase it; and, second, by opposing and reducing those which tend todiminish it. The mass will be increased by careful attention to health, bysubstantial food, by moderation, by regularity of habits, by the promotion ofmarriage, by conscientious attention to the children, and, generally stated, bythe observance of all the many precepts and laws of religion and hygiene. But inadding new mass to the old, three cases again present themselves. Either themass added is of the same velocity as the old, or it is of a smaller or of ahigher velocity. To gain an idea of the relative importance of these cases,imagine a train composed of, say, one hundred locomotives running on a track,and suppose that, to increase the energy of the moving mass, four morelocomotives are added to the train. If these four move at the same velocity atwhich the train is going, the total energy will be increased four per cent.; ifthey are moving at only one half of that velocity, the increase will amount toonly one per cent.; if they are moving at twice that velocity, the increase ofenergy will be sixteen per cent. This simple illustration shows that it is ofthe greatest importance to add mass of a higher velocity. Stated more to thepoint, if, for example, the children be of the same degree of enlightenment asthe parents,—that is, mass of the “same velocity,”—the energy will simplyincrease proportionately to the number added. If they are less intelligent oradvanced, or mass of “smaller velocity,” there will be a very slight gain in theenergy; but if they are further advanced, or mass of “higher velocity,” then thenew generation will add very considerably to the sum total of human energy. Anyaddition of mass of “smaller velocity,” beyond that indispensable amountrequired by the law expressed in the proverb, “Mens sana in corpore sano,”should be strenuously opposed. For instance, the mere development of muscle, asaimed at in some of our colleges, I consider equivalent to adding mass of“smaller velocity,” and I would not commend it, although my views were differentwhen I was a student myself. Moderate exercise, insuring the right balancebetween mind and body, and the highest efficiency of performance, is, of course,a prime requirement. The above example shows that the most important result tobe attained is the education, or the increase of the “velocity,” of the massnewly added.Conversely, it scarcely need be stated that everything that is against theteachings of religion and the laws of hygiene is tending to decrease the mass.Whisky, wine, tea, coffee, tobacco, and other such stimulants are responsiblefor the shortening of the lives of many, and ought to be used with moderation.But I do not think that rigorous measures of suppression of habits followedthrough many generations are commendable. It is wiser to preach moderation thanabstinence. We have become accustomed to these stimulants, and if such reformsare to be effected, they must be slow and gradual. Those who are devoting theirenergies to such ends could make themselves far more useful by turning theirefforts in other directions, as, for instance, toward providing pure water.For every person who perishes from the effects of a stimulant, at least athousand die from the consequences of drinking impure water. This preciousfluid, which daily infuses new life into us, is likewise the chief vehiclethrough which disease and death enter our bodies. The germs of destruction itconveys are enemies all the more terrible as they perform their fatal workunperceived. They seal our doom while we live and enjoy. The majority of peopleare so ignorant or careless in drinking water, and the consequences of this areso disastrous, that a philanthropist can scarcely use his efforts better than byendeavoring to enlighten those who are thus injuring themselves. By systematicpurification and sterilization of the drinking-water the human mass would bevery considerably increased. It should be made a rigid rule—which might beenforced by law—to boil or to sterilize otherwise the drinking-water in everyhousehold and public place. The mere filtering does not afford sufficientsecurity against infection. All ice for internal uses should be artificiallyprepared from water thoroughly sterilized. The importance of eliminating germsof disease from the city water is generally recognized, but little is being doneto improve the existing conditions, as no satisfactory method of sterilizinggreat quantities of water has as yet been brought forward. By improvedelectrical appliances we are now enabled to produce ozone cheaply and in largeamounts, and this ideal disinfectant seems to offer a happy solution of theimportant question.Gambling, business rush, and excitement, particularly on the exchanges, arecauses of much mass-reduction, all the more so because the individuals concernedrepresent units of higher value. Incapacity of observing the first symptoms ofan illness, and careless neglect of the same, are important factors ofmortality. In noting carefully every new sign of approaching danger, and makingconscientiously every possible effort to avert it, we are not only followingwise laws of hygiene in the interest of our well-being and the success of ourlabors, but we are also complying with a higher moral duty. Every one shouldconsider his body as a priceless gift from one whom he loves above all, as amarvelous work of art, of undescribable beauty and mastery beyond humanconception, and so delicate and frail that a word, a breath, a look, nay, athought, may injure it. Uncleanliness, which breeds disease and death, is notonly a self-destructive but a highly immoral habit. In keeping our bodies freefrom infection, healthful, and pure, we are expressing our reverence for thehigh principle with which they are endowed. He who follows the precepts ofhygiene in this spirit is proving himself, so far, truly religious. Laxity ofmorals is a terrible evil, which poisons both mind and body, and which isresponsible for a great reduction of the human mass in some countries. Many ofthe present customs and tendencies are productive of similar hurtful results.For example, the society life, modern education and pursuits of women, tendingto draw them away from their household duties and make men out of them, mustneeds detract from the elevating ideal they represent, diminish the artisticcreative power, and cause sterility and a general weakening of the race. Athousand other evils might be mentioned, but all put together, in their bearingupon the problem under discussion, they would not equal a single one, the wantof food, brought on by poverty, destitution, and famine. Millions of individualsdie yearly for want of food, thus keeping down the mass. Even in our enlightenedcommunities, and notwithstanding the many charitable efforts, this is still, inall probability, the chief evil. I do not mean here absolute want of food, butwant of healthful nutriment.How to provide good and plentiful food is, therefore, a most important questionof the day. On general principles the raising of cattle as a means of providingfood is objectionable, because, in the sense interpreted above, it mustundoubtedly tend to the addition of mass of a “smaller velocity.” It iscertainly preferable to raise vegetables, and I think, therefore, thatvegetarianism is a commendable departure from the established barbarous habit.That we can subsist on plant food and perform our work even to advantage is nota theory, but a well-demonstrated fact. Many races living almost exclusively onvegetables are of superior physique and strength. There is no doubt that someplant food, such as oatmeal, is more economical than meat, and superior to it inregard to both mechanical and mental performance. Such food, moreover, taxes ourdigestive organs decidedly less, and, in making us more contented and sociable,produces an amount of good difficult to estimate. In view of these facts everyeffort should be made to stop the wanton and cruel slaughter of animals, whichmust be destructive to our morals. To free ourselves from animal instincts andappetites, which keep us down, we should begin at the very root from which theyspring: we should effect a radical reform in the character of the food.There seems to be no philosophical necessity for food. We can conceive oforganized beings living without nourishment, and deriving all the energy theyneed for the performance of their life-functions from the ambient medium. In acrystal we have the clear evidence of the existence of a formativelife-principle, and though we cannot understand the life of a crystal, it isnone the less a living being. There may be, besides crystals, other suchindividualized, material systems of beings, perhaps of gaseous constitution, orcomposed of substance still more tenuous. In view of this possibility,—nay,probability,—we cannot apodictically deny the existence of organized beings on aplanet merely because the conditions on the same are unsuitable for theexistence of life as we conceive it. We cannot even, with positive assurance,assert that some of them might not be present here, in this our world, in thevery midst of us, for their constitution and life-manifestation may be such thatwe are unable to perceive them.The production of artificial food as a means for causing an increase of thehuman mass naturally suggests itself, but a direct attempt of this kind toprovide nourishment does not appear to me rational, at least not for thepresent. Whether we could thrive on such food is very doubtful. We are theresult of ages of continuous adaptation, and we cannot radically change withoutunforeseen and, in all probability, disastrous consequences. So uncertain anexperiment should not be tried. By far the best way, it seems to me, to meet theravages of the evil, would be to find ways of increasing the productivity of thesoil. With this object the preservation of forests is of an importance whichcannot be overestimated, and in this connection, also, the utilization ofwaterpower for purposes of electrical transmission, dispensing in many ways withthe necessity of burning wood, and tending thereby to forest preservation, is tobe strongly advocated. But there are limits in the improvement to be effected inthis and similar ways.To increase materially the productivity of the soil, it must be more effectivelyfertilized by artificial means. The question of food-production resolves itself,then, into the question how best to fertilize the soil. What it is that made thesoil is still a mystery. To explain its origin is probably equivalent toexplaining the origin of life itself. The rocks, disintegrated by moisture andheat and wind and weather, were in themselves not capable of maintaining life.Some unexplained condition arose, and some new principle came into effect, andthe first layer capable of sustaining low organisms, like mosses, was formed.These, by their life and death, added more of the life-sustaining quality to thesoil, and higher organisms could then subsist, and so on and on, until at lasthighly developed plant and animal life could flourish. But though the theoriesare, even now, not in agreement as to how fertilization is effected, it is afact, only too well ascertained, that the soil cannot indefinitely sustain life,and some way must be found to supply it with the substances which have beenabstracted from it by the plants. The chief and most valuable among thesesubstances are compounds of nitrogen, and the cheap production of these is,therefore, the key for the solution of the all-important food problem. Ouratmosphere contains an inexhaustible amount of nitrogen, and could we butoxidize it and produce these compounds, an incalculable benefit for mankindwould follow.Long ago this idea took a powerful hold on the imagination of scientific men,but an efficient means for accomplishing this result could not be devised. Theproblem was rendered extremely difficult by the extraordinary inertness of thenitrogen, which refuses to combine even with oxygen. But here electricity comesto our aid: the dormant affinities of the element are awakened by an electriccurrent of the proper quality. As a lump of coal which has been in contact withoxygen for centuries without burning will combine with it when once ignited, sonitrogen, excited by electricity, will burn. I did not succeed, however, inproducing electrical discharges exciting very effectively the atmosphericnitrogen until a comparatively recent date, although I showed, in May, 1891, ina scientific lecture, a novel form of discharge or electrical flame named “St.Elmo’s hotfire,” which, besides being capable of generating ozone in abundance,also possessed, as I pointed out on that occasion, distinctly the quality ofexciting chemical affinities. This discharge or flame was then only three orfour inches long, its chemical action was likewise very feeble, and consequentlythe process of oxidation of the nitrogen was wasteful. How to intensify thisaction was the question. Evidently electric currents of a peculiar kind had tobe produced in order to render the process of nitrogen combustion moreefficient.The first advance was made in ascertaining that the chemical activity of thedischarge was very considerably increased by using currents of extremely highfrequency or rate of vibration. This was an important improvement, but practicalconsiderations soon set a definite limit to the progress in this direction.Next, the effects of the electrical pressure of the current impulses, of theirwave-form and other characteristic features, were investigated. Then theinfluence of the atmospheric pressure and temperature and of the presence ofwater and other bodies was studied, and thus the best conditions for causing themost intense chemical action of the discharge and securing the highestefficiency of the process were gradually ascertained. Naturally, theimprovements were not quick in coming; still, little by little, I advanced. Theflame grew larger and larger, and its oxidizing action more and more intense.From an insignificant brush-discharge a few inches long it developed into amarvelous electrical phenomenon, a roaring blaze, devouring the nitrogen of theatmosphere and measuring sixty or seventy feet across. Thus slowly, almostimperceptibly, possibility became accomplishment. All is not yet done, by anymeans, but to what a degree my efforts have been rewarded an idea may be gainedfrom an inspection of Fig. 1, which, with its title, is self-explanatory. Theflame-like discharge visible is produced by the intense electrical oscillationswhich pass through the coil shown, and violently agitate the electrifiedmolecules of the air. By this means a strong affinity is created between the twonormally indifferent constituents of the atmosphere, and they combine readily,even if no further provision is made for intensifying the chemical action of thedischarge. In the manufacture of nitrogen compounds by this method, of course,every possible means bearing upon the intensity of this action and theefficiency of the process will be taken advantage of, and, besides, specialarrangements will be provided for the fixation of the compounds formed, as theyare generally unstable, the nitrogen becoming again inert after a little lapseof time. Steam is a simple and effective means for fixing permanently thecompounds. The result illustrated makes it practicable to oxidize theatmospheric nitrogen in unlimited quantities, merely by the use of cheapmechanical power and simple electrical apparatus. In this manner many compoundsof nitrogen may be manufactured all over the world, at a small cost, and in anydesired amount, and by means of these compounds the soil can be fertilized andits productiveness indefinitely increased. An abundance of cheap and healthfulfood, not artificial, but such as we are accustomed to, may thus be obtained:This new and inexhaustible source of food-supply will be of incalculable benefitto mankind, for it will enormously contribute to the increase of the human mass,and thus add immensely to human energy. Soon, I hope, the world will see thebeginning of an industry which, in time to come, will, I believe, be inimportance next to that of iron.THE SECOND PROBLEM: HOW TO REDUCE THE FORCE RETARDING THE HUMAN MASS—THE ART OFTELAUTOMATICS.As before stated, the force which retards the onward movement of man is partlyfrictional and partly negative. To illustrate this distinction I may name, forexample, ignorance, stupidity, and imbecility as some of the purely frictionalforces, or resistances devoid of any directive tendency. On the other hand,visionariness, insanity, self-destructive tendency, religious fanaticism, andthe like, are all forces of a negative character, acting in definite directions.To reduce or entirely to overcome these dissimilar retarding forces, radicallydifferent methods must be employed. One knows, for instance, what a fanatic maydo, and one can take preventive measures, can enlighten, convince, and possiblydirect him, turn his vice into virtue; but one does not know, and never canknow, what a brute or an imbecile may do, and one must deal with him as with amass, inert, without mind, let loose by the mad elements. A negative forcealways implies some quality, not infrequently a high one, though badly directed,which it is possible to turn to good advantage; but a directionless, frictionalforce involves unavoidable loss. Evidently, then, the first and general answerto the above question is: turn all negative force in the right direction andreduce all frictional force.There can be no doubt that, of all the frictional resistances, the one that mostretards human movement is ignorance. Not without reason said that man of wisdom,Buddha: “Ignorance is the greatest evil in the world.” The friction whichresults from ignorance, and which is greatly increased owing to the numerouslanguages and nationalities, can be reduced only by the spread of knowledge andthe unification of the heterogeneous elements of humanity. No effort could bebetter spent. But however ignorance may have retarded the onward movement of manin times past, it is certain that, nowadays, negative forces have become ofgreater importance. Among these there is one of far greater moment than anyother. It is called organized warfare. When we consider the millions ofindividuals, often the ablest in mind and body, the flower of humanity, who arecompelled to a life of inactivity and unproductiveness, the immense sums ofmoney daily required for the maintenance of armies and war apparatus,representing ever so much of human energy, all the effort uselessly spent in theproduction of arms and implements of destruction, the loss of life and thefostering of a barbarous spirit, we are appalled at the inestimable loss tomankind which the existence of these deplorable conditions must involve. Whatcan we do to combat best this great evil?Law and order absolutely require the maintenance of organized force. Nocommunity can exist and prosper without rigid discipline. Every country must beable to defend itself, should the necessity arise. The conditions of to-day arenot the result of yesterday, and a radical change cannot be effected to-morrow.If the nations would at once disarm, it is more than likely that a state ofthings worse than war itself would follow. Universal peace is a beautiful dream,but not at once realizable. We have seen recently that even the noble effort ofthe man invested with the greatest worldly power has been virtually withouteffect. And no wonder, for the establishment of universal peace is, for the timebeing, a physical impossibility. War is a negative force, and cannot be turnedin a positive direction without passing through the intermediate phases. It isthe problem of making a wheel, rotating one way, turn in the opposite directionwithout slowing it down, stopping it, and speeding it up again the other way.It has been argued that the perfection of guns of great destructive power willstop warfare. So I myself thought for a long time, but now I believe this to bea profound mistake. Such developments will greatly modify, but not arrest it. Onthe contrary, I think that every new arm that is invented, every new departurethat is made in this direction, merely invites new talent and skill, engages neweffort, offers a new incentive, and so only gives a fresh impetus to furtherdevelopment. Think of the discovery of gunpowder. Can we conceive of any moreradical departure than was effected by this innovation? Let us imagine ourselvesliving in that period: would we not have thought then that warfare was at anend, when the armor of the knight became an object of ridicule, when bodilystrength and skill, meaning so much before, became of comparatively littlevalue? Yet gunpowder did not stop warfare; quite the opposite—it acted as a mostpowerful incentive. Nor do I believe that warfare can ever be arrested by anyscientific or ideal development, so long as similar conditions to those nowprevailing exist, because war has itself become a science, and because warinvolves some of the most sacred sentiments of which man is capable. In fact, itis doubtful whether men who would not be ready to fight for a high principlewould be good for anything at all. It is not the mind which makes man, nor is itthe body; it is mind and body. Our virtues and our failings are inseparable,like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more.Another argument, which carries considerable force, is frequently made, namely,that war must soon become impossible because the means of defense areoutstripping the means of attack. This is only in accordance with a fundamentallaw which may be expressed by the statement that it is easier to destroy than tobuild. This law defines human capacities and human conditions. Were these suchthat it would be easier to build than to destroy, man would go on unresisted,creating and accumulating without limit. Such conditions are not of this earth.A being which could do this would not be a man; it might be a god. Defense willalways have the advantage over attack, but this alone, it seems to me, can neverstop war. By the use of new principles of defense we can render harborsimpregnable against attack, but we cannot by such means prevent two war-shipsmeeting in battle on the high sea. And then, if we follow this idea to itsultimate development, we are led to the conclusion that it would be better formankind if attack and defense were just oppositely related; for if everycountry, even the smallest, could surround itself with a wall absolutelyimpenetrable, and could defy the rest of the world, a state of things wouldsurely be brought on which would be extremely unfavorable to human progress. Itis by abolishing all the barriers which separate nations and countries thatcivilization is best furthered.Again, it is contended by some that the advent of the flying-machine must bringon universal peace. This, too, I believe to be an entirely erroneous view. Theflying-machine is certainly coming, and very soon, but the conditions willremain the same as before. In fact, I see no reason why a ruling power, likeGreat Britain, might not govern the air as well as the sea. Without wishing toput myself on record as a prophet, I do not hesitate to say that the next yearswill see the establishment of an “air-power,” and its center may not be far fromNew York. But, for all that, men will fight on merrily.The ideal development of the war principle would ultimately lead to thetransformation of the whole energy of war into purely potential, explosiveenergy, like that of an electrical condenser. In this form the war-energy couldbe maintained without effort; it would need to be much smaller in amount, whileincomparably more effective.As regards the security of a country against foreign invasion, it is interestingto note that it depends only on the relative, and not on the absolute, number ofthe individuals or magnitude of the forces, and that, if every country shouldreduce the war-force in the same ratio, the security would remain unaltered. Aninternational agreement with the object of reducing to a minimum the war-forcewhich, in view of the present still imperfect education of the masses, isabsolutely indispensable, would, therefore, seem to be the first rational stepto take toward diminishing the force retarding human movement.Fortunately, the existing conditions cannot continue indefinitely, for a newelement is beginning to assert itself. A change for the better is imminent, andI shall now endeavor to show what, according to my ideas, will be the firstadvance toward the establishment of peaceful relations between nations, and bywhat means it will eventually be accomplished.Let us go back to the early beginning, when the law of the stronger was the onlylaw. The light of reason was not yet kindled, and the weak was entirely at themercy of the strong. The weak individual then began to learn how to defendhimself. He made use of a club, stone, spear, sling, or bow and arrow, and inthe course of time, instead of physical strength, intelligence became the chiefdeciding factor in the battle. The wild character was gradually softened by theawakening of noble sentiments, and so, imperceptibly, after ages of continuedprogress, we have come from the brutal fight of the unreasoning animal to whatwe call the “civilized warfare” of to-day, in which the combatants shake hands,talk in a friendly way, and smoke cigars in the entr’actes, ready to engageagain in deadly conflict at a signal. Let pessimists say what they like, here isan absolute evidence of great and gratifying advance.But now, what is the next phase in this evolution? Not peace as yet, by anymeans. The next change which should naturally follow from modern developmentsshould be the continuous diminution of the number of individuals engaged inbattle. The apparatus will be one of specifically great power, but only a fewindividuals will be required to operate it. This evolution will bring more andmore into prominence a machine or mechanism with the fewest individuals as anelement of warfare, and the absolutely unavoidable consequence of this will bethe abandonment of large, clumsy, slowly moving, and unmanageable units.Greatest possible speed and maximum rate of energy-delivery by the war apparatuswill be the main object. The loss of life will become smaller and smaller, andfinally, the number of the individuals continuously diminishing, merely machineswill meet in a contest without bloodshed, the nations being simply interested,ambitious spectators. When this happy condition is realized, peace will beassured. But, no matter to what degree of perfection rapid-fire guns, high-powercannon, explosive projectiles, torpedo-boats, or other implements of war may bebrought, no matter how destructive they may be made, that condition can never bereached through any such development. All such implements require men for theiroperation; men are indispensable parts of the machinery. Their object is to killand to destroy. Their power resides in their capacity for doing evil. So long asmen meet in battle, there will be bloodshed. Bloodshed will ever keep upbarbarous passion. To break this fierce spirit, a radical departure must bemade, an entirely new principle must be introduced, something that never existedbefore in warfare—a principle which will forcibly, unavoidably, turn the battleinto a mere spectacle, a play, a contest without loss of blood. To bring on thisresult men must be dispensed with: machine must fight machine. But howaccomplish that which seems impossible? The answer is simple enough: produce amachine capable of acting as though it were part of a human being—no meremechanical contrivance, comprising levers, screws, wheels, clutches, and nothingmore, but a machine embodying a higher principle, which will enable it toperform its duties as though it had intelligence, experience, reason, judgment,a mind! This conclusion is the result of my thoughts and observations which haveextended through virtually my whole life, and I shall now briefly describe how Icame to accomplish that which at first seemed an unrealizable dream.A long time ago, when I was a boy, I was afflicted with a singular trouble,which seems to have been due to an extraordinary excitability of the retina. Itwas the appearance of images which, by their persistence, marred the vision ofreal objects and interfered with thought. When a word was said to me, the imageof the object which it designated would appear vividly before my eyes, and manytimes it was impossible for me to tell whether the object I saw was real or not.This caused me great discomfort and anxiety, and I tried hard to free myself ofthe spell. But for a long time I tried in vain, and it was not, as I stillclearly recollect, until I was about twelve years old that I succeeded for thefirst time, by an effort of the will, in banishing an image which presenteditself. My happiness will never be as complete as it was then, but,unfortunately (as I thought at that time), the old trouble returned, and with itmy anxiety. Here it was that the observations to which I refer began. I noted,namely, that whenever the image of an object appeared before my eyes I had seensomething which reminded me of it. In the first instances I thought this to bepurely accidental, but soon I convinced myself that it was not so. A visualimpression, consciously or unconsciously received, invariably preceded theappearance of the image. Gradually the desire arose in me to find out, everytime, what caused the images to appear, and the satisfaction of this desire soonbecame a necessity. The next observation I made was that, just as these imagesfollowed as a result of something I had seen, so also the thoughts which Iconceived were suggested in like manner. Again, I experienced the same desire tolocate the image which caused the thought, and this search for the originalvisual impression soon grew to be a second nature. My mind became automatic, asit were, and in the course of years of continued, almost unconsciousperformance, I acquired the ability of locating every time and, as a rule,instantly the visual impression which started the thought. Nor is this all. Itwas not long before I was aware that also all my movements were prompted in thesame way, and so, searching, observing, and verifying continuously, year afteryear, I have, by every thought and every act of mine, demonstrated, and do sodaily, to my absolute satisfaction, that I am an automaton endowed with power ofmovement, which merely responds to external stimuli beating upon my senseorgans, and thinks and acts and moves accordingly. I remember only one or twocases in all my life in which I was unable to locate the first impression whichprompted a movement or a thought, or even a dream.With these experiences it was only natural that, long ago, I conceived the ideaof constructing an automaton which would mechanically represent me, and whichwould respond, as I do myself, but, of course, in a much more primitive manner,to external influences. Such an automaton evidently had to have motive power,organs for locomotion, directive organs, and one or more sensitive organs soadapted as to be excited by external stimuli. This machine would, I reasoned,perform its movements in the manner of a living being, for it would have all thechief mechanical characteristics or elements of the same. There was still thecapacity for growth, propagation, and, above all, the mind which would bewanting to make the model complete. But growth was not necessary in this case,since a machine could be manufactured full-grown, so to speak. As to thecapacity for propagation, it could likewise be left out of consideration, for inthe mechanical model it merely signified a process of manufacture. Whether theautomaton be of flesh and bone, or of wood and steel, it mattered little,provided it could perform all the duties required of it like an intelligentbeing. To do so, it had to have an element corresponding to the mind, whichwould effect the control of all its movements and operations, and cause it toact, in any unforeseen case that might present itself, with knowledge, reason,judgment, and experience. But this element I could easily embody in it byconveying to it my own intelligence, my own understanding. So this invention wasevolved, and so a new art came into existence, for which the name“telautomatics” has been suggested, which means the art of controlling themovements and operations of distant automatons.This principle evidently was applicable to any kind of machine that moves onland or in the water or in the air. In applying it practically for the firsttime, I selected a boat (see Fig. 2). A storage battery placed within itfurnished the motive power. The propeller, driven by a motor, represented thelocomotive organs. The rudder, controlled by another motor likewise driven bythe battery, took the place of the directive organs. As to the sensitive organ,obviously the first thought was to utilize a device responsive to rays of light,like a selenium cell, to represent the human eye. But upon closer inquiry Ifound that, owing to experimental and other difficulties, no thoroughlysatisfactory control of the automaton could be effected by light, radiant heat,Hertzian radiations, or by rays in general, that is, disturbances which pass instraight lines through space. One of the reasons was that any obstacle comingbetween the operator and the distant automaton would place it beyond hiscontrol. Another reason was that the sensitive device representing the eye wouldhave to be in a definite position with respect to the distant controllingapparatus, and this necessity would impose great limitations in the control.Still another and very important reason was that, in using rays, it would bedifficult, if not impossible, to give to the automaton individual features orcharacteristics distinguishing it from other machines of this kind. Evidentlythe automaton should respond only to an individual call, as a person responds toa name. Such considerations led me to conclude that the sensitive device of themachine should correspond to the ear rather than to the eye of a human being,for in this case its actions could be controlled irrespective of interveningobstacles, regardless of its position relative to the distant controllingapparatus, and, last, but not least, it would remain deaf and unresponsive, likea faithful servant, to all calls but that of its master. These requirements madeit imperative to use, in the control of the automaton, instead of light- orother rays, waves or disturbances which propagate in all directions throughspace, like sound, or which follow a path of least resistance, however curved. Iattained the result aimed at by means of an electric circuit placed within theboat, and adjusted, or “tuned,” exactly to electrical vibrations of the properkind transmitted to it from a distant “electrical oscillator.” This circuit, inresponding, however feebly, to the transmitted vibrations, affected magnets andother contrivances, through the medium of which were controlled the movements ofthe propeller and rudder, and also the operations of numerous other appliances.By the simple means described the knowledge, experience, judgment—the mind, soto speak—of the distant operator were embodied in that machine, which was thusenabled to move and to perform all its operations with reason and intelligence.It behaved just like a blindfolded person obeying directions received throughthe ear.The automatons so far constructed had “borrowed minds,” so to speak, as eachmerely formed part of the distant operator who conveyed to it his intelligentorders; but this art is only in the beginning. I purpose to show that, howeverimpossible it may now seem, an automaton may be contrived which will have its“own mind,” and by this I mean that it will be able, independent of anyoperator, left entirely to itself, to perform, in response to externalinfluences affecting its sensitive organs, a great variety of acts andoperations as if it had intelligence. It will be able to follow a course laidout or to obey orders given far in advance; it will be capable of distinguishingbetween what it ought and what it ought not to do, and of making experiences or,otherwise stated, of recording impressions which will definitely affect itssubsequent actions. In fact, I have already conceived such a plan.Although I evolved this invention many years ago and explained it to my visitorsvery frequently in my laboratory demonstrations, it was not until much later,long after I had perfected it, that it became known, when, naturally enough, itgave rise to much discussion and to sensational reports. But the truesignificance of this new art was not grasped by the majority, nor was the greatforce of the underlying principle recognized. As nearly as I could judge fromthe numerous comments which then appeared, the results I had obtained wereconsidered as entirely impossible. Even the few who were disposed to admit thepracticability of the invention saw in it merely an automobile torpedo, whichwas to be used for the purpose of blowing up battle-ships, with doubtfulsuccess. The general impression was that I contemplated simply the steering ofsuch a vessel by means of Hertzian or other rays. There are torpedoes steeredelectrically by wires, and there are means of communicating without wires, andthe above was, of course, an obvious inference. Had I accomplished nothing morethan this, I should have made a small advance indeed. But the art I have evolveddoes not contemplate merely the change of direction of a moving vessel; itaffords a means of absolutely controlling, in every respect, all the innumerabletranslatory movements, as well as the operations of all the internal organs, nomatter how many, of an individualized automaton. Criticisms to the effect thatthe control of the automaton could be interfered with were made by people who donot even dream of the wonderful results which can be accomplished by the use ofelectrical vibrations. The world moves slowly, and new truths are difficult tosee. Certainly, by the use of this principle, an arm for attack as well asdefense may be provided, of a destructiveness all the greater as the principleis applicable to submarine and aërial vessels. There is virtually no restrictionas to the amount of explosive it can carry, or as to the distance at which itcan strike, and failure is almost impossible. But the force of this newprinciple does not wholly reside in its destructiveness. Its advent introducesinto warfare an element which never existed before—a fighting-machine withoutmen as a means of attack and defense. The continuous development in thisdirection must ultimately make war a mere contest of machines without men andwithout loss of life—a condition which would have been impossible without thisnew departure, and which, in my opinion, must be reached as preliminary topermanent peace. The future will either bear out or disprove these views. Myideas on this subject have been put forth with deep conviction, but in a humblespirit.The establishment of permanent peaceful relations between nations would mosteffectively reduce the force retarding the human mass, and would be the bestsolution of this great human problem. But will the dream of universal peace everbe realized? Let us hope that it will. When all darkness shall be dissipated bythe light of science, when all nations shall be merged into one, and patriotismshall be identical with religion, when there shall be one language, one country,one end, then the dream will have become reality.THE THIRD PROBLEM: HOW TO INCREASE THE FORCE ACCELERATING THE HUMAN MASS—THEHARNESSING OF THE SUN’S ENERGY.Of the three possible solutions of the main problem of increasing human energy,this is by far the most important to consider, not only because of its intrinsicsignificance, but also because of its intimate bearing on all the many elementsand conditions which determine the movement of humanity. In order to proceedsystematically, it would be necessary for me to dwell on all thoseconsiderations which have guided me from the outset in my efforts to arrive at asolution, and which have led me, step by step, to the results I shall nowdescribe. As a preliminary study of the problem an analytical investigation,such as I have made, of the chief forces which determine the onward movement,would be of advantage, particularly in conveying an idea of that hypothetical“velocity” which, as explained in the beginning, is a measure of human energy;but to deal with this specifically here, as I would desire, would lead me farbeyond the scope of the present subject. Suffice it to state that the resultantof all these forces is always in the direction of reason, which, therefore,determines, at any time, the direction of human movement. This is to say thatevery effort which is scientifically applied, rational, useful, or practical,must be in the direction in which the mass is moving. The practical, rationalman, the observer, the man of business, he who reasons, calculates, ordetermines in advance, carefully applies his effort so that when coming intoeffect it will be in the direction of the movement, making it thus mostefficient, and in this knowledge and ability lies the secret of his success.Every new fact discovered, every new experience or new element added to ourknowledge and entering into the domain of reason, affects the same and,therefore, changes the direction of the movement, which, however, must alwaystake place along the resultant of all those efforts which, at that time, wedesignate as reasonable, that is, self-preserving, useful, profitable, orpractical. These efforts concern our daily life, our necessities and comforts,our work and business, and it is these which drive man onward.But looking at all this busy world about us, on all this complex mass as itdaily throbs and moves, what is it but an immense clockwork driven by a spring?In the morning, when we rise, we cannot fail to note that all the objects aboutus are manufactured by machinery: the water we use is lifted by steam-power; thetrains bring our breakfast from distant localities; the elevators in ourdwelling and in our office building, the cars that carry us there, are alldriven by power; in all our daily errands, and in our very life-pursuit, wedepend upon it; all the objects we see tell us of it; and when we return to ourmachine-made dwelling at night, lest we should forget it, all the materialcomforts of our home, our cheering stove and lamp, remind us how much we dependon power. And when there is an accidental stoppage of the machinery, when thecity is snow-bound, or the life-sustaining movement otherwise temporarilyarrested, we are affrighted to realize how impossible it would be for us to livethe life we live without motive power. Motive power means work. To increase theforce accelerating human movement means, therefore, to perform more work.So we find that the three possible solutions of the great problem of increasinghuman energy are answered by the three words: food, peace, work. Many a year Ihave thought and pondered, lost myself in speculations and theories, consideringman as a mass moved by a force, viewing his inexplicable movement in the lightof a mechanical one, and applying the simple principles of mechanics to theanalysis of the same until I arrived at these solutions, only to realize thatthey were taught to me in my early childhood. These three words sound thekey-notes of the Christian religion. Their scientific meaning and purpose arenow clear to me: food to increase the mass, peace to diminish the retardingforce, and work to increase the force accelerating human movement. These are theonly three solutions which are possible of that great problem, and all of themhave one object, one end, namely, to increase human energy. When we recognizethis, we cannot help wondering how profoundly wise and scientific and howimmensely practical the Christian religion is, and in what a marked contrast itstands in this respect to other religions. It is unmistakably the result ofpractical experiment and scientific observation which have extended throughages, while other religions seem to be the outcome of merely abstract reasoning.Work, untiring effort, useful and accumulative, with periods of rest andrecuperation aiming at higher efficiency, is its chief and ever-recurringcommand. Thus we are inspired both by Christianity and Science to do our utmosttoward increasing the performance of mankind. This most important of humanproblems I shall now specifically consider.THE SOURCE OF HUMAN ENERGY—THE THREE WAYS OF DRAWING ENERGY FROM THE SUN.First let us ask: Whence comes all the motive power? What is the spring thatdrives all? We see the ocean rise and fall, the rivers flow, the wind, rain,hail, and snow beat on our windows, the trains and steamers come and go; we hearthe rattling noise of carriages, the voices from the street; we feel, smell, andtaste; and we think of all this. And all this movement, from the surging of themighty ocean to that subtle movement concerned in our thought, has but onecommon cause. All this energy emanates from one single center, one singlesource—the sun. The sun is the spring that drives all. The sun maintains allhuman life and supplies all human energy. Another answer we have now found tothe above great question: To increase the force accelerating human movementmeans to turn to the uses of man more of the sun’s energy. We honor and reverethose great men of bygone times whose names are linked with immortalachievements, who have proved themselves benefactors of humanity—the religiousreformer with his wise maxims of life, the philosopher with his deep truths, themathematician with his formulæ, the physicist with his laws, the discoverer withhis principles and secrets wrested from nature, the artist with his forms of thebeautiful; but who honors him, the greatest of all,—who can tell the name ofhim,—who first turned to use the sun’s energy to save the effort of a weakfellow-creature? That was man’s first act of scientific philanthropy, and itsconsequences have been incalculable.From the very beginning three ways of drawing energy from the sun were open toman. The savage, when he warmed his frozen limbs at a fire kindled in some way,availed himself of the energy of the sun stored in the burning material. When hecarried a bundle of branches to his cave and burned them there, he made use ofthe sun’s stored energy transported from one to another locality. When he setsail to his canoe, he utilized the energy of the sun supplied to the atmosphereor ambient medium. There can be no doubt that the first is the oldest way. Afire, found accidentally, taught the savage to appreciate its beneficial heat.He then very likely conceived the idea of carrying the glowing embers to hisabode. Finally he learned to use the force of a swift current of water or air.It is characteristic of modern development that progress has been effected inthe same order. The utilization of the energy stored in wood or coal; or,generally speaking, fuel, led to the steam-engine. Next a great stride inadvance was made in energy-transportation by the use of electricity, whichpermitted the transfer of energy from one locality to another withouttransporting the material. But as to the utilization of the energy of theambient medium, no radical step forward has as yet been made known.The ultimate results of development in these three directions are: first, theburning of coal by a cold process in a battery; second, the efficientutilization of the energy of the ambient medium; and, third, the transmissionwithout wires of electrical energy to any distance. In whatever way theseresults may be arrived at, their practical application will necessarily involvean extensive use of iron, and this invaluable metal will undoubtedly be anessential element in the further development along these three lines. If wesucceed in burning coal by a cold process and thus obtaining electrical energyin an efficient and inexpensive manner, we shall require in many practical usesof this energy electric motors—that is, iron. If we are successful in derivingenergy from the ambient medium, we shall need, both in the obtainment andutilization of the energy, machinery—again, iron. If we realize the transmissionof electrical energy without wires on an industrial scale, we shall be compelledto use extensively electric generators—once more, iron. Whatever we may do, ironwill probably be the chief means of accomplishment in the near future, possiblymore so than in the past. How long its reign will last is difficult to tell, foreven now aluminium is looming up as a threatening competitor. But for the timebeing, next to providing new resources of energy, it is of the greatestimportance to make improvements in the manufacture and utilization of iron.Great advances are possible in these latter directions, which, if brought about,would enormously increase the useful performance of mankind.GREAT POSSIBILITIES OFFERED BY IRON FOR INCREASING HUMAN PERFORMANCE—ENORMOUSWASTE IN IRON MANUFACTURE.Iron is by far the most important factor in modern progress. It contributes morethan any other industrial product to the force accelerating human movement. Sogeneral is the use of this metal, and so intimately is it connected with allthat concerns our life, that it has become as indispensable to us as the veryair we breathe. Its name is synonymous with usefulness. But, however great theinfluence of iron may be on the present human development, it does not add tothe force urging man onward nearly as much as it might. First of all, itsmanufacture as now carried on is connected with an appalling waste of fuel—thatis, waste of energy. Then, again, only a part of all the iron produced isapplied for useful purposes. A good part of it goes to create frictionalresistances, while still another large part is the means of developing negativeforces greatly retarding human movement. Thus the negative force of war isalmost wholly represented in iron. It is impossible to estimate with any degreeof accuracy the magnitude of this greatest of all retarding forces, but it iscertainly very considerable. If the present positive impelling force due to alluseful applications of iron be represented by ten, for instance, I should notthink it exaggeration to estimate the negative force of war, with dueconsideration of all its retarding influences and results, at, say, six. On thebasis of this estimate the effective impelling force of iron in the positivedirection would be measured by the difference of these two numbers, which isfour. But if, through the establishment of universal peace, the manufacture ofwar machinery should cease, and all struggle for supremacy between nationsshould be turned into healthful, ever active and productive commercialcompetition, then the positive impelling force due to iron would be measured bythe sum of those two numbers, which is sixteen—that is, this force would havefour times its present value. This example is, of course, merely intended togive an idea of the immense increase in the useful performance of mankind whichwould result from a radical reform of the iron industries supplying theimplements of warfare.A similar inestimable advantage in the saving of energy available to man wouldbe secured by obviating the great waste of coal which is inseparably connectedwith the present methods of manufacturing iron. In some countries, as in GreatBritain, the hurtful effects of this squandering of fuel are beginning to befelt. The price of coal is constantly rising, and the poor are made to suffermore and more. Though we are still far from the dreaded “exhaustion of thecoal-fields,” philanthropy commands us to invent novel methods of manufacturingiron, which will not involve such barbarous waste of this valuable material fromwhich we derive at present most of our energy. It is our duty to cominggenerations to leave this store of energy intact for them, or at least not totouch it until we shall have perfected processes for burning coal moreefficiently. Those who are to come after us will need fuel more than we do. Weshould be able to manufacture the iron we require by using the sun’s energy,without wasting any coal at all. As an effort to this end the idea of smeltingiron ores by electric currents obtained from the energy of falling water hasnaturally suggested itself to many. I have myself spent much time in endeavoringto evolve such a practical process, which would enable iron to be manufacturedat small cost. After a prolonged investigation of the subject, finding that itwas unprofitable to use the currents generated directly for smelting the ore, Idevised a method which is far more economical.ECONOMICAL PRODUCTION OF IRON BY A NEW PROCESS.The industrial project, as I worked it out six years ago, contemplated theemployment of the electric currents derived from the energy of a waterfall, notdirectly for smelting the ore, but for decomposing water, as a preliminary step.To lessen the cost of the plant, I proposed to generate the currents inexceptionally cheap and simple dynamos, which I designed for this sole purpose.The hydrogen liberated in the electrolytic decomposition was to be burned orrecombined with oxygen, not with that from which it was separated, but with thatof the atmosphere. Thus very nearly the total electrical energy used up in thedecomposition of the water would be recovered in the form of heat resulting fromthe recombination of the hydrogen. This heat was to be applied to the smeltingof the ore. The oxygen gained as a by-product in the decomposition of the waterI intended to use for certain other industrial purposes, which would probablyyield good financial returns, inasmuch as this is the cheapest way of obtainingthis gas in large quantities. In any event, it could be employed to burn allkinds of refuse, cheap hydrocarbon, or coal of the most inferior quality whichcould not be burned in air or be otherwise utilized to advantage, and thus againa considerable amount of heat would be made available for the smelting of theore. To increase the economy of the process I contemplated, furthermore, usingan arrangement such that the hot metal and the products of combustion, comingout of the furnace, would give up their heat upon the cold ore going into thefurnace, so that comparatively little of the heat-energy would be lost in thesmelting. I calculated that probably forty thousand pounds of iron could beproduced per horse-power per annum by this method. Liberal allowances were madefor those losses which are unavoidable, the above quantity being about half ofthat theoretically obtainable. Relying on this estimate and on practical datawith reference to a certain kind of sand ore existing in abundance in the regionof the Great Lakes, including cost of transportation and labor, I found that insome localities iron could be manufactured in this manner cheaper than by any ofthe adopted methods. This result would be attained all the more surely if theoxygen obtained from the water, instead of being used for smelting the ore, asassumed, should be more profitably employed. Any new demand for this gas wouldsecure a higher revenue from the plant, thus cheapening the iron. This projectwas advanced merely in the interest of industry. Some day, I hope, a beautifulindustrial butterfly will come out of the dusty and shriveled chrysalis.The production of iron from sand ores by a process of magnetic separation ishighly commendable in principle, since it involves no waste of coal; but theusefulness of this method is largely reduced by the necessity of melting theiron afterward. As to the crushing of iron ore, I would consider it rationalonly if done by water-power, or by energy otherwise obtained without consumptionof fuel. An electrolytic cold process, which would make it possible to extractiron cheaply, and also to mold it into the required forms without any fuelconsumption, would, in my opinion, be a very great advance in iron manufacture.In common with some other metals, iron has so far resisted electrolytictreatment, but there can be no doubt that such a cold process will ultimatelyreplace in metallurgy the present crude method of casting, and thus obviate theenormous waste of fuel necessitated by the repeated heating of metal in thefoundries.Up to a few decades ago the usefulness of iron was based almost wholly on itsremarkable mechanical properties, but since the advent of the commercial dynamoand electric motor its value to mankind has been greatly increased by its uniquemagnetic qualities. As regards the latter, iron has been greatly improved oflate. The signal progress began about thirteen years ago, when I discovered thatin using soft Bessemer steel instead of wrought iron, as then customary, in analternating motor, the performance of the machine was doubled. I brought thisfact to the attention of Mr. Albert Schmid, to whose untiring efforts andability is largely due the supremacy of American electrical machinery, and whowas then superintendent of an industrial corporation engaged in this field.Following my suggestion, he constructed transformers of steel, and they showedthe same marked improvement. The investigation was then systematically continuedunder Mr. Schmid’s guidance, the impurities being gradually eliminated from the“steel” (which was only such in name, for in reality it was pure soft iron), andsoon a product resulted which admitted of little further improvement.THE COMING AGE OF ALUMINIUM—DOOM OF THE COPPER INDUSTRY—THE GREAT CIVILIZINGPOTENCY OF THE NEW METAL.With the advances made in iron of late years we have arrived virtually at thelimits of improvement. We cannot hope to increase very materially its tensilestrength, elasticity, hardness, or malleability, nor can we expect to make itmuch better as regards its magnetic qualities. More recently a notable gain wassecured by the mixture of a small percentage of nickel with the iron, but thereis not much room for further advance in this direction. New discoveries may beexpected, but they cannot greatly add to the valuable properties of the metal,though they may considerably reduce the cost of manufacture. The immediatefuture of iron is assured by its cheapness and its unrivaled mechanical andmagnetic qualities. These are such that no other product can compete with itnow. But there can be no doubt that, at a time not very distant, iron, in manyof its now uncontested domains, will have to pass the scepter to another: thecoming age will be the age of aluminium. It is only seventy years since thiswonderful metal was discovered by Woehler, and the aluminium industry, scarcelyforty years old, commands already the attention of the entire world. Such rapidgrowth has not been recorded in the history of civilization before. Not long agoaluminium was sold at the fanciful price of thirty or forty dollars per pound;to-day it can be had in any desired amount for as many cents. What is more, thetime is not far off when this price, too, will be considered fanciful, for greatimprovements are possible in the methods of its manufacture. Most of the metalis now produced in the electric furnace by a process combining fusion andelectrolysis, which offers a number of advantageous features, but involvesnaturally a great waste of the electrical energy of the current. My estimatesshow that the price of aluminium could be considerably reduced by adopting inits manufacture a method similar to that proposed by me for the production ofiron. A pound of aluminium requires for fusion only about seventy per cent ofthe heat needed for melting a pound of iron, and inasmuch as its weight is onlyabout one third of that of the latter, a volume of aluminium four times that ofiron could be obtained from a given amount of heat-energy. But a coldelectrolytic process of manufacture is the ideal solution, and on this I haveplaced my hope.The absolutely unavoidable consequence of the advance of the aluminium industrywill be the annihilation of the copper industry. They cannot exist and prospertogether, and the latter is doomed beyond any hope of recovery. Even now it ischeaper to convey an electric current through aluminium wires than throughcopper wires: aluminium castings cost less, and in many domestic and other usescopper has no chance of successfully competing. A further material reduction ofthe price of aluminium cannot but be fatal to copper. But the progress of theformer will not go on unchecked, for, as it ever happens in such cases, thelarger industry will absorb the smaller one: the giant copper interests willcontrol the pygmy aluminium interests, and the slow-pacing copper will reducethe lively gait of aluminium. This will only delay, not avoid, the impendingcatastrophe.Aluminium, however, will not stop at downing copper. Before many years havepassed it will be engaged in a fierce struggle with iron, and in the latter itwill find an adversary not easy to conquer. The issue of the contest willlargely depend on whether iron shall be indispensable in electric machinery.This the future alone can decide. The magnetism as exhibited in iron is anisolated phenomenon in nature. What it is that makes this metal behave soradically different from all other materials in this respect has not yet beenascertained, though many theories have been suggested. As regards magnetism, themolecules of the various bodies behave like hollow beams partly filled with aheavy fluid and balanced in the middle in the manner of a see-saw. Evidentlysome disturbing influence exists in nature which causes each molecule, like sucha beam, to tilt either one or the other way. If the molecules are tilted oneway, the body is magnetic; if they are tilted the other way, the body isnon-magnetic; but both positions are stable, as they would be in the case of thehollow beam, owing to the rushing of the fluid to the lower end. Now, thewonderful thing is that the molecules of all known bodies went one way, whilethose of iron went the other way. This metal, it would seem, has an originentirely different from that of the rest of the globe. It is highly improbablethat we shall discover some other and cheaper material which will equal orsurpass iron in magnetic qualities.Unless we should make a radical departure in the character of the electriccurrents employed, iron will be indispensable. Yet the advantages it offers areonly apparent. So long as we use feeble magnetic forces it is by far superior toany other material; but if we find ways of producing great magnetic forces, thenbetter results will be obtainable without it. In fact, I have already producedelectric transformers in which no iron is employed, and which are capable ofperforming ten times as much work per pound of weight as those with iron. Thisresult is attained by using electric currents of a very high rate of vibration,produced in novel ways, instead of the ordinary currents now employed in theindustries. I have also succeeded in operating electric motors without iron bysuch rapidly vibrating currents, but the results, so far, have been inferior tothose obtained with ordinary motors constructed of iron, although theoreticallythe former should be capable of performing incomparably more work per unit ofweight than the latter. But the seemingly insuperable difficulties which are nowin the way may be overcome in the end, and then iron will be done away with, andall electric machinery will be manufactured of aluminium, in all probability, atprices ridiculously low. This would be a severe, if not a fatal, blow to iron.In many other branches of industry, as ship-building, or wherever lightness ofstructure is required, the progress of the new metal will be much quicker. Forsuch uses it is eminently suitable, and is sure to supersede iron sooner orlater. It is highly probable that in the course of time we shall be able to giveit many of those qualities which make iron so valuable.While it is impossible to tell when this industrial revolution will beconsummated, there can be no doubt that the future belongs to aluminium, andthat in times to come it will be the chief means of increasing humanperformance. It has in this respect capacities greater by far than those of anyother metal. I should estimate its civilizing potency at fully one hundred timesthat of iron. This estimate, though it may astonish, is not at all exaggerated.First of all, we must remember that there is thirty times as much aluminium asiron in bulk, available for the uses of man. This in itself offers greatpossibilities. Then, again, the new metal is much more easily workable, whichadds to its value. In many of its properties it partakes of the character of aprecious metal, which gives it additional worth. Its electric conductivity,which, for a given weight, is greater than that of any other metal, would bealone sufficient to make it one of the most important factors in future humanprogress. Its extreme lightness makes it far more easy to transport the objectsmanufactured. By virtue of this property it will revolutionize navalconstruction, and in facilitating transport and travel it will add enormously tothe useful performance of mankind. But its greatest civilizing potency will be,I believe, in aërial travel, which is sure to be brought about by means of it.Telegraphic instruments will slowly enlighten the barbarian. Electric motors andlamps will do it more quickly, but quicker than anything else the flying-machinewill do it. By rendering travel ideally easy it will be the best means forunifying the heterogeneous elements of humanity. As the first step toward thisrealization we should produce a lighter storage-battery or get more energy fromcoal.EFFORTS TOWARD OBTAINING MORE ENERGY FROM COAL—THE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION—THEGAS-ENGINE—THE COLD-COAL BATTERY.I remember that at one time I considered the production of electricity byburning coal in a battery as the greatest achievement toward advancingcivilization, and I am surprised to find how much the continuous study of thesesubjects has modified my views. It now seems to me that to burn coal, howeverefficiently, in a battery would be a mere makeshift, a phase in the evolutiontoward something much more perfect. After all, in generating electricity in thismanner, we should be destroying material, and this would be a barbarous process.We ought to be able to obtain the energy we need without consumption ofmaterial. But I am far from underrating the value of such an efficient method ofburning fuel. At the present time most motive power comes from coal, and, eitherdirectly or by its products, it adds vastly to human energy. Unfortunately, inall the processes now adopted, the larger portion of the energy of the coal isuselessly dissipated. The best steam-engines utilize only a small part of thetotal energy. Even in gas-engines, in which, particularly of late, betterresults are obtainable, there is still a barbarous waste going on. In ourelectric-lighting systems we scarcely utilize one third of one per cent., and inlighting by gas a much smaller fraction, of the total energy of the coal.Considering the various uses of coal throughout the world, we certainly do notutilize more than two per cent. of its energy theoretically available. The manwho should stop this senseless waste would be a great benefactor of humanity,though the solution he would offer could not be a permanent one, since it wouldultimately lead to the exhaustion of the store of material. Efforts towardobtaining more energy from coal are now being made chiefly in two directions—bygenerating electricity and by producing gas for motive-power purposes. In bothof these lines notable success has already been achieved.The advent of the alternating-current system of electric power-transmissionmarks an epoch in the economy of energy available to man from coal. Evidentlyall electrical energy obtained from a waterfall, saving so much fuel, is a netgain to mankind, which is all the more effective as it is secured with littleexpenditure of human effort, and as this most perfect of all known methods ofderiving energy from the sun contributes in many ways to the advancement ofcivilization. But electricity enables us also to get from coal much more energythan was practicable in the old ways. Instead of transporting the coal todistant places of consumption, we burn it near the mine, develop electricity inthe dynamos, and transmit the current to remote localities, thus effecting aconsiderable saving. Instead of driving the machinery in a factory in the oldwasteful way by belts and shafting, we generate electricity by steam-power andoperate electric motors. In this manner it is not uncommon to obtain two orthree times as much effective motive power from the fuel, besides securing manyother important advantages. It is in this field as much as in the transmissionof energy to great distances that the alternating system, with its ideallysimple machinery, is bringing about an industrial revolution. But in many linesthis progress has not yet been felt. For example, steamers and trains are stillbeing propelled by the direct application of steam-power to shafts or axles. Amuch greater percentage of the heat-energy of the fuel could be transformed inmotive energy by using, in place of the adopted marine engines and locomotives,dynamos driven by specially designed high-pressure steam- or gas-engines and byutilizing the electricity generated for the propulsion. A gain of fifty to onehundred per cent. in the effective energy derived from the coal could be securedin this manner. It is difficult to understand why a fact so plain and obvious isnot receiving more attention from engineers. In ocean steamers such animprovement would be particularly desirable, as it would do away with noise andincrease materially the speed and the carrying capacity of the liners.Still more energy is now being obtained from coal by the latest improvedgas-engine, the economy of which is, on the average, probably twice that of thebest steam-engine. The introduction of the gas-engine is very much facilitatedby the importance of the gas industry. With the increasing use of the electriclight more and more of the gas is utilized for heating and motive-powerpurposes. In many instances gas is manufactured close to the coal-mine andconveyed to distant places of consumption, a considerable saving both in thecost of transportation and in utilization of the energy of the fuel being thuseffected. In the present state of the mechanical and electrical arts the mostrational way of deriving energy from coal is evidently to manufacture gas closeto the coal store, and to utilize it, either on the spot or elsewhere, togenerate electricity for industrial uses in dynamos driven by gas-engines. Thecommercial success of such a plant is largely dependent upon the production ofgas-engines of great nominal horse-power, which, judging from the keen activityin this field, will soon be forthcoming. Instead of consuming coal directly, asusual, gas should be manufactured from it and burned to economize energy.But all such improvements cannot be more than passing phases in the evolutiontoward something far more perfect, for ultimately we must succeed in obtainingelectricity from coal in a more direct way, involving no great loss of itsheat-energy. Whether coal can be oxidized by a cold process is still a question.Its combination with oxygen always evolves heat, and whether the energy of thecombination of the carbon with another element can be turned directly intoelectrical energy has not yet been determined. Under certain conditions nitricacid will burn the carbon, generating an electric current, but the solution doesnot remain cold. Other means of oxidizing coal have been proposed, but they haveoffered no promise of leading to an efficient process. My own lack of successhas been complete, though perhaps not quite so complete as that of some who have“perfected” the cold-coal battery. This problem is essentially one for thechemist to solve. It is not for the physicist, who determines all his results inadvance, so that, when the experiment is tried, it cannot fail. Chemistry,though a positive science, does not yet admit of a solution by such positivemethods as those which are available in the treatment of many physical problems.The result, if possible, will be arrived at through patient trying rather thanthrough deduction or calculation. The time will soon come, however, when thechemist will be able to follow a course clearly mapped out beforehand, and whenthe process of his arriving at a desired result will be purely constructive. Thecold-coal battery would give a great impetus to electrical development; it wouldlead very shortly to a practical flying-machine, and would enormously enhancethe introduction of the automobile. But these and many other problems will bebetter solved, and in a more scientific manner, by a light-storage battery.ENERGY FROM THE MEDIUM—THE WINDMILL AND THE SOLAR ENGINE—MOTIVE POWER FROMTERRESTRIAL HEAT—ELECTRICITY FROM NATURAL SOURCES.Besides fuel, there is abundant material from which we might eventually derivepower. An immense amount of energy is locked up in limestone, for instance, andmachines can be driven by liberating the carbonic acid through sulphuric acid orotherwise. I once constructed such an engine, and it operated satisfactorily.But, whatever our resources of primary energy may be in the future, we must, tobe rational, obtain it without consumption of any material. Long ago I came tothis conclusion, and to arrive at this result only two ways, as beforeindicated, appeared possible—either to turn to use the energy of the sun storedin the ambient medium, or to transmit, through the medium, the sun’s energy todistant places from some locality where it was obtainable without consumption ofmaterial. At that time I at once rejected the latter method as entirelyimpracticable, and turned to examine the possibilities of the former.It is difficult to believe, but it is, nevertheless, a fact, that since timeimmemorial man has had at his disposal a fairly good machine which has enabledhim to utilize the energy of the ambient medium. This machine is the windmill.Contrary to popular belief, the power obtainable from wind is very considerable.Many a deluded inventor has spent years of his life in endeavoring to “harnessthe tides,” and some have even proposed to compress air by tide- or wave-powerfor supplying energy, never understanding the signs of the old windmill on thehill, as it sorrowfully waved its arms about and bade them stop. The fact isthat a wave- or tide-motor would have, as a rule, but a small chance ofcompeting commercially with the windmill, which is by far the better machine,allowing a much greater amount of energy to be obtained in a simpler way.Wind-power has been, in old times, of inestimable value to man, if for nothingelse but for enabling him to cross the seas, and it is even now a very importantfactor in travel and transportation. But there are great limitations in thisideally simple method of utilizing the sun’s energy. The machines are large fora given output, and the power is intermittent, thus necessitating the storage ofenergy and increasing the cost of the plant.A far better way, however, to obtain power would be to avail ourselves of thesun’s rays, which beat the earth incessantly and supply energy at a maximum rateof over four million horse-power per square mile. Although the average energyreceived per square mile in any locality during the year is only a smallfraction of that amount, yet an inexhaustible source of power would be opened upby the discovery of some efficient method of utilizing the energy of the rays.The only rational way known to me at the time when I began the study of thissubject was to employ some kind of heat- or thermodynamic engine, driven by avolatile fluid evaporated in a boiler by the heat of the rays. But closerinvestigation of this method, and calculation, showed that, notwithstanding theapparently vast amount of energy received from the sun’s rays, only a smallfraction of that energy could be actually utilized in this manner. Furthermore,the energy supplied through the sun’s radiations is periodical, and the samelimitations as in the use of the windmill I found to exist here also. After along study of this mode of obtaining motive power from the sun, taking intoaccount the necessarily large bulk of the boiler, the low efficiency of theheat-engine, the additional cost of storing the energy, and other drawbacks, Icame to the conclusion that the “solar engine,” a few instances excepted, couldnot be industrially exploited with success.Another way of getting motive power from the medium without consuming anymaterial would be to utilize the heat contained in the earth, the water, or theair for driving an engine. It is a well-known fact that the interior portions ofthe globe are very hot, the temperature rising, as observations show, with theapproach to the center at the rate of approximately 1° C. for every hundred feetof depth. The difficulties of sinking shafts and placing boilers at depths of,say, twelve thousand feet, corresponding to an increase in temperature of about120°C., are not insuperable, and we could certainly avail ourselves in this wayof the internal heat of the globe. In fact, it would not be necessary to go toany depth at all in order to derive energy from the stored terrestrial heat. Thesuperficial layers of the earth and the air strata close to the same are at atemperature sufficiently high to evaporate some extremely volatile substances,which we might use in our boilers instead of water. There is no doubt that avessel might be propelled on the ocean by an engine driven by such a volatilefluid, no other energy being used but the heat abstracted from the water. Butthe amount of power which could be obtained in this manner would be, withoutfurther provision, very small.Electricity produced by natural causes is another source of energy which mightbe rendered available. Lightning discharges involve great amounts of electricalenergy, which we could utilize by transforming and storing it. Some years ago Imade known a method of electrical transformation which renders the first part ofthis task easy, but the storing of the energy of lightning discharges will bedifficult to accomplish. It is well known, furthermore, that electric currentscirculate constantly through the earth, and that there exists between the earthand any air stratum a difference of electrical pressure, which varies inproportion to the height.In recent experiments I have discovered two novel facts of importance in thisconnection. One of these facts is that an electric current is generated in awire extending from the ground to a great height by the axial, and probably alsoby the translatory, movement of the earth. No appreciable current, however, willflow continuously in the wire unless the electricity is allowed to leak out intothe air. Its escape is greatly facilitated by providing at the elevated end ofthe wire a conducting terminal of great surface, with many sharp edges orpoints. We are thus enabled to get a continuous supply of electrical energy bymerely supporting a wire at a height, but, unfortunately, the amount ofelectricity which can be so obtained is small.The second fact which I have ascertained is that the upper air strata arepermanently charged with electricity opposite to that of the earth. So, atleast, I have interpreted my observations, from which it appears that the earth,with its adjacent insulating and outer conducting envelop, constitutes a highlycharged electrical condenser containing, in all probability, a great amount ofelectrical energy which might be turned to the uses of man, if it were possibleto reach with a wire to great altitudes.It is possible, and even probable, that there will be, in time, other resourcesof energy opened up, of which we have no knowledge now. We may even find ways ofapplying forces such as magnetism or gravity for driving machinery without usingany other means. Such realizations, though highly improbable, are notimpossible. An example will best convey an idea of what we can hope to attainand what we can never attain. Imagine a disk of some homogeneous material turnedperfectly true and arranged to turn in frictionless bearings on a horizontalshaft above the ground. This disk, being under the above conditions perfectlybalanced, would rest in any position. Now, it is possible that we may learn howto make such a disk rotate continuously and perform work by the force of gravitywithout any further effort on our part; but it is perfectly impossible for thedisk to turn and to do work without any force from the outside. If it could doso, it would be what is designated scientifically as a “perpetuum mobile,” amachine creating its own motive power. To make the disk rotate by the force ofgravity we have only to invent a screen against this force. By such a screen wecould prevent this force from acting on one half of the disk, and the rotationof the latter would follow. At least, we cannot deny such a possibility until weknow exactly the nature of the force of gravity. Suppose that this force weredue to a movement comparable to that of a stream of air passing from abovetoward the center of the earth. The effect of such a stream upon both halves ofthe disk would be equal, and the latter would not rotate ordinarily; but if onehalf should be guarded by a plate arresting the movement, then it would turn.A DEPARTURE FROM KNOWN METHODS—POSSIBILITY OF A “SELF-ACTING” ENGINE OR MACHINE,INANIMATE, YET CAPABLE, LIKE A LIVING BEING, OF DERIVING ENERGY FROM THEMEDIUM—THE IDEAL WAY OF OBTAINING MOTIVE POWER.When I began the investigation of the subject under consideration, and when thepreceding or similar ideas presented themselves to me for the first time, thoughI was then unacquainted with a number of the facts mentioned, a survey of thevarious ways of utilizing the energy of the medium convinced me, nevertheless,that to arrive at a thoroughly satisfactory practical solution a radicaldeparture from the methods then known had to be made. The windmill, the solarengine, the engine driven by terrestrial heat, had their limitations in theamount of power obtainable. Some new way had to be discovered which would enableus to get more energy. There was enough heat-energy in the medium, but only asmall part of it was available for the operation of an engine in the ways thenknown. Besides, the energy was obtainable only at a very slow rate. Clearly,then, the problem was to discover some new method which would make it possibleboth to utilize more of the heat-energy of the medium and also to draw it awayfrom the same at a more rapid rate.I was vainly endeavoring to form an idea of how this might be accomplished, whenI read some statements from Carnot and Lord Kelvin (then Sir William Thomson)which meant virtually that it is impossible for an inanimate mechanism orself-acting machine to cool a portion of the medium below the temperature of thesurrounding, and operate by the heat abstracted. These statements interested meintensely. Evidently a living being could do this very thing, and since theexperiences of my early life which I have related had convinced me that a livingbeing is only an automaton, or, otherwise stated, a “self-acting engine,” I cameto the conclusion that it was possible to construct a machine which would do thesame. As the first step toward this realization I conceived the followingmechanism. Imagine a thermopile consisting of a number of bars of metalextending from the earth to the outer space beyond the atmosphere. The heat frombelow, conducted upward along these metal bars, would cool the earth or the seaor the air, according to the location of the lower parts of the bars, and theresult, as is well known, would be an electric current circulating in thesebars. The two terminals of the thermopile could now be joined through anelectric motor, and, theoretically, this motor would run on and on, until themedia below would be cooled down to the temperature of the outer space. Thiswould be an inanimate engine which, to all evidence, would be cooling a portionof the medium below the temperature of the surrounding, and operating by theheat abstracted.But was it not possible to realize a similar condition without necessarily goingto a height? Conceive, for the sake of illustration, an inclosure T, asillustrated in diagram b, such that energy could not be transferred across itexcept through a channel or path O, and that, by some means or other, in thisinclosure a medium were maintained which would have little energy, and that onthe outer side of the same there would be the ordinary ambient medium with muchenergy. Under these assumptions the energy would flow through the path O, asindicated by the arrow, and might then be converted on its passage into someother form of energy. The question was, Could such a condition be attained?Could we produce artificially such a “sink” for the energy of the ambient mediumto flow in? Suppose that an extremely low temperature could be maintained bysome process in a given space; the surrounding medium would then be compelled togive off heat, which could be converted into mechanical or other form of energy,and utilized. By realizing such a plan, we should be enabled to get at any pointof the globe a continuous supply of energy, day and night. More than this,reasoning in the abstract, it would seem possible to cause a quick circulationof the medium, and thus draw the energy at a very rapid rate.Here, then, was an idea which, if realizable, afforded a happy solution of theproblem of getting energy from the medium. But was it realizable? I convincedmyself that it was so in a number of ways, of which one is the following. Asregards heat, we are at a high level, which may be represented by the surface ofa mountain lake considerably above the sea, the level of which may mark theabsolute zero of temperature existing in the interstellar space. Heat, likewater, flows from high to low level, and, consequently, just as we can let thewater of the lake run down to the sea, so we are able to let heat from theearth’s surface travel up into the cold region above. Heat, like water, canperform work in flowing down, and if we had any doubt as to whether we couldderive energy from the medium by means of a thermopile, as before described, itwould be dispelled by this analogue. But can we produce cold in a given portionof the space and cause the heat to flow in continually? To create such a “sink,”or “cold hole,” as we might say, in the medium, would be equivalent to producingin the lake a space either empty or filled with something much lighter thanwater. This we could do by placing in the lake a tank, and pumping all the waterout of the latter. We know, then, that the water, if allowed to flow back intothe tank, would, theoretically, be able to perform exactly the same amount ofwork which was used in pumping it out, but not a bit more. Consequently nothingcould be gained in this double operation of first raising the water and thenletting it fall down. This would mean that it is impossible to create such asink in the medium. But let us reflect a moment. Heat, though following certaingeneral laws of mechanics, like a fluid, is not such; it is energy which may beconverted into other forms of energy as it passes from a high to a low level. Tomake our mechanical analogy complete and true, we must, therefore, assume thatthe water, in its passage into the tank, is converted into something else, whichmay be taken out of it without using any, or by using very little, power. Forexample, if heat be represented in this analogue by the water of the lake, theoxygen and hydrogen composing the water may illustrate other forms of energyinto which the heat is transformed in passing from hot to cold. If the processof heat-transformation were absolutely perfect, no heat at all would arrive atthe low level, since all of it would be converted into other forms of energy.Corresponding to this ideal case, all the water flowing into the tank would bedecomposed into oxygen and hydrogen before reaching the bottom, and the resultwould be that water would continually flow in, and yet the tank would remainentirely empty, the gases formed escaping. We would thus produce, by expendinginitially a certain amount of work to create a sink for the heat or,respectively, the water to flow in, a condition enabling us to get any amount ofenergy without further effort. This would be an ideal way of obtaining motivepower. We do not know of any such absolutely perfect process of heat-conversion,and consequently some heat will generally reach the low level, which means tosay, in our mechanical analogue, that some water will arrive at the bottom ofthe tank, and a gradual and slow filling of the latter will take place,necessitating continuous pumping out. But evidently there will be less to pumpout than flows in, or, in other words, less energy will be needed to maintainthe initial condition than is developed by the fall, and this is to say thatsome energy will be gained from the medium. What is not converted in flowingdown can just be raised up with its own energy, and what is converted is cleargain. Thus the virtue of the principle I have discovered resides wholly in theconversion of the energy on the downward flow.FIRST EFFORTS TO PRODUCE THE SELF-ACTING ENGINE—THE MECHANICAL OSCILLATOR—WORKOF DEWAR AND LINDE—LIQUID AIR.Having recognized this truth, I began to devise means for carrying out my idea,and, after long thought, I finally conceived a combination of apparatus whichshould make possible the obtaining of power from the medium by a process ofcontinuous cooling of atmospheric air. This apparatus, by continuallytransforming heat into mechanical work, tended to become colder and colder, andif it only were practicable to reach a very low temperature in this manner, thena sink for the heat could be produced, and energy could be derived from themedium. This seemed to be contrary to the statements of Carnot and Lord Kelvinbefore referred to, but I concluded from the theory of the process that such aresult could be attained. This conclusion I reached, I think, in the latter partof 1883, when I was in Paris, and it was at a time when my mind was being moreand more dominated by an invention which I had evolved during the precedingyear, and which has since become known under the name of the “rotating magneticfield.” During the few years which followed I elaborated further the plan I hadimagined, and studied the working conditions, but made little headway. Thecommercial introduction in this country of the invention before referred torequired most of my energies until 1889, when I again took up the idea of theself-acting machine. A closer investigation of the principles involved, andcalculation, now showed that the result I aimed at could not be reached in apractical manner by ordinary machinery, as I had in the beginning expected. Thisled me, as a next step, to the study of a type of engine generally designated as“turbine,” which at first seemed to offer better chances for a realization ofthe idea. Soon I found, however, that the turbine, too, was unsuitable. But myconclusions showed that if an engine of a peculiar kind could be brought to ahigh degree of perfection, the plan I had conceived was realizable, and Iresolved to proceed with the development of such an engine, the primary objectof which was to secure the greatest economy of transformation of heat intomechanical energy. A characteristic feature of the engine was that thework-performing piston was not connected with anything else, but was perfectlyfree to vibrate at an enormous rate. The mechanical difficulties encountered inthe construction of this engine were greater than I had anticipated, and I madeslow progress. This work was continued until early in 1892, when I went toLondon, where I saw Professor Dewar’s admirable experiments with liquefiedgases. Others had liquefied gases before, and notably Ozlewski and Pictet hadperformed creditable early experiments in this line, but there was such a vigorabout the work of Dewar that even the old appeared new. His experiments showed,though in a way different from that I had imagined, that it was possible toreach a very low temperature by transforming heat into mechanical work, and Ireturned, deeply impressed with what I had seen, and more than ever convincedthat my plan was practicable. The work temporarily interrupted was taken upanew, and soon I had in a fair state of perfection the engine which I have named“the mechanical oscillator.” In this machine I succeeded in doing away with allpackings, valves, and lubrication, and in producing so rapid a vibration of thepiston that shafts of tough steel, fastened to the same and vibratedlongitudinally, were torn asunder. By combining this engine with a dynamo ofspecial design I produced a highly efficient electrical generator, invaluable inmeasurements and determinations of physical quantities on account of theunvarying rate of oscillation obtainable by its means. I exhibited several typesof this machine, named “mechanical and electrical oscillator,” before theElectrical Congress at the World’s Fair in Chicago during the summer of 1893, ina lecture which, on account of other pressing work, I was unable to prepare forpublication. On that occasion I exposed the principles of the mechanicaloscillator, but the original purpose of this machine is explained here for thefirst time.In the process, as I had primarily conceived it, for the utilization of theenergy of the ambient medium, there were five essential elements in combination,and each of these had to be newly designed and perfected, as no such machinesexisted. The mechanical oscillator was the first element of this combination,and having perfected this, I turned to the next, which was an air-compressor ofa design in certain respects resembling that of the mechanical oscillator.Similar difficulties in the construction were again encountered, but the workwas pushed vigorously, and at the close of 1894 I had completed these twoelements of the combination, and thus produced an apparatus for compressing air,virtually to any desired pressure, incomparably simpler, smaller, and moreefficient than the ordinary. I was just beginning work on the third element,which together with the first two would give a refrigerating machine ofexceptional efficiency and simplicity, when a misfortune befell me in theburning of my laboratory, which crippled my labors and delayed me. Shortlyafterward Dr. Carl Linde announced the liquefaction of air by a self-coolingprocess, demonstrating that it was practicable to proceed with the cooling untilliquefaction of the air took place. This was the only experimental proof which Iwas still wanting that energy was obtainable from the medium in the mannercontemplated by me.The liquefaction of air by a self-cooling process was not, as popularlybelieved, an accidental discovery, but a scientific result which could not havebeen delayed much longer, and which, in all probability, could not have escapedDewar. This fascinating advance, I believe, is largely due to the powerful workof this great Scotchman. Nevertheless, Linde’s is an immortal achievement. Themanufacture of liquid air has been carried on for four years in Germany, on ascale much larger than in any other country, and this strange product has beenapplied for a variety of purposes. Much was expected of it in the beginning, butso far it has been an industrial ignis fatuus. By the use of such machinery as Iam perfecting, its cost will probably be greatly lessened, but even then itscommercial success will be questionable. When used as a refrigerant it isuneconomical, as its temperature is unnecessarily low. It is as expensive tomaintain a body at a very low temperature as it is to keep it very hot; it takescoal to keep air cold. In oxygen manufacture it cannot yet compete with theelectrolytic method. For use as an explosive it is unsuitable, because its lowtemperature again condemns it to a small efficiency, and for motive-powerpurposes its cost is still by far too high. It is of interest to note, however,that in driving an engine by liquid air a certain amount of energy may be gainedfrom the engine, or, stated otherwise, from the ambient medium which keeps theengine warm, each two hundred pounds of iron-casting of the latter contributingenergy at the rate of about one effective horse-power during one hour. But thisgain of the consumer is offset by an equal loss of the producer.Much of this task on which I have labored so long remains to be done. A numberof mechanical details are still to be perfected and some difficulties of adifferent nature to be mastered, and I cannot hope to produce a self-actingmachine deriving energy from the ambient medium for a long time yet, even if allmy expectations should materialize. Many circumstances have occurred which haveretarded my work of late, but for several reasons the delay was beneficial.One of these reasons was that I had ample time to consider what the ultimatepossibilities of this development might be. I worked for a long time fullyconvinced that the practical realization of this method of obtaining energy fromthe sun would be of incalculable industrial value, but the continued study ofthe subject revealed the fact that while it will be commercially profitable ifmy expectations are well founded, it will not be so to an extraordinary degree.DISCOVERY OF UNEXPECTED PROPERTIES OF THE ATMOSPHERE—STRANGEEXPERIMENTS—TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY THROUGH ONE WIRE WITHOUTRETURN—TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE EARTH WITHOUT ANY WIRE.Another of these reasons was that I was led to recognize the transmission ofelectrical energy to any distance through the media as by far the best solutionof the great problem of harnessing the sun’s energy for the uses of man. For along time I was convinced that such a transmission on an industrial scale couldnever be realized, but a discovery which I made changed my view. I observed thatunder certain conditions the atmosphere, which is normally a high insulator,assumes conducting properties, and so becomes capable of conveying any amount ofelectrical energy. But the difficulties in the way of a practical utilization ofthis discovery for the purpose of transmitting electrical energy without wireswere seemingly insuperable. Electrical pressures of many millions of volts hadto be produced and handled; generating apparatus of a novel kind, capable ofwithstanding the immense electrical stresses, had to be invented and perfected,and a complete safety against the dangers of the high-tension currents had to beattained in the system before its practical introduction could be even thoughtof. All this could not be done in a few weeks or months, or even years. The workrequired patience and constant application, but the improvements came, thoughslowly. Other valuable results were, however, arrived at in the course of thislong-continued work, of which I shall endeavor to give a brief account,enumerating the chief advances as they were successively effected.The discovery of the conducting properties of the air, though unexpected, wasonly a natural result of experiments in a special field which I had carried onfor some years before. It was, I believe, during 1889 that certain possibilitiesoffered by extremely rapid electrical oscillations determined me to design anumber of special machines adapted for their investigation. Owing to thepeculiar requirements, the construction of these machines was very difficult,and consumed much time and effort; but my work on them was generously rewarded,for I reached by their means several novel and important results. One of theearliest observations I made with these new machines was that electricaloscillations of an extremely high rate act in an extraordinary manner upon thehuman organism. Thus, for instance, I demonstrated that powerful electricaldischarges of several hundred thousand volts, which at that time were consideredabsolutely deadly, could be passed through the body without inconvenience orhurtful consequences. These oscillations produced other specific physiologicaleffects, which, upon my announcement, were eagerly taken up by skilledphysicians and further investigated. This new field has proved itself fruitfulbeyond expectation, and in the few years which have passed since, it has beendeveloped to such an extent that it now forms a legitimate and importantdepartment of medical science. Many results, thought impossible at that time,are now readily obtainable with these oscillations, and many experimentsundreamed of then can now be readily performed by their means. I still rememberwith pleasure how, nine years ago, I passed the discharge of a powerfulinduction-coil through my body to demonstrate before a scientific society thecomparative harmlessness of very rapidly vibrating electric currents, and I canstill recall the astonishment of my audience. I would now undertake, with muchless apprehension than I had in that experiment, to transmit through my bodywith such currents the entire electrical energy of the dynamos now working atNiagara—forty or fifty thousand horse-power. I have produced electricaloscillations which were of such intensity that when circulating through my armsand chest they have melted wires which joined my hands, and still I felt noinconvenience. I have energized with such oscillations a loop of heavy copperwire so powerfully that masses of metal, and even objects of an electricalresistance specifically greater than that of human tissue, brought close to orplaced within the loop, were heated to a high temperature and melted, often withthe violence of an explosion, and yet into this very space in which thisterribly destructive turmoil was going on I have repeatedly thrust my headwithout feeling anything or experiencing injurious after-effects.Another observation was that by means of such oscillations light could beproduced in a novel and more economical manner, which promised to lead to anideal system of electric illumination by vacuum-tubes, dispensing with thenecessity of renewal of lamps or incandescent filaments, and possibly also withthe use of wires in the interior of buildings. The efficiency of this lightincreases in proportion to the rate of the oscillations, and its commercialsuccess is, therefore, dependent on the economical production of electricalvibrations of transcending rates. In this direction I have met with gratifyingsuccess of late, and the practical introduction of this new system ofillumination is not far off.The investigations led to many other valuable observations and results, one ofthe more important of which was the demonstration of the practicability ofsupplying electrical energy through one wire without return. At first I was ableto transmit in this novel manner only very small amounts of electrical energy,but in this line also my efforts have been rewarded with similar success.The photograph shown in Fig.3 illustrates, as its title explains, an actualtransmission of this kind effected with apparatus used in other experiments heredescribed. To what a degree the appliances have been perfected since my firstdemonstrations early in 1891 before a scientific society, when my apparatus wasbarely capable of lighting one lamp (which result was considered wonderful),will appear when I state that I have now no difficulty in lighting in thismanner four or five hundred lamps, and could light many more. In fact, there isno limit to the amount of energy which may in this way be supplied to operateany kind of electrical device.After demonstrating the practicability of this method of transmission, thethought naturally occurred to me to use the earth as a conductor, thusdispensing with all wires. Whatever electricity may be, it is a fact that itbehaves like an incompressible fluid, and the earth may be looked upon as animmense reservoir of electricity, which, I thought, could be disturbedeffectively by a properly designed electrical machine. Accordingly, my nextefforts were directed toward perfecting a special apparatus which would behighly effective in creating a disturbance of electricity in the earth. Theprogress in this new direction was necessarily very slow and the workdiscouraging, until I finally succeeded in perfecting a novel kind oftransformer or induction-coil, particularly suited for this special purpose.That it is practicable, in this manner, not only to transmit minute amounts ofelectrical energy for operating delicate electrical devices, as I contemplatedat first, but also electrical energy in appreciable quantities, will appear froman inspection of Fig. 4, which illustrates an actual experiment of this kindperformed with the same apparatus. The result obtained was all the moreremarkable as the top end of the coil was not connected to a wire or plate formagnifying the effect.“WIRELESS” TELEGRAPHY—THE SECRET OF TUNING—ERRORS IN THE HERTZIANINVESTIGATIONS—A RECEIVER OF WONDERFUL SENSITIVENESS.As the first valuable result of my experiments in this latter line a system oftelegraphy without wires resulted, which I described in two scientific lecturesin February and March, 1893. It is mechanically illustrated in diagram c, theupper part of which shows the electrical arrangement as I described it then,while the lower part illustrates its mechanical analogue. The system isextremely simple in principle. Imagine two tuning-forks F, F1, one at thesending- and the other at the receiving-station respectively, each havingattached to its lower prong a minute piston p, fitting in a cylinder. Both thecylinders communicate with a large reservoir R, with elastic walls, which issupposed to be closed and filled with a light and incompressible fluid. Bystriking repeatedly one of the prongs of the tuning-fork F, the small piston pbelow would be vibrated, and its vibrations, transmitted through the fluid,would reach the distant fork F1, which is “tuned” to the fork F, or, statedotherwise, of exactly the same note as the latter. The fork F1 would now be setvibrating, and its vibration would be intensified by the continued action of thedistant fork F until its upper prong, swinging far out, would make an electricalconnection with a stationary contact c”, starting in this manner some electricalor other appliances which may be used for recording the signals. In this simpleway messages could be exchanged between the two stations, a similar contact c’being provided for this purpose, close to the upper prong of the fork F, so thatthe apparatus at each station could be employed in turn as receiver andtransmitter.The electrical system illustrated in the upper figure of diagram c is exactlythe same in principle, the two wires or circuits ESP and E1S1P1 , which extendvertically to a height, representing the two tuning-forks with the pistonsattached to them. These circuits are connected with the ground by plates E, E1 ,and to two elevated metal sheets P, P, which store elec tricity and thus magnifyconsiderably the effect. The closed reservoir R, with elastic walls, is in thiscase replaced by the earth, and the fluid by electricity. Both of these circuitsare “tuned” and operate just like the two tuning-forks. Instead of striking thefork F at the sending-station, electrical oscillations are produced in thevertical sending- or transmitting-wire ESP, as by the action of a source S,included in this wire, which spread through the ground and reach the distantvertical receiving-wire E1S1P1, exciting corresponding electrical oscillationsin the same. In the latter wire or circuit is included a sensitive device orreceiver S1 , which is thus set in action and made to operate a relay or otherappliance. Each station is, of course, provided both with a source of electricaloscillations S and a sensitive receiver S1 , and a simple provision is made forusing each of the two wires alternately to send and to receive the messages.The exact attunement of the two circuits secures great advantages, and, in fact,it is essential in the practical use of the system. In this respect many popularerrors exist, and, as a rule, in the technical reports on this subject circuitsand appliances are described as affording these advantages when from their verynature it is evident that this is impossible. In order to attain the bestresults it is essential that the length of each wire or circuit, from the groundconnection to the top, should be equal to one quarter of the wave-length of theelectrical vibration in the wire, or else equal to that length multiplied by anodd number. Without the observation of this rule it is virtually impossible toprevent the interference and insure the privacy of messages. Therein lies thesecret of tuning. To obtain the most satisfactory results it is, however,necessary to resort to electrical vibrations of low pitch. The Hertzian sparkapparatus, used generally by experimenters, which produces oscillations of avery high rate, permits no effective tuning, and slight disturbances aresufficient to render an exchange of messages impracticable. But scientificallydesigned, efficient appliances allow nearly perfect adjustment. An experimentperformed with the improved apparatus repeatedly referred to, and intended toconvey an idea of this feature, is illustrated in Fig. 5, which is sufficientlyexplained by its note.Since I described these simple principles of telegraphy without wires I have hadfrequent occasion to note that the identical features and elements have beenused, in the evident belief that the signals are being transmitted toconsiderable distances by “Hertzian” radiations. This is only one of manymisapprehensions to which the investigations of the lamented physicist havegiven rise. About thirty-three years ago Maxwell, following up a suggestiveexperiment made by Faraday in 1845, evolved an ideally simple theory whichintimately connected light, radiant heat, and electrical phenomena, interpretingthem as being all due to vibrations of a hypothetical fluid of inconceivabletenuity, called the ether. No experimental verification was arrived at untilHertz, at the suggestion of Helmholtz, undertook a series of experiments to thiseffect. Hertz proceeded with extraordinary ingenuity and insight, but devotedlittle energy to the perfection of his old-fashioned apparatus. The consequencewas that he failed to observe the important function which the air played in hisexperiments, and which I subsequently discovered. Repeating his experiments andreaching different results, I ventured to point out this oversight. The strengthof the proofs brought forward by Hertz in support of Maxwell’s theory resided inthe correct estimate of the rates of vibration of the circuits he used. But Iascertained that he could not have obtained the rates he thought he was getting.The vibrations with identical apparatus he employed are, as a rule, much slower,this being due to the presence of air, which produces a dampening effect upon arapidly vibrating electric circuit of high pressure, as a fluid does upon avibrating tuning-fork. I have, however, discovered since that time other causesof error, and I have long ago ceased to look upon his results as being anexperimental verification of the poetical conceptions of Maxwell. The work ofthe great German physicist has acted as an immense stimulus to contemporaryelectrical research, but it has likewise, in a measure, by its fascination,paralyzed the scientific mind, and thus hampered independent inquiry. Every newphenomenon which was discovered was made to fit the theory, and so very oftenthe truth has been unconsciously distorted.When I advanced this system of telegraphy, my mind was dominated by the idea ofeffecting communication to any distance through the earth or environing medium,the practical consummation of which I considered of transcendent importance,chiefly on account of the moral effect which it could not fail to produceuniversally. As the first effort to this end I proposed, at that time, to employrelay-stations with tuned circuits, in the hope of making thus practicablesignaling over vast distances, even with apparatus of very moderate power thenat my command. I was confident, however, that with properly designed machinerysignals could be transmitted to any point of the globe, no matter what thedistance, without the necessity of using such intermediate stations. I gainedthis conviction through the discovery of a singular electrical phenomenon, whichI described early in 1892, in lectures delivered before some scientificsocieties abroad, and which I have called a “rotating brush.” This is a bundleof light which is formed, under certain conditions, in a vacuum-bulb, and whichis of a sensitiveness to magnetic and electric influences bordering, so tospeak, on the supernatural. This light-bundle is rapidly rotated by the earth’smagnetism as many as twenty thousand times per second, the rotation in theseparts being opposite to what it would be in the southern hemisphere, while inthe region of the magnetic equator it should not rotate at all. In its mostsensitive state, which is difficult to attain, it is responsive to electric ormagnetic influences to an incredible degree. The mere stiffening of the musclesof the arm and consequent slight electrical change in the body of an observerstanding at some distance from it, will perceptibly affect it. When in thishighly sensitive state it is capable of indicating the slightest magnetic andelectric changes taking place in the earth. The observation of this wonderfulphenomenon impressed me strongly that communication at any distance could beeasily effected by its means, provided that apparatus could be perfected capableof producing an electric or magnetic change of state, however small, in theterrestrial globe or environing medium.DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW PRINCIPLE—THE ELECTRICAL OSCILLATOR—PRODUCTION OF IMMENSEELECTRICAL MOVEMENTS—THE EARTH RESPONDS TO MAN—INTERPLANETARY COMMUNICATION NOWPROBABLE.I resolved to concentrate my efforts upon this venturesome task, though itinvolved great sacrifice, for the difficulties to be mastered were such that Icould hope to consummate it only after years of labor. It meant delay of otherwork to which I would have preferred to devote myself, but I gained theconviction that my energies could not be more usefully employed; for Irecognized that an efficient apparatus for the production of powerful electricaloscillations, as was needed for that specific purpose, was the key to thesolution of other most important electrical and, in fact, human problems. Notonly was communication, to any distance, without wires possible by its means,but, likewise, the transmission of energy in great amounts, the burning of theatmospheric nitrogen, the production of an efficient illuminant, and many otherresults of inestimable scientific and industrial value. Finally, however, I hadthe satisfaction of accomplishing the task undertaken by the use of a newprinciple, the virtue of which is based on the marvelous properties of theelectrical condenser. One of these is that it can discharge or explode itsstored energy in an inconceivably short time. Owing to this it is unequaled inexplosive violence. The explosion of dynamite is only the breath of aconsumptive compared with its discharge. It is the means of producing thestrongest current, the highest electrical pressure, the greatest commotion inthe medium. Another of its properties, equally valuable, is that its dischargemay vibrate at any rate desired up to many millions per second.I had arrived at the limit of rates obtainable in other ways when the happy ideapresented itself to me to resort to the condenser. I arranged such an instrumentso as to be charged and discharged alternately in rapid succession through acoil with a few turns of stout wire, forming the primary of a transformer orinduction-coil. Each time the condenser was discharged the current would quiverin the primary wire and induce corresponding oscillations in the secondary. Thusa transformer or induction-coil on new principles was evolved, which I havecalled “the electrical oscillator,” partaking of those unique qualities whichcharacterize the condenser, and enabling results to be attained impossible byother means. Electrical effects of any desired character and of intensitiesundreamed of before are now easily producible by perfected apparatus of thiskind, to which frequent reference has been made, and the essential parts ofwhich are shown in Fig. 6. For certain purposes a strong inductive effect isrequired; for others the greatest possible suddenness; for others again, anexceptionally high rate of vibration or extreme pressure; while for certainother objects immense electrical movements are necessary. The photographs inFigs. 7, 8, 9, and 10, of experiments performed with such an oscillator, mayserve to illustrate some of these features and convey an idea of the magnitudeof the effects actually produced. The completeness of the titles of the figuresreferred to makes a further description of them unnecessary.However extraordinary the results shown may appear, they are but triflingcompared with those which are attainable by apparatus designed on these sameprinciples. I have produced electrical discharges the actual path of which, fromend to end, was probably more than one hundred feet long; but it would not bedifficult to reach lengths one hundred times as great. I have producedelectrical movements occurring at the rate of approximately one hundred thousandhorse-power, but rates of one, five, or ten million horse-power are easilypracticable. In these experiments effects were developed incomparably greaterthan any ever produced by human agencies, and yet these results are but anembryo of what is to be.That communication without wires to any point of the globe is practicable withsuch apparatus would need no demonstration, but through a discovery which I madeI obtained absolute certitude. Popularly explained, it is exactly this: When weraise the voice and hear an echo in reply, we know that the sound of the voicemust have reached a distant wall, or boundary, and must have been reflected fromthe same. Exactly as the sound, so an electrical wave is reflected, and the sameevidence which is afforded by an echo is offered by an electrical phenomenonknown as a “stationary” wave—that is, a wave with fixed nodal and ventralregions. Instead of sending sound-vibrations toward a distant wall, I have sentelectrical vibrations toward the remote boundaries of the earth, and instead ofthe wall the earth has replied. In place of an echo I have obtained a stationaryelectrical wave, a wave reflected from afar.Stationary waves in the earth mean something more than mere telegraphy withoutwires to any distance. They will enable us to attain many important specificresults impossible otherwise. For instance, by their use we may produce at will,from a sending-station, an electrical effect in any particular region of theglobe; we may determine the relative position or course of a moving object, suchas a vessel at sea, the distance traversed by the same, or its speed; or we maysend over the earth a wave of electricity traveling at any rate we desire, fromthe pace of a turtle up to lightning speed.With these developments we have every reason to anticipate that in a time notvery distant most telegraphic messages across the oceans will be transmittedwithout cables. For short distances we need a “wireless” telephone, whichrequires no expert operators. The greater the spaces to be bridged, the morerational becomes communication without wires. The cable is not only an easilydamaged and costly instrument, but it limits us in the speed of transmission byreason of a certain electrical property inseparable from its construction. Aproperly designed plant for effecting communication without wires ought to havemany times the working capacity of a cable, while it will involve incomparablyless expense. Not a long time will pass, I believe, before communication bycable will become obsolete, for not only will signaling by this new method bequicker and cheaper, but also much safer. By using some new means for isolatingthe messages which I have contrived, an almost perfect privacy can be secured.I have observed the above effects so far only up to a limited distance of aboutsix hundred miles, but inasmuch as there is virtually no limit to the power ofthe vibrations producible with such an oscillator, I feel quite confident of thesuccess of such a plant for effecting transoceanic communication. Nor is thisall. My measurements and calculations have shown that it is perfectlypracticable to produce on our globe, by the use of these principles, anelectrical movement of such magnitude that, without the slightest doubt, itseffect will be perceptible on some of our nearer planets, as Venus and Mars.Thus from mere possibility interplanetary communication has entered the stage ofprobability. In fact, that we can produce a distinct effect on one of theseplanets in this novel manner, namely, by disturbing the electrical condition ofthe earth, is beyond any doubt. This way of effecting such communication is,however, essentially different from all others which have so far been proposedby scientific men. In all the previous instances only a minute fraction of thetotal energy reaching the planet—as much as it would be possible to concentratein a reflector—could be utilized by the supposed observer in his instrument. Butby the means I have developed he would be enabled to concentrate the largerportion of the entire energy transmitted to the planet in his instrument, andthe chances of affecting the latter are thereby increased many millionfold.Besides machinery for producing vibrations of the required power, we must havedelicate means capable of revealing the effects of feeble influences exertedupon the earth. For such purposes, too, I have perfected new methods. By theiruse we shall likewise be able, among other things, to detect at considerabledistance the presence of an iceberg or other object at sea. By their use, also,I have discovered some terrestrial phenomena still unexplained. That we can senda message to a planet is certain, that we can get an answer is probable: man isnot the only being in the Infinite gifted with a mind.TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO ANY DISTANCE WITHOUT WIRES—NOWPRACTICABLE—THE BEST MEANS OF INCREASING THE FORCE ACCELERATING THE HUMAN MASS.The most valuable observation made in the course of these investigations was theextraordinary behavior of the atmosphere toward electric impulses of excessiveelectromotive force. The experiments showed that the air at the ordinarypressure became distinctly conducting, and this opened up the wonderful prospectof transmitting large amounts of electrical energy for industrial purposes togreat distances without wires, a possibility which, up to that time, was thoughtof only as a scientific dream. Further investigation revealed the important factthat the conductivity imparted to the air by these electrical impulses of manymillions of volts increased very rapidly with the degree of rarefaction, so thatair strata at very moderate altitudes, which are easily accessible, offer, toall experimental evidence, a perfect conducting path, better than a copper wire,for currents of this character.Thus the discovery of these new properties of the atmosphere not only opened upthe possibility of transmitting, without wires, energy in large amounts, but,what was still more significant, it afforded the certitude that energy could betransmitted in this manner economically. In this new system it matters little—infact, almost nothing—whether the transmission is effected at a distance of a fewmiles or of a few thousand miles.While I have not, as yet, actually effected a transmission of a considerableamount of energy, such as would be of industrial importance, to a great distanceby this new method, I have operated several model plants under exactly the sameconditions which will exist in a large plant of this kind, and thepracticability of the system is thoroughly demonstrated. The experiments haveshown conclusively that, with two terminals maintained at an elevation of notmore than thirty thousand to thirty-five thousand feet above sea-level, and withan electrical pressure of fifteen to twenty million volts, the energy ofthousands of horse-power can be transmitted over distances which may be hundredsand, if necessary, thousands of miles. I am hopeful, however, that I may be ableto reduce very considerably the elevation of the terminals now required, andwith this object I am following up an idea which promises such a realization.There is, of course, a popular prejudice against using an electrical pressure ofmillions of volts, which may cause sparks to fly at distances of hundreds offeet, but, paradoxical as it may seem, the system, as I have described it in atechnical publication, offers greater personal safety than most of the ordinarydistribution circuits now used in the cities. This is, in a measure, borne outby the fact that, although I have carried on such experiments for a number ofyears, no injury has been sustained either by me or any of my assistants.But to enable a practical introduction of the system, a number of essentialrequirements are still to be fulfilled. It is not enough to develop appliancesby means of which such a transmission can be effected. The machinery must besuch as to allow the transformation and transmission of electrical energy underhighly economical and practical conditions. Furthermore, an inducement must beoffered to those who are engaged in the industrial exploitation of naturalsources of power, as waterfalls, by guaranteeing greater returns on the capitalinvested than they can secure by local development of the property.From that moment when it was observed that, contrary to the established opinion,low and easily accessible strata of the atmosphere are capable of conductingelectricity, the transmission of electrical energy without wires has become arational task of the engineer, and one surpassing all others in importance. Itspractical consummation would mean that energy would be available for the uses ofman at any point of the globe, not in small amounts such as might be derivedfrom the ambient medium by suitable machinery, but in quantities virtuallyunlimited, from waterfalls. Export of power would then become the chief sourceof income for many happily situated countries, as the United States, Canada,Central and South America, Switzerland, and Sweden. Men could settle downeverywhere, fertilize and irrigate the soil with little effort, and convertbarren deserts into gardens, and thus the entire globe could be transformed andmade a fitter abode for mankind. It is highly probable that if there areintelligent beings on Mars they have long ago realized this very idea, whichwould explain the changes on its surface noted by astronomers. The atmosphere onthat planet, being of considerably smaller density than that of the earth, wouldmake the task much more easy.It is probable that we shall soon have a self-acting heat-engine capable ofderiving moderate amounts of energy from the ambient medium. There is also apossibility—though a small one—that we may obtain electrical energy direct fromthe sun. This might be the case if the Maxwellian theory is true, according towhich electrical vibrations of all rates should emanate from the sun. I am stillinvestigating this subject. Sir William Crookes has shown in his beautifulinvention known as the “radiometer” that rays may produce by impact a mechanicaleffect, and this may lead to some important revelation as to the utilization ofthe sun’s rays in novel ways. Other sources of energy may be opened up, and newmethods of deriving energy from the sun discovered, but none of these or similarachievements would equal in importance the transmission of power to any distancethrough the medium. I can conceive of no technical advance which would tend tounite the various elements of humanity more effectively than this one, or of onewhich would more add to and more economize human energy. It would be the bestmeans of increasing the force accelerating the human mass. The mere moralinfluence of such a radical departure would be incalculable. On the other hand,if at any point of the globe energy can be obtained in limited quantities fromthe ambient medium by means of a self-acting heat-engine or otherwise, theconditions will remain the same as before. Human performance will be increased,but men will remain strangers as they were.I anticipate that many, unprepared for these results, which, through longfamiliarity, appear to me simple and obvious, will consider them still far frompractical application. Such reserve, and even opposition, of some is as useful aquality and as necessary an element in human progress as the quick receptivityand enthusiasm of others. Thus, a mass which resists the force at first, onceset in movement, adds to the energy. The scientific man does not aim at animmediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readilytaken up. His work is like that of the planter—for the future. His duty is tolay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way. He lives andlabors and hopes with the poet who says:Schaff’, das Tagwerk meiner Hände,Hohes Glück, dass ich’s vollende!Lass, o lass mich nicht ermatten!Nein, es sind nicht leere Träume:Jetzt nur Stangen, diese BäumeGeben einst noch Frucht und Schatten.3[tesl_9781101565698_oeb_ftn_r1.xhtml#FTN-3]"},{"pageContent":"THE STORY OF PENGUIN CLASSICSBefore 1946 . . . “Classics” are mainly the domain of academics and students;readable editions for everyone else are almost unheard of.
