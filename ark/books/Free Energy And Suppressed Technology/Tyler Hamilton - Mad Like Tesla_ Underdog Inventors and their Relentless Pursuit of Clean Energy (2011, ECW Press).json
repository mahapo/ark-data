It can never be done. It is impossible. It will never beaccepted.How often, throughout modern history, have those words been spoken? There aredozens of classic examples. Physicist and engineer Lord Kelvin, president of theBritish Royal Society, famously said back in the late 1800s that“heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible” and “x-rays will prove to be ahoax.” Albert Einstein said in 1932 that he couldn’t see nuclear energy everbeing obtainable. Tunis Craven, in his role as commissioner of the U.S. FederalCommunications Commission in 1961, spoke a few years prematurely when hedismissed the future prospect of communications satellites. “There ispractically no chance communications space satellites will be used to providebetter telephone, telegraph, television, or radio service inside the UnitedStates,” pronounced Craven, only to be proven wrong when the satellite Syncom 3transmitted television signals from Japan to the United States, giving Americanslive foreign coverage of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Many theoretical physicistsduring the late 1960s and ’70s said nuclear magnetic resonance technology, firstdiscovered in the 1930s, could not be adapted to detect cancers and otherdiseases in the human body. A New York physician named Raymond Damadian ignoredthe naysayers and built his own body scanner. In 1977 he successfully performedthe first full-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam on a human. Receivingan award from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001, Damadian saidcriticism and skepticism come with the territory of invention and innovation:“The bolder the initiative, the harsher the criticism.”1 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-1]A gracious response, but I rather like the comment by Time magazine writer LevGrossman, “There’s nothing like the passage of time to make the world’s smartestpeople look like complete idiots.”2 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-2]In the area of energy technology and systems, it’s arguable that no one has beendoubted, underestimated, or challenged more than Serbian-American engineerNikola Tesla (1856–1943), and perhaps no innovator has proven so many peoplewrong over the past 100 years. His best-known invention was the alternatingcurrent (AC) induction motor, patented in 1888, which became crucial to thesubsequent development of high-voltage AC power systems that could distributeelectricity over long distances. Direct current (DC) systems of the day, bycomparison, were limited because they produced electricity that had to beconsumed within a couple of kilometers of where it was generated. Teslaappreciated early in his life the benefits of AC and the shortfalls of DC, andhe first began formulating his AC motor designs as a student at the AustrianPolytechnic School in Graz. One day, after sharing his thoughts with a professorhe greatly respected, the young Tesla, in his early 20s, was promptly rebuffedin front of his peers. “Mr. Tesla may accomplish great things,” his professorquipped, “but he will never do this . . . It’s a perpetual motion machine, animpossible idea.”3 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-3] Of course, what Tesla described hadnothing to do with perpetual motion. Yet his professor, unable to grasp theconcept, did not hesitate to lump it into the category reserved for loonyinventions.A few years later, while walking in a park late one afternoon with a friend,Tesla said a clear design for his motor shot into his head “like a flash oflightning.” He found a stick and began drawing diagrams in the dirt. Six yearslater, he formally revealed the design to the American Institute of ElectricalEngineers, though the battle to have it more widely accepted was justbeginning.4 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-4] As he forged on and turned his idea into aworking prototype, he faced resistance from American inventor Thomas Edison, whosaw all inventions around alternating current as a threat to the low-voltage,direct-current systems he was developing and from which he was collectinghandsome royalties. “Fooling around with alternating current is just a waste oftime,” said Edison in 1889. “Nobody will use it, ever.” To discourage its use,Edison declared high-voltage AC systems unsafe and lobbied the U.S. governmentto ban the technology on those grounds.5 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-5] He drove themessage home by funding a vicious public relations campaign that involvedelectrocuting dogs and other animals — including an elephant — with AC current.His campaign didn’t work, of course, and AC power generation and transmissionsystems based on Tesla’s designs eventually came to dominance around the world.It wasn’t an impossible waste of time after all.I first became fascinated with the life and work of Nikola Tesla 10 years agowhile researching a story marking the 100th anniversary of Guglielmo Marconi’sfirst transatlantic wireless communication. On December 12, 1901, the letter “S”was transmitted in Morse code from a wireless transmission station in Cornwall,United Kingdom, to Signal Hill in St. John’s, a city in the Canadian province ofNewfoundland and Labrador. The 3,500-kilometer transmission across the AtlanticOcean was hailed as a great moment in science and eventually led to Marconibeing branded as “The Father of Radio.” It’s a nice story, except for the factthat Tesla was the true father of radio. Tesla filed his first radio patents in1896, five years before Marconi, and when Marconi did file to the U.S. patentoffice, it initially rejected his application for being too similar to thosesubmitted by Tesla. It was only when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the patentissue nearly 50 years later, in 1943 just a few months after Tesla’s death, thatthe matter was settled for good: Tesla invented radio.The more I dug into the life of Tesla, the more I realized how much hisinventions and vision influenced the 20th century and continue to do so in ourcurrent century. In 1898 he demonstrated a remote-controlled robotic boat thatheralded the beginning of remote-controlled electronics and multichannelbroadcasting. Tesla called it “teleautomation” and referred to his boat as “thefirst of a race of robots — mechanical men which will do the laborious work ofthe human race.” Learning this gave new meaning to the remote-controlled,battery-powered Spiderman helicopter I fly with my kids in the basement, thoughthe larger influence is obvious — everything from the Mars Rover to unmanneddrone planes to cruise missiles.6 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-6] To those watching thedemonstration in 1898, Tesla’s invention seemed powered by pure magic. “Skepticshad him pull the lid to prove there wasn’t a midget operating inside,” accordingto documentarian Robert Uth.7 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-7] But there was littlefinancial interest in the idea at the time, and Tesla explained such reluctanceto invest — and even hostility to the concept — when he requested developmentfunds from American millionaire John Jacob Astor IV. “It is for a reason that Iam often and viciously attacked,” he wrote in a letter to Astor, “because myintentions threaten a number of established industries.”8 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-8]Astor, who went down with the Titanic in 1912 at the age of 47, would only livelong enough to get a taste of how Tesla’s robot race would evolve.There seems to be no end to Tesla’s accomplishments. He is credited in hindsightfor perfecting neon and fluorescent lighting, for the earliest work in wirelesspower transmission, for taking the world’s first x-ray photographs, and forproposing the basic principles of radar technology two decades before its“official” invention.9 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-9] Even his ability to create“lightning balls” in the laboratory has inspired research into plasma physicsand nuclear fusion. An inventor and visionary, Tesla was also anenvironmentalist at heart who understood the long-term implications of burningfossil fuels, the supply of which would eventually run out. Non-renewableresources such as coal and oil should be conserved, he argued, and solar energy— either acquired directly or indirectly by capturing energy in the wind —should be fully exploited. At age 75, he published designs of two renewableenergy extraction methods in the December 1931 issue of Everyday Science andMechanics. One was an early design of a geothermal power plant of the sort builttoday to extract heat from deep underground for clean electricity production.The second was a way to generate electricity from the temperature differentialin ocean waters.Essentially, a heat exchanger would extract heat out of the warmer upper oceanlayers and create steam from a working fluid with a low boiling temperature,such as ammonia. The steam would drive a turbine that generates electricity.Cold water from deeper layers would then be used to condense the ammonia backinto fluid, at which point the cycle would be repeated. It seemed an unpracticaland somewhat wonky concept at the time, and Tesla himself struggled to make itefficient enough to be worthwhile. But the idea, today called ocean thermalenergy conversion (OTEC), lives on. Military contractor Lockheed Martin has beenworking away on the technology since the 1970s and is now constructing a10-megawatt OTEC pilot plant off the coast of Hawaii that could be in operationby 2013. It would generate enough power for 10,000 homes. “I dream of thousandsof floating OTEC ships roaming the seas of the world, providing an inexhaustiblesupply of clean energy and fuel and water for all people of the world,”explained an enthusiastic Ted Johnson, director of alternative energydevelopment at Lockheed.10 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-10] It’s a comment Tesla mighthave made 100 years ago.It’s no wonder Tesla is regarded today as one of the greatest inventors andthinkers of the 20th century. But the label only took hold many years after hisdeath. And it didn’t come without a fight. In many respects, he was an underdoghis entire career, despite his lifelong creativity and brilliance. Born July 10,1856, in the Croatian village of Smiljan, the young Nikola was a sickly andquirky child who developed many phobias and obsessions that were carried intoadulthood. When he walked, he couldn’t help but count his steps. When servedmeals, he was compelled to calculate in his mind the cubic contents of cups andbowls. He also had a problem touching people’s hair and, generally, had a phobiaof germs. The sight of earrings dangling from a woman’s earlobes disgusted him,especially if they were pearls. This developed much later in life into otherobsessive-compulsive behaviors, most notably a fixation on the number three. Heoften walked around the block three times before entering a building, or hewould demand that certain items be sent to him in threes. Such eccentricbehavior may explain why Tesla never married or engaged in romanticrelationships during his life. Poor and feeble in his final years, his onlyknown “love” was a white pigeon that would regularly visit his apartment. It wasduring these final years that Tesla also spoke openly about a future that mostpeople could not imagine, let alone believe.According to the documentarian Uth, “Newspaper reporters, looking for a laugh,would attend to listen to the crazy old man’s outlandish predictions of wirelesstelephones, communication with other life forms in the cosmos, beam weapons thatcould shoot down airplanes and missiles, and many more science fiction conceptsthat are now becoming reality.” Instead of being hailed as a genius andbrilliant inventor, Tesla was increasingly thought of as a “mad scientist” inthe minds of the general public and in popular culture. In 1941, the firstSuperman cartoon movies, for example, had the Man of Steel fighting a madscientist named Tesla and his city-destroying “electrothanasia ray,”representing Tesla’s real-life work on a particle beam that could be used as aweapon of war. Perhaps Tesla seeded such perceptions of madness as early as 1901when he claimed he had been in communication with Mars, implying some sort ofback-and-forth chatter with extraterrestrials. Conspiracy theorists suggest suchcommunications informed Tesla’s reported early awareness of rising carbondioxide levels in Earth’s atmosphere and how it was causing global warming.11[e00_TESLA5.html#x1-11] Needless to say, Tesla was just as often a target ofridicule as he was of praise. “He was a really weird dude,” Amory Lovins, chiefscientist and co-founder of the Rocky Mountain Institute in Colorado, told meone day while I was researching this book. “He probably would have been in amental institution today.”One wonders how many brilliant minds are undiscovered, locked away or medicated,and to what extent our aversion to “weird dudes” puts a cap on innovation.Another question is whether Tesla’s strange ways contributed in a way to hisgenius, or whether it was his genius that led to his strange ways. I keep comingback to a line in the Francis Ford Coppola movie Rumble Fish, in which DennisHopper’s character answers a not-so-simple question from his son Rusty James(Matt Dillon): was mom crazy? “Every now and then a person comes along that hasa different view of the world than does the usual person,” says Hopper’scharacter. “It doesn’t make them crazy. I mean, an acute perception, man — thatdoesn’t make you crazy. However, sometimes it can drive you crazy.” What we knowis that Tesla’s acute perception of the world around him informed a kind ofthinking that most others could not easily grasp or appreciate. To bemisunderstood can make one appear mad in the eyes of others. But beingmisunderstood, over time, is just as likely to drive one mad.A voracious reader, a lover of poetry, and a man blessed with a photographicmemory, Tesla somehow managed to balance his eccentric ways with socialacceptance for most of his life. Mark Twain enjoyed hanging around him, and thetwo became close friends. The social elite of New York City, where Tesla lived,loved to rub elbows with the strange-but-fascinating inventor who had a lovelyaccent and slim build. But, ultimately, the Serbian-American engineer was aloner both in how he lived and in his head. He kept ideas locked up inside hismind and, to the frustration of many, did not collaborate well with otherengineers and scientists. His ideas and achievements were his and his alone, aswas his struggle to have those innovations accepted by society. This isolation,and the fact that he has proven so many skeptics wrong over the years, hasendeared Tesla to many inventors and entrepreneurs who identify with hisstruggle. “The example set by Tesla has always been particularly inspiring tothe lone runner,” wrote Margaret Cheney, author of Tesla: Man Out of Time.Indeed, one of the inventor’s 21st century namesakes is electric car maker TeslaMotors, which relies on a modern version of Nikola Tesla’s “polyphase” AC motordesign. The company’s Tesla Roadster is a $109,000 battery-powered sports carwith a 230-mile range and acceleration that can leave a Porsche in its dust. Itsearly critics considered it a flash in the pan — a shiny, fast toy for theuber-rich that won’t last beyond its initial buzz. Many still view the companythis way. As a pioneer of electric cars, and the first automaker born out ofSilicon Valley, Tesla Motors is very much a lone runner that’s used to beingtold “it can never been done” and “it will never be accepted.” Yet the company,like the inventor, has not been discouraged by the naysayers. This is made clearon its corporate website: “The critics said it couldn’t be done, yet we arehere, taking nothing for granted. We challenge custom and question tradition.Our drivers benefit from it.” Since Tesla Motors emerged on the scene, mostmajor automakers, including those that declared electric cars a short-lived fad,have announced plans for their own all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Theglobal transition to electrified transportation is building momentum, and it’snow viewed by many as almost inevitable.This book explores some of the other “lone runners” out there who I haveidentified during my six years as an energy reporter and clean technologycolumnist for the Toronto Star, Canada’s largest daily newspaper, and as afrequent contributor to MIT’s Technology Review. I titled it Mad Like Teslabecause, in my observation, the companies and individuals profiled here havereason to identify with Nikola Tesla, the man. They are considered — or havebeen considered — crazy because of the perceived impossibility orunacceptability of what they’re attempting to do, and yet they forge ahead in aninhospitable marketplace driven largely by a desire to do right and a convictionthat they are right. In this sense, they are mad like Tesla — not becausewomen’s earrings make them vomit or they claim to have communicated withMartians, but because of how easily society dismisses their potentiallygame-changing efforts and because of the barriers they face along theirjourneys. The barriers are many: scientific groupthink, bad timing, entrenchedcorporate interests, misplaced public fear, gaps in available technology, highcost, resource scarcity, personality clashes, lack of financing, resistance tochange, complacency, competitive rivalry, misguided policy, lack of vision, andgeneral ignorance — to name just a few. Many of these barriers will be discussedin the chapters that follow. “It’s a surprise some people ever start,” industrywatcher Rick Whittaker once told me. He’s the chief technology and investmentofficer at Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC), a federal grantingagency created to support clean technology demonstration projects. Hundreds offunding applications cross Whittaker’s desk each year. Many deserving ideas slipthrough the cracks. Those persistent or lucky enough to get funding are only atthe beginning of a very long road. The casualty rate is high.So why did I write this book? Humanity is on an unsustainable path, and changingcourse will require a dramatic rethink of how we obtain and use energy. We needto be more open minded. We need to take more chances. The individuals andcompanies profiled in the chapters that follow play a crucial role in our energyfuture, even if they fail. That’s because, like Tesla, they still succeed byleading, by taking risks, by pursuing great leaps, and by keeping open mindswhen others remain so closed. They stand in contrast to monolithic corporationswith disciplined management cultures and an aversion to disruptive technology.As U.S. inventor Dean Kamen, creator of the Segway scooter, once said, “Goodmanagement tries to eliminate surprise, therefore good management eliminatesinnovation.” Fact is we need the lone runner, be it a passionate individual oran aggressive startup that doesn’t stop at “no” and isn’t satisfied with takingbaby steps. But who are these people? What drives them? What goes through theirminds? Though we see the sensational headlines that briefly shine a light ontheir unusual technologies — the so-called 15 minutes of fame — too often theseinnovators’ stories and their contributions to the world fade into thebackground. The real learning comes out of the journey behind the headline.But let’s be clear: the nimble and creative David isn’t guaranteed to come upwith a better concept or technology than a slow and stifled Goliath. Even Teslahad his duds, as author Judy Wearing illustrates so well in her book, Edison’sConcrete Piano. Tesla’s “earthquake machine” wasn’t of much value, and hiscosmic theories aimed at refuting Einstein’s theory of relativity were well offthe mark. I also don’t want to suggest that simply proving a ground-breakingidea both technologically possible and superior is all it takes to earn rapidacceptance, as writer Vaclav Smil discusses in his book Energy Myths andRealities. “Wishful thinking, pioneering enthusiasm, and belief in the efficacyof seemingly superior solutions are not enough to change the fundamental natureof gradually unfolding energy transitions, be they shifts to new fuels, to newmodes of electricity generation, or to new prime movers,” wrote Smil. His pointis well taken. Pieces of an energy system aren’t iPod-like gadgets with asix-month shelf life. They are part of a massive infrastructure that has cometogether over several decades at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars.Meaningful change on a global scale will take many decades more, so we’ll needto temper passion with patience.Energy expert David Fridley, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley NationalLaboratory in California, writes that too many of us underestimate the gruelingpath to commercialization, even for truly breakthrough energy technologies.“Processes need to be perfected and optimized, patents developed, demonstrationtests performed, pilot plants built and evaluated, environmental impactsassessed, and engineering, design, siting, financing, economic and other studiesare undertaken. In other words, technologies that are proved feasible on thebench-top today will likely have little impact until the 2030s.”12[e00_TESLA5.html#x1-12] It’s also not a sure thing that a new game-changingtechnology can be scaled up enough to have the kind of global impact that’sexpected. Maybe it relies on a rare-earth metal that’s in very short supply oris limited by geography or needs to consume huge volumes of fresh water at atime when water is increasingly scarce. These variables must be carefullyweighed and considered.With all of that duly noted, in Chapter 1 you’ll meet Michel Laberge, aQuebec-born engineer who worked for a high-tech commercial printing companyuntil he turned 40 and had what he considers a mid-life crisis. Most men wouldbuy a Porsche and start dyeing their graying hair. Not Laberge. He decided todedicate his life to building a nuclear fusion power reactor on the cheap. HisVancouver-based company, General Fusion, is trying to do with tens of millionsof dollars what government-led projects in Europe and North America arestruggling to do with tens of billions. He understood the odds were against himwhen he started, but ask him today and he’ll tell you it’s a 50–50 bet and theodds are getting better every day. If he pulls it off, clean and cheap nuclearpower without the toxic waste just might be a reality in our lifetime.Chapter 2 introduces you to a California company that wants to go where no powerplant has gone before — space. Solar photovoltaic technology has been used fordecades to power satellites, but Gary Spirnak wants to take an idea firstproposed by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov in 1941 and — in the words ofnext-gen Star Trek captain Jean-Luc Picard — make it so. A square kilometersolar collector would be launched into orbit about 36,000 kilometers above thesurface of the Earth, clear of clouds and facing the sun 24 hours a day. Theenergy collected would be beamed by microwave down to a massive receivingstation in the middle of a desert, converted into electricity, and put on thepower grid. Sounds crazy, I’ll admit. Spirnak, founder of Solaren Corporation,admits it’s an enormous endeavor that invites ridicule, but, as an engineer andveteran of the U.S. space industry, he is convinced it can be done with currenttechnology and that the electricity produced will be competitively priced.As Solaren works toward harnessing solar energy from space, Louis Michaud iscaught up in the idea of tornado power. The retired refinery engineer from apart of Ontario, Canada, known as “chemical valley” has spent much of his adultlife studying how temperature differentials between the ground and thetroposphere lead to the creation of tornados, dust devils, and, over the ocean,water spouts. These naturally occurring vortices contain immense amounts ofenergy. In Chapter 3 you’ll find out how Michaud wants to harness that energy bycreating man-made tornados that would “survive” using waste heat from industryor the warm ocean waters of the tropics. He calls his invention the atmosphericvortex engine, and while a small-scale version proves the concept works —including a prototype built in Michaud’s garage — taking it to the next levelhas been his greatest challenge.Finding new ways to generate clean electricity is only part of the challenge theworld faces. We also need to use less energy to accomplish the work we desire,and some inventors are taking their cues from nature. Like Australianentrepreneur Jay Harman, who observed early in his life that certain shapes andpatterns found naturally in the world — the swirling of ocean kelp, the crosssection of nautilus seashells, the shape and movement of tornados — exist for areason. Simply put, they’re more efficient at managing the flow of fluid or air.In Chapter 4 you’ll learn about Harman’s company, PAX Scientific, and hisfrustrating attempts to convince the captains of industry, and investors, thateverything from fans and turbines to pumps and mixers can be made dramaticallymore efficient. You’ll also be introduced to the emerging field of biomimicry,as well as a number of other inventors who, like Harman, are borrowing fromMother Nature’s cookbook.The sustainability imperative also has us targeting humanity’s addiction to oil,which according to the International Energy Agency represents roughly 30 percentof the world’s primary fuel mix, most of it guzzled by the transportationsector.13 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-13] Yes, electric vehicles are on the way, butmany will be plug-in hybrids that still burn gasoline, and their introductioninto use will start slowly. Also, airplanes can’t fly on battery power. Therewill remain a need for green fuel alternatives, such as ethanol, a multi-purposesubstance which can also replace the use of environmentally harmfulpetrochemicals in the making of plastics and other materials. In Chapter 5 wevisit a Florida startup called Algenol that has come up with a clever way togrow ethanol-producing algae on an industrial scale. There is no shortage todayof algae-to-fuel ventures, but most grow algae so they can be harvested — thatis, killed — and squeezed of their natural oils. Algenol treats algae more likedairy cows. It grows them on a steady diet of sunlight and carbon dioxide andthen milks them. Paul Woods came up with the unusual idea during the 1980s whenhe was just 22, but nobody then believed it could be done. He stayed at it,self-funding the project over the years with help from friends and family. TodayAlgenol is one of the most innovative biofuel companies on the market, and itsapproach to producing green fuel from algae could end up setting a standard forthe industry. But Woods’ journey, as you’ll read, has in many ways just begun.Better technologies for storing electricity could also significantly reducehumanity’s dependence on oil, not to mention coal and natural gas. That’s thesolution Dick Weir is targeting. The co-founder of Texas startup EEStor,explored in Chapter 6, is working on what he claims will be the ultimate energystorage device, capable of keeping an electric vehicle charged during a500-kilometer drive or storing huge amounts of energy from the sun and wind soit can be dispatched as needed. Laptops, power tools, and other gadgets would beable to run for weeks on a single charge. A game-changing development? Yes. Butis it viable? Many engineers and scientists have their doubts. EEStor and itscrusty founder are secretive, stay clear of the media, and don’t like beingrushed. All of this has shrouded the company in mystery, attracting a mix offans and critics and the kind of Internet gossip typically associated withcelebrities like Paris Hilton. Energy storage is widely recognized as the nutthat needs to be cracked if we are to see renewable energy become a seriousthreat to fossil fuels. EEStor intends to crack it, despite the army of skepticswho seemingly wish it to fail.Skepticism is integral to science and invention, as there is no shortage offolks who claim to have discovered some variation on perpetual motion. Can a lawof physics be broken? Do we know all there is to know? These are divisivequestions in the scientific community, and debate can take on a religious tone.This is the territory we enter in Chapter 7, where you’ll be introduced to ThaneHeins and his controversial Perepiteia Generator. Does it put out more powerthan it consumes, as Heins claims? It’s impossible, according to the laws ofphysics, yet in laboratory demonstrations the behavior of his machine hasstumped believers and skeptics alike. Heins is an unlikely inventor, but, asTesla once said of himself, he has the “boldness of ignorance.” His endeavor mayturn out a fool’s voyage, but with fans like legendary rocker Neil Young in hiscorner — seriously, Neil Young — the memories will certainly be precious.Finally, I end the book by posing this question: can tech-boom billionaires andthe pioneering spirit of Silicon Valley accelerate our transition to alow-carbon economy? There’s a belief out there that investors and entrepreneurswho got rich from huge bets in computing, the Internet, and telecommunications —and transformed each industry seemingly overnight — can do the same with energy;that their growing economic influence can speed up the acceptance and adoptionof clean energy technologies that might otherwise be ignored by big industry.Acknowledging that their participation can only help, I wonder if the technologyworld’s top venture capitalists, wealthiest entrepreneurs, and most seasonedexecutives have overestimated their own influence and underestimated the energychallenge. Ultimately, it may be “Black Swans” that determine our energydestiny.The stories you are about to read concern science and technology with a splashof business and economics and a dash of recent history. To stretch the cookinganalogy, it’s all served up on a platter of human interest with a side order ofTesla. The occasional link back to Nikola Tesla reminds us that the obstacles toenergy innovations that existed 100 years ago remain in the 21st century. At thesame time, it’s important to recognize that the economic and environmentaldrivers of innovation are arguably very different today; there was nosustainability imperative driving invention in the early 1900s.In Tesla’s time there was certainly little, if any, awareness of climate changeand the risks of using our atmosphere as a dumping ground for carbon dioxide andother greenhouse gases. We know now that dependence on fossil fuels on anincreasingly crowded planet is not sustainable, and that human-caused climatechange is contributing to extreme weather, record high temperatures, the meltingof the Arctic and glaciers, and the mass extinction of species on land and inwater. A July 2010 report from the U.S. National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration made this disturbingly clear. Scientists collected data from 160research groups in 48 countries to get a comprehensive picture of how risinggreenhouse-gas concentrations are affecting the planet. Going back in some casesmore than 100 years, they identified an unmistakable trend. Air temperature overland and sea is going up, ocean surface temperature is rising, sea levels arerising, humidity is getting worse, and the troposphere continues to warm.Meanwhile, we’re seeing clear evidence of declining Arctic sea ice, retreatingglaciers, and decreasing spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere. The years2000 to 2009 were also declared the hottest decade on record.14[e00_TESLA5.html#x1-14] “Climate change is occurring, is caused largely by humanactivities, and poses significant risks for — and in many cases, is alreadyaffecting — a broad range of human and natural systems,” warned another report,released just two months earlier, from the prestigious U.S. National Academy ofSciences.15 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-15]I will never forget a private meeting I attended in Toronto on May 8, 2009, withBritish scientist James Lovelock, whose Gaia theory explains the Earth’sbiosphere as a self-regulating entity quite capable of adapting to climatechange. Humans, however, will be, in his view, a casualty of that adaptation.Commenting on the impact of climate change over the next few decades, Lovelock,two months shy of his 90th birthday, painted a shockingly grim picture.“Anything that overgrows its resources gets smacked back down,” he told us. “Iforesee a loss of as much as 80 or 90 percent of the people on Earth by the endof the century. It’s a distinct possibility, and I don’t think there is much wecan do to stop it. You have to make sure those who remain will be able tosurvive it.” I still recall looking around that room at a dozen or so peopleseized with despair as they listened to this otherwise lovable old man throw inthe towel on behalf of humanity.16 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-16] Lovelock’sperspective may be extreme in its hopelessness, but you get the picture — we’reheading in the wrong direction on energy and need to change how we use it andwhere we get it.Harvard University professor John Holdren, science and technology advisor toU.S. President Barack Obama and a former president of the American Associationfor the Advancement of Science, put it succinctly when he outlined the threechoices we have in our faceoff against climate change: mitigation, adaptation,or suffering. “We’re going to do some of each,” he said. “The question is whatthe mix is going to be. The more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will berequired and the less suffering there will be.”17 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-17] Theneed to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, become more efficient in how we useenergy, and increase our use of low-carbon technologies — the core part of anymitigation strategy — has sparked an era of energy innovation that even NikolaTesla would find unimaginable. “Scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs acrossthe globe are responding with unprecedented innovation,” according toChristopher Flavin, president of the Worldwatch Institute, an energy andenvironmental think tank based out of Washington, D.C. “Overnight, the energybusiness has begun to resemble the IT industry more than it does the energyindustry of the past.”18 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-18]Another motivating factor relates to energy security. There’s a growingrecognition out there that the fossil fuels we have come to depend on to powerour economies are going to become more expensive and, from a price perspective,more volatile. I don’t think we’ll ever run out of fossil fuels, even thoughthey are non-renewable. That’s because the cost of finding and extracting andbringing them to market is only going one way: up. We’ll simply start using lessand less as they lose their competitive edge over alternative energy sources ortechnologies that help us use energy more efficiently. Creating climate policiesthat put a meaningful price on carbon will only accelerate this transition. “Itshould be apparent by now that the future is not going to look like the present.It simply cannot,” wrote geoscientist J. David Hughes, who spent 32 years as ascientist with the Geological Survey of Canada.19 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-19] Takeoil — the cheap, easy-to-drill stuff is running out, and increasingly we’rerelying on the more expensive sources that are harder and more energy-intensiveto extract, where they’re not kept off limits to exploration. With China, India,and other emerging economies jacking up demand for fossil fuels, our currentsituation is not sustainable. “The party’s coming to an end,” warned Hughes.This battle against climate change and concern over the rising volatility offossil fuel markets, together with projections that the world’s population willreach nine billion by 2050, have major economic implications. One, which Britisheconomist Nicholas Stern drew attention to in 2006, is the cost of inaction thatunder a worse-case scenario would amount to trillions of dollars of lost globalGDP.20 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-20] The cost of action would be small by comparison,Stern concluded. The second economic implication relates to the new industriesand technologies — and jobs — that will be created as we tackle these growingproblems. Already, countries are jockeying for position to become global leadersin a new “green economy,” and clean technology is the world’s fastest growinginvestment segment. “The green economy is poised to be the mother of allmarkets, the economic investment opportunity of a lifetime, because it hasbecome so fundamental,” Lois Quam, founder of strategic consulting firm Tysvarand former managing director of venture capital firm Piper Jaffray, told NewYork Times columnist Thomas Friedman. “To find an equivalent economictransformation, you have to go back to the Industrial Revolution.”21[e00_TESLA5.html#x1-21]Clearly, there’s never been a greater need for new ideas and risk-taking, evenin the presence of what may seem impossible or unlikely. Tesla, if he livedtoday and wasn’t trapped in a mental institution, would have been in hiselement. Does this “need” mean the transition to clean energy sources andtechnologies will come faster than past energy transitions? It remains to beseen. What is becoming evident is that the energy transition currently in playisn’t about moving from one dominant fuel or technology to another; it’s aboutmoving from a handful of dominant sources to hundreds. “My strategy on energytechnology is to build robustness, to build a portfolio,” says SDTC’s Whittaker.“Is there a single technology that’s going to save us? I wouldn’t count on it.It’s got to be a whole bunch of little things.” We like to think about silverbullets, but, to borrow what is perhaps an overused analogy, we should bethinking about silver buckshot — small projectiles moving together and capableof hitting a much wider target. And we don’t need to wait for new breakthroughsbefore we pull the trigger. Much can be accomplished over the next two decadesby more aggressively deploying technologies we have today, including wind,co-generation, geothermal, solar-thermal power, solar photovoltaics,all-electric and hybrid-electric vehicles, second-generation biofuels, andground-source heat pumps. (For context, discussion of some of these technologiesis included in the chapters that follow.) Just as important are the policiesneeded to support their widespread deployment. “You need intelligent governmentregulations infinitely more than you need a massive effort to find breakthroughtechnologies,” says climate blogger Joseph Romm, who was acting assistantsecretary of the U.S. Department of Energy during the Clinton administration.22[e00_TESLA5.html#x1-22]I agree with Romm: the search for breakthroughs shouldn’t distract us from whatwe can and must accomplish now. At the same time, the hunt for truebreakthroughs, as rare as they may be, is still necessary to sustain us over thelong term. We need both leaps and incremental steps. The individual effortsprofiled in this book may prove an “impossible waste of time.” They may lead todead ends. Whatever the outcome, there is immense value in the journey. Theleft-behind morsels of innovations won’t necessarily go to waste. They can bepicked up and used by others who embark on their own ambitious journeys. Butthere’s also a chance these efforts will lead to triumph. And perhaps years, butlikely decades, from now we or our children will know, in hindsight, the degreeto which these innovators’ labors improved our lives.Interviewed for an article that appeared on August 22, 1937, in the New YorkHerald Tribune, Tesla — 81 years old at the time, less than six years before hisdeath — looked back on his life and seemed quite satisfied that he hadrepeatedly proved his doubters wrong. “They laughed in 1896 . . . when I toldthem about cosmic rays. They jeered 35 years ago when I discovered the rotatingfield principle of alternating currents. They called me crazy when I predictedthe radio. And when I sent the first impulse around the world, they said itcouldn’t be done.”23 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1-23]They have often been wrong.NOTES:1 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1x1] MIT press release (April 24, 2001) announcing RaymondDamadian’s lifetime achievement award.2 [e00_TESLA5.html#x1x2] Lev Grossman, “Forward Thinking,” Time.

It’s keeping everything alive — plants,bugs, bacteria, viruses, algae, fish, elephants, everything. Just look to thesky on a sunny day and you’ll see the source. It’s called the sun, which inessence is just an unfathomably massive nuclear fusion machine. Itsgravitational pull is so intense that the pressure exerted on its inner core ofgases — mostly hydrogen — keeps the temperature at around 15 million degreesCelsius, more than hot enough to trigger reactions that fuse hydrogen nucleiinto heavier helium nuclei. When that happens, things go boom. The sun emits theresulting energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, which travels 150million kilometers before bathing Earth with life-sustaining sunlight. Withoutit, we are not. With just the right amount, life thrives.The idea of somehow recreating this process here on Earth to generate nearlimitless amounts of safe, emission-free power remains a dream after more thanhalf a century. We understand the theory. We know it can work. We’vesuccessfully triggered nuclear fusion reactions on this planet. What we haven’tfigured out is a way to tightly control it. The nuclear fusion we can achievetoday is an instrument of death, not of life. It’s called a two-stagethermonuclear bomb, and its design is intentionally uncontrolled.1[e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-1] We got our first experience of its destruction in 1952during a U.S. nuclear test called Operation Ivy; an experimental bomb code-namedMike unleashed 10.4 megatons of explosive energy on a small island in the middleof the Pacific Ocean. That island, Elugelab, was entirely obliterated. The onlyevidence of its past existence is a two-kilometer-wide underwater crater. Scary.But what if we could tame the fusion beast for the good of the globe? What if wecould harness its power to create clean energy that is affordable, safe toproduce, and which doesn’t solve one problem by creating others, such as theproliferation of nuclear weapons or a legacy of highly radioactive waste thatremains dangerous for hundreds of years? And if we could, what would the effortlook like? A high-profile international project with hundreds of lab-coatwearing scientists from several countries collaborating under a single umbrella?Billions of dollars, of course, would be required for such a monumental globaleffort and, if all went well, fusion power would begin feeding the electricalgrid in about three, or more likely four, decades. If all this sounds familiar,it’s because it’s a general description of the controversial InternationalThermonuclear Experimental Reactor project, better known by the acronym ITER.ITER has been a going concern for more than 25 years. It began in 1985 as aresearch effort shared between the United States, Japan, the former SovietUnion, and what is now the European Union, but a detailed engineering designthat was acceptable to all parties didn’t emerge until 2001. It wasn’t until thefall of 2006 that members of ITER — now consisting of the EU, China, Japan,Russia, the United States, India, and South Korea — struck a formal agreement tomove forward with the 10-year construction of an experimental facility in thesouth of France that could demonstrate just the feasibility of fusion power. Theoriginal cost of construction was pegged at 5 billion Euros, or $6.4 billionU.S. By fall 2010, it had ballooned to more than 15 billion Euros, or nearly $20billion U.S.2 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-2] This enormous cost is what’s earned ITERthe label “controversial.” It has been hobbled by United Nations–stylebureaucracy and, without anything yet built, has seen its cost estimates triplein just four years. Some observers of the project, from both academia andindustry, rightly wonder whether this is a worthwhile international investmentor just a makeshift project for career nuclear scientists. Could $20 billion bebetter spent elsewhere? Can we afford to wait decades for the panacea of fusionpower as we stand on the precipice of climate catastrophe? “I think [fusionpower] will be solved,” British scientist and climate expert James Lovelock oncetold me. “I just don’t think it will be in time.”Michel Laberge shakes his head like a disapproving mother when he talks aboutITER. “ITER is a dinosaur,” he said. “It is so complex with all those countriesinvolved. It’s not moving at all.” Laberge is founder and president of GeneralFusion, a small company located in a nondescript industrial mall less than anhour outside of Vancouver, British Columbia. You might call General Fusion theanti-ITER. This gutsy little company, armed with three dozen or so engineers,aims to demonstrate by 2014 that it can create a “hot” nuclear fusion reactionthat gives off more energy — much more energy — than it takes to trigger it. Itplans to do this with $50 million, not $20 billion. And it expects to besupplying fusion-based power to the grid by 2020, not 2040 or later. Bold,ambitious, potentially disruptive, and, as you’ll find out, based on soundscience. But try knocking on the doors of investors to raise money for such anendeavor, or ask someone in the tightly knit community of government fusionscientists for a helping hand. “They tell us it’s totally impossible and thatwe’re completely crazy. That’s the consistent message,” Laberge said. “From thescientific world, the economic world, the government — all of them — they justdon’t take us seriously. Their argument is as follows: we have billions ofdollars, we have thousands of the brightest physicists working on this thing foryears and years, and you and your little bunch in the boonies with 50 milliondollars are going to make it? That’s totally impossible, you flakes. Go away. Wedon’t want to hear about it.”Dodgy Track RecordThey don’t want to hear about it because a number of high-profile fumbles haveleft a big embarrassing blotch on the history of fusion science. In 1958, aNobel prize–winning scientist from the United Kingdom named Sir John Cockcroftgathered the nation’s media to announce that he and his research team haddemonstrated controlled nuclear fusion in a giant machine nicknamed Zeta.Cockcroft beamed with pride. “To Britain,” he declared, “this discovery isgreater than the Russian Sputnik.”3 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-3] Commerciallygenerated fusion power was two decades away, he predicted. Just months laterCockcroft was forced to admit that his observation of nuclear fusion andsubsequent claims were an unfortunate mistake. Fast-forward 31 years to theinfamous “cold fusion” claims of chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann.Pons, chairman of the chemistry department at the University of Utah, andFleischmann, a veteran professor of electrochemistry at the U.K.’s University ofSouthampton, had collaborated for several years when, in 1983, their Utah labexperiments demonstrated a nuclear fusion reaction at room temperature. It was arelatively simple setup: a cathode, in this case a rod made of the preciousmetal palladium, was inserted into a glass tube filled with heavy water, whichis water with a high amount of a hydrogen isotope called deuterium. Whenelectricity was applied to the cathode, it caused bursts of heat that Pons andFleischmann believed to be a fusion reaction — the creation of new atoms causedby the fusing of deuterium in palladium. The output of energy, according to thetwo professors, was substantially higher than the energy going into the processin the form of electricity. They continued to refine their experiments until1989 when university administrators, bursting with excitement about thisground-breaking discovery, jumped the gun and scheduled a March 23 newsconference to announce this world-changing breakthrough.Standing behind a podium in a university auditorium packed with journalists — ascene captured on video that, thanks to the wonders of the Internet, is nowavailable on YouTube — Pons seemed quite confident about the discovery. “Theheat we can measure can only be accounted for by nuclear reactions,” he said.“The heat is so intense it cannot be explained by any chemical process that isknown.” He went on to paint a very positive portrait of the future. “I wouldthink it would be reasonable within a short number of years to build a fullyoperational device that could produce electric power or drive a steam turbine.”Fleischmann, acknowledging that much more research was needed to establish ascientific base for their findings, was equally optimistic about the“possibility of realizing sustained fusion with a relatively inexpensivedevice.” A global fusion frenzy immediately ensued, with laboratories around theworld attempting to replicate the Pons and Fleischmann setup. The state of Utaheven coughed up $4.5 million to establish a National Cold Fusion Institute inSalt Lake City.4 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-4]But something didn’t smell right, and by the end of 1989 it had become clearthat the claims were nonsense. All attempts at replication had failed or hadbeen proven faulty. In November 1989, an advisory panel created by the U.S.Department of Energy reported that the Pons and Fleischmann experiments andattempts to replicate them “do not present convincing evidence to associate thereported anomalous heat with a nuclear process.” Nuclear fusion at roomtemperature, the panel wrote, “would be contrary to all understanding gained ofnuclear reactions in the last half century; it would require the invention of anentirely new nuclear process.”5 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-5] The whole affair was anear death blow to the reputations of both men, who were accused of actingunethically. At best, their work was shoddy. They were lampooned. They ended upmoving (fleeing?) to France in 1992 to continue their work at a privately fundedlab. Pons never returned to the United States and ended up becoming a Frenchcitizen. Fleischmann left France in 1995 and returned to England where, for thenext decade, he dabbled in cold fusion research.As far as dabbling goes, there is actually a fair amount of cold fusionexperimentation going on in the scientific community, despite the fact that theU.S. patent office has stopped granting patents to cover such work.6[e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-6] One champion of cold fusion is Peter Hagelstein, anassociate professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology. He continues to carry the cold-fusion baton as part of a shrinkinggroup of dedicated researchers who are treated like pariahs by mainstreamacademics and scientists. One of the most recent demonstrations of cold fusionwas conducted by Yoshiaki Arata, a professor of physics at Osaka University inJapan, in spring 2008.7 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-7] It had blogs buzzing but themainstream media stayed far away.The media, with the exception of the Italian press, has also steered clear ofscientist Andrea Rossi and his partner Sergio Focardi, a physicist and professoremeritus at the University of Bologna. In January 2011, the two men demonstratedtheir own cold fusion apparatus, which they claim fuses nuclei of nickel andhydrogen to produce copper and huge amounts of excess energy. Rossi isapparently building a one-megawatt plant at his own expense for a company inGreece. A demonstration of that plant is expected in late 2011.8[e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-8] But beyond fringe observers, will the rest of the worldbe watching?The perception that low-cost fusion is a fool’s game — a perception GeneralFusion must contend with every day — was further strengthened by a scandalrelated to another tabletop process, this one called “bubble fusion.” RusiTaleyarkhan, a professor of nuclear engineering at Indiana’s Purdue Universityand former scientist at the U.S. government’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory,published a paper in 2002 describing how he had aimed high-frequency sound wavesat a glass flask filled with a deuterium-rich liquid. Pressure created fromthese ultrasonic waves, which can’t be detected by the human ear, caused tinybubbles in the liquid to violently collapse and release a tremendous amount ofheat. Researchers of bubble fusion refer to the setup as “star in a jar.”9[e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-9] Following this initial experiment, there were severalresearch groups seriously exploring bubble fusion, but by 2006, and afterburning through millions of dollars in funding, none of them were able toreplicate Taleyarkhan’s demonstration. It was around that time when Nature, thehighly respected scientific journal, published an investigation of Taleyarkhan’swork and concluded that “the circumstances surrounding the experiments revealserious questions about their validity.”10 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-10] Thejournal’s investigation created such a stir that Purdue University launched itsown probe and, in 2008, ended up finding Taleyarkhan guilty on two counts ofalleged research misconduct; his research chair was subsequently taken away.11[e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-11] So what was his misconduct? Taleyarkhan led people tobelieve that the bubble fusion effect he observed had been independentlyverified when, in fact, the “verification” had been conducted in Taleyarkhan’sown lab. The U.S. Office of Naval Research, which funded part of Taleyarkhan’swork, called the professor’s actions “research fraud” and barred him fromreceiving any sort of federal funding until 2012.12 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-12]To be clear, there is serious and important work going on in the areas of coldfusion and bubble fusion. Unfortunately, the blunders and bad apples ofyesteryear have pushed what was already considered fringe science into an evenmore defensive posture, and researchers in the field are akin to lepers at abeauty pageant.13 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-13] General Fusion is thrown into thesame category despite the fact that its approach doesn’t involve tabletopsetups, flasks, or collapsing bubbles. The foundation of its reactor technologywas first developed in the mid-1970s by the U.S. Naval Weapons Research Lab andis well supported by known scientific theory. But because General Fusion is asmall operation, because it’s not an international effort backed by billions ingovernment dollars, and because memories of Pons and Fleischmann and Taleyarkhanremain so vivid in the minds of so many, it has been branded another fusionfly-by-night that’s not worthy of attention or investment. “Nobody takes usseriously,” said Laberge.Old Boys’ ClubShould General Fusion be taken seriously? Let’s take a moment to examine whatthe company is trying to do, and how that differs from the two generallyaccepted approaches to nuclear fusion today: ITER’s magnetic fusion approach andthe inertial confinement fusion work being done at the U.S. government’sNational Ignition Facility in California. At the heart of ITER’s project is animposing machine called a tokamak, which, when completed, will weigh in at23,000 tonnes — half the weight of the Titanic and roughly equivalent to 67fully loaded Boeing 747 jumbo jets. A tokamak is essentially just anelectromagnet shaped on the inside like a hollowed-out doughnut. It’s made of 48magnet systems that, together, will create a magnetic field that’s 200,000 timesgreater than what the Earth produces. The idea is to inject a gas-like plasma ofdeuterium and tritium into the cavity of the electromagnetic doughnut. Intensemagnetic fields emanating from the walls of the cavity will keep theelectrically charged plasma under control and at enough distance from the wallsto prevent damage to equipment.14 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-14] The plasma will havenowhere to go, but because it will be energized it will race around inside thecavity of the doughnut like a dog chasing its tail. Before fusion can occur,however, the plasma must be heated up substantially — and by substantially Imean 10 times hotter than the core of our sun. This will be done by subjectingthe plasma to a barrage of radio waves, electromagnetic radiation, and “neutral”beams.15 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-15] “The plasma will catch fire when it gets hotenough. It’s called ignition,” said Laberge, explaining the point at which thedeuterium and tritium nuclei in the plasma begin fusing to form helium nuclei.At that stage, the trick is to simultaneously continue magnetically containingthe plasma, harvest the heat for power generation, and keep the reactionsustained.If it works as envisioned, the scientists at ITER hope that the 50 megawatts ofpower being used to drive and control the reactions will results in 500megawatts of power coming out — a 10-fold gain in energy. It’s an ambitioustarget, considering we’ve yet to even reach a break-even point in fusionresearch. The best effort to date has been at the ITER predecessor JET, theJoint European Torus facility, which in 1997 achieved an output of 16 megawattsfrom an input of 24 megawatts. There are a number of other small tokamakexperiments being conducted around the world. In May 2010, for example, Russiaand Italy agreed to push forward on their own project, Ignitor; China is alsoworking on its own machine. But ITER, with its size and $20-billion price tag,is the top dog. Laberge described it as scientific overkill that is being boggeddown by international politics and bickering over the bill: “We have a joke herethat China will produce a tokamak the size and power of ITER before ITER willhave the toilet installed in its building.”The second main approach being studied in fusion physics is called inertialconfinement, with most of the work being conducted at the U.S. government’sLawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). One of nine national labs spreadthroughout the country, LLNL houses the largest laser facility in the world, theNational Ignition Facility (NIF), which came to life in March 2009. It’s acontroversial operation, mainly because its mandate is to assist in thestewardship of nuclear weapons through controlled testing that can offer insightinto the physics behind thermonuclear explosions. The ITER-like hunt forcommercial fusion power, critics say, is a secondary pursuit that is used to puta peaceful spin on weapons research. No wonder its $3.5-billion price tag andongoing costs are covered under the U.S. government’s nuclear weapons budget.Still, the facility’s laser system is an impressive feat of engineering,consisting of 192 powerful laser beams carefully positioned within a buildingthe size of a football stadium. The whole operation is an orchestra oftechnology that demands perfect execution.To achieve ignition, the plan is to aim the laser beams at a spherical fuelpellet about one centimeter in diameter. The pellet has a glass shell and insideit a densely packed mixture of deuterium and tritium. When the lasers strike,they do so in one billionth of a second, creating an instant burst thatcompresses the pellet and produces the heat and pressure that triggers a fusionreaction. Voilà! You’ve got ignition. As with ITER, scientists hope they canshow an output of energy at least 10 times more than the energy required topower the lasers, though hundreds-fold gains are likely necessary to demonstratethat commercial fusion power production using this expensive method iseconomically viable.LLNL does a good job of explaining why 192 ultraviolet lasers are needed withthe analogy of a water balloon being squashed between two hands. “No matter howhard you try to spread your fingers evenly over the surface of the balloon, itwill squirt out between your fingers. Many more fingers would be needed tocompress the balloon symmetrically,” it explains on its website. “NIF’sdesigners arrived at 192 focused spots as the optimal number to achieve theconditions that will ignite a target’s hydrogen fuel and start fusion burn.”Those lasers must be positioned and triggered with near-absolute precision.First, they must hit the target at the same time. If one is more than 30picoseconds, or 30 trillionths of a second, out of synch the entire experimentfails. They must also strike their targets within 50 micrometers, or half thewidth of a human hair. The fuel pellet itself is slightly larger than a pearl ona necklace. The laser system’s pointing accuracy, according to LLNL, “can becompared to standing on the pitcher’s mound at AT&T Park in San Francisco andthrowing a strike at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, some 350 miles away.” Andthe system packs a powerful punch. For the few billionths of a second it ispulsed, its peak power is about 500 times the power used by the entire UnitedStates at any single point in time.16 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-16] It’s all veryinteresting, and tests conducted in 2010 are progressing well. Scientists at theNational Ignition Facility may indeed achieve ignition over the coming years,and in doing so bring a much-needed boost of confidence to the area of fusionresearch. Unfortunately, the approach may prove too expensive, inefficient, andcomplex to be practical for commercial fusion power generation.Hybrid VigorGeneral Fusion, unlike ITER or NIF, is pursuing an approach called magnetizedtarget fusion, which it considers a best-of-both hybrid of magnetic fusion andinertial confinement fusion. ITER’s approach, for example, confines the plasmabut uses externally supplied heat instead of compression to achievethermonuclear conditions; the National Ignition Facility uses a sudden burst oflasers to compress the plasma, but can’t confine it beyond a billionth of asecond. Magnetized target fusion, in theory, achieves a nice balance of bothcompression and confinement, and in doing so makes it possible for GeneralFusion to strip a lot of cost, complexity, and inefficiency out of thedemonstration reactor it’s hoping to build. No super-expensive lasers. Noenormous superconducting magnets that cost billions of dollars. Perhaps what’smost unbelievable is the company plans to demonstrate this ideal balance ofcompression and confinement on a budget that might just cover the cost ofbuilding and maintaining ITER’s washroom facilities over the next 20 years.39.jpg [images/39_fmt.jpeg]Here’s how it will work: imagine a big metal globe, a few meters across, that’sfilled with a mixture of liquid lithium and lead. The liquid is injected intothe globe in a way that causes the mixture to spin. This creates a vortex,similar to the whirlpool that forms when one rapidly stirs a glass of water witha spoon. The vortex in the globe stretches from top to bottom, creating apathway — an air gap — right through the middle of the mixture. Two separatelarge metal devices, called plasma injectors, are connected to the globe. Shapedlike the top of a sharpened pencil, one plasma injector is attached by itspointy end to the top and one to the bottom of the globe. There’s a good reasonfor the shape. The plasma injector’s job is to take tritium-deuterium gas, turnit into a doughnut-shaped plasma called a spheromak, and then push the plasmadoughnut through the increasingly narrow part of the injector, a process whichcompresses the plasma into a smaller and smaller doughnut until it reaches thetip of the injector. “It compresses the plasma, which heats it and makes it moredense as it goes through,” explained General Fusion chief executive DougRichardson. The process, which is happening in two injectors at the same time,relies on massive banks of capacitors and batteries to create the plasma and themagnetic fields that shape it, as well as on the electromagnetic forces requiredto push and compress the spheromak as it moves through the injector. When thespheromaks are at the tips of the injectors, the fusion fireworks are ready tobegin. One spheromak is launched into the top of the metal globe and one islaunched into the bottom. They travel toward each other through the air gap inthe spinning lithium-lead liquid until they meet each other at the center.[images/GF%20-%20pistons%20in%20motion_fmt.jpeg]On the exterior surface of the metal globe, there will be 200 to 300pneumatically controlled pistons jutting out. If you remember the characterPinhead from the 1987 Clive Barker horror movie Hellraiser, you have a veryrough idea of what this contraption will look like. When the two spheromaks meetin the middle of the metal globe, the pistons are simultaneously triggered. At avelocity of 100 meters a second, they ram the surface of the metal globe,creating sound waves that accelerate through the lead-lithium mixture andconverge toward the center. The sound waves gather so much speed that theybecome more powerful shock waves before impacting the plasma. When they doimpact, the spheromaks rapidly compress and heat up to conditions that trigger anuclear fusion reaction. Now comes the part where General Fusion makeselectricity out of all this. As we know from discussing ITER, the fusion ofdeuterium and tritium into helium releases a starburst of energy. In the GeneralFusion scenario, that energy is absorbed into the surrounding lithium-leadliquid. That liquid is pumped out of the globe, and the heat within it isextracted and used to make steam for power generation.Richardson told me a big risk in this process is that nobody has ever compresseda spheromak to the point where a fusion reaction is triggered. “There’s noreason why it won’t work,” he said. “But nobody has ever proven it.” Not onlydoes General Fusion have to prove it can be done, it has to eventually design acommercial machine that replicates the process every second — that is, everysecond two spheromaks must be shot with precision into the heart of the globeand compressed to the point of achieving fusion. That’s 60 shots every minute,or nearly 32 million successful fusion reactions every year. Throughout this,the superheated lithium-lead mixture must be constantly pumped out, extracted ofheat, and then pumped back in. “The way to think of this overall is as athermonuclear diesel engine,” Richardson explained. “You inject fuel. Then yousquish it, which is exactly what a diesel engine does. And if it gets hotenough, it burns.”So unlike ITER, a project designed to confine and sustain a single nuclearfusion reaction for years — even decades — General Fusion’s approach is tocreate smaller and easier-to-control fusion pulses every second. And unlike theNational Ignition Facility, which uses laser pulses, General Fusion’s approachis mechanical. “They’re literally using a sledgehammer,” said Rick Whittaker,vice president of investments at granting agency Sustainable DevelopmentTechnology Canada, which has stuck out its head to become the company’s biggestsingle funder.17 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-17] General Fusion believes it can builda commercial fusion power plant that delivers 40 units of energy for everysingle unit that goes into it, four times higher than what ITER is aiming toachieve. A fraction of the energy coming out would be harvested to trigger thenext reaction, keeping the process self-sustaining. “What we want to have at theend are economic power plants, not just a device that proves net gain forfusion,” said Richardson. Those plants would likely be rated about 300megawatts, or the equivalent of a small coal-fired power plant, and the fusionreactor itself would be about the size of a large barge. The company claims itsfusion plants would eventually be capable of producing electricity for less than5 cents per kilowatt-hour, making it one of the cheapest and cleanest forms ofpower generation on the planet.If magnetized target fusion is such a good idea, then why aren’t the top fusionscientists in the world working on it? Why aren’t investors knocking downGeneral Fusion’s door? Why are Laberge and his team written off as crackpots?A Brilliant MindHoping to answer such questions, I traveled to Vancouver in the summer of 2010to get a closer look at General Fusion and a better appreciation of itsstruggle. When I first sat down with Michel Georges Laberge and told him I wasdedicating a chapter of this book to his work on nuclear fusion, the Quebec-bornengineer, wearing a blue T-shirt, green khakis, and purple-tinted sunglasses,asked me what I planned to call the book.“Mad Like Tesla,” I said, explaining that inventors and entrepreneurs doingdisruptive work in the energy field, like himself, have much in common withinventor Nikola Tesla, despite their century of separation.“Oh shit,” replied Laberge in a French accent that remains thick even after 25years outside his home province. “Tesla finished his life in debt anddestitution. Is this my future?”[images/43_fmt.jpeg]Doug Richardson (left) and Michel Laberge pose in front of their prototypeplasma injector, surrounded by capacitor banks.I read a clever description of Laberge in a Popular Science article aboutGeneral Fusion that appeared in early 2009. “On the mad-scientist appearancescale, Laberge is maybe a 4 out of 10; he’s a little rumpled and wearsout-of-style wire-rimmed eyeglasses,” wrote journalist Josh Dean. “But get him alittle agitated and he starts to tug at his hair and slips to maybe a 5 or 6.”18[e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-18] As long as Laberge doesn’t start seeking the love of awhite pigeon, I thought to myself, he’ll be okay.Laberge would have been far better off financially had he stayed on the path hewas on. During the 1990s he was a senior physicist and principal engineer atVancouver-based Creo Products, a developer of digital laser technologies for theprinting industry that ended up being purchased by Eastman Kodak in 2005. Hisskills were appreciated, his job was stable, and the money was quite good.Laberge’s expertise was in making sure the laser beams on commercial printerswere properly aligned; if they’re not, strange stripes called microbands appearon the printed stock. Not the most exciting job, but it paid the bills.In 2000 Laberge’s role at Creo took an unexpected turn. Amos Michelson, thecompany’s chief executive at the time, was in awe at how much money was changinghands during a telecommunications boom that had companies such as NortelNetworks and Cisco Systems on irrational multibillion-dollar shopping sprees.One deal saw Nortel Networks spend $3.4 billion in stock for a tiny SiliconValley company called Xros, which had zero revenue and only a few dozenemployees. Xros had developed a “micro-mirror router,” a type of optical switchthat used thousands of tiny mirrors to reflect light pulses sent throughfiber-optic communications lines. It allowed the big phone and Internetcompanies to dramatically boost the capacity of their networks. “My CEO says,‘Wow, $4 billion [Canadian] for 30 guys in a garage, what a fantasticevaluation! Let’s do an optical switch of our own and throw our share pricethrough the roof,’” recalled Laberge. “So I thought, okay, I think I can dothis.”It was an odd project for a printing company, but Laberge was assigned to lead acrack team of five engineers who reported to a project manager named DougRichardson (who was later recruited to be General Fusion’s CEO), and within sixmonths and for less than $1 million they produced an optical switch thatoutperformed anything else on the market. “This inflated my ego a little bit,”said Laberge, who took great satisfaction in knowing that for dramatically lessmoney and time he was able to beat engineering teams at Nortel, Cisco, and AT&T.Unfortunately, just as Creo was preparing to introduce its superior opticalswitch to the marketplace and stir up a bidding war for its technology, thetelecommunications market collapsed. Investment plunged. Orders evaporated.Companies such as Nortel Networks eventually became worthless penny stocks.“Nobody was interested in telecom whatsoever, so my big project went into thegarbage. It was terminated,” said Laberge, scratching a red beard that’ssprouting much more grey these days. “They ended up putting me back into laserprinters.”Having tasted something different, something more exciting through thefast-paced telecom project, Laberge was reluctant to reclaim his job as themicroband killer. “I was bored of this, and faced with going back I said to hellwith it. I was turning 40 and had a bit of a mid-life crisis. Most guys get aPorsche, but I decided to throw my job away and form a nuclear fusion company.”He took the summer off and spent time on the deck of his house on heavilyforested Bowen Island, a nature lovers’ paradise just a couple of kilometerswest of the B.C. mainland. It was there, with mountains in the background, oceanin all directions, and an Internet-connected laptop at his side, that henarrowed down the approach to nuclear fusion that would result in the birth ofGeneral Fusion. The company’s first “headquarters” was an old, ramshackle gasstation garage near his home.It’s not often that within a period of two years a person moves from laserprinters to telecom switches to nuclear fusion, but Laberge is among a selectgroup of individuals with the qualifications to do it. During the early 1980s hestudied physics at Quebec’s Laval University, but left his home province in 1985to pursue a Ph.D. in fusion physics at the University of British Columbia. Heearned that degree in 1990 and, just before joining Creo, continuedpost-doctorate work at the École Polytechnique in Palaiseau, near Paris, and atCanada’s National Research Council in Ottawa. His work at Creo was a completedeparture from what he’d been studying, but it also made him an expert in thedigital signal processing (DSP) and servo-control technologies that were centralto the development of high-speed laser printers, and which would prove a crucialelement of General Fusion’s reactor technology. “Michel Laberge is one of thefew kinds in the world who understood the engineering behind digital signalprocessing and plasma physics,” said one of General Fusion’s earliest investors,venture capitalist Michael Brown, during one of our many chats together. “Hardlyanybody has that combination.”It’s a vital combination, one that explains why Laberge could approach fusionwith an open mind and from a fresh perspective. Most fusion scientists havespent their entire careers pointed in the same direction and are not prepared toshift course. They have tunnel vision, and this, as far as Laberge is concerned,has created an environment of science-by-committee where advances in fusion havebeen incremental, at best. “All the funds and grants are distributed bycommittees that are full of physicists who work on the subjects being funded,”Laberge told me. ITER has been a going concern for nearly three decades. Oncethe decision was made to head in the direction of magnetic fusion, the projectbecame a slow-moving train that over time has gathered huge momentum. About1,000 people will be employed directly by ITER during its operational phase.Fusion research is a small niche within the larger nuclear research field, yetITER allows hundreds of these specialized researchers to build careers out ofthis single project. The same can be said of the National Ignition Facility.Abraham Loeb, director of the Institute for Theory and Computation at HarvardUniversity, writes that this form of groupthink is becoming more prevalent inbasic scientific research. Scientists, he believes, are “increasingly pursuingprojects in large groups with rigid research agendas and tight schedules thatpromote predictable goals.”19 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-19] Unlike most fusionscientists, Laberge didn’t carry any such baggage. He wasn’t on the ITER train.That rare perspective allowed him to rediscover magnetized target fusion, whichthe U.S. Naval Weapons Research Lab had worked on back in the 1970s. They cameup with a design, called LINUS, which is the underlying basis of GeneralFusion’s reactor design. LINUS was shelved, not because it couldn’t work, butbecause the technology didn’t exist at the time to build one that could work.Recall that this is a mechanical process, relying on hundreds of huge pistonsstriking a metal ball at the exact same time in a microsecond. The technologydidn’t exist in the 1970s to control the timing of those piston strikes with thekind of precision and speed that could achieve a fusion reaction. Like manyinventions, it was abandoned because pieces of the puzzle weren’t just missing,they didn’t exist at all. The problem is that when those pieces came intoexistence, they remained missing, because anyone who once cared had moved on, oreven passed away. Nobody was looking to breathe new life into magnetized targetfusion, until Laberge came along in 2001. In the case of LINUS, the missingpieces were digital signal processing (i.e., superfast computers) andhigh-precision servo-control systems, the same technologies that Laberge built acareer on while at Creo. Laberge realized that by employing technology he knewintimately, LINUS now had a good chance at success. History is littered withinventions that were rediscovered later when advances in material science,digital processing, and other technologies made them possible; Leonardo daVinci’s helicopter is just one popular example. Patent offices are a treasuretrove of unrealized potential if one stops to scour their archives.Enter an AngelBut let’s get back to venture capitalist Michael Brown and his impressions ofLaberge. In many ways Brown is the father of Canadian venture capital,particularly when it comes to energy technologies. He’s been at it since 1968,when he co-founded Vancouver-based Ventures West Capital. In 1987 he was thefirst venture capitalist to make a bet on Ballard Power Systems, which was thebrightest light in the hydrogen fuel-cell market until dreams of a hydrogeneconomy began fading in the late 1990s. Over the years his money and influencehave helped dozens of companies, many of them based in British Columbia,including Canadian aerospace firm MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates andwireless pioneer Mobile Data International, which was purchased by telecom giantMotorola in 1988. Brown left Ventures West in 1999 and two years laterco-founded Chrysalix Energy, a firm that manages more than $300 million inventure investments. Now in his early 70s and perhaps a more contemplative soulas a result, Brown has become somewhat of a philosopher of venture investing.It was around 2002 when Brown first became aware of Laberge and his seeminglyinsane mission to build a fusion reactor. He heard of the fusion work through anengineering superstar by the name of Dan Gelbart, who in an earlier career atMacDonald Dettwiler and as a founder of Mobile Data had become friends withBrown. Gelbart was also co-founder of Creo and knew Laberge quite well. “Gelbartthinks Michel Laberge is one of the smartest engineers he’s ever worked with,”said Brown. “He spoke highly of Michel, so I decided to throw in $10,000. Then Ijust sort of stood on the sidelines for a while. I mentally wrote off myinvestment.” It was Brown’s personal money; it didn’t come from Chrysalix.Laberge also had strong support from friends and family during these early days.He managed to raise about $400,000 from a group of about 40 people, most of themformer Creo colleagues. Richardson was one of them, long before he becameGeneral Fusion’s CEO in 2006.Laberge’s local support network expanded as he reached out to the B.C.technology community. He convinced Gelbart to join General Fusion’s board, aswell as Denis Connor, who as former head of the Science Council of BritishColumbia was heavily involved in a number of clean technology ventures. Venturecapitalist Jim Fletcher, one of Brown’s partners at Chrysalix (and a formerpartner at Ventures West), also joined the board after investing some of hispersonal money in the company. Connor and Gelbart are named on one of GeneralFusion’s first patents along with Laberge and Simon Fraser University chemistryprofessor Ross Hill — the result of a private brainstorming session that Labergehad organized with, in his words, “lots of local high-tech dudes.” Connor,Gelbart, and Hill contributed ideas that ended up making their way into GeneralFusion’s initial reactor design.For a few years Laberge worked away on the concept as a one-man show. It wasspring 2007 when Connor, still on the board, bumped into Brown and mentionedthat Laberge, who by then had Richardson on as CEO, was making solid progressand coming up with interesting results. Brown was intrigued and became moreengaged. After doing extensive due diligence of his own, he decided to takeGeneral Fusion under his wing. He knew that if the company was to get anywhere,it needed to raise tens of millions of dollars to demonstrate proof-of-conceptand eventually build a device that could achieve net gain — i.e., a fusionreaction that releases more energy than it took to trigger it. Some initial seedmoney did flow, through investments from Chrysalix, the Business DevelopmentBank of Canada, and another Vancouver-based venture firm called GrowthWorks.20[e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-20] “We used to meet in the coffee shop in the Holiday Innright by the Second Narrows Bridge,” a railway bridge that connects Vancouver toNorth Vancouver, recalled Brown. “We took trips to the venture-capital communityand had lots of highs and lows, mostly lows.”Brown spent a lot of time helping the company look more appetizing forinvestors. He prepared many of their financial presentations, put their budgetsinto a recognizable format, wrote up a marketing plan, and even drafted aprospective hiring plan for senior management. He also realized the companyneeded some strong endorsements from engineers and scientists who knew what theywere talking about. Brown made use of some contacts he had at aerospace giantBoeing, which was once a limited partner in Chrysalix, and managed to get a teamof five Boeing engineers to write up a 14-page technical review that assessedthe mechanical control and manufacturing issues of General Fusion’s reactordesign. Brown was encouraged by their final report: “They basically concludedthere’s no reason why it isn’t going to work.” Another analysis was done byleading fusion expert Ken Fowler, professor emeritus of nuclear engineering andplasma physics at the University of California, Berkeley. Fowler has closeconnections with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and is one of therare fusion scientists with an expertise in spheromak plasma confinement. When Ispoke with Fowler in 2009, he was cautious, but still held high hopes forGeneral Fusion and said there were no technical showstoppers to its approach.“I’m rooting for them,” he said.Armed with these positive reports from two credible sources, and given thegame-changing implications of the technology, you would think a seasoned venturecapitalist such as Brown would have an easy time tapping into his network andbringing more investors on board. That’s not how the story unfolded. “Theylooked us in the eye and said it can’t possibly work. So we said, alright, comemeet the guys and talk to the scientists. But they just wouldn’t do it; theywon’t talk to the scientists,” said Brown, expressing frustration during onephone call we had in late 2009. “What do we have to prove for people to take itout of the category of junk?” Laberge told me the investment community, by andlarge, just isn’t prepared to understand complex technologies. General Fusionhad a detailed 400-page report that anyone could read, but few were willing totake the plunge. “In order to understand this, you need at least a degree inphysics, and then at least two to three weeks of reading and researching onwebsites,” said Laberge. “Who is going to take this sort of time out of theirjob to understand something new? Who is going to throw [away] two weeks of theirtime to try to understand an offer? Is it easier to say no, go away, you’re aflake, or to take two weeks and look into it? It’s easier to say go away. Sothat’s the biggest problem we have.” Brown said it’s partly about Silicon Valleygroupthink. “In Silicon Valley, unless the high-profile guys have anointedsomething, it’s like everyone else is afraid to go to a cocktail party and tellsomeone about a technology like this,” he said. “What groupthink gets them to dois to fund 174 solar thin-film companies.”A big boost came in March 2009 when a Canadian agency called SustainableDevelopment Technology Canada (SDTC) announced that it would grant GeneralFusion $13.9 million Canadian. The agency was created by the federal governmentto help fund emerging clean technology ventures, but its commitment to GeneralFusion was a huge gamble for an organization where the average deal size iscloser to $3 million and whose funding comes from a government with no formalfusion research program. Canada, it should be noted, has a stubborn obsessionwith its homegrown brand of nuclear fission reactor technology: the CanadaDeuterium Uranium reactor, known as CANDU. Rick Whittaker, SDTC’s vice presidentof investments, said the agency’s support for General Fusion was far fromguaranteed: “Because of all the skepticism, we dug deep and we brought inexperts.” The SDTC funding ended up diluting investment risk, making it easierfor private investors to loosen up their wallets. It was still like pullingteeth, but by August 2009 General Fusion was able to raise $13.75 million morefrom GrowthWorks and Chrysalix, as well as newcomers Braemar Energy Ventures andthe Entrepreneurs Fund. It was enough money to design and demonstrate crucialcomponents, such as the pistons and plasma injectors. But about $25 million morewill be needed to build the metal sphere that lies at the heart of the reactor.Those pieces will go together to demonstrate net-gain fusion by 2014. “Afterthat, we’ll need multiple billions of dollars to make it into a power plant,”said Richardson. “But if we can show that net-gain, the money should beavailable to go to that next level.”Laberge gives Mike Brown full credit for getting them this far. “Without Mike wedon’t exist. He introduced us to all the right people.” Perseverance is payingoff. Investors willing to take the time to study Laberge’s approach are slowlycoming onside. General Fusion announced in May 2011 it had raised another $19.5million, with a portion of that — to the surprise of many — coming from JeffBezos, the multibillionaire founder of Amazon.com.21 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-21]Canadian oil company Cenovus Energy also contributed, bringing total funding inGeneral Fusion to about $46 million. Sometimes crazy sells, particularly whenthe risks are far outweighed by the potential rewards.Plasma Go BoomIt was a perfectly sunny July day in Vancouver when I visited General Fusion’soffice to get a close look inside. The first thing that grabbed me was the colorof the office walls, a disgusting shade of green that told me the place employsa bunch of engineers who couldn’t care less about aesthetics. Richardson greetedme at the front reception wearing faded blue jeans and a grey T-shirt with asmiling orange sun on the front and the words “A day without fusion is like aday without sunshine.” Richardson fits the classic Pacific Coast image, at leastfrom an easterner’s perspective. He’s in shape, laid back, and looks like hecould be a surfer — definitely an outdoorsy type who likes to take his canoe andgo portaging. He took me for a tour of the warehouse in the back where all thetinkering happens. The main attraction was the plasma injector, which lookedlike something out of the Matrix. Wires sprouted from it and cords cluttered thewarehouse floor. Surrounding it were banks of batteries and capacitors, thelatter controlled by Russian-designed switches, which create and drive thespheromaks that are injected into the reactor. Shortly after the first round offunding closed in August 2009, company engineers began building the injector. Ittook nine months to assemble. “If this injector were to be built in a governmentlab, it would take four years,” Richardson said proudly.A couple of minutes later our ears were pierced by a loud siren, like somethingyou hear on Star Trek whenever a Klingon Bird-of-Prey is about to attack theU.S.S. Enterprise. Richardson shouted to a bunch of engineers standing nearby.“Is there a reason we shouldn’t be on the floor?” he asked. Without a firmanswer, he grabbed me a helmet and some headphones and told me to put them on —just in case. “If it discharges the wrong way, the thing can come apart,” hesaid with voice raised. “A capacitor could fall apart. If you put that muchenergy into a single piece and it blew, it could send a little bit of shrapnelflying.” The siren went silent moments later and the engineers, clearlyperplexed, began to troubleshoot. The issue, Richardson explained as we stoodbehind a military-grade blast wall, had to do with a funny sound heard duringthe discharge of power to the injector. “If things sound unusual in the circuit,there could be something that’s gone amiss. Life has taught us if you hear suchthings it’s better to find out what it is than ignore it.” It’s a wise approach,when one considers that the capacitor banks when fully powered will carry a10-microsecond jolt that, if misdirected, could cause equipment to vaporize. Onthis day, it’s using about 40 percent of full power, rising every week.Richardson walked me to another part of the industrial complex that is used forstorage. We saw one of the original pistons designed by Laberge, as well as a“Version 2” to be used in more advanced testing. Beside it was a station wherethe lead-lithium is heated and kept in liquid metal form. “Before we make thesphere, we have to understand how to handle the liquid metal,” he explained. “Dowe have all the right seals? Do our seals leak? How many shots can they take?Can they operate at a temperature gradient?” Computer simulations don’t cut it,he said. “Investors want it proved. The goal is to de-risk all the majorcomponents [using] the least amount of money possible.”Have there been any hiccups, what I refer to as “Oh shit!” moments? “There arelittle ‘Oh shits!’ all the time,” Richardson said. He rattled some off:impurities that get into piping, temperatures that are too low and end upgumming up the liquid-metal pumping system, a strange sound that can’t betraced. He went further, laying out some of the technical challenges that lieahead. For example, they have to show they can compress the plasma in a way thatdoesn’t compromise its symmetry. Remember the earlier balloon analogy? GeneralFusion has to prove that its plasma balloon, in the shape of a doughnut, can becompressed to fusion conditions without losing its form — without some part ofthe plasma bulging out and destroying its original shape.They also don’t really know what happens to the plasma at peak compression. Toget some insight, they went cheap and low-tech by turning to high explosives.They trucked a metal-reinforced shipping container into a licensed test field. Asmall plasma injector inside the container shot plasma into a metal can on theroof. About one kilogram of explosives around the can was detonated, causing theplasma to compress. From that experiment, Laberge and his team were able tocollect valuable data. At the time of writing, the company was preparing to use50 kilograms of explosives for another experiment that would demonstratenet-gain. Why play with explosives in a field? “The big metal sphere in ourreactor is going to cost us a lot of money,” explained Laberge, who met up withus later in the tour. “But what if the physics don’t work? We need todemonstrate the physics beforehand, that way we take financial risk out ofbuilding the sphere.” Such crude experiments were talked about in the 1970s butnever carried out. “I don’t know exactly why, but there is evidence in theliterature that people planned to do it. They just never did,” he said.Good Skills HuntingAnother major challenge has less to do with technology and engineering andeverything to do with human resources. Laberge has managed to recruit manyformer engineering colleagues from Creo, but finding people with a background inplasma and fusion physics — whether seasoned scientists or younger newcomers —has been a frustrating experience for him. “We made job offers to all the guysin the business who are big in the government labs, have lots of experience, andhave a little gray in the hair. They all turned us down. Nobody will risk hiscareer in a nice Los Alamos lab to go to a small startup in Canada,” saidLaberge, adding that recruiting recent post-doctorates in the subject has alsobeen difficult. “They are reluctant to come because it might make a dent intheir otherwise awesome résumé. There’s this stigma in going to work at aprivate company in fusion. Very few scientists in this field are willing to gofor it.” Peter Hagelstein, the MIT professor who continues to push forward oncold fusion research, has drawn attention to this sad state of affairs: the poolof talent willing to carry on with unconventional, outside-the-box fusionresearch is evaporating. “There are fewer and fewer people each year, the amountof resources is not great, and basically we’re getting older — we’re not goingto live forever,” he said. “There’s a very good chance we’re not going to finishour work before there’s none of us left. Generally, new people have not beenjoining the field . . . If a young person thinks of joining the field, he or shedoes it at peril of having a career ruined by association.”22[e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-22]It’s not just conventional fusion scientists thumbing their noses. Even moredismissive is the contingent of scientists and engineers who have devoted theircareers to technologies that instead of fusing atoms split them apart. Callednuclear fission, this speciality offers what fusion science doesn’t: anindustry. There are roughly 440 fission-based nuclear power plants around theworld.23 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1a-23] Collectively they produce about 14 percent ofthe planet’s electricity, and nuclear lobby groups are pushing hard forpoliticians to embrace a rapid-build nuclear program as part of efforts toreduce greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants. Fission scientists representthe establishment, and for them, fusion power plants are a pipe dream. But thelight-water nuclear reactors sold by Westinghouse Electric, General Electric,and France’s Areva, as well as Canada’s heavy-water CANDU reactors, are stillcomplicated and expensive beasts. The radioactive waste they create is deadlyand must be stored safely for hundreds of years. Reactor meltdowns, consideredrare, are always a lingering risk. The world was reminded of this disturbingfact on March 11, 2011, when a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunamipummelled Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, causing fuel rodmeltdowns in three of six reactors. Huge amounts of radiation leaked into theocean and surrounding air, contaminating fish, seaweed, crops, and other localsources of food. Authorities had no choice but to cull thousands of livestockwithin the area. More than 80,000 residents within 20 kilometres of the plant,and many beyond 30 kilometres, were forced to evacuate without knowing when, ifever, they could return. It may be years before the full impact of the disaster— on the Japanese economy, on affected communities, on thousands of human lives,and on the environment — is known.There’s also the problem of “dual use” — the fact that the plants and equipmentused to enrich uranium as fuel for power reactors can also be used to makehighly enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb. The fear is that the morefission-based nuclear power plants we build, the higher risk there is of weaponsproliferation. Fusion doesn’t carry this heavy risk. A fusion reactor can’t meltdown, doesn’t encourage proliferation, and creates none of the dangerous wastethat comes from a fission reactor. Fusion power, if it were to be provensuccessful, could spell the decline of fission power and the industry builtaround it.But fusion power has always been just around the corner, the forever-emergingtechnology that’s going to save the planet. It’s the energy breakthrough thatkeeps crying wolf, or “Eureka!,” and over time most people have simply tunedout. I asked Laberge what he considered his odds of success. “I put my chancesat 50 percent,” he said. “And by the way, I was at 30 percent last year, so it’sgetting better.” Success means different things to different people in differentsituations. For Laberge, success may be simply proving his doubters wrong bydemonstrating that the impossible is possible. Merely showing possibility,however, is a fraction of the fusion journey. Even if it works, the establishedenergy industry will still resist. Regulators, influenced by the old boys’ club,will take their time approving it. Utilities, never a group to take a chance ona technology without a track record, will drag their feet. For a General Fusionpower plant to have any impact during our lifetimes will require seriousbackstopping from the government.Laberge isn’t blind to these challenges. He hopes he will see a couple of300-megawatt beta plants in commercial operation by 2020. After that it may takedecades for meaningful adoption. But forecasting is a mug’s game. All he cancontrol is his own work — proving that cheap, safe electricity throughcommercial fusion can be done, sooner rather than later. “I believe if you comewith a solution that makes sense, the resources to build your product willcome.”It’s that kind of thinking that drives innovation, and that drove inventors likeNikola Tesla to forge on despite the many obstacles in their path. But in atleast one way Laberge has it easy. He doesn’t have to build his power plant36,000 kilometers above the surface of the Earth. That, as you’ll read in thenext chapter, is what aerospace veteran Gary Spirnak is attempting to do.Notes:1 [e01_TESLA-1.html#x1ax1] The first stage of a thermonuclear bomb relies onnuclear fission (the splitting of uranium or plutonium isotopes), which releasesenergy, creating the heat and compression needed to trigger the second stagefusion reaction of the hydrogen isotopes tritium and deuterium.

All Earth turned off its burning coal, its fissioninguranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, onemile in diameter, circling the Earth at half a distance from the moon. All Earthran by invisible beams of sunpower.”— Isaac Asimov, “The Last Question” (1956)Replicating a fusion process that takes place inside the sun is one way to bringunlimited amounts of clean energy to humanity. Doing a better job of harnessingwhat the sun already does is another.Two days after visiting General Fusion, I hopped on a plane to Los Angeles tovisit the Manhattan Beach headquarters of Solaren Corporation, a tiny startupwith supersized ambitions. The company captured headlines on April 13, 2009,when California’s biggest energy utility, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) of SanFrancisco, announced an unprecedented agreement to purchase all the electricityfrom a 200-megawatt solar power plant to be designed, assembled, and operated bySolaren. It wouldn’t be such big news except for one not-so-trivial fact:instead of being built on a sun-drenched desert, the power plant would be parkedin orbit about 36,000 kilometers above the Earth’s surface. The world’s firstspace-based power station would harvest energy from the sun, the ultimatenuclear fusion reactor, and use microwaves to beam that energy down to Earthwhere it would be converted into clean electricity. Solaren plans to build theentire system in California, pack it tightly enough to fit into four, maybefive, rockets, and then launch the pieces into space. Once in orbit the pieceswill automatically unfold, use special sensors to find each other, and then beremotely assembled by Solaren engineers sitting safely and comfortably in a LosAngeles control room. No astronauts; no danger pay required. Electricity,remarkably, is expected to start flowing to California homes and businesses by2016.Solaren’s breakthrough PG&E deal, which was approved months later byCalifornia’s public utilities commission, attracted a barrage of mediaattention. But it also drew equal amounts of criticism and questions. Who werethese space mavericks? How serious could they be? Was this just a money-makingscheme with no chance of success? How could a small private company possiblyfollow through? Outer space, after all, is the domain of big government.I have to admit, visiting Solaren’s office didn’t inspire much confidence. Nohigh-tech campus or fancy lobby with a wall-mounted plasma TV running a slickcorporate video. No small-scale models showing how a space-based solar powerstation would look. In fact, when I arrived I thought I had the wrong address.My taxi dropped me in front of a sprawling building on a well-manicured propertysurrounded by palm trees. The building was a 12-year-old movie studio calledRaleigh Manhattan Beach Studios, built by Walt Disney’s nephew Roy and home toMarvel Studios. That’s right, it turned out Solaren’s headquarters is also whereIron Man 2, Thor, and The Avengers were filmed, along with more than a dozenprime-time TV shows, including Boston Legal and CSI: Miami. After walking past aclothes trailer beside the set of 90210, I eventually found my way to Solaren’soffice, tucked away on the far end of the building.Cal Boerman, the company’s director of energy services, met me at an elevatorbank and took us to the second floor. Solaren had just moved in a few monthsearlier, he explained, as we walked through 18,000 square feet of bright andempty office space with that telltale new carpet smell. “It was like a cave whenwe first got it, everything was very dark and dank,” said Boerman, who told methat the previous tenant was the editing and prepping offices for The BiggestLoser. The office comfortably accommodated about 60 staff, plenty of room forthis eight-person operation to grow. But on the day of my visit, the walls werestill bare and individual offices appeared unused. A big “Solaren” sign hung inan otherwise empty reception area.[images/57_fmt.jpeg]Cal Boerman (left) and Gary Spirnak pose beside a new Solaren sign at thecompany's new — and at the time very sparse — office in Los Angeles.It was a funny juxtaposition: a small startup trying to make what many considerthe stuff of science fiction a reality, housed in the same building as a studiotrying to make these kinds of impossible-seeming ideas a reality on the bigscreen. It wasn’t until company co-founder and chief executive Gary Spirnakentered the conference room and began laying out Solaren’s strategy that I beganto think these guys were the real deal — and, well, just might pull it off.Sure, there are those who say it’s too risky an enterprise to ever work, or tooexpensive to justify in the foreseeable future. At least one top NASA officialhas dismissed the concept as “fiscally ridiculous.” Spirnak, who could pass foractor Kevin Spacey’s taller and cleaner-cut twin, isn’t shaken by such comments.In fact, he more than welcomes the skepticism: the fewer people who follow hispath the better. “We would like to be in a position where in two years, as weget this off and running, it will take a consortium of countries to catch us.That’s the kind of head start we want,” he said. “This is not something thatintimidates us. We know exactly what we’re doing, and we know how hard it is.”An Unfolding FantasySpirnak’s confidence in his bold mission is best put into perspective with a bitof a history lesson. The idea began in the realm of science fiction and the workof writer Isaac Asimov, who is credited as the first person to mention theconcept of space-based solar power in his 1941 short story “Reason,” as well asin later writings such as “The Last Question.” In “Reason” (part of Asimov’s I,Robot series), two engineers, Gregory Powell and Mike Donovan, work on a stationin space that beams energy to Earth and other nearby planets. “Our beams feedthese worlds energy drawn from one of those huge incandescent globes thathappens to be near us,” Powell explains to Cutie, a robot he has built. “We callthat globe the sun.”1 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-1]Nearly three decades would pass before reality caught up with fantasy. In 1968,45-year-old aerospace engineer Peter Glaser first presented the idea of aspace-based solar power station at an industry gathering in Boulder, Colorado.His speech was met with raised eyebrows and head-scratching. “Some of themembers of the audience thought I was discussing science fiction,” recalledGlaser in his unpublished memoirs, parts of which his wife, Eva, kindly sharedwith me.2 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-2] That same year Glaser published a paper in theresearch journal Science that detailed how one might go about building a systemin orbit that collects energy from the sun and beams it to a massive receivingstation on Earth. In 1973 Glaser became the first person to obtain a U.S. patenton this design concept.The Czech-American engineer was far from an unknown name in aerospace circles;he was, in fact, deeply involved in the U.S. space program. In the late 1960sGlaser led a team of engineers who designed a special laser-reflecting systemthat was deployed on the moon as part of the historic Apollo 11 lunar landingmission. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin installed the device, which is a special type ofmirror that can reflect an incoming laser beam back to the location from whichit came. It’s the only experiment on the lunar surface that’s still operationaltoday, and it allows scientists to measure the distance between the Earth andthe moon, which we now know is expanding by about an inch every year because ofthe sun’s gravitational pull.Glaser’s interest in space-based solar power seems to have evolved out of hisearly days as an engineer at management consulting firm Arthur D. Little. One ofGlaser’s first major assignments was to develop a way to expose certainmaterials to extremely high temperatures, mimicking what a spacecraft wouldexperience upon reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere. He designed a solar furnacefor his experiments but became frustrated every time a cloud blocked out thesun. That may have planted in his mind, early on, the idea that tapping thesun’s energy was most valuable when done beyond the clutter of Earth’satmosphere.It would be unfair to imply that Glaser’s idea of a space-based solar powerplant was filed away under a folder labeled “Wacky Concepts.” Scientists andengineers outside the field may have been skeptical in the late ’60s, but theidea intrigued both the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration (NASA) and over the past three decades about $80million has been spent studying the concept.3 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-3] Throughoutmuch of the 1970s both agencies conducted thorough design and feasibilitystudies. In 1981 the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment brought all of thesestudies together in one 300-page report that warned against rolling the dice onwhat it termed solar power satellites (SPS). “Too little is currently knownabout the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of SPS to make a sounddecision whether to proceed with its development and deployment,” the reportconcluded. “Even if it were needed and work began now, a commercial SPS isunlikely to be available before 2005–2015 because of many uncertainties and thelong lead time needed for testing and demonstrations.”4 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-4]A number of potential barriers were cited. The public, it said, would worryabout environmental and health risks, mainly related to the idea of invisiblebeams of energy striking the Earth. Wouldn’t these microwaves cook birds andanimals that got caught in their path? High cost was another major obstacle, aswell as military concerns. How, after all, could we protect a solar power plantin space from being shot down by the Russians or some other rogue nation? Theenvironmental lobby was also flagged as a potential roadblock because effortsdirected at space-based solar power could drain resources away from small-scaleterrestrial solar technologies. The latter put power into the hands ofindividuals and communities, which was considered a good thing. By contrast,space-based solar power — like nuclear power — further concentrateddecision-making and control in the hands of large government agencies andutilities. Not such a good thing.The 1981 report, which came out during President Ronald Reagan’s first year inthe White House, promptly faded into the background, and serious talk ofspace-based solar power didn’t resurface until the mid-1990s. Reagan slashed therenewable energy programs created under previous president Jimmy Carter; Reaganwas more interested in funding the Strategic Defense Initiative, which came tobe known as “Star Wars,” a space-based missile system that could defend theUnited States from a foreign attack.A Fresh LookNASA revived its interest in space-based solar power early in the Clinton years.In 1995 the agency launched its “Fresh Look Study” to find out if the concept,measured against the latest technologies and projected advances in solar cells,robotics, and launch capabilities, was ready for a big government push. Thestudy concluded that, indeed, the concept was more viable and that more detailedresearch was needed, sparking a series of research efforts throughout the late1990s. Consultations with outside technologists and an independent economic andmarket analysis culminated in the creation of the Solar Power ExploratoryResearch and Technology (SERT) program.SERT was enthusiastic about space-based solar power but its findings didn’tsugar-coat the challenges that still remained. What it did do was set aggressivebut, in its view, achievable timelines for development. SERT concluded that withstrong government support it would be possible to have a one-megawatt prototypein orbit by 2011 that would allow for testing of space-to-ground wireless powertransmission. Within 15 to 20 years (i.e., 2015 to 2020), it envisioned an“intermediate-scale” solar power plant roughly 10 megawatts in size that couldbeam power to the Earth or an outpost on the moon. This prototype could alsodemonstrate its future contribution to space exploration.Large prototypes in the one- or two-gigawatt category would enter orbit after2025, SERT projected. These stations would have roughly the same power capacityas a modern nuclear power reactor and, like a nuke plant, could supply thispower to Earth 24 hours a day. If we wanted to go even larger we’d have to waituntil after 2050, when giant 10-gigawatt solar stations might be deployed on acommercial basis. “Such systems might find application in providingvery-large-scale power to terrestrial markets, for the industrial development ofspace resources, or in powering robotic probes to near-interstellar space duringthe latter portion of this century,” explained NASA’s John Mankins duringtestimony to a U.S. House of Representatives science subcommittee in 2000.5[e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-5] (Mankins, it should be noted, is a determined promoterof space-based solar power. He ended up leaving NASA and is now promoting theconcept through his own consulting firm, Artemis Innovation.)It was around this time that Gary Spirnak, then a project engineer withsatellite builder Hughes Space and Communications Company, became preoccupiedwith the concept of space-based solar power, the opportunities and the obstaclesof making it real. He’d been aware of the idea since his college days in thelate 1970s, but as a young man he was more interested in playing baseball. Ashoulder injury put a quick end to that, so the Pittsburgh native decided tofinish up his engineering degree and enrol in the U.S. Air Force, where he wasgiven the chance to complete his master’s degree in mechanical aerospaceengineering. It wasn’t long before his career in aerospace took off. In 1986,shortly after the Challenger shuttle disaster, Spirnak was sent to CapeCanaveral to oversee intelligence missions and coordinate classified shuttleflights for the Department of Defense. It wasn’t the best of times. TheChallenger disaster put a two-year hold on shuttle missions, and Spirnak wasbeing nudged toward desk jobs that didn’t interest him. So he left the air forceand in 1991 joined Hughes, first in its D.C. office but soon after in LosAngeles, where the thirty-something engineer became project manager for a numberof advanced space initiatives.For Spirnak, a company like Hughes was a breath of fresh air. He liked thecompany’s “spunky” culture, a description that reflected the character,determination, and entrepreneurial spirit of its famous founder, Howard Hughes.“We used to joke that the reason for Hughes’ success is that nobody was incharge,” said Boerman, who also used to work under the Hughes umbrella.Spirnak nodded in agreement. “When I was in the air force if you wanted theimpossible done, you went to Hughes. If you wanted first-of-its-kind new stuff,impossible stuff, you went to these guys.” Spirnak enjoyed his time at Hughes,but after 10 years there his bosses suggested he get his MBA to round out hisrésumé. “I kind of went kicking and screaming because I was having a lot of funbuilding satellites.” It did, however, offer some time for reflection. Whilecompleting his MBA program Spirnak, who had just turned 40, began to see thatthe maverick spirit that made Hughes attractive as an employer was at risk offading.6 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-6] Military contractor the Boeing Company made a$3.75-billion offer for Hughes’ satellite manufacturing business, which in late2000 ended up merging with Boeing’s own aerospace group.“When Boeing bought Hughes it felt like I was kind of back in the air force,”said Spirnak. “Boeing was very much this command-and-control organization.Hughes wasn’t like that. It was very independent.” Spirnak figured it was timeto move on.Armed with an MBA and engineering degree, as well as experience in the U.S. AirForce and at Hughes, Spirnak found himself being courted into the lucrativeconsulting market. He had several offers, all of them financially enticing, buthis heart was in the satellite field his career was built on. That’s whenspace-based solar power, the concept that had so intrigued him as a collegestudent more than two decades earlier, resurfaced as more than just a boyishcuriosity. He approached his long-time colleague and friend Jim Rogers, a formerchief scientist at Hughes Aircraft’s optical systems division who had become anindustry consultant. “I remember telling Jim I was thinking about this idea ofspace solar power,” said Spirnak. “I told him, ‘I just think we’ve workedthrough tougher problems than this. I bet we could figure this out.’”Rogers was on the same wavelength and in 2001 the two men agreed to pursue it.They began digging into a quarter century of NASA research and found that manyof the obstacles identified in the 1970s and even the 1990s had been, or wouldsoon be, overcome. They also thought that NASA had analyzed space-based solarfrom the wrong perspective. NASA was hung up on cost, specifically launch costs,and viewed that obstacle through the lens of a U.S. space program working undera limited budget. This made huge investments in the area difficult to justifyagainst what were perceived as higher-priority government programs. As a result,the U.S. government had yet to pull the trigger on space-based solar. Meanwhile,a risk-averse private sector remained on the sidelines waiting for thegovernment to take the lead. Tired of waiting, tired of hearing calls for morestudy, Spirnak and Rogers took a different approach. Forget about government,and forget about launch costs they had no control over. They looked instead atspace-based solar generation as a profit-making business venture, albeit ahigh-risk one. They asked themselves: how can we lower the costs? And for howmuch would we need to sell our electricity to make this an economicalenterprise?Weight Loss ProgramElectricity costs in North America during the 1970s were low, and they remainedrelatively inexpensive throughout the ’80s and ’90s. For example, in 1990 theaverage all-in retail price for electricity in the United States was 6.57 centsper kilowatt-hour.7 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-7] This low cost is one of many reasonswhy space-based solar power just wouldn’t work as a business proposition or as agovernment-backed venture, particularly the way NASA envisioned it. NASA’svision and the state of technology during the 1970s and ’80s imposed otherlimitations. NASA wanted to start small, initially sacrificing economies ofscale, and from there build slowly and cautiously to something larger over aspan of several decades. The agency also saw a need to establish a space factorythat would serve as a base for the hundreds of astronauts required to physicallyassemble space-based solar power systems. There was also the fact that, in thelate 1970s, the efficiency of solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, even advanced cellsused for space applications, were limited to about 10 percent. Just one out of10 solar electrons going into a cell would come out as electricity. Of that,another half would get lost during wireless transmission from orbit down toEarth. “The whole system they envisioned from sunlight to electricity was maybe5 percent efficient,” said Spirnak.Spirnak and Rogers thought they could do dramatically better and were encouragedto learn that the high-end solar PV cells used in space applications wereexpected to reach about 50 percent efficiency by around 2015. In 2010 Boeing’sSpectrolab division, the leading supplier of solar cells for satellites, alreadysold space-ready cells that were 30 percent efficient, and a year earlier thecompany had announced it had produced cells boasting efficiency of 41.6 percent,which at the time was a world record.8 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-8] As of June 2011,the record was 43.5 percent held by a San Jose, California, company called SolarJunction. But even with these higher and higher cell efficiencies, the businesscase still didn’t work.The stumbling block was weight. Solaren had to figure out a way to dramaticallyreduce the weight of its system, otherwise it would simply cost too much tolaunch all its equipment into orbit. More efficient solar cells helped, becauseit meant fewer cells were needed to generate the same amount of electricity. Butthat alone wasn’t nearly enough. Undeterred, Spirnak and his team took a closerlook at earlier NASA designs and found what they considered a flaw in theagency’s approach. “They were trying to move electricity around in space. Whatthey saw was a big group of solar panels all connected by wires that would gofor kilometers,” he explained, adding that the copper wire required could add upto thousands of metric tons. “The wires were like a third of the weight of theirsystem, literally millions of kilograms of wire. So we looked at this andthought, ‘This just doesn’t make sense.’”In the space business (any transportation business, really), weight doesn’t justmatter — it’s everything. The more weight you have, the more launch capacity youneed. It takes tremendous amounts of energy to launch an object into space, andthat energy translates directly into cost. A 2007 report to the director of thePentagon’s National Security Space Office estimated that a single space-basedsolar power satellite of one gigawatt or more in size would weigh more than3,000 metric tons (or three million kilograms) and require 120 launches to getit into orbit.9 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-9] Based on similar design assumptions,Solaren’s 200-megawatt system would presumably require 24 launches and weighnorth of 600,000 kilograms.No matter how it was sliced, two dozen launches would kill the business case forSolaren. If copper wiring was the problem, then the solution was to design thewiring right out of the system, thought Spirnak. The company decided to tacklethis challenge in three ways.First, instead of moving electricity around in space through heavy wires, aSolaren system would move sunlight around in space and concentrate it on a muchsmaller area of high-efficiency solar cells using super-lightweight reflectivemirrors made from a durable and flexible material such as Mylar.Second, the company would have to come up with a better way of connecting thesolar cells to the power amplifier, a device that converts electricity into themicrowaves that are beamed down to Earth.Typically a high-powered vacuum tube called a magnetron would be picked for thatkind of job, but this approach posed problems for Solaren. When an electriccurrent goes into a magnetron about 85 percent of it is turned intoelectromagnetic energy (microwaves) that travels at the speed of light toward atarget on Earth. The problem is that the electricity coming out of a solar cellis high current and low voltage, while magnetrons require low current andextremely high voltages. This mismatch between current and voltage would requireexpensive and heavy power electronics to bring them in line.One alternative to magnetrons that was invented in the 1970s is a solid-stateamplifier. Like solar cells, these amplifiers are made from solid semiconductormaterials instead of vacuum tubes. These devices match up nicely to solar-cellvoltages and current but earlier designs were only 20 percent efficient, meaning80 percent of the energy that went into them was thrown away as heat. “Over thepast few years, however, there have been some breakthroughs with thesesolid-state devices, and they’re now up over 80 percent and even 90 percentefficient,” said Spirnak. “So now you can have a solid-state device like a solarcell going to a solid-state amplifier, and you can have matching voltages.” Inother words, high efficiencies were preserved but there was no longer a need forpower electronics and associated wiring. “It just gets rid of all that weightand garbage that went along with the old design,” Spirnak added.Finally, major pieces of Solaren’s in-space system would never be physicallyconnected to each other. They would float freely in orbit, some a kilometer ormore apart, kept in alignment using a combination of sensors and thrusters. Thisapproach would cut even more weight out of the system, allowing Solaren to getall the pieces in place with four or five launches — a payload totaling about125,000 kilograms, or less than a quarter of the U.S. National Security SpaceOffice estimate. The company is already in talks with manufacturers Lockheed andBoeing about using the largest available evolved expendable launch vehicles, orEELV Heavies, for the mission. The EELV Heavies are a new class of launchvehicle developed to lower launch costs by 25 percent, and the first “Heavy” waslaunched for the U.S. Air Force in 2004. Solaren will likely need six in total,including one or two for test launches. Powerful enough to drag five adultelephants into space, they cost “a few hundred million bucks a piece,” saidSpirnak. “They also take about three years to build from the purchase contractto getting them launched.” To meet its obligations to PG&E, that timeline meantthat Solaren had to get in the launch queue in early 2011.One positive development came in March 2011. Space Exploration Technologies, theprivate rocket maker founded by Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk,announced plans to build and launch the world’s largest rocket sometime in 2014.Called the Falcon Heavy, it will be able to carry twice as much weight as thenext largest EELV rocket, the Delta IV Heavy, but at one third of the cost — orso SpaceX claims.10 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-10] “We are glad to see SpaceX doingthis,” Boerman told me. “The larger lift capacity helps, because we can put moreinto each individual launch and maybe eliminate a launch, which saves money andtime. So this is going in the right direction for Solaren’s needs.” Indeed, itcould mean as few as three launches to do what NASA thought could only be donewith 24 launches.A Better MousetrapSolaren’s new model also meant that deployment would be largely automatic withremote assistance from a control center in California. There would be no need tosend astronauts up, and no need for an assembly factory. “We looked at all this,ran the numbers, and thought, ‘Wow! It works.’ We came up with some goodeconomics numbers,” said Spirnak, adding that the system, taking all energylosses into account, will be about 25 percent efficient at taking sunlight fromspace and turning it into grid-ready electricity on Earth. That’s five timesmore efficient than earlier NASA designs. Spirnak added with a just a hint ofcockiness, “We came up with a better mousetrap.”There was also icing on the cake: over the years that Spirnak and his teamworked on their design, electricity prices started to shoot up. In 2000 theaverage U.S. retail price stood at 6.81 cents per kilowatt-hour, but in theyears that followed it began to ascend.11 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-11] Indeed, bythe end of 2010 average retail prices had rocketed to nearly 10 cents, anincrease driven largely by the cost of overhauling aging infrastructure andstate government mandates to add costlier green energy to the power mix.Californians, who paid an average retail rate of 8.84 cents in 1990, paid closerto 13.22 cents in 2010 with residential customers paying on average more than 15cents. In fact, if you live in San Francisco, the headquarters for Pacific Gasand Electric, your total bill breaks down to well over 20 cents perkilowatt-hour. That means leaving a standard 100-watt light bulb on for justover two days would cost you a dollar — more than the price of the light bulb!This trend worked out well for Solaren. The power-purchase contract with PG&Egave the company a guaranteed rate, somewhere around 13 cents per kilowatt-hour.With that price, as well as a guaranteed revenue stream for 15 years, Solarencould squeeze out enough of a profit from its initial prototype system tosatisfy existing investors and lure new ones aboard. Spirnak and Rogers raisedabout $5 million from friends, family, and small investors during their firsteight years to cover the cost of designing their system and filing patents. Tofinish the 200-megawatt prototype, however, Solaren will need to raise a fewbillion dollars — the kind of cash required for a new nuclear reactor that hassix or seven times the power capacity.What will Solaren’s prototype look like and how will it operate when complete?The general design consists of five main pieces in space and one on the ground.The parts in orbit “are bigger than anything ever flown in space before,” saidSpirnak.Imagine a giant inflatable salad bowl made of ultrathin Mylar that’s about onekilometer across and is reflective on the inside. Solaren is careful not toreveal too much information for proprietary reasons, but that’s the basic idea.That gigantic salad bowl, call it the primary mirror, would always face the sun.It would be packed tightly inside one EELV Heavy and, once launched andpositioned in its proper orbit, would automatically open up like an umbrella.The primary mirror’s job is to direct sunlight to a much smaller secondarymirror that would focus the solar energy before reflecting it onto the surfaceof a separate generator module composed of tens of millions of tiny solar cells.The surface of this module will likely cover an area of half a square kilometer— maybe less depending on solar-cell efficiency. The solar cells generatedirect-current electricity that flows to a neighboring solid-state poweramplifier, which converts the electricity into microwaves. Finally, thosemicrowaves are bounced off a reflecting antenna shaped like a massive satellitedish that, like the primary mirror, is about a kilometer wide. The big dishbeams the microwave energy down to a sprawling receiving station located incentral California.Solaren plans to locate that receiving station in Fresno on fallow land lessthan two kilometers from PG&E’s closest transmission line. The receiving stationis composed of thousands of devices called rectifying antennas, or rectennas,which are tilted toward the sky like your typical sun-worshipping solar panel.The rectennas take the microwave energy beamed from space and turn it back intoelectricity that is sold into PG&E’s electrical grid. The kilometer-diametermicrowave beam becomes more than twice that wide by the time it reaches theEarth’s surface, so the receiving station must cover an area of more than fivesquare kilometers. It may seem like a large target, but from 36,000 kilometersaway it’s akin to throwing a bull’s-eye on a dart board from 50 meters away.Cutting the CordThe idea of transmitting power through the open air has fascinated people fordecades.12 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-12] In fact, it was radio inventor Nikola Teslawho first saw it was possible to not only move voices and information throughthe atmosphere over vast distances, but also electricity. With an investmentfrom financier J.P. Morgan, Tesla famously began building Wardenclyffe Tower —known also as the Tesla Tower — in 1901 in Long Island, about 100 kilometersfrom New York City. The wood-supported tower was nearly 200 feet tall and had alarge metal transmitter on the top in a half-sphere shape. It was used by Teslain those early days to experiment with wireless communications and powertransmission. In 1908 he described how Wardenclyffe would usher in a futurewithout wires:As soon as completed, it will be possible for a business man in New York todictate instructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office inLondon or elsewhere. He will be able to call up, from his desk, and talk to anytelephone subscriber on the globe, without any change whatever in existingequipment. An inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, will enable itsbearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land, music or song, the speech of apolitical leader, the address of an eminent man of science, or the sermon of aneloquent clergyman, delivered in some other place, however distant. In the samemanner any picture, character, drawing, or print can be transferred from one toanother place. Millions of such instruments can be operated from but one plantof this kind. More important than all of this, however, will be the transmissionof power, without wires, which will be shown on a scale large enough to carryconviction.13 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-13] [emphasis added]Tesla’s description of a world without wires will sound familiar toBlackBerry-addicted executives and iPhone-toting consumers, who can todaytransfer pictures to each other and download movies from the Internet withoutany need to plug in. Few would have expected such advancements three decadesago, let alone in Tesla’s day. Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer put itthis way when speaking in early 2010 at one of the world’s largest consumerelectronics conferences, “The things we take for granted now would have soundedlike science fiction in the early 1980s.”14 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-14] Untilrecently the only wire left to fall was the power cord, but those who follow thelatest technology trends know that wireless charging of gadgets over shortdistances is quickly becoming a reality.SolarenDiagram_1.ai [images/SolarenDiagram_1_fmt.jpeg]SolarenDiagram_2.ai [images/SolarenDiagram_2_fmt.jpeg]Beam Me Down, Scotty!But Tesla, who did experiments with short distances, also had a much grandervision. He believed air was a conductor, just like any conducting metal, capableof transmitting the energy equivalent of thousands of horsepower over hundreds,even thousands, of kilometers.15 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-15] “Its practicalconsummation would mean that energy would be available for the uses of man atany point of the globe,” he wrote in 1900.16 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-16] In 1927 hetalked about the possibility of sharing the great hydroelectric potential ofNiagara Falls by beaming the electricity it generated through the upperatmosphere to faraway places.17 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-17] Tesla’s dream was tobuild what he called his “World System” — a wireless transmission infrastructurethat carried voices, information, and power. On September 3, 1911, the New YorkAmerican newspaper published an illustration that shows Tesla’s World Systemproviding electricity through the air to power automobiles, trains, ships, andairplanes.As far as voices and information go, Tesla’s vision proved remarkably accurate.The same can’t be said — yet — for transferring bulk power over long distances,but Telsa’s work did inspire several generations of scientists and engineers.American engineer William Brown, who pioneered the concept of microwave powertransmission during the 1960s, has cited Tesla as a source of inspiration. Brownis credited with inventing the rectenna, the same basic device that Solarenplans to deploy in the thousands at its receiving station in Fresno. Browncaptured the imagination of Americans in 1964 by demonstrating the technology tothe national press, including media big shot Walter Cronkite. Brown flew a smallmodel of a helicopter using a microwave beam as its sole source of power.Unfortunately the U.S. Air Force, the prime target for Brown’s research, wasn’tinterested enough to fund further work, and Brown was left to finance his ownresearch during the late 1960s. It was only after Peter Glaser introduced hisconcept of space-based solar power that NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy,in the late 1970s, saw the potential of microwave power beaming and beganfunding further research. “The technology has now reached a high level ofmaturity and represents an available and possibly invaluable resource forimmediate and future use,” Brown wrote in 1984.18 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-18]If Brown were alive today (he died in 1999), he would likely be disappointedwith how little the technology has been embraced in the intervening 25 years.Certainly experimentation has continued, with the United States, Canada, France,Japan, and Russia (and the former Soviet Union) taking the lead. Canada’sstationary high-altitude relay platform (SHARP) program is one example. Duringthe 1980s government scientists built a pilotless surveillance plane that couldbe powered and remotely controlled using microwaves beamed from the ground. Theplane had its maiden flight on September 17, 1987, and flew for 20 minutes.Three weeks later they kept it flying for more than an hour. Canada eventuallydiscontinued the SHARP program, but the Japanese conducted similar flight testsin 1992.19 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-19]There’s no question that recent interest in space-based solar power has sparkednew appreciation for the potential of microwave power beaming and the need todemonstrate it at greater distances. One effort in 2008 beamed power 150kilometers from a mountaintop in Maui to a group of receiving antennas on theHawaii main island. The efficiency of the transfer was terrible, and only 20watts made it through, but for the U.S. and Japanese scientists who set it up itwas an unprecedented success.20 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-20] I got to see ademonstration of this technology myself during the International Symposium onSolar Energy From Space, a three-day conference held in Toronto in summer 2009.Nobuyuki Kaya, vice dean of graduate engineering at Kobe University in Japan,aimed a microwave beam about 10 meters across a large auditorium to power asimple robot.At the same conference, I met aerospace engineer Kieran Carroll, vice presidentof technology at SPACE Canada. Carroll told me there was huge potential formicrowave power beaming, not just from space to Earth but also between twopoints on Earth. Take the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, whichhas plenty of hydroelectric potential on Labrador but lacks the transmissioninfrastructure to bring it to the island of Newfoundland. One problem ofbuilding that infrastructure is the Strait of Belle Isle, which is 18 kilometersacross at its narrowest point. Laying transmission cables on the seafloor wouldbe expensive and risky, partly because icebergs fill the strait every winter anddrag the bottom. Carroll has proposed beaming 1,000 megawatts of hydroelectricpower from Labrador up to 30 kilometers across the strait to rectenna locationson Newfoundland. To do this successfully on Earth, Carroll told me, would be anideal way to prove that the technology will also work from space. So far, theidea has fallen flat with provincial and industry authorities, which in November2010 announced a plan to use submarine cables.I asked Spirnak about the fact that there has never been a demonstration ofmicrowave power transmission from space to the Earth’s surface. He quicklycorrected me. “At a small kilowatt level satellites do this every day,” he said.“They have solar arrays. They collect sunlight. They use solid-state amplifyingand wave tubes. The difference is [satellite providers] throw away the energyand keep the content. But it’s the exact same thing.” He pointed to DirecTV, thedirect-broadcast satellite service founded by Hughes Electronics and launched in1994. Now controlled by media conglomerate Liberty Media, DirecTV transmitsdigital television and audio signals to the United States and Central Americawith a fleet of 10 satellites, each positioned in its own geostationary orbit.Spirnak explained that each DirecTV satellite has a transmitting antenna abouttwo meters wide that sends a relatively weak microwave beam to Earth. By thetime the beam reaches our planet’s surface, it blankets about five millionsquare kilometers, or roughly half the area of the United States. Themicrowaves, which are generated by the solar panels on the satellite, need onlybe strong enough to act as a carrier of content — that is, the microwaves are aninvisible highway for transmitting TV and audio to DirecTV’s 18 millionsubscribers. “The satellite providers don’t care about the energy; they justwant the content,” said Spirnak. If each subscriber has a receiving dish that’sabout two square feet that means all DirecTV dishes together cover an area ofabout 36 million square feet. But since the satellite’s microwave beam blanketsfive million square kilometers, or the equivalent of 54 trillion square feet, itmeans 99.999999 percent of the energy beam is wasted.What makes Solaren different from DirecTV’s setup is that it has a transmittingantenna that’s one kilometer in diameter instead of two meters, and it has morethan 200 megawatts of solar power feeding it instead of just a few kilowatts. Italso has rectennas on the ground waiting to convert that microwave beam toelectricity. “So what we’re doing is focusing the energy, because we have a muchlarger aperture in space,” explained Spirnak. “We could do that with a DirecTVsatellite, and you’d have all that energy going down in two square miles. Now,they wouldn’t be very happy about only covering two square miles, but hell,you’d get a really great TV signal.”Spaced OutSolaren still does plan to conduct its own microwave power beaming tests, firstby transmitting a few kilowatts in their office laboratory and after that in thedesert, where they’ll beam a megawatt of power across a distance of one or twokilometers. The company will also conduct a beaming test from space, likely in2014, before proceeding with the pilot power plant. Though some testing isneeded, the company dismisses NASA’s notion that you have to start with a smallpower plant in space and gradually build up from there. “Space solar powerplants, without a doubt, are animals of scale,” said Spirnak. A one-megawattsystem simply won’t generate enough revenue from electricity sales to pay forthe cost of the rockets to get it there. “It’s the same reason you wouldn’tbuild a one-megawatt nuclear reactor. Regardless of size, there’s a certain sunkcost you have.”But talk, as the old saying goes, is cheap. Getting the entire system built,tested, launched into space, positioned in orbit, assembled, and operational by2016 is what the most optimistic engineer might call mission impossible. Japan,one of the few nations formally pursuing space-based solar power, doesn’t expectto have a working space station for at least two decades.21[e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-21] Recall that in 2000 the SERT program said it may bepossible to get a 10-megawatt prototype into space between 2015 and 2020, andthat would be with the full, decade-long backing of government and the resourcesof NASA. A small private company trying to get a solar power station in spaceand operational by 2016 — a station that’s 20 times larger — well, that’s boundto attract widespread skepticism.Pete Worden, center director for NASA’s Ames Research Center, is among theskeptical — not specifically of Solaren’s claims, but of the entire concept. Hecalls himself a “reformed zealot,” someone who was once a believer and devoteeof space-based solar power but after years of study and contemplation is now oneof its biggest critics. It doesn’t make sense, in his view, because it doesn’tpass the economic test. It’s overly complicated. It’s risky. “It’s fiscallyridiculous,” Worden said during an interview in 2009 on The Space Show, anonline current-events show for space enthusiasts and professionals.22[e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-22] “I really see no possibility for the foreseeable futurethat space solar power makes any economic sense whatsoever for supplying powerto the planet,” he told his interviewer. “To my friends and colleagues who areadvocates of this, I’m sorry, but Santa Claus is a long, long way from thisone.” Worden’s biggest problem with space-based solar power is that, whenstacked up against other alternatives, primarily ground-based solar powergeneration, it’s simply too risky and expensive to make a business case. Hisevidence? Silicon Valley investors aren’t lining up to support it. “We talk toentrepreneurs about this area, ones that have real money, like venturecapitalists, and you’ll find they’re not really interested,” he said.He’s got a point: why go to outer space when solar has a bright future righthere on Mother Earth? There’s no denying the role that traditional rooftop andground-based solar power systems will play over the coming years and decades ascountries around the world transition away from fossil fuels toward a low-carbonenergy mix. After all, it was Thomas Edison who famously said to Henry Ford in1931: “I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! Ihope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.”Advancements in this area have been stunning, and the cost of solar continues tofall to that sweet spot called “grid parity,” which is the point where solarpower becomes competitive with the mix of conventional power sources on theelectrical grid, mainly coal, natural gas, and nuclear.The most popular form of solar power generation is photovoltaics (PV), which canbe made from a number of different semiconductor materials. When the sunlightstrikes a solar P cell, it excites electrons in the semiconductor material andcreates an electric current. Research in the area of solar PV has focused mainlyon improving efficiency — that is, getting the cells to convert more of thesun’s energy into electricity — and on cost reduction. This has resulted indozens of different flavors of solar PV cells and techniques for manufacturingthem. Most today are made of silicon wafers, while others are made of thin filmsof silicon (made by companies such as Applied Materials and Oerlikon) and moreexotic and toxic combinations such as cadmium telluride (made by First Solar andAbound Solar) and copper indium gallium selenide (made by Solyndra and Miasolé).The advantage of these thin-film cells is that they reduce cost by requiringdramatically less semiconductor material. For example, a crystalline siliconwafer is about 350 micrometers thick — equivalent to three or four human hairslying on top of each other — while a thin film on a cell is about 1 micron, or100 times thinner than a single human hair. And because the film can bechemically deposited on a flexible substrate, like plastic, the cells can bemanufactured on a roll-to-roll process similar to how newspapers are printed,allowing for low-cost, high-volume production.The trade-off is that thin-film cells are only 6 to 9 percent efficient,compared to efficiencies of between 15 and 25 percent for cells made ofcrystalline silicon wafers. If you want to install solar panels on limitedrooftop space, you’re likely to choose a more expensive crystalline siliconpanel from a company such as SunPower or Sharp. That’s because the higherefficiency allows you to draw more electricity from a smaller area. (In space,super-expensive yet highly efficient PV cells made of gallium arsenide are usedto reduce weight, and hence launch costs. Makers of these cells includeSpectrolab and Cyrium Technologies.) On the other hand, if you own many hectaresof brownfield property and space isn’t a limiting factor, you’re likely to usean inexpensive thin-film solar panel made from a company such as First Solar,which is now manufacturing its solar modules for less than $1 per watt, downfrom $3 per watt in 2004. At the time of writing, First Solar announcedcompletion of the world’s largest solar PV facility, an 80-megawatt facilitybased in Sarnia, Ontario, not exactly the sunshine capital of the planet.23[e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-23]Research in this area continues to amaze; take southern Ontario, where I live,for example. Scientists at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, are growingsilicon nanowires that, while invisible to the human eye, stand up on asubstrate, like bristles on a densely packed hairbrush.24[e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-24] The idea here is that the sun can strike a largersurface area on a cell covered in nanowires, and more electricity can beproduced per square inch. Others are working on ways of using fewer solar cellsby concentrating sunlight with special lenses and curved mirrors. A company inToronto called Morgan Solar has developed an inexpensive concentrating opticthat could lead to solar modules that cost the same as thin-film modules butoffer three to four times the efficiency.25 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-25] Efforts arealso being made to harness more of the sun’s energy by using so-calledmulti-junction solar cells, which contain two or three layers of materials thatcan capture different parts of the color spectrum in light. Silicon, forexample, only captures a small part of the spectrum and throws away the rest asheat. By layering on other materials, such as gallium arsenide, more of thesun’s electromagnetic radiation can be harnessed. Ottawa-based CyriumTechnologies does this by using nanoparticles called “quantum dots,” which canabsorb different parts of the color spectrum, such as infrared light, dependingon the dots’ size. Organics dyes, solar “light pipes,” and solar products thatsupply both electricity and heat from the same device are among the manyinnovations driving the market forward.Here on the ground the solar market is well established and growing stronger.The International Energy Agency says electricity harnessed from the sun couldrepresent up to a quarter of the world’s total electricity production by 2050.26[e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-26] Half of that solar electricity would come from PVsystems installed on building rooftops or large expanses of land. The other halfwould come from sprawling concentrating solar power (CSP) systems that use thesun’s heat to create steam for generating electricity. This is typically done byusing sun-tracking mirrors called heliostats to focus the sun’s light, creatinghigh enough temperatures to create steam. At that point, a CSP plant works likeany other thermal plant, be it coal or nuclear. An advantage with CSP systems isthat the heat they generate can be stored (in tanks of molten salt, for example)and retrieved later when electricity is needed. All of this innovation andacceptance of solar does call into question the need to launch these systemsinto space.The Orbital AdvantageSpirnak is quick to point out that solar innovation benefits his project just asmuch as any project built on the ground. “If somebody comes up with a bettersolar cell, we’ll just plug it into our system,” he said, adding that Solaren’ssystem is basically just a clever integration of existing technologies that canbe swapped in and out as they improve.The challenge with solar technology is that no matter how far it advances andhow efficient it becomes, it will still have limitations when used on Earth.Nighttime. Clouds. Atmospheric pollution. When the sun doesn’t shine, you can’tproduce electricity, and when the skies are filled with particles that blocksunlight, the efficiency of a solar power system is reduced. In 2008 the UnitedNations Environment Programme warned of a phenomenon called “atmospheric brownclouds,” a toxic mixture of soot, sulphates, and aerosols that are dimming theskies of countries such as China and reducing their ability to produceelectricity from solar panels.27 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-27] Geography and localclimate also determine the business case for ground-based solar. Install a solarPV system in London or Moscow and you’ll produce half as much electricity as asimilar installation in Los Angeles, Cape Town, or Cairo.28[e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-28]Space-based solar power overcomes these limitations. There is no night in space.No clouds. No brown haze blocking out the sun. Solaren’s system, like allspace-based solar power designs, would provide a nearly constant, uninterruptedsupply of power like any nuclear, hydroelectric, or coal plant. It would facethe sun 24 hours a day and be capable of beaming a predictable stream of energy,and it wouldn’t be limited by where that stream could go. To London or Cairo; tothe tar sands of northern Alberta or a desert in California; to a military basein Afghanistan or a base station on the moon — the result would be largely thesame. No different, really, than the way broadcast satellites can transittelevision signals to any spot on the planet. Solaren’s receiving stations wouldalso take up 95 percent less space than a 200-megawatt solar PV plant built onland.When one looks at the great lengths people are prepared to go to tap solar poweron Earth, the idea of going to space doesn’t seem so ambitious. One example isthe DESERTEC concept, a plan to build solar PV and concentrating solar powersystems on 17,000 square kilometers of the Sahara Desert. The project, which hasbacking from industry giants Siemens, ABB, Deutsche Bank, and Munich Re, wouldinvolve building a massive grid of high-voltage DC transmission lines connectingthe Sahara to countries in Europe and Northern Africa. The price tag: $550billion U.S., based on a goal of supplying 15 percent of Europe’s electricitydemand by 2050. One might be tempted to criticize Solaren’s project because ofthe vulnerability of its solar power station to space debris and sabotage, butis the DESERTEC project any better off? The equipment it plans to use will facepotentially damaging sand storms, and placing the heart of the project in anunstable region like Northern Africa does little to alleviate the energysecurity concerns brought about by the world’s overdependence on Middle Eastoil.Still, the idea of outer space, let alone beaming energy from space, overwhelmsmany people. Jonathan Coopersmith, a technology historian at Texas A&MUniversity, has said that space-based solar power suffers from two things: thegiggle factor — “you’ve got to be joking” — and the Death Star factor — thebelief that beaming energy from space is dangerous. A reference to the giantweaponized sphere in Star Wars, the Death Star factor could prove to beSolaren’s biggest challenge in an age where some people believe even windturbines are a health risk.29 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-29] Solaren’s microwave beamwill have some heating effect and the receiving station will be off limits, butif a person happened to hop a security fence and run to the core of the beam,she could probably be there for a few minutes before exceeding exposurestandards. The company says planes and birds can safely fly through the beam,though the heat may temporarily draw some animals to it. Solaren will have to gothrough an environmental assessment before getting the go-ahead, but given thatnuclear power plants are far more complex and dangerous, the company doesn’tanticipate any deal-breakers. “This is not a giant bug zapper,” said Spirnak. Hewould be naive, however, to not anticipate some public resistance.The concept is equally overwhelming for investors. For one, most who see thepotential of Solaren’s approach still want a quick return on their investment.“That just doesn’t work for us. We’re in it for the long haul,” said Spirnak.Others are dismissive from the start. He told me about a meeting he had severalyears earlier with a potential investor at Duke Capital, a subsidiary of utilityDuke Energy. “I was going through my charts with a short presentation and afterthe second or third chart, the guy says, ‘Gary, you’ve got a typo on yourchart.’ I asked what it was, and he said, ‘Well, your power plant is in space.’I told him he was correct, and he replied, ‘We don’t do things in space.’ Thatwas the end of the meeting.” Solaren has run into the same difficulties asGeneral Fusion. Despite providing hundreds of pages of business plans anddrawings to investment banks, both big and small, most never took the time tostudy them. Added Spirnak, “They just don’t have a feel for it. Most of thefinancial community works on this follow-the-leader kind of thing. They’relooking for validation somewhere, so if you’re coming in as a first-of-a-kind,they’re just not willing to take a shot at it.”It doesn’t help that one of Solaren’s patents talks about the potential of usingits microwave beams to bust up hurricanes and modify the weather, an image thatconjures up the mad scientist Tesla and his destructive death ray.30[e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-30] In theory, the heat from the microwave energy could beused to disrupt air flows that allow hurricanes to form. Spirnak, apparently,wanted to cover all his bases and included that possible use in a patentapplication. One can only hope that we never have to resort to such riskygeoengineering experiments.For other people more familiar with space exploration and technology, even thosewho support the pursuit of space-based solar, Solaren is viewed as a black sheepthat stands apart from the flock. Part of the reason is that Spirnak doesn’tlike to attend industry conferences or share too much information with otherscientists and engineers interested in the concept, even when asked. Thatapproach has ruffled feathers, yes, but Spirnak is unapologetic. He’s notprepared to lose control over intellectual property just to satisfy thecuriosity of conference goers, and he has no interest in defending Solaren’splan to armchair skeptics in the crowd. “I’ve done my master’s thesis defenseonce, I’m not going to do it again,” he joked. “People tell us we’re hidingsomething. But this is competitive. It’s the same way Toyota doesn’t go toDetroit and brief General Motors on what cars it’s going to come out with nextyear.” In a way, it’s a sign that space-based solar is maturing beyond a cottageindustry to a more commercial enterprise. No longer is it just an academicexercise for government scientists living off NASA funding. “At the end of theday, they don’t lose their job if they don’t make this work,” said Spirnak.Upward MomentumSolaren may have an impressive design for its space system and the chutzpah topursue its development, but it also has an enormous to-do list. It has managedto attract some strategic investors with patient capital, but it will need topull in billions of dollars more in investment to turn its paper-based plan intoa space-based power station. Solaren needs to order heavy-lift launch vehicles,book time in the launch queue, secure an orbital slot, and, at the same time,build, test, and demonstrate the parts that will complete the puzzle. There areconcerned citizens and environmental groups who need convincing that itsmicrowave beam won’t kill birds, knock down planes, or cause health issues fornearby communities. It will have to prove that the clean energy from its solarpower station will far exceed the energy in the rocket fuel that will launch itinto space, and it will have to show investors how it plans to protect thesystem from space debris and its electronics from solar storms, and how it willguard against and respond to component malfunctions. Solaren will also have toexplain what happens in 20 or 30 years when its space station reaches the end ofits useful life and risks becoming part of a growing pile of orbiting spacejunk. It has to do all of this before 2016.As daunting as all this seems — and is — perhaps Solaren is in the right placeat the right time. There’s unprecedented chatter out there about the potentialof space-based solar power; the Japanese are trying to spark a solar space race;and a number of other private ventures have joined in, including Space IslandGroup, PowerSat, and Space Energy Incorporated. Electricity prices are climbing,and power infrastructure is in need of a massive overhaul. Meanwhile, climatechange and the environmental consequences of our increasingly treacherouspursuit of oil have a larger percentage of the population looking for cleaner,safer, and abundant energy alternatives. The BP oil spill, the worst in history,offered plenty of motivation for change. It was April 20, 2010, when anexplosion on the Deepwater Horizon drill rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11people and caused oil to start gushing from the sea floor at a rate of more than50,000 barrels a day for nearly three months. Shortly after the spill, BuzzAldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, issued a call to action. “The timingof the oil catastrophe,” he said, “is a great opportunity for reevaluating solarenergy from space.”31 [e02_TESLA-1.html#x2-31]Beyond producing green energy and helping to wean ourselves from oil, Spirnak isjust as keen to put infrastructure in space that will open up space exploration,pave the way for missions to distant planets, and create more space-industryjobs. “That drives us as much as anything,” he said, careful to give creditwhere credit is due. “There are a number of things that happened through nofault of our own. Had the U.S. Air Force and NASA not pumped gobs of money intosolar-cell research over the last 10 years I wouldn’t be here talking to you.Same thing had the air force not gone in after the Challenger disaster and builtup its unmanned heavy lift capacity.”To not seize these developments, to not run with them when others seem contentto walk, to not advance our access to clean energy and space, all simply toavoid the risk of failure — where’s the satisfaction in that? Peter Glaserinvented the concept more than four decades ago, and he’s still waiting for hisdream to become reality. In his unpublished memoirs, Glaser lamented what heconsiders the self-imposed limitations of humankind: “Our inability to see thefuture except as the continuation of the present is the reason that we let ourimagination be bound by commonly accepted perception, despite all evidencepointing to an acceleration of change.”But just because we can do something, does it mean we should?

If only mankind could harness that energy,rather than be at its mercy.”— “The Power of Spin,” The Economist, September 29, 2005Tornados have always amazed me, but they’ve also been a source of recurringnightmares. In my dreams I see them forming outside the window of my house, oras I walk down a dirt road in the countryside. I try to run, but the menacingthings always seem to follow me. Maybe the tornado scene from The Wizard of Ozleft a deep impression on me as a youngster. I can remember being terrified as a15-year-old by news coverage of the devastating tornado north of Toronto inBarrie. On that day in 1985, a total of 13 tornadoes created mayhem acrosssouthern Ontario, two of them rating an F4 on the Fujita scale. This meant theirwind speeds surpassed 330 kilometers an hour, and one of the tornadoes carved apath of damage more than 400 meters wide. Of the 12 who died, most receivedlethal blows after being lifted into the air and tossed back to the ground.1[e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-1] Dozens of people were injured by flying debris andhundreds of homes and businesses were torn apart. I could only imagine what itwas like to live in Tornado Alley, America’s most active tornado zone, an areabetween the Rocky and Appalachian mountains that stretches north from centralTexas all the way to the Canadian prairies. The top 10 deadliest tornadoes inthe United States took place between 1840 and 1954, killing about 2,500 peopleand injuring more than 9,000. Death tolls have dropped dramatically since the1960s because of improved forecasting and early warning systems.2[e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-2] Still, even today’s warning systems only give you 13minutes advance notice, and 70 percent of the time they’re false alarms.3[e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-3] Residents of Joplin, Missouri, had heard so many tornadowarnings during a five-day period that they were caught off guard on May 22,2011, by a ferocious twister that wiped out a third of their town. They hadreceived a generous 20 minutes of advance warning, but it didn’t seem to help.The kilometer-wide tornado, labeled the deadliest U.S. twister in more than sixdecades, killed at least 140 people.When Tesla was in his late 70s, he wrote “Breaking Up Tornadoes,” an articlepublished in 1933. In it, he argued that it was possible to use explosives todisrupt the airflow of twisters and ultimately break them up. “It is entirelywithin our power to destroy them, or at least render them harmless,” he wrote,suggesting that the government form an agency dedicated to tornado busting.“There is no doubt that, if such an undertaking were inaugurated, and many mindsset to work, effective methods and means would be eventually developed and greatloss of life and damage to property prevented.”4 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-4] Thestudy of tornado control continues to this day. Scientists in Russia put out astudy in 2009 that described the various methods that could be used to tametwisters, including heating up their tops — kind of what Solaren suggests it cando through microwave beaming of hurricanes — or cooling down their bases. Theyalso pay homage to Tesla by mentioning his “effective” explosive method.5[e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-5]There has been so much thought put into anticipating, avoiding, and destroyingtornadoes that I became quite intrigued in early 2007 when I received thefollowing email from a gentleman named Brian Monrad, a lawyer who was writing onbehalf of a friend. “An engineer in Sarnia, Ontario, says he can create anartificial tornado and use it to produce electricity,” he wrote. “Three topscientists from Oxford, Cambridge, and MIT agree that this is a real possibilityand have joined the advisory board.” Curiosity got the best of me, and a weeklater I found myself making the four-hour trek to Sarnia, where I was welcomedinto the home of retired refinery engineer Louis Michaud, inventor of thepatented atmospheric vortex engine concept.Giving It a whirlMichaud, a grandfather of four, is a slight and soft-spoken man in his late 60swho lives in a 1950s-style bungalow in a quiet area. Heavily industrializedSarnia — nicknamed Chemical Valley because of the high density of chemicalcompanies and refineries it hosts — neighbors a town called Petrolia, home toNorth America’s first commercial oil well and touted by locals as the cradle ofthe global oil industry. Michaud worked more than 25 years there as a processcontrol engineer at Imperial Oil, which is majority owned by ExxonMobil andranks as the largest petroleum company in Canada. A spare-time inventor for mostof his career, it was only after Michaud retired in 2006 that he could throwhimself into the idea of extracting energy from tornadoes. It was then that heformed a company called AVEtec Energy with an aim to commercializing his uniquevortex engine.Minutes after we met, he took me to his garage to demonstrate a small-scaleversion of what he’d like to build, one day, on a massive scale. In his garage,between hanging bicycles and a tool bench, sat a hollow plywood cylinder abouttwo feet high and nearly four feet in diameter. It had a round opening at thetop, just big enough to stick your head into. At the bottom was a heatingelement connected to a small propane tank. Michaud fired up the propane heaterand then lit a couple of pieces of saltpetre to get them smoking. As the heaterbegan warming the bottom of the cylinder the air within it began to rise,carrying with it the smoke from the burning saltpetre. Within seconds, therising saltpetre smoke started swirling and took on the shape of a vortex — aminiature tornado. A few minutes later, Michaud turned off the propane andopened the door to his garage to let out all the smoke that had accumulatedinside. A woman walking her dog passed by on the sidewalk and looked oncuriously; she probably thought we were smoking marijuana in the garage. I feltlike Jeff Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.The demonstration, though interesting, could have easily been a high-schoolscience fair experiment. Back inside the house, Michaud fixed me a cup of teaand began explaining his vision. The garage demonstration, he said, was just toshow how heated air can be made to spiral as it rises. His idea is to build astructure that would support the creation and control of a tornado-like vortexthat stretches many kilometers into the sky and spins at more than 300kilometers per hour, as powerful as an F4 tornado capable of seriousdestruction. Why on Earth would anyone want to do such a thing? To generateclean electricity. A tornado needs to sweep in warm air from ground level inorder to survive, so any supporting base structure would need air-intake ducts,and those ducts could be equipped with turbines. The powerful suction of airthrough those ducts would spin the turbines and generate electricity, Michaudexplained. “I’m talking about a 200-megawatt device here,” he said. “It would be200 meters across and the vortex would be one to 20 kilometers high. It wouldhave 10 turbines installed around its base, each producing 20 megawatts.”The key, he said, is to find a large source of low-grade heat that can get thetornado going, just like the propane heater he used in his garage prototype. Onedependable source is waste heat from thermal power plants. Nuclear and coalpower stations, as well as certain types of natural gas–fired plants, convertonly one-third of their fuel into electricity. The rest of the energy in thatfuel gets rejected as waste heat. That means a plant that produces 500 megawattsof electricity is throwing away the energy-equivalent of 1,000 megawatts ofheat. That heat is released into the air using dry or wet cooling processes, orit can be absorbed into water and discharged into a large lake. It’s aridiculous situation, said Michaud. “We produce warm, humid air and just throwit away. In fact, we put fans on top of these cooling towers to get rid of theair, and we use a lot of power to drive the fans.” He’s not kidding: justrunning fans alone on a mechanical draft cooling tower eats up about threepercent of a generating station’s power output.6 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-6] Michaudsaid that waste heat can be used to fuel a man-made tornado capable ofgenerating 200 megawatts, which would improve the efficiency of a thermal powerplant by 40 percent and offset the need for and cost of a cooling tower.Presumably, waste heat from solar thermal power plants could also be used. “Theprocess could be developed with relatively little engineering effort,” accordingto Michaud’s business plan.All of this might sound impossibly ambitious, but it’s just the start. Longerterm, Michaud sees the potential of building his vortex engines along tropicalcoastlines or on floating ocean platforms along the equator. Heat could beendlessly extracted from tropical waters as a way to sustain power-producingtornados. These same warm waters, which can reach as high as 32 degrees Celsius,are the source of energy for hurricanes and spontaneously appearing waterspouts. “The passage of a hurricane can reduce surface temperature by up to 5degrees Celsius,” said Michaud. “They basically carry heat away from thesurface.”Man-made tornadoes would achieve the same goal, drawing heat from the surfacethrough the center of their vortex and dumping it into the upper atmospherewhere it’s more than 60 degrees Celsius cooler and the heat can more easilyradiate into space, beyond the confines of the greenhouse effect. The onlydifference is that man-made tornadoes could generate electricity at the sametime. In a way, Michaud’s vortex engines would operate like massive airconditioners for a warming planet but ones that produce, rather than consume,electricity. “It’s the first energy source to contribute to global cooling, notglobal warming,” touts Michaud’s business plan. Two months after meetingMichaud, I wrote a story about his invention in the Toronto Star.7[e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-7] It captured the attention of many readers, includingSteven Levitt, professor of economics at the University of Chicago and co-authorof the bestselling books Freakonomics and SuperFreakonomics. “This is probablytoo good to be true, but all you need is one big idea like this to work,” hewrote in his New York Times blog. “Technology and human ingenuity have solvedjust about every problem we’ve faced so far; there is no obvious reason whyglobal warming shouldn’t succumb as well.”8 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-8]What Goes Up . . .The idea of harnessing heat from warm ocean waters has been around for more thana century. As mentioned in the introduction, Nikola Tesla wrote in detail aboutextracting heat from the ocean to generate electricity, a method of powergeneration called ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) that Lockheed Martinhas pursued for the last four decades. Another idea that has been around forseveral decades is the manipulation of atmospheric convection to produceelectricity, which is essentially what Michaud is attempting. Convection is oneof three major ways that energy is transferred between the Earth’s surface andthe atmosphere. The other two are conduction and radiation. Conduction happenswhen heat moves from a higher temperature substance to a lower temperaturesubstance, for example, from warm air into cold soil or warm soil into cold air.Radiation is a transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves, which you feelwhen the sunlight hits your face.Convection, on the other hand, occurs when hot less-dense air rises and colddense air sinks. Convection is why a hot-air balloon rises, and why macaroni ina pot of boiling water moves up and down — the hot water closest to the heatingelement rises to the surface, cools, and then sinks back down in a constantchurning motion. (The convection, or heat transfer, gets stronger as thetemperature difference between the bottom of the pot and the surface of thewater gets greater.) The lower atmosphere of our planet behaves, generally, in asimilar way. The sun heats the surface, causing surface air to warm up and riseto much cooler layers of the atmosphere, where the air cools and descends backto the surface.This is all somewhat orderly chaos until some sort of disturbance leads tostorms, which can trigger the formation of tornadoes. With the right windconditions, a rising pocket of warm humid air can begin to swirl, resulting in aspinning column that narrows as it starts drawing in warm air from the ground.As it narrows, it gathers speed and strength — the same way a figure skater canspin faster by pulling her arms tight against her body. The powerful tornadothat eventually forms becomes a path of least resistance through which warm airon the ground can travel kilometers into the sky to the sub-zero temperatures ofthe upper troposphere. By sub-zero, I mean between –30 and –60 degrees Celsius.(Keep in mind, this is a simple explanation of an otherwise complex weatherprocess that is still not fully understood. But the role that convection playsis clear.)One of the first individuals to think up a way to capture the energy from thisconvective process, and certainly the first person to receive a patent on adesign, was a Frenchman by the name of Edgard Nazare. Not much is known aboutNazare, but it was between 1940 and 1960 that the French scientist, stationed atthe time in Algeria, observed small sand tornadoes called dust devils in thesouth Saharan desert. Nazare, an aeronautical engineer and specialist in fluiddynamics, was captivated by the natural forces that caused these sand twistersto form. Convinced it was possible to replicate and control the process, heimagined a man-made apparatus called an “aerothermal power station” that coulddraw in warm ambient air from the desert floor and coax it to spin andaccelerate as it ascended through a 300-meter-tall tower structure. The towernarrowed at its center, forcing the air to start swirling — the same way waterstarts to spin as it goes down a drain. As with Michaud’s vortex engine,Nazare’s cyclone generator would produce electricity from turbines installedwithin the tower.Nazare received a French patent for his invention in 1964, and while hechampioned the idea throughout his career, his efforts were met with resistanceand ridicule. He became increasingly frustrated watching France aggressivelypursue nuclear power while it ignored what he considered a much safer andmorally superior technology. “Why do we systematically ignore the proposition tostudy aerothermal power stations? Every new technology has question marks,”Nazare lamented in France’s L’Ére Nouvelle, an obscure magazine that heregularly contributed to throughout the 1980s and ’90s until his death in 1998.9[e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-9] As discouraged as he was, Nazare did prove to be aninspiration for others.In the early 1980s, for example, the German government funded the constructionof a “solar chimney” in Manzanares, a rural municipality about a one-hour drivefrom Spain’s capital, Madrid. The $5-million pilot project didn’t createtornadoes, but it did take advantage of convection as a way to generateelectricity, in this case up to 60 kilowatts, or enough to power as much as 600incandescent light bulbs. The design was simple, if not very practical. An areathe size of eight NFL football fields was blanketed with a transparent sheet ofplastic, just one-tenth of a millimeter thick. A grid of metal poles lifted theplastic from the ground, just high enough to walk underneath. At the center ofthis plastic-covered area was a circular metal chimney about 200 meters high and10 meters in diameter. The chimney had a turbine, similar to a wind turbine,installed in the opening of its base.During the day, sunlight would shine through the plastic sheet and heat up theground, causing air trapped between the ground and the plastic to warm up byabout 20 degrees Celsius. The plastic created a greenhouse effect. The warm,expanding air would then be channeled through the chimney, reaching speeds of upto 50 kilometers an hour. In essence, the chimney became a vertical wind tunnel.Air rushing straight up the chimney would spin an electricity-generating turbineinstalled at the base. The pilot project worked for about eight years until thechimney support wires rusted out and the chimney was blown over in a storm, butit did prove that the concept was scientifically sound. In fact, the solarchimney even produced electricity at night. The sun would heat the ground duringthe day, and the heat, stored in the soil, would continue to radiate from theground in the evening, warming up the air under the plastic sheets andsustaining the upward flow of air through the chimney.Overall, the solar chimney concept has much to offer. It is unique in itsability to convert low-grade heat into usable energy. A system can be builtusing cheap and abundant materials, such as plastic and metal. It is simple tooperate and maintain. It can supply a certain amount of steady (baseload) power.It also doesn’t require fancy solar cells, complex mirrors, or expensivewater-cooling systems. But the approach has its problems as well. To getmeaningful amounts of power out of such a system — that is, to get megawattsinstead of kilowatts — requires construction of a substantially taller chimney.The taller the chimney, the stronger the updraft; the stronger the updraft, themore power you can generate. (It’s similar, in a way, to water power. If youhave two waterfalls of similar volume, the taller of the two has the potentialto produce more power.)In 2001, a company called EnviroMission announced that it planned to build a200-megawatt solar chimney in southwest Australia that could generate 4,000times more power than the Manzanares system. But to get that kind of power,EnviroMission must construct a solar chimney that’s 130 meters in diameter and1,000 meters tall, which is more than 11 times the height of the Statue ofLiberty and nearly twice as tall as Toronto’s CN Tower. Keep in mind that theworld’s tallest structure, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, is 828 meterstall, meaning EnviroMission would have to break a world record for its solarchimney to become a reality. Also, to create enough warm air to flow throughthat chimney will require a plastic- or glass-covered solar collection area ofup to 35 square kilometers, roughly equivalent to 5,000 NFL football fields. Theproject is expected to cost nearly $1 billion.EnviroMission has two more solar chimney projects planned for Arizona and, in2011, secured $30 million in funding to cover early development costs. Solarchimneys are also being considered in other parts of the world. Projects are onthe drawing board in the European Union and Africa, including a solar chimney inNamibia dubbed “Greentower” that would reach 1.5 kilometers into the sky andrequire a solar collecting greenhouse covering 37 square kilometers. None ofthese commercial-scale projects have reached construction phase, and there’s nocertainty they will.Enter the VortexLouis Michaud wasn’t aware of the Manzanares project until a year or two afterit was built, but he was quite familiar with the solar chimney concept. The ideahad been floating around since the early 1900s, when Spanish Colonel IsidoroCabanyes first described his “solar engine project” in a magazine articlepublished in 1903.10 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-10] In 1931, German author Walter deHaas, writing under the pseudonym Hanns Günther, proposed the use of solarchimneys — also known as solar updraft towers — as a way to generate electricityin a world that he believed would run out of coal.11 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-11]Michaud was delighted to see the Manzanares project built, because itdemonstrated how warm, expanding air could be converted into mechanical energyas it is carried upward by convection. But in his mind, solar chimneys areinefficient and not very practical, specifically because of the dramatic heightsneeded to generate megawatts of power. “The cost of the chimney is justincredible,” he once told me.This is part of the reason Michaud, some time in the mid-1970s and while workingin a Quebec paper mill, turned to the idea of creating tornadoes to generateelectricity. It was a hobby, really, a personal project that grew out of hisside interest in meteorology and his on-the-job exposure to convective processesin an industrial setting. He knew that tremendous amounts of energy could beharnessed through atmospheric convection and saw the solar chimney as one way ofdoing it. At one point, he even considered the use of a chimney-like tube heldhigh in the sky by a blimp, but it just wasn’t practical or efficient enough.Then it struck him: tornadoes are their own chimneys. Not only that, theseself-swirling columns of air can stretch several kilometers high.If you think about it, the purpose of a physical chimney is to prevent cooler,higher-pressure ambient air on the outside from mixing with lower-pressure warmair as it flows up through it. The high-pressure air desperately wants to mixwith the low-pressure air, but if this happens it will weaken or kill theconvection process. The beautiful thing about a vortex is that it doesn’t needthis physical separation. Instead, the centrifugal force created from its rapidspinning makes an air wall that effectively pushes back on the surroundingambient air that’s trying to muscle its way inside. As a result, the column ofwarm air within the vortex can rise to great heights with little interruption.Michaud, realizing that the sky was literally the limit, turned his attention tomaking tornadoes.It was soon after this realization that Michaud discovered the work of EdgardNazare. Michaud was intrigued by Nazare’s ideas and began corresponding with theFrench scientist in 1973 and through much of that decade. Back then, of course,they didn’t have the advantage of the Internet and email, so their exchangeswere in no way frequent. In fact, there was little contact between the twoinventors during much of 1980s. Michaud was hired as a process control engineerat Imperial Oil (known under the trade name ESSO) and immersed himself in hisnew refinery job, to the point that he stopped publishing research papers andput aside his work on “tornado power.” It still occupied his mind, however, andthe new job proved crucial to refining his ideas. “One of the reasons I went towork at ESSO is that the petroleum industry had a lot of applicable techniquesfor what I was studying,” Michaud recalled during an interview in spring 2010.He said a large petroleum refinery might have half a dozen cracking furnaces, 10compressors, and 6 distillation towers. It was the perfect learning ground.“You’re able to use those assets, and surprisingly there are a lot of convectionprocesses there. You end up learning from the real world, rather than justcomputer simulations.”Fast forward to 1992. Michaud checked the mail one day and found a large brownenvelope sent to him by Nazare. “It was all his papers,” said Michaud, who wasin his late 40s at the time and didn’t realize that Nazare was well into his70s. “He was passing on the torch to me, I guess. He figured I was the personmost likely to bring the concept forward.” Michaud believed that Nazare, havingworked on the concept for most of his life, was disappointed that it nevergained mainstream acceptance. “He was looked at as a bit of an odd ball. He hadto self-publish and after a while got frustrated. It was good for me to see whathappened to him, because I realized I had to make sure I explained the rationalebehind what I was proposing.” Michaud said one tool Nazare never had during hiscareer was the Internet, which would have made his work more accessible andgiven him a way to collaborate with like-minded individuals around the world.Without that community, Nazare remained a scientific renegade within France’sconservative scientific establishment.Michaud felt a personal obligation to Nazare to carry the concept forward. Hecontinued to refine his ideas through the 1990s, but it was only during thelead-up to his retirement in the first few years of this century that he beganto promote the commercial potential of tornado power. He drew up a detaileddesign for a utility-scale vortex engine in 2001 and filed for a patent the sameyear.12 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-12] In 2005, a year before his retirement, hecreated a website, VortexEngine.ca, and populated it with as much explanatoryinformation as possible as part of a larger effort to raise awareness of theidea. He developed a business plan and started work on a small-scale prototype.Michaud also knew he needed some credible backing, so he reached out to theworld’s top climate and atmospheric scientists, many of whom agreed to beinformal advisors. One of those scientists is leading hurricane expert KerryEmanuel, a professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology. Emanuel, who has read Michaud’s papers and is in occasional emailcontact with the Sarnia engineer, said in an interview that there’s no doubt inhis mind the vortex engine will work. “It’s mechanically very simple, and that’sthe beauty of it,” he said. “One of the nice things is that it achieves athermodynamic efficiency you wouldn’t expect, with the advantage that it canoperate on low-temperature waste heat.” The proposed Australian solar chimney,for example, can convert at most about 3 percent of the thermal energy itcollects into electrical energy, while Michaud’s vortex engine can convertcloser to 20 percent. “So, for sure, this is something worth exploring,” saidEmanuel.Forging OnBy the time I met Michaud in spring 2007, he was working full time on his vortexengine and trying to raise money to construct prototypes that were much largerthan the small demo in his garage. He had managed, through an Ontario governmentprogram, to partner up with the University of Western Ontario to run computersimulations, but that wouldn’t be enough to excite investors. People want to seereal-life tornadoes, not computer screens. But taking his idea from aone-meter-diameter garage prototype to a commercial power facility up to 200meters across? Building a vortex engine capable of producing a tornado over akilometer high? Well, that wouldn’t so be easy. For one, it requires asignificant injection of capital. Just building a four-meter-diameter prototypewould likely cost $300,000. A pre-commercial model between 10 and 50 meters indiameter, connected to a large steam source and equipped with smallpower-generating turbines, might cost several millions of dollars. At this size,Michaud has wondered whether an amusement park, such as Walt Disney World, mightwant to build one of his tornado machines as a tourist attraction.Any larger and it gets really expensive, though still a deal compared to a solarchimney. Michaud has pegged the price of a full-scale facility about 100 metersin diameter at roughly $60 million. At that size, it would generate 200megawatts of power using waste heat ejected from a thermal power plant fueled bycoal, natural gas, or uranium.13 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-13] To build an evenlarger stand-alone facility that could extract heat from tropical ocean waterswould cost north of $200 million. This tropical facility would be capable ofgenerating up to 500 megawatts and would have a diameter of 200 meters, allowingfor the creation of a monster F4 or F5 tornado.It sounds like a lot of money and it sounds a little — well, maybe a lot —crazy. But what should matter more is the payoff. If you believe Michaud’scalculations, his atmospheric vortex engine is an economic slam dunk. He figuresit could generate electricity for less than 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, andpossibly as low as 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, making it a better deal thannuclear and natural gas, far cheaper than renewables such as wind and solar, andcompetitive with the dirtiest of coal plants. The capital cost of building hisvortex engine facility would be about $300,000 per megawatt, or about a quarterof what it would cost to build a new coal plant of the same power output. Morethan that, it eliminates the need for a conventional cooling tower that, at anew power plant, would cost just as much, if not more, to build. “From anengineering perspective, building this is not really a big deal,” said Michaud.He firmly believes his power-generating vortex engine is one of the lowest-costoptions for producing electricity, particularly zero-emission electricity.Since our first meeting in 2007, I’ve checked in with Michaud occasionally forprogress reports. He’s still pushing, still networking, still spreading theword, but not much has happened in four years. The largest prototype he hasbuilt to date is only four meters in diameter; it was tested in summer 2008 andcreated twisters more than 12 meters high. Decent enough, but like any newtechnology that requires an openness of mind and a willingness to take risk,finding the public granters or private investors who can take the project to thenext level has proved to be a major hurdle, at least for now. Of course, thereare some small exceptions. One was a lady in British Columbia who read aboutMichaud’s tornado power concept in the San Francisco–based magazine Ode. Shetook a $100 “carbon tax” rebate check issued by the B.C. government and decidedto sign it over to Michaud. “I think we should be putting as much money aspossible into alternative energy research, so I would like to give my $100 toyou for your project,” she wrote him.The media, of course, love Michaud. Who can resist writing about a retireetrying to make powerful tornadoes to supply electricity to towns and cities?Unfortunately for him, coverage hasn’t translated into financial support or awillingness on the part of any utility to give his vortex engine a spin. “It’snot an incremental step from somebody saying, ‘This is interesting’ to somebodysaying, ‘I’m going to invest in this,’” said Michaud. In other words, the vortexengine is fascinating enough to open doors, but too “out there” to get signedcommitments. “The utility industry is very conservative. I was contacted by theTennessee Valley Authority after one article, and the manager of technicalinnovations there was quite interested. I prepared a presentation and sent it,but once she talked to her boss it was the end of the discussion.” Michaudopened up a similar conversation with Alberta power utility TransAlta, whichoperates a 500-megawatt natural gas plant in Michaud’s hometown of Sarnia. Itended the same way after the local business manager escalated the idea tocorporate headquarters in Calgary. “The CEO has got to get behind it if it’sgoing to go anywhere,” said Michaud. “But once you get past the engineers, theexecutives aren’t interested.”Scientists, on the other hand, seem to gravitate toward the concept. A sign ofthe times, maybe? Nazare, you’ll recall, was shunned in his day by France’sscientific community, a time when climate change, peak oil, and energy securityin general weren’t pressing mainstream concerns. They are now. Michaud had noproblem attracting the attention of the U.S. Department of Energy’s SandiaNational Laboratories. He traveled to New Mexico in January 2009 to present hisidea to a room of 10 Sandia scientists eager to learn more. “They were awed,”recalled Michaud. “One of the directors there, Sheldon Tieszen, told me directlyhe wanted to personally work on this thing.” Such a partnership with a respectedgovernment lab would have been invaluable to Michaud, and indeed, Sandia appliedfor funding through BRPB-E — the U.S. government’s cash-flush Advanced ResearchProjects Agency (Energy) — so it could demonstrate Michaud’s cyclonic creationas part of a CO2 capture system that could generate electricity at the sametime. Their application was unsuccessful.Reality CheckI think it’s time to tackle the elephant in the room, and it’s a big elephant,right? Here we have a man who wants to create tornadoes in order to generatepower. But tornadoes have killed thousands of people in North America over thepast hundred years and caused billions of dollars in damage. They are powerful,destructive, unforgiving, unpredictable, and feared. So the biggest questionisn’t whether we can create tornadoes, it’s whether we can control them. Andeven if Michaud makes a convincing case that they can be controlled, and thatthe risks are extremely slim of a tornado hopping its concrete pen andterrorizing a town like Godzilla let loose on Tokyo, does it even matter? Canthe fear factor be overcome? Can the barrier of negative public perception besurmounted?Seeking advice on how to move his invention forward, Michaud traveled to Torontoin spring 2010 to meet with Tom Rand, who heads up the clean technology practiceat the MaRS Discovery District, a kind of public-private incubator fortechnology ventures. Rand acts as an advisor at MaRS; in his private life, he’sa big investor in and champion of clean energy and green technologies. He’s alsoa practical man, someone who has run his own high-tech businesses in the past,so when presented with Michaud’s idea, he was intrigued but doubtful of itscommercial viability.“I’m sure in theory it works,” he told me shortly after meeting with Michaud.“But seriously, we’re going to control cyclones that reach into the sky? Peoplehave a hard time visualizing the risks that might be involved and the regulatoryhurdles. The endgame is hard to imagine. Building hundreds, even thousands ofthese things is hard to imagine. You have to imagine thousands of these man-madecyclones being controlled. But how do they affect the upper atmosphere, airroutes, and weather systems, among other things? It may not be a big deal in theend, but when you look at this you’re thinking, ‘Holy crap, that’s a lot to getthrough. I’d rather just drill holes and take energy out of rock.’”That reticence Rand described translates into that innovation killer calledrisk. Michaud can invent a better, cleaner, and cheaper way to generateelectricity, but what matters most is whether big utilities and big banks canaccept the risks, said Rand, even if those risks aren’t as high as they seem.Banks, he said, are “allergic” to technology risk. Utilities, Michaud hasalready learned, are culturally resistant to change. Inventiveness andrisk-taking are not part of their DNB. As Lynne Kiesling, an economist atNorthwestern University once said, the “electric power industry is one of theleast innovative industries in the modern economy.”14 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-14]Proven reliability is what matters most, and efficiency — even cost — isroutinely sacrificed to assure that new equipment or processes or systems willnot fail. “There’s a psychological momentum out there that things, as they are,are largely working in the world,” said Rand. “So there’s no reason for anyoneto put their career on the line to support something new.” It’s difficultenough, he added, building support for less risky, better-proven options alreadyon the table, such as geothermal, concentrated solar thermal, and offshore wind.“Inventors can think they’re solving a problem, but they’re not solving aproblem. They’re just putting another option on the table. There are alreadylots of people who can make clean power and at less risk, and their products arenot getting installed. So I often ask the people I advise, what makes you thinkwhat you have can get installed?”It’s not difficult to get Rand worked up about this issue. He, like many of theinventors and entrepreneurs he advises, is frustrated with the chasm that existsbetween pure innovation on one side and deployment of that innovation on theother. “The people who get paid to make our machinery run, they get paid to keepit running, not to change direction. Who’s going to stick their necks out? Whywould you stick your neck out? Imagining hundreds of cyclones creating energy isnot going to help unblock those institutional blockages. These days you need tode-risk, de-risk, and de-risk some more to make it all easier to swallow.Michaud’s invention, this just does the opposite, and sadly, it may just be anissue of perception,” he said. The bottom line on this project? “This will scarethe shit out of bankers.”Michaud understands the concerns, and while he finds them exaggerated, he alsounderstands that perception, the same one that kept Nazare from realizing hisdream, is powerful. Still, many of our activities on this planet are dangerousand highly risky, be it sending workers kilometers underground (the 2010 Chileanminer saga) or going deep drilling offshore for oil (BP’s Gulf of Mexico spill)or building containment ponds for toxic sludge (Hungary’s “red mud” flood ofarsenic, lead, cadmium, and chromium from an aluminum ore processing facility).Capturing carbon dioxide and storing it underground is untested on a large scaleand considered highly risky given the consequences of a major leak, yet majorutilities have embraced this as a way to mitigate climate change. Michaud hasworked most of his career in refineries, which are constantly at risk of majorexplosions and toxic gas leaks. Described by some as “barely controlled bombs,”oil refineries need multiple backup systems and 24-hour supervision to keep themfrom setting off. Yet we live with them. As a society, we’ve also become quitetolerant of nuclear fission power despite the highly radioactive waste itcreates and the ever-present risk of a radiation leak or Chernobyl-typedisaster. Japan’s Fukushima crisis might be a setback for nuclear, but therewill remain a resigned acceptance of it.“At first they think my vortex engine is crazy. Then once they believe it’spossible, they start saying it’s dangerous,” said Michaud. “But I don’t thinkit’s dangerous at all. It’s actually relatively simple technology, and comparedto nuclear power, it is peanuts.” The reason Michaud believes his vortex engineis safe is because its lifeline — that is, the heat source that starts it up andkeeps it alive — can be easily controlled or severed. A typical vortex enginefacility, one large enough to produce 200 megawatts, would be contained within around concrete or steel arena more than 100 meters in diameter and about 50meters high — no larger than a typical natural draft cooling tower used alreadyby most of the world’s nuclear plants. The tornado created would rise out of thecenter of the arena and reach more than a kilometer into the sky, but it wouldget its energy through 20 or so air-intake ducts equally spread around thearena’s base. Upon startup, fans would be used to blow warm, humid air from thewaste heat into the bottom of the arena at an angle, so that the warm air startsspinning inside. As the spinning air rises, it begins reaching for the coolerambient temperatures above, gathering momentum until a tornado forms. At thatpoint, there is no longer a need to blow air into the arena; the tornado takeson a life of its own and begins sucking air into the arena through the intakeducts. As a result, the electricity-consuming fans that first blew air into thearena start operating like turbines that spin as the tornado draws air throughthem. As the turbines spin, they generate electricity.Michaud said the air-intake ducts are the key to controlling the tornado: “Thestation can only let in so much air because the [air-intake] openings are only acertain size. Each opening has a damper that can be shut down.” In other words,by restricting air flow into the arena, a utility could easily weaken orcompletely shut down its power-producing vortex engine at any time. I put thequestion to meteorologist Emanuel, who would know better than anyone else therisks involved with Michaud’s vortex engine. “Only under very extraordinarysituations would it be a problem, and those are the circumstances in which anormal tornado might form anyway,” Emanuel told me.Comfort FactorEmanuel did have one concern: “I might worry a bit about how a rotating updraftmight pose a risk to aircraft. I wouldn’t want to fly a hot-air balloon intothat.” But even here, the risk may be negligible. More than 1,000 tornadoes formeach year in the United States, according to the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration, and predicting when and where they will form isvirtually impossible. This unpredictability would seem a greater danger toaircraft than man-made tornadoes that can be easily controlled and clearlymapped out for all aviators to see.There are many other possible objections, ranging from concerns over visual andnoise pollution to the impact on birds and bats. Michaud said the amount ofdebris caught up in a tornado determines to a large degree its loudness orvisibility. It’s generally understood that much of the destructiveness of atornado has to do with the dust and debris that whips around within its powerfulvortex. Leaves, dirt, broken tree limbs, hail, fragments from destroyedbuildings — even farm animals and vehicles — all of this material captured by atwister would explain its menacing look, as well as why it might sound like afreight train coming at you from a distance. The only thing visible in Michaud’svortex engine would be some water vapor, making it a bore by comparison. “Youmight actually want to have a lightshow on it at night with different coloredlights to make it stand out,” said Michaud. As for noise, he said much of itwould be contained within the arena facility. “You could also find other ways tomuffle it.”Birds and bats? Guesswork wouldn’t be an option. Understanding the impact therewould require detailed study of full-scale prototypes, but to do it means thosefull-scale prototypes need to get built, creating a classic chicken-and-eggstandoff. There’s also the weather modification element of Michaud’s invention.It can, after all, encourage precipitation to fall by creating moisture-filledfunnel clouds above it. If you live in drought-inflicted regions such as theU.S. Southwest or Australia this might be appreciated, but not so much inEngland or other places that suffer from too much rainfall. Many people wouldconsider this kind of “geoengineering” forbidden territory, on parphilosophically with cloning humans and or creating new life forms in Petridishes.But beyond such controversies, there is an overarching question here. Is theopportunity too big to ignore? Are the risks, perceived or otherwise, worth thebenefits that Michaud’s vortex engine has the potential to bring? Consider thatthere are nearly 1,000 thermal power plants in the United States, mainly fueledby coal, natural gas, and uranium, in that order. They collectively supply about3,500 terawatt-hours of electricity each year to the country, or about 88percent of America’s electricity. In Canada, which has large hydroelectricresources, thermal power contributes much less — about 41 percent of powersupply or 250 terawatt-hours. Taken together, North America’s thermal powerplants generate about 3,750 terawatt-hours of electricity annually and wastejust as much energy (or more) as heat, which is dumped into the air or lakeswith potential to disturb local ecosystems.15 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3-15]Theoretically, vortex engines located beside these power plants could producearound 800 terawatt-hours, enough electricity to power Canada, New York, andMassachusetts combined. It would also mean 500 man-made tornadoes scatteredthroughout the continent and spinning 24-hours a day. If Michaud’s vortex enginecould be deployed in the tropics and proven to operate just on the heat in oceanwater instead of waste heat from a power plant, then the future possibilities —while difficult to imagine — are endless.Is it just a matter of becoming comfortable with the technology? Michaud hopesthat’s the case. If he had $1 million (he doesn’t), he figures he could build asizeable vortex engine about 15 meters in diameter that could create a smalltornado capable of reaching hundreds of meters into the sky. It might evenproduce a small amount of power, but its main purpose would be to show peoplewhat it would look like, how it would behave, and how it could be controlled. Itmight make the public more accepting of the technology, but that’s just one ofmany big steps required to take tornado power mainstream. “There will always bedeniers, like those who thought we would never need more than five computers inthe world,” said Michaud. But his bigger concern is with those who may actuallylike the idea but aren’t motivated or brave enough to get behind it. “Utilitiesjust don’t have that mentality to pursue this. It forces you to ask: who isthere to work with?”Government could play a larger role, but it isn’t. If Michaud was personallywealthy, he could self-finance construction of a full-scale commercial prototypeand test it on some isolated island in the South Pacific, but this isn’t anoption for a man surviving on a pension. An angel investor, a visionaryphilanthropist, could step in with the millions of dollars needed to take thevortex engine to the next level. Odds are, however, that the vortex engine willremain a curiosity that, like so many inventions of the past, never gets thechance to prove its worth. Whatever happens, Michaud is determined to moveforward. “I could work as a consultant and get more money for my effort, butthis is something I like doing,” he explained. “I figure, if you realize there’sa potential there and nobody else is doing anything about it, it’s just notright for me to say, ‘Okay, nobody is listening to me, I give up.’ I’m preparedto keep going.”Some may feel it’s a bad idea for Michaud to mess with Mother Nature. Otherswill argue that Mother Nature has a lot to teach us about solving human-causedproblems. Jay Harman, as you’ll read in the next chapter, would count himselfamong the “others.” He has devoted his life to observing and emulating nature,and after years as a lone runner, his efforts are beginning to pay off.Notes:1 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3x1] Anne O Carter et al., “Epidemiologic Study of Deathsand Injuries Due to Tornadoes,” American Journal of Epidemiology 130, no. 6(1989): 1209–1218.2 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3x2] U.S. Department of Commerce National Climatic DataCenter (data updated to April 2008).3 [e03_TESLA-1.html#x3x3] Samantha Davies, “Largest Tornado Study in HistoryTaking Place in Tornado Alley,” NBC Dallas Fort Worth affliate website.

That is to say, he doesn’tlike dressing up in business attire. He’d rather be hiking in the WesternAustralian bush or, even better, spearing pink snapper off some stunning coralreef, as far away as possible from corporate boardrooms and all the hobnobbingof industry conferences. One might say it’s the boy inside the man. Harman spentmost of his childhood during the early 1960s literally immersed in nature. Heroutinely ditched school to hang out on the beach, to snorkel, explore, andobserve. At age 10, he was already an enthusiastic spear fisherman, and by 18 hewas state junior champion. “When you’re diving, there’s no trace of humanity,”Harman, now in his 60s, told me during an afternoon chat. “It’s just you and thewild flying through a water-thick atmosphere.” As a young adult, Harman workedfor Western Australia’s fisheries and wildlife department on coastal patrolboats and even became captain of his own research vessel. The ocean and thestrange, fascinating animals and organisms within it became his second family.His second nature.More influential on his work, Harman’s intimate relationship with the oceantaught him as much about fluid dynamics and energy efficiency as any universityeducation could. “Nothing is left still in the ocean,” he said. “The medium ismoving. The fish, animals, everything is moving. By watching this, I discoveredthere are commonalities in all motion in our universe. What I was able to see asa kid was the essence of motion.” For example, he observed that sea kelp, a typeof large seaweed, had this amazing ability to stay in one spot, seemingly fixedto the coral below it, despite being battered by the ocean surf during storms.At first he figured these long strands of kelp had strong roots that anchoredthem firmly to the coral, but one day he grabbed a strand and realized theseaweed could be pulled out almost effortlessly. He eventually realized that theribbon-like kelp could hold its ground by changing itself into a spiral shape,which let the water rush past it with minimal resistance.This spiral pattern stuck in Harman’s mind, and he began noticing it more andmore — both under and above the water. Look at the cross section of a nautilusseashell and you’ll see a spiral structure. The cochlea of the human ear is aspiral shape. Sunflowers, pinecones, pineapples, and artichokes all have spiralpatterns in their biology. From something as tiny as a DNB strand to waterwhirling down a sink drain to tornadoes and hurricanes to entire galaxies, thespiral shape is a recurring pattern in nature. Even the microscopic pores in ourskin are spiral shaped. It occurred to Harman that this pattern is there formany reasons, one of which is to streamline the flow of anything fluid,including gases such as air and apparently even human sweat. Over millions, evenbillions, of years life has evolved to create ideal shapes that reduce theirfriction on the surrounding environment or take advantage of natural air andwater flows. This is why Louis Michaud’s vortex engine is so appealing; the airflow that both forms and fuels a tornado is a time-tested demonstration ofnature’s efficiency.You may have heard of the Fibonacci sequence, named after the 13th centuryItalian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Leonardo Fibonacci. Thesequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 . . . — can you spot thepattern? Any number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers.Expressed geometrically, the Fibonacci sequence forms a spiral, observedrepeatedly in nature. Harman, while working at the department of fisheries andwildlife, studied these geometries and their relationship with natural flow.Realizing that spirals, not straight lines, were the path of least resistance innature, he asked himself: can industrial equipment be designed to take advantageof these naturally efficient flow geometries?During much of the 1980s and ’90s, he didn’t just try to answer that question,he quit his job at the fisheries department and set about designing products toprove that, yes, shapes found in nature have much to teach us about industrialdesign. This was preceded by a brief detour to college, where the Jesuit-raised29-year-old decided to enrol in religious studies with a focus on easternmysticism. It may seem like an odd path, but Harman knew that many religioussymbols and icons throughout the ages have been based on naturally occurringshapes and patterns, including spirals. “In my own way, I was able to link thisancient recognition and knowledge of these patterns and what I’d observed innature,” he said. “It gave me a better understanding of how things function, andhow to get the best out of technology.” He traveled the world studying under anumber of different religious teachers. Eventually, Harman ran out of money andat 32 returned to Australia, where he decided to start up a technology researchfirm with a $40,000 loan from a friend. He gained valuable experience running abusiness, and two years later he successfully took the company public and soldhis shares. Around the same time, Harman began designing high-performancesurfboards, canoes, and boats based on the shapes of whales and dolphins. Onedesign, his transparent Goggleboat, was the world’s first all-plastic, seamlessmarine craft, while a series of rescue boats dubbed WildThing won awards fortheir light weight and durability.[images/120_fmt.jpeg]PAX's Lily Impeller, which truly mimics the shape of the flower it's namedafter.Harman, like the ocean he had observed all his life, remained restless andrelentless. Despite having great success with his boats, he was determined toimprove their performance even further and, in 1991, set about designing a newtype of propeller based on the spiral shape of water as it goes down a drain.Somehow he managed to freeze the whirlpool shape in a bathtub as the waterdrained, and he took a cast of that shape as a model for his prototypepropeller. He called it the Lily Impeller because of its close resemblance tothe X-ray image of a calla lily, which has a spiral shape. It blew away thecompetition. “Every field of movement in our universe shares the same algorithmthat the whirlpool in the bathtub does,” explained Harman. “Once I had designedthat propeller, I then had fans, I had pumps, and on and on from there.” Thenliving in California, he experimented for several years until 1997, when he andhis wife, Francesca Bertone, founded the company PAX Scientific in San Rafael.Its corporate mission, according to its website, is to “bring the exceptionalefficiencies of natural flow to fluid-handling technology” — everything fromfans, propellers, and turbines to pumps, mixers, and heat exchangers. In otherwords, making anything that moves or is moved by fluids or gases do more workwith less energy.The idea of having a better, more energy-efficient design for something asrudimentary as a fan or propeller might sound, well, boring. In the world ofenergy technology, it certainly doesn’t have the same headline-grabbing appealas building solar-power plants in outer space. But the movement of air alone, asHarman is quick to point out, is an enormous enterprise: companies directlyinvolved with airflow and air conditioning are nine times larger than the moviebusiness and 16 times bigger than the recording industry. Given how many ofthese products keep the plumbing and engine of our global economy flowing andhumming, the potential impact is astonishing. “When Jay first showed me what hehad, I broke down about 20 sectors it would revolutionize,” said efficiency guruAmory Lovins, co-founder and chairman of the energy think-tank Rocky MountainInstitute. Lovins was so impressed, he agreed to sit on a PBX advisory board.“What he has here could save over a tenth of the world’s energy.”With that kind of efficiency claim, you’d think the world’s industrial giantswould be lining up to license the technology or place orders. Harman saidinterest has been slowly building over the past few years, but the idea ofaltering industrial systems to accommodate new energy-saving products modeledafter the shape of a seashell initially creates more pushback than pull — muchof it routed in fear of change and hidden behind a veil of skepticism. As Harmansaid during one conference he attended in 2008, “When you come along with a‘game-changing’ design, you come across as a nutcase.”1 [e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-1]You come across as mad like Tesla.Mother Knows BestHarman isn’t the first or the only person to have designed and engineeredproducts based on observations of nature. A famous example is Leonardo da Vinci,who used to sketch designs of hang gliders and other flying machines in the 15thcentury based on his own study of birds. “When da Vinci looked at a bird’s wing,then attempted to design a wing that could carry a man aloft, he was practisinga science that today we call bionics,” wrote Philip Callahan in his 1975 bookTuning In To Nature. “In bionics, man carefully examines how nature works, andthen tries to improve his own technology by copying nature. Da Vinci was one ofthe earliest and certainly the greatest practitioner of this science.”2[e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-2]This term bionics was coined by an American doctor named Jack Steele in 1958 andbecame a familiar word for anyone who watched the hit television show The SixMillion Dollar Man during the 1970s. The main character, Steve Austin, is aformer astronaut who is so badly injured in a crash that his legs, right arm,and left eye are replaced with bionic implants designed to look and operate justlike real body parts, only stronger and faster. The show gave us the bionic man,bionic woman, bionic boy, bionic dog, even a bionic Bigfoot. Alas, it also gavethe general public a narrow view of what bionic science was all about, thatbionics was strictly about building life-like but superior body parts out ofelectronics and synthetic materials. That’s why if you ask the average personabout a commonplace product like Velcro, they’re not likely to associate it withbionic science, even though that’s exactly where the idea came from.The discovery that led to Velcro demonstrates how a simple observation of naturecan lead to a ubiquitous product we now take for granted. Swiss engineer Georgede Mestral took his dog for a hike in the summer of 1948 and came back homecovered in seed-packed burrs, which were stubbornly clinging to his clothes andto the dog’s fur. He put one of these burrs under a microscope and noticed thateach of the prickles on it had teeny hooks on the end. Not only were these burrprickles capable of piercing de Mestral’s clothing and his dog’s fur coat, thehooks on the prickles allowed the burrs to hitch a ride as far as theirunknowing carriers would take them.De Mestral realized this was nature’s intentional design. The plants flourishedif able to disperse their seeds across a large area, so evolution favored thosewith burrs that could attach to and travel with passing animals. Mother Nature’ssolution to seed dispersion inspired de Mestral to create Velcro-brandfasteners, the solution for schoolchildren everywhere who don’t yet know how totie their own shoelaces (among other applications . . .). The name Velcro, bythe way, is a hybrid of the words velour and crochet.Bionics is one of many terms that have emerged over the years to capture theidea that imitating nature — its creatures, systems, processes, and forms — caninspire innovative answers to age-old problems or simply improve the way we dothings. American biophysicist Otto Herbert Schmitt preferred the termbiomimetics, which made it into dictionaries in 1974 but was introduced bySchmitt sometime during the late 1960s. Bio-inspired engineering is anotherfrequently used but less popular term. In the late 1990s, however, the wordbiomimicry began to capture imaginations. The colorful science writer JanineBenyus came out with Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature, a bestsellingbook in which she described biomimicry as the “conscious emulation of life’sgenius” in a society too accustomed to taming or trying to improve nature, oreven worse, extracting from it with brute force.3 [e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-3] MotherNature, Benyus argued, has supplied us with 3.8 billion years of research anddevelopment through natural evolution. Why wouldn’t humanity borrow thewell-seasoned recipes from her cookbook?Biomimicry and bionics are not interchangeable terms; there is at least oneimportant difference. Biomimicry, the way Benyus sees it, has sustainability asa key goal, meaning our purpose for imitating nature is to not just innovate forthe sake of making cool products, but to come up with sustainable innovationsthat are respectful of nature. “Biomimicry uses an ecological standard to judgethe ‘rightness’ of our innovations,” she wrote. Also, innovation is more thanjust a cleaner way to generate electricity, fight disease, or make greenmaterials and chemistry. Nature-inspired innovation can affect urban planning,government policy, and even political systems.Green chemistry is one area where biomimicry is thriving, according to Benyus,who founded an organization called the Biomimicry Institute in 2005, which actsas a research clearinghouse and promotes the study of biomimicry. I had a chanceto sit down with the Montana resident during one of her visits to Toronto, whereher institute helped set up a two-year course at the esteemed Ontario College ofArts & Design that links design and engineering with biology.4[e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-4] “The industrial recipe these days is all about usingevery element in the periodic table and brute force to turn them into what youwant,” she said. “It’s all about high pressure, high heat, and high toxicity.”Bio-inspired green chemistry, on the other hand, is about achieving the sameobjective but using nature’s chemistry book. “The recipes are very elegant. Theyuse fewer elements. Water is the solvent. And it’s low heat.” The bottom line:“Life does chemistry really, really well.”One example she gave is an Australian-based venture called Biosignal, which wasfounded in 1999 by University of New South Wales biology professors PeterSteinberg and Staffan Kjelleberg. They observed that a type of red algae foundin Sydney’s Botany Bay was unique in that it was never covered in a scummy layerof bacterial slime called biofilm. Biofilm forms when bacteria get organized:the first ones to land on a surface will send out chemical signals that attractothers, kind of like how a spontaneous protest in the streets can start withjust a few people sending out messages on Twitter. “When enough of them arethere, they turn on their toxins and start forming a sugary biolayer calledbiofilm,” explained Benyus, adding that the biofilm is what help keep thebacteria hidden from antibiotics, making it more difficult to fight seriousinfectious diseases such as cholera. So how do you keep a bunch of protestersfrom using Twitter to congregate in front of city hall? If you’re an oppressiveregime, you jam their smart phones. That’s what the red algae does, Steinbergand Kjelleberg discovered. “The algae release a molecule, a furanone, into theseawater that is like bacteria’s signaling molecule, but different in that itjams the receptors of the bacteria in the area. It jams the communicationsnetwork of the bacteria,” Benyus continued. “So Biosignal has mimicked this, andthey now have a cleaning product that can create a shield for surfaces that willrepel, rather than kill, bacteria.”The idea of repelling and not killing is important, because bacteria areharmless as long as they are prevented from landing on surfaces and formingbiofilm. Trying to kill them with antibiotics and disinfectants, such aschlorine, only builds up their resistance and leads to much-feared superbuginfections that can’t be treated. But Biosignal, despite having tapped intoMother Nature’s genius, has a problem common to many disruptive innovations.Chlorine and other industrial biocides are plentiful and cheap commodities, sowhile Biosignal has a better and safer product, it doesn’t yet have the volumeof sales needed to bring down costs. It simply can’t compete against the toxicand unsustainable chemical soups we currently cook up. New energy technologies,whether focused on efficiency or production, face the same barrier. We have alegacy infrastructure of paid-for power plants and industrial facilities thatare addicted to inexpensive commodities, mainly dirty fossil fuels, that arewasteful in their consumption of energy. The big boys of industry are willing torecognize the need for change, as long as embracing it requires as little changeas possible.Wanted: Shoehorn SolutionsJay Harman knows this problem all too well. Take your typical household fan. Thereason it often has housing around it is to compensate for inefficiency. Withouthousings, the blades of the fans push air both forward and outward along thetips of the blades. The air flow isn’t focused; it’s dispersed over a wider areaand weakened as a result. Early on PBX had developed a range of fans that,because of their unique spiral design, are better at drawing in and organizingthe air, a claim that has been backed up by computer simulation researchconducted at Stanford University. The company estimated that the fan and motorcombination it had developed was 40 percent more efficient than conventionaldesigns, and yet it wouldn’t cost more to manufacture. Also, because inefficientfans have higher air friction, they tend to be noisy. The PBX fans, bycomparison, were at least 50 percent quieter. “There are about 1.5 billion ofthese fans sold in the United States every year,” said Harman. Indeed, there aremore uses for fans than just blowing air in your face on a hot day. Inhouseholds alone, there are fans for air conditioners and furnaces, ceiling fansused for air circulation, fans used in humidifiers and dehumidifiers, fans inour bathroom ceilings, above the kitchen range, and inside our home computers,hair dryers, microwave ovens, and vacuum cleaners. Harman pitched the new PBXdesign to a leading U.S. manufacturer of domestic fans, but the company, despiteacknowledging the design’s superior efficiency, wouldn’t bite. “They were veryinterested, their engineering people were interested, but at the corporate levelthey just weren’t prepared to take it on.”Why the cold feet? Even though the new design offered their customers a betterproduct, Harman said the top executives didn’t like the fact that using the PBXdesign would require a retooling of their business, representing an upfrontcapital cost they just weren’t prepared to absorb. “So in the end, we couldn’tsell it even though we had a vastly superior product,” said Harman. The realityis that companies invest many millions of dollars designing, testing, andcertifying products and then spend millions of dollars more putting themanufacturing equipment and related systems in place to make those products.Once those systems are established, the plan is to extract as much value fromthem for as long as possible. This, of course, is understandable. Would you bewilling to tear down the walls of a new home to put in better insulation? You’remore likely to replace all your incandescent light bulbs with compactfluorescent bulbs. Incremental changes are often welcome, but in an industrialor commercial context, retooling to accommodate a new, untested technology is amuch harder sell, particularly when your customers aren’t complaining about yourexisting products or clamoring for better efficiency. As Harman said, “You’vegot this intractability of an industrial world that refuses to change anything.”This situation creates demand for what I call shoehorn solutions, products ortechnologies that are designed to fit into existing equipment, processes, orinfrastructure. Shoehorn solutions are, by necessity, more incremental in whatthey offer because they’re constrained by the inflexible environment aroundthem. As a compromise, they betray their potential. I would argue this pressureto compromise is particularly intense as it relates to new methods for producingclean energy, which, in North America, gain more acceptance if they can beshoehorned into existing electricity and transportation fueling systems that arebiased toward the use of fossil fuels. These centralized systems are controlledby large, deep-pocketed players — power generators, transmission utilities, andpipeline operators — intent on protecting trillions of dollars worth ofinfrastructure investments. They are the gatekeepers of energy. If you can playby their rules, then you have a better chance of being heard, and if you canbend to their ways, you have a better chance of being adopted.For PBX it’s the same story, different context. “A lot of people say, ‘Yeah,what you’ve got there is interesting. Why don’t you make a better fan that fitsinto our completely inefficient cooling system?’” said Harman, pointing tocomputer fans as one example. “We beat every computer fan in the world, andthere are a couple of billion of them made every year. Trouble is there’s nopoint taking a really good fan and sticking it into a bad environment. Computersare simply not designed to be cooled; they’re designed to compute. So from thevery beginning, you have to start with a design that aims to eliminate heat.”If only North Americans knew how woefully inefficient they are, how it harmstheir global economic competitiveness, and how using energy more efficiently isdramatically cheaper than building new energy supplies to meet wasteful demands.Consulting giant McKinsey & Company said it was puzzled to learn in 2007 howlittle attention was paid to energy efficiency as part of efforts to lowergreenhouse-gas emissions in the United States, despite decades of publicawareness campaigns, pressure from environmental groups, and a number of federaland state programs designed to support efficiency projects. A year later, it setout to identify all energy efficiency opportunities, excluding those related totransportation. It estimated that by 2020 the U.S. could reduce energy demand by9.1 quadrillion British thermal units (BTUs), or roughly 23 percent, andeliminate 1.1 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions annually. That’s equivalentto permanently parking 200 million cars, about three-quarters of all passengervehicles currently driving U.S. roads. “Significant and persistent barriers willneed to be addressed at multiple levels to stimulate demand for energyefficiency and manage its delivery across more than 100 million buildings andliterally billions of devices,” the consultancy wrote. “If executed at scale, aholistic approach would yield gross energy savings worth more than $1.2trillion, well above the $530 billion needed through 2020 for the upfrontinvestment in efficiency measures.”5 [e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-5]To what degree can biomimicry help us achieve those energy savings? It’s toodifficult to say precisely, but researchers at the U.K.’s University of Bath didconclude in a 2006 study that insects, plants, and animals can generallyaccomplish more work with less energy, at least compared to the human-engineeredmachines that run our economy. Their research found that most “man-madetechnologies” — up to 70 percent, to be specific — had to manipulate energy andoften use more of it to overcome challenges, such as lifting a heavy load ordealing with the effects of extreme heat. The vast majority of creatures innature, or what the researchers dubbed “natural machines,” coped with theseproblems in a completely different way. “Instead, insects, plants, birds, andmammals rely on the structure and organization of their body parts andbehavior,” they found. “The solutions to problems are already built in.” JulianVincent, who at the time was director of the university’s Centre for Biomimeticand Natural Technologies, said nature has carefully sculpted organisms intoefficient machines capable of carrying out a range of engineering feats that areworth copying. “It is likely we have similar technologies to nature; it’s justthat we use them in a particularly unintelligent way,” he said.6[e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-6] In other words, humans tend to compensate forinefficient designs by using more energy. In nature, conservation of energy isan issue of survival, so efficiency of design comes first.Biomimicry and EnergyBiomimicry is an emerging field, so when surveying the landscape of energyinnovators I was surprised to find so many companies that, whether intentionallyor not, fit the category. Jay Harman is a seasoned veteran by comparison, buthis fellow “biomimics” in the energy field who are applying lessons from natureface a wall of skepticism by going against the grain, just like PAX Scientific.Vortex Hydro Energy, a spinoff from the University of Michigan, has developed anew kind of power-generating device that mimics how fish harness energy fromflowing water, even the slowest-moving rivers. Michael Bernitsas, a professor inthe university’s department of marine engineering, knew that trout and salmonhad an easier time swimming upstream when they harvested energy from smallvortices (water swirls) that occur naturally when water flows past rocks andother objects. The fish get an extra boost by pushing off these energy-packedvortices, allowing them to reduce muscle activity and save energy. Bernitsasalso knew of a naturally occurring phenomenon called vortex-induced vibration.If you stand a cylindrically shaped object in a river, you can observe smallvortices being created behind the object as water flows by it. However, thevortices don’t form at the same time — one on the left might emerge before theone on the right, resulting in an alternating pattern of energy pulses.You can see this effect if you throw a fish lure with a rounded body in thewater and start reeling it in. The lure will sway from side to side, just thekind of motion you want to attract a bite. But when the cylinder is a fixedobject, there’s no allowance for swaying. Instead you get vibration that cangather strength and cause havoc with steel risers and mooring lines, the kindsof things you might find anchoring an offshore oil platform. Bernitsas spent agood deal of his career trying to suppress how these unforgiving vibrationsaffected engineered structures, but one day it occurred to him that encouragingthese vibrations could prove an economical way of generating electricity fromslow-moving river currents, where conventional turbines just don’t work. So hebuilt a prototype of a machine called VIVACE, which stands for vortex-inducedvibration for aquatic clean energy. Think of a square box about the size of abackyard shed that has no front or back wall. Inside it is a cylinder, about afoot in diameter, suspended horizontally on a mechanism that allows it to moveup and down. When placed in a river, water would flow through the box andvortex-induced vibrations would cause the cylinder to bob up and downrepeatedly.7 [e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-7] Bernitsas’ prototype captures thismechanical energy and converts it to a steady supply of direct current. Thecompany placed a small demonstration model of VIVACE in Michigan’s St. ClairRiver in late 2010 and has ambitious plans to launch a commercial product by2013.8 [e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-8]Whether we’re talking about Louis Michaud’s tornadoes, Jay Harman’ssuper-efficient fans and propellers, or Bernitsas’ underwater vibratingcylinders, we keep coming back to swirls, spirals, and vortices. Vortices arealso behind the efficiency of a new wind-turbine blade designed by WhalePowerand based on the research of Frank Fish, a biology professor at West ChesterUniversity in Pennsylvania. Fish marveled at the acrobatic abilities of humpbackwhales, which are efficient underwater hunters capable of making sharp, tightturns, despite being up to 16 meters long and weighing more than five full-grownAfrican elephants. He found that the key to the whale’s agility is its uniquelydesigned flippers, which feature a row of bumps, or tubercles, along theirleading edge that give them a serrated look.Fish and research colleagues from Stanford University and the U.S. Naval Academydiscovered that a humpback whale flipper has 32 percent less drag and 8 percentmore lift compared to a flat-edge flipper. The basic explanation is that thewater is channeled and accelerated as it flows between the tubercles, resultingin a wake of tiny energy-packed vortices that give the flipper lift. This was aremarkable conclusion for Toronto entrepreneur Stephen Dewar, who had beenfollowing Fish’s research. Dewar approached the West Chester researcher andproposed the idea of making blades for wind turbines and ceiling fans, amongother bladed products, which mimic the humpback flipper.9[e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-9] WhalePower was born soon after, and its tubercle bladedesign has already made it into a ceiling fan manufactured by Envira-NorthSystems, the largest supplier of industrial ceiling fans in Canada. Envira-Northsays its whale-inspired fan, as odd-looking as it may be, is at least 20 percentmore efficient at moving air and also dramatically quieter. In its marketingmaterial, the company touts the fan as having benefited from “a million years offield tests.” The tubercle blade design’s quietness alone could prove highlybeneficial for manufacturers of wind turbines, considering noise pollution isone of the most frequent complaints targeted at industrial wind farms. But sofar the Vestas and General Electrics of the world haven’t shown much interestand appear in no rush to change their systems to accommodate a new design.Nature can certainly teach us how to move through water and air moreefficiently, but it can also offer tips on how to manage our consumption ofenergy. REGEN Energy, another Toronto company, has developed a way to controlelectricity use in large buildings by using the same “swarm logic” that bees useto work through problems. An individual bee has a brain the size of a sesameseed and on its own is just another dumb bug. But get a thousand bees together,and they connect as part of a larger, more intelligent collective, one where noparticular bee is calling the shots. This magical approach to collective actionisn’t just a bee trick: ants exhibit this self-organizing behavior as docrickets, and in functioning this way, they demonstrate a remarkable ability tocoordinate their activities. Humans generally operate in the opposite way. We’vegrown accustomed to command-and-control systems, where decision making iscentralized and flows from the top down.The top-down, central command model is inefficient with respect to how devicesin a network consume electricity, thought REGEN founder Mark Kerbel, who in 2005turned to swarm logic as a way to “take the bloat off the grid.” He and hisbusiness partner, Roman Kulyk, invented a proprietary algorithm that theyembedded in tiny wireless controllers attached to fans, air conditioners, pumps,refrigerators, and other building equipment designed to cycle on and off.Building owners often pay a hefty utility premium when their power demandsspike, so it’s in their interest to make sure their appliances don’t all cycleon at the same time. Connecting all appliances to a central system would be tooexpensive and complex. REGEN’s wireless controllers, on the other hand, act likebees. They constantly send simple messages to each other to determine who’s offand who’s on, and they’ll make their own decisions based on the informationreceived. There might be a few dozen controllers in a building working togetheras a single “hive,” and through their frequent exchange of messages they manageto smooth out the electricity load in a building and eliminate costly powerspikes.10 [e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-10]Down the road, Kerbel sees the potential of using his devices to assure theorderly charging of electric cars as major automakers bring more zero-emissionvehicles to market. As Kerbel explained, “As soon as you come home, for example,your plug-in Prius would start talking to other plug-in cars in the neighborhoodand they would all come up with a plan to charge evenly without overwhelming thegrid.” It may prove to be the best way for local utilities to prevent blackoutsin communities where plug-in electric vehicles represent a rising share of thetotal automotive stock.11 [e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-11] But embracing systems basedon swarm logic also requires a leap of faith. It’s not easy giving up controland putting trust in a collective of wireless devices. It may work in nature,but no bee ever got fired from its job by putting its faith in the hive.Janine Benyus is directly involved in a bio-inspired energy venture, OneSunSolar. The stealthy California startup, headed by prominent environmentalist andentrepreneur Paul Hawken, is developing “extremely inexpensive” solar cells thatfunction like the leaf of a plant.12 [e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-12] They don’t usetoxic metals like cadmium or rely on harmful gases, such as silane, duringmanufacturing. The technology mimics photosynthesis and, according to Benyus,will offer an energy return of 200 to 1 and make solar energy more affordablethan coal or nuclear power. “We decided in the scoping phase of our design thatwe should manufacture without heat, that the product would self-assemble, thatit would rely on water-based processes, and it wouldn’t rely on rare Earthmetals,” said Benyus, who is a fan of solar power but is worried about thelandfill legacy current solar PV technologies based on toxic metals andprocesses will leave behind. “We don’t want to have to build a Yucca Mountainfor all our solar waste.”13 [e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-13]Faith in NatureThe above ideas and technologies are truly inspiring, but try walking into aboard meeting or a room full of old-school engineers and mentioning words likebiomimicry, Mother Nature, and even pax, which is the Latin word for peace. Ifheads don’t roll, many eyes certainly will. Disdain for his ideas is exactlywhat Harman often experienced during the early days of PAX Scientific. Herecalled presentations he did in 2002 to a group of about 10 engineers at UnitedTechnologies, a multibillion-dollar industrial giant that makes everything fromair conditioners to helicopters. “At the end of the presentation, the head ofengineering stood up and said, ‘This is bullshit! You’ve been wasting our time,’and he walked out.” Another pitch a couple of years later, this time for theU.S. Office of Naval Research, invited a similar response. “This is nonsense,”said one naval engineer. “Technology shits on nature!” Harman laughed whenrecalling that story, only because he knows that no engineer, no scientist inthe world has yet demonstrated a single situation where human design is moreefficient than the natural designs around them. “Humans don’t even come close,in every single case,” he said. “There’s no scientist on Earth that can explainthe flight efficiency of a single insect.”Attitudes are changing, at least from Harman’s perspective. Around 2006, when AlGore’s award-winning movie An Inconvenient Truth was released, the public andbusinesses began waking up to the threat of climate change and the role beingplayed by fossil-fuel use and wasteful energy practices. Then on July 11, 2008,the price for a barrel of oil hit a record $147.27, a dramatic milestone whenone considers that nine years earlier, oil could be purchased for less than $20a barrel. The cost of doing business was suddenly much more expensive, and whatbecame an energy crisis shined a light on the value of energy efficiency.Consumers, meanwhile, began dumping their gas-guzzling SUVs and opting insteadfor more fuel-efficient cars, or they simply drove less.14[e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-14] Oil prices did plunge back down to $30 a barrel as theglobal economic recession took hold and demand for oil began to plummet, butthis was a temporary retreat. Through 2010, for example, oil hoveredconsistently between $70 and $80 a barrel, two or three times more expensivethan oil prices during the 1990s. For much of 2011, oil has been above $100 abarrel. Surprisingly, these high prices were sustained during a period ofrelatively weak demand, indicating that oil prices, while they may bounce up anddown over the short term, are on an upward trajectory over the long run. Thecost of electricity, as pointed out in chapter 2, has also been rising steeplyover the past decade, with average retail prices in the United States up nearly50 percent. The best way to cope with this reality is to embrace efficiency. “Wemust re-engineer our lives to adapt to a world of growing energy scarcity,”according to economist Jeff Rubin. “And that means learning to live using lessenergy.”15 [e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-15]“Until that energy crisis, you couldn’t give energy efficiency away in theUnited States,” said Harman, adding that companies are now beginning to approachPBX because they know that energy efficiency is strategic to their survival.“Now we’re in a very fortunate position. We’re in the right place at the righttime.” When the recession hit in late 2007, the U.S. government reacted bypassing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a huge economicstimulus package aimed at re-firing the economy. It recognized that investmentsin energy efficiency weren’t just a path to job creation; they would alsoprepare consumers and businesses for higher energy prices and help to boost U.S.industrial productivity. Many billions of dollars were set aside in the stimulusfor energy efficiency initiatives, including $4.5 billion targeting federalgovernment buildings, $600 million aimed at industrial facilities and commercialbuildings, and $300 million in rebates toward the purchase of energy-efficientappliances.Ask U.S. energy secretary Steven Chu why energy efficiency has beenunderappreciated in the past, and he’ll tell you that the market simply failedto value it. Inertia, ignorance, and lack of financing for projects have been abig part of the problem, as has the perception that retrofitting systems andswitching out equipment is too much of a hassle and inconvenience. But in recentyears, the U.S. Department of Energy has made a genuine effort to overcome thesebarriers. Commenting on the importance of energy efficiency, Chu wrote in 2010,“Regardless of what the skeptics may think, there are indeed $20 bills lying onthe ground all around us. We only need the will — and the ways — to pick themup.”16 [e04_TESLA-1.html#x4-16] The commitment from the U.S. government hasstarted to benefit PBX, which through its various spinoff companies has sincereceived millions of dollars in development grants. It may still be an underdogcompared to more established and better understood energy-efficiencytechnologies on the market, but the initial pushback the company experiencedduring its early years has been replaced with some welcome pull. “The governmentis starting to support biomimicry, I’m happy to report,” said Harman. “We hungon by our toenails and fingernails for years. It was a serious struggle if youask any of the folks in our companies, but now we’re actually breathing; thebusinesses are breathing on their own. We’re out of intensive care.”PAX is a family of companies now. Engineering and research activities remainwithin PAX Scientific, but subsidiaries include PAX Streamline (powergeneration, propulsion, heat/air/ventilation systems), PAX Mixer (mixingtechnologies), and PAX Water (systems for handling water and wastewater). Aswell, Paul Hawken runs a completely separate company called PaxFan LLC, which,as part of a licensing arrangement, markets PAX Scientific’s fan technology foruse in computer equipment, automobiles, industrial equipment, and domesticappliances. Though business is better, Harman doesn’t fool himself into thinkingthat his work will get any easier. He knows that for PBX to have the impact heenvisions, and for biomimicry in general to gain mainstream acceptance, it hasto show that changing the way we consume energy by learning from natural formsand processes is, in the end, smart business. “I didn’t leave the fisheries andwildlife department because I wanted to become a corporate person, because Iabsolutely don’t — I’m a bushman,” he told me. “But it became pretty apparent tome that things in this world aren’t going to change unless you can show it’sprofitable to change them. Let’s face it, the world is run by corporations, andcorporations are run by bean counters. So if you’re going to do biomimicry,that’s great, you might have a better solution. But it’s only going to meananything if it’s more profitable.”The road from conception to proof-of-profitability is a long one that, far toooften, ends prematurely and unexpectedly. Breakthrough technologies don’t alwaysbreak through. Money runs out. The will to go on evaporates. Passion, hope, andgood intentions are replaced with cynicism. Having a superior technology alone,as we’ve seen so far, isn’t enough to complete the journey from discovery anddevelopment to demonstration and commercialization. Yet Harman is an example ofhow — despite the pushback, the skepticism, and the hard-held belief by somethat human-conceived technologies “shit on nature” — persistence and patiencecan pay off. His Lily Impeller and other spiral-shaped fans and turbines arebeginning to move more of the planet’s fluids and gases. There may even come atipping point, when the spiral products based on PBX-developed algorithms becomea global standard. But there will be no overnight disruption here, no butterflysuddenly emerging from its chrysalis. Infrastructure is slow to change. So, too,are people and policies.Whatever humanity does, of course, Mother Nature always wins in the end. We arebut a brief entry in her datebook. So if you can’t beat her, join her, or atleast copy her — so say the biomimics who are leading the way. Some innovatorshave a different approach. Why rip off Mother Nature when you can get her to domost of the work for you? That’s what Paul Woods is doing with his Florida-basedstartup Algenol, the subject of the next chapter. Woods is an energy farmer,growing algae that can supply a seemingly endless flow of clean-burning ethanolfuel. Twenty-five years ago, the big oil companies laughed at the idea.

That’s what came to mind while driving down a sunnystretch of road in West Palm Beach, Florida’s self-proclaimed “city ofunsurpassed beauty.” It was June 22, 2010, and while my trip dropped me on theside of Florida left untouched by BP’s rapidly expanding oil slick in the Gulfof Mexico, I knew that other parts of the Sunshine State weren’t so lucky. Stillgushing after two devastating months, the spill that had left black gooeystreaks and oil puddles along the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabamahad begun to tarnish Florida’s northwest Panhandle. Pensacola Beach, usuallybustling with tourists at this time of the year, was uncharacteristicallysedate, a heartbreaking situation in a state already in the grips of a housingcrisis.Minutes from my destination, I turned onto a country road and drove for two orthree kilometers before realizing I had gone too far. Throwing the rental car inreverse, I backed up 50 meters and finally spotted the driveway that took me toan inconspicuously located outdoor test facility operated by Algenol Biofuels.Long, narrow rows of knee-high greenhouse structures stood next to a cluster ofoffice trailers, all of it hidden to the outside world by walls of wind-blownpalm trees. Marine biologist Frank Jochem, director of the five-acre facility,met me at my car and we walked to a trailer where I was introduced to HarlanMiller, a photosynthesis expert who joined the company in 2008. As the three ofus waited for Paul Woods, the Canadian-born founder and chief executive ofAlgenol, the BP oil spill that had occupied my mind during the drive became thetopic of conversation. Jochem, speaking with a German accent, shook his head inobvious disgust. “I don’t know what’s worse, all of the leaked oil or thechemicals they’re using to fight the slick.”Disturbing times, yes, but it makes their work at Algenol that much moremeaningful. Jochem and Miller are part of a growing team that is pushing towarda future where feeding our fuel and chemical addictions doesn’t mean drillingdeeper offshore or relying on sticky bitumen hastily extracted from the tarrysands of northern Alberta. The company has developed and patented a low-costmethod for producing clean-burning ethanol fuel from genetically enhancedblue-green algae, otherwise known as cyanobacteria, a photosynthetic cousin ofalgae that most people would lump into the category of pond scum.1[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-1] That’s right, as strange as it sounds, within the nextdecade the car you drive could be powered by fuel made from the guts, sweat, orexcrement of microscopic organisms that would rather be hanging out in your fishtank. The seed of Algenol’s creation was planted in the early 1980s when Woods,then a 22-year-old undergraduate studying genetics at the University of WesternOntario, learned that some species loosely labelled “microalgae” can naturallyproduce ethanol when subject to certain environmental conditions.2[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-2] Woods wondered if these organisms could be geneticallyengineered to maximize ethanol production and, after convincing himself theycould, he pursued the idea with vigor.Nearly three decades later, what began as a student’s curiosity — a “glorifiedhobby,” as Woods described it — is now a thriving startup with more than 100employees, $100 million plus in financial backing and Fortune 500 partnershipsthat include chemical giant Dow Chemical, industrial gas supplier Linde Group,and oil-refiner Valero Energy. Getting from there to here wasn’t a straightline. There were many bends, bumps, and detours along Wood’s journey, which isstill far from over and not likely to get any smoother. But if Algenol plays itscards right — and like all of the stories in this book that’s a big if — thecompany’s algae-fuel process could help make deep-sea drilling and otherhigh-risk oil projects appear like foolish, uneconomic pursuits.Recycling CO2Let’s begin with a little primer on ethanol. Also known as grain alcohol,ethanol is a renewable fuel that has the potential to displace up to 85 percentof the gasoline used in North American passenger vehicles.3[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-3] It can also replace fossil fuels in the production ofethylene, the basic chemical feedstock for making many types of plastics. Thereason ethanol is “renewable” is because we don’t make it from the skeletonslocked away in Earth’s closet, like fossil fuels made up mostly of deadmicroorganisms that have accumulated over tens of millions of years. Instead,ethanol is made from plants that are part of a natural closed-loop cycle ofgrowth, death, and decomposition on the Earth’s surface. Burning ethanolreleases carbon dioxide but in a carbon-neutral way, meaning the carbon in theCO2 emitted during combustion is re-consumed by the growth of new plant life. Intheory, at least, no new sources of carbon are introduced to the cycle; thecarbon is essentially recycled. The release of CO2 from burning fossil fuelssuch as oil and coal, on the other hand, is carbon-positive because it addscarbon to the atmosphere that was previously held in deep storage within theEarth’s crust. The more we take from underground and burn at the surface, thehigher the concentration of sun-trapping CO2 in the atmosphere and the greaterthe greenhouse-gas effect playing havoc with climate systems. “The bottom lineis that atmospheric carbon dioxide acts as a thermostat in regulating thetemperature of the Earth,” according to NASA climate scientist Andrew Lacis.“The rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide due to human industrialactivity is therefore setting the course for continued global warming.”4[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-4] If we are to keep climate change under control, we mustleave as much of that “ancient” carbon permanently underground. We need to keepthe microscopic skeletons in Earth’s Paleozoic closet locked up, and we need tothrow away the key.But ethanol isn’t without controversy, which mostly concerns how it’s made andwhat’s used to make it. In North America, virtually all of the ethanol that’sproduced is made by fermenting the starches in corn, a crop that is heavilysubsidized and energy-intensive to grow. Most studies suggest that, based on theentire production lifecycle of corn-derived ethanol, the energy required toplant, grow, harvest, transport, and ultimately process the corn into ethanol isalmost as much as the energy you get from the ethanol itself. With such a poorenergy balance, and because the energy inputs are likely to be fossil fuel inorigin, there are serious doubts in the scientific community about theemission-reduction benefits and sustainability of making ethanol from corn.Complicating matters is that corn is food for both humans and animals. As moreof the world’s corn crops are used to make fuel, there is widespread concern,and already plenty of evidence, that food and animal feed prices will rise.5[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-5]Brazilians have been successful at making ethanol from sugarcane, using aprocess that returns several units of energy for every unit of energy put in.Sugarcane, however, is a tropical crop that for obvious reasons isn’t bigbusiness in North America. Besides, dense carbon-rich forests in Brazil arebeing clear-cut to make more room for sugarcane fields. This practice results inmore greenhouse-gas emissions, not less, and defeats the purpose oftransitioning to ethanol. To move beyond these controversies, U.S. and Canadianefforts at improving ethanol’s energy balance have focused largely ontechnologies that can convert a wider range of plant materials — industrial woodand paper waste, forest slash, agricultural residues such as corn stover andwheat straw, and dedicated crops such as switchgrass — into cellulosic ethanol,meaning no more dependence on food crops such as corn and sugarcane. Cellulosegives structure to the cell walls of plants and makes up the majority of allplant matter. Sometimes called roughage, it’s the fiber in plants that we finddifficult to digest. But here’s the thing: cellulose has a lot of sugar lockedup inside it; the challenge is getting it out. So those scientists makingcellulosic ethanol must rely on the use of special enzymes, such as those foundin the guts of termites or used by certain types of fungi, which have an easiertime than humans in liberating the sugars in cellulose. Another approach is touse the right balance of heat, pressure, and oxygen to directly convert or“gasify” the biomass into synthetic gas, which is then fed to special microbesor some other catalyst that turns the gas into liquid ethanol.Methods vary, as do results, but the return on energy is generally better.Making cellulosic ethanol from fast-growing switchgrass, for example, isbelieved to return 3.5 to 7 units of energy for every unit consumed. It can alsolower greenhouse-gas emissions by 94 percent compared to gasoline.6[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-6] The overall goal with cellulosic ethanol is to notcompete with food crops or for land that is ideal for growing food (or which isalready heavily forested). The aim is to produce more fuel using less space,reduce reliance on fresh water, and constantly improve the energy output of thefuel relative to the energy inputs required to make it. The underlying problemis that cellulosic ethanol, compared to corn ethanol, remains expensive to makeeven after many years of research and demonstration. “Today’s cellulosic ethanolis competitive with the petrol it is supposed to displace, but only when theprice of crude oil reaches $120 a barrel,” according to an October 2010 reportin The Economist.That’s where Algenol hopes to demonstrate a significant edge. It claims it canproduce ethanol from blue-green algae that is competitive with oil priced as lowas $30 a barrel and it has an energy return of 5 to 1. And Algenol can do itusing marginal land, dramatically less space, and zero fresh water. All it needsis a steady supply of sunshine, carbon dioxide, and seawater — all of which areplentiful — and some nutrients (phosphorous and nitrogen) for the algae to munchon. Animal manure, for example, is nice snack food for most algae. In return,Algenol says it will produce a steady flow of renewable ethanol fuel for lessthan $1 per gallon that displaces the use of gasoline and petroleum-basedchemicals. As an added bonus, the company says that for every gallon of ethanolit produces, it also produces a gallon of fresh water. That feature alone couldprove compelling for regions, such as Australia or the U.S. Southwest, plaguedby chronic drought, and in many African countries where freshwater supplies arelimited.Refinery in a CellIn his 20s, Paul Woods was so passionate about the algae-to-ethanol concept hehad thought up in university that he spent five years after graduation trying tobuild support for it. He was determined to be an entrepreneur, to not gettrapped in a safe, nine-to-five job like his parents had during his middle-classupbringing. His dad was a computer engineer and his mom an insurance agent, andtheir advice to him emphasized carefulness and caution.7 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-7]His instincts, on the other hand, told him to take risks and trust his gut.Blinded by inspiration, he traveled around Canada during the mid-1980s meetingwith officials from oil and gas companies in a gutsy yet naive effort to winthem over. “Honest to god, I thought the merit of the idea was good enough, wasso fantastic, so simple and elegant, that somebody out there would get it,”Woods, now in his late 40s, recalled while we sat huddled, along with Jochem andMiller, in an office trailer at the West Palm facility. “I went to companiessuch as Suncor, or Sunoco at the time, and everybody hated it. They just hatedit. They thought I was out of my goddamn mind.” At the time, who wouldn’t?Like PAX Scientific’s Jay Harman, Woods isn’t a suit. He showed up for ourmeeting in shorts, sandals, and a collared short-sleeve shirt with a funkypaisley design. With red, nearly shoulder-length hair, he has a laid-backdemeanor that suggests he could have been a party animal in university and maystill be today. He’s professional but in a fun way, stern when he needs to bebut willing (at least in my presence) to chat and joke as if sharing a drinkwith friends. At one point in the conversation, the chatter turns to hockey, asure sign that two Canadians are in the room.Looking back at his early attempts to woo the oil companies, Woods realized histiming couldn’t have been worse. Climate change was non-existent as a politicalissue, peak oil concerns remained at the fringe, and an oil glut following the1970s energy crisis meant the price of crude in the mid-1980s was less than halfof what it cost at the beginning of that decade. He might as well have beenselling tofu to cattle ranchers. Woods turned to fine art through the latterhalf of the ’80s; he owned and operated a small art gallery in his hometown ofMarkham, Ontario, and it was there that he got some sound advice from a supplierand friend. “He said, ‘Look, Paul, if you’re ever going to do this, you can’trely on anyone else. You’re going to have to do it yourself. You’re going tohave to raise your own money.’” Re-energized, Woods discussed his algae fuelidea with family and friends, even customers of his art gallery, and by the late1980s had managed to raise about $200,000 by selling $1,000 shares to 70individual investors.It was shortly afterward that Woods met John Coleman, a plant biologist workingas a professor in the cell and systems biology department at the University ofToronto. “He came to the university and picked me out from a local expert listwe have here,” Coleman remembered. “Paul basically walked into my lab and said,‘Do you think this is a possibility?’ I sat down and thought about it for awhile, and we started coming up with some more ideas.” They knew many types ofblue-green algae (cyanobacteria) made ethanol naturally but not in a way that islinked to photosynthesis. Instead, ethanol is produced in small quantities whenthe cyanobacteria are under stress — starved, without oxygen, and in the dark.The organisms thrive when exposed to sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients,which through photosynthesis produce sugars that are directly metabolized intocarbohydrates, such as glycogen. The trick for Coleman was to get thecyanobacteria to convert sugar into ethanol when they weren’t under stress, tohave them produce ethanol under ideal conditions before the sugars are turnedinto carbohydrates. That meant identifying the enzymes responsible for ethanolproduction and finding a way to switch them on when they would normally be off.The second trick was to significantly boost the quantity of ethanol produced bythe organism. The answer here was to add in some genetic material, an enzyme,from another type of bacteria, such as Zymomonas mobilis, a hardy organismthat’s used instead of yeast to make alcoholic beverages in many countries. Bygenetically modifying the metabolic priorities of cyanobacteria and enhancingthem with the help of a foreign enzyme, Woods and Coleman knew they could turnblue-green algae into highly efficient microscopic refiners of ethanol.What followed through the 1990s was an on-and-off research effort led by Colemanand financed by Woods. Funding for the first two years came from the $200,000that Woods had raised from friends and family, as well as an additional $60,000grant from the Ontario government. After that money ran out, Woods self-financedthe research when he could. And fortunately for him, he could; Woods is the typeof guy who keeps many pokers in the fire. The same year he hooked up withColeman, he also started an energy retail business that sought to take advantageof deregulation in Ontario’s natural gas market. In 1989, he formed Alliance GasManagement, which purchased large quantities of natural gas at a volume discountand resold it to customers through fixed-rate contracts. Reselling energyservices such as natural gas and electricity is common today, but back thenWoods was a pioneer. He was told by energy industry experts at the time that theidea would never work. It didn’t sway him. “I made up brochures on my homecomputer, which was a little Macintosh SE, and a friend of mine printed themout,” he told me. He mass-mailed the brochures and, to his delight, customersbegan signing up. “It worked like a charm.”Eight years later, Alliance Gas had an initial public offering that raised $80million and in 1999 the company, boasting nearly half a million customers andmore than $100 million in revenues, was acquired by Centrica subsidiary DirectEnergy, the largest energy retailer in North America. The same year as thepublic share offering, Woods founded United Gas Management as part of a plan toenter the U.S. market by replicating the success he had in Ontario. “We ended upin nine U.S. jurisdictions,” said Woods, who in just three years grew United Gasto 240,000 customers. He sold his shares in 2000, however, after thecredit-squeezed company ran into financial troubles. A seasoned executive whohad proven his ability to manage and grow companies, Woods was glad to be out.“It was a nasty business,” he recalled. “The utilities just viewed it as usstealing their customers, and they did whatever it took — lied, cheated — to getus out of their territories.” Rather than throw himself back into that ring,Woods, who at 38 years old had accumulated significant wealth, decided to throwhimself into early retirement.Throughout all of this, Coleman kept at his algae-to-ethanol research and Woodscontinued funding it out of pocket, to the tune of about $700,000. The retiredlife was good for Woods, now a resident of West Palm Beach. So good, in fact,that he was in no rush to do anything but enjoy it. “I didn’t work for sixyears,” he told me as we drove for lunch in his white Rolls-Royce. “I just ateand drank and traveled.” As Woods’ biologist-for-hire, Coleman had madesignificant progress with his research, but Woods knew the market wasn’t yetready for an algae-to-ethanol venture. Oil could be purchased for $20 a barrelin 2000, the year of Woods’ retirement, so the economics of making ethanol fromalgae didn’t make sense; pursuing the market at the time would have beensuicidal. The turning point didn’t come until 2005, when oil prices burst wellpast $50 a barrel in the face of rising demand from China and disruptions toU.S. production and refinery capacity in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.Woods’ mother called him one day and, during the conversation, began complainingabout the impact all that expensive oil was having on gasoline prices.8[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-8] This was the tug Woods needed. He was back to businessand better equipped to carry his algae-to-ethanol concept forward.Algae OrgyIt’s worth mentioning that using algae to make biofuels isn’t biomimicry.Scientists aren’t trying to learn or copy from algae. Rather, they’re determinedto get algae to do the work for us by isolating, tuning, and tampering withtheir genetic makeup. Janine Benyus would call it bio-assistance — using,training, or modifying an organism to do what we need it to do. Using eggs toincubate flu vaccines is an example, as is the use of bacteria for theproduction of insulin. You could also call it bio-enslavement. It was in the1930s that the idea of turning algae into microscopic power plants firstcaptured the imagination of scientists. It began with a German researcher namedHans Gaffron, who after fleeing the Nazi party settled into a career at theUniversity of Chicago. There, in 1939, he discovered that algae often producehydrogen, under then-unknown conditions.9 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-9] Back inGermany, scientists were also experimenting during and after World War II on theability of algae to produce oil, which they observed could represent up to 70percent of an organism’s dried weight.10 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-10]Decades passed with only sporadic research until, in 1978, the administration ofU.S. President Jimmy Carter established the Solar Energy Research Institute, thepredecessor to today’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Theinstitute was a response to the 1970s energy crisis and created within it wasthe Aquatic Species Program, which studied the use of algae and other aquaticplants as a resource for energy production. The program’s first four yearsfocused, like Gaffron did 40 years earlier, on hydrogen production, but in 1982research began shifting to the extraction of oils for the purpose of makingbiodiesel. The program was small, had limited funding, and, though itsscientific contributions were substantial, fell victim to the Clintonadministration’s deficit-fighting of the mid-1990s. In 1995, the U.S. Departmentof Energy pulled the plug on algae research and redirected most of whatresources remained toward the study of ethanol, though the focus was oncellulosic ethanol and not the production of ethanol from algae.Researchers involved with the program seemed to lament the decision. They knewthat algae had several advantages over other approaches to biofuel production.Unlike corn, these simple-cell organisms don’t rely on the use of arable landand don’t necessarily use up freshwater resources. Certain strains can thrive inseawater and wastewater. They also reproduce at an astounding rate and arecapable of doubling their mass in just a few hours, blowing away theproductivity of dedicated non-food crops such as switchgrass. Algae areproductive little creatures that, when exposed to sunlight, are unrivaled intheir ability to gobble up carbon dioxide, even relatively dilute sources from afossil-fueled power plant. Theoretically, these high achievers of photosynthesiscan produce 10 to 100 times more oil per hectare than traditional crops such ascorn.11 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-11] Outside the ideal conditions of a governmentlaboratory, however, the potential of economically produced algae oil remained abest guess.“Algae are not nearly as well understood as other organisms that have found arole in today’s biotechnology industry. This is part of what makes our programso valuable,” the NREL scientists wrote in a 1998 review of their work. “Much ofthe work done over the past two decades represents genuine additions to thescientific literature. The limited size of the scientific community involved inthis work also makes it more difficult, and sometimes slower, compared to theprogress seen with more conventional organisms.” They concluded then that thecost of producing biodiesel from algae was still too rich to compete againstoil, and that the ability to make enough of it to have an impact was still inquestion. Still, encouraged by advancements in genetic engineering, thescientists held out hope: “This report should be seen not as an ending, but as abeginning. When the time is right, we fully expected to see renewed interest inalgae as a source of fuels and other chemicals.”12 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-12]They got that last part right. It wasn’t just Paul Woods who anticipated thehat-trick of rising oil prices, rising CO2 emissions, and, thanks to terrorismand political instability, rising concern over energy security. One of the firstcompanies, if not the first, to emerge on the algae-to-biofuel scene wasGreenFuel Technologies, founded in 2001 by a 34-year-old chemical engineer namedIsaac Berzin. GreenFuel was unique, ambitious, and willing to make the kind ofbold claims that create media darlings. Becoming one of the best-fundedcompanies in the game, GreenFuel raised awareness of the potential of algaefuels and fired up the imaginations of scientists, entrepreneurs, and investorswho were watching its story unfold. New algae-fuel ventures with sci-fi soundingnames soon began to sprout. We saw the emergence of San Francisco–based Solazymeand Seambiotic of Israel in 2003, while LiveFuels of San Carlos, California, andSolix Biofuels of Fort Collins, Colorado, made their debuts in 2006, along withAlgenol. San Diego’s Sapphire Energy, which counts billionaire Bill Gates as aninvestor, arrived on the scene in 2007. By the end of 2010, the market wasflooded with startups claiming the ability to solve the world’s energy woes byturning algae, that slimy green stuff that builds up in our fish tanks and dogbowls, into renewable fuel.There was plenty of hype, sure, but collectively there was more talk thanresults. The Energy Biosciences Institute at the University ofCalifornia–Berkeley remarked in an October 2010 report that algae biofuelproduction had failed to move beyond small-scale pilot plants, despite more than100 companies in the United States alone pursuing the market. “The total outputfrom all experimental facilities over the past year was only a few tons ofbiomass and less than 100 gallons of actual algae oil, if that much,” itconcluded.13 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-13] That works out to less than 379 liters,versus the 758 billion liters of transportation fuels produced in the UnitedStates each year. Understandably, there has been some backlash to the hype.Estimating the existence of about 200 algae-energy companies worldwide by theend of 2009, Mother Jones writer Emily Waltz was quick to pounce in a storytitled “Algae Energy Orgy” that labeled the majority of ventures as “scumartists” with empty promises. “Some companies have promised impossible amountsof oil based on speculation, raising millions from unwitting investors,” wroteWaltz, who seemed gleeful in pointing out the demise of GreenFuel in early 2009as the first of many failures to likely come.14 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-14] Indeed,there’s no saying Algenol won’t be one of them.Ethanol EndgameIf out-of-lab production of algae biofuels has been less than stellar, at leastthere have been major advancements around the growing, harvesting, andprocessing of algae for fuel. John Sheehan, a researcher at the University ofMinnesota who was involved with early algae research at NREL, figures thatnearly 12,000 liters of algae oil can be produced for every hectare of land eachyear, compared to just under 4,000 liters of ethanol made from corn and only3,300 liters of cellulosic ethanol from biomass. He estimates that before 2020,the per-hectare output of algae oil could shoot up to 45,000 liters a year,compared to 14,000 for cellulosic ethanol and less than 6,000 for cornethanol.15 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-15] Clearly, the upside sits with the greenslime team. Indeed, a 2011 study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, aU.S. Department of Energy lab, argued that biofuels made from U.S. grown algaecould displace 17 percent of the country’s oil imports — roughly equating to 21billion gallons of algal oil.16 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-16] Personally, I thinkthat’s low-balling its potential.But results depend on methods, and not all algae are created equally. Somegroups (like LiveFuels, Seambiotics, and Sapphire Energy) grow algae in shallowopen ponds that are exposed to the elements; fewer (Innoventures Canada) usecovered ponds where temperature and growing conditions are easier to control,while others (Solix) prefer smaller enclosed spaces called photobioreactors, orPBRs, that are designed to soak up the sun and receive controlled batches ofCO2. Most companies harvest the critters when they’re full grown, crush or grindthem up, and then squeeze out their internal oils; some (Pond Biofuels) arehappy to just dry the algae and burn them directly for their energy, whether toproduce heat or generate electricity. Some companies (LiveFuels) preferautotrophic algae strains that rely on sunlight and carbon dioxide to grow,while others (Solazyme) go with heterotrophic algae that don’t rely onphotosynthesis but instead thrive in the dark when fed a consistent meal ofsugar, wastewater, or some other carbon-rich nutrients.There are trade-offs with each approach. Going with an open pond is far cheaperbut sacrifices the control and high algae productivity one gets with moreexpensive and complicated PBRs. Getting at and extracting algae oil requiresmultiple costly steps but can lead to higher-value fuels and chemicals (andleftover proteins that can be sold as animal feed), while the more direct optionof burning the algae results in lower-value heat energy. Autotrophic algae growby consuming CO2, but their need for sunlight creates geographic limitations andengineering challenges to make sure sun exposure is evenly distributed andmaximized, while heterotrophic algae can be cultivated practically anywhere, indark enclosed tanks 24 hours a day. But absent their ability to consume CO2through photosynthesis, these heterotrophs must be directly fed carbon-basednutrients, such as sugar. This adds cost and eliminates one of the majorattractions of algae fuels, which is the opportunity to recycle carbon fromfossil-fueled power plants. Under all of these scenarios, algae must be bred,genetically manipulated, and ultimately customized to the environment they’replaced in. So where does Algenol fit in?Algae can be broken down into three main components: oil, carbohydrates, andprotein. Algenol is exceptional in the market for its decision to breed algaethat are robust refiners of ethanol, not one time sources of unrefined oil. Isay “exceptional” because there appears to be no other algae companies at thetime of writing that are pursuing the same ethanol endgame, and most majorstudies of algae biofuel — from the early studies at NREL to recent reports fromthe Energy Biosciences Institute — specifically exclude commentary and analysisrelated to ethanol production, which has been largely ignored in favor of algaeoil research. The result is that Algenol has had to do some pioneering researchto get it where it is today, leaving it somewhat alone in the race to bringalgae biofuels to market.algenolimage_1.ai [images/algenolimage_1_fmt.jpeg]algenolimage_2.ai [images/algenolimage_2_fmt.jpeg]Hearing John Coleman talk about it, the focus on ethanol makes a lot of sense.“Ethanol is almost infinitely mobile in an algae cell,” he told me. “Itessentially leaks out of the microorganism after it has been produced in thecell. It evaporates into a gaseous phase.” This is immensely important. Gettingoil from algae usually means constantly growing, fattening up, and harvestingthe organisms, then going through a number of costly steps to extract what isbasically vegetable oil that must be further refined into end products, such asdiesel or jet fuel. As one scientist told me, “We don’t grind up cows to gettheir milk, so why should we do that with algae?” Coleman explained that thesecretion of ethanol out of cyanobacteria cells is comparable to how plantssweat water, a process referred to as transpiration. In both cases, it justhappens — no external energy is required to stimulate or sustain the process.This means the algae are left alone to soak up the sun and CO2 as they produceethanol; they don’t have to be harvested and killed to extract the ethanol as isthe case with most algae-to-oil processes. So while the vast majority of algaebiofuel ventures must manage the constant replenishing and harvesting of theiralgae stock, Algenol keeps its algae alive and productive for as long aspossible, just like dairy cows.In a way, Algenol is akin to a dairy farmer milking a product that can almost begulped down right from the cow’s teat. “More than that,” said Coleman, “we keepour cows hooked up to the milking machine all the time.” The other companies inthe market are more like cattle ranchers that fatten up their livestock for theslaughter, but with the added step that they still need to process and cook the“meat” before it reaches the customer. The numbers that Algenol gives are indeedimpressive and equally unbelievable. Right out of the gate, it’s aiming toachieve ethanol production rates of 56,000 liters per hectare annually. That’sfour times the estimated future performance for cellulosic ethanol and about 10times what corn ethanol is expected to achieve over the coming decade. ButAlgenol doesn’t plan to stop there. It’s eyeing a production milestone of 93,500liters down the road, more than double the volume of fatty oils expected to comefrom competing algae processes.17 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-17] And remember, just asmuch fresh water is produced per hectare as ethanol.But are we at risk of creating algae monsters here? There’s a legitimate concernthat algae that has been genetically engineered and modified in the laboratorycould, when deployed on a large scale, eventually escape its confines and wreakhavoc on natural ecosystems. “Use of genetically modified organisms on thisscale is an untried experience for everyone and may not ultimately be acceptedby the public,” said R. Malcolm Brown Jr., a professor of botany and algaeexpert at the University of Texas.18 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-18] Pictures andvideos of oil-covered birds and dead fish highlight the dangers of oilexploration and development, but the environmental impacts of an algae projectgone wrong could prove just as damaging. If a form of algae has been bred andgenetically enhanced to survive under unnatural conditions, to function inessence as a kind of super algae, what happens if it seeps into the wild?In Algenol’s case, it’s an unlikely scenario, the company says. Thecyanobacteria are designed to turn all sugars into ethanol instead ofcarbohydrates. This modification effectively stunts the organism’s growth,making it a weak specimen in the wild. It’s like breeding a lapdog and thenmaking it compete with a pack of wolves. As one biologist working onoil-producing algae said, “We’re trying to make these guys couch potatoes. Bigand fat and happy.” There has even been talk of designing algae with “suicidegenes” that would cause them to expire after a certain number of days in thewild. Still, public perception remains a powerful barrier to new innovation, andAlgenol and others will have to satisfy lingering concerns. The speed at whichalgae can mutate and the associated risks should not be underestimated.Scum in TrainingPaul Woods and marine biologist Harlan Miller took me for a walkthrough ofAlgenol’s West Palm facility, beginning with the company’s first-generationbioreactors, which look like oversized eavestroughs — white tubs about 19 incheswide and a foot high — lined up in tight rows and covered by a peak of hard,transparent plastic. True to their name, the blue-green algae have a bluish tintand could be seen floating within each bioreactor in a shallow layer ofseawater. A hose, slightly thinner than the garden variety, was connected toeach reactor and supplied the organisms with a steady meal of carbon dioxidegas. A thin wire stretching inside the length of the bioreactors is part of amechanical mixing system that circulates the slimy content, making sure it getsmaximum exposure to sunlight and to the CO2 pumped into the enclosures. “This[setup] is older. We’re still trying to develop a mixing system that isinexpensive to build and operate,” Miller explained. Each bioreactor is alsoequipped with sensors that measure temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels, whichare remotely monitored through a wireless Ethernet network. Miller then drew myattention to the condensation, small droplets of water-diluted ethanol visibleon the inside of the bioreactor cover. As the ethanol vapor escapes from thealgae, these droplets form into bigger droplets and, thanks to gravity,eventually start traveling along the inside of the angled cover down the wallsof the bioreactor. It’s a continuous, low-cost way of collecting the ethanolprior to its purification. No external energy source is required.We moved to another area of the outdoor facility to see a newer generation ofbioreactors. These ones looked dramatically different. Think of a Freezie brandice pop lying on its side but filled with air instead of flavored ice. Nowimagine the soft, clear plastic packaging being nearly four feet wide and 50feet long. Just like in the older bioreactors, the reactor contains a layer ofalgae floating in shallow seawater, which is exposed to sunlight and CO2 Theorganisms produce ethanol that evaporates inside the durable plastic body of thebioreactor and accumulates as condensation on the rounded reactor ceiling. Andagain, gravity carries the droplets of diluted ethanol down the sides of theplastic walls, where they are captured at the base in a simple trap that drainsthe fluid to a central collector.To the average observer (me), the bioreactor appears like nothing more than abig plastic bag. Not quite, said Woods. “That freaking bag does it all.” Theplastic, he told me, is a proprietary material made by Dow Chemical that is usedas a protective cover for photovoltaic cells. Unlike your standard-farepolyethylene, which gets beaten up by the outdoor elements and constant exposureto the sun, Dow’s material is guaranteed for 35 years when applied to solarcells. For Algenol, this high-tech plastic represents about half the cost of itsbioreactor, but the material’s long-term durability is what makes the company’sapproach so feasible. “It’s crucial,” said Woods. “It completely changes theeconomics of how long these algae-ethanol plants last, even if you have to swapout the bag three times over 45 years.” There’s no point, he said, of building amassive algae-ethanol facility if you have to swap out bioreactors every fewyears. Longevity is crucial to the business model, even if there is a slightupfront premium.At the end of my tour, we stopped into a makeshift field lab located beside thebioreactors, what one of Algenol’s technicians called the “grow-op” room. It’sbasically a trailer loaded with shelves of bottled algae culture, each being fedCO2 through an intravenous-like highway of plastic tubes. To simulate sunshine,shelves are backlit by a wall of fluorescent lighting. This is where the algaeat this test facility begin their early growth after being “seeded” in a plasticPetri dish. From the dish, they go to a sterile flask, graduating to a largebottle as water and light levels are stepped up. The batches must be carefullyacclimatized before transitioning to the outdoor bioreactors. “You have to begentle with them at first,” said Woods, picking up a bottle and pointing to thegreen goop inside. “This right here is the most sophisticated algae —ethanol-producing hybrid algae. This is the scale-up just before it goes to thebioreactor. This is the real deal.” No wonder Woods got a tad angry when herealized the door to the trailer wasn’t locked. “Your sole job today is to get ahuge freaking bolt for this door,” he said tersely to one of his staffers. “Idon’t want to see this door open like this again.”I’d be ticked off, too. An incredible amount of work goes into finding the rightalgae for the right job. The pool of specimens is worldwide, and getting toAlgenol’s Florida facility is like qualifying for the algae Olympics. Thousandsof cyanobacteria are collected, analyzed, and put through a screening process atan Algenol biological laboratory in Germany that works in cooperation with thecompany’s lab in Baltimore, Maryland, which claims to have the world’s largestalgae library. There are plenty of blue-green algae to sort through; scientistscredit these single-celled creatures for shouldering up to 30 percent of thephotosynthetic energy production on Earth.19 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-19] Of thethousands of cyanobacteria that have been screened in Germany for their abilityto produce ethanol, less than 100 make it to a lab in Spain that conductsoutdoor testing. Some might look like champions under a microscope but thatdoesn’t mean they can survive in a bioreactor as part of a massive commercialfacility. It also doesn’t guarantee that they can stay on their game after goingthrough genetic enhancements. Of the group that make it to Spain, only the mostelite algae have so far made it to West Palm Beach — less than 10 specimens.“It’s a competition,” said Woods. “Once they come here, we have to train themmore. We have to train them and train ourselves to give them the best chance toproduce [ethanol] over the long term.”Angel from MexicoThe team-building doesn’t stop with the algae. Woods knew back in 2005 that ifhe was going to pursue his algae-to-ethanol dream, he would need to assemble amanagement team that could carry the company through its difficult startupphase. The first recruit was Craig Smith, a veteran executive of the biosciencesindustry and founder of Guilford Pharmaceuticals, a maker of drugs for thetreatment of brain cancer and other diseases. Guilford was sold for $178 millionin 2005, and around the same time Woods attended a neighborhood party at Smith’shouse. “He didn’t even show up for his own party,” Woods recalled. “But I methis wife that night, and the wives and neighbors started talking about what Iwas doing.” A week later, what had become a regular Thursday night party in theneighborhood moved to Woods’ house. Smith and Woods finally met but only forfive minutes. “He told me we’d talk in a week,” said Woods, who at that pointwas wondering what this guy was all about. Was he trying to avoid Woods? “What Ididn’t understand, because I didn’t know Craig, is that because he ran a biotechcompany he had unbelievable access to information. So when I met him a weeklater, he had already read our patents and had investigated a mechanicalengineering paper we’d written. He literally walked into my house and said, ‘I’min.’” Smith is now Algenol’s chief operating officer.[images/152_fmt.jpeg]A casual and cool Paul Woods (left) with Harlan \"Lanny\" Miller at Algenol's WestPalm Beach facility in June 2010. Behind them sit a dozen or so experimentalphotobioreactors, or what Woods calls those \"freaking bags\" that do it all.The third founding partner in Algenol, and the company’s executive vicepresident, is Edward Legere. Another seasoned pharmaceutical executive, Legereis also an expert at helping companies scale up all the way from laboratorytesting to pilot projects to full-blown commercial facilities — a mountainAlgenol has yet to climb. But perhaps the most intriguing co-founder of Algenolis Alejandro González Cimadevilla, a Mexican businessman with family links toGrupo Modelo, the world’s sixth-largest brewery known to most people as themaker of Corona beer. His father, Luis González Diez, is nephew to Grupo Modelofounder Don Pablo Diez and kept a senior role in the company until severaldecades ago when he founded Grupo Gondi, an industrial conglomerate with a focuson paper production, recycling, and packaging. Alejandro González, one of fourbrothers involved in the family business, is vice president of strategicplanning at Gondi and sits on the company’s board. The family still has strongfinancial ties to the brewery.Woods wouldn’t say exactly how he came to know González, a silent partner inAlgenol who generally keeps a low profile as a director of the company. But heheaped praise on González for being an early financial backer and believing inthe concept. “He and I put $70 million of our own money into this, but it waslargely him,” Woods said. “We have no venture capital money. If it hadn’t beenfor him, as a really strong and faithful angel investor, Algenol simply wouldn’texist.” In a way, González is to Woods what J.P. Morgan was to Nikola Tesla — asuper angel who gave him the freedom to push forward on an idea that few otherswere willing to fund.More than that, González became Algenol’s first major customer. According to onereport, González began to look seriously at renewable-energy investments afterhis wife got pregnant and, as most expecting fathers do, he questioned the stateof the world he was leaving behind for his son. Details are sketchy, but itappears González founded a Mexico City–based company named Biofields in 2006 andbegan a search for investments in alternative energy and fuels. It was hisfinancial broker who finally connected González with Woods, and the two menworked out a deal that would help fund development of Algenol while givingBiofields the license to develop a sprawling $850-million algae-to-ethanolproject in the Sonoran Desert in northwest Mexico. That agreement, announced in2008, would see Algenol bioreactors eventually blanketing more than 22,000hectares of Mexican desert — about the area of 40,000 NFL football fields or acity like Boston. The aim is to produce nearly a billion liters of ethanol ayear by 2014, ramping up to nearly four billion liters by 2020.20[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-20] Sounds like a lot, but remember that the United Statesconsumes 522 billion liters of gasoline a year, while U.S. ethanol mandates in2010 targeted annual sales of 49 billion liters.21 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-21] Butit’s a solid start. Construction on a small pilot plant reportedly began in2010. Once Biofield’s facility is in operation, CO2 from a nearby power plantwill be used to feed the algae. González plans to sell his company’s ethanol toPEMEX, Mexico’s state-run oil company, or to export the green fuel toneighboring California.154.jpg [images/154_fmt.jpeg]Paul Woods, standing in the \"grow-op\" room, shows off a bottle of his bestethanol-producing algae.Woods was happy to ride the momentum that González brought to his company, butthe wave got even larger in the summer of 2009 when Algenol announced it waspartnering up with its bioreactor supplier, chemical titan Dow Chemical, tobuild a demonstration plant in Texas. Dow isn’t in the fuel business, but itdoes rely heavily on fossil fuels in the production of ethylene, which is abasic chemical used for making many types of plastic. Like many Fortune 500companies looking to clean up their corporate images, as well as reduce theirreliance on petroleum, Dow saw Algenol’s process as a way to lower its carbonfootprint and have an on-site source of ethanol, which can be used instead ofpetroleum to make ethylene. “Our strategy is to put CO2 to work,” said Dow’sdirector of biosciences Steve Tuttle, when the deal was announced. The originalplan was to deploy 3,100 bioreactors on 24 acres of property at Dow’smanufacturing site in Freeport, Texas. A nearby Dow chemical factory would havefed CO2 to the bioreactors. Months later, Algenol got word that the U.S.Department of Energy was tossing a $25-million grant at the project. But Dow,according to Woods, had trouble convincing regulatory authorities to approve useof the land because of the project’s potential impact on nearby wetlands, so inlate 2010 the companies decided to move construction from Texas to 40 acres ofland next to Algenol’s new headquarters in Lee County, Florida. Not quite whatwas originally envisioned, but Woods called it a more “expeditious route” thatwould result in a slightly larger facility being built by the end of 2011.“Our business really changed a lot since we got Dow as our primary partner,”Woods told me as we drove to a nearby Tex-Mex restaurant for some nachos andbeer. Shortly after the Dow deal was announced, Algenol struck a partnershipwith the Linde Group, the top supplier in the world of industrial processes forhandling gas. Linde is a pro at piping carbon dioxide to and from industrialfacilities. For example, it supplies CO2 through pipelines to more than 500greenhouses that together cover about 1,500 hectares. Algenol and Linde are nowworking together on a similar system to transport CO2-rich emissions from powerplants and other industrial facilities to Algenol’s bioreactors. Another featherin Woods’ cap came in May 2010, when Valero, the largest independent petroleumrefiner and marketer in North America, revealed a development agreement withAlgenol. Valero is also the third-largest ethanol producer in the United States,so it has an interest in any next-generation ethanol technologies that are moresustainable and have a chance of working on a large scale. Valero, mind you, hasinvested in several biofuel startups, including algae-oil company SolixBiofuels, but its link-up with Algenol was further proof that the big,high-profile boys of U.S. industry are taking notice and getting involved.Having Dow, Linde, and Valero on board put Algenol in a different league, evenif it would still remain in training camp for a while. Woods was clearly buoyedby the alliances he had built. “We’ve got the CO2 side covered, we’ve got thechemical side covered, and lastly the fuel side of the business covered,” hesaid. “We have the upstream and the downstream.” When I spoke to Woods again inNovember 2010, he was just about to hop on a plane to meet with one of Europe’slargest energy companies, Spain’s Abengoa Bioenergy, which ended up signing onas a partner. He also met with Saudi Arabia’s state-owned Saudi Aramco, thebiggest oil company in the world. “They’re slow to move, but I’ve been at it fora year,” he said, explaining that Valero was managing the relationship with theSaudis. “Behind the scenes, there’s a lot of working going on with those guys.”But there’s also a lot of skepticism building. “Algenol is a company that hashitherto overpromised and under-delivered,” wrote Joshua Kagan, an energyanalyst with GTM Research in an article that called into question Valero’sinterest in Algenol. He took issue with Paul Woods’ “comical” claim in 2009 thatAlgenol would have 500 million gallons of ethanol in production by 2011. It wasa fair comment. The company, as of summer 2011 and despite the promising earlyannouncement from Biofields, hasn’t come close. The media and industry analystsdon’t take kindly to boasts and exaggeration, and in this case Woods may havebroken the cardinal rule, as many other algae biofuel companies have andcontinue to do. But Kagan kept an open mind, partly because of the blue chippartnerships that Woods has been able to assemble. These relationships, wroteKagan, are hard to ignore — even for the most jaded. “Some might be skepticaland believe that if oil companies invest in advanced biofuels, they are doing soonly to own the most promising technologies so they can later shelve them andkeep consumers dependent on oil. Another perspective is that oil companies arein the ‘liquid fuels’ business, and as long as humans use liquids rather thanelectrons to fill their tanks, the oil companies have a vested interest incontrolling that liquid, whether it is oil, ethanol, or designer gasoline.”22[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-22]The question is whether the major oil companies, the ones that are serious, areserious enough. Take the BP oil spill, a single event with cleanup costsexpected to exceed $40 billion, and that’s excluding those costs that are moredifficult to calculate, such as impact on local hotels, boat charters,restaurants, and other businesses hit hardest by the spill, not to mention thelong-term economic impact on gulf fisheries and tourism.23[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-23] A single event at $40 billion. If companies such as BPare prepared to swallow that kind of risk on oil, why don’t they take the samerisk on clean, more sustainable sources?Tipping the ScalesThe answer may have something to do with scale. If you thought at this pointWoods had defeated the odds and jumped most of the big hurdles necessary todisrupt the energy world, think again. The hardcore R&D may be over, the patentsfiled, the partners lined up, and deployment and demonstration underway.Assuming there are no fatal glitches along the way, the next mammoth challengefor Woods and Algenol’s partners will be commercialization — heavy on capital,light on odds. “Scale is everything in this industry,” said Coleman. Venturecapitalist and biofuel investor Vinod Khosla likes to ask himself this questionbefore throwing money into any energy company: “Can it produce, store, anddisseminate on a wide enough scale to be material in carbon emissionsreduction?” Even better, can it pass the “Chindia test” — can it be embraced inChina and India, the fastest-growing markets and carbon emitters in the world?“If it doesn’t scale, it doesn’t matter,” Khosla has said.24[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-24] It’s not that he doesn’t believe algae-based fuels holdpotential as a solution to climate change and the “war on oil.” It’s just thatan algae company has yet to convince him it can compete with oil on cost andscale.25 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-25]Coleman told me that a key milestone for Algenol will be proving that itsgenetically modified cyanobacteria and its latest bioreactors, which aredesigned to hold 4,500 liters, can operate flawlessly under the same conditionsas a full-scale commercial deployment. After that, said Coleman, building largerfacilities — such as what Biofields envisions — will be like assembling Legoblocks. If one works, 100 will work, and if 100 work, there’s no reason tobelieve 1,000 won’t work — and up from there. That milestone is likely to bereached first in Lee County, Florida, the home of a 40,000-square-foot R&Dfacility that Algenol opened in fall 2010, and where the West Palm facility thatI visited has since moved. This is where Woods and Co. will put theirpre-commercial bioreactors through a barrage of real-world tests. The site,including the relocated pilot site being developed with Dow, will be watchedclosely to see if Algenol has what it takes to go big. I posed the scalequestion to Woods, telling him that some people in the industry say he’ll neverbe able to do this on a scale that matters. “That’s a lie. That’s an absolutelie,” he snapped back, insisting that getting to the scale that Biofieldsenvisions can be done in three or four years. “But if you do nothing, you’renever going to accomplish it in three years. Then it’s just a self-fulfillingprophecy.”In its quest to go big, however, Algenol will also have to prove that it’sbetter than the other little guys out there with similar ambitions — and notjust those trying to squeeze oil from algae. In a world where “carbon” isincreasingly a dirty word, and where a tax or some other price on carbon isconsidered inevitable, there are two options: catch and store the carbon, orcatch and convert that carbon into some other useful product. Algenol says every125 gallons of ethanol it makes consumes a ton of CO2, but it and its algaerivals aren’t the only ones trying to turn sunlight and CO2 into fuel.In 2009, I visited Sandia National Laboratories and had a chance to watchscientist James Miller demonstrate his awkwardly named counter-rotating-ringreceiver reactor recuperator, or the CR5, which uses the intense heat ofconcentrated sunlight to bust up the chemical bonds in water and CO2 so theirmolecules can be reassembled into a synthetic gas and refined into gasoline orjet fuel. It looks like alchemy, but Sandia’s “sunshine to petrol” initiative isthe real deal. “What we’re doing is analogous to photosynthesis,” said Miller.“Algae are a good step in the right direction, but what we’re trying to do isuse more sunlight at higher efficiency.” The potential for some of theseunconventional approaches is so great that the U.S. Department of Energy said in2010 that it would award up to $122 million over five years to a team ofscientists at the California Institute of Technology and Lawrence BerkeleyNational Laboratory that is trying to develop fuels from sunlight and CO2. Thegovernment’s aim is to support the creation of a “direct solar fuels industry”that could help wean the country from oil.26 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-26]Making fuel isn’t the only avenue. A Silicon Valley company called Calera, apotential game-changer in its own right, says it can capture a ton of CO2 forevery two tons of cement it produces. It does this the same way corals andshellfish pull calcium and carbon out of seawater to make their skeletons andshells. Calera has a pilot cement plant in California that is absorbing 86percent of the CO2 from the flue gas of a nearby natural gas–fired powerplant.27 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-27] Renewable fuel or green cement? We could uselots of both.How about baking soda? A Texas company called Skyonic has figured out how tocapture CO2 (and other pollutants) from industrial plant emissions to producebicarbonate, which can be used to make baking soda, detergents, and all sorts ofindustrial products. If carbon prices are high enough, it may also be worthwhileto just shovel the bicarbonate into a big hole in the ground, keeping itpermanently buried and out of the carbon cycle.The power industry’s chosen path is less inspiring and more predictable: hugevolumes of CO2 from coal plant emissions are captured and pumped underground forpermanent storage, either in depleted oil and gas wells or deep saline aquifers.The idea with so-called carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is to treat CO2as dirt that should be swept under the rug — or as I like to say, to hide ourpeas in our potatoes. Let’s ignore the fact that it’s costly to do it and wouldrequire the development of a global network of CO2 pipeline and storageinfrastructure on par with what we already have for natural gas and oil. Oneproblem with CCS is that it is energy intensive, meaning a power plant has toburn more fuel — and emit more CO2 — to run the equipment and chemical processesrequired to capture those same emissions, concentrate them, compress them, pumpthem through a pipeline, and inject them underground. (Algenol, by comparison,uses free sunlight to power its CO2 capture and it doesn’t have to concentrateits CO2 or compress it. Everything in its process is done under relatively lowpressure, and gravity drives its ethanol collection.) Then, once the CO2 isforced underground, we cross our fingers and hope nothing leaks into thesurrounding environment, where it can contaminate drinking water or furtheracidify the ocean. Sudden leaks on a large enough scale, possibly triggered byan earthquake, could potentially suffocate animals (including humans) in anaffected area. Small but continuous leaks would also undermine the sole purposeof CCS, and there appears to be no way to indefinitely guarantee such leakswon’t occur, or that they could even be detected. The risks, in the form ofliability alone, are enormous.“Good luck.” That’s what Microsoft founder and billionaire Bill Gates, now anactive investor in energy technologies, once said when talking about the futureprospect of CCS, a technology that he actually supports. “No private enterprisecould take on the risk, and no government has stepped up.”28[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-28] Yet this is the approach the power industry continuesto embrace. Costs vary for the technology, but estimates range from $80 to $120for every ton of CO2 captured and stored underground. Ask Paul Woods about CCS,and he can’t help but rip the idea apart. “You’re basically just taking $100bills and shoving them in a hole in the ground,” he told me. “If you give me $20or $40, I’ll take your CO2 and give you a product for it.” But that kind ofreasoning doesn’t yet resonate with the industry. Again, just as BP is willingto push the limits of drilling technology, go to more dangerous lengths to findand pump oil, and risk having to pay billions of dollars in damage-control costsin its continuing hunt for an increasingly hard-to-find resource, the world’spower plant operators are willing to take the risks that come with blanketingthe planet with CO2 pipelines and pumping the world’s most notorious greenhousegas out of sight, but not necessarily out of the equation. For them it’s aboutsurvival, about protecting an infrastructure that has kept them rich and hasgrown so large that changing direction, at least in any meaningful way, is notan option. Simply put, they have scale, they have control, and they don’t wantto lose it. The irony is thick, as these are the same companies that dismissalternative energy technologies as too risky, prohibitively expensive, andimpossible to scale, as if what they themselves are pursuing is a walk in thepark. What’s possible or not is clearly in the eye of the beholder.Scrappy UnderdogStill, there have been some eye openers. On July 14, 2009, the world’s largestpublicly traded oil company, ExxonMobil, said it planned to invest $600 millionover several years in algae biofuel research and development. Of that, itcommitted roughly half to genome pioneer Craig Venter and the company he foundedin 2005, Synthetic Genomics, which is genetically engineering photosyntheticalgae that can secrete their oils, similar to how Algenol’s cyanobacterianaturally produce and emit ethanol. Venter has delivered before. He and hisprivately funded team of researchers were the first to sequence the entire humangenome, a historic scientific feat they announced in 2000. They did it in lessthan a year and three years ahead of the public Human Genome Project. KeithJohnson, an environmental reporter with the Wall Street Journal, wrote that thepartnership between Exxon and Venter “could mark a coming age of alternativefuels.”29 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-29] Indeed, only a few years earlier Exxon wasone of the most vocal skeptics of human-caused climate change. Suddenly, it wasleading the charge and putting algae on the front lines.30[e05_TESLA-1.html#x5-30] If concern over climate change wasn’t a motivation,then certainly the coming impact of peak oil was forcing Exxon to pursuerenewable alternatives.The Exxon-Venter alliance has raised the bar for algae ventures focused on oil.No longer is it enough to just extract oil from algae; the approach du jour isto get the algae to hand it over on its own, cutting out the need to harvest,kill, grind, and squeeze. The new buzz term is to produce oil as a “drop-insolution” — a product that integrates seamlessly with existing oilinfrastructure without the need for pre-treatment or refining (what I called a“shoehorn solution” in chapter 4). Already, there are a handful of otherventures pursuing this Holy Grail of biofuels, including Joule Unlimited, alow-profile company from Massachusetts, which has genetically engineeredcyanobacteria that reportedly secretes both oil and ethanol. The competition isgood and will force Algenol to up its game. Already, Woods is exploring ways toproduce isobutanol (isobutyl alcohol), which packs a greater energy punch thanethanol, can be blended with gasoline, and is a building-block chemical for theproduction of jet and diesel fuels. He said his cyanobacteria can certainlyproduce the fuel. “We’re just trying to figure out how to economically get theisobutanol out of the culture.”I asked him about the Exxon-Venter deal, and he downplayed the relationship.Woods has a sense of what’s going on at Exxon, as several of his own employeeswere recruited from the oil giant. “The company talks a game about CO2mitigation, but if you look at the $300 million they announced for SyntheticGenomics, the actual funding was below $20 million.” Exxon, in fact, did makeclear certain strict milestones must be met before the next round of cash isreleased. “The problem with that research program is it’s designed to take along time,” said Woods. “If you want something done more quickly and effectivelike Dow, Linde, and Valero do, then you go a different route; you go withAlgenol.”Bold talk from a man on the front lines who must know better than anyone elsethat few will be left standing after the field is rushed. It’s the nature of thegame. Woods is an underdog, a scrappy one at that, but you have to be scrappy tostay alive for the next fight and the one after that. He’s also in a rush to getout of the lab, to escape the endless calls for more R&D, to get out there andactually do something that can start having an impact. And he challenges anyonewho has doubts about Algenol’s technology and approach to do their duediligence, just as Dow, Linde, and Valero have. “When you examine technologyvery carefully, you can easily whittle down the bullshit from what’s real. Ifyou really want to examine things, to separate the wheat from the chaff, youcan.” By 2020, perhaps earlier, we’ll be able to look back at Algenol anddetermine whether it has been a success or failure. Either way, it’s aspectacular attempt that’s contributing to the advancement of a more sustainableworld. “If you do nothing, of course you’re not going to get there,” said Woods.Algenol has proven adept at building friendly alliances, something Dick Weir andhis mysterious company EEStor is less accomplished at. Even so, as you’ll findout in the next chapter, Weir has both believers and skeptics watching hiscompany’s every move. EEStor says it has developed an energy-storage device thatcould end the reign of gas-powered vehicles and usher in the dominance ofrenewable energy. But as astrophysicist Carl Sagan once said, “Extraordinaryclaims require extraordinary evidence.”Notes:1 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5x1] Cyanobacteria are not algae in the narrow sense: theyare non-plant microorganisms capable, like true algae, of photosynthesizingsunlight. But they are regularly thrown under the algae umbrella. For thisreason, and for the purposes of this chapter, cyanobacteria and algae will beused interchangeably.2 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5x2] For the remainder of this chapter, all uses of “algae”refer to microalgae, as opposed to macroalgae (which is seaweed).3 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5x3] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ruled inOctober 2010 that newer vehicles can operate on a maximum 15 percent mixture ofethanol in gasoline. Prior to that, the blend limit was 10 percent. To get up to85 percent a “flex-fuel” vehicle or retrofit is required, but this now costsless than $300 per vehicle.4 [e05_TESLA-1.html#x5x4] Andrew Lacis, “CO2: The Thermostat That ControlsEarth’s Temperature,” Goddard Institute for Space Studies website.

January 11, 2007."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6Secrecy in Cedar ParkRaising the Bar on Energy Storage“A great idea isn’t the next guy doing a lithium-ion battery, almost certainly.”— Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla“EEStor disrupts so many different sectors — it’s the end of fossil fuels.”— Ian Clifford, founder, ZENN Motor Co.Former IBM engineer Richard Dean Weir doesn’t want attention. “I don’t want tobe a celebrity,” he told me. “I really don’t need that.” He generally loathesthe media. His company EEStor, founded in 2001, doesn’t have a corporate website(at the time of writing), and it rarely puts out a press release. What wordsWeir does use are few and abrupt. I first reached out to him in February 2006 toresearch a newspaper feature; the email he sent back was dismissive and terse.“EEStor would like to have you and your paper not publish any articles about ourcompany.” He went further, telling me I wasn’t authorized to publish hisdismissive response. That was a career first. But when someone tries to playhard to get, people naturally try to get him. Despite Weir’s desire to stay outof the spotlight, EEStor has developed a cult-like following on the Internet,where the rumor mill swirls and skeptics and believers trade barbs as they waitfor Weir to deliver on a promise that’s supposed to change the world as we knowit. Those who track and document the company even call themselves EEStorians.So what explains this unusual fascination normally reserved for the latesti-gadgets from Apple or new video game releases? In two words: energy storage, atechnology we take for granted and on which we increasingly depend. What Richard“Dick” Weir is working on, however, is not your run-of-the-mill Duracellbattery, or even the more advanced lithium-ion batteries that are powering mostof the plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles coming soon to a dealership nearyou. EEStor says it has developed a new type of energy storage device, one basedon research from the Reagan-era “Star Wars” program, which could usher in afuture of low-cost electric cars capable of traveling more than 400 kilometerson a single five-minute charge. That alone is jaw-dropping, but Weir alsoinsists his electrical energy storage unit, or EESU, would last longer than thelife of any vehicle it powered. For that matter, it would outlast any laptop,smart phone, e-reader, electric scooter, cordless tool — any portable consumerproduct that runs on electricity or, as you’ll see, any military weapon. Imaginehaving an iPhone that only needs charging once every two or three months.According to one of EEStor’s patents, this remarkable storage device would havethe added benefit of not being “explosive, corrosive, or hazardous,” which can’tbe said for most other battery chemistries. “You could drive a metal stakethrough it,” Weir said in one of his rare interviews. “It will be the safestbattery the world has ever seen.”But just as disruptive would be its application to renewable energy, such aswind and solar, which has historically been limited because of its inability togenerate power when factories, businesses, and homeowners always need it. Thereexist today some forms of large-scale energy storage, such as pumped storage ofwater or compressed-air storage, but these are expensive and only possible incertain locations and geographies. EEStor’s technology would bust open themarket by offering a way, not limited by location, to affordably store hugequantities of electricity from wind turbines that don’t spin all the time orsolar panels that are at the mercy of thick clouds and setting suns. Massivestorage facilities using EEStor technology could then dispatch thatinexhaustible, emission-free power the same way we do now with coal and naturalgas power plants. Low-cost energy storage along the lines of what EEStorenvisions could level the playing field, once and for all, between renewablesand fossil fuels, dramatically changing the way we design electricity systemsand how we power transportation. It would be a true breakthrough, that elusive“game-changing” technology that whips up both optimism and skepticism. Such aform of cheap energy storage would permit us to power more of the planet withclean, renewable energy — instead of coal and natural gas — that in turn wouldbe used to charge up electric cars that have range and performance to rivalvehicles fueled by gasoline and diesel, which would eventually become dinosaursof a dirty era. The result is a virtuous cycle of clean energy that makes itpossible for world economies to phase out, over time, the heat-trapping,air-polluting fossil fuels they have come to depend on. “Honestly, I don’t knowif EEStor has solved it or not,” said Elon Musk, co-founder and chief executiveof electric-car maverick Tesla Motors. “I’ve heard people say it’s justbullshit, and others say it’s a big breakthrough. Until you see something on theroad, objectively, it’s hard to say what’s true.” So we impatiently wait, somemore doubtful than others but all, whether they admit it or not, carrying a seedof hope.EEStor first landed on my radar in late 2005 when I stumbled upon a short newsstory published by Businessweek. It mentioned that the Texas-based company hadraised $3 million as part of a small financing deal led by famed venture-capitalfirm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. EEStor, according to the article, claimedto make a battery “at half the cost per kilowatt-hour and one-tenth the weightof lead-acid batteries.”1 [e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-1] Not much information to go onat the time, but enough to get the imagination charged up. General Motors’short-lived EV1 electric car, produced during the late 1990s and more recentlyprofiled in the critically acclaimed documentary Who Killed the Electric Car?,ran on 26 lead-acid batteries that together weighed about 1,300 pounds, or morethan 40 percent of the vehicle’s weight. At best, it could travel 100 miles on asingle charge. EEStor’s energy-storage technology, by comparison, would costhalf as much and could technically, on a weight-for-weight basis, give the EV1 asingle-charge range of 1,000 miles.2 [e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-2] One could easilydismiss such a claim as wishful thinking, but it was the connection with Kleinerthat leant it credence. The venture capital firm was legendary in Silicon Valleycircles, having made early and stunningly successful bets on Google, Amazon, andothers that are now giants of the Internet ecosystem. From the outside lookingin, Kleiner’s involvement with EEStor was a credible and curious endorsement.The timing was also ideal. In 2005, the public had grown tired of thenever-ending promises of hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Electric cars —from Toyota’s hybrid-electric Prius to Tesla Motors’ planned all-electricRoadster — were beginning to capture more headlines and investment dollars.Energy security was top of mind in a post-9/11 world and climate change was setto become a mainstream concern in 2006 with Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth.Meanwhile, organizations such as the California Cars Initiative (CalCars) sawthe re-emergence of the electric car as inevitable and pushed hard to have majorautomakers begin development of plug-in models that ran mostly (or exclusively)on juice from a wall socket. The established automakers resisted at first, butmost of them eventually fell in line, putting unprecedented focus on the need todevelop better battery technologies. Mysterious EEStor, whether one took itseriously or not, stood out by every measure.The Pre-EEStorySo who is this Dick Weir fellow, anyway? Details of his early professional lifeare sketchy, feeding the mystery and skepticism around EEStor. Those who knowWeir say he grew up in Montana and as a young adult enroled with the U.S. MarineCorps, which had him flying fighter jets off aircraft carriers in northern Japanduring the early 1960s, part of routine patrols that kept an eye on Soviet navalactivity around the port of Vladivostok. Later that decade, Weir got a degree inelectrical engineering from California State Polytechnic College in Pomona.During the 1970s and 1980s, he worked for a variety of companies in computing,including IBM, Burroughs, Xerox-PARC, and Micropolis. At these companies, hedeveloped an expertise in disk-drive technology and integrated circuitfabrication, while also learning the importance of materials science in theiradvancement. Weir shifted gears somewhat in the 1980s after President RonaldReagan launched his Strategic Defense Initiative (“Star Wars”). At some point,Weir began working in the space and technology division of military contractorTRW, which was developing laser-based defense systems for the Star Wars program.The exact nature of this work is unclear, but in a confidential investorinterview that leaked onto the Internet in July 2009, Weir, talking about theorigins of EEStor’s technology, said he “invented a chip that went into deepspace” and, under contract with the Central Intelligence Agency, invented anultra high-frequency channel.3 [e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-3] “I’ll be very blunt,” onebusiness source close to Weir later told me. “I think Dick was working on adeep-space channel that could control satellites that were designed to shootdown missiles, but it needed to be powered.” That power, in deep space, wouldhave to come from an extremely advanced energy storage device.It was during this time that Weir met Carl Nelson, the other, even moreenigmatic founder of EEStor. Nelson was educated and worked for many years atthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied under Arthur vonHippel, a pioneer in molecular engineering and a world-renowned expert inadvanced materials. Nelson himself became an expert in crystallography (thestudy of how atoms are arranged into solids) and the development of ceramicpowders that can be used in a range of high-tech products. These included“dielectric” materials that control the flow of electrons in an electric field.Nelson was a smart cookie, and he began working in close collaboration with DickWeir at TRW.Shortly after the end of the Cold War, and under the order of incoming PresidentBill Clinton, the space-based Star Wars program envisioned by Reagan — and longprotested by the Soviet Union — began to shift focus to a ground-based missiledefense system that was more regional in dimension and less threatening inscope. Military funding for the type of expensive work Weir and Nelson weredoing began to dry up, and they never got around to completing the power storagepart of their work. “The Russians threw in the towel and we [the U.S.] didn’tneed it any longer,” Weir said in the leaked interview. “So I shelved it andwent into doing some work for the disk-drive industry.” Weir and Nelson knew thepath they needed to pursue on energy storage, but getting on track withoutmilitary support proved challenging. Some of the high-voltage semiconductorcircuitry needed to build their envisioned device, for example, wasprohibitively expensive at the time.The computing revolution was well underway, and the Internet, including this newinvention called the World Wide Web, was just beginning to grip the public’simagination. So Weir and Nelson shifted their focus to what they both knew well.They founded Tulip Memory Systems, a disk-drive storage company in Fremont,California, and through the early 1990s began filing patents on a“groundbreaking” magnetic disk-drive storage technology they had developed. Theycame up with a way to manufacture a memory-storage disk with a thin-film surfaceof titanium alloys, one that would be capable of storing far more data thanindustry-standard aluminum disks at the time. Micropolis, one of Weir’s formeremployers, helped fund their first few years of research and development.In 1996, however, Tulip began to wilt. Micropolis ran into its own financialtroubles, and by the end of 1996 the funding lifeline for Tulip was cut off. Itwas around then that Weir and Nelson met Gary Hultquist, a California investorand entrepreneur who was intrigued by their work. Hultquist led a group of angelinvestors who breathed new life into Tulip with a $2.25 million investment. Healso arranged $5 million in additional investment from Titanium Metals, theworld’s largest supplier of titanium. As part of the deal, they changed Tulip’sname to the more high-tech-sounding Titanium X. “I thought at this point we hadthe world by the tail,” recalled Hultquist, explaining that disk-drive giantSeagate Technology had signaled that they would embrace Titanium X’s technologyif strict specifications could be met. “We kept improving it each year, and wefinally did meet the standards given to us by Seagate.” But it took longer thanexpected, and Seagate had a change of heart during a pivotal meeting in 2000.“They told us they wouldn’t end up switching to titanium disks because switchingcosts through the supply chain would be too great, and titanium prices were toovolatile.” Weir, Nelson, and Hultquist were stunned that Seagate had shut thedoor and, as a result of this unexpected blow, the decision was made to shutterTitanium’s business. “When I left them, they had no money and our project hadbeen a failure,” said Hultquist, now a principal at investment firm NewCapPartners in San Francisco.About six months later, Weir and Nelson began filing energy-storage patentsunder the name EEStor. I asked Hultquist what the two men were like, bothpersonally and professionally. “There was a lot of great engineering done byDick and Carl, and while they missed several deadlines they eventuallyperformed,” he told me. He also painted a picture of Weir that was in starkcontrast to Nelson. Both men were in their late 50s or early 60s at the time.Weir, a balding, paunchy fellow about six feet tall, was an abrupt, dogmatic,and closed individual who didn’t work well with outsiders but was full ofenergy. “He looks people directly in the eyes,” said Hultquist. “He always toldme without question we would get things done. You can suggest things to him, butyou can’t tell him to do something. Dick does things his way.” Nelson, on theother hand, was shy and spoke mostly through Weir. He was a tall, gaunt, andsickly looking chap, described by one source as a “scary professor” who didlittle else but work. “I had an office about 20 or 30 feet from Carl,” saidHultquist. “I would see him all the time, but he was always at his desk.” In away, Weir was the yin to Nelson’s yang.Battery BottleneckWhat Weir and Nelson described in their first round of EEStor patents wasn’t anew type of battery per se. In fact, they claimed it as a “replacement ofelectrochemical batteries” that are in popular use today. A battery is basicallya device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. Take two piecesof metal — zinc and copper, for instance — and separate them by a mixture ofsalt and water. This “salt bridge” in the middle is called the electrolyte; thezinc is a positive electrode and the copper a negative electrode. Theelectrolyte contains what are called free-flowing ions, and when you attach aload, such as a flashlight bulb, to the end of each electrode, the ions in theelectrolyte will flow from the zinc to the copper. That flow of ions produces adirect current of electricity. This is basically what Italian physicistAlessandro Volta demonstrated for the first time back in 1800, and while thereare many flavors of battery chemistries today, the basic principle — that of anelectrochemical reaction between two electrodes — still holds. For example,lead-acid batteries first invented in 1869 still use lead-based electrodesseparated by an electrolyte of sulphuric acid; newer lithium-ion batteries uselithium-based electrodes separated by an electrolyte made up of lithium salts.Batteries are everywhere, from the throwaway “primary” batteries used inflashlights and wristwatches to the rechargeable “secondary” batteries used intraditional cars (lead-acid), hybrid-electric vehicles such as the Toyota Prius(nickel-metal hydride), and laptop computers and smart phones (lithium-ion).They can be designed to store small or large amounts of energy, but they allrelease that energy in a slow, steady current. In many instances, the limitationof battery technology at a given point in time has been a bottleneck to otherinnovations. Take smart phones. Each new added feature — color screen, touchscreen, digital camera, MP3 player, Wi-Fi, and so on — consumes energy. At thesame time, consumers demand smaller gadgets that can operate longer betweencharges. Phone makers can make their device more energy-efficient, but there isalso immense pressure on battery makers to develop smaller, lighter, and cheaperbatteries that hold more energy. It’s been a tall order for companies such asApple or Research In Motion, as they try to keep one step ahead of each other inthe smart phone wars.The same battery bottleneck has held back development of electric cars. Thechallenge has been to find a battery chemistry that can take up the least amountof space, weigh as little as possible, power a car for several hundredkilometers, and be affordable enough for an electric vehicle to be competitivelypriced with its gas-powered equivalent. One key metric is specific energy, whichis the amount of energy (watt-hours) a battery can supply per kilogram of itsweight. Lithium-ion batteries, with a specific energy of between 80 to 150watt-hours per kilogram, have so far been anointed the battery chemistry ofchoice for electric cars. By comparison, the best lead-acid batteries have aspecific energy of only 32 watt-hours per kilogram. Still, despite theirsuperior performance, the best lithium-ion batteries today still fall well shortof where we’d like to be. “A number of incremental improvements are underway,but they will at best offer two-times improvement in price performance,” wroteventure capitalist Vinod Khosla in one of his many online missives on new energytechnologies. “They represent improvements, but not radical changes, totechniques used in batteries for consumer electronics. We cannot expectsignificant increases in performance absent fundamentally new approaches.”4[e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-4]Actually, it wouldn’t be so bad if you could recharge a lithium-ion battery inthe same time it would take to fill up your car with gasoline. But we can’t, atleast not yet. There are expensive quick-charge technologies out there, but eventhey still require 15 to 30 minutes to perform a decent recharge. Modernconsumers are creatures that demand instant gratification. We live in a cultureof impatience. We hate to wait. We want it now. We’ll do it if we have to, butmost of us would rather not have to wait several hours to recharge a device orvehicle. Another strike against batteries is that they tend to be made of toxic,corrosive, flammable, and/or explosive materials that are difficult to recycleand risk leaving us a shameful landfill legacy. They also degrade over time witheach recharge cycle, meaning they often expire well before the products they aredesigned to power.There’s another type of technology that gets around many of these limitations:the ultracapacitor. An “ultracap” is basically two metal plates of oppositecharge that are separated by an insulator, or what’s also referred to as adielectric. Think of a peanut butter sandwich, where the two pieces of bread arethe metal plates and the peanut butter is the insulator. If you apply voltage tothe sandwich, the peanut butter prevents the current from flowing through, soinstead electrons accumulate on the bread and create an electric field acrossthe peanut butter. The Earth, in a way, is part of one big spherical capacitor.The ionosphere is one plate and the surface of the Earth is the other, with morethan a hundred kilometers of lower atmosphere in between acting as thedielectric. Solar wind from the sun constantly fills the ionosphere withpositively charged particles, and when that charge builds up too much, theelectric field in the atmosphere reaches a breaking point and — bang! — lightingstrikes. William Tahil, research director with Meridian International Research,has been exploring ways of economically tapping into this “atmosphericelectricity” as a new source of clean energy since 1997.5[e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-5]The electric field that builds up inside an ultracapacitor is also similar tothe electric field that builds up on your body (one plate) when you walk acrossa dry carpet in socks. And, similar to how one can release a sudden shock whenreaching through the air (the dielectric) and touching a doorknob (the secondplate), so too can an ultracapacitor dispatch a powerful burst of energy. Nochemical reactions take place. No toxic or corrosive materials are used.Ultracapacitors, unlike batteries, can also be instantly charged, discharged,and recharged almost infinitely. The problem is that ultracapacitors don’t storemuch energy. They pack a powerful one-time punch, but on a watt-hour perkilogram basis, lithium-ion batteries hold 100 times more specific energy.To get around the limitations of batteries and ultracapacitors, Weir and Nelsonsay they have developed a “ceramic battery” that is a hybrid of a battery andultracapacitor, combining and enhancing the best features of both. At its coreis a cell of two aluminum plates that sandwich a dielectric of“composition-modified barium titanate,” which is a fancy way of saying a whiteceramic powder with an amazing ability to hold an electric field. Each cell isabout the size of a microchip and one-fifth the thickness of a human hair. Onehundred cells are packed tightly into an element, and 10 elements are tightlypacked to form a component. An EEStor ceramic battery that could power anelectric car would contain more than 30,000 components or more than 30 millioncells. Pound for pound, it would store twice the energy of the lithium-iontechnology used in the Tesla Roadster, but Weir and Nelson have said they couldmanufacture the device at one-fifth the cost, maybe less. The device wouldproduce high voltages, but power electronics would be used to match up withcertain products that operate at lower voltages. “It’s really tuned to theelectronics we attach to it,” Weir once told me. “We can go all the way up —from pacemakers to locomotives to direct-energy weapons.”6[e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-6] The power electronics would also take what in anultracapacitor is usually a quick release of energy and reduce it to the kind ofsteady flow of current we get from batteries. If it all works — and there aremany industry experts who believe Weir and Nelson will never get it right — thisis the kind of “fundamentally new approach” that Khosla thinks is needed todramatically open up the battery bottleneck.High-Risk BetHow much of this ceramic battery technology is based on Weir and Nelson’stop-secret work for TRW, or materials and thin-film manufacturing processesdeveloped at Titanium X? Only they know. But once the core patents were filed,Weir began hunting around for investors in 2002. Sources say Weir approachedsome of the big automakers and was promptly rebuffed. They had little interestin electric cars at the time, let alone a vehicle powered by a little-understoodenergy storage technology with no track record. They’d rather watch and wait,then pounce later if necessary. It was around the same time that a smallToronto-based company called Feel Good Cars was making its U.S. debut at theElectric Transportation Industry Conference in Florida. Feel Good Cars launcheda low-speed electric vehicle called ZENN, which stood for “zero emissions, nonoise.” In many ways, it was a pimped-out golf cart. It ran on lead-acid batterypower but was fully enclosed, heated, and came with air conditioning. It had allthe necessary lights and safety features as well as power windows, keylessentry, and a slick stereo system — a perfect ride within a gated community. Weirnoticed the media exposure Feel Good Cars was getting, so in late 2002 hereached out to Ian Clifford, the co-founder and at the time chief executive ofthis small but seemingly innovative electric-car venture.“We talked quite a bit by phone, and eventually we met in Montreal,” saidClifford, a former photographer and Internet marketing entrepreneur who has apersonal love of electric vehicles. Clifford was intrigued by the potential ofWeir’s work and spent much of 2003 leading due diligence on EEStor and itsenergy storage claims. Interestingly, the references Weir provided to Cliffordincluded contacts at NASA and military contractors Lockheed Martin and GeneralDynamics, indicating that Weir and Nelson were still working on U.S. defensecontracts. Indeed, in one interview, Weir conceded to me that EEStor had beenworking closely with Lockheed Martin since 2001. Clifford knew that EEStor was ahigh-risk bet, but he also understood the widespread implications if the companydelivered. Partnering with EEStor would be a leap of faith, but Clifford happilytook the plunge. Feel Good Cars struck a $2.5 million licensing agreement withEEStor in 2004 that gave the Canadian company exclusive worldwide rights topurchase EEStor’s super battery for use in compact and subcompact cars — prettymuch any vehicle weighing up to 1,200 kilograms, excluding small SUVs and pickuptrucks. “Nobody was talking about electric cars then,” Clifford recalled onemorning over breakfast at a Toronto diner. “There’s a time and a place foreverything, and we happened to be in the right place at the right time.” A lateramendment to their agreement increased Feel Good Cars’ market to any car size upto 1,400 kilograms. The $2.5 million was a small price to pay for the potential,however fragile the reality, to dominate a multibillion-dollar vehicle marketdown the road.Weir’s quest for funding didn’t stop there. Through the high-tech community inCalifornia, he managed to link up with Ed Beardsworth, who made a living at thetime scouring national research labs for emerging technologies that his clients,a group of large power companies, might find a threat or opportunity.Beardsworth was essentially a technology scout for utilities. He knew the energysector intimately and reported back his findings through his self-publishednewsletter Utility Federal Technology Opportunities, or UFTO. “Once I got toknow Dick and his story, he authorized me to connect him with investors,”explained Beardsworth, who was based in Silicon Valley and very much pluggedinto the local venture capital scene. Introductions were made with a number ofventure capital firms, including Kleiner Perkins, which at the time had amandate to invest more aggressively in “green technology” startups. Kleiner wascaptured by EEStor’s story and began its normal due diligence, which included acall to Weir’s former Titanium X investor Gary Hultquist, who told them “to notunderestimate Dick and Carl, because these guys were very good at what theydid.” Like Feel Good Cars before them, the high-profile venture capital firmdecided in 2005 to take the plunge and led a $3-million investment in EEStorthat gave it a 32 percent stake in the company. To keep tabs on Weir’s progress,Kleiner placed two big guns on EEStor’s board: private-equity investor MortonTopfer, a veteran high-tech executive who was a former vice chairman of DellComputer and widely known as Michael Dell’s mentor; and Michael Long, a seasonedexecutive with close ties to Kleiner.Up to this point, there was little public knowledge of EEStor’s existence, letalone what the company was all about. It wasn’t until privately held Feel GoodCars (renamed ZENN Motor Company in 2007) had a public share issue in February2006 and began trading on a Canadian stock exchange that information about thissecretive company from Texas began to trickle into the public domain. A monthlater, my first major feature about EEStor was published in the Toronto Star,after which the mainstream media began tracking the story more closely, and thevolume of chatter in the online investor universe rose. Postings on my blog,cleanbreak.ca [http://www.cleanbreak.ca], about EEStor attracted thousands ofobsessed readers and hundreds of comments. But it wasn’t until 2007 thatinterest in EEStor truly exploded, and the story took on a life of its own, onethat was, at times, quite dramatic. Online reports of EEStor, in the blogosphereand on traditional media sites, became lightning rods for largely anonymousspeculation and debate about the company’s technology and its chances ofcommercial success. Every statement from Weir or Clifford was seized on, parsed,and analyzed for its significance. EEStor’s technology patents were dissectedand challenged. Some called EEStor a scam and Weir a snake-oil salesman, whileothers preferred to keep an open mind and cheer on the company as it attemptedto achieve what many branded unlikely, if not impossible. There were bothboosters, who owned shares of ZENN and were trying to influence the stock, andbashers, a mixed bag of engineers and scientists suffering from technology envy(what some might call “not discovered here syndrome”) or mudslingers paid byEEStor’s competitors to discredit Weir by trash-talking his work. After all,EEStor wasn’t just threatening the fossil-fuel industry; it was threatening allother high-tech ventures out there hoping to cash in on demand for better energystorage. Between those two extremes was the mushy middle of true believers andskeptics who followed EEStor’s story like it was a television soap opera.Leap of FaithMichael Blieden became one of the followers. The Californian documentaryfilmmaker got hooked by EEStor’s story in 2008. He quickly grasped the enormousglobal implications of what Weir and Nelson were trying to achieve, but he wasjust as intrigued by the volume of online buzz that had developed around thisstrangely named company that demonstrated no desire for the attention it wasgetting. “The degree to which people, with little to go on, invested emotionallyin this technology fantasy was fascinating to me,” said Blieden, who became partof the growing legion of EEStorians. The story was so unusual, so interesting,that he decided in August 2008 to make a documentary about this EEStorphenomenon. Blieden spent five months and his own money traveling the continentresearching and conducting interviews with scientists, investors, bloggers,journalists, and other individuals caught in EEStor’s web of intrigue — myselfincluded. “My angle was to tell the story of the technology,” he said, “what itcould do, but also to put on display the emotional conviction of the people whocared, while also showing my own transformation into one of those people. Basedon what? I’m an atheist. I reject the god concept because of lack of proof. Yethere I was doing all of this, without any proof, because of a batterytechnology. It just didn’t make any sense. I think a small part of it is thewill to believe it.”By this time, the story had gotten juicier. In January 2007, the company put outits first press release, which was filled with all sorts of technicalinformation about the “purification, concentration, and stability” of thechemicals and materials used in its process, all of it certified by anindependent third party. The next milestone, it said, was to get certificationof the barium titanate powders used in its final product. “EEStor Inc. remainson track to begin shipping production 15 kilowatt-hour Electrical Energy StorageUnits (EESU) to ZENN Motor Company in 2007 for use in their electric vehicles,”according to the statement.7 [e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-7] I managed to convince Weirto chat about the press release for an article I was writing for the website ofMIT’s respected journal Technology Review. Weir didn’t mince words. “Thisannouncement says we’ve not only met our goals, but we’ve beat them,” he said.“We’ve achieved something dramatic, and there’s no bullshit associated with it.”I asked him if there was too much hype around EEStor and its technology. “Idon’t hype things,” he snapped back. “We’re not a hype company, and we’re wellon our way to doing everything we said.” And what was his long-term plan? “Tomake North America the energy capital of the world.”There it was for the world to see: EEStor would deliver a working EESU to ZENNby the end of 2007. Expectations for all observers were now at an all-time high,and ZENN’s Clifford was stoked. “That’s thrilling for us,” he told me at thetime. “We can’t wait. We’re first in line. We’re the first guys in. We took theinitial risk and really believed in what they are doing.” Buoyed by the update,ZENN negotiated another deal with Weir that three months later would see itinvest $2.5 million in EEStor, giving the company a 3.8 percent ownership in thefirm. ZENN also had the option of investing another $5 million after EEStorcertified the permittivity of its barium titanate powders, which made up thedielectric in an EESU.8 [e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-8] (Permittivity levels indicatethe amount of charge that can be stored in the device without letting currentleak across the two ultracapacitor plates.) But one had to wonder whether EEStorand ZENN were getting ahead of themselves.That was Andrew Burke’s view. A researcher at the University of California–Davisand recognized expert on energy storage technologies for the transportationsector, Burke was among the many who continued to express both concerns aboutEEStor’s claims and doubts about the company’s stated commercializationschedule. It is one thing to make ceramic powders and prototypes in a controlledlaboratory, he said, but quite another to churn out reliable, safe, andlong-lasting energy storage devices on a production line at low cost and highquality. There is a long history of companies that have tried and failedrepeatedly to bring such innovations out of the lab and into the real world. Whywould EEStor be any different? “It’s interesting that they’re making progress,”Burke told me. “I have no doubt they can develop that kind of material, and themechanism that gives you this kind of energy storage is clear. But it’s a bigstep from making powders to making devices.” And even if EEStor could deliver aproduct to ZENN by the end of 2007, the idea that EESU-powered cars could starthitting showrooms shortly after was naive at best. What about warranties? Roadtests? All the regulatory hoops to jump through? The path to commercializationis much longer and more complicated than simply getting delivery of product. Ifthese realities didn’t bolster skepticism of EEStor, then its failure to delivera product to ZENN by the end of 2007, as Weir had promised, certainly did. Thecompany didn’t even meet its “permittivity” milestone by the end of that year.There would be no year-end fireworks for the EEStor faithful.Being DickAs expectations outside the company were rising, there was much infighting goingon behind the scenes. Kleiner Perkins, which as a highly influential venturecapital firm was accustomed to being heard and having its way, grew increasinglyfrustrated with Dick Weir’s stubborn management style. “Weir is very definiteabout how it’s going to be, and he’s determined to not be anybody’s fool, ortolerate anybody having influence over him,” explained Ed Beardsworth, the manwho first connected Kleiner with EEStor. Kleiner was unhappy with EEStor’srelationship with ZENN and tried to pressure Weir — through boardrepresentatives Mort Topfer and Michael Long — to wiggle out of its agreementwith the Canadian company. The venture capital firm felt that ZENN was gettingtoo sweet a deal through its exclusivity agreement with EEStor and that Weir hadnegotiated away too much, too early. Weir, on the other hand, was determined tohonor the deal with ZENN and was put off by Kleiner’s attempts to micromanagehis business, or, as one source put it, “having the suits looking over hisshoulder.” Kleiner brought experience and connections to EEStor and had thepotential of opening many doors, but Weir far too often rejected the firm’sadvice. “He would say, ‘I know what I’m doing, thanks for the money, I’ll letyou know as things progress.’ Kleiner didn’t like that approach at all,”according to one insider. “Weir doesn’t have any problem at all with maintaininga distant relationship with people, and he’s not afraid to tell people to take ahike.”Hoping to get their side of the story, I reached out to both Kleiner and Topferand received no response. But here is what I managed to cobble together throughwell-placed sources: Kleiner ruffled some feathers when it decided to go behindWeir’s back and sell a portion of its preferred shares to Topfer and Long,giving Kleiner a full return on its initial investment. This little side dealput Kleiner in a comfortable position. It still had much upside if EEStor hit itbig, but it also faced little, if any, risk if EEStor crashed and burned. Therelationship got strained even further after Weir struck a deal with ZENN as away to guard against a takeover by Kleiner, which had an option to buy moreshares that could have led to a controlling stake in EEStor. This transactionwith ZENN, as one insider put it, “was the final nail in the coffin” for Weir’srelationship with Kleiner. The venture capital firm still owned about 20 percentof EEStor as of year-end 2010, but it’s now sitting on the sidelines as a morepassive investor. “We stay friends,” Weir once said. I’m not sure Kleiner seesit this way.Throughout this, Mort Topfer became tired of being a ping-pong ball betweenEEStor and Kleiner, so the former vice chair of Dell Computer decided in mid2007 to temporarily step down from EEStor’s board. Topfer, it seems, struggledwith what he felt was a personal conflict of interest. The Topfer and Weirfamilies know each other well. Dick Weir’s sons, Tom (now general manager andvice president of operations at EEStor), Richard, and Greg worked at Dell inAustin with Mort Topfer’s sons, Alan and Richard. At the same time, Topfer was arepresentative of Kleiner and had a responsibility to look out for itsinterests. The safest thing to do was eliminate himself as the middleman andwait until the dust settled. And eventually it did. Weir put out a press releasein January 2008 to announce that Topfer was back on EEStor’s board. It waswidely rumored that Topfer was helping Weir establish a licensing deal with DellComputer, which would use its exclusive access to EEStor’s energy storagetechnology to gain an edge over rivals, particularly lower-cost competitors fromChina. There was no substance to the rumors, however, other than Topfer’s closeconnection to Dell and the fact that such a deal would make great sense.(Sometime in spring 2009, Topfer, who was 72 at the time, once again resignedfrom EEStor’s board, leading to speculation that the company was having problemswith its production process. But Topfer may have had other reasons unrelated toEEStor’s performance, as he also left the board of computer chip giant AdvancedMicro Devices just a few months later.)Weir was on a bit of a roll that January, and that set the tone for much of2008. The same day that he announced Topfer’s return to EEStor’s board anotherpress release came out, this time from military contractor Lockheed Martin. The$40-billion behemoth, which employs 140,000 people around the world, disclosedthat it had signed an exclusive international rights agreement with EEStor. Thedeal gave Lockheed Martin the license to integrate and market EESUs for anymilitary and homeland security applications — sensors, weapon systems, vehicles,basically anything that requires power and mobility on the battlefield. I spokethat same day with Lionel Liebman, a program manager who oversees appliedresearch at Lockheed’s missiles and fire control division. “I think it’s veryreal,” he said of EEStor’s technology. Liebman added that he had visited thecompany’s facility in Cedar Park, Texas, and was impressed with the progress. Hewent on to talk about the challenge of getting power to soldiers in the field,relying less on conventional fuels and using more renewable energy in a militarycontext. EEStor’s EESU could be a game-changer, he said, adding that Lockheedwould work closely with the company to build new prototypes. One projectLockheed was deeply involved in was the development of rechargeable,light-weight body armor for soldiers that could double as a power source forin-field weapons and other portable gadgets, or even biometric sensors thatcould monitor and transmit soldiers’ vital signs in real time. In other words,the armor would be a wearable battery designed to protect soldiers, who are lessnimble in combat when required to haul around 10 or 20 pounds (or more) oflithium-ion batteries. In a “body armor” patent filed later that year, Lockheedspecifically mentioned EEStor as a possible source of power storage for theruggedized military vest.Weir the patriot, the Marine jetfighter pilot, the man who worked on top-secretprojects for the Star Wars program, must have felt in his element. “I’m reallyin deep with Lockheed,” he is heard saying on his leaked interview, and thisrelationship with Lockheed appeared to be paying off. But Lockheed’s involvementraised a new batch of questions. Did EEStor have a working prototype? Did thisnew Lockheed distraction explain why EEStor didn’t deliver product to ZENN bythe end of 2007, as initially promised? Was Weir holding back on something? Whywould an industrial giant like Lockheed go out of its way to put out a pressrelease? The rumor mill continued to grind and conspiracy theories began toflourish. It seemed the more information that was revealed about EEStor, thegreater the mystery surrounding the company and the more polarizing it became.When would the world get to kick the tires on a real, working product?Waiting GameAll of this built-up anticipation seemed to make Dick Weir crankier than usual.He didn’t like having to defend EEStor or explain its delays, or having his work— at least what was known through his many patents — doubted or misinterpreted.The speculation bothered him, but his unwillingness to open up made speculationthe only option. This is the conundrum for anyone working on disruptivetechnology: be too transparent and people will question what you’ve got; be tooclosed and people will question what you’ve got. It can be a no-win situation,as speculation equals risk, and too much risk makes it more difficult to attractstrategic partners and the kind of funding necessary to take the big leap fromR&D to commercial production. Miss too many deadlines without explanation, andpeople — from anonymous bloggers to potentially important customers andsuppliers — are bound to suspect that something is wrong, even though suchdelays could have nothing to do with the technology. EEStor’s dysfunctionalrelationship with Kleiner didn’t help matters, as word of such tensions spreadquickly through business circles. “Frankly, I couldn’t tell you if EEStor is abad idea, a good idea, or a fraudulent idea,” venture capitalist and formerKleiner partner Vinod Khosla told me in a conversion in spring 2010. “My bet isit’s probably a good idea that needs more help; that the founders don’t knowwhat to get because they think they know what they’re doing.” Khosla, still anaffiliated partner with Kleiner, has always said he is “somewhat skeptical” ofEEStor but has never denied that the science behind its technology can’t be madeto work.9 [e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-9] All of this is a reminder that good technologyalone, however disruptive its potential, does not determine success or failurein a market with many moving parts and self-interested players.The next time I had a chance to speak to Weir was in July 2008, after heannounced a milestone was met, originally scheduled for 2007. EEStor disclosedthat it was producing the materials in its EESUs — the modified barium titanatepowders and aluminum oxide particle coatings — at high enough purities totolerate the extreme voltages the device was designed to handle. As with theprevious milestone, the claim was certified by Dr. Edward Golla, laboratorydirector for chemical testing facility Texas Research International, whoappeared to be moonlighting as an independent consultant. I asked Weir when aworking product would be shipped to ZENN. “I’m not going to make claims on whenwe’re going to get product out there; that’s between me and the customer,” heshot back, but he also spoke like a man on the cusp of something big. “It’s thehome run,” he said. “All the key production items have now been certified to gointo production, and all the equipment to do it is sitting in our factory.” Thenext step sounded like it would be major expansion; no longer was EEStor doingR&D or pre-production. From this point on, it was about high-volume production,which he wanted to “wrap up” by the end of the year. “Like shit going through agoose,” he told me. “Now it’s just turning a production crank and putting themachinery in.” He indicated he was working 16-hour days, seven days a week andstaying up late at night hammering out patents, and labeled the whole effort ashis “Manhattan II” project. Soon he would certify permittivity, then an EESUcomponent and then a full EESU. “After that, we’ll all go to Tijuana and getdrunk for a month.” Was he worried about competition? “If we get challenged,we’ll move to scale up. We’ve got a lot of knowledge built up.”That was a lot for the online community to chew on, and it was around this timethat Internet chatter reached a fever pitch. In 2007, much of the online debatetook place on blogs, such as my Clean Break blog or the GM Volt blog,established by electric-car enthusiast Dr. Lyle Dennis as a way to trackprogress on General Motor’s much-anticipated Chevrolet Volt. EEStor followersalso gathered in the comment areas on news sites, such as MIT Technology Review,which had published articles about EEStor, or in Yahoo and Stockhouse investorbillboards. Noticing all of this online traffic, an anonymous blogger based inthe Washington, D.C., area decided get in on the action. Known only as “B,” hecreated the Barium Titanate blog and later built it into a dedicated website,TheEEStory.com.10 [e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-10] “There are a few thousand who readthe site each day, and on [days with] news, it can get close to 20,000 uniquevisitors,” said B. The site quickly became a sort of Wikipedia dedicated to allthings EEStor. Ed Beardsworth, who has tracked EEStor’s progress since he firstintroduced Kleiner to Weir, said the site’s several writers and regular visitorsdig up everything, including patents, timelines, background information on thecast of characters involved with EEStor, and any story that mentions thecompany. Some have gone as far as submitting freedom of information requests tothe U.S. government, including to the Pentagon, seeking access to letters andmemos that mention EEStor. They even do original research, including interviewswith “people of interest.” What they get back, they immediately post on thesite. “There must be something the size of Encyclopedia Britannica assembled inthat EEStor archive,” said Beardsworth.Michael Blieden, the documentary filmmaker, was also on top of the story. “Iwent deep,” he said, having convinced himself that EEStor, even if notultimately successful, couldn’t be a scam. Dick Weir and Carl Nelson wereexperts in what they were doing. The relationships with Kleiner and Lockheedwere far too compelling to ignore. Blieden had heard rumors that the bigannouncement — the big product reveal — would now be taking place in March 2009,so he packed his gear, kissed his wife goodbye, and drove from California toAustin, Texas, where he sublet an apartment. “I thought I needed to be there tocapture the moment.” But life, as it so often does, got in the way. Bliedenreceived a call at the end of January from the makers of Late Night with JimmyFallon, a new comedy-talk show on NBC. It was a big break for Blieden, so hetemporarily shelved his documentary and moved to New York. “This project isstill very close to my heart,” he said. “It’s still my number two priority.” Itwas a good move in retrospect, as he didn’t miss much. March 2009 came and wentwith nothing but silence from EEStor.There was some progress made through 2009, even if climactic expectationsweren’t met. EEStor announced in April that the permittivity tests of itschemical powders were certified and exceeded targets, meaning its device wascapable of meeting the company’s claim of storing enormous amounts ofelectrostatic energy. After the achievement of this milestone, ZENN exercisedits option of investing another $5 million in EEStor and upping its stake in theTexas firm to 10.7 percent. Then, in July, the 30-minute conference call betweenpotential investors and Dick Weir mysteriously made it onto YouTube. In it, Weirtalked confidently about his EESU “making wind farms operate like coal plants”and offering “three to five times more energy storage” for laptop computers andhandheld devices, which would “never degrade” and “charge in seconds.” He saidhe was “knee deep” with people in the portable tool industry who were waitinganxiously for EESUs to emerge. Regarding electric vehicles, he said ZENN wouldget its EESUs at a cost of $100 per kilowatt-hour, excluding associatedelectronics, compared to $350 to $1,200 for competing lithium-ion technologies.“Nobody is going to compete with us, certainly no lithium-ion,” he insisted.Weir, having failed to deliver in 2007 and 2008, also offered a new forecast.“I’m already out there putting EESUs together, and I’m still in June. I’m aheadof schedule,” he said, seemingly oblivious to how much the schedule had changedover the years. He said ZENN would get pre-production prototypes by the end of2009, at which time “all hell is going to break loose” heading into 2010. Wasthis all an embarrassing disclosure of a confidential chat, or was it a cleverstunt? Like a never-ending soap opera, EEStor, even if unwittingly, continued todeliver new plot twists without actually delivering product. By the end of 2010,there was still no EESU.Fool Me Once . . .Energy blogger Charles Barton once wrote that EEStor will turn out to be one oftwo stories: “The first will be a story of great deception, with self-deceptionperhaps playing a key role. The second would be of a great technological triumphby brilliant American inventors, Texans who made oil obsolete.” Needless to say,in 2010 the group who thought EEStor a scam or a misfired missile was growing,and the believers were beginning to lose their faith. The leaked conference callseemed to plunge EEStor into darkness, and ZENN stopped speculating aboutdelivery dates, likely because securities regulators in both Canada and theUnited States slapped their hands. What ZENN did announce in September 2009 wasa gradual shifting of its business strategy, presumably in an effort to stayfocused and conserve cash. Where it once had grand plans to make its ownEEStor-powered car, the cityZENN, it was now going to concentrate efforts ondeveloping an electric-vehicle drive train, dubbed ZENNergy, which would bebased on EEStor’s technology and supplied to customers, namely the majorautomakers. In other words, little ZENN, instead of getting into thecapital-intensive business of making cars, would pursue an “Intel-inside”business model. ZENN also said it was discontinuing production of its existinglow-speed electric vehicle and getting out of that market entirely. Its future,for better or worse, was now in EEStor’s hands.Ian Clifford, shortly after ZENN announced its transition plans, did a noble jobof hiding his own impatience while sipping coffee one fall morning in 2009. Hewas anxiously waiting like everyone else, as EEStor is not obliged by anycontract to meet a specific delivery date. But the difference for Clifford,unlike everyone else, was that the future of his company was directly tied tothe outcome. “Obviously, our entire business model is dependent on EEStorcommercializing that technology,” he told me, choosing his words more cautiouslythan in the past. There were no more public mentions of targets and deadlinesand schedules. “Delays are frustrating to the extent that the whole world iswaiting. Internally, I know what Dick is working on and why he’s taking the timehe’s taking, but like anything disruptive, it can’t be happening soon enough,”he said. “We remain optimistic. The transformative moment is with the commercialproof, and when that day comes the whole tenor of the discussion changes toexcitement about the reality, not just the promise.”11 [e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-11]The outside world, however, isn’t sitting idly by waiting for EEStor to comethrough. The longer Dick Weir takes, the more opportunity there is forcompetitors to close the gap. How quickly is the gap closing? I posed thisquestion to Dave Pascoe, vice president of the electric-car systems division atauto parts giant Magna International, as we sat in Magna’s cafeteria. “It’s avery active area right now,” said Pascoe, a tall and lean man who looks a bitlike a 40-something Jimmy Stewart. “A lot of companies recognize this is a bigopportunity if you can come up with a cost-effective, high-energy, high-powerstorage device.” Pascoe is an open-minded guy who likes to collect quotationsfrom interesting people. On his BlackBerry device, he pulled up a memorablequote he’d solicited during a meeting with U.S. inventor extraordinaire DeanKamen, founder of DEKA Research and Development Corporation and creator of theSegway Personal Transporter. It read: “School teaches you how to fail; itdoesn’t teach you how to succeed. To succeed you have to be willing to fail. Youhave to be willing to be ridiculed and the ridiculers will be right and it willhurt.” Pascoe is exposed to all sorts of new technologies kept from the publiceye, and he knows that failure is a necessary part of invention and innovation.It’s for this reason, perhaps, that he talked with a sense of hope as herecalled (but wouldn’t name) the many bleeding-edge storage technologies he hasseen. “We won’t necessarily see a 10-times improvement, but there are certainlygame-changers out there,” he said. I asked him about EEStor. “Quite honestly, Ihope they’re successful, but I still only give them a 5 percent chance.” Untilthe game-changers come, Pascoe figured plug-in electric vehicles will be limitedto capturing 1 percent, maybe 2 percent of all new vehicle sales by 2020. Someexperts are more optimistic. Sarwant Singh, vice president of the automotivetechnology practice at research firm Frost & Sullivan, predicted in 2009 thatwithin 10 years hybrid and purely electric vehicles will account for 7 to 12percent of all new cars globally, with Chinese manufacturers representing nearlyhalf the market.12 [e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-12]The Chinese are forcing a worldwide acceleration of energy innovation, a growingconcern for U.S. officials who fear their country is falling behind. U.S. EnergySecretary Steven Chu has said that America faces a “Sputnik moment” when itcomes to clean energy — a reference to the Soviet Union’s 1957 satellite launchthat triggered a Cold War space race and led to an era of unprecedentedtechnology innovation in America. Speaking in late 2010 at the National PressClub in Washington, D.C., Chu touted some made-in-America companies that couldput the United States back on track. He specifically mentioned Arizona-basedFluidic Energy, which is working with Arizona State University on a new type of“metal-air” battery capable of “carrying a four-passenger electric car 500 mileswithout recharging, at a cost competitive with internal combustion engines.”Fluidic and Arizona U are aiming for energy densities of at least 900 watt-hoursper kilogram and up to a stunning 1,600 watt-hours per kilogram — three to fivetimes what EEStor claimed in its original patents.13 [e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-13](In September 2010, EEStor amended one of its patents to indicate it can achievea three-fold increase in energy storage over its original claim, putting it inline with the energy densities being pursued by Fluidic Energy.14[e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-14])Interestingly enough, while critics continue to dog and doubt EEStor, there isgrowing interest in academic circles of the potential of ultracapacitors as areplacement for, not just a complement to, electrochemical batteries. In April2010, for example, the U.S. Department of Energy granted tens of millions ofdollars in funding to high-risk, high-reward energy storage researchinitiatives, including one ultracapacitor project at Penn State Universitythat’s aiming to design a “cost-effective alternative to battery solutions” withpotential for “higher cycling” and “high power density.” Penn State, knownglobally for its expertise in materials science, is partnered in the projectwith Recapping Inc., a stealthy company that is headed by Alex Kinnier of KhoslaVentures. Vinod Khosla has always had a cautious fascination with EEStor, and itnow appears he’s backing an EEStor-like company of his own. He denies it, ofcourse. In an email, Khosla described Recapping as a “science investigation”that shares little in common with EEStor. Still, one could argue that EEStor,win or lose, has inspired such investigations and brought consideration to atechnological pathway historically written off as a dead-end pursuit. Thedifference is that EEStor, unlike Recapping and Fluidic Energy, is well pastinvestigation and R&D. In Weir’s mind, commercialization is the next stage andEEStor’s impact on the world is imminent, even if the view from the outsideisn’t as rosy.The Road AheadNearing the end of 2010, the popular green-technology news siteGreentechMedia.com published an article titled, “Is the EEStor Saga Finished?”It was a fair question, considering, as the article pointed out, there was still“no news, no website, no chatter from the ultracapacitor urban legend except forsome government skepticism.”15 [e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-15] The governmentskepticism the article referred to related to U.S. Air Force Research Laboratorydocuments obtained through freedom of information requests.16[e06_TESLA-1.html#x6-16] In them, various individuals at the lab, whose nameswere blacked out, expressed their doubts about EEStor. One individual saidEEStor was “full of it” and another, while recognizing the potential of thetechnology to revolutionize many energy and technology applications, advised labstaff to distance themselves from the company. Their opinions weren’t based onwhat they knew; they were based on what they didn’t know. Again, Dick Weir’stendency to hide his cards and put on a poker face hadn’t helped matters. Butwhen you’re sitting on a potentially world-changing technology, how much is safeto reveal? Clearly, Weir has an interest in protecting his intellectual propertyand remaining ahead of potential rivals, including the Chinese, for as long aspossible. “Where’s the happy medium?” asked Ian Clifford, who is sympathetic toWeir’s dilemma. “It’s really hard to find that balance. And really, show me adisruptive technology that doesn’t have a polarized audience. It comes with theterritory.” It may be that no amount of proof, save a mass-produced workingproduct, will satisfy the skeptics.Kleiner Perkins, it should be noted, it still watching EEStor closely and hasnot written off the company’s chances just yet. That was the impression Bill Joyleft while speaking in April 2011 at a technology event hosted by theMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Joy, a partner in Kleiner Perkins’ greentechnology practice and co-founder of computing giant Sun Microsystems, is knownfor having stickhandled the venture capital firm’s early investment in EEStor.Joy has kept quiet about EEStor for several years, but when asked at the eventif he still had confidence in the company he replied, “Oh, yeah,” at the sametime emphasizing the difficulty of its mission. “What they are proposing to dois wild. And there are lots of reasons some of these things could fail to becommercialized. . . . But worthwhile things usually are hard, and they alwaystake longer.” Joy said EEStor’s capability to deliver directly relates to theknowledge that Carl Nelson has brought to the venture. “I mean, if you ask Carl,tell me something about hafnium, Carl will talk to you for 15 minutes abouthafnium. He knows something about every element in the periodic table. He cantell you off the top of his head what its crystal forms are and otherinteresting properties. . . . You just have dinner with him and you realize hereally understands what he is doing with materials.” As for Dick Weir, Joyneglected to mention his name.EEStor may have already had its coming-out party by the time you read this. Ormaybe it has filed for bankruptcy. Or perhaps nothing much has changed — wecould all still be waiting, debating, scouring, analyzing, encouraging, andtrash-talking what may shape up to be the story of the century or the dud of thedecade. Whatever the outcome, the world envisioned by Dick Weir will eventuallycome, even if Weir isn’t the one to deliver it. We will have electric cars andscooters and bicycles that can travel hundreds of miles on a single charge andwhich middle-class families can easily afford. We will have an electricitysystem supplied increasingly by solar and wind energy that can be storedinexpensively and tapped when we need it. It’s a question of when, not if.Energy transitions have historically been painfully slow, and even disruptivetechnologies can still get bogged down along the path to commercialization.There are simply too many powerful interests, established industries, standingin the way. But if it wasn’t for people like Weir, those mad-as-Tesla characterswho put it all on the line out of a belief that they can change the world forthe better, we would never get to where we need to be. Weir isn’t “full of it” —nobody who can bring big names like Lockheed Martin, Kleiner Perkins, and MortTopfer to the table is.

He wasapproached by a “high net worth” individual who was part of an investor groupwith major energy and other assets throughout Asia. Like most of us, thisindividual wasn’t happy with the state of the world. Climate change. Pollution.Energy security. Energy scarcity on an overpopulated planet. You name it. Hewanted Beardsworth to oversee a project, dubbed The Hub Lab, which would striveto identify and fund the next big discovery in energy physics, the kind of tabooscience historically dismissed and derided by the mainstream scientific andinvestment communities.The ideas and technologies discussed so far in this book would seem safe bets bycomparison, despite the enormous skepticism and many challenges they face.Whether a technology can be developed cheaply enough, is safe, can scale up, isbased on materials that are widely available, can attract capital, can be madeto work as envisioned, or is compelling enough to take on established industriesor completely overhaul supply chains — those are some ways of measuring what’scommercially possible, of determining chances of success or failure. WhatBeardsworth was seeking out, however, were potentially disruptive technologiesthat, at their core, were believed to be scientifically impossible. His job wasto tap into a vast underground network of scientists and inventors working atthe fringe, get to know them, learn about their work, and then supply funding tothe handful who showed the most promise. The project lasted two years and, inall, Beardsworth handed out seven grants.“It was more fun than anybody should be able to have,” recalled Beardsworth, wholooked at everything from cold and aneutronic fusion to so-called free energydevices to systems that harvest zero-point energy. Much of what he saw had nobacking theory and some projects claimed to defy known laws of physics. Figuringout which ones to fund was no easy task. “We wanted fringe science, but wedidn’t want the wild-eyed, naive nut jobs out there, because this just takes youoff in incredible directions. You don’t know if a person is sane or not, or ifthey have any clue what they’re talking about,” said Beardsworth. “Becausepeople are stretching the limits and coming up with new ways of seeing theworld, you don’t necessarily have a ready way to evaluate it.” Much of the time,he said, it came down to what the person was like, not just the technology. “Wecared as much about the personality and work style of the person we gave grantsto as we did their ideas. Is it somebody who’s going to keep a careful labnotebook, properly record measurements, show data, and be methodical? Theproblem is that 90 percent of the people are probably not worth the time of day.The other 10 percent that are competent and grounded get lost in the noise andtarred with the same brush.”Do we know all there is to know about everything? Are established laws ofphysics the last word on science? Is there room for these laws to be broken,amended, or broadened? Is there energy out there that we haven’t discovered orhaven’t figured out how to tap? History has shown us that there is always moreto know, and figures from our past, including Nikola Tesla, are held up as proofthat there’s not just room for unconventional thinking, but that challengingwhat we know and taking an unorthodox approach has rewarded us before and canreward us in years ahead.As recently as the early 2000s, the U.S. Department of Energy told Ukrainedefector Dr. Valeriy Maisotsenko that the super-efficient air-conditioningsystem he had developed defied the laws of thermodynamics.1[e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-1] As a result, they rejected his request for a developmentgrant. Five months later, Maisotsenko, who lived in Denver, sent the governmentnaysayers a prototype they could test. What they thought was impossible turnedout quite real: an air-conditioning machine that used 80 percent less energythan a conventional system. They conceded that Maisotsenko had discovered a newthermodynamic cycle, which has since been named the Maisotsenko Cycle. A companyin Denver called Coolerado now sells the groundbreaking air conditioners, whichcost about 20 percent more but have an impressive two-year payback.2[e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-2] Clearly, there are still many surprises to bediscovered.Hydrino HopesSome scientific observers wonder whether BlackLight Power of Cranbury, NewJersey, has already uncovered another surprise, even if the rest of the worldisn’t yet prepared to see it. Founded by Harvard-trained medical doctor RandellMills in 1991, BlackLight claims it has discovered a non-polluting primarysource of energy called a hydrino, which it considers a form of hydrogen that is“likely” the dark matter of our universe. Mills believes a hydrino is alow-energy form of hydrogen, meaning that when a hydrogen atom is converted (orshrunk) into a hydrino it releases energy in the process — up to 200 times moreenergy than burning hydrogen gas directly as a fuel. It’s impossible accordingto established quantum theory, but Mills is looking to rewrite some of the rulesand is ruffling more than a few feathers in the process. “His theory reallypisses people off, because they don’t like their quantum mechanics rewritten bya mere doctor,” said Beardsworth.If Mills is right — there’s that big if again — the implications are enormous.Already, BlackLight says it has come up with proprietary chemical catalysts thattrigger the hydrogen-to-hydrino reaction, which releases tremendous amounts ofheat that can be used to generate clean and inexpensive electricity. The initialhydrogen comes from electrolysis of water, and the electricity needed for waterelectrolysis would represent less than 1 percent of total energy produced fromthe process, which BlackLight calls catalyst-induced hydrino transition (CIHT).“The process does not give rise to pollution, greenhouse gases, or radiation,”according to the company. It envisions making small electrical and heatgenerators for homes and communities that eliminate the need for theconstruction of large, multibillion-dollar power plants. Mills figures that theequivalent of 1,000 megawatts, which is about the generating capacity of acurrent-day nuclear reactor, could be fueled for a year with 32 million litersof water.3 [e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-3] That might sound like a lot, but considerthat a 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactor requires 1.8 trillion liters of water ayear just for cooling purposes, of which 18 billion liters is lost throughevaporation. BlackLight also sees its process powering spaceflight, airplanes,boats, trains, and as a source of energy for electric cars. “A CIHT electric caris expected to have a range of 1,500 miles on a liter of water,” according tothe company.Mills isn’t just another garage inventor living his 15 minutes of fame.Mainstream physicists may consider him a kook, but the Harvard doctor, who overthe years has pounded out several books and peer-reviewed papers on the subject,refuses to go away and continues to build support for his claims and theories.When he first introduced the concept of hydrinos in the early 1990s, he arguedthat what Pons and Fleischmann thought was cold fusion was actuallyhydrogen-to-hydrino conversion — they just didn’t know it. Mills also has analternate theory of the universe based on his discovery of hydrinos thatdirectly challenges the conventional Big Bang theory, which for most physicistsis considered settled science.4 [e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-4] Amazingly, he haspersisted. His company, based out of a former satellite manufacturing plantpurchased from Lockheed Martin in 1999, has reportedly raised more than $60million and employs a team of scientists working vigorously on commercialapplications of the core science.5 [e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-5]There has been some, though evidently not enough, independent validation of whatMills is doing. Since 2008, a team of scientists and engineers at New Jersey’sRowan University, led by chemistry professor Kandalam Ramanujachary, havevalidated that BlackLight’s process works on a small scale in a controlledsetting. BlackLight put out a press release in fall 2010 announcing thatRamanujachary’s team had validated another company claim: that electricity, notjust heat, had been directly generated from a device built around BlackLight’shydrogen-to-hydrino reactions. “With further optimization, there is no doubtthat this technology will present an economically viable and environmentallybenign alternate to meet global energy needs,” Ramanujachary is quoted as sayingin the release. “If advanced to commercialization, it would be one of the mostprofound developments ever.”6 [e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-6] Such a statement could endup a career-limiting move for Ramanujachary, and surely the Rowan Universityprofessor knows it. This makes his comment that much more compelling.Beardsworth, meanwhile, called BlackLight a “mystery wrapped in an enigma” andMills a “paranoid and secretive” inventor who carefully manages how his storyunfolds. “Whether or not he’s making excess energy remains to be seen,” saidBeardsworth. “He hasn’t been able to do it consistently, powerfully enough tomake a simple tradeshow demonstration of it, but maybe he will. Problem is, hewon’t disclose his ‘secret sauce’ and won’t let anybody get close enough toassure there are no hidden wires.” Mills reportedly has a public demonstrationplanned for sometime in 2011.7 [e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-7] Scientists can argueabout the underlying theory for decades if they wish. For the rest of us, wejust want to see something that works.A Potential DifferenceUnfortunately, there are only so many needles in the haystack, and the haystackis a mountain that keeps getting larger. Just as historical figures such asTesla can inspire true discovery, they can also fuel a disproportionate amountof delusion. Type the words “free energy” or “perpetual motion” or “over unity”into Google and you’ll see what I mean. There’s no shortage of folks makingextraordinary claims about a new energy invention that can supply the world withan endless supply of clean power or fuel. Entire conferences are devoted tothem, such as the annual TeslaTech conference in New Mexico that exploreseverything from cosmic energy to magnetic healing, or any other technology thatallegedly is being suppressed by the government or originated from alien beings.Conspiracy theories abound. “These people think Tesla was on the verge oftapping something magical before he died, and people who want magic in theirlives have adopted Tesla,” Beardsworth told me. “Whether Tesla lost his marbles[as he got older] or was still a genius with more to give, we don’t know. Butthere’s practically a religious fervor surrounding him.”I should point out that journalists like me are magnets for this crowd ofwell-meaning fringe inventors, and I don’t blame them for running to the media.Venture capitalists and bankers won’t hear them out. Academics and politicianstreat them like lepers. Newspapers and local TV news outlets, on the other hand,are often suckers for the sensational, and media exposure has a way of openingdoors — even if just a crack. We’ve all read the stories, like the inventor inPennsylvania who claimed to turn seawater into fuel by lighting it on fire withradio waves.8 [e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-8] In August 2006, an Irish company calledSteorn went so far as to place a full-page advertisement in The Economistchallenging the world’s top scientists to test the claim that it had developed“a technology that produces free, clean, and constant energy.” The ad quoted afamous line from Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, “All great truths beginas blasphemies.” It’s a very powerful and valid statement. But twist Shaw’scomment around and it’s equally fitting to say most blasphemies lead to nothinggreat. So far that has been the case with Steorn. Scientists did respond to themagazine advertisement and an independent 22-member jury concluded in 2009 thatthe company’s claim was rubbish.9 [e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-9]Here’s the problem: we can’t set up independent scientific juries every time acompany or individual comes forward and makes an extraordinary claim about atechnology that can benefit the world. This isn’t to say there aren’t people outthere working on serious science, however unorthodox their direction orunbelievable their assertions. It’s also not saying some of these ideas won’t ordon’t work. But we all can’t be dedicated to the cause like Ed Beardsworth wasin 2008, a seasoned energy technologist with a Ph.D. in physics who was given abundle of cash and told to go on a wild goose chase. And even he found himselfswimming in murky waters.What makes one extraordinary claim more worthy of exploring than the thousandsof other ones out there? How do we sift through the noise and isolate thebreakthroughs? How do we keep those rare game-changers from falling through thecracks? I struggle with these questions as a journalist. As an individual withno formal training in science or engineering, I find myself vulnerable to whatdocumentary maker Michael Blieden described as the “will to believe.” At thesame time, like any banker, academic, politician, or bureaucrat who may want tokeep an open mind, I am held back by practical matters. To truly delve deepenough into a claim requires a combination of personal time and financialcapital that most of us can’t afford, and a level of scientific knowledge mostdo not possess. For this reason, it’s difficult for even the most open-mindedobservers to go down that rabbit hole.Not to say I haven’t.In 2007, I received an email from a man by the name of Thane Heins. Heidentified himself as the founder of a company called Potential Difference thatwas based out of a lab room at the University of Ottawa. He explained how he hadspent the previous two years working on a new type of electric motor-generatorhe had invented in his basement. He called it the Perepiteia Generator, namedafter the Greek word “peripeteia,” which means a sudden change of events orreversal of circumstances. The device is designed to manipulate a phenomenoncalled back electromotive force, or back-EMF, which is a kind of magneticfriction that affects the efficiency of electric motors. Put simply, back-EMF ispart of what assures that the amount of energy that comes out of the device isless than what goes in. In physics, it is explained under the law ofconservation, Lenz’s law or the law of diminishing returns, and it can also beexplained under Maxwell’s theory. Heins claimed he had eliminated that friction,which would make his device 100 percent efficient. But more than that, he saidhe had figured out a way to redirect the magnetic field so that it could boost,rather than drag, the performance of the motor. If he could make it work in apractical application, it could enable what he called “regenerativeacceleration” in electric cars, meaning the vehicle could potentially charge upits batteries, rather than drain them, while accelerating. The faster you drove,the more juice you’d send to your battery pack. It would eliminate the need toplug in your electric vehicle. To charge it, all you would have to do was drive.I didn’t need to be an electrical engineer to know that this was a clearviolation of thermodynamic principles. Heins didn’t like to use the words“perpetual motion,” even if he did allude to it, but clearly he was saying hecould harness a source of energy previously unknown or untapped. Normally Iwould politely brush off this type of claim, but there was a hook to this story.Heins told me he would soon be traveling to Boston to demonstrate his technologyto Markus Zahn, a respected electrical engineering professor at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology and a program director at the university’sLaboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems. If there was anyonequalified to assess Heins’ claims it was Zahn, so I figured there was no harm inwaiting to hear what the good professor had to say.The Heins EffectI warmed up to Heins, and it became apparent soon enough that this wasn’t just astory about an unbelievable claim; it was also about an individual’s struggle tobe taken seriously. Heins was 46 when we first connected, and he struck me rightaway as a friendly but straight-talking fellow. He was the classic underdog —mildly dyslexic, weak in mathematics, and an underperformer in school. There wasno graduate degree in physics or engineering hanging on his wall. He did onceenrol in a community college electronics program in Quebec but never completedit. What he did have was a chef’s diploma, and that landed him some cooking jobsbefore he eventually started up his own restaurant in a small town near Ottawa.He also has strong political opinions and a keen sense of justice, which in someways explained his motivation as an entrepreneur and inventor. Heins saw fossilfuels as the root of instability in our society and the cause of needlesssuffering and death. He blamed the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, onour economic addiction to oil, and he was driven to make a difference, even ifit created havoc in his own life. Indeed, he was so obsessed with developing hisgenerator as a solution for breaking our oil addiction that his marriage fellapart. “I’ve tried to quit many times,” he once confided. “But I had this ideaand I believe it works.” For this reason, he has persisted when others mighthave given up, despite the ridicule and despite the number of slammed doors.The one door that hadn’t been slammed was at the University of Ottawa, whereHeins was permitted to conduct his experiments. Supervising his work was RiadhHabash, a professor with the university’s School of Information Technology andEngineering. A quiet and cautious man, Habash didn’t really want to talk when Icontacted him, but he acknowledged that Heins was able to cause an electricinduction motor to accelerate when it should be slowing down. “But when it comesto an explanation, there is no backing theory for it,” he said. “That’s whywe’re consulting MIT.” When Markus Zahn did eventually see Heins’ demonstration,he emerged somewhat baffled. He told me during a brief interview that he hadseen an “unusual phenomena” and that it was a surprise for him. Still, hedismissed any notion that it broke some law of physics. What it did do was leaveopen the possibility that Heins had come up with a way to make electric motorsmore efficient. “I saw it. It’s real,” Zahn said. “Now I’m just trying to figureit out.” Developing a more efficient motor wouldn’t be an insignificant outcome,he added. “There are an infinite number of induction machines in people’s homesand everywhere around the world. If you could make them more efficient,cumulatively, it could make a big difference.”I ended up writing about Heins and his meeting with Zahn in a story thatappeared in the Toronto Star on February 4, 2008. The response from the publicwas unexpected. Hundreds of emotional email messages flooded my inbox in theweeks that followed, and the story spread like wildfire through the bloggercommunity, including popular sites such as Gizmodo and Wired. Many messages andblog posts encouraged Heins to march on and demonstrated that powerful will tobelieve. They praised him for bumping up against the wall of scientificconformity and pointed out how others in the past — Nikola Tesla, Leonardo daVinci, Galileo, and the Wright brothers, to name just a handful — faced similardismissals that proved premature. “Anything that makes the scientific communitydefend their long-held beliefs is healthy,” wrote one commenter. “Too often theyscoff and dismiss like church scholars being told the Earth was not the centerof the universe.” But just as many readers ridiculed Heins and painted him aseither an obsessive lunatic or a scam artist looking for naive investors. Somealso took aim at me and the Toronto Star for giving Heins a platform to“mislead” and “confuse” the public. “Shame on you,” wrote one commenter. “Idon’t think it’s necessary to lend credence to perpetual motion machineinventors who are probably out to scam money from investors.” Needless to say,it was a controversial yarn, and it became the second-most read story on theToronto Star’s website for all of 2008.[images/207_fmt.jpeg]Thane Heins demonstrates his Perepiteia Generator at the University of Ottawa inJanuary 2010. The university offered him lab space to develop his technology.After that, I made a point of regularly checking in with Heins. I was curious tosee where all the public exposure would lead him. This, for me, had become ahuman interest story just as much as a technology story. Proving Heins right orwrong was not my intention, nor was it within my capacity to make such ajudgment. I wanted to see the moves Heins would make next as a result of myarticle, which, rightly or wrongly, put him in the media spotlight for a fewmore months and appeared to open up some more doors. How, I wondered, would heposition the technology as he attempted to take it to the next level? Would hepromote it as a breakthrough in energy efficiency, or risk more pushback byclaiming he was violating the law of energy conservation by achieving over unity— that is, getting more power out than going in? How would he react to ongoingskepticism? How well would he work with those who offered to help?Heins had an open-door policy through 2008 and 2009 that attracted a number ofcurious visitors to his lab for live demonstrations. For those who couldn’tattend in person, he created video demonstrations and tutorials and regularlyuploaded them to YouTube. It didn’t take long before undergraduate students atthe university began calling Heins’ work area the “Perpetual Motion Lab,” alabel he didn’t seem to mind at the time. Based on emails he shared with me, itappears Heins had serious queries from a number of respected governmentorganizations, including the magnetics lab at the NASA-Goddard Space FlightCenter, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and Defence Research andDevelopment Canada. (One scientist there said his interest was purely personaland not related to his role at the department.) But nothing ever seemed to comeof it. He was also approached by a number of businesses and organizationslooking to collaborate. For example, a generator supplier in California wantedto adapt Heins’ Perepiteia technology for use in a new line of products. Thepartnerships always seemed to start off well and gradually fizzle out. Each timeI contacted Heins for an update, he was onto the next project without completingthe previous one. He excelled at reaching out to people and was proficient atleveraging his interactions with one influential group or person as a way toestablish a dialogue with another.Magna-nimousOne person he reached out to was Dave Pascoe, the mechanical engineer heading upMagna International’s electric-vehicle systems division and an individual in aposition to help. Pascoe was curious enough by what Heins was claiming that hemade at least two trips to Ottawa in fall 2009 to see a demonstration. He hadhis doubts like anyone else, but was willing to listen and learn. “There aremany things in the past that have been disproven. I like to keep an open mind,and that’s one of the reasons I went out there,” Pascoe told me several monthslater. “Most people wouldn’t have done it, but for me, there’s the potentialside benefit that, while he may not be doing over unity on energy, he may havesomething that improves efficiency. Usually when you see something that’s notbehaving the way it’s expected to, there can be some nice unexpected surprises.”And that’s exactly what Pascoe observed during his time at Heins’ lab — oddmotor behavior, signs of improved motor performance, but no convincing evidencethat any laws of physics had been defied. His gut told him that Heins washelping an inefficiently run motor operate more efficiently, a theory I hadheard before but which Heins summarily dismisses. In fact, one individual whoadvanced such an explanation was dismissed by Heins as an “ignorant whiner.”10[e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-10]Still, Pascoe remained intrigued and wanted to see more data to back up Heins’extraordinary claims. He liked Heins and thought he was both smart and quiteaware of the nature of his claims, and Pascoe sympathized with what the inventorwas going through. “In his mind, he’s proven it to himself. If you put yourselfin his brain, he can’t understand why nobody believes him.” Pascoe suggestedthat Heins do another, more conclusive test that would more accurately verify orcast doubt on earlier measurements. “In my mind, I was doing him a favor.Disprove it and get on with your life, or prove it and move forward.” But Heinsresponded to the test request defensively. “Unfortunately, Dave has rejected the‘obviousness’ of the demos,” he wrote in an email at the time. “Magna wantsthese tests to compensate for their own lack of trust in the tests we havealready done.” He seemed willing enough to do the test but said he didn’t havethe $25,000 required to purchase a measurement device called a torque sensor,which Pascoe considered crucial for a proper evaluation. Nor did he have accessto one. So the new tests, to my knowledge, were never conducted.I asked Pascoe if he was concerned that he may be letting a potentiallybeneficial, if not disruptive, technology slip through the cracks, implying thatMagna could easily afford the cost of the test. “If we, as Magna, invested inevery early stage development somebody brought in, we would lose a lot ofmoney,” he explained. “Certainly, to say industry should look at all these isnot the answer, because there are just too many out there. The resource drainwould be completely unsustainable. Ultimately, when somebody comes up with thenext big winner, that person also has to have some kind of spirit or energy topush it forward or it fails. That’s how it has worked and that’s how it willcontinue to work.” In other words, the ball was in Heins’ court.There was no doubt Heins had that spirit, but he also had a tendency to getquarrelsome. At first introductions, he could be a calm teddy bear, and thisoften worked to his benefit by disarming those he approached. But hisfrustration could also get the better of him. In February 2009, he was invitedto pitch his technology to a panel of judges as part of a local innovation eventin Ottawa, but it ended in a shouting match. One of the judges wasmultimillionaire Robert Herjavec, who is a judge on the CBC television showDragon’s Den, a kind of American Idol for new business ideas. Heins didn’t getthe reaction he wanted, but he also didn’t like the way Herjavec flaunted hiswealth — his big gas-guzzling cars, mansion, and yacht.11[e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-11] It stood for everything Heins was against, and this ledto a firework of words in front of an audience of hundreds. It wasn’t the bestway for an underdog inventor to make friends, yet Heins has never hesitated toquestion motivations, to taunt, to accuse others of being cowardly for notbelieving. His preachy explanations for why people don’t believe, don’t returncalls, won’t see a demonstration, or won’t champion his cause can sound likeconspiracy theories in which he is a lone martyr fighting for the noble cause.“Some inventors are very frustrated at not getting heard, and they have a stylethat’s hard to listen to,” Amory Lovins, chief scientist at the Rocky MountainInstitute, once told me. “It goes with the territory.” That was becomingincreasingly evident.Still, Heins’ ability to build new relationships never ceased to amaze. In late2008, for example, Heins notified me that he had been contacted by Canadianrocker Neil Young. What could a music legend like Neil Young possibly want to dowith a struggling inventor in Ottawa? Most fans of Young would know that the60-something musician is an environmentalist who likes big cars, kind of likebeing a tree hugger who collects chainsaws. But Young doesn’t see it that way.Big is good, in his view, as long as the carbon footprint is small. So the“Godfather of Grunge” (a nickname he earned in the 1990s because of hisinfluence on Seattle bands such as Pearl Jam and Nirvana) launched a project in2008 to prove a big car could leave behind a small footprint. He would “repower”his 1959 Lincoln Continental convertible so it could run on electricity and bebacked up by renewable fuel or compressed natural gas. He wanted to makeautomotive history by giving his 2.5-ton, 19.5-foot vehicle the ability totravel for several hundred miles using the clean-energy equivalent of just a fewgallons of gasoline. Young called the rebuilt vehicle the LincVolt and heplanned to film every step of his journey for a documentary production.As part of this ambitious project, Young also entered the LincVolt into theProgressive Automotive X PRIZE competition, which promised a $10-million awardfor the best new vehicle design that could achieve 100 miles per gallon. To makegood on his vision, Young hired a team of engineers and car tinkerers led byuber-mechanic Johnathan Goodwin, a professional car hacker who has turnedgas-guzzling Hummers into 60-mile-per-gallon workhorses that sip French-frygrease and electricity.12 [e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-12] The LincVolt team, workingout of Goodwin’s workshop in Wichita, Kansas, included German-born physicist andinventor Uli Kruger and U.S. robotics expert Paul Perrone. “We’re doing a lot ofdifferent stuff that we don’t think has been done before,” Young told DavidLetterman on a Late Show appearance on January 30, 2009. “If I fail, who cares?I’m not afraid of failure.”Long May You RunThis pioneering attitude may explain Young’s willingness to approach ThaneHeins. The rocker was determined to think outside the box, and here was someinventor in Ottawa about as outside the box as one can get. But don’t think fora moment that Young’s rock-star status would earn him any reverence from Heins,as it didn’t take long before the teddy bear inventor showed he could growl. Thetwo men exchanged much information by email, and while Heins invited Young tovisit Ottawa and Young offered to fly Heins to Wichita, there is no evidencethey ever met. Heins indicated from the start he didn’t want to be in Young’sfilm and didn’t like the idea of the X PRIZE because he believed thatcollaboration, not competition, was a better approach. In an April 2008 email,he told Young that his participation in the X PRIZE meant he didn’t “get it,” towhich Young graciously replied, “I respect your conclusion about us, but I thinkit is hasty.” Young later added, “Personally I don’t give a rat’s ass whether wewin the prize or not. We are in a race against time. Not each other. However, itdoes rally a lot of energy and focus on the task.”In May 2008, the grizzly in Heins resurfaced. As he often did, Heins sent out anemail broadcast alerting individuals, including Young, to new test data anddemonstration videos uploaded to YouTube. Young, a very private individual, wasincluded openly on the email list and wasn’t pleased. He sent a gentle messageasking that Heins not include his personal address again, but also assured himthat “this in no way negates my enthusiasm and curiosity about your project.”Heins lashed back at the rock legend. “Are you serious?” he asked in a follow-upemail. “I am sorry but the information I sent and the ramifications of what itcan mean to humanity far outweigh your personal email address, not to mentionyour LincVolt project.” Then Heins really let it spill, revealing a delusionalside to his character. “What I have done is bigger than Einstein, Tesla, oranything Edison ever did — in fact, it is bigger than almost every previousscientific achievement combined.” If that didn’t sour the relationship, therewas more to come. “I hope your enthusiasm and desire [to work together] does nothinge on the fact that I agree with every shallow thing you say,” Heinsconcluded. Ouch! In a short reply, Young continued his gracious ways. “I amcompletely over it,” he wrote back.13 [e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-13]It’s little surprise that Young backed off from that point forward. The twostill occasionally exchange email, but Young’s position is simple: don’t justtalk about it, build a machine that puts out more power than it consumes. “Thaneis doing the development independently and when it is done, we will attempt todemonstrate the tech in a way that is meaningful to the public,” Young wrote mein an email in summer 2010. “We have not seen the results of his work in a realapplication for everyday use and can not verify them at this point. That is whatour aim is to do. It sounds interesting and although fringe, he is verycommitted and we appreciate his energy for the technology.” Young faced asetback himself that November when a fire broke out in the warehouse where hestored his LincVolt, which was partially damaged.14 [e07_TESLA-1.html#x7-14]Life in 2010 became more difficult for Heins. In March, he was asked to leavehis lab at the University of Ottawa. Professors there, including his supervisor,Professor Habash, now avoid him, and many of the bridges he built during 2008and 2009 have since crumbled. “We are in a cycle where we demo the technologysuccessfully and then they Google me and it is over,” Heins explained to me inan email. “I have been labeled as a nut bar by anyone who could help us and afanatic because I keep trying. I have been told to cease using Dr. Habash’sname, Ottawa University, or Ottawa University electrical engineering departmentnames.” Heins is undeterred. He continues to forge new relationships, hold opendemonstrations, and reach out to corporate giants such as General Motors, ABB,and Philips on the slight chance he can one day gain a credible ally. He hasrefined his motor-generator technology and attempted to come up with a backingtheory for its behaviour. As of June 2011, however, there was no sign of aworking prototype that could drive a real-world application. Within theengineering community, Heins has earned some arms-length encouragement, but sofar no one has publicly backed him, likely for fear of repercussions on theirown careers.Is Heins a victim of scientific groupthink? Is he being ostracized by a societyunwilling to believe? Certainly, there is a large portion of people out therewho are outright dismissive of Heins strictly because of the extraordinarynature of his claim. Would a reasonable person expect any less? But Heins hasdone himself no favors by coming off at times as the kind of “wild-eyed”inventor that even sympathetic ears like an Ed Beardsworth (or Neil Young) wouldrather keep at a distance.To this day, I have mixed views about it all. One side of me — the practical andsensible side — sees an outlandish assertion by a man with a volatilepersonality and an unwillingness to admit he may be wrong in the face of whatscience says is impossible. The other side — the hopeful, naive side with the“will to believe” — can’t help but wonder whether Heins has truly stumbled ontosome previously untapped source of magnetic energy and that, given time andpatience and the right people by his side, he may some day surprise us. Thisside of me credits Heins as an underdog for having the “boldness of ignorance,”a term that Nikola Tesla once used to describe himself.It’s important to keep in mind that Heins is not unique in his specific pursuit.He is one of among hundreds of individuals working away on over unity devicesthat claim to produce more energy than they consume. Science tells us you can’tcreate or destroy energy, but the still mysterious nature of magnetism has leftmany questions unanswered. Why else would NASA reach out to an individual likeHeins? “There are people who will go on for volumes, literally, about howMaxwell’s equations are incomplete and were simplified in the early days toleave out other cases. That if you build a simple and clever device, you can getenergy from magnetic fields,” said Beardsworth, who looked at several over unitymotor ideas as part of his role in the Hub Lab. “So far, nobody has builtsomething [that works] that has been objectively, carefully, and properlymeasured.”Whether it’s Randell Mills at BlackLight Power or Thane Heins at PotentialDifference, or anyone else with spirited determination and that boldness ofignorance, I’m prepared to be surprised.Are you?Notes:1 [e07_TESLA-1.html#x7x1] Patrick Doyle, “Rebirth of Cool,” 5820 Magazine.

But we’re facing deep problemsand we need everybody’s help.”— Stanford Ovshinsky, prolific American inventorNo matter how compelling an energy breakthrough, it has been argued that thenature of energy transitions will prevent such a breakthrough from having animmediate effect on our lives. Energy expert Vaclav Smil, a professor ofenvironment at the University of Manitoba and one of the most prolific writerson the subject, likes to routinely remind us of this reality. “Historicalevidence shows that energy systems, the most complex and capital-intensivemass-scale infrastructures of modern societies, are inherently inertial, andthat our determination can accelerate their change but cannot fundamentallyalter the gradual nature of their evolution.”1 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-1] To thinkotherwise is naive and to suggest that a potentially disruptive energytechnology can have a substantial and speedy impact is “irresponsiblyexaggerating the promise,” Smil writes. “They should become an important part ofan energy solution, but they cannot make as much difference, and as fast, as isnow so commonly believed.”2 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-2]This must always be kept in mind, as any new innovation — incremental ordisruptive — cannot escape going through the phases of discovery, development,demonstration, commercialization, and maturation, and there are dozens ofhurdles along the journey toward mainstream acceptance. I have attemptedthroughout this book to identify some of these hurdles and to explain how goodtechnology on its own isn’t enough to guarantee success. It’s only one step in along journey.Putting hundreds of massive solar power stations into orbit may be technicallypossible, and it may prove to be economical, but is it practical when weighedagainst less risky clean-energy alternatives? Can a company such as Solarenraise the enormous amount of financial capital required to do it? Can GarySpirnak satisfy the public’s concerns around safety, and will he be able toprove that taking solar to space is better than embracing its full potentialhere on Mother Earth?Louis Michaud knows he can economically harness waste heat and ocean heat tocreate man-made tornadoes that generate power, but can he raise enough money todemonstrate it? If he does, can he overcome the perception, however false it maybe, that his unorthodox idea is too dangerous to pursue on a large scale?Will Paul Woods at Algenol overcome many of the same perceptions, or willestablished fossil fuel interests and industries get in his way and forever keephim a niche biofuel player? Can his unique process deliver ethanol at the costand quantities that matter?Can Michel Laberge convince venture capitalists, government agencies, andregulators that General Fusion can do what multibillion-dollar internationalconsortia cannot? Can he find people with the right skills to help him achievehis goal, and will he have the staying power to make it to a finish line thatthe nuclear industry, dominated by fission reactor technologists, doesn’t wanthim to pass?Even if EEStor has a game-changing energy storage technology that’s proven towork, will it be hindered by the stubborn personality of its founder and bemarginalized by competitors — old and new — who see the company as a threat totheir own, incremental innovations? Will a technology that wows under controlledconditions be revealed as fragile and unreliable when mass-produced forreal-world applications?One, some, or all of these companies may overcome one, some, or all of thebarriers that lie ahead, and they may even achieve commercialization after manyyears of trying. But even if commercialized, the path to maturation can takedecades more because of the slow-moving nature of existing energy systems — acomplex and tightly bound interaction of machines, wires, pipelines, fuels,energy suppliers, and energy consumers that, taken together, are deeplyresistant to change. At the same time, most individual stakeholders in this oldboys’ energy club have an interest in stonewalling change to assure their ownsurvival, and behind them is a financial community that has grown fat byavoiding risk and not rocking the boat. We cannot underestimate the grip thatfossil fuels have on us or the challenge of transitioning to a low-carboneconomy.The venture capital community is one group that has learned this throughexperience. Not so long ago, Silicon Valley and its tech-savvy ilk got the greenbug, and many of the multimillionaires and multibillionaires who made it bigduring the computing, dot-com, and telecom booms decided that the next bigopportunity was in clean energy and green technologies. They raised manybillions of dollars and started pumping this money into next-generation solartechnologies, biofuels, batteries, fuel cells, vehicles, smart grid equipment,carbon-capture systems, geothermal projects, and other “greentech” innovations.Between 2001 and 2008, for example, global venture capital investment in cleantechnologies jumped from $507 million to well over $8 billion.3[e08_TESLA.html#x8-3] The recession caused a dip in 2009, but investment beganto climb again in 2010.What these investors realized soon enough is that, while the opportunities weremassive, breaking into the energy business takes much longer and requires farmore capital than, say, building the next big e-commerce site or search engine,designing a must-have software application, or even making the next hot consumerelectronics gadget. Rapid change may be built into the DNA of the informationtechnology sector and the Internet, but the energy sector is a beast dominatedby regional monopolies and global oligopolies. New innovation is embracedslowly, and far too often it’s viewed as a nuisance or threat rather than anopportunity. The energy sector has its own pace, set by the multitrillion-dollarglobal infrastructure it is determined to protect. This reality can bediscouraging, even for the world’s richest man. “You’re not going to have a lotof people putting down money when . . . the time period to get something done isactually longer than the length of the patent,” Microsoft co-founder Bill Gateslamented during an energy conference in 2010. “People like to work on thingsthat happen during their lifetime.”4 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-4] Silicon Valley, withall its influence, money, and business savvy has been forced to do something itdoesn’t like to do: be patient.Venture capitalists typically want in and out of investments in less than fiveyears — preferably within two or three years — and many of the most promisingnew energy technologies can’t be fully developed and deployed under such atimeline. “It might be fine with software, but not with innovation aroundbiomimicry,” said Jay Harman of PAX Scientific. This was a common observationwith the inventors and entrepreneurs I interviewed for this book, and MichaelBrown, the venture capitalist behind General Fusion, said it represents aserious barrier to innovation in the energy sector. “When Silicon Valley triesto play in clean technology hardware, it gets its head served on a platter,”said Brown, adding that the investment philosophy that thrived during thehigh-tech boom simply doesn’t work with energy. “The model is broken.”This and other barriers are delaying the essential and inevitable decline offossil fuels. In the electricity sector, for example, the International EnergyAgency estimated that coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuels used to generateelectricity will still be the dominant energy source in 2035 and that it willtake 25 years for their share to drop from 68 percent to 55 percent of theenergy mix. Solar power, by comparison, will only grow to represent 2 percent inthat timeframe. Renewables — the total mix of wind, hydro, solar, and others —could reach one third of electricity supply, up from 19 percent in 2008. But toget there, the agency said $5.7 trillion would need to be invested, and manybelieve that still won’t be enough to avert the worst effects of climatechange.5 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-5]From this perspective, the glass is half empty.There Is an UpsideI’m a glass half full type of person, so let me offer a more encouragingperspective. There is a general recognition out there that we are in a period ofmeaningful transition, and that investment is increasingly shifting tolow-carbon energy sources and technologies. There is also no sign that thistrend is going to fade, or that green energy is some kind of fad. In 2008, forexample, an important milestone was hit: more dollars were spent addingrenewable-power capacity to the world’s electricity systems than on fossil fueland nuclear energy sources combined.6 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-6] Renewables, to bemore precise, captured 56 percent of the $250 billion spent on new powercapacity that year. This remained true in Europe and the United States in 2009,and while there will be spurts and sputters along the way, the trend is expectedto hold steady over the coming years.7 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-7]The global Boston Consulting Group (BCG) isn’t exaggerating when it reports thatthere has been an “unprecedented explosion of interest” in alternative energytechnologies during the first decade of the 21st century. Indeed, theconsultancy singled out advanced biofuels and concentrated solar power as twotechnologies in a position to “disrupt the status quo” without the crutch ofsubsidies by 2025. Could these, to borrow a term popularized by author MalcolmGladwell, be tipping points that contribute to more rapid change in the energysector? As BCG pointed out, “Even in the relatively slow-moving energy space,there are cautionary examples of how quickly fundamental assumptions can beoverturned.”8 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-8] Advanced drilling technologies, to name onerecent example, enabled the economic collection of shale gas and changed thefortunes of the natural gas sector in a matter of years.I want to emphasize the use of the word unprecedented above, not to question thehistorical fact that energy transitions are inherently inertial, but to suggestthat the energy transition currently washing over us cannot be directly comparedto transitions of the past. There is something different happening this timearound and much of it is not exaggeration or wishful thinking. It’s real, and ithas momentum. When I started reporting on the energy sector in 2005, I was oneof just a handful of reporters and bloggers who focused on clean energy andgreen technologies, and one of the first in North America to have a column in alarge daily newspaper that was dedicated to the subject. Today, I am but onesmall voice in a sea of dedicated news sites, columns, blogs, Facebook pages,and Twitterers all covering different angles of this clean energy revolution andadvocating for a faster transition away from fossil fuels. We may complain thatthe transition is going too slowly — it can never move fast enough — but lookingback it’s amazing we have come this far so quickly.Across North America, municipalities, states, and provinces are tightening theirbuilding codes, promoting energy efficiency, mandating the use of renewableenergy, supporting the deployment of electric vehicles, and reinventing theirelectricity distribution and transmission systems as smart grids. More than halfthe states in America now mandate a certain percentage of renewable energy intheir electricity mix, while my home province of Ontario, which aims to gocoal-free by 2014, has introduced a Green Energy Act and a feed-in-tariffprogram that is expected to add thousands of megawatts of renewable energycapacity to the grid over the coming years. All of this, again, isunprecedented.Also unprecedented is that most major automakers on the planet — American,Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and European — are coming out with electric cars;General Electric has committed to purchasing 25,000 electric vehicles withinfive years for its own fleet and its customers’ fleets; electric vehiclecharging stations are starting to sprout up at university and corporatecampuses, hotel parking lots, big-box retailers, and airports and areincreasingly operated by a new breed of company selling electrons as a servicethe same way mobile phone companies sell us minutes on their networks. Somethingdifferent is clearly happening here.There is profound change also going on with the U.S. military, America’s largestsingle energy consumer, which must provide electricity to hundreds of basesthroughout the world and fuel to hundreds of thousands of vehicles, aircraft,and ocean-going vessels. The Department of Defense consumes 300,000 barrels ofoil a day, reflecting what Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the joint chiefs ofstaff, described as a “burn it if you’ve got it” mentality once held by thearmy, air force, and navy. “We just held a very conventional view that fuel wascheap, easy, and available, without ever really connecting it to any broadergeopolitical implications,” Mullen told guests at an energy security conferencein fall 2010. “Clearly, that is not the world we’re living in today.”9[e08_TESLA.html#x8-9] The admiral’s comments were sobering. He said climatechange, while it will create a humanitarian crisis, also creates conditions ofhopelessness that can spark more world conflict. On top of that, the cost ofgetting oil to the battlefield is rising and putting soldiers at greater risk.It’s why the U.S. Air Force is testing renewable jet fuel on its A-10CThunderbolt jets and wants half of its fleet of planes to run on a blend ofbiofuels by 2016. The navy, meanwhile, wants to cut its use of non-tacticalpetroleum in half by 2015 and has committed by 2016 to launching a “Great GreenFleet” of battle-ready ships, submarines, and planes that would be fueledentirely by biofuels. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, who once served as ambassador toSaudi Arabia, wants renewable energy to represent half of all power and fuelneeds of both the navy and marines by 2020.10 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-10] Solartechnologies are also expected to play a major role on the ground to reduce thecarbon “bootprint” of military personnel. The army, for example, is building a500-megawatt solar thermal and photovoltaics plant in the Mojave Desert to powerits Fort Irwin base in California.11 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-11] There is no reasonto believe this is just good public relations as part of attempts to clean upthe image of a U.S. war machine, as Admiral Mullen made clear. “This effort isnot merely altruistic. It is essential,” he said. “Failing to secure, develop,and employ new sources of energy or improving how we use legacy energy systemscreates a strategic vulnerability and, if left unaddressed, could threatennational security.”12 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-12] This kind of talk is unprecedented,as are the Pentagon’s commitments to lead the transition to low-carbon energysources.If all of this is encouraging, it pales when measured against the actions of theChinese, which according to the chief economist of the International EnergyAgency are ushering in a “new age in the history of energy.”13[e08_TESLA.html#x8-13] The world’s most populated, fastest-growing, and now mostenergy-consuming nation is an easy target for Conservative politicians in thedeveloped countries of the West, particularly in the United States. Why, theyargue, should America commit through international treaty to reduce its carbonemissions when China has yet to agree to mandatory reductions of its own? Thatargument is a red herring. China represents for many an excuse to do nothing,but the mistake here is to assume that China, by not yet agreeing to mandatoryreductions, is actually doing nothing. Far from it, China recognizes that itsown growth is making it dangerously dependent on imports of coal and oil, andthat its demand for such fossil fuels is driving global prices higher. Thissituation, combined with its concern for local pollution and climate change, hasled China to aggressively embrace renewable energy and clean technologies to theextent that it now represents an imposing economic threat to the United States.In 2009, China surpassed the United States as a top investor in greentechnologies and has quickly emerged as the world’s clean energy powerhouse.14[e08_TESLA.html#x8-14] It is now the world’s top manufacturer of both solar andwind technologies, a position it secured in a matter of years. China’s 12thFive-Year economic plan aims to retain that dominance with ambitious domestictargets for renewable-energy and “green” vehicle development. Population andeconomic growth means that coal-fired power generation will continue to grow,but as a percentage of overall supply it will drop to 63 percent from 72 percentas more renewable sources are added to the mix. China expects to nearlyquadruple its wind power capacity by 2020, though this may be a conservativeestimate. Some experts say a six-fold increase to more than 240 gigawatts ofcapacity is doable. Solar PV installations are expected to increase 20-fold overthe same period to more than 20 gigawatts, an outcome that would significantlydrive down the global cost of solar technologies. China is also going big withelectric vehicles. By 2015 it expects to have a network of 4,000 EV chargingstations, rising to 10,000 stations by the end of the decade. As well, it’swidely expected that Chinese automakers and their technology partners will playa lead role in driving down the cost of vehicle battery technologies.This wouldleave the United States, based on its current trajectory of investment anddeployment, in its dust.15 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-15]It’s no wonder U.S. energy secretary Steven Chu talks about America’s “Sputnikmoment.” The energy race is on whether or not politicians and citizens realizeit. Chu realizes it. Sooner rather than later, America’s survival instinct mustkick into higher gear. Once again, this is all unprecedented. History cannotexplain with accuracy how this future will unfold. But the general direction isincreasingly obvious. “In the next 30 years, we’ll be in the biggest industrialreformation we’ve seen in modern times,” said Nicholas Parker, co-founder andexecutive chairman of the Cleantech Group, an industry research and consultinggroup on the front lines of this reformation. “What we’re seeing evidence ofaround the world is that certain jurisdictions get that this is the new economicspace race.”What I’ve discussed above partly explains why I believe the transition away fromfossil fuels could be faster than energy transitions of the past. This isn’tabout a single form of clean energy taking on entrenched interests behind anestablished global infrastructure of unparalleled scale and influence. Thisisn’t about wind versus coal, biofuels versus oil, electricity versus gasoline,or solar versus natural gas. This is about unprecedented innovation,technological diversity, global competition, information flow, public awareness,environmental degradation, resource depeletion, government policy, militaryinitiative, and concern for national and global security — all of it chiselingaway at the foundation of our carbon-based economy. This is about sand-blastinga wall. This is about a collective consciousness and momentum that can makegiants, no matter how big, fall.Black SwansI may be wrong, of course. We’ve always done a poor job of predicting the futurewhere technologies are concerned, and while I believe the general direction ofour energy transition is right, the pace of change could very well provedisappointing. Forecasting truly is a mug’s game. Outcomes rarely materialize aspredicted, and on the opposite extreme, some events unexpectedly emerge thatbring about rapid change and surprising outcomes. Author and professor NassimNicholas Taleb calls these unexpected events “black swans,” and they canblindside the optimists and the pessimists alike. “Many events have taken placeand new technologies have appeared that lay outside the forecasters’imaginations,” Taleb wrote. “Many more that were expected to take place orappear did not do so.”16 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-16]I am fascinated by this idea of black swans, and how unexpected discoveries orunforeseen innovations can have such dramatic impacts. Nikola Tesla was a blackswan. The future well-being of humanity may depend on one of these rare events,as incremental steps can point us in the right direction but might notultimately get the job done. This book, in many ways, is about the potential forblack swans to emerge from the many thousands of entrepreneurs, inventors,scientists, and engineers dedicating their lives to solving an energy crisisthat is clear and present. It’s about how the possible can unexpectedly emergefrom the impossible, however improbable. Perhaps there is a black cygnet withinthese chapters? “We build toys,” Taleb wrote. “Some of those toys change theworld.”17 [e08_TESLA.html#x8-17]It follows that the more toys we build and explore, the greater the chance of ablack swan emerging. The fact that so much invention and innovation these daysis focused on tapping into clean, economical, abundant, and sustainable forms ofenergy can only improve our odds that disruptive change, should it come, is thechange we desire and need. “I feel that right now in the world there’s a ton ofbright, knowledgeable physicists, scientists, and engineers who are pushingtoward solving these critical energy problems, and I truly think that is goingto save humanity,” said John Paul Morgan, founder of Toronto-based Morgan Solarand inventor of a concentrated solar cell technology that can compete head tohead with coal power. I met Morgan for dinner one evening and, over a beer ortwo, we chatted somewhat philosophically about the need to take risks, toexplore new territory, to remain open minded, but also to aim for positivechange. “If I, and thousands of other people I don’t know and will never meet,all push in this direction of innovating around clean energy, some of us will besuccessful and the world will be better for it,” he said.It truly is a movement. I don’t know about you, but I’m tired of all the doomand gloom. I want something to cheer for, and I want hope for the future of mychildren, and their children, and so on. This book is meant to inspire, givehope, and offer comfort that there is much to cheer for — that humanity isn’tresigned to choking on its own industrial past. Isn’t it incredible andheartening that a small group of passionate individuals in a suburb of Vancouverare trying to crack the nuclear-fusion nut? That a retired mechanical engineerwants to harness energy from man-made tornadoes? That a former jet-fighter pilotis trying to make long-range electric cars a commercial reality? That a seasonedaerospace executive has the audacious vision of collecting solar energy in spaceand beaming it back to Earth? Or that there are individuals out there daring toquestion some laws of physics if it means bettering our life on this planet?We need these risk-takers and visionaries so willing to expand the realm ofpossibility. Not only are they part of that collective consciousness that canmake giants fall, they are the potential black swans who can carry us to thelow-carbon world we need, sooner rather than later. They are the unappreciatedwarriors on the front lines of necessary change, and whether they succeed orfail, we owe them our gratitude. That’s because they succeed by making theattempt — by being mad like Tesla and building the “toys” that expose us tounexpected, disruptive change. And while society’s skepticism and ridicule maybe harsh and biting, it is a crucial condition of their journey. For NikolaTesla, it was the bittersweet fruit of invention, a point he made clear in a1913 letter to financier J.P. Morgan:[It is better] in this present world of ours that a revolutionary idea orinvention, instead of being helped and patted, be hampered and ill-treated inits adolescence — by want of means, by selfish interest, pedantry, stupidity,and ignorance; that it be attacked and stifled, that it pass through bittertrials and tribulations, through the strife of commercial existence. So do wesee our light. So all that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned,combated, suppressed — only to emerge all the more powerfully, all the moretriumphantly from the struggle.Notes:1 [e08_TESLA.html#x8x1] Vaclav Smil, Energy Myths and Realities: BringingScience to Energy Policy (Washington, D.C.: AEI Press, 2010), 59.2 [e08_TESLA.html#x8x2] Vaclav Smil.3 [e08_TESLA.html#x8x3] “Clean Technology Venture Investment Reaches Record $8.4billion in 2008 Despite Credit Crisis and Broadening Recession,” press release,Cleantech Group.

Those are two other important milestones we have yet to meet.8 [e08_TESLA.html#x8x8] Balu Balagopal, Petros Paranikas, and Justin Rose,“What’s Next For Alternative Energy,” The Boston Consulting Group.

Itwas a lengthy process, but I was fortunate to have so many publishers in Torontoopen their doors. ECW Press, located just a short jog from my home in Toronto’sBeaches neighbourhood, turned out an ideal fit in so many ways. I thankco-publisher Jack David for buying into my vision and managing editor CrissyBoylan for what felt like, from my perspective at least, a painless editingprocess. My gratitude extends to the rest of ECW’s team, including Simon Ware,Erin Creasey, and Jennifer Knoch. It was a pleasure working with you all.Whether they knew it or not, many individuals played an important role as thisproject unfolded. First and foremost, a big thank you to my friend GregKiessling, who despite being an ocean away read each chapter as I finished itand offered invaluable feedback and advice. Greg also opened up his professionalnetwork to help me spread the word about Mad Like Tesla. On a subconsciouslevel, I’m sure our past chats over coffee played an early role in inspiringparts of this project. I am also indebted to Jim Balsillie for keeping mefocused. Jim took the time out of his immensely busy schedule to read earlychapters and share his thoughts.Similarly, thank you to Toby Heaps for never turning down an invitation tobrainstorm over a beer. Not only did Toby introduce me to ECW, but our regulardiscussions on energy, sustainability, and green politics helped me to refine myideas and approach to this project. I must also acknowledge my friend JoseEtcheverry for both his personal and professional support, including stickingout his neck to help me when my own efforts failed.There are so many others who deserve my thanks for contributing directly orindirectly to this project. They include Nicholas Parker, who first inspired meto start writing about clean technologies; George Monbiot, who unknowinglyconvinced me to leave my day job and pursue this project as part of a freelancecareer in our first meeting; and the Toronto Star, for embracing my Clean Breakcolumn and giving me the platform on which to write about so many inspiringstories in the energy and technology sectors. Alfred Holden, the best editorI’ve ever worked with at the paper (or anywhere, for that matter), not onlyshared my enthusiasm for these stories but fought for the real estate I neededto tell them properly.It should be emphasized that this book would be empty were it not for the“underdog inventors” and entrepreneurs profiled within its pages. Most opened uptheir doors and their lives, letting me get close enough to do the job I neededto do. My deepest gratitude goes to Michel Laberge, Doug Richardson, GarySpirnak, Cal Boerman, Louis Michaud, Jay Harman, Paul Woods, Ian Clifford, andThane Heins. Many thanks as well to Tom Rand, Vinod Khosla, Eric Mennell, theMorgan brothers, Janine Benyus, Amory Lovins, Rick Whittaker, Vicky Sharpe,Michael Brown, Peter and Eva Glaser, Kerry Emanuel, Michael Blieden, EdBeardsworth, Dave Pascoe, Neil Young, and Dave Toms — not to mention many loyalreaders of my Clean Break blog.And, of course, recognition must go to the man who inspired it all: NikolaTesla.Closer to home, I offer a heartfelt thanks to my family and friends for theirunwavering support. To my parents, Jo-Ann King and Paul Hamilton, and myin-laws, Bill and Denise McMurchie, for your love and encouragement; to mysister, Tracey Boriska, for helping me stay sane when anxiety occasionally setin; and to my brother-in-law, Neil McMurchie, for being my engineer-on-demandand helping me understand often complex technical issues before my brainexploded. The Boriskas, Constantinos, Macs, Eakins, and Turners — I wish I couldhave spent more time with all of you over the past 18 months.Finally, I could not have done this without the support of my dear wife, LyneMcMurchie, and my two smart and heart-achingly beautiful girls, Claire and Ruby.Lyne was not only my unofficial editor; she was my sounding board, my voice ofreason, and my bringer of late-night tea. At the same time, she tolerated mydowns, kept all in order when I needed to dash off for trips, and got the girlsbathed and off to bed many nights while I typed away oblivious to the time.Thank you for your tolerance and love, and for indulging me in this pursuit.As for my little bunnies, as curious as you are, you have had to suffer throughmy ramblings about clean energy, climate change, and ways to lower ourcollective impact on this planet. Even if you were just pretending, thank youfor showing interest in what your old man had to say. My gut, however, tells meyou weren’t pretending, and that delights me to no end."},{"pageContent":"TYLER HAMILTON is an author, adjunct professor, and award-winning energy andtechnology writer for the Toronto Star, where for six years he has been one ofCanada’s leading voices on green technology issues and trends through his weeklycolumn.
