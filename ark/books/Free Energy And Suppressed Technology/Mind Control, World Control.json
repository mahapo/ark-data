Now, in the 20th century, scientists in the pay of governments and other monied interests have made te chnical breakthroughs that render actual mind control feasi ble, and on a nigh-universal scale. Invasive control techniq ues have been fine-tuned to the point where the controllers are literally able to get inside our heads and to command us. The y are able to tinker with our humanness, to manipulate it , to destroy it if they choose. They are able to use hig h tech networks of electronic entrainment and broadcasting whose nature has not even been hinted of in the mass medi a —since the mass media itself is employed in the same manne r, for the manipulation of the populace. Even the subject of m ind control in the media is mentioned only in the conte xt of science fiction, or is derided as the delusions of the crazy \"aluminum foil hat crowd,\" never mind that those gu ys might be on to something.

If th is elite is cold-blooded enough to have calculatedly created wa r, famine, and designer disease, as many suspect they have, what qualms would discourage them from creating worldwid e mind control? This book is meant to portray certain aspects of the history of world mind control, its evolution , and the political currents that have historically dictated its directions. I will not pretend that it is definitive or the las t word on the subject, and it is probably not even the last word I will have to say on the topic. The book is, however, intended to offer perspective on the present day that is rarely provi ded in the controlled mainstream media. I have accessed a wide variety of sources—some mainstream, some controversial—in order to try to g et to the secret programs and influences that have long dicta ted our thinking, our behavior, our welfare. I believe that some, although certainly not all, of those programs and i nfluences have been revealed here, and that this information will assist future researchers in delving into these matters. I have quoted my sources throughout the book, both for the skeptic who disbelieves what I have to say, as well as for the interested reader who would like to research these topics more thoroughly. When I am speculating, as opposed to relying on solid fact, I have tried to make this cl ear. The truth is startling enough without getting into fant asy. Although the subject matter of this book is for the most part unrelievedly grim, I have not intended to crea te inertia, to \"tell how bad it all is\" and to immobilize the r eadership with fear about the horrible state everything is in . My hope is to do just the opposite: to galvanize the reader into action. I have attempted to provide information that may be helpful for taking control back from those who would dictat e our lives, and for that control to be returned to the i ndividual, and I have also provided contact addresses of allie d individuals and groups at the back of the book.

William Howard Taft was inaugurated as 27th p resident of the United States. Mary Pickford, the first film st ar, was featured in silent films by D.W. Griffith. Picasso painted his \"Harlequin,\" and Matisse coined the word \"Cubism.\" The first permanent waves were being worn by beauties as they strolled the streets of London. Behind the scenes in the world, in the industrial b oardrooms, ornate drawing rooms, and in the offices of governm ent other activities, not quite so idyllic, were afoot. For t his was a time of massive, covert consolidation of power by the monie d elite, and the activation of long-term plans of control that w ould affect the world until the present day. This was the time of the creation of the Federal Re serve, the FBI, the institution of the federal income tax in t he United States, and, with the League of Nations, the first stirrings towards a global government. Powerful men were obse ssed by the idea of increasing their power and in advancing the technology of control to enable them to do so, and they were burning the midnight oil to turn those dreams into reality. It was the time of meetings held to brainstorm the New World Order in groups like the Round Table, the Coe fficients Club, the Fabians, and the Skull and Bones society. The New World Order, that term so often bandied about by po liticians and conspiracy writers, is the long-term plan to create a one-world oligarchical government on this planet. It is not r eally in question that such a plan exists—except among those who have not taken the time to study the documentation, or t hose whose interests dictate that it should be denied. 11"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Round Table/City of London financier focus is o ne group behind the New World Order—certainly not the benigh ted lumpens whom they have pretended to champion—and th eir plans for world control have been carried out by th e universities, the bankers, the politicians—wielding in particular a tangle of international intelligence agencies and the psychia tric frontmen who would later be mobilized by such groups as Tavi stock and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Thr oughout this century the members of the Open Conspiracy have bus ied themselves worldwide, spreading the New World Order virus, all in the interest of the domination of the elite. Amazingly enough, the battle plan of the New World Order controllers can be clearly read in the works of a s cience fiction writer, a man who came up from humble beginnings in Britain to hobnob in his adult life with the movers and shaker s of the elite. Herbert George Wells, more than just the latter day Jules Verne that he is presented as in the history books, was h ead of British Intelligence during World War II, and his mistress was Maura Benckendorff, a woman who has been called \"perhaps the Soviet Union's most effective agent-of-influence ever to a ppear on London's political and intellectual stage.\" H.G. We lls knew whereof he spoke when extolling the plans of the Ne w World Order. Wells acted as a publicist for the real planners wh o worked behind the scenes. He was a front man for the Cecil Rhodes Round Table elitist secret society—Rhodes himself a n agent for the Rothschilds' banking conglomerate who left his fortune to Lord Rothschild in his third will. The Round Table later branched out to spawn the influential Council on Fo reign Relations and other groups perhaps not as powerful, but more well known in our time. Wells was an intimate of th e Rothschild-allied Sassoons, who had made their fort une from opium shipping, and he was often seen at Sassoon fe tes attended by the likes of Edward VII, George Bernard Shaw, an d the young Winston Churchill. Rhodes stated in 1890 in a letter to W.T. Stead, \"W hat an awful thought it is that if we had not lost America , or if even now we could arrange with the present members of the Un ited States Assembly and our House of Commons, the Peace of the world is secure for all eternity. We could well hol d your federal parliament five years at Washington and five years at London. The only thing possible to carry this idea out is a secret one (society) gradually absorbing the wealth of th e world to be 12"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"devoted to such an object...\" Elsewhere, Rhodes stated it even more plainly. His objective was: \"The extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system of emigration from the Unite d Kingdom and of colonization by British subjects of all land s wherein the means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labou r and enterprise... and the ultimate recovery of the Unit ed States of America as an integral part of the British Empire.\" Rhodes set out to accomplish this task and, through his own labors and those of his successors, has almost succ eeded. [1] It is a matter of high strangeness that within the pages of books written by H.G. Wells in England in the 1920s and 1930s—one of them science fiction—that the actual f uture battle plans of the controllers jump off the pages with cr ystal clarity. Here is an unmistakably clear picture of the New Wo rld Order, along with a clear statement of its plans. Although H.G. Wells is primarily known for his work s of science fiction, such as The Time Machine (1895), T he Invisible Man (1898), and War of the Worlds (1898), he also w rote a number of works which overtly propagandized for the overthrow of existing nation-states and the creation of a one -world government. These books include The Open Conspiracy : Blueprints for aWorld Revolution (1928), The New Wo rld Order (1940), and The Shape of Things to Come: The Ultima te Revolution (1933). While all of the above books are eye-opening when i t comes to understanding the future as foreseen by the control lers, it is Wells' novel The Shape of Things to Come (and the m ovie he scripted that was based upon it, the title shortene d to Things to Come), that provide the best overall view—past, pre sent, and future—of the New World Order. Again: Interestingly, deceptively, the book is pres ented as a work of science fiction, but within its pages is We lls' best guess of how the New World Order would come to pass, from a 1930s perspective. While primarily a work of propaganda that pushes th e one- world worldview of Wells and other internationalist s during the first half of this century, the book is particularl y revealing in that it also exposes many of the strategies that are to be employed. Wells' introduction to the book is titled, \"The Dre am Book of Dr. Philip Raven.\" In a familiar ploy of the scienc e fiction of the time, the book is introduced as the factual work of a Dr. Raven, a deceased friend of Wells, and a member of the Geneva 13"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Secretariat coyly described as having \"unusual oppo rtunities for forming judgments upon the trend of things.\" Wells maintained that Raven wrote the book using the curious techniq ue of transcribing during his waking hours a book of futu re history that he read during his nightly dreams. This is the fictional vehicle by which Wells sounds the clarion call for the New World Order. The dream book purports to be a work of history, wr itten from the perspective of a citizen of a future Utopi an world-state. Wells terms the book \"a Short History of the World for about the next century and a half and an \"Outline of the Futu re.\" He commences his reverse history with a reiteration of actual events up to his own time, describing how the evolu tion of communications and transportation has brought the h uman race into closer contact than ever before—global village stuff— although he comments that \"Distribution, paper supp ly, and news services had fallen into the hands of powerful groups able and willing to crush out any... inimical schools of public suggestion. They set about stereotyping the publi c mind.\" Not surprisingly Wells places the City of London—th e international center of banking culture—and its fin ancial credit as responsible for knitting together world economic life over the previous hundred years. With these innovations in c ommun- ications and finance, but also with the frustration s and wars inherent (so he says) in the existence of independe nt national states and sovereignties, came about the gradual da wning of the idea of the World-State. Wells muses, \"By this time (1919) there was indeed quite a considerable number of intelligent people in the wo rld who had realized the accumulating necessity of a world gove rnment, and a still larger multitude... who had apprehended it instinctively and sentimentally, but there was no one yet who had the intellectual vigor to attack in earnest the problem of substituting a world system for the existing governments.\" He al so describes a one-world government as \"manifestly the only poss ible solution of the human problem.\" Like many another wealthy individual advocating a o ne-world state for the \"common good,\" Wells did not believe that commoners were capable of running that world-state. He described democracies as exercising \"a political fi ction of a very extraordinary kind: that every subject... was equal ly capable of making whatever collective decisions had to be made .\" And so this New World Order would be run by the few, by th ose upper- 14"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"crust and white racialist Englishmen and their angl ophilic American associates, the men that Wells saw as bein g capable of doing so. Referring in the book to the Versailles Peace Confe rence that followed World War I, Wells points to American Pres ident Woodrow Wilson as being \"the most susceptible to th e intimations of the future... But it is doubtful if at any time he realized that a world pax means a world control of all the vital common interests of mankind.\" Within a litany of bright ideas leading up to the a cceptance of the one-world-state, Wells notes Wilson's abortive League of Nations, precursor to the U.N., but mourns its fail ures and regrets that the League, where \"The World-State had appeared dimly and evasively, as an aspiration, as a remote possibility... had no executive powers, no certain revenues, no ar my, no police, and practically no authority to do anything at all.\" Wells warns the builders of the world-state not to make t hat mistake again. They would not. Wells even indicates the presence of conspiratorial factions involved in the creation of the unified world order during the twentieth century, the sort of men that he cozied u p to in real life in London's exclusive clubs. Wells says that, \"strange Mystery Men were dimly visible through a fog of baf fling evasions and mis-statements, manipulating prices and exchang es. Prominent among these Mystery Men was a certain Mr. Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England from 1920 t o 1935.\" Not surprisingly, this is the same Montagu Norman w ho was a rabid pre-war partisan of Hitler, and who participa ted with Hjalmar Schacht, with American intelligence, with W all Street, and with the Rothschild/Warburg/Schiff banks in the creation of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. \"Another big obsc ure financial force in the war and post-war periods,\" Wells goes on, \"was the complex of great private banking ganglia, of which Morgan and Co., with its associated firms, was the most centra l and most typical.\" Wells marks the transition from the date of his act ual writing of his book, the early 1930s, to his elitist, techn ocratic vision of the future with a section about the coming war—Worl d War II, that is—and what he sees as its terrible aftermath, titled, \"The Days After Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration.\" H.G. Wells was not the only person during the post- World War I period to see that another devastating world war was nearly inevitable. Wells has World War II beginning in 1 940 in Poland, 15"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"over an imagined slight taken by a Nazi over the ac tions of a Pole of Jewish origin. He characterizes World War II as it was, as an orgy of world violence, and has the fighting end in 1949—staying remarkably close to the actual dates of the conflic t—only to be followed by another scourge, that of rampant diseas e, \"The Raid of the Germs.\" Given the present-day climate of AIDS, Ebola, Mad C ow disease, and other resistant viral strains—and the persistent rumors of the military engineering of those same diseases—perhaps Wells' dating in this particular s hould have been moved forward a few years. In Wells' scenario, years of terrible war and disea se result in the near-total disintegration of society. Wells pla ces the final break-up of the nation-states and \"America in Liqui dation\" at 1966, when \"the great patchwork of empires and nati onalist states, set up during the Age of European Predomina nce, lost its defining lines, lost its contrasted cultures and it s elaborated traditions, and ceased to divide the allegiance and devotion of men of goodwill.\" Wells was no prophet as regards his timeline, only a science fiction writer privy to the plans of men with an in terest in promoting the coming of the dictatorial world-state . His crystal ball is somewhat cloudy on certain details. Obvious ly his prediction of the destruction of civilization did n ot come to pass as an immediate result of World War II, although it is easy to see how Wells might not have foreseen the coming nuclea r stalemate which brought about the protracted \"cold war\" between the U.S. and the USSR. Wells places responsibility for the creation of the New World Order in the lap of scientists of the future, the g roup he dubs the \"Technocracy.\" Citing a fictional future book b y an author named DeWindt, he says the New World Order, \"sustai ned by multitude of nuclei on DeWindt's pattern scattered throughout the whole world, very much as the Bolshevik politic al organization had been sustained by the Communist Pa rty, came into existence and spread its ever-growing network about the planet without an immediate struggle. Its revolutio nary nature was understood by few people other than its promote rs.\" Wells dates the formal institution of the Technocra cy—the New World Order, by any other name—at the \"Second Conference of Basra\" in the year 1978. Although his timeline is faulty, the tactics of gradual ideological assimila tion that he describes are time-honored and immortalized in the slogan of 16"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"the Socialist Fabian Society that Wells belonged to : \"Proceed slowly,\" while the thesis-antithesis-synthesis that culminates in the Technocracy is the product of Hegelian thinking . This is the philosophy as well as the method by which the W ellsian vision of the New World Order has come to pass in o ur own time—come to pass in virtually everything but its f ormal institution, and in planetary \"mopping up\" operatio ns. Exactly where did Wells obtain his information of t he plans of the elite? It is interesting that Wells is particul arly fond of the adjective \"illuminating\" when describing an idea he particularly likes, in The Shape of Things to Come. He describes President Wilson's one-worldism as \"one of the most illuminat ing events in the early twentieth century.\" Before a New World Order can be formed, \"scattered flashes of understanding had to ignite a steadier illumination.\" Is this proof of his card-carrying membership in a group linked to the infamous Illuminati secret society, f ounded by the German Weishaupt, and alleged by many to be the pow er behind the institution of the New World Order? Hardly. But it would be a mistake to totally dismiss such clues. The Illumi nati, the Freemasons, members of the Skull and Bones and rela ted and offshoot groups have been particularly fond of what they term \"revelation of method,\" secret handshakes, in-group references, and cant language to reveal their presence to their cohorts and to befuddle the \"profane\" masses. There are solid c onnections between illuminist groups, the Rhodes Roundtable, t he Nazis, British intelligence... and, well, Wells. It is not impossible that Wells is doing just this. Another explicit statement of the intentions of the New World Order can be read in Wells' nonfiction book T he Open Conspiracy, published in 1928. The specific directi ves of Wells' proposed Open Conspiracy program, again identical w ith what has come to be known as the New World Order, were: \"1. The complete assertion, practical as well as th eoretical, of the provisional nature of existing governments and of our acquiescence in them; \"2. The resolve to minimize by all available means the conflicts of these governments, their militant use of individuals and property and their interferences with the estab lishment of a world economic system; \"3. The determination to replace private local or n ational ownership of at least credit, transport, and staple production by a responsible world directorate serving the common ends of the 17"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"race; \"4. The practical recognition of the necessity for world biological controls, for example, of population and disease; \"5. The support of a minimum standard of individual freedom and welfare in the world; \"6. The supreme duty of subordinating the personal life to the creation of a world directorate capable of thes e tasks and to the general advancement of human knowledge, capacit y, and power.\" This is the multiple-pronged New World Order scheme in black and white, and while it sounds pretty good on paper, what it doesn't say is paramount: it is a plan to demoli sh national boundaries and constitutions, and to consolidate co ntrol—total control—in a tiny aristocratic governing body. Gone will be the constitutional safeguards that Americans have come to take for granted—gone will be any safeguards at all, any pro tections whatsoever for the human cogwheels subject to this vast totalitarian scheme. The New World Order plan would later be furthered b y such offshoot groups as the Council on Foreign Relations , the Trilateral Commission, the Club of Rome, the Tavist ock Institute, and the Bilderbergers, and realized in t he form of such institutions as the United Nations, the Internation al Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. None of these groups or t heir individual members have acted entirely on their own , but instead are an evolving hydra with many heads. Thei r actions have always been coordinated in a unified manner, a nd their shared objective has always been total control of t he world. [2] NOTES: 1.

[1] In these early years of the 20th century, British R ound Table controllers and—acting at a command level in the U. S.— members of the German-spawned Skull and Bones socie ty, worked in concert with the Rockefellers and others to pour huge sums of money into American and German coffers for the research of psychiatry, psychiatric genetics, eugen ics, euthanasia, and other means of controlling and \"per fecting\" what they conceived of as an otherwise imperfect hu man race, at least in terms acceptable to the elite. Although it may seem obvious, political and economi c imperialism are almost always linked to an imperial ism of the mind. In the early 20th century, embryonic studies of biology, eugenics, and the human mind were massively funded to be utilized, not for the overall improvement of the hu man condition, but for domination of the many by the fe w, for the \"good\" of the State. Skull and Bones is the Yale-based American chapter of a German secret society that is in all probability li nked to the famous Illuminati, founded on May 1, 1776, by Adam Weishaupt, Professor of Canon Law at the University of Ingolst adt, and referred to internally as \"The Order.\" Samuel Russell was the founder of Russell and Compa ny, that shipped opium from Turkey to China in the 19 th century. 19"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Numerous of the dominant \"Eastern Establishment\" fa milies in American affairs to the present day made their fort une in opium shipping. Russell bought out the Perkins Syndicate in 1830, that had previously dominated the American opium sh ipping market. Among Russell's employees were Warren Delan o, Jr. (the grandfather of Franklin Delano Roosevelt), Joh n Cleve Greene (who financed Princeton University), and Jos eph Coolidge (his son was the organizer of the United F ruit Company, alleged to be Mafia-associated and involve d in drug smuggling, while his grandson was one of the co-fou nders of the Council on Foreign Relations). The American Skull and Bones group was founded in 1 833 at Yale University by Samuel Russell's cousin, General William Huntington Russell, and Alphonso Taft. In 1831-32 R ussell studied in Germany, at that time a hotbed of the He gelian/ Prussian system that declared the jackbooted state as supreme and the individual as merely a cell in the greater organism. While in Germany, Russell apparently was contacted by the Bavarian Illuminati or an offshoot group. Skull and Bones was incorporated in the U.S. in 1856, as the Russell Tr ust, and like the Illuminati is also known as \"The Order.\" Intern al documentation of Skull and Bones places the beginni ngs of its German predecessor group at about the time that the Illuminati was suppressed by the Bavarian Elector. [2] \"The Order [Skull and Bones],\" according to histori an Antony C. Sutton, \"has either set up or penetrated just ab out every significant research, policy, and opinion-making or ganization in the United States, in addition to the Church, busin ess, law, government and politics. Not all at the same time, but persistently and consistently enough to dominate th e direction of American society. The evolution of American soci ety is not, and has not been for a century, a voluntary develop ment reflecting individual opinion, ideas and decisions at the grass roots. On the contrary, the broad direction has bee n created artificially and stimulated by The Order.\" [3] Part of the New World Order plan, reflected in the views of the people who have promoted it, has always been eu genics: the elimination of \"useless eaters\" and \"inferior races \" who are seen only as an impediment in the road of the almig hty State.

The controllers, naturally, would not be so burdene d by hardship, but would serenely float above society li ke members of Wells' Technocracy, skimming the cream. Eugenics as a subject had been disseminated by the English psychologist Francis Galton, beginning in 1883. Aga in seeing the State rather than the individual as the supreme measure of man, and taking off from Darwin's theory of natural selection, Galton proposed that, through selective interventio n through breeding programs and the suppression of less desir able breeding stock, society might be brought up to an o verall higher condition. In 1904 the University College in London establishe d the first chairs in Eugenics and Eugenics in Working Society in London. This led to the creation of the Galton Laboratory f or National Eugenics in 1907. The ideas of eugenics, euthanasia , and sterilization for those judged inferior were hearti ly supported in London, specifically by the \"upper crust\" of the po pulace who were eager to do something about the bothersome low er classes. Eugenics philosophy and programs were soon received with approval worldwide, however, including in America. In 1911, when Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis ordered Standard Oil broken up, John D. Rockefeller, the fi rst American to amass a billion dollars in assets—equivalent to roughly one hundred billion dollars today—responded by starting the Rockefeller Foundation. The at-the-time astronomica l sum of $300 million was transferred into the account of th e foundation, and administered by trustees who were family member s and employees of the family. John D. Rockefeller had, in the 1860s, started on h is way in the oil business with a boost of British capital. R ockefeller was soon notorious for using violent methods for increa sing his wealth. In The Robber Barons, Matthew Josephson tal ks about those methods: \"Where the Standard Oil company could not carry on its expansion by peaceful means, it was ready with viol ence; its faithful servants knew even how to apply the modern weapon of dynamite. In Buffalo, the Vacuum Oil Co., one of th e 'dummy' creatures of the Standard Oil system, became distur bed one day by the advent of a vigorous competitor who built a sizable refinery and located it favorably upon the waterfro nt. The offices of Vacuum conducted at first a furtive campaign of intimidation. Then emboldened or more desperate, they approached the chief 21"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"mechanic of the enemy refinery, holding whispered c onferences with him in a rowboat on Lake Erie.

And th en if you would give them a little scare, they not knowing anything about the business. You know how...\" The foreman's reward wou ld be a lifelong annuity, and \"in due time a small explosio n took place in the independent plant.\" [4] The Rockefellers also used more sophisticated forms of espionage. John D.'s brother William Rockefeller em ployed in his business a British intelligence officer named C laude Dansey who, prior to World War I, had been involved in reo rganizing the U.S. Army intelligence service. Dansey's protege Ge neral Marlborough Churchill, a relative of Winston Church ill, was given the task of organizing and directing the American i ntelligence services. After the war, Churchill ran the \"Black C hamber,\" an espionage group with stated allegiance to the State Department and the U.S. Army, but with implicit servitude to t he New York monied elite. General Churchill was also responsibl e for creating the Macy Foundation, which would later be a major conduit for the funding of the CIA's MKULTRA mind c ontrol research of the 1950s and later. In order to change his image as the most despised blackguard of the era, John D. Rockefeller took on the services of Ivy Lee, the top advertising man of the day. Lee suggested that Rockefeller start giving away large amounts of cash. Lee was still in the employ of the Rockefellers when, in th e 1930s, he was given the specific assignment by Standard Oil P resident Walter C. Teagle and Hermann Schmitz of the German I.G. Farben company to supply intelligence on America's reaction to the Nazis, and to concoct and disseminate pro-Germa n propaganda to the Americans. This was no fluke. Roc kefeller holdings, including Standard Oil, were extensively intertwined with those of the Nazis, and contact and commerce—i ncluding shipments of oil—continued throughout World War II. [5] Relations with Germany were not so inflamed when Rockefeller monies funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Instit ute for Psychiatry in Munich, Germany (initially endowed by the Krupp munitions manufacturing family, and James Loeb, bro ther-in-law of Paul Warburg, the architect of the Federal Reser ve in America), to the tune of 11 million marks. The Rock efeller Foundation, in 1925, also provided a grant of $2.5 million to the 22"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Institute, and furnished other large grants to the institution throughout the Hitler era. Also funded by the Rockefellers was the Kaiser Wilh elm Institute for Anthropology, Eugenics, and Human Her edity. These institutions were run by Swiss psychiatrist E rnst Rudin, who was assisted by Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer an d Franz J. Kallmann. [6] James Loeb was a relative of the Warburg banking fa mily, key among the elite controllers in London, and a busine ss partner of William Rockefeller. The Rockefellers and the Warbu rgs had initially bankrolled the pivotal American Harriman family in their enterprises, channeling monies provided by Si r Ernst Cassell, banker to the British royals. The Rockefel lers, the Warburgs, and the Harrimans are familiar faces, app earing again and again during the creation of the primary social control mechanisms of this century, including eugenics and psychiatric mind control. These families acted in collusion with the Round Ta ble groups founded by Cecil Rhodes, himself a Freemason and operative of the Rothschild banking family, as well as the Skull and Bones society in America. Although the Rhodes Round Table groups were origina lly financed primarily by the Rhodes Trust, since 1925 substantial funding has been provided by the Carnegie United Ki ngdom Trust, whose first president (1902-05) was Bonesman Daniel Coit Gilman—a man key in the subversion of American education—and organizations associated with J.P. Mo rgan, the Rockefellers, the Whitneys, and the Lazards. Factually, one of the New World Order's early proje cts was the creation of the Third Reich. Nazism, in fact, d iffers very little from the New World Order philosophy except i n its emphasis on German nationalism. After Hitler's ascent to chancellorship in 1933, sp onsored by many of the men who lusted after a New World Order, psychiatric institutes controlled by Ernst Rudin we re incorporated into the Nazi machine. Rudin became he ad of the Racial Hygiene Society, and Rudin and his staff, in the Task Force on Heredity chaired by SS chief Himmler, inst ituted the German sterilization law, based upon existing Ameri can laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Far from being an anomaly of the Nazi regime, the h orrific eugenics and psychiatric programs instituted in Ger many during this time were only a reflection of studies and p roposals that 23"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"were in vogue in Europe and America. It has only re cently been revealed that thousands of persons deemed physicall y or morally unfit continued to be sterilized after World War II —until the middle 1970s—in Sweden, France, Denmark, Finland, a nd other European countries. Hitler's Reich, however, provid ed a political climate in which eugenics plans could ach ieve a particularly ghastly fruition. Otmar Vershuer, assistant to Ernst Rudin and the di rector of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Euge nics, and Human Heredity in Berlin, was in turn assisted by a name more familiar to us: Josef Mengele. Vershuer procured fu nds for Mengele's inhuman research programs at Auschwitz. T here, many arrivals at the camp filled out questionnaires from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, before a wide variety of frankensteinian experimentation was performed on them. Thousands we re tortured and murdered, with body parts shipped to t he Rockefeller-financed Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Mengele was captured and identified in an Allied pr isoner of war camp in 1945, and although his captors knew the nature of his crimes at Auschwitz, he was released. His organ izational senior Vershuer also eluded punishment; he was simp ly hired by a Rockefeller-funded eugenics organization, the Bur eau of Human Heredity in Denmark. Rudin's assistant Kallma n testified on Rudin's behalf at de-Nazification proc eedings, and both men were later involved in the creation of the American Society of Human Genetics, which later organized th e currently high profile and highly subsidized Human Genome pro ject that may turn the description of mankind as sheep into m ore than a metaphor. In 1936 another player became apparent in the field of psychiatric genetics and mind control experimentati on, one hardly whispered of in other exposes of the subject : the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. The Scottish Rite's loyalties are and have always been with the New World Order vision of one- world government, and the loyalties of at least a certain faction of the men promoting the New World Order have always been to Freemasonry. Glimmerings of the New World Order str ategy can in fact be traced back to the days of their predece ssor Rosicrucians—not to be confused with the mailorder AMORC currently seen in UFO and psychic magazines—and suc h early works as Bacon's New Atlantis. In 1936, Dr. Nolan D.C. Lewis, the Scottish Rite's Field Representative of Research on Demential Praecox ( incurable 24"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"insanity), and director of the New York State Psych iatric Institute, was overseeing 14 projects funded by the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite Northern Supreme Counc il. At the time of these Freemasonic psychiatric projects, the Duke of Connaught, son of the German Coburg Prince Albert a nd Queen Victoria, and brother to Nazi sympathizer King Edwa rd VII, was the grand master of the \"Mother Grand Lodge\" in Eng land. He was also linked to a racialist \"shadow government\" called the Broederbond that, according to the Philadelphia Inq uirer, ruled South Africa until recent times, and was only expos ed in the 1990s. Although very little information is available on th ese Freemasonic psychiatric projects, details on one pr ovide a telling conjunction between the Freemasons and the Nazis. A protege of Nazi eugenics head Ernst Rudin, psychiat rist Franz J. Kallmann, was forced from his job in Germany when h e was discovered to be half Jewish. Kallmann's character can be gauged by the fact that he had argued at the Intern ational Congress for Population Science in Berlin in 1935 t hat, not only should schizophrenics be sterilized, but the same m utilation should also be performed on their apparently health y relatives. Kallmann moved to New York and smoothly transitione d into being the director of research at the New York Stat e Psychiatric Institute, an institution headed by the Freemasons' Dr. Lewis. Kallmann was paid by the Scottish Rite of Freemason ry to study 1,000 schizophrenics to prove that mental illness w as inherited genetically. The study was published in the U.S. an d in Germany in 1938. The preface to the study thanked the Scott ish Rite and Rudin. Kallman's report was used as part of the sci entific justification for a program launched by the Nazi's infamous T4 Unit, named after its address, Tiergartenstrasse 4, Berlin. Operatives of T4 were reportedly responsible for mu rdering over 200,000 mental defectives. [7] NOTES: 1. Knuth, E.C., The Empire of the City. (The Noontide Press, 1983) 2.

It's fascinating t hat Wundt's grandfather is mentioned in the Illuminati Provinci al Report from Utica (Heidelberg) of September 1782, as being the member known as \"Raphael.\" [1] During the period before Wundt's ascendancy in the field, psychology was considered to be, simply enough, the study of the soul or mind (psyche). Wundt was to change all that, defining and propagandizing for the materialistic v iewpoint that would disinform the work of successors like Pavlov, Skinner, and Watson. Wundt took a chair in philosophy at the University of Leipzig in 1875, establishing the world's first psychologic al laboratory, creating the psychological journal Philosophical St udies, and redefining psychology for this century. Wundt state d with characteristic modesty, \"The work which I here pres ent to the public is an attempt to mark out a new domain in sc ience.\" Wundt was to remain at the University of Leipzig un til his death in 1920. Wundt's doctrine might be characterized as science meets the Hegelian sturm und drang. One of the primary un der- pinnings of the New World Order is that its strateg y for world conquest originates in the philosophy of Hegel. Heg el was a professor of philosophy at the University of Berlin , and his works formed the basis for both Marxist dialectical materialism and fascist Statism. 27"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Hegel's stated belief was that Man is subordinate t o the State, and only finds fulfillment in obedience to the dikt ats of the State. As he said, \"The State is the absolute reali ty and the individual himself has objective existence, truth a nd morality only in his capacity as a member of the State.\" Thi s philosophy can be and has been used for the justification of a ny number of atrocities committed upon the human race, and provi des an unexamined sub-stratum to the philosophies of many politicians today. If only the omelette (the State) is importan t, what does it matter if we lose a few million eggs (humans) in th e process of cooking up the dish? Hegel was the originator of the theory of the \"dial ectic,\" the idea that conflict determines history. According to Hegel, a force (thesis) dictates its own opposing force (ant ithesis). These forces in conflict result in the creation of a third force: a synthesis. Out of this synthesis the process begins again. Marx later revised the theory of the dialectic, insistin g that only material events were relevant, and that the dialect ic was inherent in matter, thus divorcing the idea from me taphysics, at least to his own satisfaction. From the theory of the dialectic comes the realizat ion that the creation of conflicts can create determined out comes, or syntheses. Those who promote the New World Order, a gain and again, are seen to be using the theory of the Hegel ian dialectic to bring it about. They are manipulating events, creat ing conflicts, creating wars, and destroying the lives of untold m illions in the bargain. The New World Order is the desired synthes is of the controlling forces operant in the world today. Naturally, the Hegelian system goes completely agai nst the grain of most people, particularly in the West, who view the individual as the true sovereign. Thus the real ene mies are not America vs. the Soviets, or the political Left vs. the Right, but those who would manipulate the yin and yang of hist ory. To return to Wundt: Like Marx, he maintained that u nless a thing could be scientifically quantified, there was no point in considering it or including it as a factor in scien tific investigation. All psychological studies should be based upon physiology: body reactions. Wundt essentially redef ined psychological studies as studies of the brain and n ervous system, and redefined man as an animal without a soul, thus legitimizing at least for his associates and their employers the treating of man as such. This, no doubt, was a welcome rational ization for the controllers who could now happily slaughter who mever they 28"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"pleased without fear of ultimate spiritual retribut ion or accounting. Wundt said, \"it truly appears to be a useless waste of energy to keep returning to such aimless discussions about the nature of the psyche, which were in vogue for a while, and practically still are, instead, rather, of applying one's energ ies where they will produce real results.\" According to researcher Paolo Lionni, \"For Wundt, w ill was the direct result of the combination of perceived s timuli, not an independent, individual intention as psychology and philosophy had, with some notable exceptions, held up to that time.\" Wundt's rejection of the intangibles of life, such as soul, mind, and free will, have influenced psychiatry and psychology up to the present day. And now you know why shrinks look so weird and often have nervous tics. They have been t aught that they do not have a soul. [2] According to one chronicler of the history of psych ology, after Wundt's theories became popular, \"Naturally Leipzig became the Mecca of students who wished to study the 'new' psychology—a psychology that was no longer a branch of speculative philosophy, no longer a fragm ent of the science of physiology, but a novel and daring and e xciting attempt to study mental processes by the experiment al and quantitive methods common to all science. For the p sychology of Leipzig was, in the eighties and nineties, the n ewest thing under the sun. It was the psychology for bold young radicals who believed that the ways of the mind could be mea sured and treated experimentally—and who possibly thought of themselves, in their private reflections, as pioneers on the ne west frontier of science, pushing its method into reaches of experie nce that it had never before invaded. At any rate they threw th emselves into their tasks with industry and zest. They becam e trained introspectionists and, adding introspection to the resources of the physiological laboratories, they attempted the minute analysis of sensation and perception. They measured reaction- times, following their problems into numerous and w idespread ramifications. They investigated verbal reactions, thus extending their researches into the field of associ ation. They measured the span and the fluctuations of attention and noted some of its more complex features in the 'complicat ion experiment,' a laboratory method patterned after th e situation that gave rise to the astronomer's problem of the ' personal equation.' In their studies of feeling and emotio n they recorded 29"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"pulse-rates, breathing rates, and fluctuations in m uscular strength, and in the same connection they developed methods of recording systematically and treating statistica lly the impressions observed by introspection. They also de veloped the psychophysical methods and in addition made constan t use of resources of the physiological laboratory. And thro ughout all their endeavors they were dominated by the concepti on of a psychology that should be scientific as opposed to speculative; always they attempted to rely on exact observation, experimentation, and measurement. Finally when they left Leipzig and worked in laboratories of their own—chi efly in American or German universities—most of them retain ed enough of the Leipzig impress to teach a psychology that, whatever the subsequent development of the individual's thought, bore traces of the system which was recognized at Leipzig as or thodox.\" [3] The essence of Wundt's research was that man was a machine, albeit a soft one. Wundt also went along w ith the Hegelian axiom that man was simply a cog in the gre ater machine of the State. Was it just a coincidence tha t Wundt and his cohorts, funded by and working with the Prussia n military and political establishment, provided the justifica tion for treating humanity as individual pieces of nearly va lueless machinery, to be tinkered with or destroyed at will ? Wundt, along with other Hegelians, rejected the mor al equation in dealing with mankind—thereby putting ma n in a test tube—and by doing so opened the door to many of the atrocities that followed in this century, including the horror s of mind control. Another mainstay in the arsenal of elitist mind control research was the work of Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, who studied physiology at Leipzig in 1884, five years after Wun dt had a laboratory there, and first worked at the St. Peter sburg Military Medical Academy in Russia. In 1906 Pavlov cut holes in dogs' cheeks and inserted tubes to measure salivation. A bell was rung just before food was given to the dogs, and after a period of time it was observed that the ringing of the bell alone would increase the rate of the dogs' salivation. The observation that responses could be so precisel y conditioned was then brainstormed to apply to the m ental processes of humans—and Pavlov's successors, the sh rinks and social controllers, have continued ringing their be lls, selectively keeping us drooling ever since. [4] Shortly after Pavlov was driving dogs crazy in Russ ia, John B. Watson at Johns Hopkins University—the Hegel hotbed for the 30"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"United States—was doing the same thing to humans. W atson, the founder of what is known as the behaviorist sch ool of psychology—but is really only research following in the dark shadow of Wundt—believed that complex forms of beha vior could be programmed into humans. He conducted one experim ent in which a young boy, \"Little Albert,\" was given a whi te rat to play with. After the boy became accustomed to the rat, W atson would beat on the floor with a steel bar every time the r at was brought in. The boy was understandably terrified by such lu natic behavior, and eventually reacted with terror every time the rat was given to him, and finally, whenever any small f urry animal was around him. Dr. Watson himself drooled over the possibilities o f this kind of mechanical conditioning of human beings: \"Give m e the baby, and I'll make it climb and use its hands in constru cting buildings of stone or wood... I'll make it a thief, a gunman or a dope fiend. The possibilities of shaping in any dir ection are almost endless... Men are built, not born.\" Watson later became a highly successful advertising executive, although there are no records available of what happened to Little Albert . [5] In the late 1930s, Harvard psychologist Burrhus Fre derick (B.F.) Skinner, an unapologetic student of Wundt's theories, and a member of U.S. Army intelligence, fine-tuned the art of human control into what he termed \"operant conditioning,\" becoming a guru to generations of mind shapers that followed . His simple (and quite familiar, by this time) notion was that the reinforcement of a repeated negative stimulus (puni shment) or positive stimulus (reward) formed the basis for lea rned behavior. Skinner's early experiments produced pigeons that c ould dance, do figure eights, and play table tennis. His experiments did not stop with pigeons. Skinner's most famous invention, aimed at producing a \"socialized child,\" was the environmentally control led \"Skinner box,\" a crib-sized container into which he put scor es of children, including his own. His ultimate aim was n ot only to control the behavior of isolated persons, but to ga in insights into how to control society as a whole. [6] Skinner's most explicit statement of his philosophy , ultimately one of world control, is contained in hi s book Walden Two. written in 1948. The book describes a perfect communist utopia run along behaviorist lines. In Walden Two society is run by Frazier, a straw ma n designed to dramatize Skinner's belief s about human 31"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"conditioning. Below Frazier in the pigeon-pecking o rder are six Planners, who in turn run Managers, who are held re sponsible for the \"controlees\" who perform the menial tasks o f daily life. Members of the Walden Two society follow a puritani cal \"Code of Conduct,\" that applies to virtually every aspect of day-to-day life, including the forbidding of midnight snacks. Educat ion is a subset of \"human engineering,\" and children are tur ned over to the group by the parents. \"Home is no place to rais e children,\" drawls Frazier, his philosophy one that has seeming ly been adopted by many current-day shrinks and social work ers. The essence of Walden Two is the application of pos itive and negative reinforcement to create a smoothly running state, free of such unwanted encumbrances as crime and choice. Skinner followed up his vision of Walden Two in 197 1, with his vastly hyped nonfiction book Beyond Freedom and Dignity, awarded the honor of being the most important book of the year by the New York Times. \"What is needed is more cont rol, not less,\" Skinner reminded us. [7] It may be revelatory that throughout his life, Skin ner was interested in mechanical contraptions, even working for years on a perpetual motion machine. His view of the comp osition of human beings was no less mechanical—a vision which characterizes the philosophies of most psychiatrist s to this day. This atheist/materialistic viewpoint, again, provid es a justification for the atrocities which are daily co mmitted in the name of science: How can it be unethical to tinker with, or even destroy a human, if in fact he is really only a mac hine? With B.F. Skinner, the philosophy of psychosocial c ontrol was finely honed. Although many psychologists today ins ist that the behaviorist's vision of a controlled world is crude and outdated, and that a docile society cannot be engineered by s cience, they protest too much. The behaviorist doctrine—forecast by Hegel, invented by Wundt, and fostered by a legion of foll owers in science and education—is firmly in place in the hal ls of academia and in the offices of population-shaping worldwide, and are being applied at every level of society. The elite could not be happier if the whole world was placed in a Skinner box. 32"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"NOTES: 1.

One of the major world arenas in which Hegelian phi losophy and the materialistic anti-psychology of Wundt has been applied is that of education. In 1819 in Prussia the first compulsory schooling f or children was instituted. According to educator John Taylor Gatto, society in Prussia was divided \"into childre n who will become policy makers; children who will become assi stants to policy makers (the engineers, architects, lawyers, and doctors); and the children who will be the vast, massed, used . \"Prussia sets up a three-tier school system, in whi ch one half of one percent of the population is taught to think . They go to school called academie. Five and a half percent of the population go to Realschulen, where they partially learn to think, but not completely, because Prussia believed their defeat at the hands of Napoleon was caused by people think ing for themselves at times of stress on the battlefield. T hey were going to see to it that scientifically this couldn' t happen. The lowest 94%, (that's some pyramid, right?) went to v olkschulen, where they were to learn harmony, obedience, freedo m from stressful thinking, how to follow orders. They work ed out a system that would in fact guarantee such results. I n the volkschulen, it was to divide whole ideas (which re ally simultaneously participate in math, science, social thinking, language and art) into subjects which hardly had ex isted before, to divide the subjects further into units; to divid e the time into small enough units of time. With enough variations in the course of a day, no one would know what was going on.\" [1] In the middle of the last century a member of the s ecret Skull and Bones society, following in the Prussian tradition, set 35"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"in motion an American educational revolution that h as subverted the entire system toward the goals of the New World Order. That man was Daniel Coit Gilman, first president of Johns Hopkins University and of the Carnegie Institution. Gilman studied Hegelian philosophy at the University of Be rlin in 1854- 55. Also at the University of Berlin during this ti me was the earlier mentioned Wilhelm Wundt, who was key in app lying Hegelian-styled psychology to the world. Gilman came from a family of Bonesmen and, after he returned from Germany, in 1856 became treasurer of Skull and Bones. Simultaneously, Gilman became assistant libr arian at Yale, and was appointed to the position of head lib rarian two years later. During the same period Skull and Bones covertly too k over the administration of Yale University, with the pre sidency of the school from that period forward turned over to a su ccession of illuminized Bonesmen. According to The Iconoclast ( October 13, 1873), \"They have obtained control of Yale. Its business i s performed by them. Money paid to the college must p ass into their hands, and be subject to their will. No doubt they are worthy men in themselves, but the many whom they lo oked down upon while in college, cannot so far forget as to give money freely into their hands. Men in Wall Street c omplain that the college comes straight to them for help, instea d of asking each graduate for his share. The reason is found in a remark made by one of Yale's and America's first men: 'Few will give but Bones men, and they care far more for their society than they do for the college.' The Woolsey Fund has but a strugg ling existence, for kindred reasons... Here, then, appea rs the true reason for Yale's poverty. She is controlled by a f ew men who shut themselves off from others, and assume to be t heir superiors...\" Gilman met with Frederick T. Gates, who ran Rockefe ller's foundations, and he implored him to set up the Sout hern Educational Board, merging the Slater and Peabody f unds. Gilman called the foundation the General Education Board—signaling his intentions. The organization wa s later renamed The Rockefeller Foundation. [2] Gilman was the first president of Johns Hopkins Uni versity, and he carefully chose for the faculty members from the Skull and Bones and other groups of the Hegelian stripe. Among those was G. Stanley Hall, the first of Wundt's Ame rican students 36"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"to make a mark. Hall's training in Leipzig was paid for by a loan from a member of Scroll & Key, sister society to Sk ull and Bones at Yale. In Leipzig, Hall immersed himself in Hegel ian-inspired psychological studies taught by materialist psychol ogists like Hartmann, Helmholtz, and his greatest influence, Wu ndt. Returning to America in 1883, he took over the psyc hological laboratory at the new Johns Hopkins, and started th e American Psychological Association and the American Journal of Psychology. According to Hall, \"The psychology I taught was alm ost entirely experimental and covered for the most part the material that Wundt had set forth in the later and larger edition of Physiological Psychology.\" [3] In 1889 Hall was chosen as the first president of t he newly established Clark University in Worcester, Massachu setts. Hall was the mentor of one of the most influential names in American education of this century: John Dewey. Dewey studied under Hall at Johns Hopkins, moving o n to teach at the universities of Michigan and Minnesota . Another major influence upon Dewey was the Hegelian philoso pher George Sylvester Morris, who had received his docto rate from the University of Berlin. According to Dewey, echoi ng the sentiments of his Prussian mentors, \"There is no god, and there is no soul. There are n o needs for the props of traditional religion. \"With dogma and creed excluded, then immutable trut h is also dead and buried. \"There is no room for fixed, natural law or permane nt moral absolutes.\" [4] Dewey published the first American textbook on Hege lian philosophy as applied to the Wundtian psychological innovations in his book Psychology. In 1895 he joined the facul ty at the Rockefeller-funded University of Chicago, heading t he philosophy, psychology, and teaching departments, a nd establishing an education laboratory called the Dew ey School, later known as the Laboratory School of the Univers ity of Chicago. Dewey followed the Wundtian example in his insisten ce that education was not the teaching of mental skills suc h as reading and writing, but in the channeling of raw experienc es to the evolving mind of the child; a sort of psychic Skinn er's box version of education. The traditional role of the t eacher as educator was replaced by the teacher as shrink, socializer, 37"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"eugenicist and herald of the coming world superstat e. Dewey believed that the purpose of public schools w as to \"take an active part in determining the social orde r of the future... according as the teachers align themselve s with the newer forces making for social control of economic forces.\" [5] Dewey also remarked that \"The school is primarily a social institution. Education being a social process, the school is simply that form of community life in which all tho se agencies are concentrated that will be most effective in bri nging the child to share in the inherited resources of the race, an d to use his own powers for social ends. Education, therefore, i s a process of living and not a preparation for future living.\" [6] For Dewey, the issue was always how the child relat ed to the State, rather than how the State related to the chi ld. Another student of Wundt, who was to prove to be pe rhaps the most successful popularizer of the new psycholo gy that abolished the psyche, was James McKeen Cattell. Cat tell was Wundt's assistant in Leipzig in the years 1883-86, receiving his Ph.D. from the grand old man in 1886. Lecturing in Cambridge in 1887, Cattell met and was converted to Social Da rwinism by Darwin's cousin, the English psychologist Francis G alton, the man responsible for the popularization at the begin ning of this century of the science of eugenics and selective br eeding. In 1887 Cattell established at the University of Pe nnsylvania a psychological laboratory of the Wundtian mold, then moved on in 1891 to head the new psychology department at Colum bia University. Cattell was tremendously influential in disseminating the new overtly materialistic psychology, and did s o by establishing a host of magazines, including The Psy chological Review, Science, Scientific Monthly, and School and Society. He also published reference works including America n Men of Science, Leaders in Education, and The Directory of American Scholars, an effective strategy for screwing Wundti an-school psychologists into the mainstream of American thoug ht. Another of Cattell's questionable feats was the abo lition of the use of phonics methods for teaching reading. Cattel l popularized the \"Look-Say\" method of teaching reading, a techni que that according to some sources had been invented by Thom as Hopkins Gallaudet for teaching the deaf. Although G allaudet was not a member of Skull and Bones, two of his sons at tended Yale and were initiated into the secret society. Following upon the insight of Gallaudet in teaching the deaf, Cattell came to the conclusion that the direct memo rization of 38"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"words would increase literacy if applied to normal students. Experience in subsequent years has not proven this to be the case, obviously, and one byproduct of Cattell's adv ocacy of the \"Look-Say\" theory is that as we approach the 21st c entury millions of American adults cannot read or write at all. The whole story about Gallaudet may in fact be a sa nitization of what actually happened. Educator John Taylor Gat to attributes the \"Look-Say\" method to the Prussian sy stem of schooling, where this system of not-teaching-readin g was used essentially to disadvantage all but the privileged class. Gatto says, \"So they figured out that by replacing the al phabet system of teaching reading we teach sounds. (The Prussian System was a whole sentence system, rather than a whole word s ystem. You memorize whole sentences.) If they could get the ki ds and keep them from reading well for the first six and seven years, then it didn't matter after that. They had broken the link between printed information.\" [7] Possibly the most effective Trojan horse for inject ing the Wundtian theory of man-as-machine into the American educational establishment was an individual, James Earl Russell, who studied under and received his doctorate from W undt in 1894. Russell became dean of the New York College f or the Training of Teachers, which he would run for thirty years while heavily weighting its faculty with practitioners of the Wundtian school, at the same time turning it into the larges t institution for the training of teachers in the country. Another luminary in the shrink-wrapping of American education was Edward Lee Thorndike, who studied wit h Wundtians Armstrong and Judd at Wesleyan University , graduat- ing in 1895. Thorndike moved on to Columbia Univers ity, where he specialized in studying animals in \"puzzle box\" mazes, finally finding his niche at Teachers College under Russell. According to Thorndike, teaching was \"The art of gi ving and withholding stimuli with the result of producing or preventing certain responses. In this definition the term stim ulus is used widely for any event which influences a person,—for a word spoken to him, a look, a sentence which he reads, t he air he breathes, etc. etc. The term response is used for a ny reaction made by him, —anew thought, a feeling of interest, a bodily act, any mental or bodily condition resulting from the s timulus. The aim of the teacher is to produce desirable and prev ent undesirable changes in human beings by producing an d preventing certain responses. The means at the di sposal of the 39"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"teacher are the stimuli which can be brought to bea r upon the pupil, —the teacher's words, gestures, and appearan ce, the condition and appliances of the school room, the bo oks to be used, and objects to be seen, and so on through a l ong list of the things and events which the teacher can control.\" [ 8] Thorndike further stated, \"Studies of the capacities and interests of young c hildren indicate the advisability of placing little emphasi s before the age of six upon either the acquisition of those intelle ctual resources known as the formal tools —reading, spelling, arith metic, writing, etc. —or upon abstract intellectual analys is... \"Despite rapid progress in the right direction the program of the average elementary school is too narrow and aca demic in character. Traditionally the elementary school has been primarily devoted to teaching the fundamental subje cts, the three R's, and closely related disciplines... Artif icial exercises, like drills on phonetics, multiplication tables, an d formal writing movements, are used to a wasteful degree. Subjects such as arithmetic, language, and history include content t hat is intrinsically of little value. Nearly every subject is enlarged unwisely to satisfy the academic ideal of thoroughn ess. That the typical school overemphasizes instruction in these formal, academic skills as a means of fostering intellectua l resources... is a justifiable criticism... Elimination of unessenti als by scientific study, then, is one step in improving the curriculu m.\" [9] The emphasis by Thorndike and his fellows on the \"socialization\" of the student—in fact the subjugat ion of the student to the social order—as opposed to the teach ing of specific skills, is another factor that has led to a general breakdown of literacy in the United States, while a t the same time providing no noticeable increase in the abilit y to socialize—in fact, obviously the contrary. Thorndike believed that, \"Education is interested p rimarily in the general interrelation of man and his environ ment, in all the changes which make possible a better adjustment of human nature to its surroundings.\" This is another important aspect of Thorndike's and all of the other latter-day Wundtians' philosophies. Man is an animal who must adapt to the environment, that is, the social system and political regime, rather than adapting the environm ent to his own vision. Man is to be conditioned to accept the circumstances that he finds himself in, not learn t o change them. Again, the controlling elite have no qualms about 40"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"changing society or the environment to conform to t heir own whims—even if it takes 'dozing a rainforest—it is o nly the rebellious public-schooled who must have the devast ating defect of individuality brainwashed out of them. The socia lization tech- niques used by the Wundtians create robots, not soc iable people. Working out of the Teachers College at Columbia Uni versity and the later-established Lincoln School, and depen dent upon a steady infusion of Rockefeller money, the major lig hts in the field of Wundtian psychology, including Thorndike, Cattell, Russell, and Dewey, kick-started \"educational\" psyc hology, remaking the face of American schooling. And many o f these disciples of Wundt were very straightforward in pro claiming that the purpose of educational psychology was the creat ion of a New World Order. By the 1950s the Teachers College was indisputably the most powerful force in education in America, with approx imately one third of all school presidents and deans, and one f ourth of all American teachers accredited there. It must have be en reassuring to the Rockefellers and their ilk to see that materialistic psychology and education had won, and was now accepted as the norm in American school systems. NOTES: 1.

The Tavistock story—at least the public vers ion of it—begins immediately after World War II, when memb ers of British military intelligence created the Institute . In its own literature Tavistock is described as an organizatio n of \"dynamic psychiatry\" which was intended to practice what the y term \"societry\" on the planet as a whole—and what I term world mind control. British military intelligence itself, in the person s of many of its chief players, has been aimed at a one-world go vernment since its inception. British Secret Service directo rs on an almost one-for-one basis have been advocates of Fabian soc ialism. [1] It is alleged that Tavistock was set up much earlie r than its announced inception, over 20 years prior in 1921, b y Major John Rawlings Reese, on the orders of the Round Tab le's Royal Institute of International Affairs (also known as C hatham House). The RIIA, along with the American Council on Foreig n Relations, had been founded in 1919 during the Versailles Peac e Conference, both being early New World Order execut ive arms. Reese was the man who dreamed of \"building a societ y in which it is possible for any member of any social g roup to be treated [psychiatrically], without resort to legal means, and even if they do not desire such treatment.\" At the end o f World War II, Reese called for the creation of \"psychological shock troops\" who would fan out from the Tavistock Institute to e ngineer the future direction of society. [2] In 1932 Tavistock was put under the directorship of the German psychologist Kurt Lewin. Lewin was a founder of the National Training Laboratories and director of t he Harvard 43"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Psychological Clinic, and—an odd qualification for a psychiatrist, I think—one of the key players in the original crea tion of the OSS in America. Lewin is credited with much of the original Tavisto ck research into mass brainwashing, applying the resul ts of repeated trauma and torture in mind control to soci ety at large. If terror can be induced on a widespread basis into a society, Lewin has stated, then society reverts to a tabula rasa, a blank slate, a situation where control can easily be inst ituted from an exterior point. Put it another way: By the creation of controlled c haos, the populace can be brought to the point where it willi ngly submits to greater control. Lewin maintained that society m ust be driven into a state equivalent to an \"early childho od situation.\" He termed this societal chaos \"fluidity.\" Tavistock's focus in the early days was on strategi c warfare studies, in particular of Germany, with emphasis on the re- education of that errant New World Order colony. Du ring World War II many of the Institute's members, including i ts founder, Reese, ran the British Psychological Warfare Direct orate and subsidiary organizations based in the United States . After World War II Tavistock can functionally be considered to have become a part of Britain's Psychological Warfare Bureau, n ow working on projects dealing with the brainwashing of populatio ns. [3] Tavistock is governed by what it calls an invisible college, echoing antique occultist terminology and reminding one that British intelligence was founded by Freemasons and remains deeply Freemasonic to this day. The original use of the term \"invisible college,\" prior to the announced creatio n of Tavistock, was Reese's reference to an informal association he had created of all the psychiatrists then working in the Britis h military. For funding, the Tavistock Institute relies on larg e grants from anonymous benefactors—with no doubt a substant ial portion coming directly from the Crown—along with grants fr om the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Ca rnegie Institute, the World Health Organization, and the B ritish Home Office. Tavistock is also interlinked worldwide wit h a vast network of other organizations and think tanks, inc luding UNESCO, WHO, the World Federation for Mental Health , and the Rand Corporation. Tavistock is simply a front group for the psychological imposition of the New World Order on the planet, and its main philosophic tool is the Hegelian diale ctic framed in the terms of Lewin. 44"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Rockefellers have always been prominent in deci ding the course of Tavistock. According to the official chro nicler of the group, \"The Rockefeller Foundation, before making us a gra nt, would need to be satisfied, not only by our policie s... but also with the persons to carry them out.\" [4] In a Tavistock-funded profile of the group, it is s tated that the role of the institute has been: \"(a) The invention of the command psychiatrist as a medical- social role carrying out reconnaissance in a large structure and defined group, leading to the ascertainment and rec ognition of critical problems in the sphere of human relations and management. \"(b) The invention of social psychiatry as a policy science permitting preventative technical intervention in l arge-scale problems... \"(c) The fashioning of a whole series of military i nstitutions which concretely and effectively implemented the po licies advocated. \"(d) The invention of new types of therapeutic comm unities. \"(e) The invention of cultural psychiatry... \"Capability nurtured in the Tavistock for the psych iatrist to work with lay personnel—in this case the military—i n a collaborative partnership. In other words, the stra tegy of command psychiatry and the developments to which it led were psycho-dynamically conceived and based.\" Tavistock, born from the collaboration of the inter national monied elite, military intelligence, and the materi alistic psychiatric community, refers to its self-admitted \"military\" orientation as Operation Phoenix—again, a Freemason ic symbol that it shares with the infamous Vietnam War assass ination program. One is reminded of the Freemasonic legend \" Ordo Ab Chao,\" Order Out of Chaos, which could just as easi ly describe the Tavistock method of destroying a target subject , or a target population, prior to reprogramming; the Tavistock m odus operandi. Throughout the Tavistock literature—either official or Tavistock-inspired—they reiterate their \"global vis ion\" and make it clear that the institute is intended to wor k its long-term \"societry\" on the world regardless of the wishes of individuals who inhabit it. One of the most successful of Tavistock-offshoot or ganizations is what was o r i g i n a l l y known as the Na tional Training 45"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Laboratories (NTL), and now the NTL Institute for A pplied Behavioral Sciences, founded in 1947. Located in Be thel, Maine, the mission of the NTL is to give Lewin-inspired \"g roup dynamics\" sessions to American leaders. Again, duri ng group sessions \"dissonance\" or stress is introduced to de stroy the individual's previous beliefs, and then a new, grou p-oriented personality is coaxed forth. This is the primary te chnical method used by a myriad of Tavistock-influenced \"se nsitivity\" groups like Alanon and Esalen. Since the 1950s, NTL has processed the majority of America's corporate leaders in its programs, while simultaneously running the same programs for variou s segments of the government, including the Navy, the Departme nt of Education, and the State Department. None dare call it mind control. [5] Eric Trist, the chairman of Tavistock's governors, in 1963 described his and Tavistock's work on mass brainwas hing, delineating in detail his theory of \"social turbule nce,\" based upon the theories of Hegel, although again, Trist i s far more quick to cite Lewin. Trist postulated that the administering of a series of traumatizing shocks upon a society would destabiliz e it, lowering the overall character of the society's reasoning. T rist suggested that by late 1963 the world had moved into a condit ion of \"permanent social turbulence\" that would serve to u sher in a new condition of society, a new paradigm, and a new possibility for remaking the face of the planet. The nature of the permanent social turbulence that Trist foresaw is further defined in a book published in 1 975 by one of Trist's associates, Fred Emery. The book, Futures W e Are In, likens the condition of current day society to the violent punk welfare state of Anthony Burgess' novel, A Clockwor k Orange, written in the 1960s. Emery, in reflection of Trist, also trumpets Hegel. He describes the first stage of the breakdown of socie ty as being \"superficiality,\" in which previous societal values are questioned and discarded. He uses as an example of this the de ath of the Judeo-Christian paradigm. The next inevitable state is \"segmentation,\" in whi ch societal institutions break down, resulting in a reversion t o paranoid groups of individuals hostile to each other. The next stage in the breakdown of society would be the launching of a fascist movement akin to the Nazis. 46"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The final and most disrupted state of society is te rmed disassociation, in which the individual becomes the entirety of society for himself, and is isolated from other mem bers of the group. The dominant culture of the society becomes \"fantasy and superstition.\" According to Trist, the current \"wired society\" where the main interaction of the individu al is with electronic media is only a metaphor for disassociat ion. Cyberpunks, New Agers, and couch potatoes, take not e. It is interesting to note that the same progression can b e seen in the microcosm with the induction of the multiple person ality, an oft-asserted goal of intelligence agency brain-bang ing. In May 1967 at Queen Elizabeth's palatial estate in Deauville, France, a conference was convened. It was intended to update participants on ongoing projects of the Tavistock n etwork. This was the \"Conference on Transatlantic Technological Imbalance and Collaboration,\" sponsored by the Scientific and Technological Committee of the North Atlantic Assem bly and the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Among the pr ojects mentioned at the conference were the collaboration of Emery and Trist on \"social turbulence,\" and the SRI-Tavis tock \"Images of Man\" project. Participants in the conference included Tavistock's Harland Cleveland; Willis Harman of the Tavistock offshoot Stanford Research Institute; Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, the fu ture Carter national security advisor and the Trilateral Commis sion's founding executive director; and Fred Emery, who ha d earlier delineated the stages of societal disintegration in his Futures We Are In. Other participants were Dr. Aurelio Peccei, later to head the zero-growth fixated Club of Rome, then chairman of the Economic Committee of the Atlantic Institute, an im portant NATO think tank; and Sir Alexander King and Sir Sol ly Zuckerman, advisors to the British crown. Fleshing out the hologram of elitist New World Orde r planning is the information that Brzezinski is beli eved by many in Western intelligence organizations to be a KGB m ole, recruited by British Round Tabler and Rothschild-Wa rburg agent William Yandell Elliot. Henry Kissinger is also lin ked to this group, reportedly after being recruited to a KGB ho mosexual blackmail ring focused on the EICOM G-2 headquarter s in Oberammergau, Germany, at the end of the second wor ld war. Kissinger was a member of the U.S. Army 970th Counterintelligence Corps, involved in creating the Nazi \"rat lines\" that enabled many prominent Nazis to escape prosecution 47"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"at the end of World War II. Kissinger's reported mentor was Fritz Kraemer of th e Pentagon plans division, who also groomed Alexander Haig. Kraemer's secret life during WWII, according to dec eased conspiracy researcher Mae Brussel, was that of a sp ecial lieutenant to Hitler. What does it matter whose sid e you are on, the controllers might say? Both sides in the World War, or for that matter the Cold War, only served to foster the synthesis of the New World Order. [6] The principles that were agreed on at the Tavistock conference will sound very familiar to those who ha ve been following the reshaping of human institutions and v alues by the New World Order. These include the belief that man should not dominate nature, but instead become a part of it, w ith no more rights and privileges than, say, the purple-assed b aboon in the wild. Governments are obsolete and will be replaced by other, more encompassing institutions. Mankind is moving i nto a de- industrialized post-technological society, an \"info rmation age,\" the Age of Aquarius; again, aborigines with laptop computers. The primary impetus towards the evolution to the po st- technological society are the repeated shocks and c haos taking place, including such events as the Kennedy assassi nation, the Vietnam War, and the assault on traditional institu tions and thinking by the psychedelic counterculture. This philosophy was described exactly by Dr. Willia m Sargent of the Tavistock Institute in 1957 in his book Batt le for the Mind—A Physiology of Conversion and Brain-Washing. Again, the idea is that the micro reflects the macro: the occu ltist dictum, \"As above, so below.\" Sargent said, \"Various types of beliefs can be impl anted in many people after brain function has been sufficien tly disturbed by accidentally or deliberately induced fear, anger , or excitement. Of the results caused by such disturban ces, the most common one is temporarily impaired judgment an d heightened suggestibility. Its various group manife stations are sometimes classed under the heading of 'herd instin ct,' and appear most spectacularly in wartime, during severe epidemics, and in all similar periods of common danger, which increase anxiety and so individual and mass suggestibility.\" Out of the Tavistock conference also came Zbigniew Brzezinski's 1968 book The Technotronic Age, that p osits an information society whose basis of competition is r eplaced by \"amusement focus\" based on \"spectator spectacles (m ass sports 48"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"and TV) providing an opiate for increasingly purpos eless masses... New forms of social control may be needed to limit the indiscriminate exercise by the individual of their new powers. The possibility of extensive chemical mind control. .. will call for a social definition of the common criteria of restr aint as well as utilization.\" And some think that Guy DeBord's Soci ety of the Spectacle isn't literal. In the Technotronic Age, the \"nation state as a fun damental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the p rincipal creative force: International banks and multination al corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-sta te.\" Brzezinski also says of the \"Technotronic Age\" that , \"At the same time the capacity to assert social and politic al control over the individual will vastly increase. It will soon b e possible to assert almost continuous control over every citizen and to maintain up-to-date files, containing even the most personal details about health and personal behavior of every citizen in addition to the more customary data. \"These files will be subject to instantaneous retri eval by the authorities. Power will gravitate into the hands of those who control information. Our existing institutions will be supplanted by pre-crisis management institutions, the task of which will be to identify in advance likely social crises and to develop programs to cope with them. \"This will encourage tendencies through the next se veral decades toward a Technotronic Era, a dictatorship l eaving even less room for political procedures as we know them. Finally, looking ahead to the end of the century, the possib ility of biochemical mind control and genetic tinkering with man, including beings which will function like men and r eason like them as well, could give rise to some difficult que stions.\" A book written at the same time by the conference c hairman, Aurellio Peccei, was titled The Chasm Ahead, and it too echoed the prevailing elitist themes: Peccei reiterated th at a one-world government was the only solution to the problems of the world. Also required was that Russia and the U.S. would ha ve to enter into partnership in global planning and enforcement —a theme that has become increasingly obvious in recent year s with the Spetznaz setting up shop in Peoria and Tulsa, and C linton trying to lease the Long Beach Naval Yards to the mainland Chinese.

The truth about Newt exists much in contradiction to his image as a staunch upholder of Republican ideals and conservative family values. Gingrich is in fact another Trojan horse whose mentor is the \"futurist\" Alvin T offler. Toffler's book The Third Wave describes the current technocratic takeover of the world, the acquisition of virtually all wealth by a tiny elite, and the relegation of the v ast majority of the populace to a Third World foraging in the garba ge heaps of the rich. According to Gingrich, speaking to a crowd of yuppi es at a congress on \"Democracy in Virtual America,\" \"In the mid-to- late-'60s, I read Drucker's The Age of Discontinuit ies, Boulding's The Meaning of the Twentieth Century, Be ll's Beyond Post-Industrial Society—all of which were precursor s to the first popularizer of this notion, which was Future Shock, which was written basically a quarter of a century ago.

Boulding and his wife were responsib le for much bridge building between the Fabian \"societrists\" of Tavistock and the New Left in the 1960s. Gingrich revealed his not-so-hidden roots when he mentioned the \"anticipatory democracy\" project in h is introduction to The Third Wave. \"A/D,\" as it is ter med, was a project fielded by Tavistock in the 1960s intended to bring about a New Age shift toward anything but tradition al values, unless it is the Wellsian \"Open Conspiracy\" traditi onal values of the elite controllers. Among the later projects tha t would be created by participants in the \"A/D\" project would be the Malthusian Club of Rome and the Carter administrati on's Global 2000 plan. Gingrich was ushered into the Tavistock orbit in 19 65 when, as an undergraduate at Emory University, a professo r at Georgia Tech introduced him to the work of Boulding and Tof fler.

Norman, a man prone to repeated mental problems and hospitali zations, and who had been a staunch supporter of Hitler prio r to the war, announced the beginning of the British National Ass ociation for Mental Health, which was in fact only a renaming of the National Councils of Mental Hygiene, a group that had been h eavily involved in pushing eugenics programs prior to the war. With Hitler's downfall, eugenics had an extremely unsavo ry odor that needed to be deodorized with a name change. Certain ly eugenics never vanished, as witness, for example, t he thousands of women involuntarily sterilized in Sweden and oth er European countries until the mid-1970s. The NAMH functioned as a Tavistock-front organization which would soon becom e the controlling body for world psychiatry. [1] An examination of the officers of NAMH provides clu es as to its direction: Richard Austen Butler, the pro-Nazi deputy foreign minister to Lord Halifax, became president. Lord Ha lifax's son- in-law, the Earl of Feversham, became chairman. Vic e chairman was Norman's wife, Priscilla Reyntiens Worsthorne N orman, a vocal proponent of eugenics programs and the Nazis, who had assisted German rearmament by releasing 6,000,000 B ritish pounds in Czech gold to the Germans after the occup ation of Czechoslovakia. Otto Niemeyer, Norman's assistant a t the Bank of England, became treasurer of the organization. P erhaps the group should have been titled the Nazi Association for Mental Health? In 1948 an International Congress on Mental Health at the Ministry of Health in London was convened by Norman . The Congress was hosted by the British National Associa tion, whose patron was the Duchess of Kent, widow of the Grand Master of Masons and mother of the Grand Master of Masons to follow. A World Federation for Mental Health was formed at th e Congress, 55"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"with Brigadier General Dr. John Rawlings Rees, head of the British psychological warfare department and of the Tavistock Institute, named president. Co-director of the Worl d Federation was Dr. Frank Fremont-Smith, chief medical officer of the Rockefeller-spawned Josiah Macy Foundation that wou ld later be the primary funnel for CIA MKULTRA mind control fun ding. According to Nina Ridenour, technical coordinator o f the U.S. delegation to the Congress, \"The World Federation f or Mental Health... had been created upon the recommendation of the United Nations' World Health Organization and UNESC O because they needed a non-governmental mental health organi zation with which they could cooperate.\" The vice presidents of the Congress, again, provide a sense of its direction: Dr. Hugh Chrichton-Miller was a foun der of Tavistock, and vice-president of the C.G. Jung Inst itute in Zurich. The blatantly anti-Semitic Jung himself was another vice president of the Congress. Dame Evelyn Fox was a leading light of the British eugenics movement. Lord Thomas Jees Horder was president of the Eugenics Society of Gre at Britain. Dr. Winfred Overhulser was a high-ranking represent ative of the Scottish Rite Masons, and reportedly linked to Germ an spy activities in the U.S. Dr. Alfred Frank Tredgold wa s a member of Britain's Ministry of Health Committee on Steriliza tion. Providing additional insight into the goals of the manipulators of the WFMH are statements of Dr. G. Brock Chisholm , first director and later head of the World Health Organiz ation of the United Nations. Chisholm delivered an address to ps ychiatrists and government officials in Washington, D.C. in 194 5, confiding: \"What basic psychological distortion can be found i n every civilization of which we know anything? The only ps ychological force capable of producing these perversions is mor ality—the concept of right and wrong. The re-interpretation a nd eventual eradication of the concept of right and wrong are t he belated objectives of nearly all psychotherapy.\" [2] Chisholm also said that, \"The people who have been taught to believe whatever they were told by their parents or their teachers are the people who are the menace to the w orld.\" [3] Given these sentiments, that right and wrong do not exist and that parents are the persons least fit for educ ating their children, can any excesses and crimes of the \"menta l health\" field be a surprise?

Evans, director of the U.S. Army Military Stress Laboratory, and Nathan Kline, eugenicist and Columbia University psychiatrist, reported that the group \"c oncluded that the present breadth of drug use may be almost trivi al when we compare it to the possible numbers of chemical subs tances that will be available for the control of selective aspe cts of man's life in the year 2000.\" The study theorized, in obvious reflection of the T avistock Institute's plan, that American culture is \"moving toward a 'sensate society'. A greater emphasis is being plac ed on sensory experience and less upon rational or work-oriented philos- ophies. Such a philosophical view, coupled with the means to separate sexual behavior from reproduction or disea se, will undoubtedly enhance sexual freedom. \"It seems obvious that the youth of today are no lo nger afraid of either drugs or sex. Again, the philosophers and spokesmen for the avant-garde advocate the personal sensory e xperience as the raison d'etre of the coming generation.

In 1975, NIMH funded an overall evaluation of behav ior modification approaches.

[5] At about the same time, the Association for the Adv ancement of Psychotherapy, in their Mankind 2000 report, int roduced the following dark vision: \"In the organization of a civilization of the futur e we anticipate that the individualistically-oriented ma n will become an anachronism.

He told Roosevelt that, \"neither America nor Britain is fighting the new and important type of w ar on more than the smallest scale. Our defenses against polit ical and psychological warfare are feeble, and even such ges tures as have been made toward carrying the fight to the enemy ar e pitifully inadequate.\" So goes the story of the beginning of the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI), that was to evolv e into the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and in turn, th e Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Donovan's COI took the i dea of the \"Secret Vote\"—what has come to be termed \"black fun ding\" or \"black operations\"—from the British, allowing the o rganization and its successor organizations almost complete lat itude in its psychological warfare projects. In June, 1942, the COI morphed into the OSS. A peri od of time passed between the formation of the OSS and th e issuing of its charter due to Donovan's insistence that the ps ychological warfare unit of the organization should head up the operation. The Joint Chiefs of Staff finally agreed, saying th at \"All plans for projects to be undertaken by the Office of Strategi c Services will be submitted to the Joint U.S. Chiefs of Staff thro ugh the Joint Psychological Warfare Committee for approval. The J oint Psychological Warfare Committee will take final act ion on all internal administrative plans pertaining to the Off ice of Strategic Services.\" The OSS existed for three years and, according to W alter Bowart, in Operation Mind Control, \"it developed ps ychological warfare into an effective weapon against the minds of civilian and military populations foreign and domestic alike .

Estabrook contacted the Departm ent of War early in World War II and proposed the use of hypno sis in warfare. Although the government took Estabrooks up on his offer, he destroyed his diaries covering the years 1940-45, and was unwilling to talk much about what he had done. Eastabrooks is, however, said to have intimated to associates t hat he had researched the creation of hypnotically programmed couriers and the hypnotic induction of split personalities. Estabrooks became loose-lipped on one occasion when , in 1968, he chatted with a reporter for the Providence Evening Bulletin. According to the article that resulted, \" Dr. Estabrooks said that the key to creating an effective spy or a ssassin rests in... creating a multiple personality, with the aid of hypnosis, a procedure which the good doctor described as 'child 's play'. Estabrooks even offered the suggestion that Lee Har vey Oswald and Jack Ruby 'could very well have been performing through hypnosis.'\" Estabrooks quite possibly would have be en in the position to know. [1] One of the top secret projects that the OSS partici pated in during its formative years was the development of a \"truth drug\" to break down resistance in spies and POWs. This pr oject was run in conjunction with the Freemasons, and supervi sed by Superintendent Winfred Overhulser, the Scottish Rit e's chief psychiatrist, at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washin gton, D.C., along with a research team composed of Harry J. Anslinger , head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, and Dr. Edward Str ecker, then president of the American Psychiatric Association. The study assessed the uses of mescaline, scopolomine, peyote , and barbiturates, but settled upon a mixture of marijua na and tobacco, attempting to perfect a concoction that wo uld stimulate a \"state of irresponsibility.\" OSS scientists then came up with a potent extract of marijuana called \"TD.\" Its result s were noted in an OSS report: \"TD appears to relax all inhibitions and to deaden the areas of the brain which govern an individual's discretion a nd caution. It accentuates the senses and makes manifest any stron g characteristics of the individual. Sexual inhibitio ns are lowered, and the sense of humor is accentuated to the point where any statement or situation can become extremely funny t o the subject. On the other hand, a person's unpleasant characteristics may also be heightened.\" The result s obtained with TD, however, were inconsistent, a nd research was 60"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"reported discontinued.

On September 20, 1945, the OSS was termi nated by executive order.

Allen Dulles and his brother, John Foster Dulles, s tood at the pinnacle of American government and strategic plann ing during the 1940s and 1950s—while at the same time being am ong the most influential agents for the New World Order. Bo th brothers were brought into the State Department prior to Wor ld War I by their uncle, Secretary of State Robert Lansing. Acc ording to the Dulles family biography, \"Robert Lansing was... so pro-English that he even took elocution lessons to perfect the English accent he was cultivating.\" Lansing was good friends with British spy Alex Gaun t, and \"Allen [Dulles]... thought Gaunt was one of the mos t exciting men he had ever met, and he made up his mind that one o f these days he would become an intelligence operative just like him—except for the accent, of course.\" [1] Lansing brought both of the Dulles brothers into th e Paris peace negotiations, an affair guided by members of the Rhodes Round Table group. Other members of the Wilson dele gation were Bernard Baruch, J.P. Morgan's Thomas Lamont, a nd Paul Warburg. It is alleged that the 14 points of the pe ace plan were formulated at a secret meeting of the Grand Orient Freemasonic Lodge of France and the International Masonic Confe rence, on June 28-30, 1917. Whether that is true or not, on t he American side, President Woodrow Wilson was accompanied by C olonel E.M.

It is also alleged that, to guarantee his continued efforts in the creation of a League of Nations, Woodrow Wilson was given a bribe of one million dollars in gold and gems, and that his subse- quent nervous breakdown was based on his belief tha t he would have to return the money after the failure of the L eague. [2] House was an intimate of major international banker s, and persuaded Wilson to lobby for the League of Nations , the precursor to the United Nations. In 1916, upon Hous e's urging, Wilson created the first President's Brain Trust to formulate plans for a world government. House headed up the c ommittee, with 150 members including Norman Thomas (later to be head of the American Socialist Party), and the Dulles br others. At the Paris conference the Dulleses made the acqua intance of members of the Round Table, and a dinner party w as arranged by House and held at the Majestic Hotel, in Paris, with the Dulles Brothers, other Americans in the Wilson camp , and English members of the Round Table. An agreement wa s made to form a group \"for the study of international aff airs.\" John Foster Dulles acted in 1920 as an agent of the grou p in setting up the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. According to a 1953 CFR publication: \"The Royal Ins titute of International Affairs and the Council on Foreign Re lations were founded in 1920 as a result of discussions between members of the British and American delegations at the Peace C onference in Paris in 1919. The two institutions, though complet ely inde- pendent, have developed their work along parallel l ines in Britain and the United States.\" With funding from J.P. Morgan, Rockefeller, and mem bers of the Round Table, the CFR acquired its headquarters at Harold Pratt House, 58 East 68th Street, in New York. [3] At Versailles, Dulles was able to fulfill his ambit ion of working in espionage, by meeting T.E. Lawrence, \"Lawrence o f Arabia,\" and gaining entree into British intelligence circle s. Lawrence ran the British Intelligence Arab Bureau, whose hea d at the time was Harry St. John Philby. Philby's son, Cambridge Apostle Harold \"Kim\" Philby coordinated both British and Am erican intelligence agencies beginning in 1949, training o fficers for the CIA and staying in contact with Allen Dulles on a d aily basis.

In 1921 Allen Dulles was posted to Berne, Switzerla nd by his uncle, Secretary Lansing, where he took over the ro ll of chief of intelligence in the American ligation. In Switzerla nd, Dulles was met by his cousins, members of the Mallet family. D ulles' uncle, Petit Dulles, had married the Swiss-American Julia Mallet- Prevost. Both the Prevosts and the Mallets were uni quely powerful families in international politics and fin ance, holding hereditary seats in the \"Council of 200\" ruling Gen eva, Switzerland. This group, with the British royals, f ormed a joint committee of spymasters working for the aristocracy that went back to at least the 18th century. The Mallet-Prevo sts were also responsible for injecting the Scottish Rite of Maso nry into the United States. [4] By the mid-1920s, Dulles was tapped to be the First Secretary of the American Embassy in Berlin. Dulles was also a director of the Schroder Bank, that handled Hitler' s personal funds. In June 1920, American army Captain Truman S mith was brought in to the Berlin mission as a \"military obs erver.\" In 1922, after Mussolini, in the pay of British intell igence, had taken over Italy, Captain Smith was dispatched by t he embassy on a mission to Munich. According to his 1964 report of the visit, \"I talke d at length about National Socialism with the Munich consul, Mr . Robert Murphy (later a very distinguished American ambassa dor), General Erich Ludendorff, Crown Prince Ruprecht of Bavaria, and Alfred Rosenberg. The latter became the politic al philosopher of the Nazi party. \"On this visit I also saw much of Ernst F.S. Hanfst aengl, of the well-known Munich art family. \"Putzi\" was a Harvard graduate and later became Hitler foreign press chief. Hanfst aengl states in his 1957 memoirs, Unheard Witness, that it was I who brought him into contact with Hitler. This may well be so, but the actual facts of this introduction are not firml y fixed in my memory. \"My interview with Hitler lasted some hours. The di ary I kept in Munich indicates that I was deeply impresse d by his personality and thought it likely that he would pla y an important part in German politics. I must confess, however, t hat I did not see him as the future ruler of Europe.\" [5] The memory of another who was present was somewhat sharper. As related by Smith, \"Fourteen-and-one-hal f years later —on March 3, 1937 — he accompanied Mr. Hugh Wils on, our 65"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"newly appointed ambassador to Germany to the chance llors palace... for his initial reception by Adolph Hitle r.

When Smith's turn came, he shook hands with Hitler and was about to pass on, when he felt a hand grasp his sle eve. 'Have I not seen you before?' Hitler asked. I was somewhat surprised but answered immediately, \"Yes, Mr. Chancellor, in Munich in 1922.' 'Oh yes,' replied Hitler, 'you introduced me to Hanfstaengl.'\" There are other aspects of Smith's memory which see m to have dulled over the years. The German-American Han fstaengl, a friend of Franklin Roosevelt, noted in his 1957 m emoirs that he had been assigned by Captain Smith to join Hitle r's movement, and to promote Hitler's rising star. As H itler succeeded in Germany beyond anyone's expectations, Hanf- staengl and his highly-placed American connections served as press agents to the world for Der Fuhrer. Hanfstaen gl, according to one credible account, was the man who provided access to the Reichstag when conspirators set it af ire—the aftermath of the fire being that Hitler was able to claim a Communist revolution and to seize totalitarian cont rol of Germany. After he fell out of favor with the Nazi r egime, Hanf- staengl worked as an American psychological warfare advisor. [6] Although the thought is only speculative, in 1918 H itler had been gassed in World War One, and was removed from the front lines to a hospital in Bavaria. A Doctor Forrester, cited as \"the father of modern hypnosis\" was brought in and treat ed Hitler for what was thought to be hysterical blindness. At abo ut that time Hitler dreamed that he would be prominent in politi cs and would rise up to control Germany. Although there is probably no way of verifying it as this late date, Hitler may h ave been, as researcher John Judge puts it, \"one of the earliest psycho- patsies.\" [7] John Foster Dulles, newly graduated from Princeton, was hired by the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell, whe re he would later become the chief executive. Sullivan and Crom well were the premier lawyers to the Eastern Establishment, a s well as representing a host of German cartels including I.G . Farben, central in the prosecution of Germany's war. John F oster Dulles was one of the primary organizers of American fundi ng for Hitler through international elitist financier Hjalmar Sch acht, who later ran the Nazi economy. He was also the lawye r for Richard 66"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Merton, the founder of I.G. Farben. [8] The Dulles family had been among the key players in the International eugenics movement, advocating, accord ing to John Foster Dulles, that \"it is only by eliminating the lower members (of the human race] that a higher average is mainta ined.\" [9] John Foster Dulles' business partner, Council on Fo reign Relations and Bonesman Averill Harriman—later to be thought of as the elder statesman of the Democratic Party—was the son of robber baron railroad man E.H. Harriman. Averell Ha rriman ran the private banking firm of Brown Brothers, Harrima n, heavily staffed with Bonesmen including Prescott Bush, the father of Bonesman George Bush. As an example of his devotion to the Illuminati cause, Harriman chose 322, the Skull and Bones secret number, for the combination on his briefcase when he had carried secret messages between London and Mosc ow in World War II. Among the major accomplishments of Harriman, guided by Skull and Bones, was financial and diplomatic suppo rt for the Soviets—at the time quite illegal by dint of regula tion of the State Department. Harriman had possessed large business h oldings in both Russia and Germany since the early days of the century, and was also involved in RUSKOMBANK, the first Soviet c ommercial bank, whose first vice president was Skull and Bone sman Max May of Guaranty Trust. Harriman and other Bonesman also owned a large percentage of the Union Bank, which w as key in supporting Hitler in the early days. Out of the eig ht directors of Union Bank, six were Nazis or members of Skull and Bones. Harriman would later be in the thick of organizing CIA mind control programs, creating the Psychological Strate gy Board (PSB) in 1951. [10] The Harrimans, again, were represented by Sullivan and Cromwell, and were the single most prominent Easter n Establishment promoters of eugenics, a study later to be furthered through the horrific programs of Hitler's psychiatric and medical establishments. Harriman's mother had b ankrolled International Eugenics Congresses and the Eugenics Records Office in New York, that had called for the sterili zation of 15 million Americans by 1980, in order to create the \" perfect man.\" Averill Harriman himself had contributed larg e sums to eugenics causes. [11] The director of the Psychological Strategy Board wa s Gordon Gray, a Naval Intelligence officer, who later becam e a close ally of Bonesman George Bush. Another close Harriman ass ociate was Bonesman Eugene Stetson, who had been assistant manager 67"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"for George Bush's father, Prescott Bush, at Brown B rothers, Harriman in New York. Stetson organized the H.

The H. Smith Richardson Foundation later was involv ed in the Iran-Contra affair, where it functioned as a \"p rivate donors steering committee\" in tandem with the National Sec urity Council. In later years the Foundation ran the Cent er for Creative Leadership training \"leaders of the CIA.\" [12] As the careers of Allen and John Foster Dulles and their friends had been in many ways integrated with Nazi interests, so it was with the formation of the CIA. After the def eat of Stalingrad in January 1943 the German general staff were unified in their belief that the war was lost. Depu ty Fuhrer and head of the Nazi Party Martin Borrmann and Hermann Schmitz, chief executive of I.G. Farben, developed a plan wh ereby large numbers of Nazis would flee Europe and hunker down in hideouts around the world, waiting for that bright day when they might take another shot at world power. The first s tep in this plan was the transferal of large amounts of Nazi lo ot to safe positions, this including three tons of gold, large quantities of other precious metals and stones, and perhaps a bil lion dollars in currency. Hitler's \"favorite commando,\" Otto Skorzeny, was pu t in charge of moving Nazi assets and in the creation of \"rat lines,\" escape routes to Nazi colonies around the globe. An estimated 5,000 members of Hitler's SS and Gestapo were exfil trated through Catholic monasteries, in a plan concocted b y Papal Chamberlain and Knight of Malta Luigi Parelli. Assi sting in the project was the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corp s (employ- ing Henry Kissinger) and the Office of Naval Intell igence. [13] General Reinhard Gehlen, in charge of the Third Rei ch's military intelligence in Eastern Europe and the Sov iet Union, and utilizing fascist organizations in Eastern Euro pe, had an even bolder plan for continuing his influence after the end of World War II. Using his top aides, the most importa nt of his intelligence files were stripped, with the rest bur ned. Fifty-two crates of files were buried in the Bavarian Redoubt , in a mountainous region called Misery Meadow. Within two weeks of the war's end, Gehlen walked in to an Army command center in Bavaria, and announced \"I a m head of 68"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"the Section Foreign Annies East in German Army head quarters. I have information to give of the highest importanc e to your government.\" Gehlen was ignored and sent to the pri son camp at Salzburg, but within a month someone had taken n otice and he was brought to Augsburg for interrogation. Soon after that, Gehlen's associate Hermann Baun was forming up what would be called the \"Gehlen Org,\" and Gehlen himself was fly ing to the U.S., dressed in an American military uniform to es cape detection, to confer with top American military off icials. On August 24, 1945 Gehlen stepped out of a U.S. Arm y transport plane at Washington National Airport, and was driven to Fort Hunt, located outside of Washington, D.C. A t Fort Hunt an agreement was worked out between Gehlen, Allen D ulles, and others, whereby Gehlen's intelligence organization would be grafted almost intact onto the OSS, giving birth to the CIA. Gehlen's Org, it is said, was initially funded by D ulles to the tune of $200 million and, minimally supervised and working out of a fortified stronghold in Bavaria, grew to contr ol the entirety of the West German intelligence service. Gehlen's i ntelligence agency also dominated NATO, providing an estimated 70 percent of the intelligence provided to that organi zation on the Soviet Union and Europe. Thus, American intelligenc e was infiltrated by the Nazis, who found their associati on with men like the Dulles brothers, Harriman, and George Bush to be friendly and of a strangely familiar nature. [14] Key to the CIA's MKULTRA and other mind alteration programs—both scientifically and philosophically—wa s the Nazi connection. From the 1930s until the end of World W ar II, Nazi psychiatrists in Germany had been horrifically impl ementing the Darwinian \"eugenics\" philosophy that they had inher ited from the West, from men like the Englishman Francis Galt on, a cousin of Charles Darwin. The basics of this philos ophy dealt with the improvement of hereditary qualities of a r ace. This can be accomplished, per the eugenicists, in a number o f ways, including selective mating and the sterilization of mental defectives and members of \"inferior\" races. During this period it is reported that at least 300 ,000 mental patients were exterminated in Germany. After the wa r the psychiatrists involved in these extermination progr ams were not punished. In fact, some of the most prominent worke rs in psychiatry, chemical warfare, and mind control-rela ted areas were imported to the U.S. to work in the scientific establishment and the military under Project Paperc lip, through which as many as 5,000 German scientists were sneak ed into 69"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"the country, with others immigrating later. Among the Nazis imported to the U.S. were Karl Taub oeck, who had been the chief plant chemist at I.G. Farben 's Ludwigshaven factory, and who was the Nazi's expert on sterilization drugs and had done work that parallel ed the OSS and CIA in attempts to formulate a \"truth drug\"; Fr iedrich Hoffman, who discovered a paralysis drug based on c onch shell venom; and scientists Theodore Wagner-Jauregg, Karl Rarh, and Hans Turit, who were specialists in poison gases li ke Tabun and Sarin (the latter allegedly the gas of choice of Ja pan's AUM cult). Another Nazi imported to the U.S. was Dr. Huburtus Strughold, who had overseen murder and torture of inmates at t he Dachau concentration camp. Strughold was employed by NASA and later lauded by that organization as the \"father of space medicine.\" Another Nazi employed by the U.S. after the end of the war was former SS Brigadier General Walter Schieber, de scribed by one army officer as \"the prototype of an ardent and convinced Nazi who used the Party to further his own ambition s.\" Schieber worked for over ten years at the Chemical Division in West Germany on chemical warfare and the production of n erve gas. Many Nazis scientists, some of whom like Schieber c ould not be brought to the U.S. because of their notoriety, wer e employed in chemical warfare research in West Germany. [15] Combing the 7,104 entries in the 1957 edition of th e Biographical Directory of the Fellows and Members o f the American Psychiatric Association, 1,125 came from G ermany and Eastern European countries. [16] It is instructive to note that CIA mind control sci entists, like the Nazis, used certain target groups for experimen tation, including ethnic minorities, foreigners, mental pat ients, prisoners, sex deviants, addicts, and the terminall y ill. Another connection of the Nazis, the British, and c hemical mind control deserves to be mentioned in passing. A lthough the mere thought that a mass chemical drugging of the p opulation could ever take place is ridiculed in the popular m edia, that was not the position of Charles Eliot Perkins, one of A merica's top industrial chemists. Perkins was dispatched by the U.S. government to assist in taking over the German indu strial giant I.G. Farben after World War II. In a letter that Pe rkins wrote to the Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research in Milw aukee, Wisconsin on October 2, 1954, he stated, \"I have your letter of September 29 asking for furt her documentation regarding a statement made in ray boo k The Truth About Water Fluoridation to the effect that t he idea of 70"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"water fluoridation was brought to England from Russ ia by the Russian Communist, Kreminoff. \"In the 1930's Hitler and the German Nazis envision ed a World to be dominated and controlled by the Nazi ph ilosophy of pan-Germanism...

Among the drugs that were most commonly used in this kind of research were Desoxyn and Pentothal, Secona l and Dexedrine. CIA experimenters fixed intravenous hook ups in both of the subject's arms, monitoring the effects of the drugs and regulating their flow. The idea, according to l aborers in the CIA's mind fields, was to create a sudden cathartic expulsion of the feelings and thoughts, and the communication of any information that the subject might be hiding. [1] In 1947 the Navy instituted Project CHATTER, run by Dr. Samuel Thompson, a Navy commander and psychiatrist, with G. Richard Wendt, chairman of the Psychology Departmen t at the University of Rochester being the functional head o f the program. CHATTER is reported to have been a relativ ely unsuccessful truth drug project that ended in 1953. At about the same time the Army was involved in THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT. [2] The mindset of the CIA at its inception is reflecte d in a top secret report submitted to President Eisenhower in 1954. The report called for, \"aggressive covert psychological , political, and paramilitary organization more effective, more uniq ue, and if necessary, more ruthless than that employed by the enemy... We... must learn to subvert, sabotage, and destroy our enemies by more clever, more sophisticated, and more effective methods than those used against us...\" [3] According to John Marks, \"In 1949 the Office of Sci entific Intelligence (OSI) undertook the analysis of foreig n work on certain unconventional warfare techniques, includin g behavioral drugs, with an initial objective of developing a ca pability to resist or offset the effect of such drugs. Preliminary pha ses included the review of drug-related work at institutions suc h as Mount 73"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Sinai Hospital, Boston Psychopathic Hospital, Unive rsity of Illinois, University of Michigan, University of Min nesota, Valley Forge General Hospital, Detroit Psychopathic clinic , Mayo Clinic, and the National Institute of Health.\" \"This first project,\" Marks states, \"code-named Pro ject BLUEBIRD, was assigned the function of discovering means of conditioning personnel to prevent unauthorized extr action of information from them by known means. It was furthe r assigned to investigate the possibility of control of an ind ividual by application of special interrogation techniques, me mory enhancement, and establishing defensive means for p reventing interrogation of agency personnel.\" The black-budget BLUEBIRD, run by Morse Allen, was intended to create an \"exploitable alteration of pe rsonality\" in agents, POWs, refugees, and defectors, and CIA empl oyees of the program were dispatched around the world to procure rare botanicals, herbs, and drugs that might be of use. The primary agency involved with BLUEBIRD was the Joint Intelli gence Committee, the same group responsible for the Proje ct Paperclip importation of Nazis into the U.S. At least a thousand soldiers were fed up to 20 dose s of LSD under the auspices of BLUEBIRD. Other documented BL UEBIRD projects involved the dispatching of a team to Toky o in July, 1950 for the interrogation of suspected double agen ts, and the use of \"advanced\" techniques on North Korean prison ers of war in October, 1950. In August, 1951 BLUEBIRD was renamed ARTICHOKE and transferred from the Office of Scientific Intellige nce (OSI) to the Office of Security (OS). Additional LSD experiments were done by the CIA under the auspices of ARTICHOKE, using A gency volunteers and, verified by CIA memoranda, unwittin g subjects. One ARTICHOKE experiment is documented in a CIA memorandum to the director dated July 14, 1952. The memo deals with the use of narco-hypnotic induction, sod ium pentothal, and the stimulant desoxyn. The interroga tion was conducted on Russian agents believed to be double a gents. According to the memo, \"a psychiatric medical cover was used to bring the ARTICHOKE techniques into action. In the first case, light dosages of drugs coupled with hyp nosis were used to induce a complete hypnotic trance. This tra nce was held for approximately one hour and forty minutes o f interrogation with a subsequent total amnesia produ ced by posthypnotic suggestion. In the second case (an ind ividual of much higher intelligence than the first), a deep hy pnotic trance 74"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"was reached alter light medication. This was follow ed by an interrogation lasting for well over an hour. Howeve r, a partial amnesia only was obtained at this time, although a total amnesia was obtained for a major part of the test. Since fu rther interrogation was desired, a second test was made o n this individual in which the ARTICHOKE technique of usin g a straight medication was employed. On this test, hig hly successful results were obtained in that a full int errogation lasting two hours and fifteen minutes was produced, part of which included a remarkable regression. During this regression, the subject actually 'relived' certain past activit ies of his life, some dating back fifteen years while, in addition, the subject totally accepted Mr. [deleted, the case officer] as an old, trusted, and beloved personal friend whom the subject had kn own in years past in Georgia, USSR. Total amnesia was appa rently achieved for the entire second test on this case.\" The memo concluded, \"For a matter of record, the ca se officers involved in both cases expressed themselve s to the effect that the ARTICHOKE operations were entirely successful and team members felt that the tests demonstrated c onclusively the effectiveness of the combined chemical-hypnotic technique in such cases. In both cases, the subjects talked c learly and at great length and furnished information which the ca se officers considered extremely valuable.\" More insight into ARTICHOKE is provided by a confer ence summary, addressed to the Chief of Security, CIA, d ated July 15, 1953: \"Mr. [deleted] then discussed the situation of a fo rmer Agency official who had become a chronic alcoholic and who, at the present time, was undergoing operative treatmen t in [deleted] for a possible brain tumor. This individu al had called the Agency prior to the operation and warned that w hen given certain types of anesthetics (sodium pentothal), pr eviously he had been known to talk coherently. The matter was t aken care of by placing a representative in the operating roo m and by bringing the various personnel participating in the operation under the Secrecy Agreement. Mr. [deleted] stated t hat the subject did talk extensively under the influence of sodium pentothal and revealed internal problems of the Age ncy. Dr. [deleted] added that he was acquainted with the det ails in the case. \"[Deleted] then commented that this type of thing h ad been a source of great concern to himself and others in th e operations work and stated that he hoped that the ARTICHOKE ef forts to 75"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"produce some method that would perhaps guarantee am nesia on the part of those knowing of Agency operations in v ital spots would be successful. He stated that some individual s in the Agency had to know tremendous amounts of informatio n and if any way could be found to produce amnesias for this type of information—for instance, after the individual had left the Agency—it would be a remarkable thing. Mr. [deleted ] stated the need for amnesias was particularly great in operati ons work. Mr. [deleted] explained that work was continually being done in an effort to produce controlled amnesia by various mea ns.\" A CIA ARTICHOKE document, dated July 30, 1956, mentioned the use of the alkaloid bulbocapnine to i nduce catatonia or stupor. The document stated, \"We desir e to have certain psycho-chemical properties tested on man, u sing the bulbocapnine which we were fortunate to obtain from [deleted], a sample being enclosed herewith. More bulbocapnine is available if needed.\" A request was included that subjects be tested for \"loss of speech, loss of sensitivity to pain, loss of memory , and loss of will power.\" [4] NOTES: 1.

Early on, the main proponent s of the use of psychoactive drugs in Western culture were the s ocial planners and elite. Just before the new century, in 1898, medical man, literateur, and Fabian Socialist Havel ock Ellis began experimentation with peyote. Today Ellis is primarily known for his seven volume Psychology of Sex, but in the early part of this ce ntury he was a prime mover in literary and intellectual circles—pa rticularly communist and anarchist groups. Ellis described his exper- iences with peyote in \"Mezcal: A New Artificial Par adise,\" published in the January, 1898 issue of the Contemp orary Review. [1] Interest in peyote and the synthesized version of t he alkaloid, mescaline, remained scant, outside of the occasiona l parlor peyote ritual conducted in a not-dissimilar way fro m the spiritualist fad of the same era, or the odd psychi atric monograph talking about how the drug seemed to repr oduce schizophrenia. But a far more potent brain-changer would soon appe ar on the scene. LSD was first synthesized in 1938 at San doz laboratories, in Basel, Switzerland, although the e ffects of the drug are said not to have been discovered by Dr. Al bert Hofmann until 1943. Basle was the home of three huge chemic al companies, Hoffman-LaRoche, Ciba-Geigy, and Sandoz, the latter owned by German chemical monolith I.G. Farben, the mainstay of the Third Reich's war. Although the connection i s not often made, and is denied by Dr. Hofmann, I.G. Farben mai ntained a division researching psychoactive agents, and it is possible that Hofmann was employed in this capacity. It is also a world-class coincidence that S.S. and Gestapo doctors were doin g mescaline experiments on prisoners at Dachau at the same time , less than 77"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"200 miles away. Allen Dulles, who directed the CIA during the MKULT RA project, was station chief at Berne, Switzerland du ring the period of the LSD research, and had been an executi ve at I.G. Farben. His assistant was James Warburg, who later worked with acid-popularizer Aldous Huxley. [2] Captain Al Hubbard, the spy who was termed \"the Joh nny Appleseed of LSD,\" told the story of the beginnings of LSD in a different form than the usual chronologies. He said that Hofmann had discovered LSD many years earlier, and that he had been a member of a secret group connected with Rudolf Steiner's mystical Anthroposophy group that had set out to manufacture a \"peace pill\" in the early 1930s. [3] Early experiments with LSD were conducted by Werner Stoll, a psychiatrist affiliated with the University of Zu rich. There were rumors that one of Stoll's female patients was given the drug without her knowledge, and had committed suici de, a foreshadowing of later CIA atrocities. Although perhaps a marginally less potent drug than the television broadcasting that was launched at nearly the same time, the LSD infusion of America was to have a tre mendous effect on the future of the country. When LSD arriv ed in America in 1949, psychiatry was booming, having exp erienced an approximate 12-fold increase since 1940. The cha racter of psychiatry was, in many ways, an extension of warti me psychiatry, not surprising considering the fact tha t American \"mental health\" organizations were predominantly pu ppeteered from Tavistock. As per the \"societry\" engineered by that organization, after Brigadier General William Menni nger was elected the head of American psychiatry an ambitiou s strategy was hammered out, namely the application of psychia try to the man in the street.

In fact, the Americans were using germ war fare, but this provided the CIA with air cover: with their ow n mind control research they were simply attempting to cat ch up to advances by the Communists. This was not a true pic ture, as admitted by CIA deputy director Richard Helms in 19 63, when he informed the Warren Commission that American min d control research had always been more advanced than that of the Communists. CIA Director Allen Dulles was also out stumping for mind control. Addressing the National Alumni Conference at Princeton University on April 10, 1953, he talked a bout \"how sinister the battle for men's minds had become in S oviet hands.\" Three days later Dulles authorized MKULTRA, a greatly augmented series of mind control projects run by th e Technical Services Staff of the CIA. MKULTRA was the code name for a huge mind control project that was, according to CIA documents \"an um brella project for funding sensitive projects,\" run by the CIA and coordinated by British Intelligence, Scottish Rite Freemasons, and very-recently-reformed Nazis. The related MKDEL TA \"covered... policy and procedure for use of biochem icals in clandestine operations.\" [1] MKULTRA was birthed when Richard Helms, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations (known as the \"dirt y tricks\" department), recommended that the agency expand its work in both offensive and defensive brainwashing. No mere grunt in the CIA trenches, Helms was Eastern Establishment a ll the way, his grandfather the first director of the Internati onal Bank of Settlements, and a president of the Federal Reserv e. Helms 79"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"would be present at the death of MKULTRA when he or dered the destruction of the program's files in 1966. The program was run by Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, \"the brainstorming genius of MKULTRA\", who until 1973 wo uld supervise the CIA's research into mind control. Got tlieb was viewed with favor by Richard Helms, and would hang onto Helms' coattails as he climbed to higher and higher positions in the Agency. [2] Dulles diverted an initial $300,000 for MKULTRA. Ac cording to Agency documents, the program was planned to ope rate outside of the normal channels without \"the usual c ontractual arrangements\" and was to be highly \"compartmented.\" [3] The primary front for funding MKULTRA operations wa s the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, created in 1930 and st affed by Rockefeller-financed psychologists and eugenicists. The foundation was headed by Black Chamber alumnus Gene ral Marlborough Churchill. The Macy Foundation's medica l director during 1954-55 was Frank Fremont-Smith, also a pres ident of General Reese's World Federation of Mental Health. [4] The recollections of an intelligence officer detail ed in a CIA memorandum flesh out the scope of the MKULTRA proje ct: 17 January 1975 MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD SUBJECT: MKULTRA 1. The following represents the best of my unaided recollection regarding the MKULTRA program. I was f irst briefed on it in 1962. At that time it was in the p rocess of a significant decrease in activity and funding. As Ch ief, Defense, and Espionage (C/D&E), I continued to decrease fund s significantly each year until the program was phase d out in the late 1960s. 2. MKULTRA was a group of projects most of which de alt with drug or counter-drug research and development. The Director Central Intelligence (DCI) and the Deputy Director of Plans (DDP) were kept informed on the program via a nnual briefings by Chief Technical Services Division (C/T SD) or his Deputy. Most of the research and development was ex ternally contracted and dealt with various materials which w ere purported to have characteristics appealing for the ir covert or clandestine administration under operational condit ions. The objectives were behavioral control, behavior anomal y production 80"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"and counter-measures for opposition application of similar substances. Work was performed at U.S. industrial, academic, und governmental research facilities. Funding was o ften through cut-out arrangements. Testing was usually done at s uch time as laboratory work was successfully completed and was often carried out at such facilities as the [deleted in o riginal] and the [deleted in original]. In all cases that I am aware of, testing was done using volunteer inmates who were witting of th e nature of the test program but not the ultimate sponsoring or ganization. 3. As the Soviet drug use scare (and the amount of significant progress in the MKULTRA program) decrea sed, the program activities were curtailed significantly as budgetary pressure and alternate priorities dictated. 4. Over my stated objections the MKULTRA files were destroyed by order of the DCI (Mr. Helms) shortly b efore his departure from office. CI OFFICER By Authority of 10272 [5] A large network of doctors and facilities were empl oyed in at least 149 subprojects, all of them relating to mind control. MKULTRA and MKDELTA researched the use of at least 139 different drugs, as well as radiation and electrosh ock, but also delved into more arcane social applications in soci ology, anthropology, and psychiatry. What might those buzz terms have concealed? Eugenics experiments? Genetic manipulati on? Tavistockian social engineering? Within the first year of its operation, MKULTRA was taking it to the streets. Drugs that had shown promise in the lab were slipped to unwitting subjects in normal social situ ations; citizens were dosed with psychotropics without their knowled ge. This portion of the project was supposedly terminated in 1963, although there are suggestions that this was not th e case. Early CIA LSD research by the CIA was conducted by Max Rinkel and Robert Hyde—reportedly the first America n to take LSD—at Boston Psychopathic Hospital, Carl Pfieffer at the University of Illinois, Harold Hodge at the Univers ity of Rochester, Harold Abramson at Mt. Sinai Hospital an d Columbia University in New York, Harris Isbell at the Addict ion Research Center in Lexington, Kentucky, and Louis Jolyon Wes t at the University of Oklahoma. Other early experimentation in LSD research was don e by Dr. Joel Elkes, who had concocted nerve gasses in Brit ain during 81"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"World War II. He performed experiments with LSD in England in 1949, later moving his base of operations to St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C. [6] Dr. Harold Abramson, who had studied in Berlin prio r to World War II, and was later employed in the Technic al Division of the U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Service, received $85,000 for an LSD study. His proposal indicated that he \"hoped \" to give hospital patients \"who are essentially normal from a psychiatric point of view... unwitting doses of the drug for ps ychotherapeutic purposes.\" Abramson was directed to produce \"operationally per tinent materials along the following lines: \"a. Disturbance of Memory; b. Discrediting Aberrent Behavior; c. Alteration of Sex patterns; d. Eliciting of Info rmation; e. Suggestibility; f. Creation of Dependence.\" Abramson performed his research at Columbia Univers ity and Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, New York, the latt er the location of both of the Dulles brothers' estates an d ground zero for eugenics research in America since the turn of the century. Abramson was responsible for giving LSD to Frank Fr emont- Smith and British cultural anthropologist Gregory B ateson and his wife Margaret Mead, both of whom were involved with Tavistock and in MKULTRA projects. Bateson establis hed an LSD research center at the Palo Alto Veterans Admin istration Hospital in California, and gave acid to Beat poet Allen Ginsburg, among many others. [7] As CIA research into LSD continued, the intoxicatio n was contagious. Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, the director of MK ULTRA, and his staff were regularly partying with LSD, and spi king each other's drinks for a lark. At one bash in November 1953, Gottlieb slipped LSD into Dr. Frank Olson's Cointre au without his knowledge. Olson became deeply depressed and wa s taken to see Dr. Harold Abramson. After the first visit, Abramson came to see Olson at his hotel room carrying a bottle of bourbon and a bottle of Nembutal. As John Marks comments, \"an unu sual combination for a doctor to give someone with sympt oms like Olson's.\" Olson was scheduled to be taken to Chestnut Lodge, a Rockville, Maryland sanitarium where many of the ps ychiatrists had top secret CIA clearances. The night before he was to enter the sanitarium, he leaped—so it is reported—to his death through the closed window of the Statler Hilton in New York. [8] The CIA immediately went into cover-up mode on the Olson death. Although his widow was given a government p ension, the 82"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"t r u t h about the cause of the scientist's death woul d not be admitted for two decades. Alice, Frank Olson's wife , went on national television and read the following statemen t from the family at that time: \"We feel our family has been violated by the CIA in two ways. First, Frank Olson was experimented upon illegally and negligently. Second, the true nature of his death w as concealed for twenty-two years... In telling our story, we ar e concerned that neither the personal pain this family has expe rienced nor the moral and political outrage we feel be slighted . Only in this way can Frank Olson's death become part of American memory and serve the purpose of political and ethical refo rm so urgently needed in our society.\" For their complicity in Olson's death, Gottlieb and his team received a verbal reprimand that was not recorded i n their personnel files. The Olson story was not over. Forensic scientists investigating the case exhumed the man's body in 19 94. They reported that they found skull fractures that sugge sted homicide, rather than an accident. One can only spe culate about what really happened to Frank Olson. Was he threate ning to blow the whistle on MKULTRA the night of his death? [9] Freemason Dr. Paul Hoch was another person involved in investigating LSD for the CIA. Hoch was a member of the American Eugenics Society, and co-director, with fo rmer-Nazi eugenicist Franz Kallman, of research at Columbia U niversity's New York State Psychiatric Institute. Hoch and Kall man worked under the direction of the Scottish Rite of Freemas onry's Field Representative of Research on Dementia Praecox, Dr. Nolan D.C. Lewis. Hoch was also appointed State Mental Hygiene Commissioner by New York Governor Averell Harriman, and was reappointed to the position by Governor Nelson Rock efeller. Another MKULTRA mastermind was 33rd degree Freemaso n Robert Hanna Felix, director of psychiatric researc h for the Scottish Rite and NIMH director from 1949 to 1963. Using CIA funds, Felix personally oversaw the experiments of Dr. Harris Isbell, who gave black prison inmates LSD for 75 co nsecutive days, tripling and quadrupling the dosage when the inmates demonstrated drug tolerance, and where drug-induced sleep was periodically interrupted by electroshock. According to the Senate subcommittee testimony of f ormer inmate James Childs, volunteers for the Isbell proj ect were paid off with heroin. Childs said, \"You knock on this li ttle door, and the guy would look out... and I would say, 'I want 15 milligrams.' 83"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"He would say, 'Where do you want it? In your arm, y our skin or your vein?' Everybody that was on the research... g ot the payoff of the drug.\" [10] In 1953, Los Angeles psychiatrist Dr. Nick Bercel w as contacted by the CIA and asked to determine how muc h LSD it would take to send the entire population of the Cit y of the Angels on a trip. Bercel's results were disappointi ng: he found that chlorine in the water supply neutralized the d rug. The CIA, according to internal documents, went right to work on a version of LSD that would not be affected by chlori ne. [11] The CIA may have actually attempted the acid dosing of a town somewhat earlier. At Pont-Saint-Esprit, France , in 1951, the whole town suddenly went crazy. Many persons died during the course of the unexplai ned hysteria, and hallucinogenic after-effects were fel t by the townspeople for weeks. Although the incident is usu ally attributed to the effects of ergot contaminated rye flour, the date of the occurrence—near the beginning of CIA interes t in LSD—is more than interesting. A similar, although less deadly incident took place in the U.S. in 1989, when 600 junior and senior high school stu dents were preparing for a music program in Santa Monica, Cali fornia. A sudden rash of headaches, nausea, dizziness, and fa inting affected about 250 students. Given the CIA and othe r intelligence agency's penchant for drug testing on civilians, it is not impossible that this was such another such case . [12] In the mid-1950s Operation BIG CITY in New York use d a 1953 Mercury automobile with a tailpipe extended 18 inches to emit a gas, probably LSD, into the streets. Another test in the same series tests were undertaken with battery powe red emission equipment fitted into suitcases. The equip ment was used to spray LSD in the New York subway system. An unnamed gas was released off of the Golden Gate Bridge abou t this time, although it is said to have dissipated in the wind without causing anyone any harm. In 1957 CIA Inspector General Lyman issued the foll owing internal memo, stating that \"precautions must be ta ken not only to protect the operations from exposure to enemy fo rces, but also to conceal these activities from the American public in general. The knowledge that the Agency is engaging in unethical and illicit activities would have serious repercussions in political and diplomatic circles and would be de trimental to the accomplishment.\" [13] From the beginning of the CIA's work with LSD there were 84"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"concerns about relying on the Swiss for their suppl y of the drug. While obtaining weekly supplies from Sandoz, the CI A was also funding the Eli Lilly company in the United States to synthesize the drug so as to ensure a steady supply. In 1954 L illy announced that they had succeeded. A memo to Allen Dulles noted that with unlimited supplies, LSD could now b e taken seriously as a chemical warfare agent, and that it could be bought in \"tonnage quantities.\" [14] The most infamous of MKULTRA doctors was Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron. In 1942 the Rockefeller Foundation fo unded the Allen Memorial Institute at McGill University, located at gothic Ravenscrag, in Montreal, Canada. Dr. Cameron was placed in charge of the psychiatric division, and b egan experimentation straight out of the Rocky Horror Sh ow, but lacking the wit. The program was funded by the Cana dian military, the Rockefeller Foundation, the OSS, and later, the CIA. Cameron's training was at the Royal Mental Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland, under Sir David Henderson, a eug enicist. Cameron went on to found the World Federation of Me ntal Health's Canadian division, in association with his friend, Tavistock's Brigadier General John Rawlings Rees, a nd to become arguably the most influential psychiatrist o n the planet. He became president of just about every psychiatric organization there was at the time; the Canadian, American, and World Psychiatric Organizations, the Quebec Psychiatric A ssociation, the American Psychopathological Association, and th e Society of Biological Psychiatry. Cameron was no rogue in the field of psychiatry, but instead one of its most influential leaders. [15] Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty, a Pentagon liaison to t he CIA at the time of Cameron's experiments, in 1992 stated: \"If you get a hold of a directory for the American Psychiatric As sociation in around 1956 or 1957, you'll be surprised to find th at an enormous percentage of the individuals listed are f oreign-born. Mostly they came out of Germany and Eastern Europe in a big wave. They were all called 'technical specialists,' but really they were psychiatrists. They went into jobs at universi ties mostly—but many were working on these 'unconvention al' mind control programs for U.S. intelligence... These wou ld go to people like Dr. Cameron in Canada.\" [16] In 1957 Cameron submitted a grant application to \"t he Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology,\" al so known as the \"Human Ecology Fund,\" a CIA front working out o f the Cornell University Medical School in New York City. Cameron's application proposed the funding of experimentation involving: 85"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"\"i. The breaking down of ongoing patterns of the pa tient's behavior by means of particularly intensive electro shocks (depatterning). \"ii. The intensive repetition (16 hours a day for 6 or 7 days) of the prearranged verbal signal. \"iii. During this period of intensive repetition th e patient is kept in partial sensory isolation. \"iv. Repression of the driving period is carried ou t by putting the patient, after the conclusion of the period, in to continuous sleep for 7-10 days.\" After receiving the requested funding of $60,000, C ameron and his underlings employed these and a wide variet y of other mind-blasting techniques on subjects who had in man y cases not volunteered for experimentation. Those techniques, seemingly more suited for the torture of prisoners of war tha n for the rehabilitation of Canadian citizens, included the \" sleep treatment\" developed by Hassan Azima at the Institu te, and the administering of Thorazine and barbiturates on a co ntinuous basis so that patients would sleep 20 to 22 hours a day. Using the British Page-Russell electroconvulsive te chnique, Cameron would put victims into drug induced coma fo r weeks, waking them to administer a one-second electroshock , followed by from five to nine additional jolts depending on the itchiness of his trigger finger. Cameron increased the voltag e normally administered by practitioners of this technique, an d the number of shock sessions from one to two or three per day. Predictably, patients given this kind of treatment were often re duced to a vegetables. [17] Another of Cameron's strategies was to place his vi ctims into sensory deprivation chambers for up to 65 days, dev astating them with LSD, then using \"psychic driving,\" in whi ch a repetitive phrase taken from the emotionally charge d material they had told to a psychiatrist would be played thr ough a pillow with unremovable earphones. Cameron documented his researches in psychic driving, funded by the Depart ment of Health and Welfare between 1961-64, in research pap ers titled \"Study of Factors which Promote or Retard Personali ty Change in Individuals Exposed to Prolonged Repetition of V erbal Signals,\" and \"The Effects upon Human Behavior of t he Repetition of Verbal Signals\". [18] According to one psychiatrist, Cameron's theory was \"the ways in which people behave are determined by some sort of nervous system arrangements in the brain. Since psy chotherapy can change behavior, the neural arrangeme nts must be 86"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"reversible.\" Cameron himself \"wondered whether the behavior patt erns of adults could be erased by a physiologic process that attacked neural patterns. Could adults be made theoretically patternless? Could they be returned to a state of neurologic and psychologic infancy for a short period, and then could new patt erns of behavior be introduced?\" Does one detect the flavor of Tavistock here? By 1960 Cameron had developed his techniques, which he termed \"ultra-conceptual communication,\" into somet hing even more horrific. The period of psychic driving was in creased to 16 hours a day for 20 to 30 days and patients were dosed with Sernyl to \"block sensory input and produce underact ivity.\" Sernyl is an extremely powerful drug used as an ani mal anesthetic. It produces \"acute psychotic episodes a nd even the danger of chronic psychosis in humans.\" [19] Although standards for medical experimentation had been clearly defined at Nuremberg almost ten years befor e Cameron's funding by the CIA, specifically requiring \"informe d consent\" by subjects, subjects at the Allen Memorial Institute did not sign consent forms, nor did they in most cases have any idea of what they were getting into. This was the standard, rath er than the exception, during most MKULTRA research, in fact. Two of Cameron's assistants were Leonard Rubenstein , \"an electrical whiz of Cockney descent who lacked medic al bonafides,\" who effused about the possibilities of equipment \"that will keep tabs on people without their knowin g,\" and Dr. Walter Freeman, who had performed 4,000 frontal lob otomies in 20 years, reportedly on persons often suffering onl y from depression or paranoia. Freeman went on to become a highly successful brain specialist working for many years in San Francisco. [20] In 1979 a public interest legal case was launched a gainst the CIA for their activities during the MKULTRA period, with details of the lawsuit appearing in the Hamline Journal of Public Law and Policy. Dr. Paul Termansen appeared in court as an expert witness, and described what had happened to Robert Logie, one of Cameron's patients at Ravenscrag: \"Instead of a standard treatment, Mr. Logie underwe nt a series of experimental, highly controversial, proce dures... Mr. Logie was not a suitable subject for any one of the experimental procedures he was subjected to, if, indeed, anyone would be suited for such procedures. Most certainly, no one would be suitable to the type of experimental procedures use d at Allan 87"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Memorial Institute at that time, unless they had vo lunteered to undergo those experimental procedures.\" Dr. Termanson said that after being subjected to Ca meron's experiments, \"existence could best be termed margin al... He managed to function, work, and exist, but barely.\" Another expert witness in the trial, Dr. Brian Doyl e, provided information on the case of Rita Zimmerman, who was \"depatterned\" by Cameron with 30 electroshocks, had 56 days of drug-induced sleep, was subjected to 14 days of negative \"psychic driving,\" and then was given 18 days of po sitive \"psychic driving.\" Dr. Doyle said, \"Mrs. Zimmerman was not a candidate for electroshoc k therapy, much less the intensive 'depatterning' pro cedures that were so disruptive as to leave her incontinent as t o bladder and bowel... The intensive electro-shocks that were use d to 'depattern' Mrs. Zimmerman were clearly experimenta l, as was the entire 'depatterning' procedure that was carrie d to an extreme in her case. The nearly two months of drug- induced sleep and over one month of 'psychic driving' Mrs. Zimmerman underwent were equally extreme applications of clea rly experimental procedures... The experimental 'depatt erning,' prolonged drug induced sleep and 'psychic driving' procedures used on Mrs. Zimmerman would inevitably cause injur y to her mental and physical health.\" Doyle commented similarly on the case of Florence Langleben, who had received electroshocks and LSD, 43 days of drugged sleep, and 43 days of psychic driving: \"Mrs. Langleben was not a candidate for electroshoc k therapy, much less the intensive 'depatterning' pro cedures... The intensive electroshocks that were used to 'depa ttern' Mrs. Langleben were clearly experimental, as was the ent ire 'depatterning procedure. The six weeks of drug-indu ced sleep and six weeks of 'psychic driving' Mrs. Langleben u nderwent were equally extreme applications of clearly experi mental procedures... The experimental 'depatterning,' prol onged drug induced sleep and 'psychic driving' procedures used on Mrs. Langleben would inevitably cause injury to her ment al and physical health.\" [21] Another of Cameron's many victims was Mary Morrow, whose background was in nursing. After completing a resid ency in neurology at the University of Michigan she approac hed Cameron for a fellowship at Allan Memorial. Accordi ng to a legal document filed in Washington, D.C., \"Because Camero n thought she appeared 'nervous,' he told Dr. Morrow tha t a medical 88"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"examination would be required before her applicatio n could be considered. Dr. Morrow was then hospitalized at the Royal Victoria Hospital, a facility affiliated with McGil l University and the Allan Memorial Institute. After she left the Ro yal Victoria Hospital, Dr. Morrow was admitted as a paying patie nt at the Allan Memorial Institute on May 6, 1960, and placed under Cameron's care. For an eleven day period from May 1 9, 1960, through May 29, 1960, Dr. Morrow was subjected to depatterning experiments employing Page-Russell electroconvulsive shock treatments and a variety of barbiturates, specifically thorazine and anectine. The combinatio n of these drugs produced a condition of brain anoxia [insuffi cient oxygen reaching the brain] in Dr. Morrow and on June 17, 1 960, she was transferred, at her family's insistence, to the medical department of the Royal Victoria Hospital, where sh e was diagnosed as suffering from acute laryngeal edema [ a severe allergic reaction to the drugs].\" Similar experimentation was taking place elsewhere. Forty- two-year-old tennis professional Harold Blauer had been suffering from depression after a divorce. On D ecember 5, 1952, he checked himself into a psychiatric hospita l in Manhattan. Unbeknownst to Blauer, the hospital had contracted with the U.S. Army for a chemical warfare test with mescaline derivatives. Lacking any information as to whether the derivatives had ever been tested on humans, a docto r at the hospital injected Blauer five times with the concoc tion. Records show that for a while Blauer seemed to be experienc ing some improvement, although it is questionable how mescal ine might have contributed. Whatever the case, the experiment ation on Blauer was continued until the fifth injection on January 8, 1953. That dosage was sixteen times the strength of the first injection. Blauer began to sweat and then went into convulsions, frothing at the mouth. The man lapsed into a coma a nd was pronounced dead two hours later. The hospital did not inform Blauer's relatives that he had been the unwitting victim of a chemical warfare exp eriment, instead saying that he had died of an \"overdose of a drug.\" When Blauer's family sued, the claim was settled fo r $18,000, half of it provided by the government through the h ospital, on the condition that the the nature of the experiment ation done on Blauer be kept secret by the hospital from the f amily and the world. [22] Early on, the CIA had come to the conclusion that f or truly realistic results it was necessary to test LSD outs ide of the lab, 89"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"on persons in real-life situations. Harry Anslinger , head of the Federal Narcotics Bureau, supervised one such opera tion, run by George Hunter White, a narcotics officer who had or ganized a spy training school during World War II. Using CIA funding, White rented an apartment in Greenwich Village, and equipped it with surveillance equipment and two-way mirrors. White, posing alternately as a seaman and as an artist, lu red unsuspecting persons back to his apartment and gave them LSD. The large number of adverse reactions to the acid—s ome requiring the subjects to have weeks of hospitaliza tion—caused White to code name the drug \"Stormy.\" In 1955 White transferred his base of operation, an d set up two experimental LSD launching pads in San Francisc o. This was the period of Operation Midnight Climax, in whi ch White paid prostitutes to bring customers to one of these unsafe- houses for unconventional action. The drinks of the unwitting participants were laced with LSD and their actions were observed by White, who sat behind a two-way mirror on a portable toilet with a drink in his hand. San Franc isco Narco Bureau agents would also take advantage of Midnight Climax, sampling both the drugs and their purveyors. White's activities continued until 1963, when CIA I nspector General John Earman found out about Midnight Climax during routine Technical Services inspections. Although an extended period of Agency soul-searching followed in the wak e of revelations about safehouse experiments, the operat ions continued until at least 1966, when White retired f rom the Narcotics Bureau. White reminisced about his CIA mission, in a quote made famous by chroniclers of the CIA and mind control: \"I was a very minor missionary, actually a heretic, but I toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards because it was fun, fun, fun. Wher e else could a red-blooded American boy lie, kill, cheat, steal, r ape, and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All-Highest?\" [23] One prominent victim of MKULTRA was Philip Graham, a graduate of the Army Intelligence School at Harrisb urg, Pennsylvania, and the owner and publisher of the Wa shington Post and Newsweek magazine. Graham made the mistake of attacking the American news media in a speech to a meeting of publishers in January, 1963. Leslie Farber, a psych iatrist from the CIA's Chestnut Lodge, was dispatched to deal wi th Graham. Graham was drugged and flown to Maryland where afte r 10 days he was released, only to be returned to Chestnut Lo dge in June. Released into the custody of his wife in August, he was found 90"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"shot to death - allegedly a suicide. His will was d eclared void because of insanity, and Katherine Graham, his wido w, inherited the Washington Post and Newsweek. [24] Early in the research of mind control techniques, t he \"disposal problem\" was encountered, i.e. how to get rid of persons who had been the subject of mind control pr ograms. One way of dealing with these persons was to put th em, according to an Agency document, \"in maximum custod y until either operations have progressed to the point wher e their knowledge is no longer highly sensitive, or the kno wledge they possess in general will be of no use to the enemy.\" Other means of disposal were putting them into mental instituti ons, slipping them a lobotomy, or in certain cases \"termination w ith extreme prejudice,\" killing them. In two series of tests, in 1958 and in 1959-60, U.S . Army Intelligence, in conjunction with the Army Chemical Corps and the CIA, began a program of testing of LSD and othe r psychoactive compounds at the Medical Research Labo ratories at Edgewood Arsenal. The focus of the testing was on \" unwitting test reaction\" with the intention to find out how a n LSD-dosed soldier would fare during interrogation. Groups of military personnel were given EA-1729, th e Army's code designation for LSD, then filmed while interro gators tried to pry forth classified information from them. Ther e were also \"Memory Impairment Tests\", evaluating the ability o f the subjects to recall information that had been previo usly imparted, and drills in skills including tank driving, anti-a ircraft tracking, and field maneuvers. After the first phase of testing, a letter was sent from the Chief of the Clinical Division at Edgewood to the C ommanding General of the Army Intelligence Center extolling t he brilliant results of the acid tests. Also recommended was tha t \"actual application of the material [LSD] be utilized in re al situations on an experimental basis, if possible.\" U.S. Army Intelligence encouraged Edgewood to go ah ead with the field testing: \"This headquarters has forw arded your letter to the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intellig ence (ACSI), Department of the Army, concurring in your recommen dation that actual application of the material be utilized in real situations on an experimental basis.\" In correspond ence between the Director of Medical Research at Edgewoo d and the Commander, Chemical Warfare Labs, it was indicated that the plan was to use LSD outside of the U.S. or on forei gn nationals. On August 8, 1960, the Office of Assistant Chi ef of Staff 91"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Intelligence Liaison Team flew to Europe to brief i ntelligence agencies on the joint project. At least two program s resulted, the first being Operation THIRD CHANCE, a 90-day Eu ropean project involving the administering of LSD to forei gn nationals and one American soldier who had allegedly stolen c lassified documents. Operation DERBY HAT was a similar projec t planned to take place in Hawaii, although accounts of it are contradictory. One source says that the project was aborted, while another states that an Army Special Purpose T eam trained in LSD interrogations questioned seven alleged Japa nese Communists, putting at least one of them into a com a. Testing was apparently done on unknowing Americans citizens, as well. These experiments were reportedl y reserved for small groups of individuals, although there wer e suggestions of larger scale testing taking place at some point in the future. The Chemical Corps' Major General Creasy remembered , \" I was attempting to put on, with a good cover story, to test to see what would happen in subways, for example, when a c loud was laid down on a city. It was denied on reasons that always seemed a little absurd to me.\" [25] Records show that Chemical Corps officers were rout inely given acid during their training at Fort McClellan, Alabama. Other tests of LSD on army personnel were conducted at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland; Dugway Proving Ground in Utah; Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; and Fort Benning , in Georgia. By the mid-1960s at least 1,500 army personnel are documented as having been used in Chemical Corps LS D experiments. Other researchers that were funded by the military included Charles Savage at the Naval Medical Research Instit ute, Amedeo Marrazzi of the University of Minnesota and Missour i Institute of Psychiatry, James Dille of the University of Washin gton, Gerald Klee of the University of Maryland Medical School, Neil Burch of Baylor University, Henry Beecher of Harvard and Mas sachusetts General Hospital, and Paul Hoch and James Cattell o f the New York State Psychiatric Institute. [26] Soon the Army would go on to bigger, but not necess arily better things. Hoffmann-La Roche, a pharmaceutical company in Nutley, New Jersey, was the army's source for a new psychoactive compound, quinuclidinyl benzilate: BZ. This is a drug with even more profound effects than LSD, effe cts that last for about three days—but that have been known to la st for six weeks. One army doctor noted of BZ that, \"During th e period of acute effects the person is completely out of touc h with his 92"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"environment.\" [27] Dr. Van Sim, who was chief of the Clinical Research Division at Edgewood Arsenal, routinely tested on himself al l of the new drugs that he would later give to recruits. Sim rep orted of BZ, \"It zonked me for three days. I kept falling down a nd the people at the lab assigned someone to follow me aro und with a mattress.\" Army testing of BZ began at Edgewood Arsenal in 195 9, and continued until 1975. Dr. Solomon Snyder of Johns H opkins University, who was involved in drug testing for th e Chemical Corps, stated, \"The army's testing of LSD was just a sideshow compared to its use of BZ.\" An estimated 2,800 soldiers were given BZ, with som e of them suffering drug-related disabilities to this da y. BZ, deployed in the grenades, mortar shells, and missiles, was a llegedly also used in combat in Vietnam. [28] NOTES: 1. Bowart, Walter, Operation Mind Control.

Aldous Huxley, who spearheaded t he Tavistock LSD project, was the grandson of Thomas H . Huxley, one of the founders of the Rhodes Round Table group . Huxley had been tutored by H.G. Wells, that vocal proponen t of the Open Conspiracy, and was a long term collaborator with A rnold Toynbee, a fifty-year member of the RIIA council, a s well as the head of the British intelligence Research Division. To grasp Toynbee's politics, in 1971 he stated that a Bolshe vik dictatorship of the world was necessary before a be nevolent one world order could be instituted. The new Tavistock project was intended to inject a euphoria- producing chemical on a widespread basis in America . Huxley's purposes in the dissemination of LSD in the United States may have been betrayed in the following statement: \"Now let us consider another kind of drug—still undiscovered, but probably just around the corner—a drug capable of making people happy in situations where they would normally feel miserable. Such a drug would be a ble ssing, but a blessing fraught with grave political dangers. By m aking a harmless chemical euphoric freely available, a dict ator could reconcile an entire population to a state of affair s to which self- respecting human beings ought not to be reconciled. ..\" [1] Elsewhere, Huxley stated it more succinctly: \"There will be in the next generation or so, a pharmacological met hod of making people love their servitude, and producing.. . a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies.\" [2] Finally, if there is any doubt about Huxley's belie fs, in Brave New World Revisited he stated, \"The twenty-first century... will be the era of the World Controllers... The older dictators fell because the y could never supply their subjects with enough bread, enou gh circuses, 95"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"enough miracles and mysteries. Under a scientific d ictatorship education will really work—with the result that mos t men and women will grow up to love their servitude and will never dream of revolution. There seems to be no good reason why a thoroughly scientific dictatorship should ever be o verthrown.'' [3] The decadent Huxley had been a member of the Childr en of the Sun, a British drug and homosexuality cult whos e roster of members illustrates a number of ideologies shared b y British one-world elitists at that time and now. Among the other members of the group were the Nazi-sympathetic Prin ce of Wales, later to be Edward VIII; fascist Sir Oswald Mosely; the Mitford sisters (one the wife of Mosley, the other a bedmate of Hitler); George Orwell, British intelligence agent and the author of 1984. (Orwell's 1984 is usually cited as a prote st against totalitarian socialism, but in fact Orwell himself was a socialist who was protesting, as he said, certain excesses th at had taken place in Russia). Other members of the Children of the Sun included H uxley's homosexual lover, author D.H. Lawrence, and Guy Bur gess, Soviet spy and member of the Apostles communist homosexual conclave at Cambridge (dubbed \"a homosexual Freemas onry\"), that spawned a Soviet spy cabal at the highest leve ls of British intelligence. Another member of the Apostles was the famous Reill y, \"Ace of Spies,\" a bisexual who—according to Reilly biogr apher Robin Bruce Lockhart—set up the Soviet spy group at Trini ty College, Cambridge through which Western intelligence was ma ssively compromised. Members of this group included spies A nthony Blunt, Burgess, Maclean, and others. Reilly's view may be gauged by a letter he wrote to Lockhart's father on the topic of \"Bolshevism\": \"I believe that... it is bound by a process of evol ution to conquer the world, as Christianity and the ideas of the French Revolution have done before it... and that nothing— least of all violent reactionary forces—can stem its ever-rising tide... the much decried and so little understood 'Soviets' whi ch are the outward expression of Bolshevism as applied to prac tical government, are the nearest approach I know of, to a real democracy based upon true social justice and that t hey may be destined to lead the world to the highest ideal of statesmanship—Internationalism.\" [4] Huxley had earlier collaborated with Major John Raw lings Rees of the Tavistock Institute, and with cultural anthropologist 96"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Bronislaw Malinowski in a project dubbed \"Mass Obse rvation.\" This was an anthropological survey of the British I sles, patterned after similar surveys of primitive cultures. [5] Although Huxley had personally used drugs—there are rumors that he was initiated in the use of opium by Aleist er Crowley in Berlin in the 1920s—he was introduced to the halluc inogen mescaline in 1952 by family friend and CIA-funded D r. Humphrey Osmond. Huxley came to the U.S. accompanie d by Osmond, who was immediately ushered into Dulles' MK ULTRA. Huxley, Osmond, and the University of Chicago's Rob ert Hutchins immediately began planning for a mescaline project to be funded by the Ford Foundation, although this pro ject was later called off due to objections from the head of the foundation. [6] In 1953, one month after the creation of MKULTRA, H uxley was given LSD by Osmond. Huxley was overwhelmed by \"the most extraordinary and significant experience this side of the Beatific Vision.\" Although Huxley was perhaps a sin cere advocate of the mysticism-inducing properties of LS D, the sociopolitical implications of the drug did not esc ape him. Huxley prepared the American population for LSD wit h articles like \"The Doors of Perception,\" and sponso red a project at Stanford University where students were dosed wi th hallucinogenics. Two of Huxley's early acid collabo rators were Alan Watts, who popularized his own brand of Zen sa tori based on a quart of gin a day, and Gregory Bateson, who h ad been an anthropologist with the OSS, and who started an LSD clinic at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital in C alifornia. Huxley was also in contact with MKULTRA heavyweight Dr. Louis Jolyon West. [7] Huxley was to be the first director of the United N ations Economic, Social, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO ), whose constitution was written by Bonesman Archibald McLe ash. UNESCO has been a major phalanx in the New World Or der program, advocating the \"appropriate technology\" of windmills and solar power rather than industry for the Third World, and mass sterilization drives implemented in those same countries. Huxley collaborator Keith Ditman provided author Ke n Kesey with an unlimited supply of LSD, and it was from th is small group that arose Kesey's guerrilla theatrical Merry Pranksters and the Grateful Dead, a rock band that still comma nds a large cultic following after the demise of its leader. Ac cording to a 1968 FBI memorandum, Jerry Garcia, the leader of th e Grateful Dead, was employed \"to channel youth dissent and re bellion into 97"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"more benign and non-threatening directions.\" [8] A collaborator with Huxley in the acid infusion of the world was the spy, Captain Alfred M. Hubbard, who had giv en up American citizenship for Canadian prior to World Wa r II. Characterized as a \"mystery man\" by those who knew him, and as a veritable \"Johnny Appleseed of LSD\" in most st udies, his verified background is informative. Hubbard was \"a high-level OSS officer\" who acted as a money conduit to a large number of European spy operation s, and who directed the large scale smuggling of weapons to Gr eat Britain prior to Pearl Harbor. He also worked for the Treas ury Department, the Federal Narcotics bureau, and the F ood and the Drug Administration. Hubbard is said to have worked with the Mafia—actually, sometimes the differentiation betwe en these organizations is tenuous—being \"able to ingratiate himself with both sides during Prohibition,\" according to one hi story of the period. At one time he became deputy chief of secur ity for the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas. Hubbard was the first large scale distributor of LS D to the world, reportedly amassing the world's largest stoc kpile of the drug outside of the CIA, and crossing and re-crossi ng the North American continent like a mysterious Rosicrucian of old, giving LSD to anyone and everyone who was willing to take it. Osmond and Hubbard participated in a program to giv e political leaders in America LSD—without severing h is connections and ongoing projects with various intel ligence agencies. Although the details of this program are secret, an associate of Hubbard's has said that it \"affected t he thinking of the political leadership of North America.\" Partici pants in the program included a prime minister, UN representativ es, members of British parliament, and assistants to he ads of state. Hubbard, oddly enough retaining a staunchly conserv ative bent throughout his proselytizing and distribution of LSD, led raids for the FDA on LSD labs characterized by his apologists as being run by \"rebel chemists.\" Imagine, a rebel che mist having the audacity to make LSD. One associate of Hubbard's was New World Order theo rist Willis Harmon of the Stanford Research Institute. S RI had earlier received grants from the U.S. Army to resea rch chemical incapacitants. When visited by a representative of the underground press at SRI in the early 1970s, Harmon told the man, \"There's a war going on between your side and mine. And my side is not going to lose.\" In 1968 Harmon invited Hubbard to join the Stanford 98"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Research Institute as a \"special investigative agen t.\" According to Harmon, \"Our investigations of some of the curre nt social movements affecting education indicate that the dru g usage prevalent among student members of the New Left is not entirely undesigned. Some of it appears to be prese nt as a deliberate weapon aimed at political change. We are concerned with assessing the significance of this as it impac ts on matters of long-range educational policy. In this connection i t would be advantageous to have you considered in the capacity of a special investigative agent who might have access to releva nt data which is not ordinarily available.\" Perhaps it is my cyni cism that gives the above paragraph a decided tongue-in-cheek quali ty. Hubbard took on the job for SRI, which lasted throu gh the 70s, at $100 per day. The most high profile of all LSD proponents was, of course, counterculture hero Timothy Leary. Leary met Aldous Huxley at Stanford University and became his protege. While a t the University of California from 1953-56, and employed by the U.S. Public Health Service from 1954-58, Leary received grants for his research from NIMH. Leary subsequently was appointed as a lecturer at H arvard, where he was noticed by Dr. Harry Murray, who was i n charge of the Personality Assessments department of the OSS d uring World War II. Although Leary and his biographers ti ptoe around the matter, funding for his drug experiments while at Harvard came from the CIA, substantiated by the following q uote from Walter Bowart, in the second edition of his Operati on Mind Control: \"...At first he denied that any of his psychedelic research projects at Harvard were funded by the government. Yet when I finally sat with him face-to-face after Operation M ind Control had been published (1979), and naively asked him if he was 'witting' or 'unwitting' of his collaboration with the CIA, Leary answered with: 'Who would you work for, the Yankees or the Dodgers? I mean who was I supposed to work for, t he KGB?'\" [9] Leary first administered LSD to prison inmates at t he Massachusetts Correctional Institute, at Concord. M oney for the project came from the Uris Brothers Foundation in N ew York City, and was doled out by Harvard to Leary. The re sults of Leary's Concord experiments were published in a 196 2 paper titled, \"How to Change Behavior.\" The man who some have called Leary's \"guru\" and who Leary himself acknowledged as being a British intelligenc e agent was 99"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Michael Hollingshead, a friend of Huxley's who had worked for the British Cultural Exchange and had acquired a gr am of LSD, enough of the chemical for 10,000 trips. Hollingshe ad, dispatched by Huxley, was the man who turned Leary on to acid. According to one account of the period, \"Not knowin g quite where to turn, he latched onto Hollingshead as his guru. Leary followed him around for days on end, treating the E nglishman with awe. He was convinced that this pot-bellied, c hain smoking prankster whose face was pink-veined from a lcohol was a messenger from the Good Lord Himself.\" Hollingshead later turned on most of the English ro ck music scene to acid. While in Wormswood Scrubs prison in England for 21 months for possession of hashish, Hollingshe ad made the acquaintance of George Blake, a convicted agent of the KGB. Hollingshead guided Blake in an LSD session, and a few weeks later the spy escaped from the prison and fled to M oscow. [10] Leary and Richard Alpert (later, Baba Ram Dass, aft er that plain Ram Dass) were fired from Harvard in 1963—Alp ert for giving acid to an undergraduate, Leary for missing a committee meeting—although the duo then carried on their rese arch in Mexico. Expelled from Mexico, they moved their base of operations to Millbrook, New York, where Leary unve iled his acid guru persona to the millions in the hippie mov ement. Mary Pinchot Meyer, a longtime friend of Leary, ex- wife of top CIA agent Cord Meyer, and a mistress of JFK, to ld Leary that, \"dissident organizations in academia are... being c ontrolled. The CIA creates the radical journals and student organi zations and runs them with deep cover agents.\" Although this wa s difficult for Leary to believe, no doubt causing him to think that Meyer was a paranoid conspiracy freak, the statement was confirmed for him by an article in the February 1967 Ramparts magazine, detailing CIA funding and control of the National S tudent Association. [11] A major Leary benefactor was stockbroker William Me llon Hitchcock, heir to the Gulf Oil fortune and nephew of Pittsburgh financier Andrew Mellon. Hitchcock turned over Mill brook, a 4,000 acre estate in Dutchess County, New York to L eary's International Federation for Internal Freedom. Asid e from their ranking among the rich and famous, the Mellon famil y has many connections to the American intelligence community, and Mellon family foundations have frequently been used as conduits for CIA money. Several members of the family were m embers of the OSS, and Richard Helms was a frequent guest of the Mellons while he was CIA director.

Sympathetic accounts of the period are generally bl ind to the more arcane political underpinnings of the acid era , but in this one the authors wonder, \"Was he simply a millionair e acid buff, a wayward son of the ruling class who dug Leary's tri p? Or did he have something else up his sleeve?\" Hitchcock, by my lights, had plenty up his sleeve. He was an associate of Bernie Cornfeld and Seymour (\"The Head \") Lazare, directors of the Swiss-based Investors Overseas Ser vices (IOS), a money laundry for the Mafia, Third World dictators, and the CIA. When a financial shortage was perceived at IOS, the ir assets were transferred to Robert Vesco, whose network of corporations are alleged to have been a CIA front b y William Spector, a former CIA operative. Hitchcock was also the single largest investor in t he Meyer Lansky-linked Resorts International, which in 1970 evolved a private intelligence operation known as Intertel, s prung from the same FBI Division Five and British intelligence nexus as Permindex, the umbrella corporation that apparently ran the John F. Kennedy hit. These connections will be expl ored later in this book. [13] Another of Hitchcock's associates was Ronald Hadley Stark, who appeared on the psychedelic scene in 1969 with yet another scheme to turn the entire world onto LSD. S tark was one more \"mystery man,\" with a number of cover stor ies and a seemingly unending bankroll for travelling and main taining an opulent lifestyle. He boasted that he worked for th e CIA, and there is no reason to doubt him in this matter. Stark financed a lab in Belgium that was the single largest underground manufacturing source for LSD at that ti me. He was seen at the student uprising in Paris in 1968, and was also present at the student demonstrations and labor str ikes in Milan in 1969. In the 1970s he lived a posh lifestyle in Italy, hobnobbing with Sicilian Mafiosi, espionage agents of various coloration, and terrorists. Stark was arrested by Italian police in Bologna in 1975, carrying what was suspected to be a vial of LSD, a key to a safe deposit box containing documents on the manufacture of acid, and friendly letters from a foreign service officer at the American embassy in London addressed to Stark's LSD lab in Belgium. 101"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"While in prison in Pisa, Stark arranged to inform o n Renato Curcio of the Red Brigades, telling of a plot to as sassinate Judge Francesco Coco of Genoa, who was going to preside o ver a trial of fifty Red Brigadesmen. In June of 1976 Judge Coc o was murdered, as Stark had foretold. Another possible v ictim of the Red Brigades was Italian premier Aldo Moro. Informa tion on Stark's involvement with this murder would later su rface, as well as testimony linking Stark to a PLO plan to la unch terrorist attacks on government embassies. Transferred to a jail in Bologna, Stark was the rec ipient of regular visits from British and American consulates , members of the Italian secret service, and the Libyan diplomat ic corps. Stark was also in close contact with General Vito M iceli, who at the time was on the CIA payroll. It is interesting that the American government never attempted to extradite St ark, who was wanted on drug charges in the United States. In June 1978 a Bologna magistrate, Graziano Gori, w as assigned to investigate Stark and his astounding we b of associates. A few weeks later, Gori was killed in a car wreck. Later, Stark was charged with \"armed banditry\" for his connections to terrorist activities, but he was rel eased from prison in April 1979 on the orders of Judge Giorgio Floridia. The reason for Floridia's order, according to the j udge, was \"an impressive series of scrupulously enumerated proofs \" that Stark was CIA. By the late 1960s the supply of ergotamine, one of the ingredients of LSD, had pretty well dried up. Synch ronistically, in 1964 Dow Chemical Company provided samples of th e vastly more potent STP to the US Army Chemical Corps at Ed gewood Arsenal. According to one chronicle of the period, \"In early 1967, for some inexplicable reason, the formula for STP was released to the scientific community at large... Sh ortly thereafter the drug was circulating in the hippie d istricts of San Francisco and New York.\" That \"inexplicable reason\" may have been hinted at in one of the thousands of CIA MKULT RA documents that were ordered shredded by CIA directo r Richard Helms, a classified manual titled \"LSD: Some Un-Psy chedelic Implications\". Another drug that \"inexplicably\" found its way to t he dealers, suddenly appearing in quantity in hippie conclaves around the U.S., was PCP, touted as being synthetic marijuana, but which was in fact \"Angel Dust.\" The army had tested PCP o n soldiers at Edgewood Arsenal in the late 1950s, and Dr. Ewen Cameron had used the drug on his subjects in his MKULTRA to rture 102"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"garden. [14] John Starr Cooke was another 60s notable who functi oned as a guru to some influentials in the Haight Ashbury s cene. Cooke is alleged to have been a leading Scientology opera tive and reportedly was close to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard in the early 50s. According to one account, Cooke was the first Scientology \"Clear,\" although another man, John McM asters, was the person publicly touted in this role some ye ars later—until he too had a falling out with \"the fat boy\" as he called Hubbard. Cooke's sister was married to Roger Kent, a leading light in the California Democratic Party, whose bro ther Sherman was head of the CIA's National Board of Estimates, and was CIA director Dulles' right hand man during the 50s. Coo ke is said to have regularly hobnobbed with other CIA personnel. From his digs in Cuernavaca, Mexico, Cooke sent for th members of a small group who called themselves the Psychedelic Rangers, imbued with the mission of tur ning on the world to acid. Among persons who visited Cooke in C uernavaca were Andrija Puharich, who ran drug experiments for the military in the 1950s and was a publicist for the I sraeli spoon- bending psychic Uri Geller; and the wealthy Seymour (\"The Head\") Lazare, an associate of William Mellon Hitch cock, and with Bernie Cornfeld, a director of the Swiss-based Investors Overseas Service (IOS). [15] A CIA vampire hanging around the acid scene in the 60s was the omnipresent—in mind control programs—Louis Joly on West, claimed to be the overall coordinator for all gover nment mind control programs. West, like George Hunter White be fore him, rented a San Francisco safehouse to \"study the hipp ies.\" One can only guess what kind of dirtywork he was up to. West has been employed over the years as a hired gu n to promote whatever position the CIA wants promoted. A fter the Kennedy assassination and the murder of Oswald by J ack Ruby, he was interviewed and not surprisingly dwelt on Ru by's \"lone nut\" characteristics. On the day of the Oklahoma Ci ty bombing, West went on the Larry King show to talk about alle ged bomber Tim McVeigh, again characterizing him as one more \" lone nut,\" i.e. not involved in a conspiracy. West again appea rs in an article in Los Angeles magazine, after the alleged murder b y O.J. Simpson of Nicole Simpson, a case rife with inconsi stencies and unexplained associated murders that have not been m entioned, much less explained, by the media. In the article W est invokes the highly imaginative \"Othello Syndrome,\" where bl ack men kill their white spouses, due to their belief that \"something 103"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"must be wrong with their Caucasian mates lor se eking love beyond the racial pale.\" [16] In the acid-induced glow of the Flower Generation t here were dissenting voices about the LSD experience, ev en famous ones. Some of the members of the earlier Beat Gener ation—who later became icons of the Flower Generation—had dou bts about the usefulness of psychedelics, seeing early on tha t the drug could be used as for control as well as liberation. William Burroughs—at one time active in Scientology—was giv en acid by Leary in Tangiers in 1961. He wrote of his misgivin gs about the drug in his book Nova Express, published in 1964: \"At the immediate risk of finding myself the most u npopular character of all fiction—and history is fiction—I m ust say this: \"Bring together state of news—Inquire onward from s tate to doer—Who monopolized Immortality? Who monopolized C osmic Consciousness? Who monopolized Love Sex and Dream? Who monopolized Time, Life and Fortune? Who took from y ou what is yours? ...Listen: Their Garden of Delights is a terminal sewer...Their Immortality Cosmic Consciousness and Love is second-run grade-B shit... Stay out of the Garden o f Delights... Throw back their ersatz Immortality... Flush their drug kicks down the drain—they are poisoning and monopolizing the hallucinogenic drugs—learn to make it without any c hemical corn.\" The poet Allen Ginsberg's initial reactions to LSD, administered to him by Dr. Charles Savage, who had worked on hallucinogenic experiments for the U.S. Navy, were similar to those of Burroughs. Given acid in a clinical enviro nment in Palo Alto, California, Ginsberg said, \"I thought that I was trapped in a giant web or network of forces beyond my control th at were perhaps experimenting with me or were perhaps from another planet or were from some super-government or cosmic military or science fiction Big Brother.\" John Sinclair, of the White Panthers, was purged of his belief in the acid religion through experience: \"It makes perfect sense to me. We thought at the time that as a result of o ur LSD- inspired activities great things would happen. And, of course, it didn't... They were up there moving that shit [i.e. LSD] around. Down on the street, nobody knew what was going on.\" Quite so. But even now, the identity of \"they\" has not been clarified. \"They\" apparently, ultimately, was Tav istock. 104"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"NOTES: 1.

This 301- page report was authored by 14 researchers, supervi sed by 23 controllers, that included cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, behaviorist B.F. Skinner, and Sir Geoffrey Vi ckers of the British armaments family and British intelligence. The basic point of the study was the same old New W orld Order news: the self-image of mankind must be chang ed away from industrial growth to spiritual values. Accordi ng to the study, \"Many of our present images appear to have b ecome dangerously obsolescent, however. An image may be a ppropriate for one phase in the development of a society, but once that stage is accomplished, the use of the image as a co ntinuing guide to action will likely create more problems th an it solves... Science, technology and economics have made possibl e really significant strides toward achieving such basic hum an goals as physical safety and security, material comfort and better health. But many of these successes have brought with them problems of being too successful—problems that themselves se em insoluble within the set of societal value-premises that led to their emergence... Our highly developed system of t echnology leads to higher vulnerability and breakdowns. Indee d the range and interconnected impact of societal problems that are now emerging pose a serious threat to our civilization. .. If [our] projections of the future prove correct, we can exp ect the associated problems of the trend to become more ser ious, more universal and to occur more rapidly.\" According to the Stanford study, \"Images and fundam ental conceptions of human nature and potentialit ies can have 107"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"enormous power in shaping the values and actions in a society We have attempted in this study to: \"(1) Illuminate ways our present society, its citiz ens, and institutions have been shaped by the underlying myt hs and images of the past and present. \"(2) Explore with respect to contemporary societal problems the deficiencies of currently held images of mankin d and to identify needed characteristics of future images. \"(3) Identify high-leverage activities that could f acilitate the emergence of new images and new policy approaches t o the resolution of key problems in society.\" I believe that dumping LSD on the populace of the p lanet was seen as one of those high-leverage activities. It w as a way of turning the masses away from apolitical activism th at might net them a share of the world pie, and toward the life of ecstatic mystic peasantry. The Tavistock-originated and CIA-funded Rand Corpor ation even sponsored studies reporting on the \"changes in dogma- tism\" and political motivation of LSD users. Accord ing to one report, authored by Rand's William McGlothlin, \"If some of the subjects are drawn from extreme right or leftwing o rganizations. it may be possible to obtain additional behavioral measure in terms of the number resigning or becoming inactive. \" [1] Another group that closely tracked the Flower Gener ation was the Hudson Institute, founded by Herman Kahn, w ho had received funding from the Human Ecology Fund, a CIA cutout. Kahn visited Millbrook and other centers of psyched elic activity, although he was far from an advocate of the benefit s of LSD. \"He was primarily interested in social control,\" stated one Hudson Institute consultant. It should be noted that some of the Tavistock-spons ored creators of the LSD culture, men like Tim Leary, ma y have felt that their motives were benign—LSD users tend to de velop a messiah complex in which they see acid as the solut ion to all the world's problems, and try to turn everyone on to th e drug—but the strategic underpinnings of those motives lay in the New World Order plans of the British elite. Leary and h is court were either witting or unwitting agents of Tavistock. Although the mass media vocally decry the idea that there could ever be a conspiracy of control functioning b ehind the scenes in society, the real members of the conspira cy are often quite straightforward in saying what is going on. M arilyn Ferguson, a protege of Willis Harmon who derived he r book The Aquarian Conspiracy from Harmon's Changing Images, talked 108"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"about how the Tavistock restructuring of the world would take place. She called it the SPIN principle, Segmented Polycentric Integrated Networks. Although she suggests the idea is new, it is obvious that it has been the approach of the New World Order since the beginning: \"This is a source of power never before tapped in h istory: multiple self-sufficient social movements linked fo r a whole array of goals whose accomplishment would transform every aspect of contemporary life. \"Because SPINs are so qualitatively different in or ganization and impact from bureaucracies... most people don't see them—or think they are conspiracies. Often networks take si milar actions without conferring with each other simply because t hey share so many assumptions. It might also be said that the sh ared assumptions are the collusion. \"The Aquarian Conspiracy is, in effect, a SPIN of S PINs, a network of many networks aimed at social transforma tion. The Aquarian Conspiracy is indeed loose, segmented, evo lutionary, redundant. Its center is everywhere. Although many social movements and mutual-help groups are represented in its alliances, its life does not hinge on any of them.\" The upshot of the Tavistock approach and where its SPIN of SPINs is heading is obvious. While a tiny percentag e of the population will continue to exist within their plus h Xanadus, the majority of the world will be reduced to subsistenc e standards of living, and denied the benefits of technology and i ndustry, although furnished with all the drugs they desire.

What ensues is Orwell's vision of 1984, a society o f total control: synthesis. During the Nixon presidency, agents of the Law Enfo rcement Assistance Administration, an arm of the U.S. Justi ce Department, had a roundtable with Richard Nixon, At torney General John Mitchell, H.R.

Among other programs that the LEAA had evolved were the development of a National Population Surveillance C omputer System, designed to monitor citizens of the U.S., a s well as measures to create a national police force, includi ng Operation Cable Splicer and Operation Garden Plot. [1] At the meeting bonds were forged for the linkage of LEAA funding, police state goals, and the NIMH. LEAA hen ceforth provided the cash for 350 NIMH projects related to \"mental health\" as it is so euphemistically called. Among p rojects funded were dozens of mind control and behavior mod programs in hospitals, prisons, and schools. These projects included a Department of Health, Education and Welfare program to screen all children on Medicaid for psychological problems ; programs to treat prison inmates with psychoactive drugs; sh ock treatment for child molesters at the Somers Correct ional Facility in Connecticut; psychosurgery programs on inmates in Michigan and California; the testing of a vomiting- inducing drug in prisoners who broke rules in Iowa; and the injec tion of the terror drug Anectine on prisoners in California. The bond between the LEAA and NIMH reportedly was s o tight that eventually the scientists of NIMH were under the 111"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"direct control of LEAA. Eventually this collaborati on changed the character of the LEAA itself, so that the organ ization was no longer fixated on martial law measures, but primari ly involved in mind control funding for aversion therapy, psychosu rgery, and behavior control through drugging. [2] In November 1974 the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, one of whose members was Con gressman Leo Ryan who was murdered at Jonestown, began inves tigation into the federal funding of behavior modification p rograms. Senator Sam Erwin, who headed the subcommittee, interrogated Donald E. Santarelli, the head of the LEAA, about the kind of projects that were being funded, result ing in an announcement by the organization that they would di scontinue providing cash for psychosurgery and other forms of mind control. Not that the pledge was heeded. At least 5 37 mind control programs, including operations involving ps ychosurgery continued to be funded. [3] LEAA was still in the business of mind control when Dr. Louis Jolyon (\"Jolly\") West, chairman of the Department o f Psychiatry at the University of California at Los Angeles and director of the Neuropsychiatric Institute, proposed to California Governor Ronald Reagan the creation of a Center for the Stud y and Reduction of Violence. The original idea for violence research centers was birthed in the mind of CIA and FBI agent William Herrmann, emp loyed by the Systems Development Corporation, and a counter- insurgency advisor to Governor Reagan. Herrman had worked at the Rand Corporation, the Hoover Center on Violence , and the Stanford Research Institute. During the Vietnam war Herrmann had worked in psy-ops in Vietnam and Cambodia, prob ably as a member of the Operation Phoenix assassination progr am, responsible for the death of thousands of Vietnames e. Herrman has also been identified as an international arms d ealer who traded with Iran in 1980, and who may have been inv olved in the October Surprise. In 1995 Herrman was serving a n eight- year prison term in England for an alleged CIA coun terfeiting operation. His M.O., in short, reads as if he is a member of the Octopus as delineated by the murdered journalist Da nny Casolaro. [4] In 1970, Hermann is reported to have acted as contr ol agent to Colston Westbrook, a Black CIA psychological war fare expert who had been involved in Operation Phoenix—quite a coincidence, that.

West brook had formed the Black Cultural A ssociation at Vacaville Medical Facility, a euphemistically-na med prison in California that was the site of a Maximum Psychiatr ic Diagnostic Unit (termed a maxi-maxi in prison parlance) where extensive drug behavior modification research had been done. It is alleged that there was a mind control assassination program at Vacaville, where men were programmed to murder prominent Black s, including Oakland School Superintendent Marcus Fost er, and Black Panthers Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. [5] Donald DeFreeze, who between 1967 and 1969 had been employed by the L.A. Police Department's Public Dis order Unit, was the black organizer for the Black Cultural Asso ciation at Vacaville. Westbrook was the man who dubbed DeFreez e \"Cinque Mtume,\" meaning \"fifth prophet,\" and who de signed the seven-headed cobra logo for the group that Cinq ue later headed up: the Symbionese Liberation Army. [6] Another Phoenix Program alumnus who backed the Viol ence Center in a big way was Dr. Earl Brian, Secretary o f Health under Governor Reagan. Brian was involved in October Surp rise, the illegalities and murders at the Cabazon Indian rese rvation in Indio, California, and the theft of the Inslaw PROM IS software, and was identified as a member of the \"Octopus\" int ernational crime cabal by murdered journalist Danny Casolaro. The head of the violence control center would be Lo uis Jolyon West. West's background in mind control-rela ted research goes back to the antediluvian days of MKUL TRA. A CIA memorandum entitled \"Interrogation Techniques,\" fro m January 14, 1953, includes the following note: \"If the services of Major Louis J. West, USAF (MC), a trained hypnotist, can be obtained, and another man well gr ounded in conventional psychological interrogation and polygr aph techniques, and the services of Lt. Col. [deleted], a well-balanced interrogation research center could be established in an especially selected location.\" [7] Aldous Huxley, writing in 1957, also mentioned West , indicating that he had been doing research with hyp nosis and mescaline. In 1961 Huxley commented that West had b een experimenting with sense deprivation and noted his state of the art research facilities. West is also known to have directed a CIA-funded LSD research program in the 1960s at the University of Oklahoma, and to have run a safehouse of unspecified function in Haight Ashbury at the heigh t of the hippie scene. West was the psychiatrist who examined Jack Ruby, the 113"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"assassin of Lee Harvey Oswald, ordering that Ruby b e treated for mental problems, quite possibly as a means to shut Ruby up in his claims that a conspiracy was responsible for th e killing of John Kennedy. [8] West was even involved recently in the \"remote view ing\" experiments of Project Grill Flame, conducted by St anford Research Institute. Due to a certain amount of noto riety, one suspects, the man is currently going by the name \"L .J. West,\" and can be seen acting as a hired gun promoting the government line on occasional television news progr ams. After the announcement of the plans for the Violenc e Center, West dashed out a letter to then-California Directo r of Health, J.M. Stubblebine. It said: \"Dear Stub, \"I am in possession of confidential information tha t the Army is prepared to turn over Nike missile bases to stat e and local agencies for non-military purposes. They may look w ith special favor on health-related applications. \"Such a Nike missile base is located in the Santa M onica Mountains, within a half-hour's drive of the Neurop sychiatric Institute. It is accessible, but relatively remote. The site is securely fenced, and includes various buildings and improvements, making it suitable for prompt occupan cy. \"If this site were made available to the Neuropsych iatric Institute as a research facility, perhaps initially as an adjunct to the new Center for the Prevention of Violence, we c ould put it to very good use. Comparative studies could be carr ied out there, in an isolated but convenient location, of e xperimental or model programs for the alteration of undesirable be havior. \"Such programs might include drug or alcohol abuse, modification of chronic anti-social or impulsive ag gressiveness, etc. The site could also accommodate conferences or retreats for instruction of selected groups of mental-health related professionals and of others (e.g., law enforcement personnel, parole officers, special educators) for whom both d emonstration and participation would be effective modes of instr uction. \"My understanding is that a direct request by the G overnor, or other appropriate officers of the State, to the Secretary of Defense (or, of course, the President) could be mos t likely to produce prompt results.\" Among the programs that West foresaw as taking plac e at the Violence Center were genetic, neurophysiological, a nd biochemical studies of violent persons, studies on so-called \"hyperkinetic\" or \"hyperactive\" children, \"hormon al aspects of 114"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"passivity and aggressiveness in boys,\" and surveys of \"norms of violence among various ethnic groups.\" Also propose d was \"implanting tiny electrodes deep within the brain\" for the monitoring and control of violent subjects. West ha d gotten tentative approval for a grant of $750,000 from the LEAA for the Violence Center, the money reportedly raised by all eged Octopoid Dr. Earl Brian. [9] Reagan was so enthralled by the idea for the center that he included it in his January 11 State of the State ad dress. Reagan said that the center \"will explore all types of vio lent behavior, what causes it, how it may be detected, prevented, controlled, and treated.\" [10] So far as we know, West's Violence Center was never activated, at least in the grandiose scale he propo sed. Because of unwanted attention from civil liberties groups a nd, in particular, the Subcommittee on Constitutional Righ ts involved in investigating CIA mind control abuse, LEAA chang ed its policy to exclude funding \"for psychosurgery, medical rese arch, behavior modification—including aversion therapy—an d chemotherapy.\" West was still seeking funding for t he center in April 1974, but with Watergate in the news, the moo d among politicians was such that they did not want to take any chances with potentially unpopular funding proposals.

As part of this research, Coun ter- intelligence Director James Jesus Angleton defined three goals in hypnosis programs run by the CIA: (1) the speedy hypnotic induction of unwitting subjects. (2) the ability to create long- lasting amnesia. (3) the implanting of long-lasting , useful hypnotic suggestions. [1] Dr. George Estabrooks, the chairman of the Departme nt of Psychology at Colgate University, was involved in e arly OSS experiments in hypnosis. His boast was, \"I can hypn otize a man without his knowledge or consent into committing tr eason against the United States.\" Estabrooks informed a group of officials in Washing ton that 200 hypnotists with the right stuff could unleash a n army of hypnotized agents in the U.S. during wartime. He la id out, in fact, a scenario in which the entire U.S. military could be taken over by a handful of mind controlled fifth columnis ts. Hypnotizing volunteer soldiers of reported low rank and education, Estabrooks showed how they could be prog rammed to retain complex verbal information. In confirmati on of Estabrooks' thesis, subsequent testing by J.G. Watk ins on army volunteers showed that these men could be, contrary to popular wisdom on the topic, hypnotized to commit acts that violated their own moral codes, not to mention military code s. One experiment that Watkins carried out involved hypnotizing army privates, and then telling them th at an officer who was in the same room was an enemy infiltrator. Watkins told the hypnotized subjects that the officer would try to kill 117"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"them. Without exception, on command the soldiers vi olently attacked the officer. In one case, the subject pull ed out a knife and tried to stab the officer. [2] In February, 1954 Morse Allen, the head of Project BLUEBIRD, continued this line of experimentation in creating a \"disposable\" assassin, to be activated with mind co ntrol and then \"terminated with extreme prejudice.\" At about the same time the CIA funded research by Alden Sears at the University of Minnesota, and later at the University of Denver. S ears' focus was the installation of multiple personalities in h is experimental subjects. [3] Sheffield Edwards was the security officer for the CIA's Project ARTICHOKE. During this period the CIA colla borated with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN), one of whose members, Charles Sirgusa, was involved in setting u p safehouses for later MKULTRA experiments. In 1960 Edwards cont acted Siragusa for help in locating paid assassins for th e murder of certain foreign leaders—whether hypnosis would be e mployed was not specifically indicated. Siragusa was not wi lling to take part in the recruitment, so Edwards turned to Rober t Maheu, a top Howard Hughes aide and ex-FBI agent. Maheu cont acted Mafia members Sam Giancana and John Roselli to assi st him in obtaining hired hands for, in this case, the elimin ation of Fidel Castro. The Castro assassination schemes were developed in the Technical Services Division (TSS) of the CIA, overs een by the head of MKULTRA, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb. In late 1961 the CIA's assassination programs, operating under the title Z R-RIFLE, were handed to William Harvey by Richard Helms, the man who had come up with the idea for MKULTRA in the first place. At the same time that TSS was involved in assassinatio n and the recruitment of assassination squads, it was also in volved in an expanded program of research into hypnosis. [4] Lieutenant Commander Thomas Narut, a U.S. Navy psychologist stationed at the U.S. Regional Medical Center in Naples, Italy, in 1979 admitted to Navy programs to create mind controlled assassins. Narut made this apparent gaff e at the NATO conference for psychologists on \"Dimensions of Stress and Anxiety\" in Oslo, Norway. The topic Narut spoke on at the conference was \"The Use of a Symbolic Model and Verbal Intervention in Inducin g and Reducing Stress,\" but his spiel was mostly about th e benefits of doing research for the Navy. One thing he mentioned was that there was no shortage of enlisted men who could be studied, 118"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"with psych profiles and background available on all subjects. Afterwards, in a small group that included Peter Wa tson of the London Sunday Times, Narut was more candid abou t what the Navy was up to. He talked about his work with \" combat readiness units,\" whose participants included comma ndos and undercover operatives at U.S. embassies worldwide, including \"hit men and assassins.\" According to Narut, these men were desensitized by being strapped into a chair with th eir heads immobilized and eyelids clamped open, while they we re forced to view violent true life splatter flicks, until fi nally the men were totally callous toward scenes of horrible carnage. Among the films shown were a brutal African circumcision, and a man having his fingers sawed off in a sawmill. Another technique of desensitization that was employed was propaganda ai med to make the customs and culture of another country app ear as evil and less than human. Narut stated that successful p rogramming of assassins took only a few weeks. Candidates for assassination training were taken fr om submarine crews and paratroops, but included convic ted murderers from military prisons. Another source of mind control fodder for the assassination programs was s oldiers who had been awarded for bravery. Narut said that the m en selected were programmed at the Navy neuropsychiatric lab in San Diego, California, and also at the Naples, Italy medical i nstallation. Although Narut admitted that he did not have a high enough clearance to know where all of the programmed assas sins were sent, he did know that some had been stationed in t he Naples embassy—this would have provided for easy deploymen t throughout Europe. [5] After Narut's admissions were printed in the Sunday Times, the Pentagon issued an official denial that the Nav y had ever conducted \"psychological training\" or the training of assassins. Although admitting that Narut was on Naval staff in Naples, they reported that they had been unable to locate him in order to obtain a response to the allegations. A short time later Narut gave a press conference in which he stated that the information he had offered had only been theoretical—these were the kind of programs that the Navy might do in the future. Soon after, the U.S. Naval headquarters in London reported that Nar ut's rash statements had been made due to his \"personal probl ems.\" This was almost certainly not true. Dr. Irwin Saras on, one of the organizers of the Oslo conference, admitted that a few years earlier he had been solicited by the Navy to partic ipate in a project similar to the one Narut described. [6] 119"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Daniel Sheehan of the Christie Institute public adv ocacy group also verifies this kind of research: \"We have talked to half- a-dozen individuals who have told a startlingly sim ilar story about how, at a very young age, usually between twenty an d twenty-five, they were contacted, usually within the context of military training, and told: 'Look, we've got a special deal for you. You're going to come into the service under the normal des ignation of being an infantryman but you're going to leave the service after a while and you're going to have special training, an d you're going to be brought into a special program. They're sent to special places where they are trained by mercenaries and th en they're told: 'You're going to be called upon from time to time to do some things for us.'\" According to Sheehan, one young man was contacted a t an army recruiting station and then turned over to an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. His missi on was to infiltrate a motorcycle gang and kill the leader of a rival gang, causing both of the gangs to fight and hopefully de stroy each other. The man was also sent to a training camp in Hawaii, where training was being done for an assassination that was to take place in Central America. [7] Another man, a 43-year-old German psychologist and doctor of economic and social sciences who chooses to rema in anonymous, believes that he has been, since a child , the subject of mind control procedures. These include Cameron-s tyle \"depatterning\" treatments using electroshock and ps ychic driving, drug hypnosis, ELF programming, and a drug capable of inducing near-death experiences. One of the techniques he describes is aversive ther apy using a \"torture trouser,\" an electrical torture device tha t is \"sort of a loin cloth made of leather and steel bonds by which an electrode is fastened to the genitals of the victim. For elec tric supply they use a cable or a battery so that you can freely mov e and if the torturer wants to torture you he sends an electric signal to the battery using a transmitter.\" He states that, \"In 1972, they tried to use me as a n undercover zombie who should infiltrate German terr orist troops... Who were they? They said they were the Mo ssad and the Shabak. I was kidnapped and brought to an inter rogation camp in a desert... I strongly believe that I was a victim of an international secret service and psychiatry coopera tion headed by the Pentagon in the name of 'national security'. .. \"I clearly object to the suspicion that the organiz ation behind this assault on human rights comes from outer space or has 120"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"something to do with t h e Illuminati or another kind of conspiracy. I don't believe that aliens have visite d our planet, but if aliens exist they are probably not so cruel as our human, all-too-human controllers... \"It is my strong belief that the basic ideas of min d control and human robot production stem from German KZs. I don't know who the Werner von Braun of KZ psychiatry was who was hired by the U.S. intelligence agencies after the w ar, but the modus operandi of mind control makes me believe tha t initially a potent Nazi brain was hidden behind it...\" [8] Another man apparently programmed as a mind control led assassin was Colonel William Bishop, who made the f ollowing statement to researcher Gary Shaw in 1983: \"That was how, after the Korean War, I got involved with CIA. I have been subjected to every known type of drug. The medical doctors connected with the agency found that certai n drugs work quite well in conjunction with hypnosis—hypnot ic power of suggestion—with some subjects. It did with me. I sp eak with absolute certainty and knowledge and experience tha t this is not only possible, but did and is taking place today. \"I never understood why they selected me personally . There were any number of psychological or emotional facto rs involved in people's selection. Antisocial behavior patterns , paranoid or the rudiments of paranoia, and so on. But when they are successful with this programming—or, for lack of a better term, indoctrination—they could take John Doe and get thi s man to kill George and Jane Smith. He will be given all th e pertinent information as to their location, daily habits, etc . Then there is a mental block put on this mission in his mind. He remembers nothing about it. \"Perhaps a month or a year later—rarely over a year , at least back in those days—the phone rings. A code word wil l be read to him in a voice that John Doe recognizes. That wi ll trigger the action. John Doe will commit the assassination, ret urn home, and remember absolutely nothing of it. It is totall y a blank space. \"Now, there is a problem with this, and they never found a way that I know of to overcome it. From time to tim e—it happens to me now—I will see faces, names, places, gunfire, for which there is no rational explanation. I went back for deprogramming. In these sessions, they explain that this does happen from time to time, not to worry about it, ju st clear your mind and forget it. \"I know men who gradually lost their sight, or some of their 121"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"hearing, or the use of their vocal cords. Some had chronic constipation. For entirely psychological reasons, n ot physical, because inadvertently these mental blocks developed . I myself became totally impotent. For obvious reasons, I don 't care to go into this in any greater detail.\" Bishop died of heart failure a few days after autho rizing the release of a tape recording that included the above statement.

Russell Model Candy Jones: Mind control victim or mind control hoax? 122"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Chapter 16: SO LIKE CANDY The story of Candy Jones is ubiquitous in the liter ature of mind control, and has been repeated by virtually every r esearcher who has written a book on the subject. Here is Candy's story, related in a book authored by Donald Bain, The Control of C andy Jones: [1] During World War II Candy had been one of the most popular pin-up girls in America. Touring the Pacific with t he USO she caught undulant fever and malaria and was hospitali zed in Manila. There she met a medical officer identified in Bain's book by a pseudonym, \"Gil Jensen.\" He would later b e one of her contacts in the world of CIA mind control. In 1959 Candy started a modeling agency in the Unit ed States and, in regards to an office burglary, was c ontacted by an FBI man. Noting a microphone that she used for tapi ng the voices of models, the FBI agent asked to borrow it, and Candy assented. Later the same FBI man convinced the woma n to allow her modeling school to be used as an FBI mail drop. Candy Jones was later a courier for a piece of government mail that she took across the country. Shortly thereafter, she wa s recontacted by \"Gil Jensen,\" the same man whom she had met in t he Philippines. \"Jensen\" invited her to work for the C IA, and she accepted. In 1973 Candy Jones married \"Long John\" Nebel, a po pular radio talk show host who specialized in stories of UFOs and other outre subjects. On their wedding night, Nebel watched Candy go through a transformation into another pers on, this one cruel and cold; but the mood passed. The next eveni ng, however, the cruel mood returned, then again faded away. Jones was also plagued by insomnia, and Nebel hypno tized his wife, opening up a Pandora's box. Candy had apparen tly had an abusive childhood, and had developed an alter ego n amed Arlene. This was the \"transformation\" that Nebel ha d observed, Candy turning into Arlene. 123"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"During hypnosis Candy also revealed her contact wit h \"Dr. Jensen,\" her regular hypnosis sessions with him, an d the injections he had given her of what he had called \" vitamins.\" She spoke of having to sign a government security o ath, training in espionage work that she had undergone at a CIA c amp, and her experiences as a split-personality courier, man ipulated through hypnosis and drugs, and plying her twilight trade under a number of pseudonyms. She also recalled being tor tured with electric shock by Chinese men in Taiwan over the co ntents of one of the messages she had delivered. Candy Jones spoke of being one among several female CIA zombies who were tortured at CIA headquarters in La ngley, Virginia. During the course of her deprogramming by Nebel, Candy revealed that she had been programmed to comm it suicide on December 31, 1972 in Nassau, Bahamas, af ter her use to the CIA was over. Nebel's marriage had circumven ted the trip and saved Candy's life. According to the book by Bains, Candy was still struggling with her alter-ego Arlen e at the time of the writing of the book. Investigators contacting the CIA seeking informatio n on Candy Jones via the Freedom of Information Act have been turned out in the cold. Although the CIA does have a file on Jones, it will not release any portion of it. If the mind control programming of Candy Jones is t rue, then it is powerful testimony for many of the mind contr ol atrocity stories to follow, stories such as told by Cathy O' Brien in Trance Formation of America. The trouble is that although the story of Candy Jones is cited in virtually every book on min d control ever written, in all probability it is a hoax. Author Paris Flammonde, who was a close friend of L ong John Nebel, and who was the producer of Nebel's radio sh ow for several years, is one of the persons who has said t hat Bains' The Control of Candy Jones is a hoax. In 1990 Flammonde wrote, \"During a series of walks and lunches, John often s poke about, and we batted about ideas regarding a bizarre and c ommercial book about Candy. Briefly he toyed with considerati on of my doing something along those lines (since I had ghos ted a book for him earlier), but the thought was discarded for several reasons, the main one being that Candy did not espe cially care for me, contending to him that, even though I no lo nger had anything to do with the broadcast, he tended to let me 'influence' him. \"And I am happy to grant that the more I realized h ow 'far out' he wanted the 'fact book' to be, the mo re completely 124"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"uninterested I became. In any event, the vast major ity of the text is nonsense, and what little is true would be difficult to identify and impossible for the uninitiated—and pro fitless. The more vulgar, spiteful, and contemptible of the spec ulations are not worthy of comment—even by one who observed Cand y to be a genuinely impossible individual at times, occasiona lly shudderingly coldblooded, and devoid of talkshow ho sting talent.\" [2] UFO investigator Jim Moseley knew both Nebel (who d ied of cancer in 1978) and Candy Jones (who also died of c ancer, in 1989) for many years, and appeared on Nebel's WMCA radio show \"hundreds of times\" in relation to his researc h into UFOs. Moseley spoke out about his knowledge of the Candy Jones mind control case calling it \"a crock of shit.\" He state d that his opinion had been confirmed by Sandy Teller, who had been Nebel's assistant for many years, and a friend of t he man who had ghostwritten the Candy Jones volume. [3] As such, the story of Candy Jones, cannot be consid ered to be proven factual. NOTES: 1. The title of this chapter is taken from the Elvi s Costello song of the same name 2. \"Saucer Smear,\" ed.

His experiments included the insertion of fine electric ally conductive wires into the brains of anaesthetized c ats. To no- one's great surprise, given mild electrical stimula tion the cats went berserk. [1] Jose Delgado, funded by Yale University, the Office of Naval Intelligence, the U.S. Air Force 6571st Aeromedical Research Laboratory, and other institutions, and linked to S panish fascist groups by researcher John Judge, carried Hess' rese arch a great deal farther. Delgado was the first to specialize i n the implantation of electronic devices directly into th e brain. [2] Delgado's early experiments in the 1950s involved r igidly locking the head of an animal or human in a metal c lamp, and then plunging a long needle or needles into the bra in. Once the needle was in place, electricity or chemicals were injected through it. Later experiments used what he termed \" trans- dermal stimoceivers,\" tiny radio broadcasting/recei ving units that were buried entirely into the brains of animal s and humans, and carried electrical impulses to the brain, as we ll as broadcasting the subject's reactions back to a comp uter. Delgado described the capabilities of such instrume ntation in the early stages of his research: \"Microminiaturization of the instrument's electroni c components permits control of all parameters of exc itation for radio stimulation of three different points within the brain and also telemetric recording of three channels of intr acerebral electrical activity. In animals, the stimoceiver ma y be anchored to the skull, and different members of a colony can be studied without disturbing their spontaneous relations with in a group. Behavior such as aggression can be evoked or inhib ited. In 127"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"[human] patients, the stimoceiver may be strapped t o the head bandage, permitting electrical stimulation and moni toring of intracerebral activity without disturbing spontaneo us activities.\" [3] Delgado stated further, \"It is... already possible to induce a large variety of responses, from motor effects to e motional reactions and intellectual manifestations, by direc t electrical stimulation of the brain. Also, several investigato rs have learned to identify patterns of electrical activity (which a computer could also recognize) localized in specific areas o f the brain and related to determined phenomena such as perception of smells or visual perception of edges and movements. We are advancing rapidly in the pattern recognition of electrical co rrelates of behavior and in the methodology for two-way radio c ommun- ication between brain and computers... \"The individual is defenseless against direct manip ulation of the brain because he is deprived of his most intima te mechanisms of biological reactivity. In experiments , electrical stimulation of appropriate intensity always prevail ed over free will; and, for example, flexion of the hand evoked by stimulation of the motor cortex cannot be voluntarily avoided. Destruction of the frontal lobes produced changes in effectiven ess which are beyond any personal control.\" But far from being an incredible invasion of the su bject's life, Delgado reassured by stating that some subjects wer e more concerned about the cosmetics of the matter: \"Leaving wires inside of a thinking brain may appea r unpleasant or dangerous, but actually the many pati ents who have undergone this experience have not been concer ned about the fact of being wired, nor have they felt any dis comfort due to the presence of conductors in their heads. Some wom en have shown their feminine adaptability to circumstances by wearing attractive hats or wigs to conceal their electrical headgear, and many people have been able to enjoy a normal life a s outpatients, returning to the clinic periodically for examinatio n and stimulation. In a few cases in which contacts were located in pleasurable areas, patients have had the opportunit y to stimulate their own brains by pressing the button of a portab le instrument, and this procedure is reported to have therapeutic benefits.\" [4] Delgado admitted that not all subjects reacted with such equanimity: \"During depth explorations, it was demo nstrated that crises of assaultive behavior similar to the p atient's spontaneous bursts of anger could be elicited by ra dio stimu- lation of contact 3 in the right amygdala. A 1.2 mi lliamperes 128"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"excitation of tills point was applied while she was playing the guitar and singing with enthusiasm and skill. At th e seventh second of stimulation, she threw away the guitar an d in a fit of rage launched an attack against the wall and then p aced around the floor for several minutes, after which she grad ually quieted down and resumed her usual cheerful behavior.\" Delgado's experiments ultimately had very little to do with medicine and his touted \"therapy\". Delgado set up a one and one-half acre preserve on an island in the Bermudas , wherein the effects of stimoceivers could be tested in the manipulation of a gibbon colony and the interactions of their socia l hierarchies. \"The old dream of an individual overpowering the st rength of a dictator by remote control has been fulfilled, at least in our monkey colonies,\" Delgado wrote, \"by a combination of neurosurgery and electronics, demonstrating the pos sibility of intraspecies instrumental manipulation of hierarchi cal organization...\" He speculates that, \"in the near f uture the stimoceiver may provide the essential link from man to computer to man, with a reciprocal feedback between neurons and instruments which represents a new orientation for the medical control of neurophysiological functions.\" [ 5] Social controller that he was, Delgado's main beef was with man's will, i.e. his freedom: \"We may conclude that ESB [Electrical Stimulation of the Brain] can activate and influence some of the cerebral mechanisms involved in willful behavior. In this way we are able to investigate the neuronal fu nctions related to the so-called will, and in the near future this experimental approach should permit clarification of such highly controversial subjects as 'freedom,' 'individuality,' and 'sponta neity' in factual terms rather than in elusive semantic discussions.\" Delgado's revolution, what he calls a \"master contr ol of human behavior,\" is apparently not intended to be a democratic one: \"The contention that an ideal society should b e 'well behaved' may be disputed by many and in any case re quires a clarification... In some old plantations slaves beh aved very well, worked hard, were submissive to their masters, and were probably happier than some of the free blacks in mo dern ghettos. In several dictatorial countries the gener al population is skillful, productive, well behaved, and perhaps as happy as those in more democratic societies.\" The open publication of Delgado's book Physical Co ntrol of the Mind met with a decidedly cool reaction from th e public, and this may have warned other researchers in the f ield to keep quiet about the subject. To this day, Delgado 's is the only 129"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"popular book on the subject of implants and electri cal stimulation of the brain (ESB). [6] Although Delgado went on to, in his mind, better th ings, namely the use of direct electromagnetic irradiatio n of the brain, research into radio-controlled direct cerebr al stimulation was not discontinued. Dr. Stuart Mackay, a colleagu e of Delgado and author of the book, Bio-Medical Telemetry, stat ed, \"Among the many telemetry instruments being used today are miniature radio transmitters that can be swallowed, carried e xternally, or surgically implanted in man or animals. Recent deve lopments include pressure transmitters, ultrasonic and radio units for free-swimming dolphins, units for tracking wild ani mals, and pill-sized transmitters of many designs and functio ns that can operate continuously for several years. The scope o f observations that can be made is too broad to more than hint at with a few examples. Transmitters introduced throug h normal body openings in the human can sense pH in the stom ach, the site of bleeding along the gastrointestinal tract, radiation intensity, the pressure changes in the bladder due to micturition, the pressure of teeth grinding togethe r during sleep, vaginal temperature, and the like. Human and subhuman species have been studied, as have aquatic and terr estrial animals, cold- and warm-blooded animals, and so on. Some transmitters need only send their signal for an hou r, whereas others are expected to transmit continuously for a year or more... It is hoped that these few preliminary word s will give a feeling for the scope of this activity... The possi bilities are limited only by the imagination of the investigator .\" [7] During the latter days of MKULTRA research, a CIA memorandum, dated 22 November, 1961, announced, \"In itial biological work on techniques and brain locations e ssential to providing conditioning and control of animals has b een completed. The feasibility of remote control of act ivities in several species of animals has been demonstrated. T he present investigations are directed toward improvement of t echniques and will provide a precise mapping of the useful br ain centers in selected species. The ultimate objective of this re search is to provide an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the directional control of animals and to provide pract ical systems suitable for human application.\" Did the mind control shrinks ever succeed in hardwi ring anyone with their implants outside of helpless pati ents locked away in asylums by and for the insane? Absolutely. The Los Angeles Herald Examiner for March 21, 1979 130"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"describes one swell ease. Leonard Kille was an elec tronics engineer and co-inventor of the Land camera. In 196 6 Kille rightly came to believe that his wife was having an affair with another man, and his distress over the matter was i nterpreted by psychiatrists as a \"personality pattern disturba nce.\" Kille was thought to be \"dangerous\" and was referre d to CIA shrinks Vernon Mark and Frank Ervin. It is not know n whether funding parameters played a part in their decision, but Mark and Ervin came to the conclusion that the best solution for Kille's problems was an electronic brain implant. Although Kille at first thought the solution excessive, his wife threatened divorce if he didn't take the cure. Predictably, after Kille got his brain wired she divorced him anyway and married the man she had been having an affair with. Kille had four electrical strands implanted in his brain, each strand studded with about 20 electrode stimoceivers . The electrodes were used to diddle Kille's brain with c urrent, adjusting his emotions at will. Dr. Peter Breggin o f the Center to Study Psychiatry investigated Kille's case after he had been implanted, and found that the man alternated betwee n a vegetative state and nightmares that he would again be operated on and be implanted with additional 'trodes. In 1971 an attendant at the Veteran's Administratio n hospital happened upon Kille, who had placed a wastebasket o n his head to \"stop the microwaves.\" The Veterans Administrati on doctors had not been told that Kille had been implanted—a m atter of national security, perhaps—and so assumed that he w as stark raving. The VA doctors ordered additional \"treatmen ts\" on Kille that left him paralyzed from the waist down. [8] Robert Naeslund is another victim of Delgado's tech nology. He believes that in 1967, while undergoing surgery in Stockholm, Sweden, he was implanted with mind contr ol devices. Naeslund reports that the implant was plac ed there by Dr. Curt Strand, injected through a nasal passage. Naeslund contacted the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare p rotesting the non-consensual experimentation, but when the do ctors heard his story he was predictably declared mentall y ill and locked away in a mental hospital. After securing release from the hospital, Naeslund showed a number of Swedish doctors x-rays of his head that e ven to a layman plainly exhibit small unnatural objects in h is head, but the doctors to a man declared the x-rays to be norm al. It was not until 1983 that Professor P.A. Lindstrom, at th e University of California in San Diego examined the x-rays and wro te, \"I can 131"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"only confirm that some foreign objects, most likely brain transmitters, have been implanted at the base of yo ur frontal brain and in the skull. In my opinion, there is no excuse for such implantations. I fully agree with Lincoln Lawr ence who, in his book [Were We Controlled?] on page 27, wrote, ' There are two particularly dreadful procedures which have bee n developed, those working and playing with them secr etly call them R.H.I.C. and E.D.O.M.—Radio-Hypnotic Intracere bral Control and Electronic Dissolution of Memory.'\" After Lindstrom attested to the fact that there wer e foreign objects in Naeslund's head, ten other doctors came forward verifying their existence. In 1985 Naeslund delivered a petition with 50 signa tures to the Swedish Director of Public Prosecutions, inform ing him of the implanting of mind control devices in Sweden an d demanding that the practice be stopped. Naeslund wa s also one of several persons responsible for placing an adver tisement in 30 Swedish newspapers, exposing the situation of mi nd control. Apparently his activism brought Naeslund back to th e attention of whomever was responsible for the implants. This time they had something different in store for the man. Naeslund writes, \"At about the same time the first advertisement was published, I noticed a radiation or frequency which seemed to rise up from below my flat. In the mornings it felt as though my face, shoulders and back had been sunburned. If I laid a sheet of paper on the floor, it would, after only a matter of hours, begin to roll itself up from both ends and all battery-operated equipment rapidly were quickly dra ined of power. The waves increased until I was forced to mo ve out into a friend's flat. \"I hired another flat at Kocksgatan 38 in Stockholm where, for the first two weeks, everything was fine. By th e first of May, however, the trouble started again. The effects wer e much the same; the feelings of burning heat and noticeable b urns on the face after just an hour and the spreading of the se nsation into the palate, throat and lungs. Paper rolled itself u p whether hanging on the wall or lying on the floor—but now I also experienced how my blood circulation was being affe cted. I wrote of my last days in the flat: 'The radiation h as increased for the last two weeks and now, the 29th of May, it is completely unthinkable to sleep here. It is possible to be in the flat for at most two hours, but after that one has to leave bec ause the pain in the lungs, the dehydration, the dry cough, and g eneral weakness.' 132"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"\"Due to critical conditions caused by SAPO's [Swedi sh Secret Police] radiation, I was forced to abandon my effor ts to expose their electromagnetic terrorism. It was to be five years before I resumed the fight.\" Unable to locate a doctor in Sweden who was willing to remove the implants in his head, Naeslund travelled to Djakarta, Indonesia. \"On August 4, 1987,\" he remembers, \"I vi sited St. Carolus Hospital, Ji Salemba, Djakarta, and I met P rofessor Hendayo to whom I showed my x-rays, as well as repo rts from various doctors. He, obviously, could see the impla nted foreign objects and more x-rays taken the same day confirme d the fact, so Dr. Hendayo agreed to operate. I stayed at the h ospital until the following day. They took blood tests, etc., and informed me to come back on August 11th. \"On the morning of the 12th, I was shown to the ope rating room. Right outside of the door, I met Dr. Hendayo. He told me that something had happened which would cause the postponement of the operation. He would not say why . Considering how important this was to me, I insiste d that he keep his part of the agreement and do the operation . His behavior and attitude that morning was much differe nt than earlier. The complaisance and friendliness of the p revious meeting were gone, replaced by irritation and stres s. But he changed his mind and agreed to perform the operatio n. As soon as we entered the operating ward, two people entere d from another room; they were Western middle-aged men. On e of them had a syringe and gave me the sedative without a word or any preparation. \"In the middle of the operation I awoke with a horr ible pain in my head. My arms and legs were secured with stra ps. One person held my head steady, while another held open the 5 cm. incision in my forehead with some sort of instrumen t. A third person held an object, resembling a branding iron u sed on animals, which he burned into my head. During the 4 5 seconds of the operation in which I was awake, I experience d the feeling that my head was being blown to bits. I screamed in pain and tried to free my arms and legs. I fell unconscious from the pain and shock. The next thing I knew, it was 2 a.m. and I could feel my brain on fire. This was 18 hours after the ope ration. \"The next morning I went to the hospital's radiolog y department and asked the doctor to x-ray my head. T he picture showed the injury and that there was a foreign obje ct in the damaged area. I went to the chief physician and tol d him what had happened. Afterward, I visited Dr. Hendayo an d he told me, 133"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"\"It wasn't my idea to do this... I had no choice... You should have listened to me and postponed the operation... Your country's secret police was involved...\" \"The reason the operation turned out the way it did is quite clear. Prof. Hendayo was, at first, in favor of the operation. But the Swedish Secret Police (SAPO) followed me via mi nd control and they knew every step I took. When Dr. Hendayo p romised to operate on me, SAPO also knew. In order to stop me, they informed their CIA colleagues in Indonesia, who for bade the doctor to help me, or they threatened to expose the m. That was why the doctor could not say why he wanted to postp one the operation. SAPO/CIA had obviously wanted to warn me and show that there were other powers behind the decision. N ow, five years later, I have physical pain in the area which was damaged. In addition, my mental and psychological abilities have been greatly altered. The difficulty in finding a doctor who will operate on me is the great secret behind the use of mind control telemetry and doctors' international solida rity with colleagues who use people for experiments. These tr ansmitters have changed my life in many ways and torment me th rough their constant use.\" In 1992 Naeslund contacted an activist organization , the International Network Against Mind Control, and par ticipated in drafting a letter protesting such experimentation t o British Prime Minister John Major. The day after the letter was sent, Naeslund believes that his apartment was again zapp ed: \"The first signs of radiation from electromagnetic weapons were noticed during the night of 11th October, the day after the letter was faxed worldwide. I was awakened at 3 a.m . by a blockage of the blood circulation in my hands, feet , forearms and parts of my legs, hands and feet swelled up and bec ame numb. My face and back became sunburned as if I had been sunbathing on a hot summer's day. This was to be repeated nigh t after night and it must be assumed that the electromagnet ic waves were ultraviolet in nature, a radiation which affec ts the skin's pigmentation and which are known to cause cancer. T he radiation continued during the following day and ni ght and even though I tried to be at home as little as possible, it became quite clear that they still had the power to vary the spe ctrum and intensity of the radiation which they were using ag ainst me. From the first day, I experienced noticeable change s in my lungs and windpipe which resembled the symptoms following the radiation of 1985. The windpipe and respiratory pas sages became parched, my voice hoarse, and my lungs painf ul. I also 134"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"suffered from acute amnesia whenever I crossed the threshold to my flat. By the third day, I considered it my sa fest move to leave my flat and so I went away for a week. \"On returning, I found myself in a radiation chambe r of considerably greater power than the one I had left in which it was possible to generate a multitude of destructive ly painful symptoms by varying the spectrum and intensity. I w as kept awake at nights and sent into a kind of trance duri ng the days, but by far the most frightening effect was that on the lungs which even after the first night had been severely impaired. When, after two days, I also began to suffer from b ackache and an almost crippling immobility, and when even the s hortest possible time in my flat began to be unbearable, I felt that it was time to desist risking my life and moved in with fr iends. Since I had to return occasionally to my flat, I was able t o establish that the radiation continued to penetrate my flat and on one fortunate occasion I was able to identify its sourc e. The deteriorating winter found me at home one evening t aking in some flowers from my balcony when I noticed in the block opposite, in the window of the flat directly under my own, was some apparatus, partially visible between the angle d slats of a Venetian blind. It was directed up at my flat. It w as emitting no light but its surface was lustrous. \"During the night I collected some infrared film an d some binoculars so that I could study it more closely. A s early as the previous summer, being more often out on the balcon y, I had noticed that there was never any light in that flat , just as there is none nowadays. The day after, I called on the flat at Verkstadsgatan 22 and rung the doorbell above the n ame Broman. No one answered, not surprisingly since I h eard from the neighbors that he had passed away some months b ack. The same day, I had the film developed; the picture I o btained revealed the apparatus with startling clarity. \"From here SAPO was terrorizing me and enfeebling m y health with their destructive radiation, and so tog ether with some friends I contrived to break into the flat and seize the apparatus. However, by 8 p.m. the same evening when I was home monitoring the situation, I noticed that the a pparatus was gone. They had been there and removed it and with i t the radiation. I was able to return home.\" Naeslund continues to be active in exposing covert mind control worldwide. [9] Another probable victim of mind control implants is Glen Nichols who in 1959 at the age of 12 was informed t hat he had a 135"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"hearing problem and needed to have a hearing aid. O bjections from friends and family prevented that from being d one until 1962, when he was implanted with a miniaturized rad io in his ear canal in the guise of receiving a hearing aid. \"Then they would use very low volume subliminal messages to co ntrol me,\" Nichols protests. \"They would give me post-hypnotic suggestions that I had ear infections and I must no t clean inside my ear canals or I would suffer permanent hearing l oss. Occasionally I would clean inside my ear canals and find a metal device that would be explained away by those around me.\" Nichols believes that he also experienced periods o f torture and mind erasure, and that in 1967 another Delgado- style electronic transceiver was implanted next to an ear drum. He was told that he had hurt his ear playing football. Nichols thinks that another implant was later inserted in his othe r ear, noting that he has several small scars above and behind bo th his ears. \"For some reason,\" Nichols states, \"in addition to the surgically implanted transceivers, at times additional miniatu re receivers were also inserted in my ear canals. I can recall h aving one found in my ear by a California State University, N orthridge, health center medical doctor in 1971. I also found another one in my ear about 1988.\" In another incident, \"I can recall having an electr ode inserted into my frontal brain through my nostril w hen I was about 33 in 1980. I experienced intense pain, confu sion and disequilibrium. I was told I had a sinus infection. I explored the source of my pain and found a small bulb stuck to t he roof of my nasal cavity. The doctors I contacted said it was a n infection and not to touch it. I persisted and removed it myself with tweezers. It looked like a two-pronged electrode, with two sh arp wires stuck up into my brain with the bulb hanging down.\" By 1989 Nichols, living in Westlake Village, Califo rnia, had completed his schooling and was a licensed counselo r and psychotherapist, working with a large number of pat ients from the defense industry. Nichols had come to the reali zation that he was a victim of mind control, with memories of c onditioning sessions and abuse returning to consciousness. Nichols suspected that he was also experiencing ele ctronic irradiation of some sort and obtained a radio frequ ency counter to check levels of emissions, which turned out to b e extremely high around his apartment building. Nichols has als o been vocal in decrying mind control experimentation, dissemina ting the account of his victimization over the Internet.

Afeworki had conducted a victorious war against Israeli-supplied Ethiopia. Certainly this would have been adequate reason for the brain tinkers to take note of him. In the summer of 1993, according to one of his counselors, \"he fell ill with a myste rious disease. Physicians called in from the U.S. said [Afeworki] had a rare 'brain fever' that could be treated only in a state -of-the-art Israeli clinic. Afeworki was rushed onto a military jet and flown to Israel. According to the same counselor, \"When he returned home a month later, he was a strangely changed man.\" Afewo rki's policies toward Ethiopia, and for that matter, Isra el changed into total cooperation. According to an Algerian delegate, \"We are told not to worry about this Eritrean flip-flop, but we do worry, and will worry more and more until we find out just what happened to President Afeworki in that Israeli neurology clinic where he became such a thoroughly changed man.\" [12] Another case is that of James Petit, who in 1984 cl aimed to 137"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"the press that he was a drug and arms smuggler for the CIA, with his employment by the Agency confirmed by his attorney and an attorney representing a co-defendant in a dr ug trafficking case.

His stay was confirmed by a spokesp erson for the hospital. Petit believes that while he was a pa tient there, that electronic implants were injected into his nec k, face, arms, and ears. \"After my release from the hospital,\" says Petit, \" I was having such extreme pain it was unbelievable.

It is impossible to know if the Times estimate is at all accurate, since it is unli kely that they would be privy to statistics of secret testing. Cer tainly, most anti-mind control activists would say that the figu re was a gross underestimate. NOTES: 1. Packard; \"Hess, Walter Rudolf, Encyclopedia America na.

Kennedy. Although a majori ty of Americans believe that the murder of Kennedy was pe rformed by a conspiracy, there are few who would suggest th at it was an act of pure mind control. The seminal research suggesting this interpretation of the assassination is that of \"William Torbitt,\" reporte d to have been the pseudonym for deceased Texas lawyer David Copel and. Copeland was a prosecuting attorney in the early 19 50s, later serving as a civil and criminal lawyer. He had been a close supporter of the Lyndon Johnson/Lloyd Bentsen polit ical steamroller in Texas until 1963, when he severed hi s ties with the group for reasons that will become apparent. In 1970 Copeland wrote Nomenclature of an Assassination Cab al circulated widely in photocopy, detailing informati on that he had gathered while investigating the murder of Pres ident John F. Kennedy. Nomenclature has only recently been bro ught out in paperback from Adventures Unlimited under the title NASA, Nazis & JFK, 27 years after the fact. While revealing much of the information relating to the thesis of the present chapter, Copeland was not aware of c ertain facts that I believe would have allowed him to see the br oader overall picture. According to Copeland, \"The killing of Pre sident Kennedy was planned and supervised by Division Five of the Federal Bureau of Investigation... Actually, Divisi on Five acted dually with the Defense Intelligence Agency which w as acting on behalf of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon .\" FBI Director and 33rd degree Freemason—the ranking Freemason in Washington, D.C. at the time—J. Edgar Hoover was according to Copeland, one of the conspirators. V ice President 139"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Lyndon Johnson was another. Not surprisingly, Willi am Sullivan, former assistant FBI director, has stated that Hoov er and Johnson \"mistrusted and disliked all three Kennedy brothers. President Johnson and Hoover had mutual fear and ha tred for the Kennedys.\" [1] According to Copeland, \"L.M. Bloomfield, a Montreal , Canada lawyer bearing the reputation as a sex deviate, the direct supervisor of all contractual agents with J. Edgar Hoover's Division Five, was the top coordinator for the netw ork planning the execution. A Swiss corporation, Permindex, was used to head five front organizations responsible for furni shing personnel and supervisors to carry out assigned dut ies.\" Almost buried within the Nomenclature text is infor mation that I consider among the most important revelation s. He reports that prior to the assassination, in 1963, t here was a top secret meeting at the Tryall Compound in Jamaica of Sir William Stephenson, Britain's top intelligence agent. At th e meeting was Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE), an element of British i ntelligence allegedly created to infiltrate American intelligen ce; Colonel Clay Shaw, formerly of the OSS; Ferenc Nagy, who had bee n a cabinet minister in the pro-Nazi Horthy government of Hunga ry, and later the prime minister of that country; Georgio M antello, a.k.a. George Mandel, former trade minister for Mussolini; and White Russian emigrees Jean de Menil and Paul Raigorodski . Shaw, Nagy, Montello, and Bloomfield were all officials o f Permindex. According to Copeland, the matter discussed at the meeting was the assassination of JFK. [2] The Kennedy family themselves were products of \"The Conspiracy.\" During Prohibition \"Papa Joe\" Kennedy worked with Newark, New Jersey's Reinfeld Syndicate, half of which was owned by the Bronfman bootlegging gang of Canad a. After the war, Kennedy was given a British distiller's li cense personally approved by Winston Churchill, with the Kennedy fortune administered by the the Lazard Brothers, Lt d., Rothschild affiliates and one of Europe's most infl uential families. As American ambassador to Great Britain, Kennedy attached himself to the pro-Nazi Cliveden set, wher e Round Tablers and Fabians congregated. Kathleen Kennedy, the sister of John, Edward, and Robert, married the Marquess o f Hartington, son and heir to the Duke of Devonshire, the head of worldwide Freemasonry, and of course prominent amon g the British ruling elite. Harold Macmillan, who became British prime minister during the John Kennedy presidency , was a 140"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"member of the Duke's family. While in Britain Joseph Kennedy was inducted into t he Most Venerable Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Joseph an d John Kennedy were trained in the Fabian-founded London S chool of Economics under the personal tutorage of Harold Las ki, a Fabian Society controller. John Kennedy apparently crossed the conspiracy, and died because of it. Robert Kennedy's much touted war on the Mafia was in fact mostly a personal vendetta against Jimm y Hoffa, and a targeting of lower level operatives. Men like Mey er Lansky remained untouched. But in a number of foolhardy mo ves Kennedy began to buck the directives of the British , winding down U.S. presence in Southeast Asia, opening up a dtente with the Soviet Union, and putting out feelers for secre t talks with Castro. Although Copeland, in Nomenclature, implicates a co mplex weave of conspirators, including members of the Maf ia, the fascist Solidarist movement, the FBI, NASA, and oth er groups, what he may have missed are what appear to me to be the highest levels of planning. Major Louis Mortimer Bl oomfield had been recruited into the SOE in 1938, and while unde r commission in that organization, had been assigned to the American OSS, then detailed into the counterespiona ge Division Five of the FBI. At the time of John Kennedy's assa ssination, Bloomfield was still an officer in Division Five. After the war, Bloomfield had resumed his career as an attorney in Montreal, Canada in the law firm of Phi llips, Vinefield, Bloomfield, and Goodman. He was attorney and controller for the Bronfman family fortune who in t hese latter days affected an air of propriety for those who did n't know their beginnings. The Bronfman family is the owner of Seagrams, the l argest liquor company in North America. During Prohibition the Bronfmans made their fortune in bootlegging, furnis hing the networks of men like Arthur Flegenheimer, a.k.a. Du tch Schultz, Arnold Rothstein, Meyer Lansky, Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Si egel, and Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano with their British-distille d product. After the repeal of Prohibition, the Bronfmans beca me street- legal, with members of the family being elected int o the highest levels of the Most Venerable Order of St. John of J erusalem and intermarrying with the Rothschilds. [3] Bloomfield was also a high-ranking official in the United Nations, providing legal advice to that august body . He found his way into that position by being a representative of the Round 141"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Table-established International Executive Board of UK- International Law Association, an offshoot formed i n 1873 and charged with developing a one-world code of law. Bl oomfield was also a high-ranking member of the Most Venerabl e Order of St. John of Jerusalem, and the annual chairman of t he Histadrut campaign in Canada, that owns over one-third of the Gross National Product of Israel. Among his many position s, Bloomfield took on the role of consul-general in ch arge of the Western Hemisphere and Liberia, one of the largest centers in the world for the transfer of black market monies. By 1958 Bloomfield had established Permindex, incor porated in Switzerland and purporting to be a trade exposit ion company, but in fact an international assassination bureau o f the Special Operations Executive. All of the participants in th e Kennedy plot at the Tryall Compound were officials and inve stors in Permindex. One of the chief operatives of Permindex was Colone l Clay Shaw of the OSS. Shaw, like Bloomfield, was a homos exual—this mentioned to make the connection to the long term h omosexual orientation of many premier operatives at the highe st level of the conspiracy. Shaw himself has testified that he was the OSS liaison officer to the headquarters of British Prim e Minister Winston Churchill. Shaw returned to the U.S. after the war and took over the directorship of the International Hou se/World Trade Center, leaving it to found the International Trade Market in New Orleans. Later, Shaw would become a director of Permindex, and the ITM would become a subsidiary of Centro Mondiale Commerciale, an arm of that assassination bureau. In all probability, all of these companies were fronts for the Special Operations Executive, that had long adhered to a po licy of working through commercial fronts. At the time of this writing, there are over 50 Worl d Trade Centers around the world, run from the World Trade Center Association of Clay Shaw, and connected by computer and satellite. On March 16, 1967, Perry Raymond Russo testified be fore a criminal district court panel in New Orleans, that he had been present during a conversation between Claw Shaw, Da vid Ferrie, and a person calling himself \"Leon Oswald.\" Ferrie, an agent of Division Five, talked about the necessity of three shooters and a \"triangulation of fire,\" and that a scapegoat could be used to enable the actual assassins to escape. According to Copeland, in Nomenclature of an Assassination Cabal the person g oing by the name \"Leon Oswald\" was in fact William Seymour, an agent for a 142"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"private detective agency called Double-Chek, report edly used as a cut-out for Division Five and CIA operations. According to Nomenclature, seven riflemen were used to shoot Kennedy, a Mexico-based assassination squad w hose Oaxaca-based organization had been put together in 1943 by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and SOE Commander Sir Will iam Stephenson. Copeland seems to have intuited that there was a programming behind the assassination, although not apparently making the connect of who was responsible. He said, \"It should be pointed out that during a few years following Jo hn Kennedy's murder, the crime rate in the United States more th an doubled. Public opinion surveys during the time reflected ab out 80% of the people did not believe the Warren Commission re port. The general public felt someone or some group had been behind the murder of John F. Kennedy and the guilty ones had n ot been punished. Such an attitude on the part of the publi c leads to a gradual breakdown of law, order and morals of socie ty.\" What Copeland did not see was that that breakdown w as engineered by the very forces responsible for the m ind control of America and the destruction of its way of life. The Kennedy assassination was a British intelligence—read Tavis tock—hit, and its purpose was to shock the American consciousness into a near-comatose state for reprogramming, the standard Tavistock modus operandi. Specific techniques of mind control may have also b een employed in the Kennedy assassination at the microc osmic level. Lee Harvey Oswald in September, 1957, arrived at th e Atsugi Naval Air Base to work as a radar operator with a s ecurity clearance, odd for a man so forthcoming about his p ro- Communist views that he was dubbed \"Oswaldovitch\" b y his fellow soldiers. Atsugi, aside from being the launc h base for the top secret U-2 spy plane, also housed the Joint Tec hnical Advisory Group, where MKULTRA LSD experimentation i s said to have taken place. [4] Once in Atsugi, Oswald engaged in more than radar monitoring. At a Tokyo nightclub called the Queen B ee, Oswald became intimate with a hostess who was believed to be a Russian spy, and contracted gonorrhea. Oswald's medical rec ord states that the disease was contracted \"in line of duty, n ot due to own misconduct.\" Obviously, Oswald was at the time func tioning as an agent of the military, probably performing surve illance on the believed Russian spy at the Queen Bee. [5] Kerry Thornley, perhaps Oswald's closest friend at the Atsugi 143"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"base, in correspondence with the author recalls an attempt to recruit himself, Oswald, and a third man into a pos sible intelligence operation. Thornley writes, \"In the late 1970s I was contacted by David Bucknel l, who said he was in Marine Air Control Squadron Nine wit h Oswald and me. When he mentioned that his nickname was 'Bu cky Beaver,' I recalled Bucknell—a large man with buck teeth who wore his utility cap all the way down on his head, giving it a dome shape instead of the common stretched, flat-to p shape. \"Bucknell asked me if I remembered an attempt to re cruit us (Bucknell, Oswald, me) to military intelligence. I did not. Then he asked if I remembered approaching he and Oswald one day and being told by Oswald that 'This is a private co nversation.' That I recalled clearly. Bucknell said it happened as we were on our way to the recruitment lecture. \"Indeed, I remembered the incident occurred as all three of us were walking in the same direction toward 'Mains ide' on the base and away from the radar outpost. Bucknell said that minutes earlier, on the outpost, the names of Oswal d, Bucknell and Thornley had been called over the P.A. system a nd that we were told to report to the squadron office. In the squadron office, we were ordered to report to base security over at 'Mainside' of L.T.A., the satellite of El Toro Mari ne Base where we were stationed. \"Bucknell said he and Oswald were running a loan sh arking operation and their private conversation concerned whether or not they were now being called in for questioning a bout that. Oswald doubted it, because I had been called up at the same time and knew nothing about the operation. \"Bucknell says when we arrived at base security we were seated in a small auditorium or lecture room with a number of men from other outfits. Up in front, according to B ucknell, was a Marine captain and a Hispanic man in civilian clo thes with a flat-top haircut. Bucknell was surprised to see tha t the Captain was acting as an 'errand boy' for this civilian, wh om the Captain finally introduced as 'Mister B.' \"'Mister B.' said, 'We have reason to believe that Castro's new revolutionary government has been infiltrated by So viet agents.' (This would have been in late May or early June of 1959, just after the New Year's Day Revolution, before Castro 'went Communist.' I recalled someone making that statemen t in a lecture I attended, but did not remember the contex t). \"We had all been called together, said Mr. B., beca use we were reputed to be admirers of Fidel Castro. As I u nderstand it, 144"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"and dimly recall it, the pitch was that Castro need ed our help in getting rid of these agents. We were being asked to volunteer for a counter-espionage program! \"I'm sure I would have volunteered. To the best of my recollection, I was ostensibly turned down because I was already slated for a tour of duty in the Far East, to begin in June, and the training program was in the U.S.—But not before I s igned some papers authorizing using me for intelligence purpos es. \"Bucknell made detailed notes of this extraordinary event the day after it occurred, and when we met in San Franc isco in the late 1970s he read me those notes. \"Volunteers were interviewed on a one-on-one basis after the recruitment lecture. Bucknell says he had a materna l grandfather named E.H. Hunt, who he listed on the r ecruitment form as a reference. Mister B. looked startled and said, 'Who is this E.H. Hunt?' Bucknell explained. Mister B. said , 'Oh!,' and laughed. (E. Howard Hunt was second in command unde r Nixon on the Bay of Pigs operation.) \"Bucknell was never contacted again in relation to this program. Neither was I. \"Bucknell says that the Marine Air Control Squadron 's covert security was handled by Army Intelligence, and we n ow both suspect that Oswald may already have been an Army I ntelligence agent pretending to be a Marxist at the time of Mr. B.'s recruitment attempt, which may have enhanced his qualifications for Mr. B.'s program. \"At about the time all this happened, I began havin g vivid audio hallucinations, usually just before falling a sleep.\" [6] Two weeks prior to Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, Robert E. Webster, formerly with the Navy, renounce d his American citizenship. Like Oswald, Webster would la ter do a turnabout and return to the United States—his retur n greased by \"affidavits from Rand.\" Webster had been at a trade exhibition in Moscow wi th the Rand Development Corporation. When Webster renounce d his citizenship, he was accompanied by two Rand executi ves, Henry Rand and George Bookbinder, both of whom had been w ith the OSS. The Rand Corporation had been involved with Am erican mind control research since at least 1949, when it issued a report on Soviet hypnosis experiments and proposed an American counter-offensive. Although there is no direct evidence linking Webste r or Oswald, who inquired about Webster at the time of h is own return to the U.S., to Rand mind control experiment s, it is plain 145"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"that if Oswald and Webster had been American spies pretending to defect, then they probably would have received h ypnotic programming to counter the inevitable interrogation in Moscow. It is also fascinating to learn that the address of Webster's apartment building was in Marina Oswald's address b ook, and that she is known to have said that her husband def ected after employment at an American exhibition that took plac e in Moscow. This was obviously not Oswald, but Webster . [7] The pseudonymous \"Lincoln Lawrence,\" in Were We Controlled, recalls a \"deadly rumor\" that Lee Harve y Oswald had been admitted to the Third Clinical Hospital's Ear, Nose, and Throat division in Minsk, Russia. Lawrence says tha t after Oswald was anaesthetized, a tiny radio receiver was implanted in Oswald's head that could trigger at will post-hypno tic suggestions that had already been induced. The same device could be used to erase his memory of events. Whether or not Oswald was implanted, the \"deadly ru mor\" seems to have reached the ears of CIA Director McCo ne, who penned a memo to Secret Service head James Rowley o n March 3, 1964. McCone's memo stated that Oswald had possi bly been \"chemically or electronically 'controlled'... a sle eper agent. Subject spent 11 days hospitalized for a 'minor ail ment' which should have required no more than three days hospit alization at best.\" [8] One person who reacted with shock about Lincoln Law rence's allegation that Oswald had been implanted with a co ntrol device was Marguerite Oswald, Lee's mother. She told Dalla s assassination researcher Mary Ferrel, \"I've got to find out who wrote this book, because he knew my son.\" Marguerit e Oswald would not explain to Ferrell how she knew this, but Dick Russell, author of The Man Who Knew Too Much, specu lates, \"Marguerite would sometimes stand behind Lee's chai r as he played some board game and rub his back and head. A nd she said the texture of his hair had changed, it wasn't soft like it used to be. Suddenly it came to me: What if, when s he was doing that, she felt a little scar up inside the ha irline.\" Another person concerned about Oswald's appearance was his brother Robert. According to Epstein, in Legend , \"The most marked change was his hair. Not only had it thinned almost to the point of baldness on top, but the texture had c hanged from soft to kinky.

[10] One of CIA pilot and hypnotist David Ferrie's assoc iates, in Bowart's Operation Mind Control, is quoted as havin g suggested that Oswald had been hypnotized by Ferrie to murder the president. Ferrie was a CIA contract agent and the high priest of a small religious group called the Apostolic Old Catholic Church of North America that, according to research er Loren Coleman, engaged in animal sacrifice and the drinki ng of blood. Coleman states, \"During Lee Harvey Oswald's last we eks in New Orleans, he attended many ritualistic parties in pr ivate homes and apartments with David Ferrie.\" [11] If hypnotism was used to program Oswald, hypnotism may have been employed for his ultimate \"deprogramming\" through death by another assassin. On the scene immediately prior to the John F. Kennedy assassination was William Crowe , whose stage name was Bill DeMar. Crowe was employed as a stage hypnotist at Jack Ruby's Carousel Club on the week of the assassination. Jack Ruby, of course, was the man wh o shot Lee Harvey Oswald. [12] Another mind-controlled assassin may have participa ted in the Kennedy hit. In 1967 the Phillipine National Bu reau of Investigation (NBI) arrested 24-year-old Luis Angel Castillo on suspicion of planning to assassinate President Ferd inand Marcos in league with a group of Philippine guerrillas. Ca stillo's passport identified him as Antonio Reyes Eloriaga, a Philippine resident returning after expulsion from America for car theft and exceeding the time limit on his visa. The Manil a Times reported that, while in America, Castillo had used at least five aliases. At his request, Castillo was given truth serum and hypnotized. The hypnotist reported, \"Initially, the subject ind icated an admixture of desired susceptibility to hypnosynthes is but deep- seated resistance due to the presence of a posthypn otic block. This block appeared to have been connected with the presence—nightmarish—of a Mrs. Kreps.

Although he had little memory of his childhood, his later life had apparently been as an hypnotically-programmed opera tive for the Special Operations Group of the CIA. Castillo revealed to the NBI that he had been conta cted for training in espionage when he was a private in the Cuban militia, and received his initial training from Americans an d Cubans near the Bay of Pigs. Castillo also revealed that he had been programmed for another assassination, this one involving a man rid ing in an open car in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. According to Castillo, the earlier-mentioned Mrs. K reps, who had a German accent, was one of several persons who hypnotically programmed him in Dallas. He also reco gnized the names of several persons at the time being investig ated for the assassination of John Kennedy by District Attorney Jim Garrison, and was able to provide a detailed account of his p articipation in the plot.

Kennedy. Shortly before the murder of Kennedy, Sirhan Sirhan was seen in the Ambassador Hotel \"sta ring fixedly\" at the teletype machine. According to the teletype operator, \"he came over to my machine and started s taring at it. Just staring. I'll never forget his eyes. I asked h im what he wanted. He didn't answer. He just kept staring. I a sked him again. No answer. I said that if he wanted the late st figures on Senator Kennedy, he'd have to check the other machi ne. He still didn't answer. He just kept staring.\" One eyewitness said that Sirhan was \"enormously com posed\" during the commission of the crime. Reminding one o f the stories of madmen exhibiting tremendous strength, a nother witness said that when people were attempting to su bdue Sirhan during the shooting, \"the little man's strength was fantastic.\" After Sirhan was taken into custody, LAPD officers found out that he had the interesting ability to tell time—to the minute—without a clock. Again, this is reminiscent of the extended senses of the hypnotized or otherwise mind controlled subject. [1] For his own part, Sirhan said that he did the shoot ing \"without trying,\" and described his condition as be ing that of a \"puppet.\" Sirhan has stated on several occasions th at there are many aspects of the case that have not been reveale d. He also has wondered whether he was mind controlled, sugges ting one witness to the assassination in particular, who he thought could \"Maybe... lead to someone who was playing with my m ind.\" When questioned by the public defender assigned to him in the case, Sirhan said, \"I don't remember much about the shooting, sir, did I do it? Well, yes, I am told I did it. I remember being at the Ambassador [Hotel]. I am drin king Tom Collinses. I got dizzy. I went back to my car so I could go home. But I was too drunk to drive.

After he had returned home, it was noted that he had become fascinated by the occult. [3] And then there is the question of accomplices. Secu rity guard Thane Cesar, in close proximity to Kennedy du ring the shooting, is believed by many researchers to have p articipated in the assassination. Cesar informed Ted Charach, co-p roducer of the movie The Second Gun, that he had attended \"Ame rican- Nazi conclaves.\" Cesar was also employed at the CIA -connected Lockheed, and one retired engineer from the company said that Cesar worked in an area of the company run by the C IA. Immediately after the Kennedy shooting a woman name d Sandra Serrano saw a Caucasian woman in a white dre ss with black polka dots, and a young man, tentatively iden tified as Mexican-American, and wearing a white shirt and gol d sweater, running down the stairs that provided exit from the hotel. The woman in the polka dots said, \"We've shot him! We'v e shot him.\" Serrano asked, \"Who did you shoot?\", and the woman responded, \"We shot Senator Kennedy.\" Thomas Vincent DiPierro, the son of one of the mait re d's who was working at the Ambassador, said that he had seen Sirhan immediately before the shooting and that he had been in the company of a woman in a polka dot dress. A third witness also saw Sirhan, an half hour befor e the murder of Kennedy, with a woman in a polka dot dres s and a tall, thin man with dark hair. After Kennedy was sh ot, the witness saw the woman and the tall man running from the scene of the crime. Another witness saw Sirhan on June 3, after a visit to the Ambassador Hotel, in the company of a woman and two other men. Another witness said that she had seen a man who lo oked like Sirhan on June 3. The man was in a blue 1959 F ord. The car pulled to the curb and the Sirhan look-alike ju mped out and began arguing with two other men in the front seat. The man's jacket flew open and the witness saw a gun in his w aistband. Although the witness could not identify who was tal king, she heard the words \"Kennedy,\" and \"Get in the car, we have to get him tonight,\" as well as \"Don't want to,\" and \"Afra id.\" One of the busboys at the Ambassador told police ab out two men who had come to the hotel on the day before the shooting, attempting to obtain coats like those worn by the w aiters, while 152"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"a waitress in nearby Alhambra, California said that on the morning of June 4 she had seen a man she took to be Sirhan drawing a map—some kind of floor plan. Reminding one of Lee Harvey Oswald's gun practice, in which he made himself conspicuous, Sirhan practiced shoot ing at a target range on June 4, where he signed in with his name and address. This in itself was odd, because the rangem aster did not usually monitor whether the shooters signed in or n ot. The rangemaster remembered that shortly after Sirhan ha d arrived, an attractive blonde in the company of a man had al so arrived. Sirhan walked over to them and said, \"Let me show y ou how to shoot.\" The woman's response was, \"Get away from me , goddamnit, someone will recognize us.\" [4] Sirhan was recognized buying bullets for the .22 ca liber handgun he allegedly used to murder Kennedy. In his company, according to the clerk at the gunstore, were Sirhan 's brother Munir and another man he was unable to identify. A young man named Crispin Curiel Gonzalez was arres ted in Juarez, Mexico, carrying notes showing that he knew Sirhan and that Sirhan had planned to murder Kennedy. Gonzalez was later found hanging in his cell in Juarez. Questioned abo ut the incident by author Robert Blair Kaiser, Sirhan resp onded, \"That kid didn't have to die. He didn't do anything.\" Kaiser asked Sirhan, \"Who would have wanted to get him out of the way?\" According to Kaiser, \"Sirhan paused reflectively fo r a moment, then smiled. Then he changed the subject. \" After the murder of Kennedy, police searched Sirhan 's room and found a large amount of Rosicrucian (in this ca se AMORC, not the historical Rosicrucians) and other occult r eading material. Sirhan is alleged to have also been acqua inted with a member of The Process group, a Scientology offshoot , and to have attended parties at the home of Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate, who also may have been linked to The P rocess. Robert F. Kennedy dined at the Polanski mansion the day before he was assassinated. [5] Sirhan left behind several notebooks filled with jo ttings indicating his strange state of mind prior to the s hooting. A transcript of one page follows: \"May 18, 9:45 a.m. -68.

One of the originators of the PSE, Charles McQuiston, described by Walter Bowart as a \"former high- ranking U.S. Intelligence Officer,\" stated that, \"I 'm convinced that Sirhan wasn't aware of what he was doing. He w as in a hypnotic trance when he pulled the trigger and kill ed Senator Kennedy... Everything in the PSE charts tells me th at someone else was involved in the assassination—and that Sir han was programmed through hypnosis to kill RFK. What we ha ve here is a real live 'Manchurian Candidate.'\" [6] Dr. John W. Heisse, Jr., president of the Internati onal Society of Stress Analysis, concurred with that appraisal: \"Sirhan kept repeating certain phrases. This clearly revealed he had been programmed to put himself into a trance. This is so mething he couldn't have learned by himself. Someone had to sh ow him and teach him how. I believe Sirhan was brainwashed und er hypnosis by the constant repetition of words like ' You are nobody. You're nothing. The American dream is gone' until he actually believed them. At that stage someone impla nted an idea, 'Kill RFK,' and under hypnosis the brainwashe d Sirhan accepted it.\" Another expert, Dr. Herbert Spiegel, a medical hypn otist, agreed: \"It's very possible to distort and change s omebody's mind through a number of hypnotic sessions. It can be described as brainwashing because the mind is clear ed of its old emotions and values which are replaced by implantin g other suggestions... This technique was probably used wit h Sirhan.

W ielding a Charter Undercover .38 Special, Chapman fired five hollow point fragmenting bullets into Lennon's back as he walked into The Dakota apartment block in New York city. There is much evidence to suggest that American intelligence agencies considered Lennon a menace, a nd this could have well provided a reason for his murder. J ohn Lennon attracted the attention of the FBI for the first ti me in January 1969, when a Special Agent in Charge reported to J. Edgar Hoover on a demonstration in New Haven, Connecticut . The demonstration had been spurred by the suspension of the campus newspaper for the publication of nude photos of John and Yoko—reprints of the front and back covers of t he \"Two Virgins\" record album, at that time available in re cord stores throughout the country. In the years that followed, during Lennon's many sh ots at political activism, the FBI's file on the rock star -cum-culture hero would grow to at least 288 pages, although ent ire years of reports of surveillance on Lennon have never been r eleased. By 1972 the CIA was in on the act. Lennon had been very vocal in his disapproval of the war in Vietnam, and was seen as one of the most effective forces capable of rallyin g American youth in large-scale opposition to the war. On the 23rd of February of that year, a CIA agent filed the follow ing report: \"Some American participants at the Soviet-controlle d World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina, held 11-13 February 1972 in Paris/Versai lles, attempted unsuccessfully to include a call for inte rnational demonstrations to take place at the time of the Rep ublican National Convention... 157"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"\"John LENNON, a British subject, has provided finan cial support to Project 'YES' [an organization started b y Yoko], which in turn paid the travel expenses to the World Assem bly of a representative of leading anti-war activist (and Ch icago Seven defendant) Rennie DAVIS... In Paris this representa tive in the World Assembly met at least once with officials of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam; it is no t known if the Republican Convention was discussed.\" Lennon believed, and with good reason, that by 1972 he was under constant surveillance. In late 1972, Lennon t old Paul Krassner, \"Listen, if anything happens to Yoko and me, it was not an accident.\" Facing deportation from the U.S. ostensibly due to a marijuana conviction in Great Britain, Lennon fough t back, claiming the deportation was really due to his poli tics and disapproval of the war in Vietnam. On 21 April, 1972, E.L. Shackleford, a supervisor i n the New York FBI office, sent a memo to one of his agents, one only partially available to us due to large blacked-out segments: \"In view of successful delaying tactics to date, th ere exists real possibility that subject [John Lennon] will no t be deported from US in near future and possibly not prior to Re publican National Convention. Subject's activities being clo sely followed and any information developed indicating violation of Federal laws will be immediately furnished to pertinent age ncies in effort to neutralize any disruptive activities of s ubject.\" As of May, 1972, Lennon had gotten the message, app arently from Leon Wilde, his immigration lawyer, that if he didn't want to be deported from the U.S., nor to jeopardize his position in his attempt to gain custody of Yoko's daughter Kyok o, that he would have to maintain a lower political profile. L ennon bowed to the pressure. In that month he went on the Dick Cavett television show and announced that he was canceling a planned \"revolutionary road show\" and pulling back in terms of political involvement. Lennon was reportedly \"sick at heart\" over the decision he was forced to make. According to political activist John Sinclair, abou t whom Lennon wrote a song, \"Cancelling the tour plan was wise. I know how much it meant for them to stay here—partia lly because of the thing with the kid. I understood p erfectly.\" In September of 1973 the U.S. Department of Justice admitted that Lennon's phone had been illegally tap ped.

After a lengthy retirement from the public eye, by 1980 Lennon seemed to be doing a turnabout. He had a new record album out, and was interested in returning to promi nence, as well as getting back into political activism. Lenno n had already bought the plane tickets to fly to San Francisco to support striking Japanese American workers. Lennon may have been seen as the only man in the world capable of re-ign iting the militancy of the 60s. [1] Lennon would soon encounter the penultimate nebbish with a gun: Mark David Chapman. Chapman was from Georgia, and began working for the YMCA in 1969, first as a full -time camp counselor and then as an assistant camp director. I n CIA defector Philip Agee's book Inside the Company: CIA Diary, he indicates the YMCA as a CIA front organization. Cur iously, Chapman's employment record is missing from the headquarters of the organization. In 1971 Chapman had a religious conversion to Chris tianity. In 1975 he travelled to Beirut in the employ of the YMCA in their International Camp Counselor Program—his firs t choice being the Soviet Union, even though he was a veheme nt anti- communist. Chapman's visit to Beirut coincided with the period of time that Edwin Wilson and Frank Terpil were run ning a training school for assassins there. [2] Returning from Beirut, he worked at a YMCA camp for Vietnamese refugees in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. Chap man worked as an Area Coordinator, in charge of a seven -block area of the camp, with one American and fifteen Vietname se assistants. One of the enigmas of Chapman's life is his longtime friend, known by the pseudonym \"Gene Scott\" in Fent on Bresler's account, who visited Chapman while workin g at Fort Chaffee. One of Chapman's co-workers told journalist Craig U nger, \"As soon as Gene arrived, Mark's behavior changed. Mark cleaned his nails for Gene, he put on his clean clothes for Gene, he made telephone calls for Gene. And there was Gene's gun. Mark was so non-violent. He hated guns. I still remember the m sitting in the office of the YMCA center at Fort Chaffee, play ing with this gun, looking at it, talking about it. It just wasn' t like Mark. They started rough-housing, then Gene gave Mark thi s look. He froze.\" In his account of Chapman, Fenton Bresler writes th at, \"several people to whom I have spoken in Decatur an d elsewhere believe that the two men, who have known each other 159"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"since Columbia High School days, have complex under tones to their apparently still-continuing friendship. Certa inly Mark idolized Gene, older by a few years and a handsome Rambo-like character who has never married: he is today a Geor gia sheriff's officer.\" According to Bresler, \"he was the man who gave Mark the hollow-point bullets, not knowing (as he said) that he would use them to shoot John Lennon.\" In 1976 Chapman reportedly ended his job with the Y MCA, and took a job as a security guard at the insistenc e of \"Gene Scott.\" Chapman moved to Hawaii in 1977, and stayed in the YMCA hostel in Honolulu. Chapman also contacted the suicide hotline there, and went to the Waikiki Mental Healt h Clinic. Hawaii has been noted as the location of a mind con trol assassination training center in the account of sev eral intelligence agency defectors. In 1978 Chapman travelled around the world with a l etter of introduction as a YMCA staff member, staying in YMC A hostels, the trip reportedly financed by a loan from the cre dit union of a hospital he worked at. This loan, to a relatively n ew employee, seems suspicious and follows in the tradition of ma ny other \"lone nut assassins\" who, while non-employed or und er- employed never lack for travel expenses. Chapman returned to Hawaii. He was married in 1979 and shortly after, one in a string of obsessions, becam e fixated on the book Catcher in the Rye, identifying with the book' s protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Some researchers have suggested t hat the book may have been used as a \"trigger\" for a progra mmed Chapman, although this is only speculation. In Hono lulu Chapman purchased the gun that he would use to kill Lennon. Travelling to New York, Chapman checked into the Wa ldorf- Astoria, then after a few days moved into a YMCA ho stel. Chapman found that he could not buy bullets legally in New York. He travelled to Atlanta, where hollow points were f urnished by his friend \"Gene Scott\" at Chapman's insistence tha t he needed to protect himself in the Big Apple. Chapman return ed to New York only to be told by the doorman at The Dakota t hat Lennon and his wife were out of town. Chapman flew back to Hawaii, throwing away his copy of Catcher in the Rye. In Hawaii, according to a psychiatrist, Chapman was receiving \"command hallucinations\" telling him to kill John L ennon. These could have been hypnotically programmed, or e ven broadcast electronically. Chapman called a differen t mental health clinic than the one he had dealt with before , and was turned away with a referral to still another clinic . Chapman's 160"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"own account of the period describes an interior str uggle lasting several months, \"a struggle between good and evil a nd right and wrong. I just gave in. It was almost as if I was on some kind of special mission that I could not avoid.\" A few weeks after his return from the mainland, Cha pman returned to the States, again seemingly having mone y to burn. During his trips to the mainland Chapman carried la rge amounts of cash, although there has never been a satisfacto ry explanation of how he came by the money. Chapman did not immediately fly to New York, but st opped off in Chicago for three days that are not accounte d for. His plane ticket, according to Fenton Bresler, was late r doctored to show that Chapman had flown non-stop to New York. T his fact is substantiated by photocopies of two versions of the same ticket, one for Chicago, the other indicating a dir ect passage to New York. Who falsified the ticket remains an open question, but the existence of two versions of the ticket is compelling evidence for a conspiracy in the murder. When Chapman did reach New York he went to the YMCA hostel located nearest to The Dakota. After checkin g at the hotel to find out that the Lennons were not in and that no one knew when to expect them back, Chapman that evening took a cab to west 62nd Street, where he went inside an ap artment building for five minutes, and then to East 65th St reet and 2nd Avenue, where he went into another apartment buildi ng for a few minutes. These visits have never been explained . Chapman was then dropped off in Greenwich Village. Chapman was carrying a satchel that has not been accounted for. The next morning Chapman checked out of the YMCA ho stel and booked himself into the more expensive Sheraton Center Hotel. In his hotel room he made a \"shrine\" on top of a bureau, with mementos of his life—a Bible, his expired pass port, a Todd Rundgren audio tape, and other items—as well as a p hoto from the Wizard of Oz with Judy Garland. Chapman hung around outside The Dakota for a full d ay without seeing Lennon, then returned the following day. As a gesture, he bought another copy of Catcher in the R ye and inscribed it \"To Holden Caulfield from Holden Caulf ield. This is my statement.\" When Lennon and his wife emerged fro m The Dakota around 5 p.m., Chapman got the star's autogr aph. The couple returned at 10:50 p.m. As Lennon walked towa rd the apartment building a reportedly \"smirking\" Chapman fired five bullets into his back. Then Chapman threw down his gun and began to read the paperback he had carried. 161"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Chapman described the murder in this fashion: \"If you ever get the chance, go to The Dakota build ing.

I pulled the gun out of my pocket, I handed over to m y left hand, I don't remember aiming. I must have done, but I don' t remember drawing the bead or whatever you call it. And I just pulled the trigger steady five times.\" One of the police officers who interrogated Chapman , Lieutenant Arthur O'Connor, described the apparent state of mind of the murderer: \"I saw him within half an hou r of his arrest. I was the first one to interrogate him. He was in a daze. He was composed yet not there. He gave me the impre ssion he had done something: it was something he had to do a nd he'd done it.\" Later O'Connor said, \"It's possible Mark could have been used by somebody. I saw him the night of the murder. I s tudied him intensely. He looked as if he could have been progr ammed... That was the way he looked and that was the way he talked. It could have been drugs—and no, we did not test for d rugs! It was not standard procedure. But looking back, he could have been either drugged or programmed—or a combination of bo th.\" According to newspaper reports at the time, Chapman had in his possession at the time of the murder a cassette player and tapes with \"about fourteen hours of Beatles tapes.\" Except that according to the arresting officer, Steve Spiro, Ch apman did not have a cassette player or tapes on him when arreste d. Either the cassette player was invented by an imaginative reporter, or it vanished—and if it vanished, might it have had some thing recorded other than Beatles' music? After shooting Lennon, Chapman was in a \"daze\" for days. Chapman pleaded guilty to the murder in court after hearing \"the voice of God\" telling him to do so. Dr. Doroth y Lewis, who examined Chapman, said that \"Mr. Chapman had been experiencing auditory hallucinations while at the h ospital unit at Rikers Island and these experiences clearly influen ced his decision to plead guilty...

Ac cording to the Los Angeles Times, \"The investigators said authorit ies theorize that [McVeigh's companion] John Doe 2 could be two people, and that McVeigh and his alleged conspirators could have used different men to accompany him in order to serve as 'decoys' and confuse investigators trying to trace his movem ents.\" [2] The New York Times noted, \"Mr. McVeigh lived in the Kingman [Arizona] area for a year until he was evic ted from a trailer park last June. The owner of the trailer park said Mr. 165"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"McVeigh had lived there from February to June 1994. Residents of the Canyon West Mobile Park drew a picture of an arrogant loner who worked as a security guard for a now-defu nct trucking company, lived with his pregnant girlfriend, expres sed deep anger against the federal government and often caus ed trouble for his neighbors.\" Not in the headlines but only relegated to a tiny b lurb on a back page of a few papers was the news that the own er of the trailer park later changed his mind. He said that t he man had not been Timothy McVeigh after all. \"They were the same height, the same age, they looked alike,\" he stated , also mentioning that both men had recently been released from the army. [3] McVeigh complained that while in the army he had be en implanted with a microchip in his buttocks. One acq uaintance said that McVeigh believed he was being mind-contro lled through the chip. After McVeigh was arrested, one o f the few things that he complained about was the discomfort the chip was causing him. After leaving the military, McVeigh soon had ajob w ith Burns International Security Services, dispatched to the Calspan organization in Buffalo, New York. Calspan is engag ed in a number of top secret projects, working in areas suc h as aeronautics, electronic warfare, microwave technolo gy, and electronic telemetry. Monitoring by microchip is, b y definition, electronic telemetry. Additional possible substantiation of mind control comes from McVeigh's army acquaintance Todd A. Regier, wh o said he was \"kind of cold. He wasn't enemies with anyone. H e was kind of almost like a robot. He never had a date when I knew him in the army. I never saw him at a club. I never saw hi m drinking. He never had good friends. He was a robot. Everythi ng was for a purpose.\" [4] Walter \"Mac\" McCarty, a gun instructor who believed that McVeigh and Fortier were trying to involve him in a plot in Kingman, Arizona, also has strange things to say ab out the mindset of the men who allegedly did the Oklahoma C ity bombing: \"He [McVeigh] was upset about things happe ning in this country to the point of being disoriented... I know brainwashing when I see it, those boys had really g otten a good case of it.\" [5] Is it possible that like Lee Harvey Oswald, as many researchers believe, McVeigh left the army for the purpose of being recruited into a more secret military unit engaged in 166"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"domestic work—particularly for the infiltration of the right-wing patriot underground? This is substantiated by a let ter that Timothy McVeigh sent to his sister Jennifer, claimi ng that he had been working in a military Special Forces group involved in criminal activity.

A common thread links many of these cases: their belief that they are mind-controlled. —The San Francisco Chronicle for March 17, 1984, fe atured a story titled \"Incident near White House: Gunman's b izarre claims,\" detailing the arrest of a man near the Whi te House who claimed that he had been injected with a \"crystalli ne implant\" that broadcast messages telling him to kill the pre sident. A far- fetched claim, until one remembers that the technol ogy for such implants does exist, and has apparently been in use for decades. [1] —Another case with a familiar ring to it is that of Emmanuel Tsegaye, a 33-year-old bank teller in Bethesda, Mar yland, described as \"rarely violent to others,\" who killed three fellow- employees at the Chevy Chase Federal Savings Bank. In the past he had been placed in psychiatric facilities, and h ad received undefined treatments at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a facility infamous for CIA experimentation. Tsegaya said, in a letter to the judge who committed him, \"I used to hear... voi ces both from space and as... exact repeated words... I used to hear a person speaking from [the] distance about the thing s I was speaking.\" Describing his state of mind after an at tempted suicide, Tsegaye wrote, \"I was depressed, mentally and physically weak... from the voices I used to hear a nd inadequate sleeps.\" [2] —On May 5, 1991, Carl Campbell went to a bus stop i n the parking lot of the Pentagon, and fired five gunshot s into the chest and abdomen of Navy Commander Edward J.

In 1986 he is reported to have been one of two men who physically beat newsman Dan Rather, asking him repeatedly, \"Ke nneth, what's the frequency?\" Tager—and his accomplice—app arently believed that Rather knew the electronic frequency of his believed mind control bombardment.

[6] —The case of Robert Joe Moody is an unusual one in the annals of mind controlled murder. Moody was arreste d for the murder of Michelle Malone, age 36, and Pat Magda, 5 6. Moody had been part of a sexual threesome with Malone and his girlfriend, Dora Lee, while Magda was his next-door neighbor, as well as being the wife of an Air Force officer. Moody claimed, even before his arrest, that he was commanded by extraterrestrial aliens, or rather, wh at he calls \"Extrasensory Biological Entities\", to murder the t wo women so that he would accomplish his \"ultimate mission,\" to be lethally injected and be resurrected by the alien entities. In an attempt to explain why he was representing himself in court in October 1995, Moody said, \"I have never denied my participa tion in that... [but] it wasn't voluntary... I had no consc ious control of what was going on.\" Mind control researcher Walter Bowart, who has wr itten 170"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"about the Moody case, believes that even though the man has been found competent to stand trial he is a Multipl e Personality Disorder case, switching from personality to person ality during interviews. During the jury trial, according to Bow art, Moody's various personalities fought with each other. Of extreme interest is the fact that Moody was trai ned with the Navy Seals, had received a Top Secret clearance , and that during his time as a Seal, he had experienced \"miss ing time.\" Moody also told the court that the EBEs had origina lly contacted him while he was serving as a weather observer for military aircraft. This took place, Moody says, shortly afte r he had read a top secret government document of the crash of a fl ying saucer craft with alien bodies. Might this have been the b ogus MJ-12 document, and if so, who gave it to Moody? According to Bowart, Moody may have been set up for execution earlier than his conviction. Bowart state s, \"There even was one uncomfortable moment when Prosecutor D avid White placed one of the murder weapons, a large but cher knife, in an opened bag on Moody's desk for his inspection . \"I could imagine Moody taking it, making a sudden m enacing gesture before being shot down in the crossfire of the three deputies in the courtroom.\" Prosecutor White focused on the EBE's in his closin g statements, presumably concerned that Moody might r eceive an acquittal by reason of insanity. White asked, \"Did the aliens need the money to buy plutonium to fuel their space ships?\" White's contention was that Moody was making up the aliens in order to feign insanity for the jury. \"The aliens a re innocent!\" the prosecutor concluded. He may have been on to something. As Walter Bowart said, \"Many were disappointed that the aliens were not called to testify.\" The jury found Moody guilty on two counts of first degree murder.

Laing, author of the popular The Politics of E xperience and an associate of the Tavistock Institute, probably k new what he was talking about when he stated in an interview in Omni magazine, \"In the late 'sixties it became apparent to the eli te with responsibilities for 'control of the population' th at the old idea of putting people in the proverbial bin and keeping them there for life—warehousing people—wasn't cost-effective. The Reagan administration in California was one of the first t o realize this. So they had to rethink just what the name of the ga me was. That has led to a schism between what is said to th e general public and what is practiced by the executive in co ntrol of mental health. The same problem prevails across Eur ope and the Third World. \"To see what is happening, look at the textbook or manual called DSM-III: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manu al on Mental Disorders (third edition, published by the American Psychiatric Association). Translated into economic and politica l terms, mental disorder means undesired mental states and b ehavior. The criteria for mental disorder in DSM-III include any unusual perceptual experience, magical thinking, clairvoyan ce, telepathy, sixth sense, sense of a person not actua lly present. You're allowed to sense the presence of a dead rela tive for three weeks after their death. After that it becomes a cr iterion of mental disorder to have those feelings. \"...these are not exceptional examples out of DSM-I II. The overall drift is what contemporary modern psychiatr y, epitomized by this DSM manual translated into eight een languages, is imposing all over the world—a mandate to strip anyone of their civil liberties, of habeas corpus; and to apply involuntary incarceration, chemicalisation of a per son, electric shocks, and non-injurious torture; to homogenize pe ople who are out of line.

One of their strategies for experimentation as well as social manipulation was in the creation of mind control cults. I do not maintain that all off-the-wall mystical or religious groups practicing mental manipulation were formed b y intelligence agencies as test tubes for their proje cts. Examining various groups, however, solid connections to intel ligence agencies are apparent in many of them. The apparenc y is that many of these groups have been formed in this way, while others have been infiltrated and influenced. A few examp les: —Charles Manson's leering face—with or without the homemade swastika tattoo on his forehead—is one of the defining images of the 1960s. It is perhaps one of the \" Changing Images of Man.\" Presented by the media a s a madman holding his small band of followers under hi s sway in the desert, sallying forth to murder the rich and t he famous, there is much to suggest that this is not the whole of the story. Manson was released from a California prison in 196 7, and under the stipulations of his parole reported to Ro ger Smith at the Haight Ashbury Medical Clinic in San Francisco, a facility sponsored by NIMH. The Haight Ashbury district itse lf was termed a \"human guinea pig farm\" by one CIA agent. Dr. Louis Jolyon West, for one, was running a mysterious safe house in the Haight in the Summer of Love. While in prison Manson was connected to the AMORC Rosicrucians, the same group that Sirhan Sirhan had ties to. Manson was also in touch with members of The Proces s, an apocalyptic Scientology spinoff group, and he dubbe d his own group the Final Church using Process terminology. I n San Francisco Manson lived at 636 Cole Street while the Process group lived at number 407, close to the center of a ctivity in the Haight. Manson's reported plan to unleash the apoca lyptic \"Helter Skelter\" revolution also seems to have been copped straight from Process theology, but there is a fami liar ring. The \"process\" of The Process is identical to that of Ta vistock, the return of the blank slate, the tabula rasa through violence. David Berkowitz, convicted for the Son of Sam murde rs, later linked Manson to the L.A.-based wing of the Satanic cult he was a member of, reportedly termed \"the Children.\" Manson is also alleged to have been connected to Scientology, as w ell as to a 174"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"coven in New Orleans whose members supposedly inclu ded Janis Joplin and the University of Texas tower snip er Charles Whitman. [2] Manson's base of operation was at the Spahn Movie R anch, later bought out by the owners of the ranch next do or, the German Krupp family, who were key to the arming of the Third Reich. [3] Manson—as well as alleged RFK assassin Sirhan Sirha n—are reported to have attended drug orgies at the Polans ki/Tate mansion. Actress Sharon Tate was the daughter of an Army Intelligence officer, and her husband, Roman Polans ki, directed the satanic-themed film Rosemary's Baby. Polanski l ater fled the United States after a statutory rape accusation. Br itish warlock Alex Saunders claims that he personally initiated S haron Tate into witchcraft. Jay Sebring, another of the victim s, according to Sammy Davis Jr.'s biography, Why Me?, had acted as a high priest at a satanic simulated sacrifice. Sebring ha d visited the Spahn Ranch in the company of a woman in a wig iden tified as \"Sharon.\" Robert F. Kennedy is reported to have eaten dinner at the Polanski place the day before his assassination, a connection that may resonate with the Sirhan role in the murder. The mansion where the five murders were committed o n August 9, 1969, at 10050 Cielo Drive, was sublet by Roman Polanski from Terry Melcher, who was friends with M anson. Three days before the murder, a drug dealer was pub licly whipped at Cielo. According to actor Dennis Hopper, \"They had fallen into sadism and masochism and bestiality—and they recorded it all on videotape, too. The L.A. police told me this. I know that three days before they were killed twenty -five people were invited to that house for a mass whipping of a dealer from Sunset Strip who'd given them bad dope.\" On August 5, shortly before the murders, Manson was at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California. Esalen, re markably enough, is a New Age capitol assisted in its foundi ng in 1962 by Aldous Huxley, and involved in sponsoring various k inds of meditational training and speakers. Process founder Robert DeGrimston is reported to have spoken at Esalen. On e of the victims of the Tate murders was Abigail Folger, the coffee heiress. She had attended sessions at Esalen. According to an Esalen newsletter, \"Esalen started in the fall of 1962 as a forum to bring together a wide variety of approaches to enhancement of the human potential... including experiential sessions involving encounter gr oups, sensory 175"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"awakening, gestalt awareness training, and related disciplines. Our latest step is to fan out into the community at large, running programs in cooperation with many different institu tions, churches, schools, hospitals, and government.\" In o ther words, \"societry,\" to use the terminology of another organ ization. At the murder site, Tate was hung upside down in th e image of the Hanged Man Tarot card, a popular way for dis patching occultic traitors. Were there puppeteers other than Charlie standing b ehind the Manson family murders? David Berkowitz, convict ed for the Son of Sam killings, said that Manson \"volunteered to do the killings\" for someone else. One of the names that c onsistently comes up in investigations of the Manson family is The Process, but investigator Ed Sanders, who wrote a book on th e Manson family, said, \"There were so many investigations go ing on out there after the murders that I began to wonder if t he Process was a front for some intelligence operation.\" An ex-Processan provides more solid information: \"Y ou know, a lot of people say The Process is a fascist organi zation. It's actually half-true. It was founded by the German De mocratic Party, a neo-Nazi group in Germany as a front to ra ise money over here in the States. But since that time it's g rown more or less independent of the German group. I know a numb er of American Nazis and fascists who won't have anything to do with The Process. They say they don't want to be a part of a group that's run by Europeans.\"[4] —An operation apparently sprung from the dragon's t eeth of the CIA and the Louis Jolyon West Violence Center p roject was the Symbionese Liberation Army. Colston Westbrook w as a Black CIA psychological warfare expert who had participat ed in Operation Phoenix in Vietnam, and was a part of Pac ific Engineering Company, a subsidiary of Pacific Corpor ation, reportedly the largest CIA cut-out in the world. Ti me Magazine at the time simplified things by abbreviating his c redentials to being simply a \"linguist.\" Apparently based upon th at job description, Westbrook got a job teaching \"Black Le xicon\" at UC Berkeley, then whipped up what was called the Black Cultural Association at the infamous Vacaville Medical Facil ity—actually a prison—in California. The program was organized by Donald DeFreeze, who had been a member of the Los Angeles Police Department's Public Disorder Unit between 1967-69. DeFreeze, according to researcher Alex Constantine, \"described his incarceration on the prison's third floor, where he was corralled by CIA agents who drugged him and said he 176"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"would become the leader of a radical movement and k idnap a wealthy person. After his escape from Vacaville (an exit door was left unlocked for him), that's exactly what he did.\" Westbrook reportedly gave DeFreeze the handle \"Cinq ue Mtume,\" and worked up the cobra logo for the SLA. T he same logo was also used by alleged police agent Ron Kare nga and his US Organization. [5] After DeFreeze escaped from Vacaville he ended up o n the doorsteps of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War a nd the Venceremos Brigade, offering his services as a hit man. This is a standard method of establishing an identity in unde rground cadres, by stepping forth as the \"baddest of the ba d.\" Joseph Remiro and Nancy Ling Perry, members of the SLA, were political conservatives, according to research er Mae Brussel, \"with a kill-a-Commie-for-Christ backgroun d.\" Both were also drug addicts, a useful part of their prof ile. Bill and Emily Harris, also members, had no discernible back ground in radical politics, but came from the University of I ndiana, a school used in the recruitment of the CIA. They had worked as a narc team for the Indiana State Police. The major ity of individuals linked to the SLA by the police, in fac t, had no earlier connection to radical politics, although se veral had worked with Colston Westbrook and Donald DeFreeze a t Vacaville. [6] On February 4, 1974, the SLA kidnapped Patricia Hea rst, heir to the Hearst newspaper fortune. She was reportedly brainwashed and recruited as a member of the group, and was utilized in several very visible fund-raising event s held at banks. She was arrested on September 18, 1975. During the period that Hearst was eluding the polic e, there were one or more Hearst doubles in action. Research er John Judge said in an interview, \"There was a pick-up of somebody who said that she wasn't Patty Hearst but she looke d exactly like her and she had gone to school up in Cleveland. A c op picked her up, and she had a scar in the same place, and e verything was identical, but she wasn't Patty Hearst. Then an FBI agent supposedly came into the scene and said that if she ever got picked up again all she had to do was tell them to call this FBI agent and he would clear her—so it was a perfect wa y for Patty to move if there was an accidental pick-up—they had cr eated a phony double.\" [7] The media inflated stories of the SLA into what see med to be the beginnings of a racial war—although it may have actually been planned that way. Then the cavalry arrived. On M ay 17, 1974, 177"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"the headquarters of the SLA in Los Angeles was surr ounded by 150 LAPD officers, 100 FBI, 100 Sheriffs Department officers, 15 highway patrolmen, and 25 motorcycle officers pr oviding traffic control. The cops flamed the place, with si x SLA members killed. After the burning of the SLA headquarters, CIA-fund ed psychiatrists Martin Orne, Louis Jolyon West, and R obert Jay Lifton provided psychological pre-trial examination s of Patty Hearst. Another psychiatrist called upon to testify in the Hearst trial was Margaret Singer, who had studied returned Korean War prisoners at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Rese arch in Maryland, worked with West at his Hashbury safe hou se, and who provided a book blurb on Raven, by Tim Reiterma n and John Jacobs, a report on the Jim Jones' People's Te mple that conveniently overlooked information linking the gro up to the CIA. Orne and Singer later turned up as directors of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, a group whose board is primarily made up of CIA and military doctors. The purpose of the group is to disprove claims of cult mind control. [8] Here is Hearst's account of what happened after her arrest: \"When the first of the psychiatrists came to see me on September 30, just eleven days after my arrest, I s imply crumbled under his scrutiny. I cried, murmuring and mumbling out replies that were not answers to his questions. He thought I was refusing to cooperate with him. This was Dr. Lo uis Jolyon West, Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at U CLA, Director of the Neuropsychiatric Institute, Psychia trist-in-Chief of UCLA Hospitals, a licensed M.D., Chairman of the Council on Research and Development of the American Psychiatri c Association, psychiatric consultant to the Air Forc e, author of books and studies on prisoners of war, an internati onally recognized expert in his field. I thought he had a creepy hypnotic voice. A tall, heavy-set man who appeared to be kindly, I suspected 'Jolly' of being too smooth, too soothi ng to be trusted.\" [9] Another of the shrinks to examine Hearst after her capture was Dr. Martin Orne, a CIA/Navy doctor involved dur ing the 1960s in mind control experiments underwritten by t he Human Ecology Fund and the Scientific Engineering Institu te, both CIA fronts. At one point Orne boasted that he received routine briefing on all CIA behavior modification experimen ts. Orne is also one of the original members of the False Memor y Syndrome Foundation, a group of psychiatrists, many o f them with 178"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"backgrounds linked to the CIA, whose mission is to prove that cult mind control and ritual child abuse does not e xist. [10] —The sound track for the '60s is of course provided by the Grateful Dead LSD and rock and roll organization. U ntil the death of leader Jerry Garcia, the Dead were arguabl y the most influential \"cult\" in operation. The first member o f the Grateful Dead to take LSD, Robert Hunter, did so under the a uspices of a \"government sponsored\" Stanford University drug stu dy. An FBI internal memo from 1968 also mentions the employmen t of Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead as an avenue \"to channel youth dissent and rebellion into more benign and non-thre atening directions.\" It is obvious that with their \"laid-ba ck,\" non- politically involved stance, that the Grateful Dead have performed a vital service in distracting many young persons into drugs and mysticism, rather than politics. Whether they knew they were performing the service is a matter of arg ument. [11] —Another repository of deadheads was Jonestown, the dystopic community established by evangelist Jim Jo nes in Guyana, South America. Most of us are familiar with the tragedy: nearly 1,000 members of the People's Temple are rep orted to have committed suicide there by drinking cyanide on the orders of Jones. But there is more to this apparent mass s uicide than meets the eye in the triangle. Jonestown, without a doubt, was an MKULTRA project. Suspicious associations of Jim Jones go back many y ears, to the man's boyhood, and his lifelong friendship with Dan Mitrione. Mitrione trained in the CIA-financed Inte rnational Police Academy. He may have been the source of Jone s' unexplained funding when in 1961 Jones travelled to Brazil. Mitrione, \"working closely with the CIA at that poi nt\", accompanied him. At the time, Jones explained to hi s Brazilian neighbors that he was employed by Navy Intelligence , and both his food and the large house he and his small group lived in were provided by the U.S. Embassy. According to a l ocal resident, Jones \"lived like a king.\" At the time, J ones was making regular trips to Belo Horizonte, the headqua rters of the CIA in Brazil. In 1963 Jones returned to the States , with an unexplained windfall of $10,000, sufficient to laun ch his next operation. [12] In Ukiah, California, Jones established the first P eople's Temple. The Happy Havens Rest Home was also set up in the same location, guarded by electric fences, guard to wers, dogs, and armed guards dressed in black. Persons attempti ng to leave the compound were sometimes forcibly restrained. There were 179"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"at least 150 foster children living at the c amp, along with elderly persons, prisoners, and psychiatric patient s. At that time the People's Temple linked up with the Mendocino State Mental Hospital, and members of the group were trained in medical techniques there. It is rep orted that in a short while the entire staff of the mental hospit al were members of Jones' People's Temple. California virtually handed the Mendocino State Men tal Hospital to Jim Jones on a silver platter. Accordin g to researcher Michael Meiers, \"The Mendocino Plan was a pilot program of the federal government designed to evalu ate the feasibility of deinstitutionalizing the mentally il l. Dennis Denny, Mendocino's Director of Social Services, has specul ated that the Mendocino Plan was the sole reason that Jim Jones m oved to Ukiah.\" During the period that Jones was in Ukiah, Jones' group conducted behavior modification experiments o n both the patients in the mental hospital, and on Jones' cong regation. Jones used sensory deprivation on some of his congr egation during this period, and it is said that Jones' expe rtise in the technique was passed on to Donald DeFreeze of the S ymbionese Liberation Army, who would later use the method on Patty Hearst. [13] In Ukiah, Jones is reported to have been in touch w ith CIA- connected World Vision, an evangelical anti-Communi st church union that includes far-right church groups like Ca rl McIntyre's International Council of Christian Churches. World Vision is said to have employed Mark David Chapman, the murderer o f John Lennon. John Hinckley, Sr., the father of the man w ho shot Ronald Reagan, is a friend of Reagan's Vice Preside nt George Bush—significant for the possible motive—and ran a World Vision mission in Denver, Colorado. Another of Hinckley Sr .'s sons was to have dinner with Neil Bush on the day of the att empted assassination. Hinckley, Jr. was a prime candidate for mind contro l assassination programming. He was the recipient of mood- altering drugs from his hometown psychiatrist, and was on Valium when he shot Reagan. His \"double,\" a man nam ed Richardson, who followed Hinckley in Colorado and w rote love letters to Jody Foster, was a follower of Carl McIn tyre. Hinckley also claimed to have met with David Berkowitz, the \"Son of Sam\" murderer, while in Colorado. [14] In Ukiah Jim Jones hobnobbed with all the pillars o f the community, and allied himself with Walter Heady, th e leader of the local John Birch Society. Members of the Peop le's Temple 180"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"organized voting drives for Richard Nixon, worked w ith the Republican Party, and Jones was appointed chairman of the county grand jury. A number of persons who would soon be influential i n the People's Temple joined the group in Ukiah. Accordin g to researcher John Judge, \"Most of the top lieutenants around Jones were from wealthy, educated backgrounds, many with connections to the military or intelligence agencie s. These were the people who would set up the bank accounts, complex legal actions, and financial records that put peopl e under the Temple's control.\" [15] Among the most important of Jones' known supporters —who knows what scoundrels might have been lurking behin d the scenes?—were the aristocratic Layton family, who fi nanced Jones with large sums of money, and are related to wealthy British and German families.

Layton's stockbroker father-in-law rep resented the German I.G. Farben monolith. The parents of Geo rge Philip Blakey, the husband of the former Debbie Layton, al so had large holdings in Solvay Drugs, a division of I.G. Farben . Blakey is reported to have been a CIA operative and to have r un mercenaries out of Jonestown, supplying forces to t he CIA- backed UNITA in Angola. Blakey is reported to have made the original $650,000 deposit on the land in Guyana tha t was to become Jonestown. [16] Another prominent alleged member of the People's Te mple was Timothy Stoen, the Assistant District Attorney of San Francisco. Jones utilized his people to organize a voting drive for Mayor Moscone, and was rewarded by being put in charge of the San Francisco Housing Commission, a fact never mentioned in the mainstream press. Many of Jones' followers o btained jobs at the city Welfare Department, and were able to us e those positions to gain recruits for the Temple. Seven mysterious deaths connected to the People's T emple were reported in the local press, and increased scr utinization by the media and politicians apparently led Jones to p ull up stakes and move his operation to Guyana. Guyana was not Jo nes' initial choice as a site for relocation. He had earlier dec ided on Grenada, and deposited $200,000 in the Grenada Nati onal Bank in 1977. After the Jonestown massacre, $76,000 rema ined in the bank. 181"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The Jonestown location is a rich source of minerals and had earlier been the site of a Union Carbide bauxite an d manganese mine. There had been earlier plans to bring in larg e numbers of workers to the area, going back as far as 1919. In current years, the area has been repopulated by 100,000 Lao tian Hmong people. [17] After the Guyanese location for the People's Temple was decided upon, it was prepared for habitation by mem bers, with the cooperation of local officials and the U.S. Emb assy. The Information Services Company states that \"The U.S. Embassy in Georgetown Guyana housed the Georgetown CIA station . It now appears that the majority and perhaps all of the em bassy officials were CIA officers operating under State Department covers.\" Among embassy officials verified as being agents of the CIA are U.S. Ambassador John Burke, who attempted to st op Congressman Leo Ryan's investigation of Jonestown; Dan Webber, who was at the site of the massacre the fol lowing day; and Chief Consular Officer Richard McCoy, on loan f rom the Defense Department and reportedly \"close\" to Jones. [18] The Jonestown compound in Guyana consisted of an hierarchical structure with an elite composed of al l white male camp guards who received special privileges, and wh o were allowed to leave the camp freely and to carry money . Some of the white guards had been employed as mercenaries i n Africa and elsewhere. The guards survived the Jonestown tr agedy. The rest of the camp was 90% women, and 80% Black, and they existed under slave labor conditions, working 16 to 18 hours daily, with miserable rations. When Black members o f the Temple arrived from the United States, they were bo und and gagged before being taken to the compound. Once ins ide Jonestown, perceived infractions led to forced drug ging, public rape, torture, and beatings. [19] Jeannie Mills, a member of the People's Temple, rep orted that she had seen films taken inside a Chilean tort ure camp, either Colonia Dignidad or another located at Pisag ua, while at Jonestown. These camps have documented connections to the CIA as well as to Fourth Reich Nazis, with visits r eported from the negatively notable such as Dr. Josef Mengele an d Martin Bormann. The Jonestown mass suicide (or murder) was probably set off by the arrival in Guyana of Congressman Leo Ryan, w ho was perhaps the most active investigator in Washington of CIA abuses, and arguably number one with a bullet on th e CIA's lengthy hate list.

In response to stories of atrocities at Jones town, Ryan decided to investigate for himself—and that determi nation sealed his fate. After travelling to Jonestown and attempting to ret urn to the States, Ryan, several reporters, and a Jonestown de fector were killed on an airstrip at nearby Port Kaituma, with the mass Jonestown deaths taking place shortly afterward. Ob servers reported that Ryan's group was killed by armed men who acted like \"zombies.\" Cheering was heard 45 minutes after the mass death at Jonestown, and those persons have never been accoun ted for. For that matter, practically no one at Jonestown ha s been accounted for. Robert Pastor, an aide to Zbigniew B rzezinski, at the time national security advisor to Jimmy Carter, sent orders to the U.S. military to remove \"all politically sen sitive papers and forms of identification from the bodies.\" [21 ] Dr. Mootoo, a Guyanese pathologist, was the first m edical person on the scene, and the first to examine the b odies of the victims.

The gun that Jones had reportedly used to commit suicide lay 200 feet away from his body. Mootoo concluded to the Guyanese gra nd jury that all but three of the victims had not committed suicide, but were murdered. When autopsies were performed at Dov er, Delaware, the forensic doctors were not informed of Dr. Mootoo's findings. The body identified as Jim Jones did not have Jones ' chest tattoos, and was so decomposed that it was not reco gnizable. Fingerprints on the body were checked twice, for no apparent reason—could it have been that they did not match Jones?—while his dental records were not consulted.

At the time of the Jonestown massacre, CIA agent Ri chard Dwyer, Deputy Chief of Mission for the U.S. Embassy in Guyana, was present. In a tape recording made immediately p rior, Jones can be heard saying, \"Get Dwyer out of here.\" At the end, Jones had accumulated assets estimated to be between $26 million and $2 billion.

There is no doubt in my min d that Jones had very close CIA connections. At the time of the tragedy, the Temple had three boats in the water off the coast. The boats disappeared shortly afterwards. Remember, Brazil is a country that Jones is very familiar with. He is supposed to have money there. And it is not too far from Guyana.

In one of his recorded lectures, Hubbard describes Parsons as bei ng the most brilliant man he ever met. Hubbard seems to have be en a sincere Crowleyite, regardless of the protestations of the church hierarchy. According to his son, Ron DeWolf, \"He wa s very interested in... the creation of what some people c all the Moon Child. It was basically an attempt to create an imm aculate conception, except by Satan rather than by God... g etting a satanic or demonic spirit to inhabit the body of a fetus. This would come about as a result of black-magic rituals , which included the use of hypnosis, drugs, and other dang erous and destructive practice...

When Crowley died in 1947, my father dec ided that he should wear the cloak of the beast and become th e most powerful being in the universe.\" [26] It is quite possible that Hubbard continued to be c onnected to U.S. intelligence after World War II. According to former CIA officer Miles Copeland, \"arrangements\" were made be tween the Agency and Scientology as well as the group Moral R e- Armament.

One of the men who approached B randt was later caught rifling the files of Washington, D .C. researcher Kris Jacobs. At that time he claimed he was from th e National Journalism Center. In another encounter, the same p erson showed a business card with the legend \"Hong Kong B usiness Today\". According to Brandt, who visited the warehouse head quarters of the Finders in Washington, D.C, \"It was clear... that most group members were world-class travelers, which inc luded travel to numerous Eastern Bloc countries. It was a ll a game to them. This was a small group—perhaps 40 adults—but they had no visible income to support their far-flung activi ties.\" The founder of the group is retired USAF Master Ser geant Marion David Pettie. He reportedly started the outf it as early as the 1950s, originally calling the group the Seekers . His wife, Isabel, was a support secretary for the CIA in Fran kfurt, Germany, from 1957-61. Pettie's son George, accordi ng to one report, \"served in the CIA's drug activities in Air America during the Vietnam War.\" \"A three-page non-government memo of undetermined origin\" cited by Daniel Brandt provides additional information about Pettie.

The children were covered with insect bites, were very dirty and most of the children were not wearing underwear and all the chi ldren had not been bathed in many days.\" One of the arresting officers voiced suspicions abo ut the children being used in pornography in Mexico. A sea rch warrant was issued for the Finders' Washington, D.C . headquarters, and police entered the building on Fe bruary 5, 1987.

In the first handwritten missive he sent to t he New York police he wrote, \"I am the 'Son of Sam.' I am a lit tle 'brat',\" the possible implication being that he is an army brat. He also wrote, \"I am on a different wave length than everyb ody else—programmed to kill.\" [29] Berkowitz joined the New York Police auxiliary whil e in high school, and it is reported that he was tipped off f rom within the department when the police became aware that he was the—or one of the—Son of Sam murderers. Retired NYPD detec tive Sgt. Joseph Coffey has stated that he was ordered to des troy a letter that was sent to Berkowitz by Police Commissioner M ichael Codd, and that he carried out the order.

He travelled back and forth between North Dakota and Yonkers, New York, where Berkowitz lived, with trips coinciding with several of the \"Son of Sam\" killing s. Berkowitz was also identified by a witness as being in North Dakota, and John Hinckley, who attempted to assassi nate Ronald Reagan, has stated that he met Berkowitz in Colorad o.

In his first trip to Australia in 1986, Di Mambro is said to have held secret talks w ith \"individuals known to be linked to extreme Nazi-Mao ist activities in Australia.\" Over the next few years D i Mambro and Jouret would collectively make 11 trips to Australi a, open several bank accounts, and start a book publishing company. In 1993, Jouret and other members of the group in C anada were brought to trial on illegal weapons charges. J ouret pleaded guilty, then departed for France. According to one of the documents mailed to the press before the mass death , \"...the year 1993 was marked in Quebec by the political-jud icial scandal perpetrated against the Order of the Solar Temple a nd ARCHS. Amongst numerous members as well as the principal p eople in charge, Mr. Jean-Pierre Vinet and Dr. Luc Jouret we re the victims of slander and false accusations of the mos t sordid kind for many months, such as: debauchery, individual or collective manipulation, swindling, illegal drug dealing, poss ession of weapons, etc... \"Let us remember that more than 80 agents of the Se curity Guard of Quebec were mobilized to la unch a general 194"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"investigation of the activities of the above-mentio ned organizations.

If it were not for its tragic and pitiful aspect, one would wa nt to laugh at the absurdity of the affair. \"Throughout the investigation, unscrupulous reporte rs excelled in perfidious manipulations consisting of misinforming the public. We specifically mention Mr. Pelchat, wh ose responsibilities were great during this somber and nauseating spectacle. \"Since no proof existed, government and police offi cials strove to fabricate an evil scenario of a 'plot of terrorists whose subversive activities were financed by dangerous se cts...'\" After the mass death of the Solar Temple, variously claimed to be suicide or murder, the Swiss magazine L'Hebdo stated that between $127 million and $253 million had been depo sited in Australian bank accounts by the Solar Temple. These funds were allegedly withdrawn from the accounts prior to the mass death, but are otherwise not accounted for. [33] —In the well-to-do suburb of Rancho Santa Fe near S an Diego, California, between March 23-25, 1997, 39 members o f the Heaven's Gate UFO cult ate phenobarbital-laced pudd ing, chased it with vodka, put plastic bags over their heads, a nd died. The group was founded by Marshall Herff Applewhite, the son of a Presbyterian minister who became a family man while working as a music professor at the University of Alabama i n the 1960s. Applewhite left his family and the college amid acc usations of a homosexual affair, and migrated to the University o f St. Thomas in Houston, Texas. Applewhite left there in 1970 du e to \"health problems of an emotional nature.\" Allegedly sufferi ng from depression and hearing voices in his head, he check ed into a hospital, asking for a cure for his homosexuality. According to Applewhite's sister he had experienced a heart atta ck and a near death experience at this time—some have sugges ted that, given his later career as a New Age messiah, this i s the time that Applewhite may have been contacted by an unspecifie d intelligence agency and activated as a cult leader. During this period Applewhite met Bonnie Lu Trusdal e Nettles, a New Ager who left her husband and four c hildren for Applewhite. They dubbed each other \"Bo\" and \"Peep ,\" but also 195"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"called themselves The Two, from the Book of Revelat ions. They began recruiting followers for HIM, Human Individua l Metamorphoses, promising inductees that they would be leaving on a UFO soon. The philosophy was a typically byzantine New Age formulation: There are two universes, one governed by physical laws, space and time, the other referred to as the Non-Temporal Universe, the Next Level, God, the Spiritual Ground , and the Holodeck (from Star Trek: The Next Generation), whe re the Energy God Being (EGB) exists. The Next Level is st ructured like a massive Earth corporation, with a complex py ramidal organization chart. Beings on the Next Level do not eat, but take their nourishment straight from the EGB. At a certain time in the past, Lucifer, a vice pres ident of the Next Level, and some of his followers broke away an d tried to form their own corporation. The Luciferians, accord ing to the HIM philosophy, are the guys who pilot the UFOs we see in the sky, and are engaged in performing medical experime nts and cloning on human beings. The master plan of the EGB is to harvest souls from the temporal universe every 2,00 0 years. Representatives act as recruiters, and then the enl istees are beamed to the Next Level. The group forbade intoxicants and sex—some of the m embers even going so far as to be castrated to avoid carna l desires. Contact with families was discouraged, and the memb ers were monitored closely, reportedly checking in with the leader every 12 minutes during waking hours. When the promised UFO didn't show, most of the the HIM recruits defected, with the core of the group, abou t 50 members, staying together and moving from one place to another around the country. Apparently Applewhite and Nettles changed their nam es every month or so to confuse the Luciferians who we re hot on their trail. At some point The Two began calling th emselves \"Do\" and \"Ti,\" from the musical scale. In 1985 Ti d ied from liver cancer. By 1993 the cult had taken on a more public face, a nd started calling themselves Heaven's Gate, announcing themse lves with an ad in USA Today declaring, \"UFO Cult Resurfaces with Final Offer.\" The ad promised \"the last chance to advance beyond human.\" In 1996 Heaven's Gate started a business designing Internet Web pages, called \"Higher Source Contract Enterpris es.\" They designed cut-rate Web pages for groups varying from a San Diego 196"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"polo club to a Christian music group.

As the c omet approached the group prepared to shed their \"earthl y containers.\" Curiously, some of the members talked about having a Chip of Recognition implanted in their skull, whereby they were able to recognize Luciferians when they came into contact w ith them. Whether this was a metaphor of 'spiritual sight,' o r an actual physical implant has not been determined. It is unl ikely that autopsies of the members of the group included skul l x-rays. A telling connection to Heaven's Gate was the murde r of Ian Stuart Spiro, his wife, and three children, on Nove mber 1, 1992. His family were killed in their home in San D iego, while Spiro was later found dead in the desert. Spiro was extensively connected to the CIA and British intelligence, and is reported to have been involved in a wide range of spy-biz, incl uding Iran- Contra and the October Surprise. At the time of his murder Spiro was assisting \"Danger Man\" Michael Riconisciu to in the collection of documents substantiating the Inslaw c ase, documented by myself and co-author Kenn Thomas in T he Octopus.

Th is is focused electromagnetic broadcasting, one application of wh ich is in weaponry. These weapons are part of the new \"non-le thal\" arsenal—a misnomer, since this weaponry might just as well be called a death ray—touted by the military as a huma ne way for conducting war in the years to come. It may also be a way of conducting \"peace\"—of the 1984 and Brave New World mind- controlled variety. Certainly this possibility has not been overlooked, as evidenced by the following quote from Zbigniew Brze zinski, in his Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technet ronic Era: \"It may be possible—and tempting—to exploit for str ategic- political purposes the fruits of research on the br ain and on human behavior. Gordon J.F. MacDonald, a geophysici st special- izing in problems of warfare, has written that arti ficially excited electronic strokes 'could lead to a pattern of osci llations that produce relatively high power levels over certain r egions of the earth... In this way, one could develop a system th at would seriously impair the brain performance of very larg e populations in selected regions over an extended period.' No ma tter how deeply disturbing the thought of using the environm ent to manipulate behavior for national advantages to some , the technology permitting such use will very probably d evelop within the next few decades.\" [1] Early electromagnetic weapons experiments were cond ucted by the Japanese during World War II. Information on these \"death rays\" was revealed when Japanese scientists were interrogated. According to reports of the scientist s the death ray was never used on humans, but was tested on animals . [2] In 1960 there were rumors of a fantastic new Soviet super weapon employing Nikola Tesla electromagnetic techn ology. With subsequent revelations about Soviet research i n these areas, it seems that these rumors were true. [3] During the 1960s high levels of electromagnetic rad iation were detected at the American embassy in Moscow. It was de- 201"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"termined that the face of the embassy was being sys tematically swept with electromagnetic emissions by the Soviets . One guess was that a microwave beam was used to activate elec tronic equipment hidden within the building; another guess was more macabre: that the beam was being used to disrupt th e nervous systems of American workers in the embassy. Giving weight to the latter supposition, many of the employees of th e embassy became ill. Ambassador Walter Stoessel suffered a r are blood disease likened to leukemia, and experienced headac hes and bleeding from the eyes. At least two other employee s contracted cancer. According to researcher Alex Con stantine, rather than informing embassy personnel of what was going on, the CIA chose to study the effects of the irradiati on. Dr. Milton Zaret, called in to investigate what was termed \"the Moscow Signal,\" reported that the CIA wondered \"whether I thought the electromagnetic radiation beamed at t he brain from a distance could affect the way a person might act,\" and, \"could microwaves be used to facilitate brainwashin g or to break down prisoners under investigation.\" Zaret's conclu sion about the Moscow Signal was that, \"Whatever other reasons the Russians may have had, they believed the beam would modify the behavior of personnel.\" [4] Author Len Bracken, who was present in Moscow at th e time, has stated to the author in correspondence that the microwave radiation was beamed from a shack on a building acr oss from the embassy. In 1977 the microwave shack caught fire an d burned. Bracken says, \"It was a Friday night and the Marine House Bar was playing 'Burn, Baby, Burn' [i.e. \"Disco Inferno \"].\" Bracken also relates that \"in '79 a strange box was install ed in the wall in my room [in Moscow], supposedly relating to the hea ting system.\" [5] Irradiation of the American embassy reportedly prom pted a response from the Americans: the Defense Advanced R esearch Projects Agency's Project PANDORA, conducted at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research from 1965 to 1970. One aspect of the project involved bombarding chimpanze es with microwave radiation. Referencing a reported stateme nt by the head of the project, \"the potential for exerting a degree of control on human behavior by low level microwave ra diation seems to exist and he urged that the effects of mic rowaves be studied for possible weapons applications.\" Within three years, Dr. Gordon J.F. McDonald, a sci entific advisor to the president at the time, indicated tha t \"Perturbation of the environment can produce changes in 202"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"behavioral patterns.\" The perturbation that McDonal d was alluding to was EM waves, and the changes in behavi or were altered brain wave patterns. [6] In 1965 the McFarlane Corporation in America came u p with the Buck Rogers-sounding \"modulated electron gun X- ray nuclear booster,\" a breakthrough in the \"death ray\" technology. Reports indicate that the device could also be used in communications, telemetry, and remote controlled gu idance systems. McFarlane later claimed that the system wa s stolen from him by NASA, and that the principles of the ac knowledged death ray were employed in MIROS, an orbital \"commu nications system\"; at least that is the way it was described by NASA. [7] In 1972 the army admitted extensive research into t he effects of irradiation on life forms, and the techn ology of electro- magnetic weaponry. One of the byproducts of this re search led to the invention of a powerful \"electronic flame th rower.\" This may have been the weapon described in a study of th e U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center, \"Analysis of Microwaves for Barrier Warfare,\" descr ibing the use of electromagnetic energy for an anti-personnel and vehicle weapon. The weapon discussed in this study was stat ed to be capable of producing third-degree burns on human sk in. [8] Dr. Dietrich Beischer, a German scientist employed by the American government, irradiated 7,000 naval crewmen with potentially harmful levels of microwave energy at t he Naval Aerospace Research Laboratory in Pensacola, Florida , and talked about it at a symposium in 1973. Dr. Beischer disap peared soon after the experiment. According to PANDORA alumnus Robert O. Becker, he was to spend some time with Beischer but, \"Just before the meeting, I got a call from him. With no preamble or explanation, he blurted out: 'I'm at a pay phone. I can't talk long. They are watching me. I can't come to the mee ting or ever communicate with you again. I'm sorry. You've been a good friend. Goodby.' Soon afterward I called his office at Pensacola and was told, 'I'm sorry, there is no one here by t hat name,' just as in the movies. A guy who had done important rese arch there for decades just disappeared.\" [9] According to Eldon Byrd, of the Naval Surface Weapo ns Center in Silver Springs, Maryland, \"Between 1981 a nd September 1982, the Navy commissioned me to investi gate the potential of developing electromagnetic devices tha t could be used as non-lethal weapons by the Marine Corps for the purpose of 'riot control,' hostage removal, embassy and shi p security, clandestine operations, and so on.\" Byrd wrote of experiments 203"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"in irradiating animals with low level electromagnet ic fields, mentioning changes in brain function, and stating t hat the animals \"exhibited a drastic degradation of intelli gence later in life... couldn't learn easy tasks... indicating a v ery definite and irreversible damage to the central nervous system o f the fetus.\" The experiments went farther. Byrd wrote that, \"At a certain frequency and power intensity, they could make the animal purr, lay down and roll over.\" [10] By the early 1970s, according to Robert C. Beck, \"A necdotal data amassed suggesting that a pocket-sized transmi tter at power levels of under 100 milliwatts could drastica lly alter the moods of unsuspecting persons, and that vast geogra phical areas could be surreptitiously mood manipulated by invisi ble and remote transmissions of EM [electromagnetic] energy .\" [11] In the late 1970s Russian negotiators at the Strate gic Arms Limitation talks (SALT II), proposed banning \"a new generation of weapons of mass destruction\" employing electroma gnetic pulses. It has been suggested that the Russians, in proposing the ban, were attempting to feel out the Americans as to the current state of their electromagnetic weapons rese arch. The Americans did not seem to have a clue as to what th e Russians were talking about, and the proposal was tabled. In fact, some Americans knew exactly what the Russi ans were talking about, although the Reds had a significant head start on several fronts. In 1959 Russian scientists Gaponov, Schneider, and Pantell had conceived of what was called a cycl otron resonance maser, essentially an industrial strength tunable ray gun. Beginning about 1966, the Russians launched in to a heavily funded crash project to develop the gyrotron, anoth er form of electromagnetic \"gun,\" and in 1971 they were engage d in their first field tests with the gyrotron. In 1975, physicists M.S. Rabinovich and A.A. Rukhad ze and others active in Russian strategic defense at the L ebedev Physics Institute in Moscow announced that using a cyclotro n resonance maser, they had produced microwave bursts that far outstripped anything the Americans were even theoretically prop osing and that, according to the analysis of the American mil itary, were powerful enough to be used in weapons applications. A report from the American Rand Corporation at the time concluded that the Russian experiments were part of a larger Russian program designed for the production of elec tromagnetic weaponry, centered at the Institute of Applied Phys ics in Gor'kiy, Lebedev Physics Institute in Moscow, and a nother group of research institutes in Tomsk. By the 1980s, it was reported, 204"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Russian gyrotron weapons had been reduced in size s o that they would fit into a regular military truck, and had th e capability of wiping out large military implacements or, at lower frequencies, irradiating whole towns. [12] In 1982 the Air Force released a review of the use of electromagnetics on life forms, saying \"Currently a vailable data allow the projection that specially generated radio frequency radiation (RFR) fields may pose powerful and revolu tionary antipersonnel military threats. Electroshock therap y indicates the ability of induced electric current to complete ly interrupt mental functioning for short periods of time, to ob tain cognition for longer periods and to restructure emotional res ponse over prolonged intervals. \"...impressed electromagnetic fields can be disrupt ive to purposeful behavior and may be capable of directing and/or interrogating such behavior. Further, the passage o f approximately 100 milliamperes through the myocardi um can lead to cardiac standstill and death, again pointin g to aspeed-of- light weapons effect. A rapidly scanning RFR system could provide an effective stun or kill capability over a large area.\" [13] In 1984 the program researching the creation of pul sed microwaves was stepped up at Lawrence Livermore Nat ional Laboratories. [14] According to the Oregon Journal, in March, 1978, in a story titled \"Mysterious Radio Signals Causing Concern,\" the city of Eugene was irradiated by microwaves possibly beamed from a Navy transmitter, located several hundred miles awa y in California. According to an FCC report, \"microwaves were the likely cause of several sudden illnesses among facu lty researchers at Oregon State University.\" Numerous r esidents also complained of headaches, insomnia, fatigue, sk in redness, and hearing clicks and buzzes in the head. A study conducted by the Pacific Northwest Center f or Non- Ionizing Radiation attributed the radiation instead to the Soviets, stating that it was \"psychoactive\" and \"very strong ly suggesting of achieving the objective of brain control.\" [15] In September 1985, members of the Greenham Commons Women's Peace Camp in Great Britain, a global milit arization protest camp located outside the U.S. Air Force Bas e at Greenham Commons, began experiencing a wide range o f unpleasant physical symptoms including headache, de pression, disorientation, memory loss, vertigo, and changes i n their menstrual cycles. According to Dr. Rosalie Bertell and others who researched what was going on, the symptoms were of the 205"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"type associated with exposure to radiation, and the y began shortly after security at the base was switched fro m human guards to primarily electronic surveillance—this wo uld have been a perfect opportunity to install electromagnetic br oadcasting units disguised as surveillance equipment. Dr. Bertell, former radar engineer Kim Besly, and o thers took readings of electromagnetic levels in the area, and found that they were as much as 100 times as strong as other n earby areas. [16] That the electromagnetic arsenal is being used agai nst citizenry in the new Russia is quite apparent from a statement published at the end of 1991 by SovData DiaLine: \"Psychological warfare is still being used by state security agents against people in Russia, even after the abo rtive August coup,\" said Emilia Chirkova, a Deputy of the Zeleno grad Soviet and member of the Human Rights Commission. She reca lls the scandal surrounding the alleged bugging equipment i nstalled close to Boris Yeltsin's office. KGB agents admitte d then that the directional aerial in the equipment was designe d for transmission, not for reception. She believes it wa s part of an attempt to affect the health of the Russian preside nt using high- frequency electromagnetic radiation. \"The Human Rig hts Committee,\" Chirkova said, \"had warned Yeltsin abou t such a possibility.\" Substantiation for Chirkova's allegations is provid ed by Victor Sedleckij, design engineer-in-chief for the center Forma and vice president of the League of Independent Soviet Scientists. Sedleckij stated, \"As an expert... I declare, in Ki ev was launched a mass production of psychotronic biogenerators and their tests. I cannot assert that during the [Moscow] coup d'eta t those used were the Kiev generators... All the same, that [psy chotronic generators] were used is evident to me. What are th e psychotronic generators? They are electronic equipm ent which produces the effect of guided control in human orga nisms. It affects especially the left and right hemisphere of the cortex. This is also the technology of the U.S. Project Zom bie 5... I draw on my personal experience since I am myself the des igner of such a generator.\" [17] Emilia Chirkova cited several instances of the use of similar devices. Microwave equipment had been used in 1989 and 1990 in Vladivostok and Moscow prisons, in a mental hospital in Oryol, and in the Serbsky Institute in Moscow [also a mental hospital], she said. During his exile in Gorky, And rei Sakharov noticed the presence of a high-tension electromagne tic field in 206"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"his flat. It was reported recently in the press tha t Ruslan Khasbulatov, Speaker of the Russian Parliament, had to move from his flat to another district of Moscow. High-l evel electromagnetic radiation has been included among t he possible causes of the discomfort he felt in his flat. Purported victims of psychological warfare have wri tten to the Russian paper. From Voronezh: \"They controlled my laughter, my thoughts, and caused pain in various p arts of my body... It all started in October 1985, after I had openly criticized the first secretary of the City Committe e of the Communist Party.\" \"Sometimes voices can be heard in the head from the effect of microwave pulse radiation which causes acoustic oscillations in the brain,\" explained Gennady Shchelkunov, a rad io electronics researcher from the Istok Association. In June 1991, a group of Zelenograd deputies sent an appeal signed by 150 people to President Yeltsin, demanding an inves tigation into the use of bio-electronic weapons. An experiment conducted on Cable News Network in th e mid-1980s demonstrated the reality of electronic de vices that can project images into the mind from a distance. P hysicist Dr. Elizabeth Rausher and electrical engineer Bill VanB ise built a radio frequency \"mind interference machine\" using i nformation in the open Soviet scientific literature. According to CNN, \"The machine was inexpensive and easy to construct using parts from a consumer electronics store. It emits a weak magne tic field pulsed at extremely low frequency.\" The network commentator, a Mr. DeCaro, said, \"As th e subject of the test I was blindfolded and my ears w ere blocked to prevent inadvertent clues as to what was happeni ng. A magnetic probe was placed about 18 inches from my h ead. As the experiment began, two signal generators produce d waveform patterns that were transmitted by the magn etic probe at about one one-thousandth of the earth's magnetic field.\" Here is a partial transcript of the exchange betwee n VanBise, Rausher, and DeCaro during the experiment: VanBise: Describe anything that you see. DeCaro: I could see waveforms changing shape in my mind... A parabola just went by... VanBise: Oh, yeah, I did. I just flipped the swit ch. Parabola? Rausher: Uh-huh. VanBise: All right, let's see. Check this out. That 's what happened, I flipped the switch. 207"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Rausher: Yeah! DeCaro: OK, a spike right there! Rausher: A spike there. DeCaro: A tight spike. VanBise: I dramatically changed the generator. I st epped it by ten right here, and the intermix from the two ge nerators was right where you said that you saw a spike. After the experiment, DeCaro interviewed VanBise, w ho said that the technology could \"induce basically what wo uld be considered hallucinations in people; direct them to do things against their so-called better judgment.\" DeCaro wondered, \"How easy would it be to assemble a weapon from existing off-the-shelf parts?\" \"Three weeks,\" VanBise responded, \"I could put toge ther a weapon that would take care of a whole town.\" [18] Portable electronic mind control weapons, small eno ugh to be transported by truck, are now reported to be use d routinely in offensive actions by the American military, and were employed in Grenada, Panama, and in the Gulf War. A lthough officially denied, it is reported that electromagne tic mind control weapons were used in Waco, Texas, in 1993, during the 51-day siege on David Koresh and his followers. Vid eo footage taken during the siege by the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) shows the deployment of several advanced weap ons systems, including a Soviet psychotronic weapon des igned by Dr. Igor Smirnov of the Moscow Medical Academy. Although it is denied that such weapons were used i n the Waco massacre, the government does admit that Feder al officials \"considered\" using Smirnov's acoustic psycho-correc tion projector on the Branch Davidians. It is also admit ted that a series of closed meetings regarding the Branch Davi dians took place beginning March 17, in northern Virginia betw een Smirnov and officials of the FBI, CIA, DIA, and DAR PA. According to one participant in the talks, \"There w as a strong interest among the intelligence agencies bec ause they had been tracking Smirnov for years, and because we know there is evidence the Soviet Army's Special Forces used the technology during the conflict in Afghanistan.\" An account of the meetings was issued in a memorand um of Psychotechnologies Corp of Richmond, Virginia. In t he memo it was noted that unspecified attendees of the meeting wondered whether \"psycho-correction detection, decoding and counter- measures programs should be undertaken by the U.S.\" [19] 208"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"A recent news release provides information on a new program by the National Institute of Justice, to de velop \"friendly force\" electromagnetic weapons for use in the U.S. According to Microwave News, Oak Ridge National Laboratory is looking into the possibility of \"thermal guns\" that would d isable an individual by causing his body to overheat, \"seizur e guns\" that would induce epileptic fits, and \"magnetosphere gun s\" that would cause a person to \"see stars.\" [20] In recent years, the heavy cost of research into el ectronic weaponry has been subsumed into the Strategic Defen se Initiative, also known—to the chagrin of George Luc as—as the Star Wars program.

A number of laborat ories were set up across the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europ e, including one at the Institute of Hygiene and Occupational Di seases, Academy of Medical Sciences. Although the Soviets r eported on their experiments in the open literature, the param eters they defined were insufficient for duplicating the exper iments, and some scientists in the United States questioned whe ther the whole matter was disinformation. It was not. [1] Early CIA funding provided the wherewithal for a pr oject launched at Honeywell, Inc. for \"a method to penetr ate inside a man's mind and control his brain waves over long di stance.\" At the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Maitland Baldwin, under CIA supervision, bombarded the brains of lobo tomized monkeys with radio waves. According to researcher A lex Constantine, \"His CIA monitors noted weird excesses : in one experiment, Baldwin decapitated a monkey and transp lanted its head to the body of another, then attempted to rest ore it to life with radar saturation.\" [2] In 1964, CIA Director Richard Helms sent a memo to the Warren Commission, mentioning \"biological radio communication.\" Helms' theorizing about such method s was truly reminiscent of Orwell's 1984. He said, \"Cyber netics [or computer theory] can be used in the molding of a ch ild's character, the inculcation of knowledge and techniq ues, the amassing of experience, the establishment of social behavior patterns... all functions which can be summarized a s control of the growth processes of the individual.\" [3] In 1977 Dr. Sam Koslov, the scientific assistant to the Secretary of the Navy, was briefed on a number of c urrent research projects. One of them, in progress at Stan ford Research Institute, was named \"ELF and Mind Control .\" ELF is the acronym for extremely low frequency electromagnetic 211"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"radiation. Koslov didn't like the sound of that pro ject and ordered it cancelled, but according to the Washingt on Post, the funding was merely diverted into a different projec t heading and continued to go forward. [4] The following report, although anonymous, provides a detailed first person encounter with what may be go vernment electromagnetic testing. It was published in an und erground magazine a few years ago. I do not maintain that re ports such as these are absolute proof of government electromagne tic testing on citizenry, but well-reasoned accounts such as th e following must be taken into consideration: \"The large black top of the Federal Building in San Francisco looks like a giant air-conditioning vent, 50 feet t all, comprising the entire top of the building. It is actually a ra dar, microwave, and radio transparent shield for an array of commun ications devices on the roof of the building. Such \"blinds\" on top of government buildings are nothing unusual, it isn't necessary to visually remind everybody that such buildings also are likenesses of Orwell's Ministry of Information (read, CIA). An d as such are in need of systems of communications independent of civilian mediums. Which, anyway, would be purposely interrup ted in any serious case of civil unrest. \"It is important to note three facts at this point, the purpose of which will come clear in the end: First, the Fed eral Building is located at the base of a broad hill. It is on th e low rise of this hill where San Francisco's 'Skid Row' district, the 'Tenderloin,' uneasily rests. And so the Federal Building can be seen from virtually any place in the Tenderloin. And let us r everse this thought; virtually any place in the Tenderloin may be seen from the Federal Building. And it is this unimpeded view which brings to mind the second oddly coinciding factor; that Low Frequency Electromagnetic emissions like television broadcasts will not pass through earth (hills, or the horizon) , nor do they even pass very well through buildings, and so requi re a fairly clear shot, unlike higher frequency emissions like radio. This is why you have to put TV antennas on the roof. \"Now fact three; Extremely Low Frequency transmissi ons, or ELFs, have been the focus of significant research b y the military intelligence machines of several governments, inclu ding our own. ELF developments for military purposes is base d on indications that ELFs at close range seem to cause aberrations in the thought processes of human beings, such as hall ucinations, disordered thought, confusion, aggression, depressi on, anger, hopelessness. Not unlike television, a close comp anion to ELFs 212"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"in (he electromagnetic spectrum. It is not difficul t to imagine the value of such a weapon to our secret government , so fond of the disruption of societies, the control and subjug ation of individuals, and of war, 'the insane death dance of paranoid societies.' \"Now with these three things in mind, consider this fourth. Since I have had the fortune to live for three year s in this ring of hell, the Tenderloin, I have noticed something very odd. At least 15 times I have noticed in the morning or ear ly evening a pronounced buzzing or humming. Very low and hard to hear. Something like the sound which some can hear of a T V that is on in a room, but with the volume off. And on looki ng for the source of this sound, I found that it seemed to com e from everywhere and nowhere. In other words it seemed to be coming from inside my head. I do not mean this figu ratively. I mean that my head seemed to resonate with the vibra tion. And I felt that my thoughts were disrupted. The buzzing s eemed to make thoughts fall apart just before forming, like sand on a vibrating metal plate, and I felt vaguely angry. On the third or fourth occurrence of this, I noticed that in the wa ke of the buzzing sound, an unusual number of fights could be heard breaking out all around me. From out on the streets , and from adjoining buildings, and apartments, came the shout s and threats of people overcome with anger. And I though t, though at first it seemed horrible to consider, 'Hadn't ELF s ubjects reported the feeling or sound of buzzing in their h eads?' and 'what better section of the population could be cho sen on which to conduct ELF experiments.' A large percentage of inner urban dwellers are already so close to the edge that he o r she is highly likely to express any fluctuation of mood with a co rresponding fluctuation of activity which might come to the att ention of the police. In a neighborhood where aberrant behavior i s common and expected, slight increases of such behavior wou ld go completely unnoticed, but would be detectable by ca reful observation of incoming reports to the police depar tment. It would be unlikely in the extreme that anyone would associate the strange buzzing sound with unaccountable accomp anying emotional swings. Impossible that someone would sus pect secret agents of systematically barraging the polit ically power- less with mood and consciousness ELF waves from ato p the Federal Building. But even if such an impossibility came to pass, and allegations were made, would they not automatic ally be discredited by the general perception of the poor ( i.e. Tenderloin inhabitants) as mentally unstable, alc oholic, drug 213"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"addicted, and of the government as an essentially w ell meaning parent, who would not really ever purposely harm he r children? \"Tests of ELF effects could be precisely monitored by the existing police department recording system (at no extra cost), all recorded on the justice system's networked nati onal computer system, containing exact times of complain ts, record of outcome, location, identity, profile, and crimin al history of all persons involved. Police department ignorance of th e tests would actually be desirable. The entire operation c ould be run by as few as two people. ELF broadcast times would simply be correlated with any flux of reports to the police d epartment. And the exact nature of the ELF effects on human em otion would be conveniently built into the data received from p olice reports. For example, an increase of domestic violence at 4% , and suicides 2%, perhaps one or two extra stabbings dur ing your special hour-long broadcast of the latest ELF 'Top Ten.' A decrease in premeditated crimes might indicate a br eakdown of thought process during the time of ELF transmission . Do you see? A double blind experiment (neither police nor populace have any idea) on a perfectly contained and monitor ed large population of control subjects, in a typical city, with an 'in place' monitoring system (police reports) with a plus or m inus accuracy allowance of virtually 0% since the experi ment can be performed an unlimited number of times over a perio d of years. Could such malignant experiments be pulled off in a ny other setting? If your aim were to induce murders, violen ce, psychosis, severe depression, or suicide, you could n't really go calling on John Hopkins University now, could you? Anyway, the very point of such a thing would be its use on urba n populations. Listen, you have a little country somewhere, you de stabilize the populace with ELFs and conventional means and overw helm the local law enforcement agencies, martial law is decl ared, the democratically elected government falls. You instal l a corrupt dictator. You say to the American people, 'We must send humanitarian aid.' A hundred million dollars is all ocated to the small country. The corrupt dictator steals the good s and money, and deposits the laundered free and clear taxpayer dollars in an offshore American bank. Beginning to get the pictur e? Think of how perfectly foolproof this is, how elegant, how a ppealing, how logical, how insidious, how horrible, how possible, and all it costs is the suffering of thousands of people. \"Postscript; last week the buzzing happened again, so loud yet so easily dismissed against the background of c ity noise. How could I prove to myself that it was not simply just coming 214"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"from my head, could I possibly have the rare hearin g condition, tinnitus, which causes ringing in the ears? I remem bered a Mr. Science experiment where the electromagnetic transp arency of various substances was being demonstrated. A portab le radio was placed into a wooden box. 'Hear that? The radio is still playing, which means? That's right, wood is electro magnetically transparent.' The radio was imprisoned in various o ther containers to see what would happen. Then finally i t was wrapped in aluminum foil, and fell silent. I ran in to the kitchen and grabbed the tin foil. Pulling a three foot stri p of it, I wrapped it around my head, and the buzzing stopped. \" [5] One of the strangest—and most ominous—episodes in t he history of electromagnetic irradiation research is the construction of the network of Ground Wave Emergenc y Network (GWEN) towers, in the 1980s. The GWEN tower s are almost 300 feet tall, and a 330-foot web of copper wiring extends out from them, broadcasting bursts of very low frequency (VLF) messages at 20 minute intervals or, from another source, hour intervals. These towers are sp aced 200 miles apart from each other and describe a straight line across America. At this time there are 54 operational towe rs, although at least 29 more are scheduled to be constructed. It is claimed that GWEN is part of the COG (Continu ity of Government) program of the Federal Emergency Manage ment Agency, designed to keep government functional in t he case of disaster, including nuclear war. Some sources disag ree that this is the purpose of the project, citing the statement of Colonel Paul Hanson, GWEN Program Director for the Air Forc e. Hanson has said, \"The towers will not help wage a nuclear war because they would be destroyed in any protracted confronta tion.\" Others note that since the GWEN hardware is transis tor based, they are particularly vulnerable to the electromagn etic pulses of nuclear explosions. The location of the GWEN towers is also a matter of public record, meaning that they could ea sily be targeted in case of war or even terrorist threat. [ 6] Robert O. Becker, M.D., in Crosscurrents: The Peril s of Electropollution, says of GWEN: \"GWEN is a superb s ystem, in combination with cyclotron resonance, for producing behavioral alterations in the civilian population. The average strength of the steady geomagnetic field varies from place to p lace across the United States. Therefore, if one wished to reso nate a specific ion in living things in a specific localit y, one would require a specific frequency for that location. The spacing of GWEN transmitters 200 miles apart across the United States 215"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"would allow such specific frequencies to be ' tailored' to the geomagnetic-field strength in each GWEN area.\" A similar system is SECOM II, composed of five broa dcasting towers in Idaho, New Mexico, Missouri, South Caroli na, and Maryland. These towers were ostensibly constructed as communication links between a central monitoring st ation and vehicles carrying nuclear weapons and nuclear mater ials. SECOM II broadcasts in the 3-12 Mhz range, which, coincidentally or not, precisely blankets the reson ant frequency of the human organism. [7] Another group of towers is mentioned in an anonymou s paper titled \"Mind Control Operations/Aquarius Group Acti vities,\" that states, \"With a general ignorance through arrogance of most public population in the U.S. the erection of large cellular towers being carried out under HIGH TONE and ZENO are larg ely going completely unnoticed. These projects are being carr ied out in private business capacities and therefore in Deep B lack Operations cover. However, public populations would be wise to educate themselves in the construction of these see mingly innocent towers in large population areas. The cell ular 800 MHZ waves are a constant wave. Due to the great pro liferation of towers in key population areas, they will have a de vastating effect.\" An oft-heard allegation is that the CIA has develop ed a mind control technology they refer to as RHIC-EDOM. The acronym stands for \"Radio Hypnotic Intracerebra Control—Ele ctronic Dissolution of Memory,\" and refers to the ability t o induce a hypnotic state from a remote location, impart hypno tic commands, and erase the memory of the programming a nd the period of time that it took place in. This technolo gy allegedly includes electromagnetic broadcasting as well as in tramuscular implants. The erasure of memory is reportedly accom plished by the electromagnetic stimulation of the chemical ace tylcholine in the brain. The first mention of RHIC-EDOM was in the 1969 book Were We Controlled? by the pseudonymous Lincoln Lawrence . Lawrence describes RHIC-EDOM in this manner: \"It is the ultra-sophisticated application of post- hypnotic suggestion triggered at will by radio transmission. It is a recurring hypnotic state, reinduced automatically a t intervals by the same radio control. An individual is brought un der hypnosis. This can be done either with his knowledge—or witho ut it by use of narco-hypnosis, which can be brought into play u nder many guises. He is then programmed to perform certain actions and 216"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"maintain certain attitudes upon radio signal.\" Lawrence claimed that Lee Harvey Oswald had been manipulated through RHIC-EDOM, but not by the Russi ans or the CIA or its brethren. According to Lawrence, Osw ald's controllers had been a worldwide cabal of commoditi es merchants who, through the assassination of the pre sident, wanted to drive stock down and make a fortune. The idea is not entirely implausible. The only other mention of RHIC-EDOM claiming inside r knowledge of the technology is an article by James L. Moore, in a 1975 issue of Modern People magazine. In that art icle, Moore claimed that he possessed a 350-page manual origina ting from CIA sources on RHIC-EDOM. The manual had supposedly been prepared by the CIA shortly after the murder of Joh n F. Kennedy. Verifying RHIC-EDOM are the researches of the late L.L. Vasiliev, professor of physiology at the University of Leningrad, who described one experiment in remote hypnosis usi ng undefined techniques of radio control: \"As a control of the subject's condition, when she was outside the laboratory in another set of experiments, a rad io set was used. The results obtained indicate that the method of using radio signals substantially enhances the experiment al possibilities. I.F. Tomaschevsky [a Russian physiol ogist] carried out the first experiments with this subject at a di stance of one or two rooms, and under conditions that the partici pant would not know or suspect that she would be experimented with. In other cases, the sender was not in the same house, and someone else observed the subject's behavior. Subsequent ex periments at considerable distances were successful. One such ex periment was carried out in the park at a distance. Mental s uggestions to go to sleep were complied with within a minute.\" [8 ] Interesting in the context of RHIC-EDOM technology is a statement made almost ten years after the publicati on of Were We Controlled? Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, the MKULTRA hea vyweight, during questioning by Senator Richard Schweicker in 1977 Senate hearings on CIA drug testing responded as fo llows: SCHWEIKER: Some of the projects under MKULTRA invol ved hypnosis, is that correct? GOTTLIEB: Yes. SCHWEICKER: Did any of these projects involve somet hing called radio hypnotic intracerebral control, which is a combination, as I understand it, in layman's term s, of radio 217"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"transmissions and hypnosis. GOTTLIEB: My answer is \"No.\" SCHWEICKER: None whatsoever? GOTTLIEB: Well, I am trying to be responsive to the terms you used. As I remember it, there was a current int erest, running interest, all the time in what effects peop le's standing in the field of radio energy have, and it could eas ily have been that somewhere in many projects, someone was trying to see if you could hypnotize someone easier if he was standi ng in a radio beam. That would seem like a reasonable piece of re search to do. [9] Another statement was made by J.F. Schapitz who, wo rking with the Department of Defense in 1974, filed the f ollowing research proposal: \"In this investigation it will be shown that the sp oken word of the hypnotist may be conveyed by modulated elect ro-magnetic energy directly into the subconscious parts of the human brain—i.e., without employing any technical devices for receiving or transcoding the messages and without the person exposed to such influence having a chance to control the infor mation input consciously.\" Schapitz proposed an experiment wherein a subject w ould be subconsciously told to leave the laboratory, the co mmand triggered by a word or action from the researcher. As in the tricks played by stage hypnotists, Schapitz was cer tain that the subject would rationalize the otherwise irrational desire to leave the lab. Records of Schapitz' research, beyond the initial proposal, have never been declassified. [10] In a way, proof of the existence of RHIC-EDOM does not much matter. It is not vitally important if Lincoln Lawrence or James L. Moore were speaking from personal knowledg e, or simply speculation that they wanted to render more believable. \"RHIC-EDOM\" is in essence just a name that describe s a technology close to or identical to others that hav e been demonstrated to exist. [11] A specific Russian mind control technology was oute d by the American Defense News in 1993, termed \"acoustic psy cho- correction.\" According to the magazine, \"The Russia n capability, demonstrated in a series of laboratory experiments dating back to the mid-1970s, could be used to suppress riots, control dissidents, demoralize or disable opposing forces a nd enhance the performance of friendly special operations team s, sources say. 218"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"\"Pioneered by the government-funded Department of P sycho- Correction at the Moscow Medical Academy, acoustic psycho- correction involves the transmission of specific co mmands via static or white noise bands into the human subconsc ious without upsetting other intellectual functions. Experts sai d that laboratory demonstrations have shown encouraging re sults after exposure of less than one minute.\" Janet Morris, science fiction author and research d irector of the U.S. Global Strategy Council, a Washington, D.C . think tank, is one of the leading lights in the field of non-le thal weaponry which in practice is a nice euphemism that includes techniques of mind control. According to Tactical Technology m agazine, \"While visiting Russia in November 1991, Morris and other members of a team sent to investigate Russian techn ologies for commercial development were invited to a demonstrat ion of a mind control technology. A volunteer from the U.S. team sat down in front of a computer screen as innocuous wor ds flashed across the screen. The volunteer was only required to tell which words he liked and which words he disliked. A t the end of the demonstration the Russian staff started reve aling the sensitive, innermost thoughts of the volunteer—none of which had been previously discussed. The recorded message was mixed with what appeared to be white noise or stati c, so when played back it became undecipherable. Since there w ere no more volunteers in the U.S. group, the Russians vol unteered to go upstairs and let the Americans choose a mental p atient for a demonstration. The Americans declined the offer. \"The Russians told Morris of a demonstration in whi ch a group of workers were outside the hospital working on the grounds. The staff sent an acoustic psycho-correcti on message via their machine to the workers telling them to pu t down their tools, knock on the door of the hospital and ask if there was anything else they could do. The workers did exactl y that, the Russians said. \"The Russians admitted to using this technology for special operations team selection and performance enhanceme nt and to aid their Olympic athletes and an Antarctic explora tion team. Unlike lie detectors, this machine can determine wh en the truth is spoken, according to Morris. \"Being an infrasound, very low frequency-type trans mission, the acoustic psycho-correction message is transmitt ed via bone conduction. This means that earplugs will not restr ict the message. An entire body protection system would be required to stop reception. The message, according to the Russians, 219"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"bypasses the conscious level and is acted on almost immediately. The Russians say that the messages are acted upon w ith exposure times of under one minute. \"Morris envisions this technology will be miniaturi zed into a hand-held device. Presently, the International Heal thline Corp. of Richmond, Va., is planning to bring a Russian te am of specialists to the U.S. in the near future to furth er demonstrate the capability. International Healthline is a priva te corporation that is exploring Russian medical technologies for import to the U.S.\" [12] A specific application of electronics in mind contr ol is in the direct broadcasting of audible sounds, including vo ices, to the human brain. In 1961, biophysicist Allen Frey, work ing for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), announced that h uman beings are capable of hearing microwave broadcasts, in the case of his experiments, what he described as buzzing or knocking sounds. Frey suggested \"stimulating the nervous sys tem without the damage caused by electrodes.\" [13] In 1973, Dr. Joseph C.Sharp, at Walter Reed Hospita l, while in a soundproof room heard spoken words broadcast b y \"pulsed microwave audiogram.\" Broadcast in a range between 300 MHz to 3GHz, Sharp was able to identify words that were broadcast without any form of electronic translation device—b y direct transmission to the brain. [14] A 1976 Defense Intelligence Agency report credited the Soviets with having made the same discovery as Shar p and Grove, although this was apparently disinformation in the interest of encouraging Congress to appropriate fun ding in order to play a pretended \"catch up\" with the Russians. [ 15] One electromagnetic weapon that transmits at the fr equency of the human nervous system is, according to resear cher Harlan Girard, manufactured by Loral Electro-Optical Syste ms in Pasadena, California. In substantiation, it is repo rted that Loral had previously done research on electromagnetic wea ponry for Lt. Gen. Leonard Peroots of the U.S. Air Force. Per oots is reported to have requested a weapon that would broa dcast negative messages directly to the minds of the enem y—and positive messages to the minds of friendly troops. [16] A study by A.W. Guy and others, released in 1975 by the DIA, reported on experiments to determine the particular s of the phenomenon of audible electromagnetics, and its rel ation to such things as pulse power, pulse shape, and freque ncy. Along with a number of details about the nature of electr omagnetic interaction with humans and animals, Guy explained why the 220"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"microwaves were audible: microscopic thermal expans ion of brain tissues. Guy had even experimented with sendi ng Morse code via microwaves. Also reported on were Soviet capabilities: \"Sounds and possibly even words which appear to be originating intercranially can be induced by signal modulations at very low power densities.\" Dr. Robert O. Becker, in The Body Electric, comment ed on the technology: \"Such a device has obvious applicat ions in covert operations designed to drive a target crazy with 'v oices' or deliver undetected instructions to a programmed ass assin.\" As with many other instances of claimed mind contro l, separating subjects experiencing hallucinatory voic es from those broadcast electronically is a difficult task. One p ossible solution is suggested by Judy Wall, in her article \"Syntheti c Telepathy,\" published in 1996. Wall proposes that the effect of microwave voices could be detected with an electroencephalogr aph (EEG) machine. The main drawback to this technique is tha t if what- ever agency was broadcasting the messages was aware of the use of monitoring equipment, the messages would undoubt edly stop. As Wall states, \"While it is not a perfect solution , it is hopefully a start towards monitoring, validating, and correctin g the problem of involuntary mind control experimentation and har assment of innocent victims.\" NOTES: 1.

Now the voice that had plagued Ko ski identified itself, saying that it was a spokesman f or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and stating that Koski had been chosen to be a spy. The hospital would be where a p ortion of Koski's training would take place. During the perio d that Koski was in the hospital, he was constantly communicated to through the intercranial voice, told not to take medication , and ordered where to go and where not to go in the hospital. Substantiating Koski's claims is the information th at while in the hospital he was subjected to bizarre \"testing\" by the doctors, including electrical shock to his penis. E very time he would try to go to sleep, he would be jolted by sev ere headaches. Koski may have been the victim of the kind of \"depa tterning\" that Ewen Cameron had conducted 30 years previously in Canada. After Koski left the hospital, there was no abateme nt in the voices in his head, that had begun to call him the \"Microwave Man.\" This is a telling detail, since microwave tra nsmission would be the precise manner in which Koski would ha ve been controlled if his implant was genuine, and it is no t probable that he would have been aware of this, given only a laym an's meager understanding of the techniques of mind control. Koski relates that he was given meaningless assignm ents to perform, such as finding out the population of Toro nto, broken down into the number of men and women. At one point , Koski believes that toxic gas was pumped into his apartme nt. Hoping to escape his harassment, Koski returned to Finland , but the voices did not stop. Now the content of the message s changed, with the voices identifying themselves as being fro m the star Sirius. Again, a telling detail (taken from Freemas onic lore) that is repeated again and again among mind control vict ims and alleged UFO contactees. Koski returned to Canada, s till plagued by the voices and unable to sleep. At home in Edmonton, Koski believes that he was gas sed, and was subjected to elaborate \"psychodrama\" style expe riments. Determining that his believed microwave bombardment was lessened in the open air, Koski was able to get sle ep, and to experience a lessening of the voices. Koski wonders, \"Is there something special about me that singles me out for this kind of attack, or is it si mply that \"They\" are out to get me?

I believe the preparation time, in my cas e four years, is designed to reinforce this isolation, to promote \"strange\" behavior which further discourages friendships or c ontacts.\" This parallels the rationale behind Dr. Cameron's u sage of immigrants in his own mind control experiments in C anada in the 1950s. [1] —Journalist Edward Kelly worked for an alternative news agency in Sweden in the mid-1980s. Part of his work involved investigating patients used in medical experimentat ion by Swedish hospitals. Kelly seems to have run afoul of the government when he contacted the Socialstyrelsen [B oard of Health and Welfare] and other appendages of the sta te, trying to obtain records of hospital experimentation, and in letting them know the kind of research he was conducting. Within a week he became bedridden with an undefined sickness that le ft him unable to walk. More than that, there were strange indications that the sickness was not of natural origin. Papers that had been taped or stapled to his walls rolled up or fell off the walls. When visitors would spend time with Kelly, they also wou ld become sick. The house cat, who had always favored Kelly's bed, would now not even enter the bedroom. Kelly was diagnosed with lumbago, but the illness worsened. Taken to the hos pital, he was diagnosed with cancer. He died on the 28th of M ay 1985, at Karolinska Hospital.

Fratus, in a letter dated October 18, 1988, said that after 11 months in the prison he \"ran afoul of prison officials as a result of a min or altercation with other inmates and what was then deemed to be a poor attitude on my part.\" Among other repercussions, ac cording to Fratus, was that his food was tampered with, he was threatened with carcinogens and disease organisms, and was tol d that his parents would be murdered if he didn't remain silen t about his treatment in prison. Fratus was put in solitary confinement. \"Once isola ted,\" he reports, \"some extremely peculiar things began to o ccur. I became disoriented to the extent that my cell and s urrounding area would take on a surrealistic appearance as tho ugh I were under the influence of a hallucinogenic drug, and I was plagued by severe headaches and insomnia for weeks at a tim e. I had absolutely no inkling what was happening, and after a couple months of having some fantastically cruel games pla yed with my mind ultimately reducing me to a state of anxiety, the psychiatric squad was called in to play their roles in this colossal 'set up' and I was declared to be suffering from a mental illness after undergoing a farcical and cursory interview i n duration of no more than 15 minutes. Delusional persecution and paranoia was, I believe, how they so conveniently labeled me . It was obviously a deliberate and prearranged plan, and th roughout these actions the staff would make malicious commen ts as to, 'How are you enjoying your headaches?', 'Need some aspirin?', and, 'Are you sleeping well, Mr. Fratus?'\" Fratus indicates, \"I began to receive, or hear, hig h frequency tones in my ears. Like the test pattern on a TV set . The volume or intensity of frequencies is adjustable and some are so high and piercing that they've literally had me climbing the walls. When I plug my ears with cotton or fingertips, the tones are still inside and become amplified. It's as if they had be come electrified echo chambers with the sounds coming fr om the inside out. When I complained or acted out, I was b eaten and thrown into a strip cell with no clothes, mattress, toilet paper or drinking water. Nothing—and the intensity of the se frequency transmissions would be crescendoed to mad dening levels. Much mental distress! This is still being d one to me three shifts, 24 hours a day, and the combination o f these demoralizing mental torments and sleep deprivation for weeks on end has exacted a heavy toll on me.\" Fratus describes inner torment so fine-tuned as to be unbelievable, but in terms that makes one wonder: \"They are 227"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"going into my subconscious, or memory bank, bringin g forth unpleasant memories long forgotten, and I am being punished for past as well as present indiscretions.

He says it is \"jok ingly referred to as the 'Death Ray' by guards, and is so potent it causes an intense physical sensation of having an e lectrical, or magnetic force field combined with a vibrating tuni ng fork in my head. Different parts of my brain are targeted by t his thing, causing a variety of mental and physical reactions. Sometimes I can feel it at the base of my brain where it joins the spinal cord, other times up in the frontal lobes, and it is in f act comparable to a lobotomy, as it causes my brain to lock up and malfunction to where I cannot concentrate or spell simple words ... They have, at times, assailed me with this 'Death Ray' i n bursts ranging from seconds to minutes, causing me to psyc hologically bounce up and down like a human yo-yo.\" Perhaps there is a lack of proof of what David Frat us has said. But given our knowledge of mind control technology, there is reason to believe the man's account.

A friend attended this class and br ought a guest. The guest whom I will call 'C.L.' and I became frie nds later. Through these people I got to know some other new acquaintances and whether these people are incident al to, or pivotal figures in what later transpired is somethi ng that can only be speculated about. However, a certain patter n would appear to emerge from this. \"One of the persons I got to know casually was Pegg y Woolsey who had worked as secretary to Richard Helms, forme r head of the CIA in Iran (He was there during the coup). Peg gy would often tell me about her life in Iran. Once when I w as in her apartment having a drink I discovered at least an i nch of sediment on the bottom of my drink.

In fact, I was at th at time so naive I had not realized there was a Russian embass y in West Berlin. I had crossed the border previously primari ly to go to the opera or theater or to buy books (German litera ture classics in cheap editions). I had the impression that somet hing strange was transpiring. It was during this time that I was on three occasions, at three different locations, talked to during my sleep by people I was acquainted with. On these occasions I had awakened abruptly during my sleep and became aware of what was transpiring. I went to the U.S. Consulate and n amed names. After this I was harassed by a man in a white car w ho would drive by my apartment and when in close proximity, would zap me with an electrical field of some sort. He was ve ry brazen. I would find my body pulsating during my sleep especi ally at the base of my spine, but my whole body would vibrate a s well and I would see flashing lights on my wall. I had to go t o the U.S. Consulate several times and they expressed disbelie f in what I was saying, rudely stating: Who would be interested in you—you have no important political or military contacts.

At other times every time I made a decision, drew a conclusion from something, or foll owed instructions it was reinforced.

L earning this took me from fright to near psychosis because of their constant attack and my mind not accepting the unacc eptable truth... \"As the days/weeks/months/years went by at an accel erated rate due to the traumatic stress, I did seek an ans wer by getting an x-ray of my head (I suspected some kind of devic e had been implanted in me because I had been to a dentist for an extraction just prior to the invasion). Also the ni ght prior I was driving back from Van Nuys [California], (being sev erely tortured by the voices) when I stopped for a light, I looked at the car next to me and the man had his head tilted up and w as pointing to a spot in his neck which later turned out to be the exact location of the object. Who this was, I will never know. I got the x-ray from a general practice doctor claiming that I felt pain in my throat and wanted to see if everything was OK. T he x-ray showed a small metal object below my jaw directly u nder where my tooth was extracted. I asked the doctor if it co uld have accidentally fallen there due to the procedure, he replied that it was nearly impossible because it was located below the jaw in the soft tissue of my neck and it would require dri lling through the jaw bone.

Now the means for influencing and controlling entire populations is in the hands of t he ruling elite. In 1972, Dr. Gordon J.F. McDonald gave testimony be fore the House Subcommittee on Oceans and International Envi ronment on the issue of electromagnetic weapons used for mi nd control and mental disruption. McDonald stated, \"The basic notion was to create, between the electrically charged ionosph ere in the higher part of the atmosphere and conducting layers of the surface of the Earth, this neutral cavity, to creat e waves, electrical waves that would be tuned to the brainwa ves... about ten cycles per second... you can produce changes in behavioral patterns or in responses.\" In the late 1970s electromagnetic weapons came into their own, and the proof of this may be the sudden drop i n ozone levels reported internationally. On February 24, 19 87, the PBS- TV network show NOVA announced that a hole had been discovered in the ozone layer above the Antarctic. According to the NOVA commentator, \"Antarctica—the coldest place on Earth. Here a mysterious change has been detected i n a vital element in the atmosphere. This invisible layer 15 miles high acts as a sunscreen around the Earth—our only prote ction from it. \"Scientists warn that ozone depletion\" could cause \"major effects on human health, including: higher incidenc e of skin cancer, cataracts, and depression of the immune sys tem. Losses of ozone would affect climate, damage the growth of plants and disturb the food chain.\" The cause of the depletion of ozone, according to t he mainstream media, was the release of chlorofluoroca rbon (CFC) gases into the atmosphere of the type used in refri gerators, solvents, air conditioning, and insulation, but in September, 1987, Omni magazine may have offered a clue to the real culprit. 239"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"According to that magazine, \"An obscure group of sc ientists, working for the British Antarctic Survey, stumbled upon the ozone hole. Joseph Farman, leader of the group... n oticed a sharp decrease in column-ozone every September and October, starting in 1977...\" These dates for the sudden depletion in ozone level s were confirmed by the February 16, 1986, edition of the Sunday Oklahoman, which stated: \"The ominous thing about t he ozone drop is the rapidity with which it is developing. U ntil about 1977, there was no indication it had changed by any substantial amount since the late 1950s. But it has really fall en off the table in the past few years.\" The Washington Post for July 29, 1987, quoted Rober t Watson, employed by NASA, as saying that until rece ntly scientists were \"worried that a 5 percent change [i n ozone levels] over the next century could be adverse. Ins tead of 5 percent, we're looking at 50 percent in only 10 yea rs... This was absolutely unexpected; it's caught our attentio n.' Three months later the Washington Post was reportin g a drop in ozone levels up to 97% at some locations ov er the Antarctic, drops in ozone over the United States, a nd a drifting ozone hole that passed over the eastern U.S. Noted were outbreaks of 'solar retinitis,' or sunburnt eyes in the eastern United States, as well as an 83% increase in cases of skin cancer in the U.S. [1] What had caused the reported sudden depletion in oz one levels? Although there has been nary a hint of it i n the mainstream press, there are strong indications—incl uding a precise time correlation with the discovery of the ozone holes—that it was electromagnetic bombardment of th e atmosphere. The Soviets have long been interested in the work o f Nikola Tesla, and on July 4, 1976, that interest paid off. The Soviets fired up seven Tesla magnifying transmitters locate d at Chernobyl, beaming 10 herz of energy into the ionos ophere and creating an energetic standing wave that stretched from Chile to Alaska. At the same time, three Soviet satellites c oordinated this irradiation of the upper atmosphere. These sig nals were detected all over the world, and were known as the \"Russian Woodpecker\" due to the chattering interference they produced on radio receivers. [2] Describing the effects of the Tesla magnifying tran smitter, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Bearden, lecturing at a s ymposium of the U.S. Psychotronics Association in 1981, said, \"Tesla found 240"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"that he could set up standing waves... in the earth (the molten core of the earth), or, just set it up through the rocks—the telluric activity in the rocks would furnish activi ty into these waves and one would get more potential energy in th ose waves than he put in. He called the concept the magnifyin g transmitter.\" Bearden stated of the Tesla transmitters, \"They wil l go through anything. What you do is that you set up a standing wave through the earth and the molten core of the earth begins to feed that wave (we are talking Tesla now). When you have that standing wave, you have set up a triode. What you'v e done is that the molten core of the earth is feeding the energy and it's like your signal—that you are putting in—is gating the g rid of a triode... Then what you do is that you change the f requency. If you change the frequency one way (start to dephase it) you dump the energy up in the atmosphere beyond the point on the other side of the earth that you focused upon. You start ionizing the air, you can change the weather flow patterns (jet streams, etc.)—you can change all of that—if you dump it gra dually, real gradually—you influence the heck out of the weather . It's a great weather machine. If you dump it sharply, you don't get a little ionization like that. You will get flashes and fire balls (plasma) that will come down on the surfaces of the earth... you can cause enormous weather changes over entire regions by pla ying that thing back and forth.\" Weather changes and more. According to a United Press International report of December 22, 1977, \"a series of mysterious atmosphe ric explosions were reported along the New Jersey shore last night for the third time this month... Police said the ex plosions were preceded by a series of rumblings. On December 2, t here were two similar incidents, but the Federal Aviation Adm inistration, the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Nuclear Regulat ory Commission have been unable to offer any explanatio n for the blasts.\" Other effects have been attributed to the Russian Woodpeckers by Dr. Andrija Puharich, in a research paper titled Global Magnetic Warfare. Puharich stated that contr olled earthquakes could be set off by the Russians using this technology, and that, \"Of the many great earthquake s of 1976, there is one that demands special attention—the Jul y 28, 1976 Tangshan, China earthquake.\" Tangshan was devastate d with 650,000 persons dead. Almost a year later, the New York Times, on June 5, 1977, 241"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"recounted curious precursor events to the Tangshan quake, stating that, \"just before the first tremor at 3:42 AM, the sky lit up 'like daylight.' The multi-hued lights, mainly w hite and red, were seen up to 200 miles away. Leaves on many tree s were burned to a crisp and growing vegetables were scorc hed on one side, as if by a fireball.\" In 1978, Dr. Robert Beck reported on ELF fields rel ated to mood alterations in Canadians. Beck and another res earcher, William Bise, noted changes in the behavior and bra in wave patterns of persons in the Pacific Northwest, attri buting them to the Russian Woodpecker broadcasts. In 1984, Thomas Bearden delivered another talk enti tled \"Soviet Weather Warfare Over North America.\" Bearde n noted the existence of hitherto-unseen weather patterns a nd cloud formations in North America since the Russian Woodp eckers had gone into operation. These, he maintained, were the signature of the Tesla magnifying transmitter. One cloud pattern that Bearden mentioned was a \"giant radial, \" resembling the Japanese \"rising sun\" symbol with rays radiatin g out of a central circle. Bearden expanded on the capabilities of the Russian Woodpeckers, the technology employing electromagnet ic waves of pure potential: \"By interfering two beams of suc h scalar waves at a distance, a scalar interferometer is produced. By slow rotation of the transmitter, the entire distant int erference zones—and the highs and lows—can be moved along. Th is scheme then allows the capturing and movement of hi gh cloud masses, direct manipulation of high and low pressur e areas, diversion of jet streams, and extensive Soviet cont rol over the weather patterns of North America.\" [3] By the 1970s the Americans were struggling to come into parity with the Russians in terms of the new techno logy. Concerned with advances in Russian technology, in t he 1970s the Americans launched Project Nile Blue, later ren amed Climate Dynamics. Reportedly as part of a secret Soviet/U.S. Polar wa rming pact, the Americans began to broadcast their own ELF sign als at 30 Hertz. Signals broadcast at 30 Hertz are reportedly far less dangerous than the Soviet 10 Hertz signals, which h ave been speculated to cause weakened immune systems, effect s on mood and cognitive processes, and increased vulnerabilit y to a host of diseases, some of them newly manufactured in labora tories. According to the P.A.C.E. Newsletter, \"ELF fields u sually propagate vertically to the ground, creating 'Sta nding Waves' 242"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"that tend to go down towards the Earth's core and u p to the various strata of the biosphere. Like their ultravi olet photon counterparts from the sun, they can redistribute en ergy and momentum in the [atmospheric] troposphere through c umulus convection. It has been suggested ELF-induced charges in the io n electrical effects perturb the electric current and field patterns of the field circuit of the atmosphere, a field who se existence is established by 'classical' thunderstorm activity th eory. It is known that the microphysics of the surface level at mosphere and other strata are dependent on atmospheric elect ric state.\" [4] A story in the New York Times for December 16, 1980 , alluded to American ELF transmissions: \"Scientists in Antarctica believe they have probably created an aurora over Q uebec. The aurora should have resulted from an experiment cond ucted... to interfere with the earth's magnetic field lines tha t extend from Antarctica to Canada. Electrons forming the earth-e ncircling radiation belt normally are trapped in paths that s piral around the magnetic field lines and reverse direction as t hey near the earth at each end of the magnetic arc. If their pat hs are perturbed by radio waves, they fail to reverse and plunge into the atmosphere. \"When specific radio frequencies are transmitted, t heir effects (which can include electron showers, pertur bations of the earth's magnetism and disturbances in the radio -reflecting layers of the upper atmosphere) should all oscillat e at a tempo matching that of the transmitted signal.\" [5] The Washington Times of February 4, 1986, noted the existence of ELF generators located in Norway and A laska, and said that scientists in Alaska \"manipulate and orch estrate aurora displays by beaming powerful radio waves up from th e ground. Recent tests have also indicated that a related phe nomenon, the polar electrojet, a 'river of electricity flowing t hrough the upper atmosphere,' may have a practical application.\" [6] At the same time, apparent cover stories were issue d, such as a report in the Washington Post that said, \"Powerfu l radio waves, generated by navigational beacons on earth are caus ing 'Electron Rain' to fall into the earth's upper atmosphere fro m the Van Allen radiation belts thousands of miles out in spa ce, a team of researchers from four universities has found.\" [7] When the satellite Ginga, or Galaxy, was launched b y the Japanese in February 1987 it was described as a mis sion to detect X-ray emissions from the stars. But, as is often the case 243"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"in space research, it had another purpose: to detec t radiation from Chinese and Russian underground nuclear weapon s testing. One of the concerns of the Japanese was that atmosp heric currents would carry radiation leakage from Central Asia directly across the airstream of Japan. In June Ginga detected massive gamma ray bursts and , contacting NASA, the Japanese were informed that th e probable source of the radiation was the Russian Kosmos 1900 satellite, supposedly used for oceanic observation. Further te sting confirmed that the radiation was coming from the Ko smos 1900. [8] This Russian satellite and others were being used i n a program run by Sergei Korolev, the \"father\" of the Sputnik, in the radioactive \"seeding\" of the Van Allen upper at mospheric belts. Satellites carrying nuclear reactors would f ire pulses of electromagnetic energy into the ionosphere. The pur pose of Kosmos 1900 was the creation of an electromagnetic \"mirror\" for the reflection of Russian-originated ELF beams. On October 1, 1996, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin on a visit to Tokyo announced that Russia w ould participate with Japan in the creation of a joint m issile defense system. Boris Yeltsin had earlier proposed a joint defense system to the Americans. The overall plan was, in f act, a tripartite defense system aimed at countering the C hinese threat. [9] There are many curious phenomena taking place in th e world today, suggesting that advanced electronic weapons such as those discussed above are in operation. As an examp le, in 1985 a number of arson specialists investigating the lar ge number of forest fires that were taking place in central Cali fornia came to the conclusion that the fires had started high in t he trees. At the time of the fires there had been no reports of lightning. Is it possible that this was an example of the testing of space-based Star Wars-style weaponry?

Mr. Eastlund assign ed the patent rights to APTI, Inc., a Los Angeles subsidia ry of Atlantic Richfield.\" The patent said that the technology is able to: \"Cause... total disruption of communications over a very large portion of the Earth... disrupting not only land-ba sed communications, but also airborne communications an d sea communications (both surface and subsurface)... mis sile or aircraft destruction, deflection, or confusion... w eather modification... by altering solar absorption...

Eastlund was interviewed on the radio show, and sai d, \"I am not happy, personally, that the patent was issued p ublicly.

Specific discussi on of military 247"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"applications is secret—proprietary also. It's what they wanted to do.\" [1] The first apparent usage of the technology of paten t 4,686,605 was HAARP, the High-frequency Active Auro ral Research Program, run by the Department of Defense, the Air Force's Phillips Laboratory, and the Office of Nava l Research. Although the military has denied that the patent is related to HAARP, Eastlund's responses put the obvious lie to that. HAARP is a huge electromagnetic broadcasting facili ty located in Gakona, Alaska, on the site of an abandoned over -the-horizon radar installation. Covering 58 acres, the complex consists of 360 high frequency antennae towers aimed at the sky . The cost of the project is between $25 million and $30 milli on. The official description of the project is \"a major Arc tic facility for upper atmospheric and solar-terrestrial research.\" Here is a quote from Eastlund's patent: \"In the past several years, substantial effort has been made to understand and explain the phenomena involved in be lts of trapped electrons and ions, and to explore the poss ible ways to control and use these phenomena for beneficial purp oses. For example, in the late 1950s and the early 1960s both the United States and the USSR detonated a series of nuclear d evices of various yields to generate large numbers of charged particles at various altitudes, e.g., 200 kilometers or greater. .. \"This can cause confusion of or interference with o r even complete disruption of guidance systems employed by even the most sophisticated of airplanes and missiles. The a bility to employ and transmit over very wide areas of the Ear th a plurality of electromagnetic waves of varying frequencies, an d to change same at will in a random manner, provides a unique ability to interfere with all modes of communication, land, se a, and/or air, at the same time. Because of the unique juxtapositi on of usable fuel source at the point where desirable field-line s intersect the Earth's surface, such wide-ranging and complete communication interference can be achieved in a rea sonably short period of time... Thus, this invention provid es the ability to put unprecedented amounts of power in the Earth' s atmosphere at strategic locations and to maintain t he power injection level, particularly if random pulsing is employed, in a manner far more precise and better controlled than heretofore accomplished by the prior art, particularly by the detonation of nuclear devices of various yields at various altitu des... Further, by knowing the frequencies of various electromagnetic beams employed in the practice of this invention, it is p ossible not only 248"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"to interfere with third party communications but to take advantage of one or more such beams to carry out a communications network even though the rest of the world's communications are disrupted. Put another way, what is used to disrupt another's communications can be employed by one knowledgeable of this invention as a communications network at the same time. In addition, once one's own communic ations network is established, the far reaching extent of the effects of this invention could be employed to pick up communi cation signals of others for intelligence purposes... \"This invention has a phenomenal variety of possibl e ramifications and potential future developments. As alluded to earlier, missile or aircraft destruction, deflectio n, or confusion could result, particularly when relativistic partic les are employed. Also, large regions of the atmosphere cou ld be lifted to an unexpectedly high altitude so that missiles e ncounter unexpected and unplanned drag forces with resultant destruction or deflection of same. Weather modifica tion is possible by, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns by constructing one or more plumes of atmo spheric particles which will act as a lens or focusing devi ce. Also as alluded to earlier, molecular modification of the a tmosphere can take place so that positive environmental effects c an be achieved. Besides actually changing the molecular c omposition of an atmospheric region, a particular molecule or molecules can be chosen for increased presence. For example, ozon e, nitrogen, etc., concentrations in the atmosphere co uld be artificially increased. Similarly, environmental en hancement could be achieved by causing the breakup of various chemical entities such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, n itrous oxides, and the like...\" Interestingly enough, perhaps a more complete descr iption of what the HAARP electromagnetic transmission faci lity can do was provided many years ago by The New York Times, for December 8, 1915. The article is also cited in the Eastlund patent. \"Nikola Tesla,\" the article begins, \"the inventor, has filed patent applications on the essential parts of a mac hine, the possibilities of which test a layman's imagination and promise a parallel of Thor's shooting thunderbolts from the s ky to punish those who had angered the gods... Suffice it to say that the invention will go through space with a speed of 300 miles a second, a manless ship without propelling engine or wings, sent by electricity to any desired point on the globe on its errand of 249"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"destruction, if destruction its manipulator wishes to effect. \"'It is not a time,' said Dr. Tesla yesterday, 'to go into the details of this thing. It is founded upon a princip le that means great things in peace; it can be used for great thi ngs in war. But I repeat, this is no time to talk of such things.' \"'It is perfectly practicable to transmit electrica l energy without wires and produce destructive effects at a distance. I have already constructed a wireless transmitter whi ch makes this possible, and have described it in my technica l publications, among which I refer to my patent number 1,119,732, recently granted. With a transmitter of this kind we are ena bled to project electrical energy in any amount to any dist ance and apply it for innumerable purposes, both in war and peace. Through the universal adoption of this system, idea l conditions for the maintenance of law and order will be realiz ed, for then the energy necessary to the enforcement of right an d justice will be normally productive, yet potential, and in any m oment available, for attack and defense. The power transm itted need not be necessarily destructive, for, if distance is made to depend upon it, its withdrawal or supply will bring about the same results as those now accomplished by force of arms. '\" Another article referred to in the patent was also in The New York Times, this time for September 22, 1940. The f ollowing is an excerpt: \"Nikola Tesla, one of the truly great inventors who celebrated his eighty-fourth birthday on July 10, tells the wr iter that he stands ready to divulge to the United States govern ment the secret of his 'teleforce' with which, he said, airp lane motors would be melted at a distance of 250 miles, so that an invisible Chinese Wall of Defense would be built around this country... \"This 'teleforce', he said, is based on an entirely new principle of physics that 'no one has ever dreamed about', different from the principle embodied in his invent ions relating to the transmission of electrical power from a dist ance, for which he has received a number of basic patents. Th is new type of force, Mr. Tesla said, would operate through a b eam one one- hundred-millionth of a square centimeter in diamete r, and could be generated from a special plant that would cost no more than $2,000,000 and would only take three months to construct. \"The beam, he states, involves four new inventions, two of which have already been tested. One of these is a m ethod and apparatus for producing rays 'and other manifestati ons or energy' in free air, eliminating the necessity for a high vacuum; a 250"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"second is a method and process for producing 'very great electrical force'; the third is a method for amplif ying this force; and the fourth is a new method for producing 'a tre mendous electrical repelling force'. This would be the proj ector, or gun, of the system. The voltage for propelling the beam to its objective, according to the inventor, will attain a potential of 50,000,000 volts. \"With this enormous voltage, he said, microscopic e lectrical particles of matter will be catapulted on their mis sion of defensive destruction. He has been working on this invention, he added, for many years and has recently made a nu mber of improvements in it.\" Tesla is apparently talking about the technology em ployed in HAARP. Although the project is unclassified, this may be a ruse, since many of the functions that HAARP is capable of are not mentioned in its brief. The Department of Defense's intention is for us to believe that HAARP is a testing facili ty for ionospheric research, while others critical of the project point out that it is capable of this function and far mor e. One of the apparent, unstated purposes of HAARP is as a Strate gic Defense Initiative (\"Star Wars\") weapons system. Another us age of the technology, verified in many accounts including Eas tlund's original patent of the technology, is weather contr ol. Another capability is mind control. In November 1987, information on an earlier auroral stimulation project was revealed that also highligh ts suppressed capabilities of HAARP. In the magazine Heartland, it was stated, \"The most powerful radio signal in the Fairbanks ar ea is not directed to a listening audience in interior Alaska . The U.S. government's China Hot Springs station is titled 'H igh Power Auroral Stimulation Facility.' UCLA operates the si te, drawing researchers from across the country. One of the mai n projects involves a team led by Anthony Ferraro of Penn Stat e University with assistance from the University of Alaska Geoph ysical Institute.\" According to Heartland, in October 1987, Ferraro's team \"successfully tested a theory that heating the iono sphere makes possible the generation and transmission of extreme ly low frequency or ELF radio waves... The technique teste d here involves shining a one million watt high frequency wave into the ionosphere through a very narrow beam, effectively producing 80 million watts of power. 'When that beam shines i nto the ionosphere, it increases the temperature of the re gion by 50 251"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"percent,' Ferraro said. \"The beam heats a large pancake shaped spot, six mi les thick and 12 miles in diameter, in the ionosphere 40 to 6 0 miles above the ground... When the temperature of the ion osphere increases, the current produced by the electrically charged particles in the ionosphere changes and can be regu lated by turning the transmitter on and off. In effect this procedure creates a radio antenna in the ionosphere which emi ts a radio wave that comes back down to earth. The waves are e xtremely low frequency.\" [2] An example of the kind of damage that HAARP is capa ble of comes from another project entirely, an Air Force r adar installation that came on-line in 1979. Located on Cape Cod, the \"Pave Paws\" transmitter broadcast only 1/1000th of the electromagnetic energy of HAARP, but its effects we re still deadly. Within two years, women living in nearby to wns began developing leukemia at a rate 23% higher than the s tate norm, and various forms of cancer at a rate 69% higher th an other women in Massachusetts. [3] Perhaps the most important possible use of HAARP, especially in the context of this book, is mind con trol and disruption, although this capability is naturally n ever brought up in the official literature. HAARP broadcasts at the same frequencies as those of the human brain, and can be attuned for specific applications on entire populations. The te chnology also could conceivably be used for projecting words and images directly to the minds of entire populations.

The sound is described as persistent and maddening, as irritating as the screech of fingernails on a blackboard. In Taos, New Mexico, \"the Hum\" has been going on si nce 1991. \"It sounds like a great, big American car eng ine that's on idle,\" said Steven Walters. \"When I first heard it, I thought I was going crazy.\" K.C. Grams, an area resident, says the sound can ge t so loud that \"my head buzzes, as if it were a beehive.\" Schatzie Hubbell moved from Santa Fe, New Mexico, w here she was plagued by the sound, to Fort Worth, Texas. \"After living there for 32 years and being very involved i n the community, we had to leave,\" she said. \"It's like a Chinese torture treatment. It affects you at a level you ca n't get to. Extreme irritation. Fingers across the chalkboard .\" James Kelly, director of research on hearing at the University of New Mexico says, \"We now have two large populati ons who hear these hums, here and in England. The people in Taos are deeply disturbed by this. This is not trivial.\" The noise is said to be incredibly annoying, and wi ll not stop unless you overwhelm it by playing the stereo or te levision loudly, or doing something else to drown it out. \"The Hum\" may have been even recorded by a Denver, Colorado, acoustical engineer, between 17 and 70 cy cles per second, roughly the same audio level as distant thu nder. This study has been confirmed by a survey of people who have heard the sound who, when it is simulated, place the freq uency at between 33 and 80 cycles per second—results similar to those 253"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"conducted on people in Great Britain who have been hearing the same kind of sound. [1] Hueytown, Alabama, near Birmingham, has since Decem ber 1991—near the same time period the sound was first widely heard in Taos—been the recipient of the \"Hueytown H um.\" According to residents a sound reminiscent of a den tist's drill or a humming fluorescent light is sporadically hear d, sometimes radiating from the ground and other times coming fr om the air. One particular area of approximately 500 homes seem s to be particularly affected by the sound. [2] Another report comes from New Zealand, and was publ ished in Would You Believe magazine. Fred and Phyll Dicke nson relate, \"What you call \"the Hum\" is called \"the Noise\" in o ur country... New Zealand. It still continues here, too, some nig hts it is more predominant than others—possibly because it is quie ter at night but it can still be heard in the daytime. \"It is strange but once one has heard it, it's neve r forgotten. Yet it takes a lot of people quite a time to kind o f tune into it. \"Another peculiar thing about it is... younger peop le cannot hear it or rather 'tune into it', it appears 'older ears' are more inclined to pick it up. \"In some of our travels in the countryside, if ther e is a quiet spot along the road, especially in quiet country an d in road cuttings with high banks or hills on either side, t he 'noise' seems to be amplified. \"We noticed this once when we got out of the car to look at some rocks in a cutting, and were immediately struc k with the intensity of the hum and we looked around for possi ble electric power lines which could possibly be the cause, but none were in sight. We were actually in wide open country with n o power lines for miles. \"When I was working and coming home in the early ho urs of the morning I used to sit in the car when I reached the carpost and with windows closed would listen to this loud h um. The closed car confines seemed to amplify the noise. Ge tting out of the car it could still be heard, and just standing there, turning round to all points of the compass, the noise was s till heard, in other words it had no fixed point of origin. \"I hasten to mention here it was NO internal head n oise but was definitely coming in from outside the body. Som e people pass it off as blood noises in a person's head but it is not that.\" [3] A federal task force of scientists from the Univers ity of New Mexico, the U.S. Air Force, and Sandia and Los Alam os National 254"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Laboratories was formed to investigate the phenomen on in Taos, New Mexico, but predictably they found nothing. The ir speculations tend towards the sounds originating in the ear itself, and the motion of Earth's tectonic plates. My guess is they know exactly what is causing the sound. The once-skeptical Rep. Bill Richardson, of the Hou se Intelligence Committee, knows that \"the Hum\" is not delusion. He told a meeting in Taos that the sound is \"defens e related\" and requested that the Pentagon \"shut it down.\" Another investigator, Bob Saltzman, talks about a s cientist on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee l osing his job over his claims that the Department of Defense was responsible for the hum. He also reports that Rep. Richardson has since backed off of his investigation and won't return his phone calls. [4] Perhaps significantly, some people are not running away from \"the Hum,\" but are relocating closer to it. Since t he early 1990s, in Taos, dozens of people have moved to the area specifically to be in the vicinity of \"the Hum.\" On e woman says that she moved to Taos, and the anomalous sound aft er seeing a UFO. \"I knew it couldn't possibly be an airplane,\" she said. \"It came closer... then a very tired feeling overcame m e. I felt compelled to lie down on the bed. What's more I fel t a weight right over my chest, pushing me down.\" She fell asl eep, but then, \"When I was asleep, I had the strangest dream , one that recurs every now and then. Something closely resemb ling a cash register tape kept running upwards. I kept see ing rows and rows of green numbers. After a long time, the n umbers started changing color. They became green on top an d orange on the bottom. The running tape on the second set o f numbers didn't run very long. When the numerical action sto pped and I thought the experience was over, then some more num bers started coming up. These were orange. This experien ce seemed quite lengthy, just like the one with the gr een numbers. When the numbers quit registering in my mind, I wan ted to get up, but again I was powerless to do so.\" The woman awoke, feeling disoriented. \"I tried to s ee the flying craft, but the sky looked like a blur to me. \" For days after she felt a \"strange numbness. It felt like I was ex periencing a brain rape. That's pretty strange for me, because I have a [literal] mind and I'm not that fond of numbers.\" [ 5] Other incidents suggesting the testing of advanced electromagnetic or other weapons are the literally hundreds of unusual fireballs—usually green or orange-red—and o ther strange 255"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"aerial phenomena that have been observed worldwide in recent years. Although I have records of sightings of simi lar fireballs from around the world, due to space limitations I w ill confine myself to recent sightings in Australia: On May 28, 1993, a huge orange-red fireball with a bluish tail flew at the speed of a fast jet plane from the sout h to the north between Leonora and Laverton, Australia. Its flight was observed over an area of 250 kilometers. The fireball made a \"pulsed roaring noise, similar to a very loud train.\" Immed iately after the passage of the fireball a 3.9 Richter-scale ear thquake struck in the area, with an enormous drawn-out blast being heard afterward. An engineer with explosives experience d escribed the event as \"definitely a major explosive concussi on wave blast, similar to, but much bigger than, a normal open-pit mine blast.\" It is notable that this area of Australia has not h ad any other recorded earthquakes since it first began to be sei smically monitored in 1900. At the presumed impact site of the fireball—no impa ct crater was ever found—an enormous deep red hemisphere of l ight, surrounded by a silver layer of light, rose into th e air and was observed by viewers as far as 50 kilometers away. A ccording to a witness, it \"bobbed around a bit for nearly two hou rs before disappearing suddenly—as if someone threw the light switch off.\" About one hour after the fireball impact, ano ther smaller blue-green-white fireball rose from the ground and flew over the area. Another smaller explosion and slight earthqua ke were noted at the time. Another fireball was observed in the same area in \" May or June\" of 1993, a yellow-orange-red \"Moon-sized\" obj ect, flying from south to north at low level. In October 1994, at the mining town of Tom Price in Western Australia, a huge pulsing red-orange fireba ll without a tail was observed slowly traveling overhead at a lo w altitude, perhaps 200 to 300 meters. Approximately 2,000 peop le observed the overflight of the fireball, and some w itnesses describe the red flames swirling in a spiral patter n that disappeared into a \"central black hole\" in the burn ing mass. One witness called it an \"implosion ball of flames. \" The fireball was visible for five to seven minutes and went from the west to hills in the east. Then the fireball flashed a vivi d blue-white, illuminating the surrounding area, and shot off at a rapid speed to disappear in the east. Immediately after the appearance of the fireball, a second fireball came out of the west, following the path of the first. 256"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Aside from the fact that it was traveling at a lowe r altitude, the fireball is described as being identical to the fir st. This fireball also traveled to the east and disappeared in a blue -white flash. A third fireball duplicated the appearance and traj ectory of the first two, and also disappeared in a blue-white flash. On May 1, 1995, at 2 a.m., a large orange-red fireb all, with a blue-white tail, was seen above Perth, Australia, t raveling at a north-northeast trajectory. Again, the fireball sou nded like a roaring freight train, and flew at about the speed of a fast jet aircraft. Remarkably, as it traveled over east Pert h, the fireball halted in its path, and the tail reversed its direc tion. Then the fireball exploded, lighting up the city. According to researcher and mining geologist Harry Mason, \"In many ways the event was similar in force level to a nuclear blast. A loud, vibrating, massive explosion-cum-sei smic wave reverberated around Perth, causing the city buildin gs to shake and books and objects to fall off shelves.\" About h alf the population of the city was awoken by the explosion. Some observers of the event reported that four whit e lights shot out from the center of the fireball and formed a \"right- angled white cross in the sky.\" Although the event was estimated to have exploded with the force of severa l megatons of dynamite, the event was not covered in the world pr ess. The same night as the Perth fireball, almost 2,000 miles to the north, a couple in their home in the Kimberley region of Western Australia were woken around 3 a.m. by a roa ring noise \"similar to a D9 bulldozer or tank engine.\" Books a nd other items fell from shelves, with an apparent earthquak e taking place for one to two minutes. Retracing the trajectory of the Perth fireball, one comes to the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia, the area where the KAL 007 was downed. Noted in the book KAL 007 is the inform ation that the plane may have been attempting to gain informat ion on an electromagnetic weapons complex located on the peninsula—and this complex may be the source of Aus tralia's fireballs. [6] Since the May, 1993 fireball and earthquakes, there have been more than 1,000 reports in Australia of fireba lls and strange light phenomena, as well as large numbers o f similar events worldwide. Many of the fireballs are reporte d to have made the same \"freight train\" sounds as they passed . It is significant to note that residents who witnes sed the Tom Price fireballs noted that they had come from the d irection of an American \"Very Low Frequency submarine communicatio n base\" 257"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"at Exmouth Peninsula, a location supposedly turned over to the Australian Navy by the U.S., but where there are st ill a number of American technicians resident. The Exmouth Peninsula site consists of a power stat ion and \"Tower Zero,\" a high box-like aerial tower on a hil ltop with 11 equally spaced smaller towers—each about 1,000 feel tall—arrayed around it. The towers are connected by wire forming three concentric circles. Inside of Tower Z ero is an elevator that runs to the top of the tower. Entering the tunnel that goes into the hillside at Tower Zero one finds an at least three-story underground base, with a 50 foot high by 15-foot diameter copper coil. The cove r story is that the Exmouth site is transmitting very low freq uency (VLF) or extremely low frequency (ELF) radio messages to submarines, but an examination of the facility reveals that it is a Tesla Magnifying Energy Transmitter, that is, a Tesla ele ctromagnetic weapons system. Another aspect of these events are huge blue-white light flashes of the type seen at Rocky Gully, Western Au stralia, in 1996. According to Australian researcher Harry Maso n, \"blue- white streamers of arcing electricity issued from t he forest floor into the atmosphere, creating an intense, violent, blue-white glow (and an attendant 'electrical noise') that was visible for miles—'like someone with a giant arc welder'. This event persisted for at least several minutes. The observe rs fled the area in fear for their lives, phased out by the app arently enormous energy involved in the event.\" According to Mason, \"These massive energy bursts of high- altitude, blue-white and/or ground level electrical arcs are reasonably common and I have about 100 such documen ted events\" listed in his database. These may be the same high energy bursts that have been seen by pilots in clear skies, and detected by the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory satellite, launched in 1991 b y the space shuttle, and the ALEXIS spy satellite. These satell ites have detected radio and gamma ray bursts about 100,000 f eet above the Earth, seen most frequently over Africa and Sou th America. The scientists running these programs have not said much about the phenomena, \"the likes of which are not describe d in the scientific literature.\" [7] Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Tom Bearden ta lked about similar phenomena in 1985. He said, \"There ha ve been a series of tests of these kinds of [electromagnetic] weapons, apparently for a number of years. For example, ai rliners from 258"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Iran, before the fall of the Shah, saw deep within the Soviet Union very large, glowing spherical balls of light which started out small and then expanded to very large size, whi ch are apparently these kind of weapons for use in an anti -ballistic missile defense role.\" Bearden also stated, \"...You can create, for exampl e, either an electromagnetic explosion at a distance, or you can create an electromagnetic implosion at a distance... This wou ld look like a cold explosion, so to speak, and I believe the thin g on April the 9th, 1984, off the coast of Japan that involved sev eral 747 jet airliners [is an example of this].\" 747 Pilot Doug Happ was a witness of this event, in which a huge cloud was seen rising from an overcast area be low. Happ said, \"It looked like a plate coming up through the overcast, but it just kept expanding, and as it got higher it was apparent that you could see right through the middle of it, so it looked like a big smoke ring. At the time that we first noticed t his cloud we weren't sure what to do and we took no evasive acti on because we didn't know which way to go, and I think eventua lly we either rammed through it or it completely engulfed us.\" When Happ's plane reached its destination, Anchorage, Al aska, it was checked for radioactive contamination. The result o f the tests was negative. [8] Another frequently observed aerial display is of or ange-red vertical beams, reported since about 1985, with at least 100 events reported since that time. Mason reports that, \"One 1996 Brisbane beam event r eport was very significant as the observers saw very high -voltage, blue- white discharge streamers issuing from their house wall- mounted main power box as an orange beam hovered ne arby in the sky. Members of another household reported thei r power box hummed violently as the orange beam hovered som e distance in the sky. \"This data confirms the probability that Tesla-styl e longitudinal scalar EM potentials were involve in t his Brisbane event (and therefore were possibly present during t he other beam events), probably created by a remote Tesla EM transmitter...\" [9] The following radio interview provides additional i nsight on the current state of electromagnetic weaponry, and information on the sorts of advanced weaponry that may have bee n used to generate the Perth fireball and other events of thi s nature.

He's interested in science in general, but was part icularly intrigued by a program last April, in which you, Bo ris, spoke of microwave generator development in Russia. He'd lik e you to return to the subject... First of all, could you ex plain why there is an interest in such generators\"... BORIS BELITSKY: Powerful microwave generators are o f interest, for one thing, because of their possible military applications. They can be used to fire a plasmoid, that is, a blob of plasma... YEKIMENKO: Remind us, Boris, just what is meant by plasma... BELITZKY: Plasma is a mixture of electrons and ions . We have all seen it, for example, in electric arc disc harges and in sparks. It is also a prime factor in thermonuclear reactions, as in the sun. Space scientists in this country have a long record of experimenting with it. For example, plasma engines were tested in some of the early Soviet Mars probes, a q uarter of a century ago. Very extensive studies of plasma have been carried out under the program of research into controlled n uclear fusion. Research into the military applications has been conducted at some of the leading research institute s of the military-industrial complex, for example at the Res earch Institute of Radio Instruments. YEKIMENKO: How would a microwave generator be used in anger, Boris? BELITZKY: It would be used to fire a plasmoid, that is, a blob of plasma into the path of an incoming missile , its warhead, or an aircraft. The plasmoid would effectively ioni ze that region of space and, in this way, disturb the aerodynamics of the flight of the missile, warhead, or aircraft, terminate the ir flight, making such a generator and its plasmoid a practica lly invulnerable weapon, providing protection against a ttack via space or the atmosphere. YEKIMENKO: Boris, I hate to ask this question, but still... The generals and scientists who speak of this weapo n—they couldn't be bluffing, could they? 260"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"BELITZKY: Oh, no. This is evident if only from the fact that a few years ago in 1993, at the Russian-Americ an summit in Vancouver, the Russians proposed a joint experiment in testing such generators—or plasma weapons, as they are call ed here—as an alternative to the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI. In such an experiment, which it was proposed to code name \"Tru st,\" the system would be used to repulse a missile attack. I n this way, Russia hoped to strengthen the new climate of post- Cold War security in the world. YEKIMENKO: Is it known who is the leading scientist behind the development of plasma weapons in Russia? BELITZKY: Yes. It is 65-year-old Rimily Avramenko, a graduate of the Moscow Institute of Power Engineeri ng. In 1955 he started work under Alexander Mints at the r esearch institute headed by that outstanding scientist. The n followed a period of work at the Sary-Shagan Proving Ground, n ot far from Lake Balkhash. It was there that he started work on anti-missile defense systems. He was a leading designer of the g iant \"Don\" radar complex, which some specialists in the West d ubbed the \"Eighth Wonder of the World.\" As for plasma weapons , he has been working in that field since 1967. YEKIMENKO: Was he the first scientist in this count ry to tackle the problem of anti-missile defense? BELITZKY: No. The first was probably the famous Pet er Kapitsa. When Kapitsa was banished in Stalin's time to his country home, he designed a weapons system based on microwave emission. That was in 1953, and he called the system the Nigotron, a contraction based on the nam e of the village where his country home was situated, Nikoli na Gora. Other scientists interested in this possibility wer e Alexander Mints and Lev Artsimovich. These were actually Avra menko's mentors. All of them didn't believe in the effectiv eness of (existing) \"anti-missile\" (technology). They felt a countermissile would not be effective against an in coming missile, protected by a stealth-type coating and a host of decoys. And they began looking for alternative solutions to the problem. They soon concluded that the most vulnerable factor in a missile attack was the media through which the incoming mis siles traveled. And they decided that the best so lution was to 261"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"influence that medium. That was how the idea of u sing powerful microwave generators was born. [10] NOTES: 1.

They are \"soft kill\" weapons, and in public discussions of the topic, developments su ch as nets, rubber bullets, snares, malodorous sprays, aqueous foams that 'befuddle combatants' senses and effectiveness', lu bricants that make walking impossible, and particles that gum up mechanical systems are mentioned. These examples, while great for the fluff purveyed by Time Magazine or Popular Science, carefully do not betray the rationale behind thinking in the \"no n-lethal\" warfare zone. \"Non-lethality\" is not, in fact, a description of a type of weapon, but a way of thinking about warfare. The re al purpose of non-lethality is to more finely tune control, to cr eate a more precise and responsive infrastructure of control on both the battlefield and in everyday society. Interest in non-lethality began with the brainstorm ing of a man named John Alexander. Alexander had been a comm ander of Green Berets in Vietnam, leading Cambodian merce naries, and engaging in secret programs including the infam ous Phoenix assassination operation. After returning to the States and getting a Ph.D. from Walden University, he stud ied the near- death experience with Elisabeth Kubler-Ross and bec ame an official spokesperson for Silva Mind Control. In 1980 Alexander published an article in the U.S. Army's Military Review, titled \"The New Mental Battlefield .\" Far from compounds resembling artificial banana peels to mak e armies slip and slide, Alexander's thesis was that telepat hy could be used as an offensive weapon, and that electronic we apons might also be used for interfering with the brain activit y of target groups. Alexander was encouraged by two senior army officia ls to do 263"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"additional research in the area, and this led to hi s joining the special technologies group at Los Alamos National L aboratories. There Alexander began a collaboration with Janet Mo rris, also a grad of Silva, and Research Director of the U.S. Gl obal Strategy Council think tank, whose chairman is Ray Cline, fo rmer Deputy Director of the CIA. The USGSC's lobbying was respo nsible for the creation of the Non-lethality Policy Review Gro up, led by Major General Chris S. Adams, USAF (retd.), former Chief of Staff, Strategic Air Command. This group has encour aged the military to think in terms of non-lethality. In 1991 Janet Morris issued several papers promotin g the concept of non-lethality, suggesting an escalation in certain key areas of military research and production. These in cluded technologies directed at the destruction of weapons of war, but also an increased focus on anti-personnel electroma gnetics. This latter category of weapons would include hand- held lasers for blinding the enemy, \"isotropic radiators\", esse ntially a larger scale laser for blinding the enemy that was reporte dly used during the Iraqi war, infrasound weapons, and very low frequency weapons. Morris, in her \"In Search of a Non-Lethal Strategy\" states, \"Some very low frequency sound generators, in certa in frequency ranges, can cause the disruption of human organs and, at high power levels, can crumble masonry.\" Another take is provided by the Strategic Studies I nstitute (SSI) of the U.S. Army War College, in Pennsylvania . The 1994 paper \"The Revolution in Military Affairs and Confl ict Short of War\" posits thay \"Many American strategic thinkers believe that we are in the beginning stages of a historical revo lution in military affairs.\" They even give it an acronym: RM A. \"This will not only change the nature of warfare, but also alt er the global geopolitical balance.\" According to the RMA manifesto there are a number o f new avenues of warfare research that should be pursued, specifically \"behavior modification\" and \"Technology designed sp ecifically for conflict short of war, especially psychological , biological, and defensive technology.\" Also mentioned is that \"larg e numbers of Americans may find themselves in areas of instabili ty and conflict,\" and that such individuals should be \"equ ipped with an electronic individual position locator device (IPLD ). The device, derived from the electronic bracelet used to contro l some criminal offenders or parolees, would continuously inform a central data bank of the individuals' locations. Ev entually such a device could be permanently implanted under the ski n.\" 264"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"The authors of the study lament the fact that \"The use of the new technology may also run counter to basic Americ an values,\" and, \"Deception, while frequently of great military or political value, is thought of as somehow 'un-American.'\" This is particularly true when it is practiced by A mericans upon Americans, the authors of the paper omit menti oning, although they do have a solution: \"Overcoming these constraints to make a RMA in conflict short of war would requir e fundamental change in the United States—an ethical and political revolution may be necessary to make a mil itary revolution.\" The authors state that as far as \"constraints and countermeasures,\" \"there is another alternative: we could deliberately engineer a comprehensive revolution, s eeking utter transformation rather than simply an expeditious us e of new technology.\" No, all indications suggest that non-lethal weaponr y is not about sticky foam and rubber bullets for crowd cont rol. [1] A report issued by the Pentagon's Commission on Rol es and Missions of May 1995 outlined four current military priorities. These were, as noted by Aviation Week & Space Techn ology magazine, (1) \"combating the proliferation of weapo ns of mass destruction\" (2) \"information warfare\" (3)\"peace op erations\" (4) and \"operations other than war.\" Although non-l ethal weapons might be of some use in arenas such as Bosn ia and Somalia, note that this breed of military engagemen t might just as well be applied to the policing of American urba n areas, or the suppression of a peace march. [2] According to military sources, with non-lethal tech nology they are attempting to create an \"architecture\" to handle \"in- between\" situations. An article in Aviation Week & Space Technology on non-lethality is worth quoting at len gth: \"The most profound implication of the new era often goes unremarked: Namely, that the basic rationale for de fense planning has shifted from threat to capability, and from liability to opportunity,' Adm. William A. Owens, vice chairm an of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote in the Naval Institute Press 'Proceedings' in May. Today, 'we must face the issu e of the political purpose of military force directly. It is no longer simply a matter of thinking it enough to counter successfu lly a defined military threat; we must design military forces mor e specifically in terms of their political purposes. In short, we must rebuild an intellectual framework that links our forces to our policy—no small task in a revolutionary era.' 265"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"\"Scientists and military officers insist that new peacekeeping/peace enforcement tactics and weapons can be effective only if merged with comprehensive, advanc ed information systems. Space, airborne and ground-bas ed sensors—including unattended devices—would provide a flood of data that enable decisive actions in non-combat sit uations. Information must be processed and routed to the pro per authorities in time to preclude hostile action, ide ally, or to enable rapid response if firing occurs. \"Sandia's [Gerold] Yonas maintained that this 'syst em of systems' will require an up-front science-based sys tems engineering (SBSE) approach to ensure resources are used effectively. Sensors, information systems, communic ations and rules-of-engagement must be coordinated within a comprehensive architecture. 'If you don't do it all right, you won't have a symphony. And massive use of force wil l not work. The bad guys will win,' he said.\" [3] One aspect of non-lethality, \"information warfare,\" was pursued at the Stanford Research Institute's Projec t Grill Flame at Langley, an investigation of \"remote viewing,\" i .e., out-of-body perception. The remote viewers were culled from Chu rch of Scientology members classed as OTs and Clears. Clea r is essentially a non-neurotic case, a level with a def inition that has been adjusted progressively downward in capability since Hubbard's early pronouncements about near-supermen. OT is the terminology for Operating Thetan, the ter m \"thetan\" taken from the Greek letter theta and used as the terminology for \"spirit\" in Scientology. Scientolog y OTs believe that they are free to operate as spirits outside of their physical bodies, thus presumably aiding their ability at rem ote viewing. Scientologists involved in the Grill Flame project included Ingo Swann, Harold Puthoff, and Pat Price, although I believe that Swann has since become disaffected from the ch urch and is now a member of a spin-off group called Avatar. At the time of the experiments, Swann is said to have denied CIA i nvolvement but later copped: \"It was rather common knowledge a ll along who the sponsor was, although in documents the iden tity of the Agency was concealed behind the sobriquet of 'an ea st coast scientist.' The Agency's interest was quite extensi ve. A number of agents of the CIA came themselves ultimately to SRI to act as subjects in remote viewing experiments, as did some members of Congress.\" An additional Grill Flame laboratory was added at F ort Meade in Maryland, run by General Stubblebine.

Indi viduals subjected to such forces may adapt through dissocia tion by generating an altered persona, or pseudo-identity.\" From the CIA experimentation in remote viewing with SRI, a gamut of private projects have been launched. [4] In 1997, the Air Force upped the ante on non-lethal ity—and mind control—by creating the position of Deputy Dir ector for Information Operations. Far from the Public Relatio ns position that it sounds like, it is in fact a division for \" offensive information warfare,\" that will be headed by Lt. Co l. Jimmy Miyamoto. The Information Operations office will co ordinate with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Securi ty Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, the CIA, the National Reconnaissance Office, Defense Airborne Reconnaissa nce Office, and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. The du ties of the office, according to Defense Week, will be to c oordinate Air Force efforts in non-lethality, including a psychol ogical operations drive to create holographic projectors w ith the capability \"to project persuasive messages and thre e- dimensional pictures of cloud, smoke, rain droplets , buildings... The use of holograms as a persuasive message will h ave worldwide application.\" [5] Another informative look at closure that is current ly taking place in the area of military weaponry is provided in an article by Colonel Michael Aquino, titled \"From PSYOP to MindW ar: The Psychology of Victory,\" that was reportedly submitt ed by Aquino to the Washington publication Military Review, but apparently rejected, thence sent in photocopies to members of Aquino's Temple of Set organization and others. Aquino, whose last published photo of himself shows a man 267"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"who looks like Grandpa Munster, complete with the p rominent widow's peak, is a familiar name to those who have researched political conspiracy; for newcomers, his dossier be ars repetition. Aquino received a master's degree in political scie nce from the University of California at Santa Barbara and h as reportedly qualified in Defense Attache, Strategic Intelligenc e, Psychological Operations, Special Forces, and the A irborne divisions in the army, supposedly reporting directl y to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Aquino reportedly served as a Tact ical Psychological Operations officer in the 82nd Airbor ne in Vietnam, and received the Bronze Star, the Air Meda l, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. In 1973 Aquino becam e executive officer of the 306th Psychological Operat ions Battalion at Fort McArthur in California. During the 1970s Aq uino was a prominent member of the Church of Satan but became disillusioned with LaVey's sideshow-style antics an d started his own group, the Temple of Set. According to a police intelligence report, dated Ju ly 1, 1981, the Temple of Set \"is a small group but nonetheless has several hundred members and operates on a national level. A quino is the official head of the organization and rules the organization through a council of nine, who are in fact his chie f lieutenants.\" At least two members of the \"council of nine\" at th at time were members of Army Intel. The army, interestingly enough, has never expressed any problem with Aquino's satanic beliefs, either durin g his association with LaVey or afterward. It is not outs ide the realm of possibility that LaVey's satanic practices are i n fact army sponsored. According to a Pentagon spokesperson, \"A quino has an absolute constitutional right [to his belief]... unless there is illegal behavior associated with it.\" In the late 1980s Aquino and an associate, Gary Ham bright, were accused by the San Francisco Police Department of being involved in a satanic child molestation ring center ed around the Presidio military base, where Aquino was stationed at the time. Twenty-two families filed $66 million in claims aga inst the army. Although formal charges were never filed against Aq uino, only against his associate, it is reported that parents of children allegedly abused claimed that it was because the ar my pressured federal investigators and the San Francisco police not to pursue the case. Apparently there were satanic activities taking pla ce at the Presidio at the time, as confirmed by the on-site i nvestigation of Bay Area reporter Linda Goldston, who found a bunke r behind 268"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"the intelligence offices with ritual symbols painte d on the walls.

The crazy science fiction imaginings of a satanist? Yes, but also the imaginings of a highly-placed member of U. S. Army intelligence, and almost certainly clearly reflecti ve of the ambitions of the controllers of this world. [6] NOTES: 1.

I believe that the primary reason that government agents have been involved in the UFO field has been to confuse the i ssue of advanced aeronautics and weapons testing—for instan ce, with disinformation that has turned the secret Nevada te sting base Area 51 into a hotbed of extraterrestrial alien act ivity. The government has even admitted issuing disinforma tional reports during the 1950s and '60s about UFOs that w ere in fact U-2 spyplane flights, but that admission serves as a cover-up in itself. I have commented at length upon this situat ion in my Casebook on Alternative 3 and Casebook on the Men i n Black, and the interested reader may follow that avenue at greater length there. When examining the issue of mind control related to the UFO experience, there is remarkable information showing that government manipulation may go far beyond the creat ion of disinformation, and the befuddling of researchers. Information has come to light in recent years suggesting that m any cases of so-called alien abduction may conceal another reali ty entirely: that of the simulation of alien abduction as a cove r for mind control experimentation. This possibility has been explored at length in a r ecent bookby Gregory Kanon on UFOs, The Great UFO Hoax: T he Final Solution to the UFO Mystery, but other researchers have traversed this territory for years, including Marti n Cannon, John Judge, Jacques Vallee, and myself. I believe that t he deceased conspiracy researcher Mae Brussell may have been th e first to suggest the idea of simulated alien abduction as a cover for mind control testing in one of her radio shows. One of the first persons in the intelligence commun ity to suggest that UFOs might serve a useful purpose was H. Marshall 271"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Caldwell, the Assistant Director for Scientific Int elligence for the CIA. He wrote a memo to then-CIA Director Walte r Smith reporting that, \"With world-wide sightings reported, it was found t hat, up to the time of the investigation, there had been in th e Soviet press no report or comment, even satirical, on flying sau cers, though Gromyko had made one humorous mention of the subjec t. With a State-controlled press, this could result only fr om an official policy decision. The question, therefore, arises as to whether or not these sightings: \"(1) could be controlled, \"(2) could be predicted, and \"(3) could be used from a psychological warfare poi nt of view, either offensively or defensively. \"The public concerns with the phenomena, which is reflected both in the United States press and in th e pressure of inquiry upon the Air Force, indicates that a fair p roportion of our population is mentally conditioned to the acceptanc e of the incredible. In this fact lies the potential for the touching-off of mass hysteria and panic.\" Caldwell also suggests, \"A study should be instituted to determine what, if any, utilization could be made of these phenomena by Uni ted States psychological warfare planners...\" On July 16, 1978, UFO witness Sergeant Clifford E. Stone, attempting to get to the bottom of the UFO question , filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the National Security Agency. One of the documents that Stone obtained wa s a National Security Agency unofficial draft titled \"S UBJECT: UFO'S\". The interesting material in the paper began a few paragraphs in: \"...2. Scientific Findings: Dr. Jacques Vallee, fam ed communications science expert, has studied thousand s of cases where human beings have observed unusual phenomena. He has found that the human response to such observation i s predictable and graphically depictable. Whether the person's psychological structure is being assaulted by the u nusual and shocking brutality of a murder or the strangeness o f a UFO sighting, the effect is the same: \"a. Initially as by a kind of psychological inertia , the mind records fairly objectively what the eye is reportin g. \"b. But when it has realized the strange nature of the phenomena it goes into shock. The mind likes to liv e in a comfortable world where it feels it knows what to e xpect, and 272"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"that is not too threatening either physically or ps ychologically. The unusual dispels the comfortable illusion the mi nd has created. This shock tears at the very mooring of th e human psychological structure. \"c. To protect itself against such an intrusive and threatening reality the mind will begin to add imag ination and interpretation to the incoming data to make it more acceptable. Since the mind is doing all this in haste some of t he hurriedly added details and suggestions tumble over one anoth er and contradict one another in a bizarre fashion (as any police officer interrogating murder witnesses will tell you). \"d. Once the mind has constructed a safe framework for the new information it may again peek out and collect s ome more objective data. If the data is still threatening it will again go into shock and the process starts all over again. \"e. If the data is at the highest strangeness level where it brings terror either: \"(1) The mind will pass out and go into amnesia bur ying the events perhaps permanently in the unconsciousness. \"(2) The personal psychological will collapse and t he mind will reach down into its deepest place where \"that which cannot be destroyed\" is and it will abandon itself to this entity for survival protection. Encounter with this changeless indestructible entity is usually referred to as a r eligious experience. In the confusion and the shock, this ex perience is often attributed to the shocking event or object an d that is why primitive peoples worship such bizarre things as ai rplanes or cigarette lighters. \"f. The degree of strangeness of the phenomena dict ates how many people the mind is willing and able to tel l the event to. A mildly unusual or shocking event will be told to many people. A very shocking event of high strangeness w ill be told to few people or practically none at all. Occasionally the event is so shockingly unusual that it isn't even reported to t he person's conscious mind but is buried in the unconscious of the person where it is only accessible to hypnosis or careful level six communication, sharing with another person.\" This fascinating, even \"Tavistockian\" document seem s to go well beyond the average military reporting on the U FO phenomenon, and illustrates well why simulated UFO abduction may be useful to mind controllers: the experience i s so incredible and so demeaning that it is communicated to few if any other persons, and sometimes may exist in memor y only at an unconscious level. Additionally, \"high strang eness\" may in 273"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"fact be a means of accessing deeper levels of the m ind. In the late 1980s Dr. Michael Persinger, a neurolog ist at the Laurentian University of Ontario, Canada, did initi al tests on what has come to be known as the 'Persinger helmet. \" This is a device that directs specific electromagnetic freque ncies at the hippocampus area of the back brain of the person we aring it. According to Persinger, using the helmet, a large p ercentage of subjects feel that they have been abducted by UFOs, have gone out of body, or have experienced other forms of alt ered consciousness, including 'union with God.' The expe rience, Persinger says, \"involves a widening of emotional m eaning, such that things not typically considered significant wo uld now be considered meaningful.\" During back brain irradiati on, hallucinations are \"perceived as extremely real.\" Susan Blackmore, who experienced the Persinger technology, wrote of it in the New Scientist in Nov ember, 1994: \"Persinger applied a silent and invisible force to my brain and created a specific experience for me. He claimed th at he was imitating the basic sequences of the processes of m emory and perception and that, by varying those sequences, he could control my experience. Could he have done it from a distance? Could it be done on a wider scale? Suddenly prospec ts of magnetic mind control seem an awful lot worse than the idea of being abducted by imaginary aliens...\" [1] Persinger was involved in Operation Black Beauty, t he creation of a refrigerator-sized electromagnetic br oadcasting unit used to quell riots. The device is said to emp loy time- varying fields of extremely low frequency energy, b roadcast at frequencies between 1 and 10 hertz, that cause vomi ting in whomever the unit is trained on. [2] A short and non-definitive digression into a relate d phenomenon: cattle mutilations. These are the thous ands of mysterious cases of cattle that since the late 1960 s have been found dissected, sometimes in a surgical fashion, a nd which are usually linked in the media to flying saucer interv ention. A case could be made for the \"mutes\" being an issue of min d control in themselves, but put that aside. There is a large bo dy of evidence suggesting that the mutilations are of a far more t errestrial nature than tabloid TV will allow us to imagine. For starters, UFOs are almost never seen in the vic inity of cattle mutilation, that is, using the strict defini tion of unidentified flying OBJECTS. What are seen are usua lly unidentified lights and, when a craft is seen, it i s usually a black unmarked helicopter. There is no limit to the rab idity of some 274"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"UFO buffs, and so the black choppers are sometimes mentioned as being shape-shifting extraterrestrial craft, whe n in fact there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest this. Why not, instead, go out on a limb and simply imagine that they are blac k helicopters? Other evidence suggests that men, not alien monster s, are doing the mutilations. Toxicology tests sometimes s how the presence of nicotine in the bovine carcasses, and n icotine is a commonly used ingredient in tranquilizer dart drugs . The animals are sometimes found to have been marked wit h fluorescent paint, presumably for identification in the dark. Also, often seen in the vicinity of mutilations are truck-trailer rigs, large enough for transporting small helicopte rs. At least one probable staging area for the mutilation episod es has been identified in Colorado, as noted in my book Black H elicopters II: The Endgame Strategy. Why would humans be interested in mutilating cattle ? The most probable answer was provided by G.C. Errianne, a private investigator who looked into the matter. Erriane in dicated that covert government testing was done using cattle due to the similarity of the membrane of the eye with \"a certa in ethnic group.\" Further investigation showed that the U.S. government had been involved in testing biowarfare weapons spe cifically targeted to at least two ethnicities. [3] As far as government manipulation involving humans, one of the \"premier\" abduction cases that seems to have se t the stage for many that followed was that of Betty and Barney Hill. In 1961 the Hills were motoring in Groveton, New Hamps hire, when a flying disk craft approached and hovered at a distance. The Hills fled in their car but later, because of n ightmares, consulted a psychiatrist and were hypnotized. Six m onths of therapy seemed to reveal an abduction and physical examination by humanoids in the disk craft. The nature of the abduction itself was quite strang e, with the inhabitants of the saucer craft being described by Betty Hill under hypnosis as wearing uniforms and billed caps (\"similar to Air Force,\" she said during hypnotic regression). B arney Hill thought that one of the supposed aliens looked like a \"military pilot,\" and amended that: \"He looks like a German N azi. He's a Nazi...\" Hill said, \"I thought of the Navy and the submarine, and I thought the men that moved back were just dressed in blue denims. But this other man was dressed in a black s hiny coat, with a cap on.\" If the government was involved in the abduction, wh at might 275"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"have brought the Hills to their attention was the f act that they were an interracial couple, and held organizational positions in a number of civil rights groups. This was at a time w hen such groups were under close scrutiny by the government, and it may have suited military psy-ops to either examine the Hills hypnotically, or even implant bugging devices for s urveillance. The Hills were also close friends with Major James McDonald, reportedly working in intelligence at Pease Air For ce Base. [4] Another famous abductee whose experience deserves c loser scrutiny is Whitley Streiber. Streiber went to the Fabian- founded London School of Economics in England. Whil e in London, he directed a film about The Process cult g roup, although with no prints of the film available, it i s not known what position Streiber took in regards to the cult. In his best-selling book about abduction, Communion , Streiber notes that for years he had believed that he was present at the Charles Whitman shooting spree at the Univer sity of Texas, but finally realized that he wasn't. In the sequel, Transformation, Streiber realizes that he must have been, because of a friend's confirmation. [5] Streiber believes that he has two implants in his b ody, one in an earlobe, the other injected into a little finger . At the 1996 Gulf Breeze, Florida, UFO Conference Streiber menti oned the idea that he might have been the subject of mind co ntrol operations by the government. He speculated that hi s believed experiences with extraterrestrial aliens may in fac t have been broadcast to him through the implants. [6] Martin Cannon, a pioneer in making the distinction between little grey men from outer space and those from the government, describes the case of a woman he calls \"Veronica.\" She was abducted not into a flying saucer, but into the house of a scientist in Los Angeles who, Cannon was able to de termine, had earlier been involved in CIA mind control experimen tation. I investigated the case of a young woman who, in 19 93, believed that during a visit in San Francisco with the head of a satanic church she had been drugged and taken to a nearby hotel where she was operated upon by humans in whit e coats. On another occasion she was taken outside of San Fr ancisco by the same satanic chief and was shown a disk craft p arked at some distance from a rural road. [7] And if Jolly West and his crowd are promoting \"Fals e Memory Syndrome,\" they are also pushing \"Alien Memory Synd rome.\" According to an Australian researcher, \"one of Loui s Jolyon West's proteges, Barry Taff, co-wrote an article for UFO 276"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"magazine suggesting aliens were responsible for thi s type of [mind control] activity. Taff worked at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, and according to Los An geles based researcher Martin Cannon, has consulted for a large number of government agencies, including the National Institu te of Mental Health, Rand Corporation, the Atomic Energy Commiss ion and the CIA.\" Val Bankston, who believed that she had been abduct ed by aliens, met Taff and agreed to participate in some experiments on abduction with him. Bankston said, \"You may reco gnize the name Barry Taff. He researched and wrote a movie ca lled 'The Entity.' He also conducts parapsychology investigat ions, pursues effects that he covertly produces himself with high technology. Oddly enough, shortly after we met, I was assaulted by a disembodied entity in broad daylight who engaged in sexual acts with me. At the time, I believed it was an incubus. Knowing what I do about Barry, the fact that he is a certif ied hypnotist, for one I believe that he hypnotized both me and th e other subject of his research—which led to the movie 'The Entity'—into having these experiences. He may have treated several women this way and picked the one that best bolstered his book and movie scheme.\" [8] Another remarkable case is that of Bruce Smith, who in 1990 attended a lecture by \"alien abduction expert\" Budd Hopkins in Trenton, New Jersey. For some reason Hopkins' talk about alien abductions hit Smith at a visceral level, unnerving him: \"I didn't think I was going to be able to walk out of there,\" he said later. But Smith did walk out of the UFO lecture and, hook ing his trailer home onto the back of his car, went west, s topping in state parks. One of those state parks was in Tesuqu e, New Mexico. Smith was asleep in a campground there when he woke up in the middle of the night, horrified with the b elief that aliens were going to abduct him. Drifting between s leep and wakefulness, Smith felt hands grasp his ankles and pull. But the being on the other end of those hands was not quite what Smith had been led to expect. The \"being\" was wearing a w hite button-down shirt, the kind of shirt that his fathe r had always worn, Smith recalled. Far from his expectation of a glowing silver saucer craft, Smith says that he was manhandled into the back of a large, dark blue van with military markings that he thinks were of the U.S. Navy. The van drove over rough roads for an ho ur until it stopped. The rear door of the van was opened and al iens levitated Smith out the back door and into a huge s tructure that 277"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Smith feels is part of the Los Alamos nuclear labor atory. Inside the laboratory, Smith was placed on an exami nation table where an alien named \"Roget\" gouged at his ey es with a scalpel. Smith remembered none of this until he began hypnot herapy in Washington. During hypnosis he remembered the ab duction, and also recalled that he had been abducted \"thousa nds of times and during many lifetimes.\" After the encounter in Tesuque, \"They came back one more time. On the eighth of Jun e. They came in an unusual ship that had rooms in it that l ooked like college dorm rooms.\" Was Smith actually abducted by aliens, or is the tr uth something more prosaic but equally sinister? [9] UFO abduction researcher Budd Hopkins turns up in a nother case, described by former Army Intelligence case of ficer Julianne McKinney, now of the Electronic Surveillan ce Project Association of National Security Alumni. McKinney's account follows: \"The woman, apparently a 'pet' experimentee, found herself being introduced to a wide variety of prominent ind ividuals whose connections with the CIA she believed to be q uite apparent. One of those, she states, was Robert Jay Lifton, a well known author and expert on brainwashing, whose book s include The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psycholog y of Genocide (Basic books, 1986). \"Her experiences included a voluntary ('referral') admission to Hollywood Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in 1973, during an era when MKULTRA experiments in the Allan Memorial Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Ca nada, were only beginning to capture the attention of the U.S. Senate. \"More recently, in 1990, she was transported to New York University's Cameron Medical Center, in Westchester , NY (under circumstances which qualify as an abduction), where she was forcibly wrestled to the ground by approximately si x Center staffers and forcibly confined for a period of appr oximately three weeks. She was neither psychiatrically counseled no r formally tested while in that facility. The psychiatrists as signed to her case appeared more intent on forcing her to take a combination of neuroleptic drugs, to include Haldol, Navane and Cogentin. (Haldol and Navane can cause tardive dyskinesia.) S he resisted those attempts. \"A court ultimately ordered this woman released fro m the Center, stipulating that she was not to be administ ered drugs. On subsequently acquiring her medical re cords, under 278"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"conditions which prevented censoring or doctoring o f those records, she found that her psychiatrists had plann ed to inject her with drugs (in defiance of the court order) on the day of her release. As luck would have it, she was released a day early. \"This woman states also that she has met Budd Hopki ns, of the Intruders Foundation, and that she had a long-t erm, confiding relationship with John E. Mack, Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and founding Di rector of the Center for Psychological Studies in the Nuclear Age (previously named Research Program for the Study of Human Continuity; and still previously rumored to have co operated with the CIA in studies of 'human ecology').\" [10] In recent years there have been cases of \"alien\" im plants being surgically removed, but it is interesting tha t the \"aliens\" would coincidentally be employing a technology simi lar to that invented by Dr. Delgado in the 1950s. One such inst ance was described in a lecture by Dr. Roger Leir, at a MUFO N meeting in Thousand Oaks, California, on February 23, 1996. Le ir removed three apparent implants on August 19, 1995, two fro m one patient and one from another patient. The two alleg ed implants removed from the first patient were located on each side of her large toe. The third alleged implant was removed fr om the back of the left hand of another patient. One object was triangular in shape, while the other two objects \"resembled small cantaloupe seeds.\" [11] Surrounding the implants the tissue was grey but wi thout inflammation. According to Darrel Sims, a hypno-ane stheia therapist and UFO abduction researcher, both person s had been unaware of the implants, but they were discovered d uring unrelated x-ray procedures. There were no scar trac es from injection of the implants. Both patients, according to Sims, were possible cases of UFO abduction. Dr. Leir also reports that the objects were in close proximity to nerve fibers . Dr. Leir used a gauss meter, measuring electromagne tic fields, in finding the exact locations of the objec ts. According to Dr. Leir, when he brought the gauss meter near the object in the man's hand, it \"went crazy.\" Each of the objects is reported to have been covere d with a dense grey membrane. Although objects that have bee n in a human body for a long time do get coated with an or ganic, fibrous coating, this material can be scraped off. In the case of the alleged implants, the membrane was much more di fficult to remove. Inside the membrane the objects were two se parate pieces of black metal, apparently held together only by the 279"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"membrane. The metal was later identified as boron. When exposed to fluorescent light, all three objects glo wed brightly. [12] Harvard's John Mack, in Abductions, provides a deta iled look at another \"alien\" implant: \"Elemental analyses and electronic microscopic phot ography revealed an interestingly twisted fiber consisting of carbon, silicon, oxygen, no nitrogen, and traces of other e lements. A carbon isotopic analysis was not remarkable. A nucl ear biologist colleague said the 'specimen' was not a naturally o ccurring biological subject but could be a manufactured fibe r of some sort. It seemed difficult to know how to proceed further. \"There is no evidence that any of the implants reco vered are of rare elements, or of common ones in unusual comb inations. In discussions with a chemical engineer and other e xperts in materials technology, I have been told that it woul d be extremely difficult to make a positive diagnosis of the natur e of any unknown substance without having information about its origins. Under the best of circumstances it would be difficu lt to prove, for example, that a substance was not of terrestria l or even biological origins.\" Of course John Mack is an interesting case in himse lf, a man who seemingly refuses to consider the idea that abd uctions might be performed by anyone other than extraterres trials. Mack's Center for Psychology and Social Change is b acked to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars by various members of the Rockefeller family. Mack is also a member of Sc ott Jones' Human Potential Foundation, also reported to be Roc kefeller- endowed. [13] My conclusion is mad and science fictional, but the evidence supports it. Military and intelligence agencies are using alien abduction as a cover story and possibly as close en counters simulated by technology such as holograms and advan ced aerial disk craft to conceal the processing and implanting of human beings with mind control technology.

Although many of the elements of the current UFO be lief system, including alien invasion, have been around since the beginnings of UFO research in the 1950s, the burst in media activity that took place in the 1980s can be traced to a few sources. The first and most influential can be isol ated with the individuals who went about hoaxing Paul Bennewitz. Although the Bennewitz case is only one of many instances wh ere the UFO experience was apparently manipulated by agents of the government, it is representative and revealing. In 1980 Bennewitz—often referred to in UFO literatu re as a \"physicist,\" although he never obtained a degree—an d well- known UFO researcher Dr. Leo Sprinkle were in touch with a young woman, Judy Doraty, who believed she had witn essed a calf stolen by a saucer and had been abducted by al iens. According to Doraty, in May of 1980 she and her you ng son had been driving near Cimarron, New Mexico, when they h ad observed \"two or more\" UFOs, and the theft of a cal f via saucer. Doraty claimed at that time she and her son were ab ducted, and that she was taken to an underground base for exami nation and implanting with an alien device. At the base she ha d observed vats of unidentifiable body parts, and a vat with a male human floating in it. Bennewitz paid for medical examinations of the pair including CAT scans, which reportedly confirmed the existence of the implants in the woman and her son. Bennewitz believed that \"at least 300,000 or more in the U.S. and at l east 2,000,000 if not more worldwide\" had been implanted with cerebral control devices by the aliens, although hi s means of 283"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"detecting these implants seems somewhat subjective: \"You can recognize them because of their eyes... [a] peculia r look in the eyes and a funny smile.\" [1] *Bennewitz, the owner of an electronics research laboratory, attempted to detec t the electromagnetic signals that he felt the aliens mus t be using to control her, and to find out a way to shield people from these signals. In late 1979 he told members of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization of detecting these low freque ncy signals, and that he had begun to make calculations about el ectronic and propulsive techniques employed by the aliens. At the same time, from his home in the Four Hills a rea of Albuquerque, New Mexico, he was photographing unide ntified lights in the area of the Manzano Nuclear Weapons S torage Facility east of Kirtland Air Force Base. Bennewitz believed that he had \"established constant direct communication w ith the Alien using a computer and a form of Hex Decimal Co de with Graphics and print-out.\" The specific way in which Bennewitz believed he had established this link is not known to this researcher, although he did mention that when a UFO was in sight he would ask it telepathic messages. One blin k of the saucer was a 'yes,' two blinks a 'no.' Bennewitz su pposedly produced a vocabulary of 27 words that he communica ted to the aliens with. [2] Eventually Bennewitz believed that he had discovere d an alien base a mile beneath the earth at Dulce, New Mexico, as well as one on the west slope of nearby Mount Archeleta, wi th an estimated alien population of 2,000. He took aerial photos of the reputed base at Dulce from a helicopter, and be lieved that he had viewed and taken photos of saucer craft, beam w eapons, and aliens on the ground, although when the pictures we re developed, these photos were inexplicably missing f rom the series. Bennewitz produced a written report on his research titled Project Beta, which is primarily a primitive \"Look out boys! The Aliens are here!\" study of alien psychology, as wel l as proposed means by which the army might destroy the alien bas es—using Bennewitz' company, Thunder Electronics, as a sub-c ontractor for his own beam weapons inventions. According to the report, he had spent two years in surveillance of \"alien ships within a sixty (60) mi le radius of Albuquerque,\" as well as \"Detection and disassembly of alien communication and video channels—both local, earth, and near space.\" Bennewitz believed he had received \"Constan t reception of video from alien ship and u nderground base 284"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"viewscreeen; Typical alien, humanoid and at times a pparent Homo Sapien.\" During the period of his research, Bennewitz was cl osely in touch with a military officer named Major Edwards, at the Manzano facility, and he gave several presentations to \"high level\" Air Force personnel at the base. He reported that he had also surveilled an alleged alien base in the compan y of Edwards. UFO researcher Jacques Vallee was told by William M oore that \"[Bennewitz] had innocently stumbled on a sign al used in a secret Air Force experiment that was totally unrela ted to UFOs. He was approached by security officers who tried to get him to disconnect this equipment and to stop monitoring th eir electromagnetic tests. The more they did this, of c ourse, the more Bennewitz was convinced they had something to hide (which was true) and that it had to do with UFOs (w hich was false). And he refused to comply.\" [3] While Bennewitz watched the military, they watched him. People came to his door \"out of the blue,\" and he s aw implant scars on the back of their necks. \"The aliens have gone wild,\" Bennewitz wrote, paralyzing him four times and inje cting him 250 times \"with hypodermics.\" To understand the saga of Paul Bennewitz, additiona l background is necessary. Although I was not present at the 1989 MUFON conference at which William Moore spoke, Jacques Vallee was, and gave the following descript ion: \"In a confused and embarrassing presentation before the MUFON Conference, Bill Moore indeed confessed that he had willingly allowed himself to be used by various peo ple claiming to act on behalf of Air Force Intelligence and that he had knowingly disseminated disinformation, although he had never been 'on the payroll.' This is a mere play on words , of course. Not being on the payroll does not mean that he was not paid in cash or through other means... \"Moore gave a weak excuse for his actions, claiming that he had acted in a heroic private effort to infiltrate and expose the operation.\" William Moore has said that in early September 1980 , he, Moore, was contacted by a \"well-placed individual w ithin the intelligence community who claimed to be directly c onnected to a high-level project dealing with UFOs.\" This man, known as \"Falcon,\" said that he was part of a group that wan ted to expose the continuing government cover-up of UFOs. Moore a dmits that he went along with the man in order to gain ac cess to government UFO information. Z85"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Acting as liaison between Moore and the group was S gt. Richard Doty. Moore soon learned his own role, whic h was to provide information on Bennewitz in exchange for \"s ensitive\" information on UFOs. He also learned that \"several government agencies\" were collaborating in discrediting Bennew itz by funnelling disinformation to him. \"By 1981,\" Moore says, \"Paul was gathering data fro m a variety of sources and amalgamating it with informa tion being fed to him by a number of government people in whom , for some reason, he seemed to have an implicit and abid ing faith. The story that emerged from this melange of fact, f iction, fantasy, hearsay, hard data and government disinfor mation was absolutely incredible! Yet somehow, Paul believed i n it and set out on a one-man crusade to tell the world that mal evolent aliens from space were in league with our governmen t to take over the planet. What had begun in 1979 as an effor t to learn whether the behavior of a woman who claimed she had been abducted by UFO aliens and was being influenced by some sort of radio remote control had, in the space of less than three years, blossomed into a tale which rivaled the wildest sci ence fiction scenario anyone could possibly imagine.\" \"My role in the affair,\" said Moore, \"was largely t hat of a freelancer providing information on Paul's current thinking and activities. I had nothing whatsoever to do with the counter- intelligence and disinformation, although I either knew or was aware of a number of people involved in that end of things.\" [4] It may be significant that William Moore's first tw o books, The Philadelphia Experiment and The Roswell Inciden t were co-authored with Charles Berlitz who, according to the Seattle Times/Post Intelligencer, at the beginning of World War II, \"was taken out of the Air Force to work in counter-intel ligence. He is reluctant to talk about this period and his work as an operative ('nobody likes to say 'spy') in anything but the fo ggiest terms. But he was, clearly, the perfect operative. 'I woul d pretend that I was a Frenchman in Venezuela or a Venezuelan in F rance.' During the war he worked underground, with a new na me and identity, in various countries.\" The article indica tes that Berlitz' connections with the spy biz did not end with World War II, but that \"He resumed his intelligence work, though not overseas, during the Korean and Vietnam wars.\" [5] While Bennewitz monitored low frequency electronic broadcasts and filmed unusual aerial displays that may or may not have been saucer craft, the government was moni toring him and, I suspect, destroying him. Moore says that Bennewitz 286"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"detected instances of surveillance, but that there were wiretaps and break-ins that Bennewitz didn't know about. One of these instances may have happened when Benne witz was visited at home by an anonymous man with a \"top secret document that was dated in the '50's, indicating if anybody found out about all of this they would kill them.\" Bennewitz was asked, \"Doesn't that bother you?\" He responded that it didn't. It may have been that the information offered Bennewitz was the counterfeit MJ-12 documen t later circulated by Moore associate Jaime Shandera. Bennewitz was apparently under observation from a h ouse across the street from his own, and took photos of persons visiting the house with NORAD and Air Force license plates. [6] By 1982, the alien scenario that Bennewitz was bein g fed was essentially that of the belief structure held by a large portion of the UFO community today. Malevolent grey aliens wer e abducting humans, mutilating cattle, and implanting humans with control devices. They had made a treaty with t he U.S. government, and had an underground base in Dulce, N ew Mexico, and for these concessions they had given sa ucers and weaponry to the government. In addition, there was a benevolent group of aliens intent on stopping the d estructive Greys from ravaging the planet. As time went on, Bennewitz had a nervous breakdown reportedly due to the disinformation he was being f ed by government agents. According to Moore, Bennewitz st ocked his house with guns and knives and installed extra lock s, although Bennewitz believed the aliens were able to come thr ough the walls and inject him with chemicals that knocked hi m out. Bennewitz suffered from insomnia and his hands shoo k, as if they were palsied. Eventually he was hospitalized a nd placed under psychiatric care. [7] On the other hand, perhaps it was not just disinfor mation that derailed Bennewitz. There is the possibility t hat he was neutralized by ELF irradiation or other forms of go vernment mind control that drove him crazy. After Bennewitz, the web of disinformation continue d to spread. In 1983 Linda Moulton Howe, a well-known UF O researcher who oddly seems unable to entertain any other idea than that UFOs are from outer space, was working on an HBO documentary on UFOs. According to Moore, \"when the filmmaker [Howe] appeared on the scene, and it look ed as if Paul's story might become part of the script, the counterintelligence people simply ex tended their 287"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"disinformation activities accordingly.\" Howe met Richard Doty at Kirtland Air Force Base in a building posted as an Air Force Office of Special I nvestigations office. Once inside, Howe was taken to a room to sp eak with Doty. Howe believed that they were going to discuss a UFO sighting that had taken place at Ellsworth Air Forc e base, but Doty began talking about her UFO documentary, leadi ng her to believe that she had been closely monitored during the film's production. Doty told her that her research, and in particular an earlier documentary titled Strange Harvest, had ups et people, with the implication that they were ranking militar y people. Doty also told her that his superiors had asked him to show her the contents of a plain brown envelope, which he re moved from a desk drawer. Although she was allowed to read the contents of the envelope, she was not permitted to take notes. Inside the envelope was a document titled \"Briefing Paper for the President of the United States of America About Unidentified Aerial Vehicles,\" or very similar word s. The \"Briefing Paper\" described incidents of flying sauc er crashes in Aztec, New Mexico; Kingman, Arizona; Mexico; and tw o in Roswell, New Mexico. According to the briefing, two species of extraterr estrials had established contact with the U.S. government. One s pecies was the well-known Greys, while the other was not descr ibed. The document mentioned that extraterrestrials had been responsible for creating Jesus Christ as a means for influencin g human behavior. The madness would spread. The UFO field would soon collide with the political conspiracy research fiel d and with the underground patriot movement, and men like Bill Coo per, John Lear, and others would be proclaiming that the secr etive men who ruled the world were not men at all. What was d one to Bennewitz and Howe on an individual case basis, was soon being done to the American public on a much wider scale—a nd is still being done by disinformation agents and the gullibl e souls who believe them. Richard Doty, at the time of the Bennewitz affair, is believed to have been working for the Air Force Office of Sp ecial Investigations. He had been trained in disinformati on and psychological warfare, and allegedly admitted that he was a member of a disinformation group—probably the Aviar y, to be taken up later in this text. According to published reports, William Moore state d that Doty reported to a Pentagon official n amed Hennessey, 288"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"reportedly chief of security for the Stealth projec t. It is impossible to gauge Doty's actual connections and responsibilities, since portions of his service rec ords are expunged, although while stationed at Linsay Air Fo rce Base in West Germany, according to Phillip Klass, \"Doty was charged with falsifying official documents and telling fals ehoods to his commanding officer. A formal investigation confirme d these charges and Doty was 'decertified' as a special age nt [with the] Air Force Office of Special Investigations and retu rned to Kirtland AFB in late 1986. Doty spent his last two years before retirement in food services management.\" [8] The plot thickens. Researcher Lee Graham has said t hat William Moore contacted him \"in an intelligence cap acity\" and that Moore said he worked for the government in rel easing sensitive UFO information. According to Graham, Moo re had shown him a Defense Investigation Service badge, al though UFO researcher and \"nuclear physicist\" Stanton Friedman in his 1996 apologia for the bogus MJ-12 documents titled Top Secret/Majic puts a different spin on the event. Fr iedman said, \"As a joke, Bill once pulled out a MUFON identifica tion card, flashed it at Lee, and indicated that he was workin g for the government. Lee bought it.\" This sidesteps the alle ged impersonation of a government official, Graham's me mory of a DIS badge, not a MUFON card, the fact that Moore ha s admitted to being a government agent, and the bottom line th at the joke is unfunny. One wonders why Friedman would go out o f his way to disclaim the government connection of an admitte d government collaborator. [9] The group that was functioning behind the scenes in the Bennewitz story was probably the Aviary. In 1988 Se ligman Productions purchased from William Moore interviews with two alleged government agents who went by the names Fal con and Condor. They spoke behind screens during the filmin g, allegedly out of fear of retaliation from their emp loyers. In the final product, broadcast on national television und er the title UFO Cover-Up Live!, their UFO revelations were cobb led together with computer graphics of aliens and alien internal organs that were claimed to have been done by the g overnment; a kind of gut level MJ-12 document. The computer gr aphics were nothing of the sort. They were based upon earl ier drawings published by UFO researcher Leonard String field. [10] The revelations that Falcon and Condor offered were predictable: confirmation of crashed saucers, live and dead aliens, and the existence of the overarching secret government 289"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"MJ-12 agency charged with investigating and keeping the lid on the existence of aliens. According to researcher Ro bert Hastings, the two anonymous agents doing the alien whistle- blowing were familiar face Sgt. Richard Doty, Air F orce OSI agent, and Robert Collins, an Air Force captain. [1 1] William Moore has said that Doty was not Falcon, bu t was in fact a liaison for another person. This person is p ossibly C.B. Scott Jones, identified as \"Falcon,\" a member of U. S. Navy Intelligence for 15 years, and a collaborator with \"non-lethality\" heavy weight John B. Alexander. Does this mean that neither Doty nor Collins were actual members of what appear s to be a secret intelligence agency group, but were masquera ding as such, or employed at a lower level? Certainly their credentials are not in the same league as the other reported me mbers of the group. There is another echelon (perhaps the only actual g roup) reported as being members of the Aviary who cannot be connected to UFO disinformation except in a tangent ial way. Two alleged members of the Aviary, C.B. Scott Jones and John B. Alexander, are said to have met William Moore at a party. Then there are the bird names used by Doty and Coll ins, although this does not prove membership in, but per haps only knowledge of the Aviary. This distinction is not of ten noted by researchers who maintain that the Aviary is \"a grou p of intelligence and Department of Defense officers and scientists with a brief to discredit any serious research in t he UFO field.\" This statement is probably true, but I am obliged t o point out that the evidence at this time is circumstantial. [ 12] Alleged members of the flock are: C.B. Scott Jones, reported to be \"Falcon.\" After a long career in Naval Intelligence, Jones \"worked in the private sector research and development community involved in the U.S. government sponsored projects for the Defense Nucle ar Agency (DNA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and U.S. A rmy Intelligence and Security Command.\" He was also a c ollaborator with John B. Alexander, and the head of the Rockefe ller Foundation. [13] Colonel John B. Alexander, retired, reported to be \"Penguin,\" who has long been involved in fringe science and parapsychological pursuits, and is the man who inve nted the \"non-lethality\" approach in the military. Alexander is on the board of directors for Psi-Tech, a remote viewing c ompany that also employs Major Edward Dames (formerly of the DIA), a 290"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"frequent guest on the nationwide Art Bell talk radi o show. Dames was, I believe, one of the persons talking on the Bell show about the companion spaceship of the Hale-Bopp comet, information that sent the Heaven's Gate group over the edge to suicide. Ron Pandolphi, allegedly \"Pelican,\" is a Ph.D. in p hysics who works at the Office of the Deputy Director of Scien ce and Technology in the CIA. [14] Dr. Christopher Green, allegedly \"Bluejay,\" from th e CIA. Harold Puthoff, said to be \"Owl,\" ex-NSA, a Sciento logist at last report, and involved in remote viewing studies . Dr. Jack Verona, said to be \"Raven,\" employed by th e Department of Defense, and reportedly involved in c reating the DIA's Sleeping Beauty mind assault electromagnetic weapons. Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., reported to be \"Seagull,\" is an expert in optical physics and laser weapons at the U.S. Na val Surface Weapons Laboratory in Maryland. He is an author on UFO topics, and a consultant to MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network. Prior to the publication of a paper revealing the a lleged identities of the Aviary, researcher Armen Victoria n was visited by the anonymous \"Morning Dove\" and \"Hawk,\" \"who ha d travelled to the UK with a message from the senior ranks advising me not to go ahead with my expose. I rejec ted this proposal.\" [15] On examination, the group has several shared intere sts. These are remote viewing and non-lethal weaponry. It is, of course, understandable why the government would want to confuse and neutralize the UFO research com munity, even if there are no aliens at Area 51, Dulce, or a ny other facility. UFO researchers from early on have probably been co nsidered a kind of citizens' spy agency, snooping and reportin g on activities that take place in the air and in the vicinity of m ilitary bases. Those investigative reports, circulated via a large number of books, journals, and videos, are also freely availa ble to foreign powers. A secondary priority of military intelligence may b e to encourage UFO whistleblowers from within the milita ry and intelligence community to report to UFO \"experts\" c overtly connected to the government, thus identifying thems elves and allowing the government to stop leaks of classified information. It is curious that disinformation connected to the Aviary by researchers is mostly of an amateurish variety, lik e the computer graphics of UFO Cover-up Live!

Some hypnotherapists an d alleged victims have come forward telling of the ex istence of this supposedly CIA-sponsored program, while a floo d of copycat reports have relied on these sources. A book published in 1995, Trance Formation of Ameri ca, was written on the subject by a confessed victim, Cathy O'Brien, and her deprogrammer husband, Mark Phillips. In this ap parently vanity-printed tome O'Brien alleges that she was a victim of MKULTRA MONARCH mind control for the majority of he r life, and was only rescued when she was deprogrammed at t he age of 30 by Phillips, who says that he is a formerly CIA- connected hypnotherapist. Trance Formation of America is prefaced with a long , poorly written—in fact, barely literate—introduction by Ph illips, who alleges that he is a former employee of the CIA, or at least of a CIA cutout called Capital International Airways. Ph illips mentions being present at least one \"video taping o f a TOP SECRET psychiatric experiment\" around 1970. \"While I lack the official published academic crede ntials,\" Phillips says, \"I am recognized internationally by mental health and law enforcement professionals as an authority o n the secret science concerning external control of the mind.\" I t is interesting that there is no substantiation of this recognition in the book. What the slug of business cards that Phil lips reprints do suggest is that he was a salesman for several co mpanies, and was a hypnotherapist practicing for some period of time in Nashville, although lacking \"the official published academic credentials,\" I wonder about the legality of that. According to Phillips, at one point during the deprogramming of Cathy O'Brien, he was given the na me and phone number of Jolyon \"Jolly\" West, at UCLA. \"L ittle did I 293"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"know,\" Phillips reports, \"that Dr. West had worked for the CIA in Project MK-Ultra mind control research for decad es.\" Phillips must in truth have known very little, sinc e if he had cracked even one book on mind control he would cert ainly have come across West's name several times. O'Brien—actually a much more competent writer than Phillips—recounts her alleged history as a drug and electroshock mind-controlled slave-prostitute, beginning shortly after her birth in Michigan 1957, with early child abuse by h er father and two uncles, including her being filmed in bestialit y movies produced by her father. O'Brien alleges incidents of prostitution, mind con trol, and abuse by priests at various Catholic churches in Mi chigan; Michigan Congressman Guy VanderJagt; President Gera ld Ford; Senator Robert C. Byrd; Senator James Traficant; Pe nnsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh; Senator Patrick Leahy; Go vernor of Tennessee Lamar Alexander; Dodger baseball manager Tommy LaSorda; President Ronald Reagan; General Manuel No riega; Contra leader Daniel Ortega; CIA Director William C asey; baseball player Nolan Ryan; Secretary of Education Bill Benn et; President George Bush; Hillary Clinton; and a bevy of others including, quoting O'Brien, \"friends, local mobsters and Mason s, relatives, Satanists, strangers, and police officers.\" According to O'Brien's recollection, many of those whom she would come in contact with and be prostituted to du ring her period as a mind controlled slave were trained in a complicated series of MONARCH verbal commands, mostly consistin g of punning phrases relating to the Wizard of Oz, Disne y films, and television shows like I Dream of Jeannie, The Brady Bunch, and Bewitched. No Nietzche or Alfred Rosenberg? That wo uld seem more to the tastes of the mind controllers that I k now about. These phrases would be used to manipulate her and o ther MONARCH victims, causing them to shift from one pro grammed identity to another. In 1974, according to O'Brien's account, she was ta ken to MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, where she receiv ed additional mind control programming, then in 1975 she was take n to Wyoming, where she claims she was tortured and rape d by Dick Cheney, then-White House Chief of Staff to Presiden t Ford. In 1976, she recalls, she was taken to the Kennedy Spa ce Center in Titusville, Florida, where she received her firs t NASA mind control programming. Involved tangentially in the country music business , O'Brien found that most of the big names in that industry w ere either 294"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"mind-controlled slaves (Barbara Mandrell, Louise Ma ndrell, Loretta Lynn), or CIA-run slave masters (Louise Man drell's husband R.C. Bannon, Boxcar Willie, Alex Houston, K ris Kristopherson, Louise Mandrell's father Irby Mandre ll, Jimmy Buffet). According to O'Brien, CIA-involved country music acts would be booked into areas where they could perform covert operations for the Agency, mostly in the nature of drug running operations. On one cocaine run to Hot Springs, Arka nsas, in 1979, O'Brien reports that she met Bill Clinton, wh o had a nose full of cocaine and used \"standard Jesuit hand sign als and cryptic language,\" by which he controlled O'Brien. O'Brien says she met Wayne Cox, whom she would soon marry, in Nashville. Cox was a member of alleged \"C IA operative\" Jack Greene's Desperado Band. Cox, she a lleges, is an occult-involved serial killer who would dismembe r victims and sell their body parts to satanists through an u nderground distributor. O'Brien says that \"During the months I was back with Cox, a muscle in my upper vaginal wall was cut and dropped in preparation for [Alex] Houston to flesh carve a hideous witch's face for Senator Byrd's perversions .\" In 1980, O'Brien's daughter Kelly was born, accordi ng to her only to be shunted directly into the MONARCH progra m of prostitution and mind control. In the 1980s O'Brien says she received MONARCH programming from the Temple of Set's Colonel Michae l Aquino, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort McLellen in Annist on, Alabama; and Redstone Arsenal and Marshall Space Flight Cent er in Huntsville, Alabama; the latter programming in whic h \"NASA cooperated fully.\" During the 1980s O'Brien claims she was working as a mind- controlled courier, running messages to and transpo rting drugs from such individuals as Senator Byrd, Baby Doc Duv alier, drug lord Jose Busto, Ronald Reagan, and others. Ronald Reagan used the nifty device of programming her to respond to c ertain colors, and when he wanted her to perform a certain act or shift into a particular personality, all he had to do was hand her one of the colored jelly beans out of the jar on his de sk. O'Brien says that in one operation she relayed from Vice President Bush to Vice President Salinas the \"initi al diplomatic groundwork for the North American Free Trade Agreem ent (NAFTA).\" While under the control of George Bush, O 'Brien reports, Bush claimed to be a space alien and used hologram technology to transform his features into a lizard. Coal to Newcastle. 295"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Another of O'Brien's mind-controlled missions, she says, was to deliver Education 2000 materials for Canadian Pr ime Minister Brian Mulroney to implement. According to O'Brien, she was also utilized as a sex slave at the Bohemian Grove compound in Northern California. She describes various rooms at the compound prepared for the prominent sex freaks of d ifferent persuasions who frequented the place. In the loose-knit communities and publications of c onspiracy politics research and the patriot movement, many ta ke Phillips and O'Brien's story as gospel. Of course, many also take Serge Monast's Blue Beam story, space alien Hatonn's chan nellings in Contact magazine, \"the Photon Belt,\" the Roswell al ien saucer crash, Candy Jones, the MJ-12 \"document,\" Commander X, Bill Cooper, the Spear of Destiny, and any number of oth er shady propositions as being truth, as well. The human rac e, by and large, is not that intelligent, methinks. I remember one woman at a local patriot coffee Matc h—a \"Meet, eat, and retreat\" group, as Jack McLamb desc ribed it—asking me what I thought of O'Brien's MONARCH al legations. I told her that although I am not omniscient, due t o the lack of proof and the wild nature of her claims, that I dou bted that MONARCH existed. The woman looked at me like I had suddenly used a hologram to transform my features i nto those of a lizard. Doubting any story of evil perpetrated by the government was ample reason to believe that I was a member of the Other Side. So what is the basis of Cathy O'Brien's story about being a MONARCH slave, and Mark Phillips' tale of deprogram ming her? Truth is often stranger than fiction, and it is rem otely—think in terms of millions of light years distant—possible t hat O'Brien and Phillips are telling the truth. More likely, in my opinion, is that they are telling partly truth, partly lies or delus ion. O'Brien may have been the victim of massive abuse during her li fe. But most likely is that the whole convoluted crazy story is delusion or consciously made up. My reasons for believing this, aside from the overall improbability of her lurid account, fol low. O'Brien states that MONARCH mind control conferred photographic memory on her, thus making it possible for her to remember verbatim the conversations of the persons in her book. What she pointedly does not remember is even a single date by which the presence and activities of promin ent or not- so-prominent persons could be connected, verified, or disproved in her anecdotal accounts. She attributes this to the \"timeless\" condition of being mind-controlled, b ut if she was 296"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"that \"timeless,\" it is my belief that she would not have been able to make a single appointment, catch a single airpla ne or boat, remember her daughter's birth date (which she does at one point), or even remember what decade these alleged events transpired in. Additionally, while O'Brien remembers quite a bit o f realistic- sounding detail about homespun scenes in places lik e Muskegon, Wisconsin, her powers of description utte rly fail her when she is talking about the layout of Air Force b ases, the tech- nology of mind control laboratories, the top secret compounds of high level politicos, and offices and other inte riors in Washington, D.C. I would think that there would be a wealth of detail there, if the accounts were true, but there is not. Also, there is not one incident of high level polit ical chicanery that she mentions that could not have bee n surmised from published accounts, nor are there any unknown secretive dealings that could be verified independently—not o ne that I can find. The prominent political figures are solitary on the MONARCH stage, with almost all subsidiary character s—aides, secretaries, friends, wives, hangers-on—anonymous o r completely absent. O'Brien's remembrance of what to ok place amongst the high and mighty, figures like Bush, Rea gan, and Noriega, is oddly all common knowledge in the news and the literature of conspiracy theory—in fact, very commo n knowledge. All of her \"insider\" information is confined to pri mitive diatribes about the New World Order, NAFTA, and Edu cation 2000, the kind of half-baked pabulum that anyone co uld pick up with a cursory reading of some of the popular title s in conspiracy research. Finally, there seems to have been some collaboratio n on the accounts of both Phillips and O'Brien, or perhaps a third person working over both manuscripts. Although O'Brien is a far superior writer to her \"deprogrammer\" husband, they both have an identically weird usage of parentheses, as well as a misunderstanding of the spelling of the same words. Example: the use of \"peaked\" when they mean \"piqued.\" One could speculate long and hard on the truth abou t Trance Formation of America. Was O'Brien actually abused a nd prostituted and, under hypnosis, did she dub in a g reat deal of extraneous material involving the rich and satanic? Is it a purposeful hoax hatched by Phillips and O'Brien for the purpose of selling books? A ploy written to make actual CIA and cult mind control appear ridiculous?

Another \"tell-all\" book about MONARCH mind control is the encyclopediac vanity-published The Illuminati Formu la Used to Create an Undetectable Total Mind Controlled Slave, by Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler. Springmeier is a Chr istian minister, a certified graphoanalyst, and reported t o me in a brief telephone conversation that he has spent several ye ars deprogramming alleged MONARCH victims. Wheeler, \"si nce 1986... has been a recovering victim of mind contro l. She was part of a group of Illuminati hierarchy members tha t rebelled against their slavery... Her father was an Illumina ti Grand Master as well as one of the better programmers.\" When I spoke to Springmeier he explained to me that his books should be at the top of the New York Times be stseller lists, seeing as how they reveal the most horrible secret of the 20th century. He also explained that he had spent o ne-half- million hours deprogramming mind control victims. O dd that so much of his research would be cursory, given tha t dedication. The book is, in fact, poorly written, and loaded wi th misspellings. I would forgive those shortcomings if there was any real research, but the historical sections of t he book are a rehash of the standard works on mind control like B owart's Operation Mind Control, and a retelling of lurid ev angelist exposes of the \"I was a 33rd degree Illuminati high priest\" sort. Uninformed conspiracy theorizing is coupled with pa ge after page of unverified \"Illuminati\" codes, details on m ind control bases (they allege Area 51 in Nevada is one of thes e, where an estimated 2,000,000 Monarch slaves have been progra mmed), analyses of movies and television programs as purve yors of Monarch codes, and a hodgepodge of other things inc luding reprinted pages from a Star Trek \"technical manual\" alleged to be used for programming. The book is primarily 468 pages of poorly rehashed mind control history, allegations, and hearsay, no doubt culled from transcripts of the persons Springmeier says that he has deprogrammed. And again, is what Springmeier and Wh eeler say totally bogus? There is nothing verifiable, oth er than the well-worn stories that the co-authors have culled f rom the work of others. Nothing in this huge \"Illuminati Formula \" is proven, nothing whatsoever is verified.

But with the undocumented way that the book is done, th ere is no way of telling if any of the material that Wheeler and Springmeier presents is true. The single most telling detail suggesting that MONA RCH is a hoax or a product of delusion is that the term itse lf does not appear in any intelligence agency document, or in t he statements of any bonafide intelligence agent that I am aware of. Nor do any of the other MONARCH buzzphrases that ar e so handily tossed about by \"experts\" on the subject. T here is no corroboration of MONARCH terms in any verified inte lligence agency documents that I am aware of, nor by any act ual defectors from the intelligence community, of which there are many. I am not saying that cultic abuse and murder and mi nd control do not take place in the world, I know they do. I am not saying that men like Michael Aquino, Anton LaVey, L ouis Jolyon West, and prominent politicians may not be involved in this kind of activity—some of them are. What I am saying is t hat understanding what is really going on is ill-served by MONARCH faddists and conspiracy freaks who, having seen som ething in print once, believe it forever, or who cannot tell the difference between truth and imagination, and cannot separate out fact from urban legend, or memory from hypnotic fantasie s. For all I know, MONARCH may even exist roughly in t he way that persons like Phillips, O'Brien, Wheeler, and S pringmeier have described. But their documentation and analysi s is not up to proving it. And it is perfectly apparent that if they deal with the content of mind control trauma in the same way that they handle the conspiracy research they cite whose sour ces I am quite familiar with, then their abilities as deprog rammers as well as writers and researchers should be doubted. The answer to the O'Brien-Phillips-Wheeler-Springme ier school of conspiracy research is, of course, compil ing evidence, not just hashing together allegations, fantasies, i nnuendoes, and things once heard at a revival meeting. But that wo uld seemingly ruin the fun.

Dollars, most fundamentally, define the true power of the vote in this world, therefore the rich have trillions of vo tes whereas the poor may not be able to vote at all. And the votes of the rich, their dollars, are being cast in favor of totalitar ianism: they are being invested in the technology of control. The increase in the sophistication and power of tec hnology is a self-reinforcing loop that geometrically undermin es democratic impulses, as the owners consolidate thei r own interests, and continue to shape the popular will i n the image of the needs of control. For example, almost all infor mation sources available to the vast majority of the popul ace are part of the controlled media. The mind of the subordinate i n most cases is not his own. As the controllers and their corporations assimilat e all of the apparatus of society, creating new strategies for a ssimilation as they go, the individual becomes increasingly depend ent on the external functions of the controllers for his daily necessities; unless he goes along with the program, he is ejecte d from the society, usually to die. Now, new strategies of technological control bring the goal of total mind and body control into range. Now mind co ntrol implants and broadcast electromagnetics are able to not only channel messages and control into the subject's bra in, they are also able to link the brain with computers—to digit ize the subject's mind as part of a larger computerized str ucture. By 1969, it is rumored, the CIA was able to achieve direct communication between computers and the brain.

Signal flow in this case would be by sodium or calcium ions. Other s feel that artificial proteins can be constructed to carry sig nals by electron flow. Still another idea is to 'metalize' dead neur onal tissue to produce processing devices.\" Paul quotes geneticist Kevin Ulmer, of Genex Corpor ation, who states, \"The ultimate scenario is to develop a complete genetic code for the computer that would function a s a virus does, but instead of producing more virus, it would assemble a fully operational computer inside a cell.\" [2] In July 1996, information was released on research currently taking place into creation of a computer chip calle d the \"Soul Catcher 2025.\" Dr. Chris Winter and a team of scien tists at British Telecom's Martlesham Heath Laboratories, ne ar Ipswich, are developing a chip that, when placed into the sk ull behind the eye, will record all visual and physical sensat ions, as well as thoughts. According to Winter, \"This is the end of death... By combining this information with a record of the per son's genes, we could recreate a person physically, emotionally, and spiritually.\" Another of the possibilities of the chip that Winte r discussed was the downloading of an older person's entire lif e experience into a newborn child. Winter says that the first uses of the \"Soul Catche r\" will be for the military, where soldiers will be implanted to act as communications links, and an up-link to GPS (global position system) satellites. Prototypes are to be available within five years, military applications within 10 years, and f ree commercial availability in 20-30 years. It is interesting that the Martlesham Heath locatio n is located close to the area where the famous 1980 UFO inciden t took place at Woodbridge/Bentwaters.

The similarity of the name of the above-descr ibed Soul Catcher 2025 chip with the 2020 neural chip may not be coincidental, since the technology seems roughly id entical. Here is an edited text of the document, reprinted a t length because of its significant implications: CONFIDENTIAL LIMITED DISTRIBUTION ONLY LEVEL 9 COMMUNICATION 2020 NEURAL CHIP IMPLANT The control of crime will be a paramount concern in the 21st Century. We must be ready with our security product s when the demand for them becomes popular. Our Research and Development Division has been in contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the California Department of Cor rections, the Texas Department of Public Safety, and the Massachu setts Department of Correction to run limited trials of t he 2020 neural chip implant. We have established representa tives of our interests in both management and institutional leve l positions within these departments. Federal regulations do not yet permit testing of im plants on prisoners, but we have entered into contractual tes ting of our products. We have also had major successes in priva tely owned sanitariums with implant technology. We need, howev er, to expand our testing to research how effective the 20 20 neural chip implant performs in thos identified as the mos t aggressive in our society. Limited testing has produced a numb er of results. In California, several prisoners were identified as members of the security threat group, EME, or Mexican Mafia. T hey were brought to the health services unit at Pelican Bay and tranquilized with advanced sedatives developed by o ur Cambridge, Massachusetts laboratories. The implant procedure takes 60-90 minutes depending upon the experience o f the technician. We are working on a device which will r educe that time by as much as 60%. The results of implants on 8 prisoners yielded the following: —Implants served as surveillance monitoring device for threat group activity 303"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"—Implants disabled two subjects during an assault o n correctional staff —Universal side-effects in all 8 test subjects reve aled that when the implant was set to 116 MHz all subjects be came lethargic and slept an average of 18-22 hours per d ay —All subjects refused recreation periods for 14 day s during the 116 MHz test evaluation —7 of the 8 subjects did not exercise, in the cell or out of the cell, and 5 of the 8 subjects refused showers up to three days at a time —Each subject was monitored for aggressive activity during the test period and the findings are conclusive tha t 7 out of the 8 test subjects exhibited no aggression, even when provoked —Each subject experienced only minor bleeding from the nose and ears 48 hours after the implant due to ini tial adjustment —Each subject had no knowledge of the implant for t he test period and each implant was retrieved under the gui se of medical treatment It should be noted that the test period was for les s than two months. However, during that period, substantial da ta was gathered by our research and development team which suggets that the implants exceed expected results. One of t he major concerns of Security and the R & D team was that the test subject would discover the chemical imbalance durin g the initial adjustment period and the test would have to be scr ubbed. However, due to advanced technological developments in the sedatives administered, the 48-hour adjustment peri od can be attributed to prescription medicatio given to the t est subjects after the implant procedure. One of the concerns raised by R & D was the cause o f the bleeding and how to eliminate that problem. Unexpla ined bleeding might cause the subject to inquire further about his \"routine\" visit to the infirmary or other health ca re facility. The security windfall from the brief test period wa s enormous. Security officials now know several strat egies employed by the EME that facilitate the transmissio n of illegal drugs and weapons into their correctional facilitie s.

[Dated 20 October 1995, with distribution marked \"E yes Only: Project Group 7A\"] After reading the above paper, I wondered if it was a factual leaked memorandum or an all-too-common disinformati on ploy concocted by some zealous anti-mind control activis t. It was only after discovering corroborative information th at the scale tipped in my mind toward it being factual. That is, \"Vision 2020: Colorado Courts of the Future\", dated March 2 0, 1992, and originating from the Colorado State Judicial Sy stem. The Vision 2020 Project, or at least one compartment of it, was the result of evaluations of the proposal of implementi ng electronic implants by 80 prominent citizens of Colorado. The citizens came out in favor of the proposal. According to Vision 2020, \"biological and chemical technologies will explode in the next thirty years as rapidly as electronic technologies. We will be able to use gen etic engineering, chemicals and chip implants to change human behavior. This will raise several questions regardi ng the extent to which the state can 'reprogram' individuals beca use of their societally unacceptable behavior... these advances in technology will occur...\" The ultimate conclusion of the docum ent is that \"new treatment methods and sentencing alternatives should be utilized.\" Additional confirmation of the 2020 document is the fact that mind control experimentation is still going on at V acaville, as the document states. This was confirmed in July of 1995, when it was announced that three inmates at Vacaville ha d died in non-air conditioned cells. The announcement indicat ed that two of the prisoners may have died due to the \"medi cal\" treatment they were receiving at the time. The me dical facility, 305"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"however, revealed that the so-called medical treatm ents were in fact behavior modification treatments. [4] And so we have reached a culmination. Surfers of the informational moment are hanging ten on the most awesome cybernetic tsunami ever conceived, bar relling through an electronic womb-net of human culture, ro cking and buffeted but unsensing of the farther shore ahead. As the denizens of Tavistock have commented repeate dly, the structures and thinking patterns of the Industrial Age are breaking up, and breaking in on the conceptual edge of the Information Age. This transition is an alchemical c hange without equivalence in recorded history. There are no viable analogies other than, perhaps, the discovery of the uses of fire, and in fact the only available and most insightful analogies are being provided by madmen whose addled cortexes are the nearest thing to the mental equipment necessary to compre- hend the current changes. The reason that the information floodgates have bee n allowed to be opened is that the castles of the conspiracy are well defended by underlings, and that, secondarily, the controllers are benumbed by the excess of centuries. Free acces s to information and to the future will be a temporary t hing unless we use this moment well. Now we return to H.G. Wells, who had so much to say about the Things to Come. There may be a long-term strate gy involved in the computerization of the world and the creatio n of the Internet, which can be discerned by referencing Wel ls, in a speech before a Round Table front, the Royal Instit ute of International Affairs, in November, 1936, when he s poke of something called the \"World Encyclopaedia.\" Wells said: \"At first the realization of the ineffectiveness of our best thought and knowledge struck only a few people, lik e Mr. Maynard Keynes, for example... It is science and no t men of science that we want to enlighten and animate our p olitics and rule the world... I want to suggest that something, a new social organization, a new institution—which for a time I shall call World Encyclopaedia... This World Encyclopaedia wou ld be the mental background of every intelligent man in the w orld... Such an Encyclopaedia would play the role of an undogmat ic Bible to World culture. It would do just what our scattered and disoriented intellectual organizations of today fal l short of doing. It would hold the world together mentally... It wou ld compel men to come to terms with one another... It is a su per university I am thinking of, a World Brain; no less... Ulti mately, if our 306"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"dream is realized, it must exert a very great influ ence upon everyone who controls administrations, makes wars, directs mass behavior, feeds, moves, starves and kills popu lations... You see how such an Encyclopaedia organization could sp read like a nervous network, a system of mental control about t he globe, knitting all the intellectual workers of the world through a common interest and cooperating unity and a growing sense of their own dignity, informing without pressure or pr opaganda, directing without tyranny.\" Wells was more candid about mind control in an unpu blished memo, penned November 30, 1936: \"The Universities and the associated intellectual organizations throughout the world should function as a police of the mind.\" Certainly all of this sounds science fictional—you know, The Time Machine and War of the Worlds, and all that—bu t we are at that stage where it has suddenly become real. It was during the Nixon administration that a 300-p age White House \"Administratively Confidential\" report, prepa red by John Erlichman of Watergate fame, proposed putting a gov ernment radio in every home in the United States. Although the system would ostensibly be used as an emergency warning sy stem, the report also suggested that the radios could be used to educate preschoolers for world citizenship, and to propagan dize to offset social unrest. But the report went farther, and in retrospect prov ides some insight into what is going on today. According to t he report, the government radios would be part of a \"wired nation\" system that would also act as a computer clearinghouse, localiz ing all the nation's police and health records in one giant dat abank. [5] And, of course, this is only the tip of the electro nic iceberg. Given the advances in computing and electronic cont rol over the past several decades, it is apparent that the most science fictional possibilities for worldwide mind control are here, or at least only around the corner. Given technologies fo r the broadcasting of thought via electromagnetics, for \" synthetic telepathy,\" it is not at all unlikely that there co uld soon be a worldwide network of satellites providing, not only surveillance, but total mind control, broadcasting thoughts, mood s emotions. These satellites could hang in geosynchronous orbit , manipulating we marionettes in whatever fashion mig ht be desired.
