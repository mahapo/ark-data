[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"58     New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 In summer 1988, an entomologist from Novosibirsk city, Viktor Stepanovich Grebennikov, examined a micro\u0001structure of the lower surface of beetles’ wing case by a microscope and became interested by “an unusually rhythmic, extremely ordered, incomparable honeycomb, solid multidimensional composition, which looked as if it was pressed by some complicated automatic machine”. Studying this amazing micro\u0001pattern allowed Grebennikov to design an aircraft of a new kind called “Gravity plane”. As usually, this discovery was made by chance. Once Grebennikov put a chitin bristle from some beetle’s shell under a microscope and wanted to put another one but it slipped out from tweezers and... hung in the air. Then the scientist tied some laminae together from the top by a wire arranging them vertically. It was impossible to put even a thumbtack on this block because it was thrown up and then aside. When the thumbtack was forcefully fixed to the chitin block from the top, it was lifted and, for a moment, completely disappeared! Grebennikov discovered a bio\u0001antigravity effect in 1988 and then, during 3 years, studied it from many sides, developed the platform’s designs, carried out experiments. Together with Professor V. Zolotarev, he sent a patent application. Finally, in 1991, Grebennikov built his gravity\u0001plane and started flying by a noiseless aircraft, which reached a speed of 1,500\u00012,400 km/hour. The aircraft was inertialess and almost invisible from below. People, who observed it from ground, saw, instead of it, a light sphere or a disc or a cloud with sharply outlined edges. It is unnecessary to say that this was discovered not yesterday but in 1980ies. Grebennikov tried to rouse interest of “real” scientists but it was useless. Nobody wanted to talk to him. In An anti-gravity platform of V.S. Grebennikov We publish materials from http://gragons-matrix.narod.ru. The site’s author writes under the pseudonym of Dragon’s Lord. His ideas are interesting enough for an inquisitive reader to analyze them. Fig. 1. Viktor Stepanovich Grebennikov Fig. 2. A wing and a wing case of Cetonia.

A book called “My world” written by him in 1997 remained. There is a full variant of the book in Internet at http://bronzovka.narod.ru. Grebennikov studied an effect of cavitary structures of insects. He gave this name to a mysterious radiation emanated from their nests. In chapter 5\u00011 of the book, Grebennikov writes: «I have only a handful of old clay lumps, fragments of these nests, with numerous small rooms\u0001cells. The cells were located side by side and looked like small thimbles or, more likely, small jugs with smoothly narrowing beaks. I’ve already knew that these bees belonged to species of Halictus – according to the number of light rings on their oblong bellies. There was a wide vessel filled with these spongy clay lumps on my working table, which was jammed with instruments, ant and grasshopper houses, vials with chemical agents and other things. I had to take something and I brought my hand above these spongy fragments. And a miracle happened: I suddenly felt heat above them... I touched the lumps by the hand – they were cold. But I obviously felt heat above them. Moreover, I felt unknown pushes, bounce, “tick” in my fingers”. This radiation cannot be screened. Grebennikov wrote: “I put a piece of cardboard on top – the feelings were the same. I put a pan’s lid but it had no effect: this “something” ran through the barrier. I should immediately study this phenomenon. But the instruments did not react Fig. 3. Grebennikov’s flying platform"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"60     New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 at all: neither finest thermometers, nor ultrasound recorders, electrometers nor magnetometers. But usual human hands (and not only mine hands!) obviously felt either heat or cold wind or ticks or a denser medium above the nests. Some people’s hands became heavier, other people’s hands were pushed up; some people’s fingers grew numb, fore arm’s muscles felt spasms, some people felt giddy, secreted saliva voluminously”. But how did V. Grebennikov came to the idea of his aircraft? Let us read further: “In summer 1988, I watched by microscope chitin shells of insects, their fleecy antennae, butterfly wings’ lamellae of finest structure, open\u0001work of shad mooneye’s wings with bright play and other Natural Patents. I was interested in an unusually rhythmic micro\u0001structure of some parts of rather big insects. This was an extremely ordered composition, which looked as if it had been pressed by some complicated automatic machine according to special designs and calculations. In my opinion, this incomparable cellular structure was necessary neither for strength nor for decoration of this part. I did not notice something even resembling such an unusual amazing micro\u0001pattern neither on other insects’ parts nor in the rest of nature, nor in technology nor in art. Due to the fact that it was multi\u0001dimensional, I could not copy it in a flat drawing or a photograph. Why does an insect have this? This structure is located in the bottom of wing cases and is almost always hidden. It can be seen only when an insect flies but who can do this? I suspected that this can be a wave beacon having “my” effect of multi\u0001cavitary structures. During this really happy summer, there were a lot of insects of this species and I caught them using light in the evenings. Neither before nor after that, I observed neither such a great number of them or even single individuals. I put a small concave chitin lamella on a microscope table in order to watch its strange cells using strong magnification once more. I looked at a regular masterpiece of Nature\u0001 jeweler and, without any purpose, put another lamella with these unusual cells located on one of its sides on the first lamella by tweezers. But the part was pulled out the tweezers, hung in the air for some seconds under the lamella, which lay on the microscope table, rotated clockwise, moved – in the air! \u0001 to the right, rotated anticlockwise, swung and only then quickly fall on the table. A reader can only imagine what I felt that moment... After coming to consciousness, I tied some lamellae by a piece of wire. It was difficult and possible only if I took them vertically. So, I made a kind of a multilayer chitin “block”. I put it on a table. Even such a comparatively heavy thing as a thumbtack could not lie on it: something pulled it up and then aside. I fixed the thumbtack to the top of the “block” and then so unbelievable things began to happen (particularly, the thumbtack completely disappeared for a moment) that I understood that this is not a beacon but some Other thing. I was excited again and, due to agitation, everything around me was like in mist; but I could calm down and, in two hours, could continue working... Everything began from this accident.” Fig. 4.

Multi-cell structures of insects magnified by an electronic microscope by hundreds and thousands times Fig. 5. “These strange, extraordinary fine and complex instruments and devices of insects are used not only for senses of touch, smell, vision, sound but they also receive or generate electronic waves while some of them hamper the Earth’s gravity.

However, if we remember Grebennikov’s remark: “... I did not notice something even resembling such an unusual amazing micro\u0001pattern neither on other insects’ parts nor in the rest of nature, nor in technology nor in art ...”. Usual hexagon honeycombs can be observed. Or does Grebennikov want to say that honeycombs (as in experiments on production of the effect of cavitary structures \u0001 ECS) are a simplified example of this complicated pattern and the antigravity effect can be observed already in such a simple structure? Here are more photographs of honeycombs: These are the only photographs in the book, where “... strange stellate cells ...” can be seen. Possibly, it is the construction’s prototype. At least, this is something very close. We can suppose that these are honeycombs (on micro\u0001level) and an element with a star consisting of multi\u0001layer mesh of cells is formed. Just like on the photographs."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"62     New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 And, in two years of laborious work, a gravity plane shown on Fig. 3 appeared: an aircraft with amazing characteristics. It is invisible, need no traditional engine as we imagine it, and has no wings or a propeller. It is noiseless; easily reach a safe flight speed of 1500 km/h, which is not felt by a pilot: there are no either inertia properties of a moving body or heat influence of the environmental air to the aircraft, or dynamic pressure or other effects. It also has a very simple design: a post with two handles placed on an opened platform. A detective story In 1992, in “Molodost Sibiri” newspaper, a pre\u0001 release of Grebennikov’s book “My world” was published. The photographs of Grebennikov flying by his platform were published in the article for the first time. The photographs were also published in “Tehnika molodezhi” magazine. From bad to worse, it was written in a “Tehnika molodezhi” article that total volume of the book was meant to be 500 pages and 400 colorful images. In the same article, it is written that the aircraft principles, heights and outfit will be given in “My world”. Grebennikov was going to completely describe his invention. The whole book was aimed at it. But proofreaders and an editor (and, possibly, the according authorities) explained Grebennikov that it is forbidden to publish such information. So, Grebennikov had to remove fragments of the text and patch it up. This is why a lot of hints and keys remained in the book. In order to completely remove information on the platform, he had to rewrite the whole book! Two photographs with Grebennikov’s flight were left in the book because they were already known to people. As a result, the book’s total volume was more than 300 pages and there were a lot of inappropriate butterfly images in the end of the 5th chapter”. Though Grebennikov could not publish the invention’s description, he tried to tell readers fundamentals of his inventions by hints (because, in 1990ies, he WANTED to tell this to the world and, only in 2000ies, after he became ill, he began to reduce the information considering it dangerous for people’s health). In the “Tehnika molodezhi” article, it was written that Grebennikov had demonstrated his platform in a museum (in Siberian Research Institute of Agriculture and Agricultural Chemistry) FOR EVERYONE! Possibly, a big colorful photograph of the aircraft was taken in the museum. If it is so, there must be eye\u0001 witnesses who saw the aircraft. There must be a lot of them. A real device was made in one copy and disappeared after Grebennikov’s death. However, in the mentioned above museum, a model of the device made by Grebennikov remained. Actually, only the post remained. The board was stolen, the post was roughly pulled out, all plaster wing nuts were broken – apparently, they tried to untwist them! Everything – buttons, toggle, right handle of the handle bar – was made of playdough, plaster and papier\u0001mache and then covered with silver paint. Grebennikov obviously tried to reproduce an appearance of the real device with maximal accuracy because it is much easier to use real wings nuts in the model. In this case, however, plaster copies were made using the real board. It is a pity that the lower part of the platform, i.e. the board, was lost. It could contain copies of block\u0001boards’ parts and mirrored a real scheme of kinematic blind control. If we could look at the control scheme, it would be possible to remove many versions considering antigravity production principle. A range of questions would narrow... The device A fine analysis of a possible design of Grebennikov’s platform is published at http:// dragon\u0001matrix.narod.ru/ (it is not real but a supposed design). The platform’s post (the handle bar) The first handle bar’s section is a T\u0001shaped welded construction with a lot of buttons, signal indicators (light\u0001emitting diodes) and even an electrical toggle. The instrument at the handle bar’s center is an altitude meter. An electrical snap\u0001action (two\u0001position) toggle (5) is used for turning on board electrical equipment (signal light\u0001emitting diodes) and,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"63 New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 Fig. 7. A scheme of elements of the first (upper) post’s elbow possibly, additionally, for “permission” of motor device operation process. At the left of the altitude meter, opposite to the toggle, the electrical button\u0001starter (3) is located. Grebennikov pushed it when the device still stood on the ground (right before take\u0001off). Pushing the button, a condenser plate in the motor device is charged by a high potential. On the end of the left handle, another light\u0001 emitting diode (1 – traditionally, it is called “green”, in order to distinguish it). It shows charge presence on the motor device’s condenser plate and, possibly, a charge degree of the plate (by different brightness of glow). In the opposite direction, on the end of the right handle, two light\u0001emitting diodes are placed: red (8) and white (7). They are directly connected to plug\u0001and\u0001sockets placed in mechanical units of joining\u0001separation and change of blinds’ tilting. The white light\u0001emitting diode induces straight motion while the red one induces quick slowdown. Left rotary handle (2) controls blinds separation with increase of an active surface – a vertical traction. The right one (6) controls change of rotation angle of every blinds’ plate around the long axis – a horizontal traction. Two mechanical buttons\u0001catchers (14, 9) directed at a pilot’s belly are placed lower than the toggle and the button\u0001starter. They are connected to the rotary arms according to “push and turn” principle. In order to turn the arm, it is necessary to press an according button by a thumb (to release the arm’s motion) and then it is possible to rotate it freely pressing the button. If you stop pressing the button, the arm will stay fixed in the existing position (with the given angle). This helps to carry out the hovering mode and choose a fixed height and flight speed (during a long flight time). All other “convex” elements located at the first handle bar’s elbow are retention screws. There are no control and diagnostics elements except the mentioned ones. The most interesting thing is that the upper (right) handle bar’s section TURNS like a handle bar of a standard bike (!) controlling a mechanism of the platform rotation (unsynchronism of the symmetric block\u0001boards’ rotation). A rotary effort is transferred by a flexible elastic cable (with a diameter of about 10 mm). The biggest screw on the handle bar (13) located under the altitude meter in the center is a bonding of this cable. Bonding of the whole post to the platform, this rotary cable is set into a central socket (the biggest one on the photograph,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"64     New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 where Grebennikov keeps his suitcase). “Loosening screw\u0001nuts on the control post, I shorten it like an antenna of a radio set, and take it (Grebennikov means this cable) out of the platform, which is folded in two, due to joints”. By the way, the handle bar could rotate. Near a bolt of the rotary cable bonding, a cramp is stuck (10). Grebennikov tied himself to it with a belt. The second elbow is not interesting because it is a standard pipe. It is only necessary to mention that it does NOT rotate together with the first one but is fixed to the third elbow, which, for its turn, is screwed to the fourth immovable elbow. A wing nut on the first elbow (11) DOES NOT ATTACH the first elbow to the second one. Instead, it holds a special bushing, which helps the handle bar to turn. There is a button directed to a pilot on the third elbow. It is not a light emitting diode but a button because Grebennikov painted it the same brown paint as the post. Who would paint light emitting diodes which do not light bright? The use of this button will remain unknown, perhaps. And we will not know how the wing nut on the forth elbow was used (it is located in the center and directed to a pilot). The forth elbow ends by perpendicular flange (25, with three bolts), which decreases the “pull out” moment. The lower elbow cannot rotate because a device of the lower side rotary arm is stuck to it. A body of the device (17) is a CYLINDRICAL pipe section (it is stuck to the post horizontally). A free end of the body is cut with an angle of about 40 degrees and closed by round plate\u0001stub (16) with three small screws. There is a hole in the stub’s center, where our handle (15) protrudes from. The handle is spring\u0001loaded and has a mechanical nature. It is necessary to pay attention to rod (18) starting from the handle’s body to the control box. Actually, this is a hollow pipe, where either a cable or a rod with a bolt head (at the bottom) slides. When the handle is turned against a pilot, it is impossible to fly. If it is turned to a pilot, it is possible to fly. There is an adjusting element (26) on the upper handle’s surface. It looks like a small cylinder with a horizontal metal rod, which is used for Fig. 8.

A bottom view of the platform (the picture from “My world book”). The design of the back blinds-fans can be seen. its rotation. It adjusts accuracy of the connection\u0001disconnection mechanism’s operation (by pulling up the cable or somehow else). Most likely, the handle is a standard protecting device, which blocks accidental operation of the platform’s antigravity devices without a pilot. Now let us discuss a small box in the bottom of the post. Four wing nuts (19, 24) located on the upper surface of the box fix the post to the platform. Two side (opposite) wing nuts (20, 23) adjust accuracy of “distributors” operation (accuracy of bringing together and synchronization of the blinds). There are two “distributors”: the left one is used for separating the blinds and the right one is used for change of the blinds’ angle. Each mechanical “distributor” of the efforts (located horizontally) is connected to a cable from each of the rotary arms of the handle bar. Then, efforts are distributed to several cables, to each of four blinds’ blocks. There is a treadle (22) in the box from the pilot’s side for the right foot. Its function is quick slowdown (and also standard slowdown). Another electrical snap\u0001action toggle is located near the treadle (at the left of it). It has bright orange color and either made of transparent plastic and lit from inside by a light emitting diode or made of an opaque material and painted by a fluorescent paint (with phosphorus or something like this). Why is it painted? It is made so due to the fact that it is used only at night, i.e. under conditions of limited illumination. What does it control? A small headlight is placed on the right side of the box (like a reflector of a flash\u0001light). It turns the headlight on. A flash\u0001light lamp is used. It is connected through a resistor to a small accumulator hidden in the same box at the handle bar’s base (it is an analogue of “Krona” battery of 9 Volt; it has the same size but it is cylindrical). It is necessary to mention that such an accumulator can supply all light emitting diodes, headlights and a high\u0001voltage transformer and charge the condenser plates in the motion device for a couple of weeks of continuous operation (at least, it will be enough for a rather long time). It can also be charged at home. The headlight can be used during take\u0001off and landing and is useless during flight due to two reasons. First, there is nothing to light in the sky. Second, if the platform’s irradiators have sufficient power, the platform becomes invisible and stops light from going out of its field’s limits. Besides, it is difficult to ACCIDENTALLY step on and break the toggle glowing in the dark because it is placed not very well."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"66     New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 The platform’s base Grebennikov made his airplane of a platform, so numerous screws and wing nuts are just lightly modified platform’s parts. Each of the platform halves was made by Grebennikov of ONE wooden piece while industrially produced platforms are made of plywood with attached boards. But this is a box of old Soviet microscope package with an external walls’ thickness of 8 mm and an internal walls’ thickness of about 50 mm. Grebennikov only had to take out a plastic foam interlay and cover the body with drying oil. He made this though the board’s thickness of 8 mm is rather unreliable. Possibly, Grebennikov strengthened the base by sheet metal from inside. Blinds (block\u0001boards) The blinds’ design is a standard FAN made of flat long elements. There are four fans. Each of their four axles is fixed vertically at the platform’s corners. It can be seen in photographs. Even a picture by Grebennikov showing its device from below exists! Two bolt heads can also be seen on the photographs, approximately in the center of each platform halves. This is a bonding of the distribution mechanism, which transfers effort from the “distributors” to a fan opening device. Each fan consists of nine plates. In order to make them strong, the plates are made of sheet metal. Micro\u0001nets are stuck from the upper surface of each plate. On the one hand, the metal does not prevent nets from operating because the effect of cavitary structures cannot be screened and, on the other hand, protects them from mechanical influences such as influence of grass during landing. Holes in the plates, which can be seen, are not related to micro\u0001cells. They are made only for lightening the metal plates’ weight. Do you see that it is difficult for Grebennikov to hold even a lightened version of his platform? Antigravity effect (created due to the effect of cavitary structures) is produced by the cells but they need “fuel” in order to work with maximal efficiency. Roughly speaking, the effect of cavitary structures works the following way: any material consists of particles vibrating by its own frequency (read Tesla’s cosmology, works of John Keely, Thomas Henry Morey, Wilhelm Reich and others). Due to such internal atomic vibrations, a stationary wave exists in the environment, around any object (and further, discrete “reflections” or maximums of such a wave). Thus, a frequency and length of such vibration are unique for any material (according to Grebennikov, this is a “reflection of de Broglie waves). If we make a cavity, its walls will begin to “radiate” towards each other or under some angles. If a right size of such a cell will be found, waves’ maximums will sum up and a field will be strengthened in the given point of space (field antinode). So, let us make conclusions. First, as many as possible surfaces are necessary for one cell (it may seem strange but a polygon with maximal quantity of sides, which can be used for filling a plane without gaps and fractally is a hexagon). Second, the less the size of each cell, the more quantity of surfaces, which we can have with the same volume. The more cells and, accordingly, the more surfaces, the stronger the effect of cavitary structures. Let us remark more that size of one cell is not arbitrary but divisible by wave “reflections” (maximums’ position), which, in their turn, depend on a used material. Wave “reflections” can be far from the surface as well as very close to it. Closer ones have stronger power. So, we have a very fine net. By specifying a certain geometry of its cells (size and form of planes, angles between the planes), we concentrate our STATIC field (the material’s “radiation”) in certain points of space. However, we are interested, first of all, in force GRADIENT. The mentioned static field does not produce yield and confirms the law of energy conservation. We don’t have antigravity so far. Then we use lepton theory of Isakov (remember that lepton, aether, and orgone are the same). We have to determine such a form of cells, which will allow having different field force: from a"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"67 New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 very low on the one side to a very high on another. The less distance to the cell material surface, the stronger wave “reflections” we have. We make a simple and logical conclusion that one side of the cell must be geometrically less than another. If an initial cell is cylindrical, we have a cone: if it is triangular or square, we have a pyramid with a triangular or square base. If we initially have a hexagonal cell, the pyramid will be hexagonal too. It is necessary to tell about lepton explanation of gravity effect. This means that leptons fly all over space in all directions, chaotically. They pass through all bodies but still they transmit some (very small) part of their speed to these bodies. Now imagine two spheres. A lepton stream flying from one sphere to another passes through the first sphere, brakes and “irradiates” the second sphere less than the first one (the second sphere is in “lepton shadow” of the first one). And on the contrary. Thus, pressure from the direction of the internal space (between the spheres) will be less than the external pressure, which leads to attraction (i.e. pushing together) of two bodies. This effect is called gravity. So, we need antigravity. There are leptons or aether everywhere in universe. If a device will be invented, which will be able to change leptons’ direction to the necessary one (create aether wind), our task will be solved. We already have such a device – this is our cell. A cell of the conic (or cuneiform) kind takes up a lepton stream from the horizontal direction (it will become obvious after we read Wilhelm Reich’s works in the attachment) and reapportion it to the vertical one: a small part of the stream goes in one direction while almost the whole stream goes in another. Of course, if the cell’s axis is placed vertically as in Grebennikov’s platform. Now, if we place such a solid net consisting of the micro\u0001cells under the platform (in a zone BETWEEN the bodies, i.e. between the Earth and the platform with a man) and orient it in such a way that “aether wind”, which is created by it, blows the platform from the bottom compensating insufficiency of lepton pressure (as described above), the platform and its passenger will become imponderable and fly up. Controlling a power of an aether stream and its directions (the blinds are used for this), we have the same rough material idea of force vector as in the case of jet streams. The only difference is that aether is so insensible for us that there are no strong air streams. At first sight, there is nothing! The platform just picks up speed and height without any sound, visual and other effects. Inertia force doesn’t influence a pilot. It is necessary to note that a head is heavier than legs while the legs, in their turn, are heavier than the platform – it is a gradient of the antigravity force! It is interesting that it is possible to make symmetric cells (like usual honeycombs) instead of cuneiform ones. A half of this “aether wind” can blow in the ground – it s all right. It is unreasonable: about a half of the power is lost (power, however, can be increased by decreasing cells’ size by 0.5) but, technologically, such nets are easier to build. Now let us tell about the cells’ “fuel”. Grebennikov noted that, in case with the effect of cavitary structures experiments, it is necessary to take the Sun into account under normal conditions. The point is that, together with sunlight, an intensive aether (or lepton, this is the same) flow goes from the Sun. As it was noted by Grebennikov, during take\u0001off, Grebennikov’s aircraft was always carried away in a direction, which was opposite to the Sun. This happened because, from the Sun side, the fans got more effective supply and worked more effectively moving the aircraft in another direction. This is the answer. In the event when the aircraft was moved away due to different reasons, this cannon be explained by “usual conditions”. In this case, different environmental disturbances take place. We will not consider them here because these are fluctuations, which do not hamper in flying. Let us now think about electrostatics. If in all descriptions of Grebennikov’s experiments including the beetle regularity “two layers of reticular structures are more powerful than one layer” takes place, how a fact can be explained"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"68     New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 that a folded fan (a multi\u0001layer package of nets) is much WEAKER than an unfolded by Grebennikov one (i.e. place all nets in one layer)? It is obvious that power increases during fan unfolding: “Moving a handle, I unfold the blinds again and hoick vertically” or “A flexible cable inside the handle transmits motion from the left handle to the gravity blind. Folding and unfolding them, I carry out take\u0001off or landing” . What increases during the blinds’ unfolding? Right, their square increases. But not just square but a square of interaction with the second layer. It is understandable that there are no additional elements under the fans. But there is such a structure above them! Remember about the sheet metal? Why electrostatics? Various purely electrical elements are installed on the platform. It means that electricity is used. It is also known that an electrostatic field of high potential can produce yield (remember what Tesla told) and is not consumed during this. It is possible to obtain high voltage of dozens kilovolt by rather compact devices which use watch batteries. In Novosibirsk, in the 90ies, a whole kind of such devices was sold: from shokers to stimulators. Such a “box” can be easily placed in the box under the post. Pressing the button\u0001starter (the button on the left of the handle bar), the transformer turns on for a short time and the terminal’s plate located a little higher than the nets obtains a considerable static charge. The “green” diode indicates a charging degree of the terminal. The terminal cannot discharge itself, during operation, but it is slowly discharged through the air (a so called corona discharge). Thus, Grebennikov periodically had to press the mentioned button taking into account the diode’s light. It is possible to build an automatic scheme controlling this process but Grebennikov did not know radio electronics and hardly knew electrotechnology. There is only one vexed question: “What did Grebennikov show on the picture? It could be either BOTH halves of the platform or only ITS BACK half”. The first version will be asserted by supporters of a rough interpretation of the platform’s operation: a repulsive force, which is directed DOWN (vortex technologies and others). The second version is confirmed by a reasonable thought: “there are NO two internal vertical partitions, to which rotary hinges are fixed, between the fans on the picture. It means that two BACK fans are shown on the picture”. In our supposition, we consider a force directed UP and “blowing” at the platform from below. Understanding the construction this way, it is possible to explain how the brake is carried out by incline of the back couple of the fans. This is how the treadle on the platform works. Accordingly, the front fans work the same way but mirroring (creating traction in the motion direction). It is necessary to note, just in case (for military men and cosmonauts), that the incline changes not the whole fan but each separate plate. Each plate has its own axis. The left handle USUALLY works only with the back fans (It will not be surprising if two back fans will turn out to be much stronger than the front ones), i.e. creates the vertical traction. Grebennikov stands only on the back half of the platform. Make your conclusions. The right handle ALWAYS controls only the front fans, i.e. creates the horizontal traction (the while diode lights). Rotation, as it was already discussed, is transmitted mechanically by twisting a thick flexible cable. The rotary effort is transferred from the lower transmitting unit in the center of the box under the handle bar by a standard “car” method, i.e. through hard control\u0001rods with trunnion balls at their ends (but the trunnion balls can be absent) directly to “rotary” unit of the FRONT fans bonding. The back fans are not used by Grebennikov for control. This allows not transmitting all this to the back block\u0001filters. So, the back couple is mechanically simpler than the front one by one third. During flight, the fans are unfolded and, when the treadle is pressed, the treadle drive rotates the plates and hampers the platform after preliminary turning off the “gas handle” (the white diode goes out and the red one lights). The effort for the plates’ unfolding and their turn to the back fans is transmitted through flexible cables; this allows easily folding the platform. Thus, the treadle is an analogue of the right handle but for the front fans instead of the back ones."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"69 New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 Invisibility of the gravity plane A reason of a pilot’s instable invisibility described by Grebennikov is caused by four crossed fields exists instead of the place of one field’s influence. A product space is where a pilot stands. If only one field would exist, it would be stable. The fans, according to the flight mode, change radiation power and radiation direction all the time (take\u0001off/fall, acceleration/slowdown and, mainly, turn). So we just have to comment presence of the invisibility effect. Light could freely come to the “sphere” around Grebennikov (in the influence zone of the field created by the nets) but could not come back. This is why Grebennikov was invisible. He could see everything because light reached his retina. But no reflected beams came from him because the entire light (a flow of particles coming from outside) was absorbed by the process generated by the nets, i.e. light was utilized (a flow of particles bringing the “fuel” to the nets). When Grebennikov stood on the ground, he was visible because the blinds were folded and did not work (therefore, they did not absorb light or any other particles). As soon as he began to rise and increase power (increasing the fans’ square), he smoothly (not suddenly) started becoming invisible. Of course, the invisibility was full during flight and, coming back, the process was the same. This is why, when Grebennikov flew low above the ground (and generated low power), he became visible (cast shadow). The same happened during quick landing, in the “falling like a stone” mode, when the blinds were folded: he became fully visible. This is why it was possible to take a photograph of Grebennikov during take\u0001off, when he flew low. But when he flew “above pine’s tops”, it was impossible to photograph Grebennikov because there were no reflected beams from him, thus he was invisible. Humidity and electrostatics Grebennikov noticed one more detail: it was impossible to fly by the platform during rainy weather. On the one hand, actually, increased humidity does not promote electrostatics (and a bronze poplar borer flies only during sunny weather because chitin is very electrostatic; a beetle, most likely, uses the following effect: statics+ECS=strong antigravity). On the other hand, as Grebennikov wrote: “Put a shower head on a tap and turn on cold water. Slowly bring your palm to a beam of falling drops aside: most people feel heat at this moment. In fact, this is ECS increased by motion of new elements of the “multilayer net”: falling water drops and gaps between them. After training in a kitchen or in a bathroom, feel stronger ECS at fountains or waterfalls. Even if atmosphere pressure is not falling, remote rain creates a strong ECS field influencing at a distance of many kilometers. Remember how we want to sleep before rain even in a closed room: ECS cannot be screened”. Many small drops and gaps between them form a multidimensional void structure, which influences by its ECS. This, however, does not help the device based on the same principle to fly. Under the picture with the bronze poplar borer Grebennikov wrote: “When a big Middle\u0001Asia bronze poplar borer sits like that (this is live!) on a finger, the finger feels like it is pulled up”. Pay your attention: the insect is “LIVE”!!! Possibly, wing cases of a dried beetle will NOT show the repulsion effect. I repeat: possibly. What do I mean? Perhaps, the dried beetle has no sufficient static charge on its chitin and this prevents display of antigravity effect. It is also possible that statics is transmitted not by wing cases’ surface but by hemolymph (a blood type) of insects. Or maybe this is not statics but something else. As an example, here is a small fragment from Mister X’s “works” (The editor’s note: Mister X is a visitor of http://gragons\u0001 matrix.narod.ru site forum):"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"70     New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 “Once I accidentally killed a standard and not prominent ladybird (I knew about Grebennikov’s discovery from the article). I am confused to confess but I tried even laying one wing case on another but it gave no result. I had no microscope and I used a standard magnifying glass for examination of the wing cases. Even under such a small magnification I could clearly see inside thin longitudinal walls\u0001“edges”. Following mere curiosity, I crushed one of the wing case between my fingers. As a result, a red liquid flew out of it. My curiosity continues, this is why I took a standard flat battery, a lamp and a piece of cross patching. I found out an interesting fact: the liquid was a conductor. After I read the book and analyzed the pictures, it dawned upon me that we have a simplest electrolytic condenser with hemolymph (insects’ blood) as electrolyte and dielectric (chitin)!\". What an idea! The electrolytic condenser, what do you think?! In general, it is obvious that, even if we get the necessary wing cases, a lot of DIFFERENT experiments must be carried out. But how to impact properties of the “live” wing cases to the “dead” ones? Grebennikov’s platform worked; this is a fact, so it is possible to technically reproduce the effect of the “live” wing cases. The editor’s note: Here it is appropriate to remember readers about another approach to creation of engines, which is called “asymmetrical condensers”. Articles devoted to this topic have been published in our magazine. Eye\u0001witnesses As it was found out, Grebennikov hoped to remain invisible in vain. People who saw him in the sky were found. Mister X writes: “I was interested in Grebennikov’s question since an article called “Night flight over the city” had been published in “Molodost Sibiri” newspaper in 1991. A precondition was my only observation of UFO flight in the middle of March 1990. The UFO did not look like a “saucer” or an “object”. The observed object was practically the same as on the picture thought I cannot judge whether it was Grebennikov’s flight or not.” Biological hazard Grebennikov died at the age of 74. The age is venerable, but death was caused by a number of diseases, which can be obtained, for example, as a result of irradiation of a strong electromagnetic field . And Grebennikov confirmed that obtained the diseases due to flights by the platform. But a triangular bearer frame can be made of pipes, a platform can be placed in each corner of the frame and a pilot’s seat can be placed in the middle of this construction. In this case, a pilot will NEVER be in a filed of the platform’s influence. Moreover, Grebennikov mentioned that the triangular design with three elements (net platforms) is an ideal kind of control. In order to exclude a pilot’s contact with atmosphere, a hermetic cockpit is installed. It provides full comfort and safety. Questions and answers Question : Why did Grebennikov stood flying instead of, for example, sitting on the platform with his legs down and, in this case, why did not he make a shorter handle bar? Answer : Both the platform and Grebennikov was COMPLETELY in the zone of compensated gravity’s influence, i.e. their mass and, more precisely, their weight was not positive but negative, which allowed flying. If he would put his legs OUT the field’s limits, their weight would become normal again, i.e. about 30\u000140 kg. As a result, the platform would change its vertical position in space to a horizontal one due to outweigh by the appeared weight. And Grebennikov would just fall from it. In general, nothing can be put out the platform’s limits during flight. Question : Thus, it is impossible to build a device where a pilot will be OUT of the dangerous radiation of the blinds. Is it necessary to be in the field’s influence zone as Grebennikov did? Answer : No, this is a mistake. The pilot’s cockpit can be placed outside the limits of the admittedly harmful radiation. It is just necessary to have at least three independent platforms placed on the edges of such a “saucer”"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"71 New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 in the device’s construction. Besides, the blinds must be made more powerful than Grebennikov’s blinds because we will have to carry a not nullificated mass of the cockpit and a pilot placed in the center between the irradiators. Moreover, it is necessary to have an automatic stability device, which would remove list of the aircraft manipulating by powers of all three irradiators. Question : Why do cells (for example, pipes) oriented vertically “irradiate” stronger than the ones oriented horizontally (remember how Grebennikov tried to tie some wing cases together and all his experiments on ECS) if aether is everywhere? Answer : There are not sufficient quantity of aether wind in a space BETWEEN two objects in a vector’s direction from one object to another. As we see, the Earth has a huge size and, accordingly, considerably ties up a stream flowing through it. This causes its strong gravity influence on other objects. If we place any cell (pipe) horizontally, aether will be absorbed from the vertical direction through walls of such a cell. Due to the fact that a lepton flow in this case is very depressed, we obtain low efficiency. If we place any cell (pipe) vertically, aether will be absorbed from the horizontal direction. In the horizontal direction, aether winds are not “screened” (because the Earth is lower than the pipe and, for example, the platform is higher. The second object can be missing). Question : What is a “fractal principle”? Answer : Imagine standard honeycombs. We take one hexagonal cell. If it has the right size, antinodes of the ECS field from each wall of this cell must coincide exactly along the central axis (reflection of de Broglie waves), i.e. the same “maximum” of the stationary wave. We have a certain power. Let us add six cells along the circumference – it is an approximate hexagon. Antinodes of the ECS field from the newly formed EXTERNAL sides of this big hexagon will coincide again and meet in the center but these will be other reflections (stronger than the first ones observed by us). Both groups of “maximums” sum up and, as a result, we obtain a field, which is stronger than that created by all cells participating in the process and taken individually. Now we add other 12 cells along the external outline and so on. ECS maximums of different ranges will sum up all the time. This is a clear “fractal principle”. Obviously, this is why there were so many hexagons in Grebennikov’s book. Question : How can we work with micro\u0001cell nets – press them, assemble them in block\u0001 boards and install these boards to the device, \u0001 if a cell will immediately fly if we let it off? Answer : This is a widely spread mistake. The nets do not fly themselves. Only objects placed in the compensated gravity zone (above the horizontally placed nets) has weight equal to 0. Difficulties appear only at the last stage of assembling when powers of construction elements are relatively strong and influence each other. In this case, assembling the device, it is necessary to watch the nets being in the vertical position. This relates to Grebennikov: when he folded and unfolded his platform, he put it vertically (I mean the board). Question : Grebennikov could not turn at small power of the vertical traction (during take\u0001off, landing and slowdown), could he? Answer : Yes, it is because, in the event of the minimal vertical traction, the blinds are hardly unfolded. This does not allow normally turning the plates around their axes (change their incline angle). During slowdown, a drive of the “gas” handle turns off. This makes use of the handle bar useless because the plates of the front fans are placed in the horizontal plane too. Due to the fact that the back fans bore the main vertical load, it is possible that the front fans are half\u0001unfolded in their minimal position (when the right handle is not turned), which allows using the handle bar during low\u0001power flight modes. If it is not so, it is still possible to do so. It seems to me that Grebennikov did not do this because he was pulled away from the Sun and he could not fight with it and, therefore, could not manipulate the turning function during take\u0001off. Fundamentally, these details do not influence flight because motion is inertialess and, during change of reapportion of an aether wind flow, a motion vector changes at the same time."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"72     New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 Question : Could the handle bar really turn? Answer : Let us think: actually, the left handle is busy (it unfolds the blinds and creates the vertical traction); the right handle, according to the description, changes incline of the blinds’ elements (i.e. creates the horizontal traction from zero to maximum). Thus, only the treadle is left of all control tools. But, using the treadle (if we consider it as an analogue of another turn handle from a motorbike), we can turn the horizontal plane only in one side (motion of the treadle is one\u0001way like motion of the handle). It is very inconvenient and, therefore, unreal. So, we make a conclusion that the handle bar actually turns to the left and to the right and the handle bar controls turning. The photographs confirm this. Question : How can you prove that the treadle is used as a brake and is not, for example, a device controlling operation of a complex motion device? Answer : Let us think again. Both handles change speed from zero to maximum (one – vertically while another – horizontally). In order to contradict, if necessary, a vertical force, it is possible simply to unfold the blinds (de\u0001energize them) and, due to the fact that the platform ALWAYS flies with its bottom turned to the ground, gravity force does its work for us. It is different with the horizontal motion. We can gather speed from zero to maximum without any problems but how can we quickly slowdown if necessary? According to Grebennikov’s words, there is not even air friction! It leads to a necessity to have another control element on the platform, i.e. the treadle\u0001 brake, which acts the same way but opposite to the right handle. Question : It is not logically to trust one’s life to presence or absence of voltage in the accumulator. What if it will run down during flight? Answer : First, this is unlikely. Second, even this happens, nothing fatal will happen. The nets will work though not with maximal power. This event, possibly, will lead to a smooth landing of the aircraft (because the high\u0001potential terminal will run down not quickly but smoothly). Question : Why did Grebennikov tried to draw energy vortex exhaust from the platform on pictures of night flights? Answer : Possibly, Grebennikov used not cone cells but symmetric ones in his design. I.e. an aether flow was distributed up as well as down in them. This variant is a working one, too. Taking into account use of high\u0001voltage potential, aether flows carried bigger particles (charged ions, for example), which became visible in darkness. They were formed into single discrete pseudo\u0001vortexes due to presence of holes in the blinds’ metal plates (metal absorbs or hamper radiation while the holes let them pass freely). Question : Why do you think that the drive from the right rotary handle goes only to the front fans but not for all of them? Answer : Here is what Grebennikov wrote: “The upper part of my device is really a bike’s one: the right handle is used for horizontal\u0001 forward motion, which is made by incline of both groups of the blinds also through the cable” . He wrote “BOTH”, i.e. he meant the two front fans (a fan is a single group of the blinds or, in other words, a block\u0001board). Appendixes: scientific hypotheses and extracts from articles Lepton\u0001hypothesis of B.I. Isakov. Extracts Consequence 5. According to the formulas, an opportunity follows that high values of gradients of lepton physical fields’ objects can be observed in zones opposite to acute angles of solid bodies, geological rocks, on tectonic plates’ edges, on rock peaks, on tops of big cliffs and pyramids etc., particularly, matter outflow in the form of leptons and other elementary particles is possible. Discovery of electron emission in zones of geological rocks’ fractions (USSR, 1984) is a particular manifestation of a more general law. A body placed opposite to acute projected angles of other bodies or solid rocks, on tops of cliffs and pyramids etc. can be irradiated by leptons. On the contrary, bodies placed inside hollow planes of other solid bodies, for example,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"73 New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 inside pipes, cylinders, and cones or placed in a polyhedral or a 3\u0001dimensional angle can experience “swap\u0001out” of microleptons. Biological objects with weakened microlepton fields can be “charged” with lepton energy on tops of rocks or pyramids. On the contrary, excessively excited biological objects calm down quicker if they are placed into internal cavities of solid matter with negative curvature or into an angle, a bay etc. with geometrical unbalance of matter, which is equivalent to negative curvature (possibly, a custom of many nations to calm down overexcited children placing them in a corner makes sense). Consequence 14. According to the lepton hypothesis, each body is permeated extensively by lepton streams, which bombard it and balance lepton pressure up to a zero average resultant. Interaction of leptons with a body happens all over the body’s volume, not only on its surface. If preponderance or deficiency of lepton pressure will be artificially created just on one side by focusing lepton streams or, on the contrary, by obstruct them from the body by some screen or an artificial lepton vortex, a no\u0001zero resultant can be created, which will be able to move light objects. This can explain telekinesis phenomenon, particularly, experiments of V. Avdeev, R. Kuleshova and others and also poltergeist effects. The lepton hypothesis allows comprehending the universal gravity mechanism expressed by Newton’s law from a new point of view. Two bodies located close to each other partially screen each other from lepton streams’ pressure. From the external sides, preponderance of lepton pressure in comparison with a pressure from the side of a space between the bodies is created because each body partially hampers lepton streams coming through it. If point mass m is located near distributed mass M, a force equal to the screening force influences m... ... where d is a constant of proportionality; p is a density of matter in the distributed mass, g is a distance and a multitude of distances from variable body point M to point mass m; l is a body angle corresponding to angle sizes of distributed mass M and a point of location of point mass m; f(r) is a function of body M geometry; 12 is a function of geometry and curvature of a lepton stream in the given point of space. The lepton hypothesis allows not postulating but concluding, substantiating theoretically and comprehending, understanding Newton’s law, understanding the concealed gravity and remote influence mechanism. If two bodies with distributed masses M1 and M2 are located close to each other, a resultant force does not change fundamentally, only a conclusion of Newton’s low becomes more complex while the fundamental nature of the dependence does not change. Thus, according to the lepton hypothesis, attraction is a deficiency of repulsion, i.e. the law of gravity can be considered as a consequence of the law of lepton repulsion (or lepton compression, pressure) during bodies’ screening, which leads to that the bodies are pressed to each other. If the lepton hypothesis is right, it is possible to suppose a potential possibility of varying gravity and inertia mass of a body under certain conditions: 1) during change of lepton streams’ focusing with the help of “lepton lenses” causing their concentration on the given, lepton rockets and lepton flying discs; 2) during huge speed of lepton vortexes’ rotation with high angular velocity, which is equivalent to screening from lepton streams. If the lepton hypothesis is right, the mentioned mechanism gives a possibility of partial or complete gravity control. The suggested mechanism of potentially possible partial or complete levitation must be thoroughly checked experimentally. If the lepton hypothesis is right, lepton engines, rockets and flying discs are possible. A nature of the effect of cavitary structures Which is a physical nature of the cavitary structures effect? Many suppositions and hypothesis have been expressed but, unfortunately, many of them are connected with extrasensory perception, which is fashionable among modern intellectuals for some reasons. A theory of Leningrad physician, Doctor of Technical Science, V.F. Zolotarev"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"74     New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 deserves better attention. It was developed by him earlier and experimentally confirmed now. As a result of long combined researches, we characterized the discovery as “an unknown effect of multi\u0001cavitary structures’ interaction with living systems consisting in that, due to interference, de Broglie waves acco mpanying motion of electron flows in solid walls of cavities form a macroscopic field of multi\u0001 cavitary structures, which cause change of functional state of living objects locating in this field”. De Broglie waves are peculiar to moving micro\u0001 particles of any body. They are compensated inside the body and displayed as radiation on its surface. They are so short\u0001wave and super\u0001 high\u0001frequency that instruments pick them up only in the form of diffraction but still they helped science. Remember peculiar pictures of electrons and neutrons obtained on crystals and films with the help of de Broglie waves. Nobody thought that these scanty radiations can influence living matter somehow. And they did not influence – at least near flat objects. But near multi\u0001cavitary structures, where a square of solid bodies is big and multiply curved, de Broglie waves are put together and form, like musical overtones, harmonies with lower frequencies. Thus, lengthening and strengthening due to laying on ach other in cells, they form antinodes\u0001maximums of stationary de Broglie waves. Striking on these passive barriers, nerve impulses glitch changing their frequency and speed and causing not only seeming feelings but also sometimes considerable physiological changes. Stationary de Broglie waves do not have their own energy and, therefore, the law of energy conservation is not violated. Due to the fact that de Broglie waves moves in physical vacuum, the effect of cavitary structures must permeate everything. We observe it when we uselessly try to stop the effect up by any screen. The editors’ note: In 1996, Prof. Zolotarev gave me a copy of his manuscript. We studied it, prepared a plan of experiments and began to search for investors. It was useless. Our situation that time could be described by words “starvation” and “poverty”. I remember that Professor had to raise chickens in his flat for some food. Possibly, now somebody will be seriously interested in beginning a research program on the effect of cavitary structures aimed at creation of real engines for space systems. A.V. Frolov. Energy fields of geometrical forms www.keelynet.com Works of Wilhelm Reich are also connected with change aether density. We would like to express some interesting thoughts: “Energy fields of geometrical forms” are special effects connected with the modern concept of aether. Some optimal geometrical forms and materials can be used for constructing devices, which react under influence of only environmental conditions, i.e. without additional external stimulation. Contraction details of two simple devices, which produce a tangible linear force influence without use of any additional energy at the input. It is possible to note two meanings of these training demonstration devices: (1) they prove that an aetheric kind of matter exists and any average person can feel it; (2) they demonstrate reliable methods of aetheric activation, which can be used for new energy applications. Other examples of devices with efficiency more than one include a venerable organ\u0001pipe and an electromagnetic antenna. These devices work using resonance method when relatively low vibration of amplitude is reflected back. An echo signal can be many times more than an input signal in dependence on sizes of the device. The most effective size of the resonator accurately corresponds with a quarter of the initial wave length. Resonance will also occur with any lengths which are divisible by an odd number of a quarter of waves’ lengths. In these cases, we find that geometry of the specific device has minor significance. If the geometry is optimized for conditions at the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"75 New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 input, a maximal increase or an increased echo can be obtained. We can summarize characteristics of these “super\u0001single” devices as devices using “geometrical energy fields” because intensity of full energy of echo, which can be produced only as a function of size, form and location. Remembering that, we can suppose that certain highly optimized geometrical forms could provide for an increased echo without any additional input signal at all. Such a device could induce an effective echo increasing the finest vibrations at quantum level, which are much lower than the threshold our ability to measure them. Despite the fact that the subtlest natural forces have been studied for thousands years, it can be proved that a modern era began in 1844. In 1844, Baron Karl von Reichenbach from Stuttgart published a series of letters describing his research of aether, which was called “OD” by him. Reichenbach discovered that a part of all people can visually feel outflow from tops of crystals and magnets if they had been first properly located in full darkness. He called such people “sensitives”. Some time later, Reichenbach decided that aether can permeate through materials like silk, glass and metal. According to his ideas, aether seems to permeate all things in different density. Large quantities of aether could be found in sunlight and candle flame. On the edge of the century, an Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner with clairvoyance talent researched an invisible world of aetheric forces. His close partner and biographer Guenther Wachsmith continued this work after Steiner’s death and published a masterwork of his teacher called “Aetheric shaping forces in Space, Earth and Man”. A first true engineer of aetheric forces was Wilhelm Reich who discovered, as he called it, an “orgone energy” in 1939. Like Reichenbach, Reich discovered that metals able to conduct aether a hundred ears ago. His real big achievement, however, was an understanding of the fact that organic materials have a tendency to absorb aether. Laying two kinds of materials together, Reich could produce a directed aether flow. Reich developed a first working device for collection and concentration of aether. An “orgone accumulator” is a box with six walls made of alternating layers of metal and organic materials. Under controlled conditions, this device produced an inexplicable temperature increase in its internal part. This was enough for attracting attention of Albert Einstein who met Reich in January 1941. Reich also experimented with a “cloudbuster” (a buster for clouds dispersion), a tower\u0001shaped device which, most likely, directed an aether flow through atmosphere. Possible, the biggest contribution to aether engineering technologies was made by Trevor James Constable. He was a follower of Steiner, Wachsmith, Reich and others. He spent more than 40 years improving use of the aether technology of weather control. He discovered that some geometrical forms, possibly, show a big aether echo. During many years, he developed his methods so that a device with a size of a coffee mug located, accordingly, far from an ocean ship could change weather condition over a distance of many miles around it. Constable discovery of resonance aetheric structures was important for research of the new energy. Now a simple geometrical device can direct a concentrated beam of aetheric forces through any type of a device with high accuracy. Actually, a degree of aether concentration is so high that human organs of senses can directly feel its resultant pressure. Thanks to pioneer works of the above mentioned scientists, it is possible to describe a design of two resonance aether devices, which Fig. 10. Stimulation of the directed aether stream"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"76     New Energy Technologies #3(22) 2005 Fig. 11. The “emitting” device of ECS Fig. 12. The “vacuum” device of ECS were called “Chi Pencils” by the author. Both devices are built around a central resonance cavity. A formula for calculation of the resonance cavity’s size was obtained from a research of a ballistics expert Gerald Bull from Philadelphia. An “emitting” device is generally a cylindrical metal cavity with a no\u0001metal external layer. Due to boundary effects discovered by Reich, aether is absorbed from space through a side surface and emitted through both sides (actually, it is like laser). Geometrical energy fields around the emitting device are shown on Fig. 11. How to build the emitting device. The following things are necessary: \u0001 a piece of a 5/32\u0001inches copper pipe; \u0001 a 1/8\u0001inches soft cotton cord; \u0001 a metal knife for the pipe; \u0001 a meter\u0001stick, a sharp knife and glue. Cut a piece of the copper pipe with a length of 18.1 cm. Apply a small bead of hot glue to the external part of one end and fix the cotton cord there. Wind 2 cm, apply a bead of hot glue and wind the cord arount the entire pipe. Cut excess of the cord. A “vacuum” device is made the other way. We need a non\u0001metal cylindrical cavity with a metal external layer. Aether is drawn into one end and dispersed through the sides. A geometrical energy field around the vacuum device is shown on Fig. 12. How to build the vacuum device. The following things are necessary: \u0001 a piece of vinyl hose with a diameter of 5/ 32 inches; \u0001 a piece of a copper pipe with a diameter of 5/16 inches; \u0001 a metal knife for the hose and the pipe; \u0001 a meter\u0001stick, a sharp knife and electrical insulation tape. Cut a piece of the copper pipe with a length of 18.1 cm. Wind the electrical insulation tape around the vinyl hose in some places in such a way that it could closely go into the copper pipe. Push the vinyl hose into the copper pipe until its end appear. Cut excess of the vinyl hose. The noted streams of aether forces generated by above described different resonance devices allow defying their discovery by standard instruments. It is not surprising that, as many people think, aether is “live” energy while standard instruments are, of course, “dead”. However, discovery of aether forces by a living organism (such as a human body) is known. Editors’ note: we hope that publication of the given materials will cause interest of experimenters who will try to examine these effects. Creating aether streams, changing aether density, it is possible to produce not only force effects, i.e. motion. Due to the fact that matter elements are processes in aether (vortex processes), aether parameters influence speed of existence of any matter. It was confirmed in the experiments which were carried out by our company with V.A. Chernobrov. It is obvious that gravity and time speed are mutually connected effects. Due to this, creation of such devices defies not only the Earth’s gravity but also Time. We would appreciate offers from organizations which could invest into development of these technologies. A.V.
