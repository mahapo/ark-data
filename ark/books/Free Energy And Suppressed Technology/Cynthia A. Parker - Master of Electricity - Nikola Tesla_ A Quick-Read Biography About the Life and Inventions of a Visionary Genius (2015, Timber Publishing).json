At times, the world is ready for such aperson, but more often than not, the scientific and public worlds just cannotaccept changes to established norms.Nikola Tesla was one of these men. He was born a century too early, and heunderstood this. “ The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. Hedoes not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work islike that of the planter – for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation forthose who are to come, and point the way ” (Jones, 2014).There is a new wave of Nikola Tesla fans who are pushing to give Tesla thecredit he deserves. He produced dozens of inventions in the production,transmission, and application of electric power. He invented the firstalternating current or A/C motor and developed A/C generation and transmissiontechnology. He invented the induction motor, rotary transformers, andhigh-frequency alternators, the Tesla oscillator and coil and Tesla pumps aswell as devices for lightning protection. He invented turbines for water, steamand gas, and systems for wireless communications. Radio frequency oscillatorswere his. He also invented insulation, vertical take-off and landing aircraft,polyphase systems, concepts of electric vehicles and devices of high voltagedischarges and ionized gasses. He talked to the stars and tried to run theweather. He had a vision to end all wars and developed a “death beam.”He was famous, respected, brilliant and broke. Tesla held more than 300 knownpatents, but was never able to convert his inventions into long-term financialsuccess.Nikola Tesla was dazzling, and his inventions revolutionized the world’s way oflife. He was not the average man. He only needed two to three hours of sleep pernight and was known to be a bit of a recluse. At one time, he bragged aboutworking in his laboratory for 84 hours without sleep. He spoke eight languagesand could memorize a book at one sitting.Like many geniuses, Tesla had a peculiar side. He was repulsed by women’sjewelry and pearls and had dreams and nightmares of light and dark.Tesla thought of himself as one who could harness the forces of nature tocontribute to human needs. He was an inventor who was often unrewarded andunnoticed, but he found compensation in just inventing. All he wanted was tomake life easier for his fellow world citizens.Tesla said, “Electric power is everywhere present in unlimited quantities, itcan drive the world's machinery without the need of coal, oil, gas or any otherfuel.\" He pictured electricity as being cosmic, always there; a vast pool ofenergy. He was and is the master of electricity.Tesla was a visionary, and most of his contemporary scientist brothers did notunderstand his technology, experiments and drive to create. He has yet to beadequately credited for his invention of radio, and Edison has always beenthought of as the \"father of electricity\" and for “his” work in alternatingcurrent. Edison did not work with A/C. A/C was Tesla’s lifelong work. CHAPTER I: THE BEGINNING OF AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE “But not until I had attained manhood did I realize that I was an inventor.”~ N. Tesla Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American, best known as an inventor, mechanicalengineer, futurist, and an electrical engineer. Born on July 10, 1856, littledid his parents know he would one day become a “mad scientist.”Born in Smiljan, which was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire region ofCroatia, Nikola was the fourth of five children belonging to Milutin Tesla, anOrthodox priest, and Djuka Tesla, a remarkable woman. Ironically, a fiercesummer lighting storm was raging in the vicinity as Nikola Tesla was born. Midway through his birth a midwife declared that the lightning was a bad omen.“This child will be a child of darkness,” she said. Nikola’s mother replied,“No. He will be a child of light,” (Johnson, 2013).Tesla remembers his father as a loving, but stern Orthodox priest. Milutin Teslahad a gift for poetry and was also a published writer and book collector.Tesla’s father was the son of one of Napoleon’s officers, was a professor ofmathematics in a prominent institution, and had received a military education.Before Tesla was born, his father joined the clergy and received accolades as agreat speaker. Tesla claims his father was a natural philosopher, poet, andwriter. His sermons were said to be “as eloquent as those of Abrahama-Sancta-Clara.” Tesla’s father spoke many languages and for someone so sternand orthodox, he also had a humorous and loving side.[Image00002.jpg] After he learned to read, Tesla would immerse himself in hisfather’s library and read everything he could. He quickly found that he couldalso memorize the books he read. However, his continual reading was frowned onby his father. Milutin believed that reading too early in life would ruin one’seyes. Undiscouraged by his father’s opinion, Tesla learned to cover the keyholesand cracks in the door in order to read until midnight.Tesla’s mother, Djuka, had no formal education, but she was brilliant,hardworking and despite being illiterate, could memorize long, complicatedpoems. Djuka Tesla invented appliances to help with her chores around the houseand farm. One of her inventions was a mechanical eggbeater. Tesla always claimedthat his inventive instincts and photographic memory came from his mother.“[She was] an inventor of the first order and would, I believe, have achievedgreat things had she not been so remote from modern life and its multifoldopportunities. She invented and constructed all kinds of tools and devices andwove the finest designs from thread that was spun by her. She even planted theseeds, raised the plants, and separated the fibers herself. She workedindefatigably, from break of day till late at night, and most of the wearingapparel and furnishings of the home was the product of her hands,” (Winston,2013).FAMILY TRAGEDYWhen Tesla was only five, his brother Dane was killed in an equestrian accidentwhile riding a beloved family Arabian horse. The horse, Nikola claimed, “Hadalmost human intelligence.” The horse had saved his father from a winterblizzard but was responsible for Nikola’s brother’s death. Tesla witnessed thetragic scene and the loss unsettled young Nikola. He became deeply afraid ofghosts, ogres and other monsters of the dark. He experienced terrifyingnightmares and learned to stay awake for hours during the night. He rememberedthe day his brother died in vivid detail for the rest of his life.After his brother’s death, Nikola Tesla felt he had to work very hard to makehis parents proud of him. “The recollection of his attainments made every effortof mine seem dull in comparison. Anything I did that was creditable merelycaused my parents to feel their loss more keenly. So I gave up with littleconfidence in myself,” (Tesla, N. 2011).PATERNAL AND COMMUNITY INFLUENCENikola Tesla was far from a stupid boy. He remembers one event where the city’sAldermen were out walking. Tesla was playing with other boys and having a greattime. The oldest of these venerable gentlemen and a wealthy citizen, stopped togive a silver coin to each of the boys. When he came up to Nikola, the Aldermanstopped and commanded, “Look in my eyes.” Nikola met his gaze, with his handoutstretched to receive the coin, but to Tesla’s dismay the Alderman said, “No,not much; you can get nothing from me. You are too smart,” (Tesla, 2011).Tesla’s father was a dreamer with a poetic touch and a hard exterior. Mulitinran his life in a very precise and extremely orderly fashion. Yet, Teslaemulated his father and sought to develop his life to be similarly precise andorganized. Tesla credits his father for his mental training. His father providedhim all types of mental exercise such as guessing one another’s thoughts,discovering mistakes in expressions, repeating long sentences and performingmental calculations. These daily lessons were designed to strengthen Tesla’smemory and reason and to mature his critical senses.Nikola Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan and studied German, arithmeticand religion. He was an intense student and ran through his schooling andlessons quickly to catch up to his older brother who had been a genius.In 1862, Nikola moved with his family to Gospić, within the Austrian Empire,where he attended lower gymnasium or primary school. Then in 1870m Nikola andhis family then moved to Karlovac, Croatia and where he attended school at theHigh or Real Gymnasium. Here Tesla cultivated a reputation as an excellentstudent. He was able to perform integral calculus in his mind. His teachersoriginally thought Tesla was somehow cheating.EARLY HEALTH STRUGGLESTesla had some very interesting sensitivities to sounds and feelings. Nikolaclaimed he could hear a fly land in the next room, and if a train passed by itjarred him terribly and he awoke screaming and writhing. His mother put his bedon rubber cushions to prevent it from moving when trains passed.In his youth, Tesla suffered from the appearance of strange images and flashesof light. “They were pictures of things and scenes which I had really seen,never of those imagined. When a word was spoken to me the image of the object itdesignated would present itself vividly to my vision and sometimes I was quiteunable to distinguish whether what I saw was tangible or not. This caused megreat discomfort and anxiety,” (Tesla, 2011).He developed talents that led him to introspection, pre-visioning andintuitiveness. He could actually visualize things and was almost able tophotograph his thoughts. He believed people could develop ways to see thoughtsand communicate with one another with by only using these envisioned thoughts,(Cheney, 2011).Tesla believed he could project his “visions to the mind of another person.” Hebegan to take his visions further afield and claimed to visit new places,countries, and cities. He believed he met new people and made friendships whileon his mind travels. Tesla alleged to the day he died that these visits andvisions were as real as the things he saw and felt in everyday life.Doctors and psychologists claim that Tesla suffered from synesthesia or acondition where stimulation of one sensory conduit leads to involuntaryexperiences in another sensory conduit. Tesla’s symptoms were from auditory tovisual. When someone spoke about a subject, place or person, Tesla couldvisualize them in 3D. Not many geniuses have this condition, but VladimirNabokov, Franz Liszt and the Duke of Ellington were a few synesthetes in Tesla’stime.When Tesla was 15, he saw a steel engraving of Niagara Falls. He visualized ahuge water wheel being turned by the powerful torrent behind the falls. He toldhis father that one day he would go to America and capture the energy of thismighty torrent. He would fulfill his own prophesy and seize that energy thirtyyears later.His visions continued well into his seventeenth year when his thoughts turned toinventions. He could imagine what he wanted to work on, and he needed no models,blueprints or drawings. He pictured the invention in his mind. He believed thathe had developed a new method of materializing inventive concepts and ideas.Little did he realize that he was unique and not everyone could visualize exactproportions, colors, and sizes. Because of this ability to visualize hisinventions, he often did not write down the technical details of his experimentsand inventions.Throughout his entire life, particularly beginning when he was only 17, Teslanever rushed into actual production of his inventions. When he received an idea,he built it up in his imagination, reviewed the construction, made improvementsand operated the device in his mind. With his mind Tesla could visualize hisinventions and experiments and see if everything was in balance. Once he felthis invention was perfect, he then turned his inventions into concrete products.His experiments and devices always seemed to come out how he imagined. Becauseof this, he held a bit of contempt for those inventors who did not thoroughlythink through their projects before putting them into practice. “There isscarcely a subject that cannot be examined beforehand, from the availabletheoretical and practical data. The carrying out into practice of a crude ideaas is being generally done, is, I hold, nothing but a waste ofenergy, money, and time,” (Tesla, 2011).DECIDING ON A CAREER[Image00003.jpg] Tesla was determined to become an engineer, but his fatherstubbornly insisted that Nikola enter the priesthood. When Tesla was seventeen,he contracted cholera and was near death several times over a nine-month period.In desperation Tesla’s father, agreed to send Tesla to the best engineeringschool if he would only fight and recover from this disease.He recuperated from his long illness with cholera and took time off to visit theneighboring area of Tomingaj. Here, for over a year, he hid out in the hills toavoid a three-year mandatory military service requirement and think about hislife. For most of this year of healing, Tesla roamed around the mountains withhis hunter’s tools and a bundle of books. He felt, “This contact with naturemade me stronger in body as well as in mind,” (Tesla Universe, 2012). Teslaclaims he read one of Mark Twain’s humorous books during his year in the wildand felt life return to him. Years later when he became friends with Twain,Tesla related this experience which moved Mark Twain to tears.CHAPTER II: EDUCATION AND MOVING FORWARD “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy,frequency and vibration.” ~ N. Tesla In 1875 Nikola Tesla registered for school at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz,Austria. He was awarded a military scholarship due to his father’s influence andhis own high scores. He received the highest marks possible, on no occasion didhe miss a lecture, and he was successful in taking all nine required exams. Heorganized a Serbian club that dealt with culture, art, music, and literature.Tesla received letters of commendation from the dean of the faculty. Teslastudied from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day including Sundays and holidays. Whengoing through his father’s papers, Tesla came upon a packet of communicationsfrom the dean of the college. Although they were complimentary, they did statethat Tesla's intensive study was going to \"kill him.\"At the Institute Tesla studied electrical as well as mechanical engineering. Hisphysics teacher allowed him to work with a new Gramme dynamo that was both amotor and a generator. The mechanism used direct current. Tesla suggested to thefaculty that it was possible to do away with the sparking connections orcommutators. Professor Poeschl laughed. The professor claimed that this would bea perpetual motion machine, and not even Tesla could build such a contraption.Tesla knew that the solution lay in electric currents that alternated and he hadcontemplated this idea for years (Tesla: Life and Legacy, n.d.).Although he was brilliant in all his studies, Tesla was a trial when he had anidea in his head. He argued with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme Dynamo. TheGramme Dynamo, while employing D/C power could be both a motor and a generator.Tesla claimed he could rebuild the dynamo to be more efficient. After observingthe dynamo for a time, Tesla suggested it was possible to release theinefficient sparking connector commutators. Poeschl claimed Tesla was demented.Tesla realized the solution to efficient energy lay in electric currents thatalternated. He continually argued his point and unfortunately, at the end of hissecond year, Tesla lost his scholarship. A GAMBLING STREAKWith no scholarship and refusing to tell his family about his dilemma, Teslabecame addicted to gambling. During his third year at school, Tesla wagered awayhis allowance and tuition money. Gambling was a mania for Tesla and to sit downfor a game of cards was the utmost in pleasure. His father did not excuse thissenseless waste of time and money, but Tesla would say to his father, “I canstop whenever I please.” His mother understood why he had to gamble and knew hewould not quit unless it was his idea. “One afternoon, I remember, when I lostall my money and was craving for a game, she came to me with a roll of bills andsaid, “Go and enjoy yourself. The sooner you lose all we possess, the better itwill be. I know that you will get over it,” (Tesla, 1877). Shortly after thisconversation, Tesla conquered his gambling addiction.Tesla regained his initial losses through more gambling, but turned his winningsover to his family. However, because of his gambling addiction, when third-yearexams came due Tesla was totally unprepared. He asked for an extension but wasdenied. As a result, he never graduated from the university and did not receivehis final grades.During Tesla’s rebellious time, his father suffered an unknown illness orperhaps had a stroke, and died. Tesla’s father was interred in Divoselso at theJasikovac cemetery where his family lay. After his father's death, Tesla stayedat home with his mother and taught classes at his old school in Gospić. Tesladid not enjoy teaching; this was not his dream.WORK AT THE BUDAPEST TELEPHONE EXCHANGE AND THE A/C MOTOR VISIONToward the end of 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest to work at a telegraph company,the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Tesla quickly realized the new company was notfinished enough to be functional, and moved on to become a draftsman at theCentral Telegraph office instead. Several months later the Budapest TelephoneExchange became operational, and Tesla was granted the chief electricianposition. He made improvements to the Central Station equipment and perfected atelephone amplifier. This invention was never publicly credited to Tesla.During this time, Tesla suffered a mental breakdown and was not expected tolive. His sensory processing difficulties had started chattering in his mindonce again. A ticking of a watch sounded like hammers; ordinary speech was likeyelling, and the slightest touch had the mental effect of a blow. These sensoryproblems later manifested into a deeper sickness and an aloof strangeness aroundTesla. Psychologists claim that during this period Tesla developed what is nowdiagnosed as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.Eventually, he recovered from his breakdown and began walking around the city toregain his strength. During a walk in the Varosliget City Park in Budapest,Tesla had an epiphany. He stated that as he stared at the setting sun, anepisode from Goethe’s Faust entered his mind.The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soilUpon its track to follow, follow soaring! Like a flash of lightening a vision came to him. He drew a diagram of the A/Cmotor with a stick and in the sand. He presented this same diagram six yearslater in an address before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers(Tesla: Life and Legacy, n.d).WORKING FOR EDISON’S D/C SYSTEMS AND IMMIGRATIONIn April of 1882 Tesla and Anthony Szigethy, a good friend, went to work for theContinental Edison Company in Paris. Tesla’s supervisor was Charles Bachelor whotook young Tesla under his wing. He assigned Tesla to install lighting systemsin the Paris Opera House and Theater in Bavaria. Tesla was also asked to work upa plan to improve the Edison dynamos at the company. His plan was approved andaccepted. Nikola believed he was going to be rewarded handsomely for his work,but was transferred to Strasburg before payment was ever received. He ultimatelyrealized that his reward “was a fictitious castle in Spain.”In Strasbourg, France, Tesla was assigned to repair a D/C lighting systeminstalled at the German Railway company. He performed his miracle, fixed thesystem and waited to be paid. The government approved a job well done, butagain, Tesla never received compensation.1883 found Tesla demonstrating his newly completed A/C induction motor beforethe former mayor of Strasburg and several potential investors. They watched themotor with interest but did not invest due to misunderstandings and a lack ofunderstanding about electricity.[Image00004.jpg] In 1884 when Nikola Tesla was only 28, Mr. Bachelor, hissupervisor at Continental Edison in Paris, pressed Tesla to go to America andwork at Edison’s company. Tesla liquefied his assets, secured passage and got tothe railroad station just as the train was pulling out. While running quickly tothe train, Tesla discovered that his money and tickets were gone. He managed tojump on the train with the remnants of his belongings, some poems and articleshe had written, a package of calculations, and his flying machine model. Thevoyage for Tesla was spent sitting in the stern of the ship watching for peopleto jump overboard.CHAPTER III: TESLA’S WEIRD AND WONDERFUL LIFE Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When theyseparate, man is no more.” ~ N. Tesla Tesla’s private life was an enigma. He had many famous friends like Mark Twainand Katharine Johnson wife of Tesla’s friend, Roger Underwood Johnson. He was afriend of John Muir, one of the founders of the Sierra Club. Muir loved Tesla’shydroelectric power system and the two of them would often talk about theenvironment and how they could save it. The Niagara plant was a clean andperfectly acceptable energy system to both Tesla and Muir. Alternating currents(A/C) ran the waterfall and Tesla referred to the Niagara Falls project as“running on the wheelwork of nature.”Tesla was a bit of a loner and a recluse. He was a bachelor and preferred towork alone. He did not enter into corporate associations and did not mix withfriends very often. When he went out in society, it was on his terms and in hisplaces. Acquaintances who wanted something from him came to him. He preferrednot go out much in society.Tesla could be a very funny companion and he had a very dry sense of humor.After dining with Rudyard Kipling, he wrote a note to one of his friends:April 1, 1901My dear Mrs. Johnson,What is the matter with inkspiller Kipling? He actually dared to invite me todine in an obscure hotel where I would be sure to get hair and cockroaches inthe soup.Yours Truly,N. TeslaThis note was written tongue in cheek. This dinner pleased Tesla very much(Jacobson, 2013).[Image00005.jpg] Another humorous incident was a bit of a practical joke whichTesla played on Mark Twain. Tesla had built an earthquake machine in hisManhattan laboratory that shook the building and nearly brought down theneighborhood. This machine was really a high frequency oscillator, but a pistonset beneath a platform in the laboratory shook violently as electricity waspoured into it. This was essentially an experiment to developing more efficientelectricity. Twain had a digestive problem and often left meetings to use thefacilities. Tesla knew Mark Twain was having dinner in the neighboring hotel’srestaurant. He invited Twain over to watch his “earthquake” experiment. Twainwas game, and Tesla asked him to stand on the platform. Tesla flipped on theoscillator. Ninety seconds passed and Twain, white-faced and in pain, jumped offthe platform and ran for the facilities (Jacobson, 2013). It is rumored thatTesla had a good chuckle by having literally “shook the poop” out of Mark Twain.PHOBIAS AND ECCENTRICITIESAs a child, a young man and, in fact, as an older man, Tesla had so many phobiasit was impossible to have close friendships and relationships with women. Hehated jewelry, perfume made him physically ill, and he could not bear to touchhair or shake hands. He was so incredibly smart that he had a very hard timecoming “down to the level of his peers.” These phobias and characteristicscondemned Tesla to a secluded life. He always wore gloves when he ate and wipedhis utensils at least 18 times with napkins. The people who took care of hishotel rooms were required to wear white gloves and hair coverings. They were totouch nothing that belonged to Tesla.It was said that he sent his secretary home for the day when she wore pearls tothe office. He refused to look at or speak to women who wore pearls and wouldleave the room if women had on too much jewelry.He never married, never had children, and there are no reports or rumors ofaffairs. Tesla once said, “I do not think you can name many great inventionsthat have been made by married men.” Yet, he admired women and in his lateryears regretted that he had not taken the time to get to know someone he mightmarry.“I had always thought of women as possessing those delicate qualities of mindand soul that made her in these respects far superior to man. I had put her on alofty pedestal, figuratively speaking, and ranked her in certain importantattributes considerably higher than man, I worshiped at the feet of the creatureI had raised to this height, and, like every true worshiper, and I felt myselfunworthy of the object of my worship” (WTM.org Community, 2012).CITIZENSHIP AND DAILY ROUTINESTesla was a very busy scientist. Not only was he actively inventing he was alsolearning how to be an American citizen. On the 30th of July, 1891 Nikola Teslabecame an American Citizen. He often exclaimed to friends that he valued hiscitizenship in America more than any of his scientific honors.At 6’2” and 142 pounds, he was an elegant figure in New York City. He wasmeticulous in grooming, wore the most fashionable clothing, and was highlyregimented in all his activities. He worked every day from 9:00 am until 6:00 pmand ate dinner at exactly 8:10 pm at Delmonico’s restaurant or the WaldorfAstoria Hotel. He telephoned his dinner order to the headwaiter who was the onlyone allowed to serve him. Tesla always wore gloves to dinner, he insisted hiswaiter wear white gloves, and he usually dined alone. After dinner, he resumedhis work often until 3:00 am. Exercise consisted of walking 8 to 10 miles everyday. He also had the interesting habit of squishing his toes one hundred timesevery night. Squishing his toes, he claimed, stimulated his brain cells.Tesla was a vegetarian in his later life. He did confine his meals to milk,bread, honey and vegetable juices.SOMEWHAT-SOCIAL TESLATesla was standoffish, but polite and was excited to meet Anthony Dvorak andRudyard Kipling at the home of his good friend Robert Underwood Johnson. Teslabecame acquainted with Ignace Paderewski, a Polish pianist, and composer. Healso was friends with Helen Hunt Jackson, Nellie Melba, Senator George Hearstand actress Sarah Bernhard. He lived at the Waldorf Astoria for almost twentyyears, the gathering place of intellectuals and celebrities. Paderewski, Roentgen (the inventor of the x-ray), and Tesla were at theUniversity of Strasburg together. They did not know one another since none ofthem were famous at the time. They became friends and often met at the home ofRoger Underwood Johnson to toast one another’s successes and fame, (TeslaMemorial Society, 2014).It is interesting to note that Paderewski received many honors for his music,and Roentgen received accolades including the title of “Baron.” Tesla declinedseveral offers of titles and refused decorations offered to him by rulers offoreign countries. He did take kindly, however, to the honors given to him byscientific and university organizations in different parts of the world.Tesla had a photographic memory and was famous for memorizing books. Hestockpiled visions for inventions in his head. He had a powerful imagination andthe ability to visualize in three dimensions. He was mystical and eccentric andknown for having excessive hygiene habits. He could be funny and entertainingand when in good humor was interesting to be around.Nikola Tesla was the first one to discover the electron. In his article “Replyto J.J. Thomson’s note,” published in the “ Electrical Engineer , New York”Tesla claimed that his experiments proved the existence of electrically chargedparticles. Thomson denied Tesla’s discovery, but claimed this same discovery forhimself five years later. Thomson used different experiments that were patternedafter Tesla's experiments. Tesla was quite upset, but there was nothing he coulddo about it; given he had neglected to file a patent.Tesla was invited to lecture around the world, and he discussed alternatecurrent’s potential in London and again in Paris. He was famous for hisachievements and his obsessions earned him a reputation as the archetypal “madscientist.” Meanwhile he continued to invent and file patents.Tesla could have been the world’s first billionaire. The royalty payments on hisA/C patents alone were worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Unfortunately,Tesla burned through his entire fortune on failed projects and threw away hismost lucrative patents.Tesla continued to be somewhat acknowledged with the first book about hisexploits being written by Thomas Commerford Martin, The Inventions, Researchesand Writings of Nikola Tesla. This book is a comprehensive compilation ofTesla’s work and contains some of his illustrations. In the same year, Tesla wasfinally recognized by his home country. He was voted a corresponding member ofthe Serbian Royal Academy of Belgrade.Tesla’s greatest heartbreak happened at his lab in New York City on WestBroadway was destroyed when fire broke out in the basement. Although his lab wason the fourth floor, nothing could be saved. Hundreds of inventions, models,notes, plans, laboratory data, photographs, and tools valued at $50,000 weregone. Tesla is quoted as saying, “I am in too much grief to talk. What can Isay,” (Tesla Universe, 2014). Yet, due to his genius, most of his writings,experiments and inventions were stored in his mind. CHAPTER IV: EDISON, THE TESLA ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY AND GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE “Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work andaccomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I have reallyworked, is mine.” ~ N. TeslaMEETING EDISONNikola Tesla’s meeting with Thomas Edison was one of the most memorable eventsin his life. Tesla was amazed at Edison, who without any early advantages orscientific training had accomplished so much. Tesla felt he was inferior toEdison.Tesla was almost immediately hired by Thomas Edison and in June 1884 began hiscareer at Edison Machine Works. Simple electrical engineering was Tesla’s firstposition, and he was dispatched to work on Henry Villard’s passenger steamer theS. S. Oregon. This passenger ship was the first ship ever to be lit up withelectricity. Tesla also discovered that the dynamos that powered the Oregon weredamaged, and he set about repairing them. Tesla was successful, and Edison wasquoted, “Bachelor, this is a good man,” (Nikola Tesla, 2014).[Image00006.jpg] Edison needed Tesla to modernize his company and teach him newways of using electricity. Workers in Edison’s company complained that Edisonrefused to change with the times. Edison ignored advancing radio, and otherissues that involved electrical ideas. He perfected a D/C system and felt thathis D/C experiments were the wave of the future. Edison resisted change that hedid not precipitate. Most of Edison’s inventive efforts were put into thebattery, and he did improve the phonograph. Tesla once said that Edison did whathe knew, and he did it well.Tesla, on the other hand, created this new age of electricity. He was a newbreed of deep thinkers. He preferred to work alone, and he alone must set theagenda. His genius made it impossible for him to engage in give and take withothers. He kept his ideas in his head until they were ready to be produced.Tesla believed that people were so absorbed in the contemplation of the outsideworld that they were oblivious to what was happening inside their minds. He setout to prove he was not that ordinary.Edison was highly impressed with Tesla’s inventive mind and diligence. Heoffered Tesla the duty of redesigning the Edison Company’s direct currentgenerators. Tesla claimed he could and would design Edison’s inefficient motorsand generators. Edison remarked, “There’s fifty thousand dollars in it for youif you can do it,” (History, 2014). (Fifty thousand dollars in 1884 wasequivalent to $1M in today’s economy.) Tesla invested months of work, finishedthe task and asked for payment. Edison replied “Tesla, you don’t understand ourAmerican humor,” (Nikola Tesla, 2014). Instead Edison offered Tesla a $10 a weekraise. Tesla was irritated at the practical joke, refused the raise, andimmediately quit.BLAZING HIS OWN PATHNikola Tesla left Edison’s company and started his own business, Tesla ElectricLight Company. His investors were Robert Lane and Benjamin Vale. The companyinstalled electrical arc lights based on Tesla’s illumination systems. Tesla’sarc light invention was one of the first patents Tesla applied for in the UnitedStates. Tesla continually promoted his A/C motor, but his investors had nointerest in A/C equipment and motors. They only wanted to make money with anelectrical utility. Tesla watched as his system of arc lighting was adopted forfactory and municipal lights. He was proud of his accomplishments, but the A/Cmotor was his dream. Lane and Vale forced Tesla out of Tesla Electric LightCompany, and left him with a beautifully engraved certified stock certificatethat had no value. Again, Tesla was penniless. He lost control of his patents.They had been assigned to the company.Tesla was out of work and had no prospects. He worked as an electrical repairmanand dug ditches for $2 a day just to keep a roof over his head. He questionedhis genius during this time and called the winter of 1886-87 a time of “terribleheadaches and bitter tears” (Tesla Timeline, 2014). [Image00007.jpg] A/C POWER IS BORNHe began again to work with his electricity experiments, sought out investors,and was finally funded by Alfred S. Brown, director of Western Union and hisassociate Charles F. Peck. They believed in Tesla’s alternating current system.Tesla moved his operations to Pittsburgh and agreed to split his patentsfifty-fifty. He built a lab and applied for his first A/C patent. He invented and obtained patents on polyphase motors, dynamos, and transformersfor a complete alternating current power system. Tesla discussed his inventionswith friends and investors and eventually found more backers to support hisresearch into alternating current. In 1887-88, he filed for 30 patents for thisspecific invention and was invited to address the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers. His paper was entitled, “ A New System ofAlternate-Current Motors and Transformers ”.He returned to New York City and resumed his work in a Laboratory on GrandStreet. He began in earnest to redesign and perfect the design of high-frequencymachines. There were problems of construction in this unexplored field, andTesla faced many difficulties. He first rejected the inducer fearing it wouldnot yield sine waves that were important to resonant actions. He was alsodiscouraged by the inconstancy of speed that the high-frequency alternatorseemed to employ. He began to feel that he needed to invent a simpler device forthe production of electric oscillations.In late 1887, Nikola Tesla filed for seven more U.S. patents for polyphase A/Cmotors and power transmission. His motor produced alternative currents and histransformers stepped up and stepped down the voltage as required. Altogether heheld 40 basic U.S. patents for his A/C electric system.His lectures, patents, and research quickly caught the attention of GeorgeWestinghouse. Westinghouse hired Tesla, licensed the patents for Tesla’s A/Cinventions and provided him with his lab. The polyphase patents were sold toGeorge Westinghouse for $25,000 in cash, $50,000 in notes and royalties of $2.50per horsepower for each motor. Tesla, with backing from Westinghouse, solved theproblem of sending high voltage electricity through wires. His transformerallowed alternative current (A/C) to be stepped up and down according to needs.This process cannot be done with direct current or Edison’s D/C transformers.EDISON’S D/C VS. TESLA’S A/CEdison’s direct current system distributed electrical power at the same voltageused by lamps and motors. Distribution required the use of large and costlywires and generating plants needed to be near loads. Meanwhile, with thedevelopment of Tesla’s practical transformer, alternative current power could besent long distances over small wires. The voltage could be reduced and used byconsumers. A/C generating stations were larger, cheaper to operate, andelectricity was less costly. Both systems A/C and D/C were protected by patents.Very quickly, the commercial rivalry between Westinghouse-Tesla and Edison grewto highly competitive plateaus. Using Tesla’s inventions, Westinghouse began afull-scale industrial war. At stake was the future of industrial development inthe United States.Edison, who was an expert at marketing, launched a publicity campaign to provehis D/C power was better for the country, and that A/C or alternating currentswere very dangerous. To prove his point, Edison arranged for a death-row inmateto be put to death in an A/C powered electric chair. Edison’s minions alsokidnaped neighborhood cats and dogs and publicly electrocuted them using Tesla’salternating current. These stunts were rigged to prove how dangerousWestinghouse’s ideas were and to discredit Tesla’s A/C inventions. The executionwas a total disaster, Westinghouse’s reputation suffered, and Edison wasecstatic.Tesla and Edison were rivals but not sworn enemies. Tesla and Edison were onopposite sides of the electrical spectrum with Edison pushing for direct currentor D/C and Tesla championing alternating current or A/C. On very rare occasions,Edison would attend a conference where Tesla was the headline speaker. Edison,who was hard of hearing and not wanting notoriety, slipped into the back of theauditorium to listen to Tesla’s speech. At one convention, Tesla spotted Edisonin the crowd and called attention to him. Tesla led the audience in givingEdison a standing ovation. When Tesla lost a laboratory due to fire, Edisonprovided him with temporary use of a lab. There had to be some mutual respectfor these two men to help each other.In November of 1890, Tesla performed a laboratory experiment that was veryspecular. He was investigating the behavior of high-frequency currents.Believing that an electric field of sufficient intensity could be produced tolight up electrodeless vacuum tubes, he built a transformer to test the theory.The first test was an instant success. Tesla wrote in his journal, “It isdifficult to appreciate what those strange phenomena meant at the time. We cravefor new sensations, but soon become indifferent to them. The wonders ofyesterday are today common occurrences. When my tubes were first publiclyexhibited, they were viewed with amazement impossible to describe. From allparts of the world, I received urgent invitations and numerous honors and otherflattering inducements were offered to me, which I declined,” (T, N., 2011).THE WORLD’S FAIR OF 1893Westinghouse and Tesla struggled against Edison to convince the public of thesafety of A/C power over D/C. Westinghouse’s faith in the A/C system influencedthe founding of Westinghouse Electric Company beginning in 1886. With hiscompany now formed and Tesla in his court, Westinghouse deliberately underbidand won the contract to illuminate the Chicago World’s Fair that was to be heldin May of 1893. Chicago was the first all-electric fair in history. Also calledthe Columbian Exposition, this exposition was to be a celebration of the 400thAnniversary of Columbus discovering America.Move quickly forward to the World’s Fair in 1893. President Grover Clevelandswitched a switch, and up to a hundred thousand glowing lamps lit up thefairground. The City of Light was powered by Tesla and Westinghouse’s twelve,thousand-horsepower A/C generation units residing in the Hall of Machinery.Tesla’s polyphase system of alternating current power generation was displayedin the Great Hall of Electricity, and the twenty-seven million people whoattended the fair declared that A/C was the power of the future.HARNESSING NIAGARA FALLSSince his childhood, Tesla had dreamed of harnessing the power of Niagara Falls.He had his chance when Niagara Falls Power awarded the project to Westinghouselate in 1893.[Image00008.jpg] Westinghouse and Tesla won the project because all the othersolicited proposals had been rejected. Power plant schemes ranged from a systemusing pneumatic pressure to one requiring ropes and pulleys. There were alsoproposals to transmit D/C electricity (endorsed by Edison), but the heads of thecommission had been at the Chicago World’s Fair and were convinced A/C power wasthe way of the future.The construction of the power house was a harrowing feat for mechanics, workers,and engineers. It depended on investors that included J.P. Morgan, John JacobAstor, Lord Rothschild and W.K. Vanderbilt. After more than five years offinancial crisis, infighting and doubt, the project was completed. Tesla hadenvisioned the results in his mind, and he knew that when the switch was thrown,Buffalo, New York would light up. The investors were very unsure, and veryafraid the project would be a failure and they would be bankrupt. Theirreputations and money were on the line. At midnight November 16, 1896 Buffalo,New York lit up. Tesla was in awe and said, “The turning of a switch in the bigpowerhouse at Niagara completed a circuit that caused the Niagara River to flowuphill,” (Tessco, 2014).Niagara was a success, but Westinghouse and the General Electric Corporationwere financially drained. Years of litigation, Edison’s company being bought andsold and the financial teetering of Westinghouse contributed to a near takeover.One of the most ruthless Robber Barons, J.P. Morgan hoped to bring all U.S.hydroelectric power under his control. He manipulated stock markets forces withthe intention of taking over Westinghouse’s company and buying out Tesla’spatents.Tesla would have been one of the wealthiest men in America if he had held on tohis patents or sold them to J.P. Morgan. But Tesla had more integrity andemotional feelings than financial sense. He worked with Westinghouse to providean escape from the initial contract giving Tesla generous royalties. Tesla feltthat Westinghouse Electric had believed in his A/C invention, and they deservedloyalty. Tesla, who made a history–making gesture, tore up the contract. TheWestinghouse Electric Company was saved, and Tesla was reduced to continuingwith financial difficulties.Tesla was a brilliant inventor, but he was a terrible businessman. CHAPTER V: THE TESLA COIL, RADIO WAVES AND WEATHER “The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane tothink clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.” ~ N.Tesla Tesla never rushed into actual production with his inventions. When he receivedan idea, he built it up in his imagination, changed the construction, madeimprovements and operated the device in his mind. He could see if everything wasin balance. Once he felt his invention was perfect, he turned his inventionsinto concrete products. His experiments and devices always came out how heimagined. Tesla said, “Twenty times I have imagined success and twenty times Ihave won that success.”[Image00009.jpg] THE TESLA COILOne of Tesla’s most enduring inventions is the Tesla coil or a resonanttransformer that is used to produce high-voltage and low current plus highfrequency alternating current electricity. It steps up A/C voltages from low tohigh and at high frequencies. The coil uses a low kilohertz and a double tunedcircuit to transfer energy between two systems. The Tesla coil quickly proved tobe capable of transmitting radio signals, as well as x-ray generation,electrotherapy, and transmission of electrical energy without wires (Hardesty,2013). It is a high-frequency air-core transformer. Tesla coils create extremelypowerful electrical fields. Large coils have lit up florescent lights up to 50feet away. Tesla worked on and perfected the Tesla coil from 1885 to 1890.The initial impulse is very powerful—all the energy stored over severalmicroseconds is released in a rush. The impulse itself is transformed to asomewhat higher voltage in passing from the primary coil windings to those ofits secondary. This, of course, completes but a single cycle in the circuit'soperation. The air gap restores itself as an insulator, and the capacitor beginsto charge until it reaches a breakdown value once again. The whole process canrepeat itself many thousand times per second (Tessco, 2014).MARCONI AND TESLA’S RADIOIt’s interesting to note that in 1901 Guglielmo Marconi, from his laboratory inEngland, used the Tesla’s coil system to transmit Morse code across theAtlantic. Everything Marconi did was based on Tesla’s work. When told aboutMarconi's experiments, Tesla quipped, “Marconi is a good fellow. Let himcontinue. He is using seventeen of my patents.” As a note, the Marconi site onCape Cod specifically states that Marconi used the Tesla oscillator to send hissignals. Although Marconi did not “invent” the technology, he did build thefirst practical radio equipment and is credited with the invention of radio.Today coils resembling Tesla’s are used in radios and the entertainment field.They are also used in various wireless transmitters.In November of 1890, Tesla developed the first neon and fluorescentilluminations. He took the first x-ray photographs. He discovered anilluminating vacuum tube that transmitted energy through the air. Tesla’sobsession with wireless transmissions and radio waves were ramping up.ELECTRICITY AND WEATHERUsing radio waves Tesla thought it might be possible to modify the weather. Hereceived anomalous radio signals through his transmitters, and in June of 1900said, “The time is very near when we shall have the precipitation of themoisture of the atmosphere under complete control…” (Swartz, 2000). Tesla, afterhearing strange voices over his modified radio receiver, started to experimentwith electricity and the weather. He suggested using giant magnifyingtransmitters to act as global generators. These transmitters could artificiallycreate the same global electric circuit function that is created naturally bythunderstorms. If you believe that this sounds very science-fiction, rememberthat in 1976 the Soviets began broadcasting huge, pulsed electromagnetic fieldsfrom 40-million watt transformers. They beamed these signals halfway around theworld to the U.S. and North America. The resulting electronic assault jammedradio and televisions signals and enraged the FCC. Originally theseelectromagnetic fields and transmitters were designed to bring more rain toSiberia. The Soviets were surprised to find their electromagnetic signalsdisrupted weather and broadcasts all over North America. This is an example ofTesla’s experiments with electricity and weather taken to a very high plateau.His lectures and inventions came to a halt for a time in 1892 when his motherpassed away on April 4th. He arrived just hours before her death. Her last wordsto him were, “You’ve arrived, Midzo, my pride.” Tesla fell quite ill after herdeath and spent three weeks recuperating in Gospić.HIS MOTHER’S PASSINGHe did recover enough to give a lecture about alternating currents and theconstruction of a hydroelectric generating station in Zagreb. Later that year hewent to Belgrade and discussed his electrical theories. “There is somethingwithin me that might be illusion as it is often case with young delightedpeople, but if I would be fortunate to achieve some of my ideals, it would be onthe behalf of the whole of humanity. If those hopes would become fulfilled, themost exiting thought would be that it is a deed of a Serb. Long live Serbdom!”(Tesla Timeline, 2014). After spending some time in his mother’s homeland, Teslaleft for New York and moved into a hotel located just a few blocks from MadisonSquare Garden. CHAPTER VI: COLORADO SPRINGS “It is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering – only expensive –blind, faint-hearted, doubting world.” ~ N. Tesla Tesla moved to Colorado Springs in May of 1899. He needed room for hishigh-voltage and high-frequency experiments. Tesla felt that it was possible totransmit electrical power without wires if one were at high enough altitudes. Inhigher altitudes, the air is thinner and more conductive.A patent lawyer and good friend, Leonard E. Curtis, found land for a lab andtower, and negotiated for power from the El Paso Power Company of ColoradoSprings. John Jacob Astor contributed $30,000 for experiments and Tesla beganbuilding a new experimental station near Pikes Peak. He brought with him severalassistants who did not know what was going on, but who were excited to work withhim.[Image00010.jpg] Tesla arrived in Colorado Springs in May of 1899 and begantaking measurements of Colorado’s incredible lightening displays. He felt theearth was alive with electrical vibrations. Tesla hypothesized when lightningstruck the ground, powerful waves moved from one side of the earth to the other.He believed the earth was a conductor. With this thought in mind, Teslahypothesized he could transmit unlimited amounts of power to any place on earth.All he needed to do was create electrical effects on the scale of lightning.He wired up his weird and wonderful lab and created a roof that rolled back toprevent the roof and lab from catching fire. There was a wooden tower that roseeighty feet above the ground. Situated on the top of the tower was a 142 footmetal mast supporting a huge copper ball. Inside the lab, technicians were busyassembling an enormous Tesla coil.Tesla’s main experiment with electricity was ready to go, and Tesla motioned tohis mechanic, Czito, to open the switch for a brief second. The coil began tosparkle and crack, and an eerie blue corona formed in the air. Huge arcs of blueelectricity snaked up and down the center coil, and bolts of man-made lightningmore than a hundred feet in length shot out the top of the station. Thisexperiment burned out the dynamo at the El Paso Electric Company, and the entirecity of Colorado Springs lost power.He investigated atmospheric electricity by observing lightning signals via hisreceivers. He observed stationary waves and watched lightning storms. Teslabelieved that the earth had a resonant frequency or a tendency to oscillate withgreater amplitude at some frequencies versus others. The relative maximum offrequencies is known as a system’s resonant frequency, (Ogata, 2005.) Teslamapped these frequencies.In the Colorado laboratory, Tesla attempted to transmit extra-low frequencysignals through the space between the surface of the earth and the ionosphere.He felt that the resonant frequency of this area was about 8-hertz. No one paidmuch attention to this idea until the 1950s when Tesla’s ideas were reopened.Researchers found that the resonant frequency of the area between earth and theionosphere is, in fact, in the range of 8-hertz.His third experiment for wireless power was to transmit electrical power to anarea 80-kilometers above the earth. This was the ionosphere. Tesla felt thisregion of the atmosphere was highly conductive. He was correct. He only neededthe technical devices to send electrical power to such a high altitude.Tesla spent night after night in his laboratory listening to frequencies andconducting experiments. One night he noticed a signal that kept repeatingitself. Tesla believed this signal was a message from aliens. Although he wasridiculed when he announced this discovery, he was actually the first man todetect radio waves from space (PBS, 2014).It is still very vague as to exactly what Tesla was doing in his ColoradoSprings lab. What were the instructions in transmitting wireless power? He lovedhis Colorado Spring lab and the time spent there; he felt it offered himwide-open space to invent and create. However, he did eventually return with hisnotebooks to New York City; believing he would reach a solution to accomplishwireless energy transmission.CHAPTER VII: MORE INVENTIONS, MORE EXPERIMENTS AND MORE ELECTRICITY “I do not think there is any thrill that can ago through the human heart likethat felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding tosuccess… Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love,everything.” ~ N. Tesla Tesla invented the carbon button lamp or a single electrode incandescent lampthat held a small carbon sphere in the center of a glass bulb. The lamp used A/Cand needed an electric arc to produce a high current around the carbonelectrode. The carbon electrode was lit up by collisions with ions that are theelectric current. [Image00011.jpg] ROENTGEN AND TESLA’S X-RAYSWhen working on this carbon-button lamp, Tesla noted a very special radiation.He produced pictures called shadowgraphs and performed experiments withradiation rays. Before he could be totally successful his equipment andexperiments were destroyed in a fire at his lab. Wilhelm Roentgen, his friend,went on to discover x-rays and Tesla sent him some of the pictures he recoveredfrom the lab fire. Roentgen requested collaboration from Tesla and the x-raymachine was created.Tesla proceeded to do more experiments in x-ray imaging, and he developed ahigh-energy single terminal vacuum tube. This tube had no target electrode andworked from the output of the Tesla Coil. He stated, “The instrument will …enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable withordinary apparatuses,” (N. Tesla, 2014).Tesla noticed that using x-rays caused damaged skin. He attributed this skindamage to the ozone generated in contact with the skin and by nitrous acid. Ofcourse, this thinking was later proved to be wrong. It is the radiation in thex-rays themselves that cause the damage.RADIO CONTROL AT THE ELECTRICAL EXPOSITIONThe Electrical Exposition at Madison Square Garden in New York City was anopportunity to demonstrate the potential of his wireless transmission system.Madison Square Garden had only recently been finished and Tesla wowed the crowdswith the first radio-controlled vessel. Everyone expected something great fromTesla, but this was an unexpected invention. The boat was equipped with “aborrowed mind” (Tesla, 2014). The boat moved around the water and red lightsflashed on and off. The crowd thought Tesla was controlling the boat with hismind, but he was actually sending wireless signals to the mechanism using ahand-held control box and battery power.Tesla did not limit his wireless remote control to boats but included vehiclesof any sort and for any purpose. He envisioned one operator simultaneouslydirecting hundreds of machines through different tuned radio transmitters andreceivers. Tesla knew this would happen sometime in the future.When a New York Times writer suggested that Tesla could make the boat submergeand carry dynamite as a weapon of war, Tesla exploded. Tesla quickly correctedthe reporter, \"You do not see there a wireless torpedo, you see there the firstof a race of robots, mechanical men that will do the laborious work of the humanrace,” (Tesla, 2014).BACK TO NEW YORKTesla ventured into the alternative medicine field with his patent for a coronadischarge ozone generator. It was charged via metal plates by A/C on ambientair. The Tesla Ozone Company was formed and went into ozone production. Most ofTesla’s clients were naturopaths and allopaths who brought ozone therapy intotheir practices. The remedy consisted of breathing ozone bubbles through oliveoil. Tesla's ideas were to produce a gel made by bubbling ozone through oliveoil until it solidified.Realizing that he needed money, Tesla signed over 51% interest in his patentsand inventions, including electric lighting and wireless telegraphy for a mere$150,000. In 1901, he watched his rival Guglielmo Marconi succeed in sending thefirst radio transmission across the Atlantic Ocean. The Morse code signal forthe letter “s” traveled more than 2,000 miles from Poldhu in Cornwall toNewfoundland, Canada.Smartphones might have been available much sooner had Tesla’s ideas beenbelieved in and marketed. He described to his business partner, J.P. Morgan, ameans of instant communication that involved gathering telegram messages andfunneling them to his laboratory. Once he received the messages, he would encodethem and give them each a new frequency. Those frequencies would be broadcast toa device that fits in your hand. Tesla envisioned the smartphone and wirelessinternet. “He was the first to be thinking about the information revolution inthe sense of delivering information to each user,” (Jacobson, 2013). In 1901, Tesla began the construction of a wireless telecommunications tower inShoreham, New York. This tower was intended to be a point of commercialtrans-Atlantic wireless communications, broadcasting and intended to transmittelephony, message and facsimile images from New York to England. It was hisintention to compete with Marconi.The project was financed by J.P. Morgan, but Morgan did not like the idea thatthe Tesla tower could not be metered, and power sold. He was angry with Tesla’s“secret” experiments. Morgan pulled his financing and because of financialconcerns, the tower was never completed (nikolatesla.com, 2014). Tesla began his foray into the automobile industry in 1906. He was contracted bythe Waltham Watch Company to build the world’s first air-friction speedometer.His patented device was used in Packers, Lincolns, and Pierce-Arrow luxury cars.He also announced his bladeless turbine to the world. The invention was based onadhesion and viscosity, the two fundamental properties of fluids.1907, Tesla changed his office location to 1 Liberty Plaza and lobbied forinvestors to look at his vertical take-off and landing aircraft. “You should notbe at all surprised if someday you see me fly from New York to Colorado Springsin a contrivance which will resemble a gas stove and weigh almost as much,”(Rayl, 2006). Tesla envisioned the helicopter.In 1909, Tesla was overlooked when the Nobel Prize for physics was jointlyrewarded Guglielmo Marconi and Karl Ferdinand Braun for “recognition of theircontributions to the development of wireless telegraphy.” He began a long battleto right this wrong, and be the one recognized for wireless transmission.Tesla tested many models of steam turbines at the Waterside Station of the NewYork Edison Company. He stated in an interview, “In one of them the disks areonly nine inches in diameter, and the whole working part is two inches thick.With steam and the propulsive fluid, it developed 110 horsepower and could dotwice as much,” (Tesla Timeline, 2014).Tesla received a blow in 1912 when the Titanic sank. His wealthiest and mostgenerous investor John Jacob Astor died. Astor had invested $100,000 for Teslato develop and produce a new lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the funds toinvest in his Colorado Springs experiments. Mr. Astor was unhappy with thisdeception and avoided Tesla for many years. They later reconciled and workedtogether on aircraft and propulsion systems.Tesla was once again tapped for the prestigious Nobel Prize. Reuter’s NewsAgency reported that the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics would be awarded to ThomasEdison and Nikola Tesla. However, later in November a Reuter’s story stated thatthe prize had actually been awarded to Sir William Henry Bragg and WilliamLawrence Bragg “for their service in the analysis of crystal structure by meansof x-rays,” (Cheney, 2001).Tesla manifested his slow fall into mental illness when in 1917 he was beingawarded the Edison Medal and disappeared during his introduction. Tesla waslater found at the library feeding his beloved pigeons. Bernard A. Behrendpersuaded him to return and give his acceptance speech.More genius ideas came from Tesla. In 1917, he invented radar. He discussed thisidea with the U.S. Navy at the beginning of WWI, but Thomas Edison, who was thehead of Research and Development for the U.S. Navy, managed to convince the warcommittee that radar had no practical application.Additionally, in September 1917 the Wardenclyffe/Tesla tower was blown up by theUnited States Government. The government feared German spies would use thetower, and that it could be used as a connecting point for German submarines.The scrap was sold to pay off Tesla’s debts.BROKE AGAINTesla was penniless and owed taxes plus back rent, yet; he was still highlyregarded as a genius albeit a mad scientist. In 1919 Electrical started a seriesof articles entitled “My Inventor” by Tesla. His picture was featured on thecover of the issue, and he was persuaded to write his autobiography. Thearticles in the Electrical Experimenter were converted into a book with the sametitle.Tesla was known to care for the pigeons of New York. He went so far to as to aska chef at the Hotel New Yorker to prepare a special mix of seed for his pigeons.He hoped to sell this mix commercially. Tesla had one pigeon he particularly heloved. She was soft white with gray stripes on her wings. One night she flewinto Tesla’s room at the Hotel St. Regis and Tesla knew she was dying. Heclaimed that a light came from her eyes more intense than any electrical beam hehad produced. The bird died shortly after that, and Tesla claimed at that momenthe knew his life’s work was finished.In 1926, Tesla received a doctorate from the University of Belgrade and on the29th of June he received another doctorate from the University of Zagreb. Healso met his nephew in 1926 who was a diplomat with the title of Ambassador ofthe Federal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia. Mr. Kosanovic would later play avery important part of Tesla’s life.Tesla turned in his final patent in 1928 for this unique method of transportingpeople through the air. He described an open box-type craft with a tiltingpropeller and wing that would enable the vehicle to rise vertically and flyhorizontally. Yet again, Tesla was before his time with visions of verticaltake-off aircraft with tilt-rotors and wings to harness the advantages of bothhelicopters and airplanes.[Image00012.jpg] Tesla moved to the New Yorker Hotel where he would live rentfree for the rest of his life. He bargained to be a consultant for theWestinghouse Corporation, who paid him $125.00 per month plus free rent. Hecontinued to invent, and although he was very reclusive, he published an articlein the Scientific America featuring a two-million volt Van de Graf generator andcontinued lecturing and speaking at conventions.THE DEATH RAYSupporters and detractors of Nikola Tesla claimed that at 78 years old, he wasworking on a “Death Ray.” The press claimed that this weapon was so powerful itcould obliterate military targets from hundreds of miles away. Tesla’sdescription of the “teleforce” weapon states, “[The nozzle would] sendconcentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energythat they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200miles from a defending nation's border and will cause armies to drop dead intheir tracks,” (Harris, 2014).In 1937, Tesla wrote a treatise, The Art of Projecting ConcentratedNon-Dispersive Energy through the Natural Media. This treatise discussed chargedparticle beam weapons. Tesla believed that this document would give thescientific community the technical description of a “super weapon that would putan end to all war.”GLIMPSES INTO TIME TRAVELIn an effort to rid the world or war Tesla continued his work. However, throughthese experiments Tesla discovered that a doorway in time and space could becreated. Tesla came in contact with the resonating electromagnetic charge andfound himself outside time. He could see the immediate past, present and futureall at one time. However, he was paralyzed inside the electromagnet field andcould not speak or move. Fortunately his assistant turned off the current andTesla was released before his brain could be permanently damaged.Move back to1895 when Tesla conducted research with his step-up transformer. Hesaw that time and space could move by using highly charged and rotating magneticfields. His experiments with radio frequencies and the transmission ofelectrical energy through the atmosphere was the basis of this experiment.Although this discovery came about in a very simple way, years later (1943) itled to the Philadelphia Experiment and the Montauk time travel projects.The Philadelphia Experiment was an alleged military exercise that was begun atthe U.S. Navy shipyard in Philadelphia. In theory large electrical generatorsbend light around an object to rend it invisible. Supposedly the U.S.S. Eldridgewas “cloaked”, and moved from Philadelphia to Norfolk Virginia in the blink ofan eye. The crew was found crazed and the ship undamaged. Did it really happen?The Navy denies any such experiment.CHAPTER VIII: TESLA DIES AND LEAVES AN INCREDIBLE LEGACY “ The practical success of an idea, irrespective of its inherent merit, isdependent on the attitude of the contemporaries. If timely it is quicklyadopted; if not, it is apt to fare like a sprout lured out of the ground by warmsunshine, only to be injured and retarded in its growth by the succeedingfrost.” ~ N. Tesla On January 8th, 1943, a maid found Tesla dead in his bed. He had been dead forover 24 hours. The cause of death was listed as coronary thrombosis, and therewere no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.Tesla held over 300 U.S. patents and was the father of modern electricity. Hedeveloped alternating current which is the electrical power used today. However,the inventor, died impoverished and in relative obscurity. [Image00013.jpg] With a penniless estate, Tesla once again relied on friends tohelp him through. A sculpture or the death mask was commissioned by a long-timefriend and supporter of Tesla. This mask can be seen at the Nikola Tesla Museumin Belgrade, Serbia.Just a few months after Tesla’s death, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor toTesla contentions that he was the father of radio. Perhaps the U.S. governmentgave this honor to Tesla in order to avoid paying royalties to Marconi for usinghis patents. However, the ruling was overturned.In 1945, the U.S. Air Force began a death beam program at Patterson Air ForceBase in Dayton, Ohio. Project “Nick” opened renewed interest in the ultimateweapon to end all wars. Copies of Tesla’s papers on particle beams weaponry weresent to the Air Force, and the project was heavily funded. Brigadier GeneralL.C. Craige was to test the feasibility of Tesla’s death ray. The experimentswere never published, and the project was discontinued. Instead, all copies ofTesla’s paper on this “beam” and many other papers and inventions havedisappeared and have never been found.Speculation continues to surround Tesla’s death beam experiments and papers. In1970, there was fear that the Soviets may have Tesla's papers and had achieved abreakthrough. The U.S., however, after half a century of research and billionsof dollars in investments, considered the death beam program a failure. PerhapsTesla knew how to accurately project lethal beams of energy through theatmosphere, and if he did, he might have taken all the information with him tothe grave.TESLA’S LEGACYTesla’s papers and the entire estate were shipped to Belgrade in 1952. Thecontents included original papers and hundreds of correspondences going back andforth with Edison, Westinghouse, and other notables. There were also photographsand some of Tesla’s later inventions including the remote controlled boat,wireless fluorescent lamps, motors, and turbines. All of Tesla’s papers weregiven to the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. It was his nephew Sava Kosanovicwho lobbied to obtain Tesla’s estate after his death.Honor after honor has followed Tesla after his death. In 1960, the symbol T (forTesla) was given to a unit of magnetic flux density. Tesla is only one of threeAmerican’s who have been honored with a permanent symbol on a scientificformula. He is also the only scientist to have a rock band named after him. Moveto 2013 when Tesla Motors named their company “Tesla” to honor Nikola Tesla.Their first electric car, The Tesla Roadster uses an A/C induction motorpatented by Tesla in 1888. Recognition has come slowly for this amazing man andhis contributions. In nearly every case, he was found to be a visionary genius,whose primary objective was not to capitalize upon his inventions, but ratherimprove the human condition. CONCLUSION “The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is themost important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is thecomplete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forcesof nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who isoften misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in thepleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of thatexceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long agoperished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements. Speaking for myself,I have already had more than my full measure of this exquisite enjoyment; somuch, that for many years my life was little short of continuous rapture. I amcredited with being one of the hardest workers and perhaps I am, if thought isthe equivalent of labour, for I have devoted to it almost all of my wakinghours. But if work is interpreted to be a definite performance in a specifiedtime according to a rigid rule, then I may be the worst of idlers.” ~ N. TeslaFollowers and admirers of Nikola Tesla claim he is “the greatest geek who everlived.” Interesting observation. Geeks never sleep but disassemble the world sothey can discover what makes it run. Geeks tend to tinker with things that arenot broken, and they abandon the world around them in favor of their inventions.Perfect descriptions of a man who was born one century too early.At a time when man was lighting his world by candles, an electrical system knownas alternating current was discovered by Nikola Tesla. He patented thisinventions plus added over 300 inventions to the U.S. patent list.Someone who should have been very wealthy, died a recluse and a pauper. ”It’s asad, sad story,” Larry Page, Google’s co-founder, said of Tesla in a 2008interview with Forbes magazine. “[Tesla} couldn’t commercialize anything hecould barely fund his own research” (Bio, 2015).He is rapidly gaining recognition as one of history’s greatest inventors. Hiseccentricities are as legendary as his discoveries in the field of electricity.Finally, a cult is beginning to take hold and recognize this genius as aninventor extraordinaire. The decades-old debate about who should be known as thegreatest inventor of all time, Tesla or Edison, still rages.Tesla’ quirky personality and his far-out ideas earned him a reputation forbeing a mad scientist. Some point to pictures of Tesla in his Coloradolaboratory with lightning raging all around him as he sits calmly in his chairto prove that he is \"crazy.\" His work with a death beam or bending time andspace certainly makes Tesla seem a bit on the “mad” side.He spent decades as a New Yorker and to commemorate his connection to New York,the intersection of 40th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan is named NikolaTesla Corner. A plaque can be found on the façade of the New Yorker Hotel wherehe died in Room 3327. “Money does not represent such a value as men have placed upon it. All my moneyhas been invested into experiments with which I have made new discoveriesenabling mankind to have a little easier life.” ~ N. Tesla REFERENCES Cheney. M. (1981). Tesla, Man out of time.
