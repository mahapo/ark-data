M y purpose in re-publishing these two volumes, which document his meticulous research into oscillation and its va rious manifestations, is to make sure that Hans Jen ny's unique perspective does not fade into obscurity. One might well ask \"what's so fascinating about wat ching a bunch of pastes, powders and liquids being bounced, prodded and jiggled around?\" And why has interest i n this obscure branch of phenomenology continued to grow even though the books have long since gone out of print, the publisher gone out of business, and the author passed away nearly thirty years ago!?! As you will see in these pages, not only was Dr. Je nny uncompromising in his methodology, but also in his discipline of always inquiring anew, of maintaining his \"questing eye\" unconstrained by doctrine, scie ntific or other- wise. A keen observer whose hawk-like intensity of focus was unclouded by the need to prove a theory, he, like Goethe whom he so greatly admired, learned by \"pure observation\" of Nature. This was not a technique, but an essential aspect of his character. Further insights into this remarkable man are provided in the Forew ord by his long- time friend and associate, Christiaan Stuten. Because Jenny's experiments were so thorough and ex acting, and so well documented, this body of work, which he named Cymatics after the Greek ta kymatika, \"mat ters pertaining to waves,\" could easily be applied to other fields. In fact, the principle underlying Cymatics, that of periodicity, is so ubiquitous in nature (and in Na ture), that it is found in all manner of phenomena. So here we have documentation of the highest calibe r, of one of the most fundamental phenomena of matt er — vibration, or from the perspective of the life scie nces, pulsation. Relevance to the medical professio n is obvious, as all physiological processes exhibit this quality of per iodicity. It is for this reason that I have include d a commentary by John Beaulieu, N.D., Ph.D., which relates the relev ance of Cymatics to the field of vibrational medici ne. Personally, I am grateful to have had this opportun ity to prepare these works for re-publication. What a gift it has been to pore over both volumes word by word, correc ting misprints and searching for the perfect nuance to convey the intended meaning in what was sometimes overly c omplex syntax, or perhaps a little-too-literal tran slation from the original German. It is more than a bit ironic that over the past 15 years or so, I have sold thousands of the Cymatics books (Vol. II), and this without ever having read the book in its entirety! It was 1983 when I got my first glimpse into the wo rld of Cymatics, My introduction came via a video c lip of one of the films which Dr. Jenny had made documenting some of the very experiments detailed in this volume. E ven though this video was barely legible, I was immediately aw estruck. I was particularly fascinated by one aston ishing image of what appeared to be a snake, slowly undulating on s creen, but stripped right down to its vertebrae. Wh at was so amazing was that this was neither a reptile, nor wa s it even alive. What I was witnessing was a small pool of glycerin being \"animated\" by sound! The imaginary snake was actually light reflecting off a series of wave trai ns creating this delicate, flowing form in the vibrating liquid. 8"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"There were other images which mirrored biological f orms and natural processes, as well as flowers, man dalas and intricate geometric designs — all this the resu lt of audible vibration. These experiments seemed t o reveal the hidden nature of creation, to lay bare the very pri nciple through which matter coalesces into form. It is no wonder to me that today, Dr. Jenny's exper iments with cymatics are finding a wider and more e nthusiastic audience than ever before. It is easy to look at th e pictures, read a few captions, and let the imagin ation run witd. This is one approach that I know well. But there is also much to be gained in really studying the principle s which underlie this body of exploration, and in contempla ting what might well be Dr. Jenny's greatest legacy : that while the phenomenal world has much to teach, one must st rive to penetrate the surface level of appearance, and not be too quick to judge as \"cause\" that which is merely \"effect\".

This takes some deliberate and focused concentration, but in e ven flipping through these pages you will quickly s ee that the experiments portrayed herein, as well as Dr. Jennys depth and breadth of understanding, more than meri t the effort! I also wish to acknowledge the enormous contributio n which Dr. Jenny has made to the emerging fields o f \"Sound Healing\" and \"Energy Medicine.\" Although he was a m edical doctor, it was never his intention that this work be applied therapeutically. Rather, he wished to demonstrate t he primacy of vibration and its ever-present effect s throughout the entirety of nature. Through his painstaking experim entation and acute observation, he was able to arti culate a concep- tual basis which may very well prove fundamental th roughout the broad reach of scientific endeavor. I first became aware of Dr. Jenny's work in 1974 wh en I was working at Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital i n New York City as Supervisor of Music Therapy. A fellow thera pist placed a copy of Cymatics, Vol. I on my desk. I remember the joy of looking at the cymatic sound patterns, and t he wonderful sense of \"Yes!\" that rippled through m y being. Each picture was worth at least a thousand words and I f elt as though I were reading volumes in just a few minutes. As I read the Cymatics book. I realized that Dr. Je nny was a dedicated systems researcher and I found his writing just as exciting as the cymatic images! My graduate studies and work at Bellevue Hospital were based o n applied systems theory. I also studied mathematical music c omposition with Innas Xenakis and a systems approac h to therapeutic program planning. I will say more about Dr. Jenny's systems approach later. Having shared and taught Cymatics for over twenty f ive years I know that many who are attracted to Dr. Jenny's work are artistic and \"right brain\" by nature. They are immediately inspired by the beauty of his cyma tic pictures and can sense instantly what they mean. Using their ima ginative capacities; they are able to extrapolate b road implica- tions to his research. Yet Dr. Jenny's writings are pure \"left brain\" scie nce. He sets forth a thorough phenomenological stud y of vibra- tion befitting an accomplished physicist and system s researcher. From a scientific perspective Dr. Jen ny's written words form a beautiful mosaic which is just as prof ound as his cymatic pictures. His cymatic writings are embedded in rigor and clarity and supported by exacting meth odology and procedure. He is constantly seeking to observe the integrity of the whole, and to document its behavio r through phenomenological categories. I remember when I first showed Dr. Jenny's work to a group of New York composers and musicians. I star ted by explaining how the pictures were made, in about two minutes, which was their right brain theory time l imit before they became restless. Next, we viewed slides of cymatic photographs. Everyone said words like \"wow\", \"far o ut\", \"yeah\", \"ummm\". After the presentation I asked for question s. Everyone just sat there in what I took to be an appreciative silence. No one had any questions, and then they we nt home. This was my first \"Music and Sound in the Healing A rts\" class and I didn't know what to think, so I ju st went along with the energy. To my surprise I came home to an a nswering machine filled with questions. I continued to get questions for the rest of the week, and to this day I occasionally get questions about Dr. Jenny's wor k from students of that very class! Sooner or later the other side of our brain says \"what about me?\" and wants to kno w. So twenty-five 10 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"years of hearing \"wows\" followed by \"hows\" has insp ired me to write this commentary. It is my intention to attempt to communicate the es sence of Dr. Jenny's work based on years of \"right brain- students' questions. I am not seeking scientific pr ecision. If you are scientific by nature and want s cience, I suggest that you dive right into Dr. Jenny's research. My g oal is to heip artists and creative people not vers ed in science and systems theory to come to a better understanding of this material. Through this understanding, it is m y hope that they will have an even greater and more balanced appreci ation of what Dr. Jenny has given us. Dr. Jenny's Cymatic Experiments Dr. Jenny performed many of his experiments by putt ing substances such as sand, fluids, and powders on a metal plate. The plate was attached to an oscillato r and the oscillator was controlled by a frequency generator capable of producing a broad range of vibrations. T hrough turning a dial on the frequency generator Dr . Jenny would cause the plate to vibrate at different frequencies . (See photo of Dr. Jenny at work, on page 6.) Let me explain. Oscillators are devices which produce vibrations. T hey are often called \"vibrators\" in the popular mar ket place. A massage device is a simple oscillator. Imagine any popular electric massage device or go to most any d epartment store and ask to see their massagers. Turn it on an d it will vibrate or oscillate. Next place the mass ager on a bone. Feel how the vibrations are amplified over your bod y. Touching the rnassager to your bone is like Dr. Jenny attaching his oscillator to a metal plate. The plate, like yo ur bones, amplifies the vibrations of the oscillato r. A simple massage device creates only one vibration which can be heard as a hum. The hum you hear with your ears and vibration you feel from the massager are t he same. In contrast to a massage device which is c apable of only one vibration/sound, Dr. Jenny's oscillator hooked to a frequency generator was capable of thousands o f different vibrations/sounds. Dr. Jenny could turn a dial and instantly change th e vibrations moving through the plate. He could obs erve the effect of different vibrations on different substan ces. When Dr. Jenny watched the sand or other subst ances on the metal plate organize into different patterns, he co uld also hear the sound produced by the oscillator. If he were to lightly touch the plate he would feel the vibration in his fingertips. Dr. Jenny observed three fundamental principles at work in the vibratory field on the plate. He wrote, \"Since the various aspects of these phenomena are due to vibra tion, we are confronted with a spectrum which revea ls a pat- terned, figurative formation at one pole and kineti c-dynamic processes at the other, the whole being g enerated and sustained by its essential periodicity.\" What Dr. Jenny is saying is that one can hear the s ound as a wave; he calls this the pole of kinetic-d ynamic process. One can see the pattern the sound creates in the plate; he calls this the pole of \"patterned- figurative forma- tion\". And if Dr. Jenny were to touch the plate and feel it's vibration, he would call this the genera ting pole of ''essential periodicicity\". [Editor's Note: Although the example given here inv olves three of our senses, Dr. Jenny stated that hi s objective was to make these effects visible, since our sense of sight is the most discriminating. He was emphati c that this \"triadic nature\" of vibration referenced above, com prised three essential aspects, or three ways of vi ewing, a unitary phenomenon.] 11"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Dr. Jenny's Scientific Approach Systems Theory unites science and art in a quest fo r holistic vision. It is a discipline where objecti vity and intuition meet, for one can not see the whole without this ki nd of vision. Dr. Jenny always sought to observe th e whole and to understand the behavior of parts in relationship to the whole. He says, \"What is the status of the par ts, the details, the single pieces, the fragments? In the vibrational fi eld it can be shown that every part is, in the true sense, implicated in the whole.\" A basic systems law is that the whole is greater th en the sum total of its parts. A common metaphor us ed to illustrate this systems law is that of a team of sc ientists studying an elephant. The problem is that the scientists have no idea they are working on an elephant. One scient ist is measuring the behavior of the foot, another scientist is measuring the velocity in which the tail wags, and another is observing the chemical composition of on e toenail, etc. These views are fragmented. Each is one publishing separate papers in prestigious scientific journals in different disciplines, yet they have no idea that their work is remotely related. One day a scientist comes along and accidentally \"s ees\" the whole. She calls the whole an \"elephant\". She sees the relationship of the parts to the whole and how they move together. Everyone thinks she is crazy an d the special- ists begin to fight over her idea of an \"elephant\". More and more people begin to see \"the elephant\" u ntil one day \"there is an elephant\" and many isolated areas of r esearch are explained in a larger context. Throughout his writings Dr. Jenny is always request ing that we focus on the whole and not get distract ed by the behavior of the parts. \"The three fields, the perio dic as the fundamental field with the two poles of figure and dynamic, invariably appear as one. They are inconceivable wi thout each other. It is quite out of the question t o take away the one or the other; nothing can be abstracted without the whole ceasing to exist. We cannot therefore nu mber them one, two, three, but can only say they are threefol d in appearance and yet unitary; that they appear a s one and yet are threefold.\" Cymatics and \"Vibrational Medicine\" Cymatics research is a \"sound\" example of the princ iples underlying vibrational medicine. If you were to be present during a cymatics experiment you would hear a sound and simultaneously see a pattern forming i n a sub- stance which had been placed on a vibrating membran e or perhaps a steel plate. What started out as an inert \"blob\" of sand or water, without movement, form, or pulse, would instantly transform into an animated, pulsat ing form as soon as the plate or membrane was excited by vibrat ion. All this would be generated by the vibrational field created by the oscillator. Now let us assume that for some reason you could on ly \"see\" the static aspect of the form and therefor e under- stood it to be solid. The idea of the form being ge nerated by a vibrational field and making a sound w ould seem preposterous. Now let's imagine that someone unknow ingly brushes the sand on the plate and the shape i s dis- turbed, but then in a matter of a few seconds it re turns to its original shape. How would you explain it? The above example illustrates the basic differences between conventional, materialistic medicine and e nergetic healing. Let me explain. \"Energy medicine\" seeks to understand people as unified energy fields or in D r. Jenny's words, \"as wholes\". Metaphorically, our physical bo dy, emotions, and thought processes are like cymati c forms which are organized by underlying vibrational fields, the densest (the physical), being animated by the subt ler vibrations (emotions and thoughts). 12"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"In energy medicine, the underlying vibrational fiel d is called an energy field. The health practitione r seeks to perceive, evaluate, and support the energy field ra ther than focus on a specific symptom. The practiti oner's goal is to use therapeutic modalities such as music, sound, to uch, homeopathics, acupuncture, tuning forks, voice , and color, to effect and change the energy field. As the perso n shifts into resonance with a more coherent field, their array of symptoms may disappear as a more harmonious pattern emerges. The idea of energy fields is both new and ancient. Physicists have sought to explain the strange behav ior of quantum particles through the existence of a unifie d field. \"We may therefore regard matter as being c onstituted by the regions of Space in which the field is extremel y intense....There is no place in this new kind of physics both for the field and matter, for the field is the only reality .\" (Albert Einstein) Dr. Jenny used phenomenology and systems theory as research vehicles to observe the effects of whole v ibra- tional fields. He wanted students of Cymatics to un derstand that the phenomena witnessed on the vibrat ing surface were always the product of a larger field, and that any change in the frequency of the vibrational fie ld would immedi- ately alter the phenomena being observed. In the latter chapters of Cymatics, Vol. II, Dr. Je nny sought to illustrate a connection between cymat ic vibrational fields and the behaviors of biological, weather and social systems. I believe that Dr. Jenny was not s aying that Cymatics was the cause — rather he was saying \"look at the whole and you will come to new understandin gs. Let these cymatic experiments inspire your imagination to deeper insights into the universal principles of Nature.\" The current environment within the healing arts is one of specialization and compartmentalization. In contrast, energy medicine takes a more generalized approach t o healing, based on the understanding of energy fie lds. When the energy medicine practitioner evaluates the ener gy field, he/she can recommend \"vibrational therapi es\" such as music, sounds, movements, colors, etc., to support a shift in the field. The result will be a new ener getic field in which the old symptoms can no longer exist. This is a \"transformation\" as opposed to \"fixing a part.\" The old energy field will still be available , yet we will now have developed the ability to shift into a newfield . Ultimately we learn that we have the freedom to c reate and choose different fields. Ideally we would find ourselves i n a continuum of fields, always observing and enter ing into a greater whole, a greater experience of wholeness! As I mentioned before, a fundamental tenet of syste ms theory is that \"the whole is greater then the su m total of its parts.\" Observation of the \"whole picture\" is a discipline to which Dr. Jenny dedicated himself, a s documented in Cymatics, Vols. I and II, We can learn from his ded ication. We can be inspired to see ourselves as \"wh oles\" with the capability to shift into different vibrational fiel ds at any time. Cymatics, from its widest purview, ultimately teaches us that we are limitless beings with immense creative and healing powers. Dr Jenny exhibited this in his own life — may you be so moved to experience this yourself, as you explore the vast implications of his work. 13"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Foreword by Christiaan Stuten As a life-long friend of Dr. Jenny, until his death in 1972, including 14 years assisting him with the fascinating experiments portrayed in these pages, it is with gr eat joy that I introduce this combined edition of h is two books on Cymatics, the study of wave formations. Hans Jenny was indeed a Renaissance man, his diverse callings woven together by his dynamic personality which was chara cterized by great intensity and a profound sense of competency in all thai he undertook. As a youngster, his affinity for music and skill at the piano made a career in music seem likely. His father held various positions in the evangelical church, and th roughout grammar school Hans would play organ for c hurch ser- vices. His tastes, however, were as broad as his ta lents and he was equally at ease improvising jazz a s performing a piano sonata. His musical aptitude overshadowed an indifference for church religion, although he did g ain a thorough knowledge of the bible during this time. He also de veloped a life-long interest, and formidable comman d of both classical and modem history, as well as becoming pr oficient in Greek and Latin. His love of the arts was evidenced by continuous st udy of the works of Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael, music through the works of Mozart and Wagner (as well as jazz), and philosophy via Plato, Aristotle, Heracli tus and Nietsche. The scientific approach of Goethe was also a powerf ul influence upon him. He was a tireless observer o f the natural world, especially animals. In later life, as a scie ntist and lecturer his travels took him all over th e world, and he never missed an opportunity to visit zoological gardens, whether in his hometown of Basel, Switzerland, or i n some distant city. He loved to travel, and had an insatiable des ire to really \"know\" the places he would visit. Two of his favorites were the Engardin in the town of St. Maurice in the Swiss Alps, and, quite appropriately, the town of Florence, Italy, which, in its day, was the center of the Renaissanc e. He was a most entertaining man whose sharp wit was tempered with heartfelt compassion. This was to ser ve him greatly in what was to become his primary professio n as a family physician in the village of Dornach. His practice spanned more than 30 years and ranged from making \" house calls\" to local farmers {occasionally even tr eating their animals), to seeing prominent socialites at his cli nic in the nearby city of Basel. With his breadth o f interest, sense of humor, and his positively magnetic personality, he could quickly develop rapport with just about anyon e, and his vibrancy was so infectious that no sooner did he en ter the room than his patients would feel better! One of his most prized possessions was a pair of bi noculars which his father had given him as a boy. T hough nothing fancy, he always carried them with him on h is many sojourns around the world. His keen eyes, s chooled in the Goethean mode of observing nature, were his pri mary tools in his relentless pursuit of the hidden laws of life. His acute perceptivity was already evident as a schoolb oy when he would go on ornithological excursions in the Swiss countryside outside of Basel. He quickly learned to recognize and identify every bird in the vicinity by both its appear- ance and its call! Since early childhood he had lik ed to draw and to paint, primarily animals and thei r environs. This \"hobby\"' grew to become an absolute inner necessity for him throughout his later life. He painted with oils on canvas, and also on composi tion board, the latter being larger images often 3' x 5' or greater. He never copied nature. Rather he would ab sorb impressions whose motifs would then gestate wi thin him, sometimes for years, until they emerged in a contro lled explosion of creativity, color and form. Even these larger works seldom took more than an hour or two for him to complete. 14"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Executed in a vital, expressive manner unique in th e realm of \"animal portraiture,\" his paintings capt ured the soul of the animal while at the same time reflecting pow erful archetypes within the psyche of man. The resu lting body of over two thousand paintings firmly established Jenn y as a fine artist with numerous exhibits throughou t Europe and as far afield as Argentina.* It was on one of these ornithological excursions bi cycling in the hills overlooking the Birs Valley ne ar Dornach, that the 14 year-old's gaze fell upon the first Goe theanum, a unique and impressive wooden structure b uilt under the inspiration and direction of Rudolf Steiner. The la d was fascinated by the twin-lobed structure, and a s late would have it, a short time later he accompanied his parents a nd a small group of educators and public officials on a guided tour of what was to become the locus of Anthroposophical teaching — a tour led by none other than Rudolf St einer himself! Thus began his study of Anthroposophy, a spiritual science with which he found particular affinity. As with his earlier experience with religion, he didn't always relate well with \"Anthroposophists\", but he greatly admired Steiner and read an enormous amount of his extensive writin gs. It was Steiner, with his emphasis on the super- sensible spiritual dimension of life, who was to influence J enny most profoundly, providing direction for his i nsatiable curiosity and a framework for his own inner strivings. Not surprisingly, Jenny proved a good student, and was already giving lectures on Anthroposophy before he had even finished medical school. After completing his doctorate he taught science at the Rudolf Steiner S chool in Zurich for four years before beginning his medical practic e. And even with a bustling practice, he still foun d time to keep up with the latest advances in the natural sciences, t o travel and lecture, and of course, to experiment in a whole new field of science, Cymatics! Dr. Jenny would frequently begin his lectures stati ng that he hoped that his research into Cymatics wo uld open the eyes of others to the underlying periodic pheno mena in nature, which he so clearly perceived. An e arlier book, published in 1962 in German, was entitled \"Das Gese tz der Wiederholung'' or \"The Laws of Repetition.\" Although those experiments were rudimentary in comparison to what is contained in Cymatics, Volumes I and II, h is inner eye was already looking far ahead with daring and inspi ration. Jenny liked to quote an aphorism of Heraclitus, \"'A ll is flow. All is in flux.\" More than a favorite m axim, this was a very apt and pointed characterization of the man hi mself. The outer form of things, their skin or surf ace appearance, proved no boundary for his insightful mind and pene trating gaze. Much like the Cymatics experiments brought to light underlying principles of nature, Jenny's indefatig able spirit of inquiry, and unparalleled powers of perception reve aled his ardent desire to know, to understand, to f eel and be at one with the very essence of life, a force which he felt deeply within. It was a tremendous privilege to work side by side with Dr. Jenny for those many years, and I only hop e that this brief synopsis will convey some semblance of the ch aracter of this most remarkable man who was Hans Je nny. *A deluxe edition compiling 275 full-color reproduc tions is entitled Tierlandschaften, or \"Animal Land scapes.\" See color insert at the back of this book. 15"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CYMATICS Volume I The structure and dynamics of waves and vibrations"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"1 Problems of Cymatics Whenever we look in Nature, animate or inanimate, w e see widespread evidence of periodic systems. These systems show a continuously repeated change from one set of conditions to another, oppos ite set. This repetition of polar phases occurs alike in systematized and patte rned elements and in processes and series of events. A few physiological examples may be men- tioned in brief. The great systems of circulation a nd respiration are virtually controlled by such natural periods or rhythms. Insp iration and expiration of the lungs, systole and diastole of the heart are on ly these basic rhythmic processes writ large. In the nervous system the imp ulses occur serially and may therefore be described as frequencies. Much the same applies to the active muscle system which is actually in a state o f constant vibration. The more closely one examines these functions, the more evident do these recur- rent sequences become. Events then, do not take pla ce in a continuous sequence, in a straight line, but are in a continua l state of constant vibra- tion, oscillation, undulation and pulsation. This a lso holds true for system- atized structures. On the largest and smallest scal e, we find serial elements, repetitive patterns — and the number of fiber strom ata, space lattices, and reticulations is legion. If we turn our eyes to the great natural domains, period- icity expands to include the ocean itself. The whol e vegetable kingdom, for instance, is a gigantic example of recurrent elemen ts, an endless formation of tissues on a macroscopic, microscopic and election microscopic scale. Indeed, there is something of a periodic nature in the very concept of a tissue. Again, periodic rhythms are a dominant feature of the anim al kingdom. The metamer- ism of the various phyla is a case in point. It is the operation of this law that gives many worms, arthropods and vertebrates their special characteristics. 17"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"From one specific point in the development of the g erm onwards, the prin- ciple of organization is repeated on a grand scale in the segments. Every system is affected: skeletal, muscular, nervous, va scular, renal system, etc. But this principle is most clearly seen in the cell ular character of organisms. Organs are not homogeneous masses, but tissues of t he utmost delicacy which go on developing and repeating themselves ind efinitely. Linked up with this is the sequence of generations, invariably a r egular sequence of alternat- ing polar-like phases. Even conditions inside the c ell — the processes of cell division and the mechanics of the gene systems — ar e subject to this prin- ciple of oscillation. However natural these things may seem, they are. in fact, not. It must be realized that this periodicity repr esents an aspect of the world, and at first its mysteriousness always inspires a f eeling of the greatest aston- ishment. In organisms, of course, we then find pure oscillatory phenomena rising to a higher plane in the formation of sound; and language itself appears on a still higher plane within this same field. If an inventory were to be drawn up of periodic phenomena in the realm of the organi c, it would have to include the whole scope of morphology and physiology, biolo gy and histology. But we must not forget the inorganic world. In this field we shall merely mention some typical examples recalling known facts, with partic ular reference to physics. Here we encounter vibrations in a pure form, more s pecifically in waves. In the vast spectrum extending from gamma radiation, t hrough the ultraviolet and visible light to infrared (heat rays), to elect ric waves (microwaves and radio waves), we have a field which may be termed p eriodic in the purest sense of the word. Then there are waves in the vari ous states of matter, acoustic vibrations, ultrasound and hypersonics. Ag ain, the lattice structures of matter in the crystalline state are also periodi c. Periodic structure is a salient principle in say. the space lattices of mineralogy. What insights into vibration and periodicity have been gained in the vast range extending from the cosmic systems (rotations, pulsations, turbulences, circul ations, plasma oscillations, periodicity of many kinds in both constituent eleme nts and the whole) down to the world of atomic or even nuclear physics (she ll model of nucleus; nucleon structure: organization of meson clouds)! Here agai n, the idea of periodicity is all-embracing. The few examples we have given he re will serve as sign- posts. But to reveal the systematic, universal char acter of periodic phe- nomenology a great deal would, of course, have to b e added: structural chem- istry, colloidal chemistry, phenomena of mechanical tension such as appear in the isochromatic and isoclinic fringes of photoe lasticity, and all the families of associated trajectories, to name only a few exam ples. Also of interest here is the problem of matter waves (L. de Broglie). Dif fraction patterns have in fact been produced by material particles (atoms and molecules) in experi- ments. Thus these particles also display a wave-lik e behavior This law of 18"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"periodicity is particularly evident in the fault sy stems of geographical forma- tions, which affect immense areas of rock. Solar physics is another field in which oscillatory and wave processes are prominent. Our mental picture of the sun can accomm odate serial structures, actual acoustic waves, plasma oscillations, turbule nces, tendencies to recur- rence of many kinds, periodic dynamics, etc. Moreov er, many of the systems we have mentioned are polyperiodic in character. Th e rhythms and vibrations interpenetrate. But in every case periodicity is co nstitutive of their nature; without periodicity they would not exist at all. Each of the fields we have mentioned would of cours e require a mono- graph of its own if it were to be properly describe d from the point of view of periodicity. The brief examples given here, in whic h reference is made to known facts, are only intended to give some idea of the inventory which, as suggested above, might be drawn upon the basis of p eriodicity. Hence it might be said without hesitation that the systems availab le to our experience are essentially periodic and that phenomena appear to b e periodic throughout. However different the objects concerned, however di fferent their causes and functional mechanisms, they have in common rhythmic ity, oscillation and seri- ality. Nonetheless it must be realized that this co nclusion does not take us to the real heart of these rhythms and wave processes. Indeed, it is only the discovery of the ubiquitous character of waves in t he world that confronts us with the precise question: How actually do these vi brations function in a par- ticular environment. a particular medium, a particu lar material? Even if we know whether we are dealing with hormonal influences, ne ural impulses, or mechanical or chemical factors, the actual problem still remai ns: What is really happening in all these periodic phenomena? What actually take s place in the periodic field? Now in view of the extreme variety of things affected, the extreme vari- ety of systems coming into consideration, we have t o seek out the rhythmic or serial where it is most characteristic, study it ca refully, and observe its intrin- sic character. Considering, then, that the repetiti ve alternation of opposed phases is common to ail these phenomena, can we in this way obtain a de- scription of periodicity which will reveal a basic phenomenon and afford a clear picture of its most fundamental nature? One e xample, which stands for many, will bring the problems involved into sharper focus. Let us consider the striated muscle in action. When the skeletal muscle is fully contracted, it displays what is known as tetantzation. It is then seemingly in a state of continuous contraction. Closer examination and meas urement, however, reveal an entirely different picture. It has been s hown that in tetanization there are in the muscle, oscillations which can be demonstrated mechani- cally, optically and acoustically; they correspond to the frequencies of the impulses transmitted to the muscle. The \"muscle sou nd\" audible when the 19"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"muscle is contracted is due, therefore, to the rhyt hm or frequency of the \"minia- ture contractions at maximum tetanus\" (Reichel 1960 ). Whatever happens, then, in the active muscle takes place in these rhythms. Let us consider exactly what this means. The numerous and vastly complex process es in the active muscle are all subsumed in this periodicity. It is in this vibratory field that all the bioelec- tric, chemical, mechanical, energetic, thermal, str uctural, kinetic and dynamic processes take their course. What are the effects o f this oscillatory process in all these sectors? What are the kinetic effects of vibration on liquid systems? How do chemical reactions take place when they are enacted in media whose processes are without exception periodic in charact er? These are questions which follow directly upon actual observation. As w e said above, the example of muscles in action must stand for many others How ever this organic sys- tem involves structures of the greatest intricacy; their very complexity forbids simple discussion. And yet they are a clear invitat ion to explore their peculiar nature, their dynamics and kinetics, their structur e and texture as revealed in their periodicity. It is these problems which are t he focus of our research. What we are concerned to do then, is not to formula te hypotheses about backgrounds and final causes, but rather to press o n step by step with our exploration into this field and to find methods of giving tangible expression to this phenomenology Observation must begin, however, with relatively si mple processes; many variations must be made in experimental conditions; and the object itself must be allowed to point the way from one set of experim ents to another. It must be stressed that it is not a question of demonstrating the periodic and the rhythmic as such, or eliciting it from the complexities of i ts worid according to the criteria of wave theory. The contrary is the case. It must b e detected in its own world, its own environment, so that its specific effects a re discovered and its multi- farious operations recognized. Only by \"getting ins ide\" the phenomena through empirical and systematic research can we gradually elicit systems in such a way that mental constructs can be created which wil l throw a light on the ulti- mate realities. For it must be stated quite categor ically that we have to proceed on strictly empirical and phenomenological lines an d that all interpretative or analogical thinking will be out of place. If a name is required for this field of research it might be called cymatics (to kyma, the wave; ta kymatika, matters pertaining to waves, wave matters). This underlines that we are not dealing with vibratory phenomena in the narrow sense, but r ather with the effects of vibrations. Our documentation is primarily concerne d with the experimental demonstration of phenomena in the acoustic and lowe r ultrasonic range. Examples will also be interposed showing periodic p henomena occurring without an actual vibratory field in order to affor d a view of the general field of periodicity or, in other words, of cymatics in t he broader sense. 20"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2 Experimental Method In attempting to observe the phenomena of vibration , one repeatedly feels a spontaneous urge to make the processes visible an d to provide ocular evi- dence of their nature.

Who can repr oduce a symphony after only one hearing, or even recall all its themes? Bu t how many are there who, after looking at a picture, can in principle descri be its main elements. It is not surprising then, that workers in experimental acous tics should have striven to make its phenomena visible during important periods of the development of the science. Special mention might be made of E. F. P. Chladni (1756-1827) who discovered the sonorous figures named after him while he was investi- gating Lichtenberg figures. With a violin bow he st roked metal plates sprinkled with powder and was thus able to make the vibration processes visible. The vibratory movement caused the powder to move from t he antinodes to the nodal lines, and Chladni was thus enabled to lay do wn the experimental prin- ciples of acoustics (e.g. die Akustik, 1802). Work on this basis was not easy and, more particularly, the conditions of the exper iment did not allow a suffi- cient range of observation since they could not be freely varied while the experiment was in progress. Thus the first necessit y was to elaborate meth- ods enabling the conditions of the experiment to be accurately fixed while still allowing free variation within these limits. One su ch method, which utilizes the piezoelectric effect, deserves special mention. Many crystals are distorted 21"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"by electric impulses, and conversely they produce electric potentials when they are distorted. If a series of elec- tric impulses is applied to the crystal lattice, the resulting distortions have the character of real vibrations. We will not go further here, into the complexi- ties of vibrating crystal space lattices. Suffice it to say that these vibrating crystals afford a whole range of experi- mental possibilities. First of all, the number of impulses can be precisely determined with the generator exciting them. Thus we can always know the frequency (number of vibrations per second) and also the strength of the impulse (excursion or amplitude of the vibrating body). Moreover the pre- cise site of stimulation can be known in every case. Most important of all, however, is the fact that the experi- ment is not limited in time. The fre- quency and the amplitude can both be altered during the experiment. Hence it is possible not only to pro- duce vibration patterns and investi- gate the laws to which they continu- ously conform, but also, and more especially, to make a close study of the transitions as one figure gives way to another. The experiment can be discontinued at any stage and each phase observed.

The oscillator is fixed to the underside. Fig. 1 shows the situation before the exciting impulse. In Fig. 2 the impulse has started and gradually the vibrational patterns of the plate are rendered visible. In Fig. 6 the sonorous figure has formed. It must be realized tha t in Figs. 2-6 the whole process is also audible. The exciting note can be h eard continuously through- out the various stages (frequency 7560 cps). It wou ld be really true to say that one can hear what one sees and see what one hears. Some experiments will now be described in order to show what this method is capable of achieving. It is of course possible to attach more than one cr ystal oscillator to the same body and observe the effect. Fig. 7 shows a so norous figure (frequency 800 cps) and Fig. 11 a second figure (frequency 865 cps). Each is individually excited. In Fig. 9, however, they are simultaneousl y excited, i.e. both notes can be heard. The figure shows the resultants of th e two vibrations. From here it is only a step to making beats (interferenc es) visible. They have al- ready been demonstrated by using a plate with irreg ularities in its material (Zenneck). If the characteristic tones of this mate rial were proportional to the beat, the loops could be seen to change regularly i n diameter. By using crys- tal oscillators a great variety of interference con ditions can be selected. If two notes are produced with frequencies giving rise to beats, the whole Chladni figure pulsates or moves to-and-fro. Again, the pha ses can be changed in the course of the experiment. The stages arising between the actual sonorous figu res are of particular interest- Currents appear. The sand is moved around as if it were fluid. Nev- ertheless the organization of the vibrational field s persists in as much as these currents of sand move in the same or opposite direc tions. Fig. 12 shows such a process; the arrows indicate the direction in whi ch the current is moving. Fig. 24 also shows this experiment and it is seen i n greater detail in Fig. 25. Naturally the sand simply serves as an indicator. T he actual events in vibrat- ing plates and diaphragms are of extraordinary comp lexity In the fields, for instance, areas appear which the indicator reveals to be in rotation. The pow- der congregates in small circular areas which conti nue to rotate regularly as long as the note is sounded. This rotational effect is not merely adventitious, but appears systematically throughout the vibration al field. Fig. 13 shows a plate with a number of rotating areas in which the direction of rotation of each area is contrary to that of its neighbors. The arro ws show the direction of rota- tion. The circulation continues steadily and its co urse can be followed by mark- ing with colored grains. Phases can also be demonst rated in which both cur- rents and rotation are present The following phenom enon is then observed: a small round heap which must be imagined to rotate h as sand flowing towards it 24"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"12 The arrows indicate the direction of flow of the streams of particles.

Fig. 26 shows this happening. We thus have circular heaps which are joined together by bridges of flowing sand, or put another way, each circu- lar heap has two flowing arms which move towards it, turn, and flow into it. These rotary effects can also be seen in \"quite ordinary\" Chladni figures. They point the way to still further in- vestigations into the real vibratory pro- cesses in these bodies. At the same time they are a reminder that we should watch for such processes in vibrational fields. Indeed these cur- rents, centers of rotation, revolving heaps with influent streams and con- necting flows must actually be ex- pected, and the material occupying the field will indicate the vibrational pattern prevailing there. There can be no doubt about the occurrence of these formations. It is obvious that all these processes (interference, flows, rotation) could be more appropriately documented by cin- ematography; photographs can only stimulate the mind into grasping these processes imaginatively.* 14 A steel plate deliberately cut in an irregular shape.

Fig. 14 rep- resents a sonorous figure on a steel plate of arbitrary shape. The condi- tions revealed on the variously formed lobes can be studied. Fig. 15 also reproduces a complicated fig- ure. It is precisely in figures of this kind that symmetrical relationships between the various parts can be found. It might be mentioned in pass- ing that in such structures as these both planar and axial symmetry enter as factors. In Fig. 16 we see a guitar energized by sound (520 cps). The indicator substance reveals the real wave events in the wooden body. If the material contains irregularities, say cracks in the wood, there are cor- responding changes in the pattern of oscillation. Vibrational behavior in forms whose modes of vibration can- not be calculated can also be rendered visible in this way. In Fig. 17, a brass plate has been made to vibrate by sound and its pattern of vibration can be clearly discerned. An interesting observation may be made at this point. The masses affected by a tone are, of course, naturally forced into the form corre- sponding to the vibrational effect. While the tone impulse persists, liq- uids and viscous masses will remain in their place if the diaphragm is tilted. or even held vertically. If the vibration 27 "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"is discontinued, the masses slip down under the force of gravity. If the resumption of the tone is not delayed too long, the masses return to their position, i.e. they climb up again. In a sense it would be legitimate to speak of an antigravitation effect. In Fig. 18 the vibrating diaphragm is arranged obliquely; the mass will not slip down so long as the tone is present. Even the ringing of a bell can be rendered visible. Fig. 19 shows the vibrational pattern that appears. In order to take investigations into the vibration of complicated bodies a step further a photoelastic technique was developed. The stroboscope, which is an instrument for rendering visible the phases of rapid periodic motion, is used as the source of light. The stroboscopic light is polarized and penetrates the transparent model which is made to vibrate. The analyzer enables the vibrational process to be observed as a photoelastic phenom- enon. This technique makes feasible the study of even such complicated forms as musical instruments (e.g. the violin) in a state of vibration, at feast within the limitations imposed by the use of a model. If a liquid is used as an indicator instead of sand, an entirely different picture is obtained. The nodal lines disappear and the antinodes appear as wave fields. Fig. 20 is a sonorous figure. In Fig. 21 we have the same plate, excited at the same frequency, but covered by a sheet of liquid. The same pattern can be recognized in both pictures.

In Fig, 21 the fields of movement are rendered visible by the wave lattices; there is nothing to be seen where the nodal lines are. The most varied forms of wave trains are to be seen in lattice areas. The move- ments at the margins of the fields are striking. If lycopodium powder (spores of the club moss) are strewn on the surface, violent movements can sometimes be seen. A turbulent zone consisting of unstable wave phenom- ena often forms there. Thus in the one case (Fig. 21) the moving elements are shown; in the other (Fig. 20) those parts which exhibit no movement are shown. Thus the actuating is, as it were, opposed to the actuated, the creating to the created. This draws attention to the fact that the patterns taking shape must be understood in terms of their environment, that pat- terns in general are, as it were, an expression of the movement and en- ergizing process. One might speak of a creans/creatum relationship. Thus there are many conditions under which the mind might be said to be directed to the environment, to the circumambient space, to the field from which space lattices, networks, etc. take their rise in the first place. In other words: observation of organized pat- terns and the milieu creating them raises questions as to the processes incidental and precedent to the forma- tion of such patterns. This nexus of problems is one that merits further investigation, e.g. in mineralogy col- loid chemistry, in periodic or rhythmic 29"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"precipitations, and in the field of chemical reactions in general. What happens before fibers, fibrils and crys- tals are separated out? Since such systems are shown to be periodically textured or patterned, periodic pro- cesses of a corresponding kind must be present in the preceding stages. But they always have to be verified in the concrete case. Vibrating materials naturally react quite unequivocally to heat conditions. Not only the crystal oscillators, but also the plates and diaphragms change their vibrational characteris- tics to a remarkable degree. They might truthfully be described as sen- sitive. The following experiment is representative of many. Fig. 22 is pro- duced by a tone with a frequency of 1580 cps. If the outermost edge of the steel plate is heated for a few seconds by a flame, the whole vibrational pat- tern changes at once, as is shown in Fig. 23. If the tone is continued during cooling, the original sonorous figure returns after a few moments (Fig. 22). Not only the effects of the vibration, but also the vibrating media themselves have highly specific characteristics. 22 Sonorous figure.

What we actually witness here is the effect of vibration. T he effects produced by vibra- tion in this or that material, in this or that medi um — that is what is to be dem- onstrated. We are in fact present at the very site where the oscillating process takes its effect. First we shall simply pass under review a series of such phe- nomena. The classes of phenomena appearing, and the relationships existing between them will be revealed little by little by t he things themselves. First we see some sonorous figures (Figs. 36-42). A ll these experiments were performed with crystal oscillators. This type of experiment enables the vibrational patterns to be produced in series and c ompared. It is notable in these serial experiments that the same formal patte rn recurs at increasing frequencies, but that the number of constituent ele ments also increases at the higher frequencies. It is apparent from the ser ies Figs. 36-42 that the figures at the higher frequencies display many more elements. In Figs. 27-30 we see a formal pattern of which sim ilar versions are repeated as the frequency increases. In Figs. 27-30 the frequencies are 1690, 2500, 4820, and 7800 cps, respectively. Here again use was made of a steel plate (23x23 cm and 1 mm thick). The size of the plates can, of course, be varied at will. We have used plates ranging from th e size of the ear drum (approx. 7x9 mm) to 70x70 cm. Also the material of the plate can be selected as desired (glass, copper, wood, steel, cardboard, earthenware , etc.). Apart from the rule that the number of elements increases with the freq uency, a variety of other observations may be made of the sonorous figures (F igs. 36-42). Since the process can be stopped at any stage, the formation of nodal lines can be fol- lowed step by step. The observer can see how the pa rticles are transported 35"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"and how two lines draw together In the marginal zones turbulent areas can be seen in which the particles form vorti- ces. One point is particularly notewor- thy. In the series of vibrations one meta- morphosis is quite literally followed by another. The variety of resultants and products of co-acting forces is inex- haustible. Continuous variations are to be found on the basic concentric/radial pattern in round plates and the paral- lel/diagonal pattern in rectangular plates. But there is an additional factor to consider. One formal element is re- peated in one and the same sonorous figure. We are therefore actually deal- ing with the same configuration. Now, no plate is completely uniform through- out, and as a result the energy imparted to it by the frequency is not evenly dis- tnbuted. The consequence of this is that the pattern is imperfectly formed in some places and fails to appear com- pletely; but more important still is the fact that the elements of form vary in the sense that they become, as it were, variants of a form (see e.g. Fig. 38). At one moment a pattern is closed and separate; at another the same element is open and linked up with its environ- ment. Again, patterns become united which, elsewhere on the same plate during the same experiment, are disjoined. Simply by reference to these principles of resultant systems, meta- morphosis and variability, an atlas of sonorous figures could be compiled. But amidst all these figurate patterns the kinetic factor keeps on appearing, particularly in the \"continuous waves\" we have already mentioned and the 31-34 A liquid is made to vibrate on a dia- phragm with a diameter of 28 crn; the modes of vibration give rise to a multiplicity of pat- terns and textures.

There are no transverse waves. rotational effects. In such cases the whole figure is in a state of flow or com- prises a number of rotational centers with adjacent centers invariably revolving in opposite directions. Figs. 13 and 24 must theref ore be conceived not as figures, but in kinetic terms. Fig. 25 is a detail from a flow phase. Thus when figure, configuration, form, pattern and texture, etc. are referred to in this connection, we are using empirical descr iptions. The woof and weft of these phenomena is so continually shifting that the y cannot be pinned down to any rigid definitions. It will be apparent in the c ourse of our disquisition that these various categories of phenomena interlink and interpenetrate to such an extent that definitions would inevitably dismember something which represents a closely knit unity throughout. This applies in pa rticular to the effects of vibra- tion in liquids. Under the action of oscillations a t frequencies as high as the lower ultra-sonic range, it will be noted that the surface of liquids crinkles to form a wave field. This effect can be traced in det ail if the reflected image of a cross or lattice of threads on the surface of the l iquid is observed. In the re- flected light it appears to be distorted. The exten t of the distortion corresponds to the exciting frequency. Figurate patterns, howev er also appear in liquids. Fig.44 shows such an oscillation pattern in glyceri n; likewise Fig. 45. We must realize that in these and the following photographs a great diversity of things must be observed at the same time. Configurations ( standing waves) can be recorded, but at the same time there are currents w hich impart flow to the patterns. Eddying regions point to turbulences. Now and again an interference oscillation flits across the field, etc. When vario us areas of oscillation move towards each other, there is a tendency for Lissajo us figures to form with more or less clarity. Figs. 31-34 and 46-49 show a transition from figure s to organized arrays. Hexagonal, rectangular and imbricate patterns strik e the eye as honeycombs, networks and lattices. Occasionally a picture forms but then the textures shift and change into every imaginable display. Figs. 46- 49 and 31-34 may be taken as examples. Once again there are reminiscenc es of Lissajous figures (e.g. Fig. 49). It is hardly necessary to add that interference phe nomena can once again be demonstrated in these experiments with liq uids. A pulsing move- ment may be imparted to the whole sheet of liquid w hile the wave lattices, depending on the phase conditions, may, for example , appear and vanish with lightning rapidity. Mention should be made at this point of an unusual experiment. The curva- ture of the surface already referred to, causes the mass of the liquid to shift. This brings about a change in the oscillatory chara cter of the whole system. The procedure is as follows. A film of water some 3 cm in diameter is energized by a frequency of approximately 2400 cps. Adelicate wavelike pattern is formed. 37"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 A sonorous figure produced by piezoelectric excitation. The triangle measures 24 cm along each edge. Steel plate.

In such experiments as these, the formation of nodal lines of sand can be accurately observed. They often pile up like dunes. But at the same time a pulsing move- ment is set up which affects the whole. The curvature of the surfaces and the ensuing changes in mass and position cause the liquid to slip away from the frequency impinging upon it. The fac- tor causing the curvature is thus re- moved. The mass now returns to the initial position and once again comes under the influences of the energizing tone. The process is repeated and this pulsation becomes regular. In the ex- periment described, the rate of pulsa- tion was 80 per minute. This phenom- enon exemplifies a pulsating system. As we proceed with our series of experiments with liquids, we obtain or- ganized patterns of ever increasing delicacy. The impression created is one of textures. Figs. 50-53 show what happens. The pictures look like closely interwoven fabrics. Appropriate changes in the strength of the vibra- tion (amplitude modulation) can be used to show how these wave \"fab- rics\" are woven out of wave trains. By adjusting the movement of a vibrating diaphragm it is possible to produce only one train of waves. The wave may be of the standing or traveling variety (Fig. 35). Further undulations can be generated by changing the amplitude, whereupon a grid-like pattern appears. In Fig. 54 this process can be seen in the nascent state. Some of the large waves are beginning to undulate in themselves. Signs of incipient trans- verse elements can be seen more particularly in the central parts of the photograph. Whereas these figures, whether 39 "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"standing or traveling, have a certain constancy of appearance as organized patterns and textures, there are also phenomena in a constant process of change. Figs. 55-58 are turbulences generated by vibration, showing this type of dynamic formation. These for- mations, which are constantfy coming and going, appear in a marginal zone, where a vibrational process meets a zone of inactivity. They are thus entirely different from the turbulent processes appearing in flow phenomena. Nor should they be confused with vortices (to which we shall be proceeding in a moment) which are hydrodynamic phe- nomena produced by vibration. These \"wave curls\" must be conceived as being in motion, but in an unstable state. They disappear but appear again in a similar configuration; thus they are irregularly regular or regularly irregu- lar. They are also in evidence along the borders of the wave fields noted in the sonorous figures produced in liq- uids. They show up particularly well in fluorescent liquids. In ultraviolet light, for instance, they figure as \"light sources\" in contrast to the non-fluores- ceni areas. This curious phenomenon with its vortices and waves which tend to vanish and then return, is thus ren- dered wholly visible. Pictures such as Figs. 57-58 may look so similar that they might be thought to be photo- graphs of the same situation but with some variations. It may happen that the waves disappear between the photographs and then reappear. In 1928 G. von Bekesy discov- ered in experiments with models of 38 Sonorous figure. Plate 25 x 33 cm.

He found that as the fre- quency increased, the two eddies moved towards the stapes in precise conformity with the laws of hydrody- namics. The direction in which the eddy rotates is constant; the speed of rota- tion increases with the strength of the vibration; the location, as explained, is determined by the frequency. These therefore are hydrodynamic phenom- ena caused by vibration. In the experiments described here, vortices are also produced by tones although in an entirely different way. The simplest case is shown in Fig. 59. This is a film of liquid a few centime- ters in diameter. To make the pattern of currents visible, a black dye was used as an indicator. It will be seen that a pair of eddies is formed symmetri- cally. Here again the speed of rotation is proportional to the amplitude. Fig. 60 shows the process by which the ed- dies are generated. This experiment, however, is performed with a sheet of liquid about 23 cm across which is made to vibrate by a tone (frequency 100 cps). Trains of waves correspond- ing to this tone can be seen in various parts of the photograph. The black dye which originally covered the whole sheet begins to form eddies; in other places it is still unbroken. What we see in this photograph is really the nascent 40 A sonorous figure on an ellipsoid steel plate. Greatest diameter 31 cm, 3095 cps. Excita- tion by crystal oscillators.

In such cases there is always a strict bilateral symmetry. On the face of it, this is astonishing. This eddy f ormation, however, is found to be directly connected with the vibrational pattern and its organization. Indi- vidual wave trains can also be discerned in this vi brational pattern. Additional pairs of eddies are formed at the sides, and these again are strictly symmetri- cal. In the marginal regions rotary currents with a tendency to form vortices can be seen everywhere. In passing, it is interesting t o note the numerous turbulent areas which form in the marginal zones. Figs. 62 an d 63 give details of this phenomenology of eddy formation. Fig. 62 affords a picture of the very center of this symmetrical pattern. The precision of the f low is clearly visible; the axis of symmetry runs from the top to the bottom, and th e dividing line between the quadrants runs from left to right. Below right the eddy turns in a clockwise direction, and below left in a counterclockwise dir ection. It is particularly inter- esting to see in Figs. 62 and 63 how the currents m ove in layers. The dye indicator is distributed in laminar fashion. Fig. 6 4 shows once again a vortex in the form of four quadrants; once more there is symm etry and laminar flow. In all these pictures it must be imagined that the liquid is flowing quietly in a vortex while the energizing sound can be heard. If the exp eriment is performed with an opaque liquid, say mercury, some lycopodiurn can be strewn over it in order to make the currents visible. These experiments have similarly revealed that not only are proper vorti- ces formed, but also curious rotational currents su ch as may be seen in Fig. 65. The first beginnings of vortices can be discerned i n the upper and lower section of the energized liquid. In the center there are in dications of a figure-eight form, whose periphery is formed by the black fluid made t o flow by the energizing sound. There is, of course, no division in the form of a lemniscate; here again the rotational flow is steady. This particular field of cymatic studies calls for further extensive research. How do currents flow in three-dimensional space? Cu rrents and countercur- rents must be demonstrated, and above all, the oper ation of these hydrody- namic phenomena must be studied at the minutest sca le, as we have already seen in the hydrodynamic theory of hearing. If we allow these examples of cymatic phenomenology to file past our inner eye, we are struck by the extraordinary richness an d diversity of the forms and processes. Yet even at this siage, certain signific ant features stand out from the background pattern. Figures, organized patterns and textures appear, real wave processes arise, then the whole is set in motion and fluctuates, giving rise to eddies, flows and streams. However, still further categories of phenomena will become apparent to us; and we shall then see whether we can gradually educe the outlines of basic phenomena 43"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"41 44 41 A sonorous figure excited on a circular steel pl ate.

For this purpose the tonoscope was developed. This is a simple apparatus into whic h the experimentor can speak with out any intermediate electroacoustic uni t. Thus vibrations are im- parted to a diaphragm on which sand, powder, or a l iquid are placed as indica- tors. Speaking actually produces on this diaphragm figures which correspond, as it were, to the sound spectrum of a vowel. Figs. 67.68 and 69 are photo- graphs of these vowel figures. The pattern is chara cteristic not only of the sound but also the pitch of the speech or song. The indic ator material and also the nature of the diaphragm are, of course, also determ inative factors. However, given the same conditions for the experiment, the f igure is a specific one. One can sing a melody and not only hear it, but also se e it. As the photographs show, organized patterns and configurations are qui te apparent. They are there for the eye. man's most sensitive organ of sense, t o see. A pattern appears to take shape before the eye and, as long as the sound is spoken, to behave like something alive. The breath alone can cause it to m ove; a texture of forms is created by the fluctuations of the voice. The eye c an also see variations as the voice is raised or lowered. During continuous speec h the patterns metamor- phose continually. The purpose of these observation s was to show that such figures and patterns can give rise to a visual expe rience which can be fully equated to the aural experience. This is an achieve ment which not only opens up a new world to those with normal hearing, who se e for themselves that their speech actually involves the production of vibratin g patterns which continually penetrate and fill space, but also, and most import ant of all. it enables the deaf to experience what they are actually producing with the speech they have learned 63"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"and been trained to use. They do not hear the sound they create although they no doubt see the speech movements of others. But th ey have no sensory ex- perience which is equivalent to hearing a tone, a v owel, a word. A truly figurate pattern, however, speaks a language of its own; a p icture is a perceptual expe- rience complete in its own terms. Experience has sh own that these tonoscope pictures are highly stimulating to the mind of the deaf-and-dumb. If a deaf-and- dumb patient, for instance, speaks an 'O', the soun d element contained in the speech of the deaf-and-dumb subject also appears in the vibrational pattern. Now he can see the 'O' which a normal person speaks . The difference between the two pictures is very marked, but he is now give n an opportunity of practicing until he has achieved the form of a purer 'O' sound . Everything he does be- comes visually apparent to him. As soon as he can p roduce the form of a purer 'O', we can hear that he is also speaking a purer ' O'- The same holds true for pitch. Here again he is enabled to practice until h e can achieve nuances of speech which he is unable to experience through the sense of hearing. He is now open to visual experiences which can be equated with the stream of speech, the pulsing of the air mass, the air stream, etc. H e can see the to-and-fro motion of his sounds, his words and sentences, and also the flow patterns made by good speech. Since deaf-and-dumb patients h ave very sensitive vision (and a very fine sense of touch) they can fa miliarize themselves with the visual speech of the tonoscope and train with i ts aid. An electroacoustic variant of the tonoscope is suit able for visualizing not only speech but also music. The sonorous patterns a re directly impressed on, say, a liquid, and not only the rhythm and volume b ecome visible but also the figures which correspond to the frequency spectra e xciting them. These so- norous patterns are extraordinarily complex in the case of orchestral sound. Figs. 70-73 show the visual versions of musical exc erpts: 70 Bach, 71 Bach. 72 Mozart, 73 Mozart. If we look at these passages on a silent film, we c an at first make nothing of them. If, for example, we see the Jupiter Symphony without being able to hear the music, we should never guess from the visual ef fects with their flowing and constantly changing patterns, that we were seeing M ozart. The rests in particu- lar, which are inscrutably and essentially part of the music, appear at first to the beholder as black holes, as a cessation of activity . But if the sound is turned on, everything flashes to significance for the eye. Hea ring is added and restores to experience its full content. It takes training to b e able to \"hear by seeing\". The tonoscope is a device with which one can train ones eif in this art.

The lycopodium powder is strewn evenly on a diaphra gm (Fig. 74). The diaphragm is excited by a tone. Immediately a numbe r of small round shapes are formed (Fig. 82}. If the amplitude is increased , these shapes begin to migrate to the places where the oscillatory movemen t is more pronounced (Fig. 83). As this happens, many of them unite to f orm new piles of spherules. If this process is continued, more and more of thes e formations join up. One large overall form might appear. Fig. 83 shows the migrating piles of spherules and the paths they follow. All these round piles ar e in a state of constant circulation; that is, the particles on the upper su rface move from the center towards the periphery and those at the bottom in th e contrary direction. They rise upwards at the center and then proceed towards the periphery, etc. There is thus a kind of radial circulation.

The same circulation a lso takes place in the large forms; however, these processes can be seen taking place in the areas where organized patterns have been formed by the vibratio n. Fig. 84 shows a large complex of this kind. We can see the patterns whose configuration changes with shifts of frequency. Fig. 84 is formed by a so ft tone. Fig.85 shows a large circular shape about the size of a small chicken's egg at a frequency of 300 cps. If the amplitude is further increased correspo nding to a crescendo for the ear, the movements become increasingly violent. The circulation becomes faster and proceeds on a larger scale. Eventually m asses are thrown up and ejected. There are eruptions and fountains of powde r which swirl high into the air {Fig. 75). A vortical movement can be seen in o ne of these powder fountains (Fig. 76). But while masses are ejected at one mome nt, they fall and are re- turned to the system at another. Thus, for all the changes and transpositions, a certain constancy of mass is curiously retained. Th e forms move to-and-fro both when the frequency is changed and the amplitud e. In doing so they move as wholes, i.e. when they move in one direction by putting out an arm, the whole follows, and there is retraction at another p lace. Thus locomotion is truly correlated throughout. Instead of parcelation, ther e is a uniform streaming 71"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"or flowing. This character is, of course, determined simply and solely by the vibrational pattern. Once the tone is discontinued, the powder lies undisturbed as an accumulation of particles. Even the separation and re- pining of the formations take place in this uniform manner. Whether they engulf each other or disjoin from each other, there are no indications any- where of a disintegration or disrup- tion. It can sometimes be observed by stroboscope that the conglomera- tions are pulsating. If the amplitude is greatly increased (fortissimo), the powder changes into a cloud of dust. The phenomenon en- ters the spatial or three-dimensional Even so, the stroboscope still reveals in these turbulent, eddying masses certain arrangements which can be traced back to the vibrational pattern (Fig. 77). Where the turbulence is most marked, vacant zones, spatial eddies, \"empty spaces\" alternate in conformity with the patterns imposed by the vibration. If at the greatest amplitude when the powder is thrown up into a veritable cloud storm, the sound is switched off abruptly, the powder falls back onto the motionless diaphragm more or less evenly. At this maximum modulation of amplitude, then, what might be described as an integrating effect is possible. The con- figuration of particles, for all its multi- formity and individualization, can be integrated in an instant, and we are back at the initial position.

When vibration is switched o n, the grains of sand move into the nodal lines and the lycopodium spores into the antinodes, in the center of which they join together and start to circulate. In Fig. 78 (steel plate, frequency 3600 cps) the quartz sand is in th e nodal lines and the cen- tral white spots are lycopodium. The round circulat ing heaps are not to be found with lycopodium alone. If quartz sand is pour ed into a vibrating sheet of water, round heaps of circulating sand can be disce rned in the wave fields of the liquid i.e in the areas of motion. Fig. 79 clea rly demonstrates this. Needless to say, the processes of interference refe rred to above can also be generated with lycopodium powder. The forms then move to-and-fro be- tween two positions, or phases of rest alternate wi th phases of movement. Since a vibrational system contains certain heterog eneous elements within itself it is possible for interference phenomena to be generated by one tone and shown by the indicating material. Rotational effects can also be seen here. In the ci rcular heap, the move- ment created follows a circular path. If this proce ss takes place in two direc- tions, a seesaw effect results. The phenomenon occu rs like this: a stream of powder follows a circular path through the round fo rm, moving forward in what looks like minor eruptions; there is a period of re st, and then the same move- ment starts again, but in the opposite direction; a nother period of rest; and then the first movement is repeated, and so on. This see saw effect has, of course, been filmed (as has all the phenomenology shown her e).* It might also be noted that it can be produced with an impulse at on ly one frequency. Thus a system, if it is of such a type as to contain sever al oscillatory responses, can be made to produce interference by one frequency or ev en produce a seesaw effect (i.e. without frequency modulation in the ge nerating tone). This series of experiments is exceptionally diversi fied. Well-known sono- rous figures may appear with lycopodium under certa in conditions.

There are emp ty spaces on the one hand and powder erupting into clouds on the other. It mi ght also be noted that a few isolated round shapes have formed where the vib ration is less violent. Kinetic-dynamic processes can be instigated by freq uency modulation. Here the situation is not static, as in Fig. 81; instead currents race around the empty spaces, partly in opposed directions.

From the very large number of pe- riodic phenomena in which no actual vibration is involved we have singled out three examples and sketched them in their phenomenal form. The first example concerns Liesegang rings or periodic precipita- tions. They were discovered by Raphael Eduard Liesegang (1869- 1947), and they involve processes in the field of chemical reactions. The experiments described in Figs. 93-95 and 102 were performed essentially according to Liesegang's method. A layer of gelatin containing the chro- mium salt potassium bichromate, is poured onto a glass plate: a drop of silver nitrate is then placed on this gela- tin layer. A chemical reaction takes place between the two salts and silver chromate is formed. This precipitated salt however, is not diffused evenly, but periodically or rhythmically; zones of precipitation alternate regularly with zones free from precipitation. In this 85"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"way the concentric rings seen in Fig. 93 are formed.

In Fig. 95 Liesegang pre- cipitations appear again. The inner- most of the zones enclosed by the curved lines, however, displays crys- tallization. Thus the features of the two patterns can be seen side by side and compared. If the experiment is on a larger scale, whale \"precipitation landscapes\" are created as seen in Fig. 102. However the drops of silver nitrate are placed, the same picture of periodic precipitation is obtained everywhere. The curvilinear patterns of peri- odicity are brought about by these precipitations and processes of dif- fusion. In every pool one can see the first beginnings of a rhythmic pattern. The various theories advanced to explain this phenomenon will not be discussed here. Even the many analo- gies drawn with patterns in the ani- mal and vegetable kingdom (as for example the arrangement of pigment on butterfly wings, comparisons with bone lamellae, etc.) cannot be veri- fied. From 1913 to 1935 Liesegang himself probed deeply into the true nature of these reactions. He studied agate, the banding of rock formations, 95 95 Liesegang rings. The salt has crystallized out in the interior areas. Rhythmic precipitations which are not themselves a crystallizing process can be compared with crystalline formations. 94 Liesegang precipitations proceeding ver- tically from lop to bottom.

In these studies he made a clear distinction betwee n internal and external rhythm. He assumed the first to be present only whe n the rhythmicity neces- sarily arose from the system in question. We chose the example of Liesegang rings in order to direct attention to the wide field of periodicity without vibration in chemical reactions. This opens up a whole realm of phenomenology, the basic outlin es of which were already sketched by Liesegang; simple and multiple periodic precipitation, periodic formation of semi-permeable membranes, rhythmic pre cipitation without gela- tin, rhythmic crystallizations, stratification in d rying colloidal layers, rhythmic deposition of precipitates, rhythmic precipitation of vapors. The problems of \"chemical periodicity\" take us far into the fields of biology and physiology. Indeed, it is hardly surprising that these phenomen a bring us to the question of how catalysis functions. Figure 103 portrays another example of a periodic p rocess taking place without vibration. Drops of an emulsion dyed red ar e placed in a weak solu- tion of Indian ink. The diameter of the area of ink is about 30 cm. First of all a delicate film forms over the entire surface. Then t he emulsion slowly diffuses into the fluid according to the concentration gradi ent. The focus of interest here is on this diffusion: it proceeds in a periodi c, rhythmic, to-and-fro man- ner. The flow of the diffusion is serpentine in cha racter. Long winding pro- cesses are sent out and tail off to nothing as they become diluted. If drops are placed in several positions, the pressure of diffus ion causes the circumambient areas to become displaced in relation to each other ; some expand while oth- ers contract. In this way cell-like zones are forme d whose boundaries consist of films of constantly increasing thickness. Since there are no walls or \"banks\" within each individual region and liquid can thus m ove in liquid, the emulsion can diffuse away without impediment, and the proces s of diffusion is as free as can be imagined. This is what happens on the one hand. On the other hand, this spreading does not proceed on a uniform linear front, but accord- ing to a hydrodynamic pattern displaying periodicit y in great variety. If the quantity and the concentration are altered, a whole array of phenomena make their appearance: thick serpentine spurts of fluid; then again, delicate forma- tions vanishing like wisps of mist (Fig. 96); cente rs flowing out radially in all directions; in several places tiny streams crisscro ssing and forming a lattice; and then again hair-like threads of fluid anastomiz ing (Fig. 97). In Fig. 103 a whole series of these processes can be observed. Ho wever, it must be re- membered that all the red structures are in a state of flux, that the cells are shifting to-and-fro, and the liquid system is const antly diffusing away. As we mentioned before, all this takes place without vibr ation in the true sense of 87"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"96, 97 Dispersion at a concentration gradient similarly takes place in an oscillating, periodic manner. A whole hydrodynamic phenomenol- ogy makes its appearance. In figure 96 the concentrated emulsion disperses by. as it were, trailing off on every side into delicate rivulets. In figure 97, on the other hand, we have a picture in which the delicate, flowing rivulets anastomize and form a network. 98 Here we have an entirely different picture. The whole has been made to oscillate and vor- tices have appeared at once. As soon as the tone is discontinued, dispersion is resumed in the manner seen in figures 96, 97 and 103, and this continues until the gradient has ceased to exist. 99, 100 If a doughy mass is pulled apart, the surfaces do not reveal a random but rather a characteristically organized pattern. This phenomenon of dehiscence produces tree and branch-like patterns, delicate filigrees and fine networks.

The masses are transformed into vibration patterns: turbulences, vortices, wave fields appear. Upon the sound being discontinued, the weaving, wandering \"red structures\" reappear; centers, cells, flows and current networks emerge again. Once again the inter- play of this hydrodynamic pattern with its rhythms, to-and-fro motions, and periodic floating movements is domi- nant. Gradually the concentration gradient disappears. One more phenomenon demands our attention and that is the dehis- cence of doughy masses. If such a mass is torn apart, curious structures are revealed. These forms can be accurately described as dendritic (Figs. 99, 100, 101,104 and 105). This dehiscence can be most simply pro- duced in the following manner. A layer of the doughy plastic mass is placed between two glass plates. The glass plates are then drawn apart and the cohesion of the mass is overcome. The result is that the mass is torn apart. The appearance of the two sur- faces is dominated by structures which interbranch and interdigitate in conformity with a law (Figs. 99-101, 104 and 105). These formations change depending on the consistency of the material and the quantity used. \"Trees\" can be produced, then fine \"bushes\", filigree patterns, the most delicate network, and cellular textures (Fig. 101). What the eye perceives here is the regularly patterned tear of 89 "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"the mass. Dehiscence proceeds in such a way that true periodicity is revealed in its appearance. Any number of similar examples could be adduced, but these three must suffice. A number of analogies immediately spring to mind in this con- nection. The Liesegang experiment invokes the picture of a zebra, the sys- tematic banding in the plumage of many birds, and the regular banded and criss-cross patterns of pigmenta- tion in many species of animals. The to-and-fro hydrodynamic pattern is reminiscent of the circulatory systems in the lower animals or in the devel- opment of the embryo. And there is no end of organizational forms which are brought to mind by the dendritic structure of dehiscence. Nevertheless such similarities and interpretations as these, derived as they are from ex- ternal appearances, invariably and in- evitably peter out in generalized state- ments which are devoid of authentic meanings and never reach the real unity of things. Each phenomenon must speak for itself and must be stud- ied in its own terms. If the examples adduced here are studied along these lines, they not only display periodicity as a general feature, but they also re- veal that this periodicity has various aspects.

To trace these elements down to their minutest mani- festation, to grasp what is really hap- pening, to observe the pulse and for- mative rhythm in milieu and medium, to recognize those aspects of the phe- nomenal world which are permeated by the essential nature of vibration, waves, and periodicity—these are the activities characteristic of the cymatic process.

The stroboscope reveals that some objects are, as i t were, hovering, or at least that their adhesion to the surface under them is reduced. When iron filings are distributed on a vibrating diaphragm in a magnetic fieid, the re- duced adhesion is revealed by the fact that iron pa rticles acquire certain de- grees of freedom and their arrangement in the magne tic field is a mobile one. Large polar figures are formed which move as the de nsity of the magnetic fieid changes, but in addition to these, the iron p articles also form figures which migrate together and, if the direction of the magnetic field changes, take up an appropriate disposition. Figs. 106 and 1 07 represent such pat- terns of iron filings. If the direction of the magn etic field in Figs. 106 and 107 is changed, the erect piles of filings are mobile e nough to respond by a change of inclination. These processes and others like the m, direct the attention to the environment of vibrating objects, to the space surrounding them. What happens when the sound impinges not on flat layers, but on more substantial masses? If a readily plasticized mass is placed on the diaphragm, the mate- rial is set in motion. The masses are pushed to-and -fro. Whereas the field empties in various places, in others the substance forms lumps. Whole land- scapes are plastically molded; a kind of relief whi ch is a reflection of the vibra- tional processes is shaped out of the material.

It was to study the action of sound on a three-dimensional element. Because of their high surface tension, drops of mercury are globular elements which have a very strong tendency always to return to this ball shape and to maintain it. Under the influence of sound, large quantities of mercury show wave patterns, vortices, etc.; that is, hydrodynamic phenomena like other liquids. Drops of mercury on the other hand, always behave as homogeneous elements within cer- tain limits: they only fly apart when the amplitude is high. What happens then to such a drop? It must be remem- bered that reflections make photogra- phy very difficult. The photographer had to take appropriate measures in order to photograph the whole phe- nomenon without dazzling reflections. 108,109 A plasticizable mass is formed into balls by oscillation.

Changes in the surface were rendered visible by the resulting deformations in this mirror image. 111-113 The surface upon which the drop of mercury is resting is made to vibrate. Concen- tric waves are the first effects to be produced by a small amplitude (low tone). Figure 111 was excited by a frequency of 150 cps. and figure 112 by a frequency of 300 cps. A figure (triangle, hexagon) is already apparent in fig- ure 113. At the same time, currents become evident in the drop, often in the form of twin vortices. In Figs. 110-113, the lens is reflected in the drop as a dark, round circle. This is actually an advantage in that curva- tures on the surface of the mercury are rendered visible by the distortion of the mirrored image of the lens itself. In Fig. 110 the resting drop of mercury can be seen. As sound is applied, concen- tric rings are formed (Figs. 111, 112). Then a carefully managed crescendo causes vibrational patterns to emerge (Fig. 113). If the action of the sound is more intense, the whole globe of mercury is affected, and since the whole coheres and remains a unit, the oscillation can be revealed as a formative factor. The series of figures 118-123 illustrates this phenomenon. We see spatial sonorous figures which are tetragonal, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal and octagonal in shape, and there are many other forms. The production of these shapes is very accurate, but not rigid throughout. Here again the stroboscope reveals pulsations. For instance, a drop can move in such a way that two triangu- lar figures pulsate through each other: the figure oscillates in these triangular forms. In addition to these pul- sations there are also currents within the mass of mercury. A few lycopodium spores strewn on the surface make these visible. Here again we find our- selves concerned with a whole series of oscillatory activities within a system. Figs. 114 and 124 show a lateral view; the three-dimensional character is manifest.

In order to study vibrational pat- terns and dynamics in space, sound was applied to a stream of gas. Be- cause its specific gravity is greater than the air and its temperature lower, the gas falls like a waterfall from a height of about 35 cm. This downward movement causes turbulences, which can be seen in Fig. 115. The gas flows in a complicated pattern with eddies and unstable wave formations. These turbulences are of particular interest in that they render the environment sensitive to the effects of sound. Sound-sensitive flames are known to become sensitized only by distur- bance, i.e. by turbulence in the stream 114 Figure 114 shows that the configurations obtained in these experiments are truly spatial in character.

A turbulent medium is sensitive to vibration; sounds can make their influence felt in a turbulent medium. Hence the tur- bulent gas reacts to acoustic irradiation. Fig. 115 shows the situation before acoustic irradiation. Figs. 116 and 117 show the picture under sound bombard- ment at various frequencies. Patterned elements appear as sequences of lay- ers (Fig. 117) or as lattice-like arrays (Fig. 116), accompanied by vortical for- mations. Here again we are confronted by an exceptionally complex series of events: unstable currents, turbulence and vortex formations on the one hand, and an organized pattern on the other; both representing the effect of vibra- tion on the stream of gas. It need hardly be stressed that Fig. 115 reappears when the sound is discontinued. Even this small group of basic experiments will have shown that there exists here an extensive field for research. It is a question of studying the effects of vibration when they are transposed from more or less two-dimensional to three-di- mensional experiments, or put more simply, of seeing what happens in the various experimental arrange- ments in space. It can hardly be doubted that a whole phenomenol- ogy will be revealed in vibrating spaces, in spatial vibrational fields, or in pulsing or oscillating spheres.

It is not a question of reading an interpretation into these phenomena; the observatio nal work reported here must rather fertilize perception and, as it were, provid e the nucleus for the formation of a perceptive organ sensitive to periodicity. Thi s is not a matter of speculation, but of empiricism and of the thought inherent in th is empiricism, \"intuitive judg- ment\" as Goethe so concisely expressed it.

In the present experiments th e cooling process was used in order to observe the solidification of a su bstance. A kaolin paste is heated; it liquefies and is then poured onto a vibr ating diaphragm. Wave fields are created and typically, standing, traveling and interfering waves appear. Figs. 134 and 135 afford views of these \"wavescapes \".

It rolls, turns on itself like a ram's horn and is plasticized in volutes (Fig. 138). These processes and their formations are reflected in the figures which have formed on the diaphragm and are in the process of solidifying.

They are true den- dritic formations which can be pro- duced again and again in this typically serial configuration. What exactly is revealed in this series of experiments with solidifica- tion? If we follow the course of events, we find first of all wave phenomena, which are the prototypes of periodic- ity. These are followed by formations and organized patterns. At the same time different forms of movement ap- pear: rotations, circulations, to-and-fro motions, pulsations. But these pro- cesses are caused purely and simply by vibration and nothing else. Period- icity is inherent in them, it lies in their nature to be rhythmic, whether in form, in configuration, in movement or as a play of forces. Sculptural shapes are actually formed. It sometimes seems as if one is vouchsafed a glimpse into the origins of Baroque. All these phe- nomena take their rise in the field of vibration and owe their existence to vibration. They have therefore origi- nated in vibration and are in some measure its specific effects; vibration produces a multiplicity of effects or is poiyergic. In the course of these experi- ments pure periodicities appear which coact and interact; sometimes form is dominant, sometimes move- ment: sometimes the picture be- comes organized as a pattern and there is real configuration, sometimes 103 "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"131 Minor changes in viscosity bring about changes in the forms seen. The liquid has been rendered more fluid. When greater amplitudes are used, the masses are flung high and ejected. The experiment can be continued in this direction until the liquid forms a spray. The waves also increase in height and look like cups or pots although they are also in a state of flow. 132 These fluid, flowing sculptures assume any number of different forms. Wall-like waves rise in some places. Where trains of waves interpenetrate in lattices, the waves rise in columns. Even these phenomena which persist for some time are \"living\". The mass flows and pulsates within itself. If the tone is stopped, the liquid returns to its uniform state . 133 If the liquid is of a more viscous charac- ter, figures of the most varied kind take shape. The club-shaped configuration seen here has actually been raised out of the mass by the vibration. It is not a finished sculpture but a configuration in a state of flux. The substance flows up the stem of the club and circulates. These figurines also pulsate in themselves. They may also move around depending on the topography of the vibration. Such pro- cesses are not purely adventitious but can be reproduced systematically. 104"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"134,135 The transition from the liquid to the solid state while under the affect of vibration can be seen in this and the following figures. The process can be exemplified by cooling, evaporation, chemical rearrangement, etc.The liquid state is invariably taken as the starting point. Oscillation causes the substance to form waves. Figures 134 and 135 show wave fields of this kind. What can still be seen here as static liquid becomes solid and rigidities during the experiment. everything is in a flux, in a plastic flow. A certain polarity becomes evident; for it is not inappropriate to speak of po- larity when on the one hand the object assumes form, even a rigid form, and on the other hand, moves, finds itself in constant change, and appears as fluid form and as formative flux. Since alt these aspects are essential and necessary parts of the picture, since they all represent exclusively the ef- fects of vibration and are caused by the same vibration, they fall, as it were, into a series of their own accord. Tak- ing this idea of polarity as basic we have a spectrum of phenomena run- ning at one end into the figurate, into shapes, into organized patterns and textures, and at the other end into movement, circulation, into streaming and flowing, into kinetics and dynam- ics, The whole is created and sustained by oscillation, the most explicit and typi- cal expression of which is the wave in the widest sense. What it all boils down to is this, we must keep on asking ourselves as Goethe did: \"Is it you or is it the object which is speaking here?\" If we were to establish rigid definitions and split up the various manifestations into sections, we should be artificially dismembering the phenomenon by applying the analytical instrument of the intellect. If the phenomenon is to remain vital, its spectrum must be grasped as a fluctuating entity. True, there are significant forms there; but what we have to evolve is the con- cept of moving form and formative movement. 105 "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Sharply defined patterns emerge, but they flow away into nothing. Row- ing patterns and patterned flux appear before us. Thus, the problem of cymatics exists not only in observing in the experimental field but also in formulating concepts with which to press towards comprehension of the actual realities. In attempting to leave the cymatic phenomenon intact and unharmed in our intuitive vision, we can derive from it the following spec- trum with form at one end and move- ment at the other: figurate, patterned and textural on the one hand, turbu- lent, circulating. Kinetic and dynamic on the other, and in the center, act- ing in either direction, creating and forming everything, the wave field, and thus as causa prima, creating and sustaining the whole, the causa prima creans of all — vibration. So that we can describe and de- fine conditions from many different points of view, we will illustrate and explain a further example. This time it concerns a viscous liquid. Here again the material is irradiated with sound. In this instance not only the frequen- cies and amplitude are modulated but the liquid itself is changed by modifi- cation of its viscosity.

Fig. 144 shows a series of waves seen from above. Then round forms appear. Interesting tran- sitions can also be found. Fig. 128 shows a picture in which the sequence of undulation is still clear, but already there are intimations of an encircling rampart which, as this process begins to dominate, flows together to form a round shape. These round shapes reveal a radial circulation within themselves. Yet, also inherent in them, is the wave principle which now however, appears as an annular for mation (Fig. 145) The ring form may appear with a high degree of perfec- tion (Fig. 146). This double-ring form looks as if it has been turned on a lathe or a potter's wheel. In spite of its perfect shape, it must be imagined as constantly rotating. In other places on the vibrating diaphragm movement processes arise as amplitude and fre- quency are changed. The mass creeps around in vermicular forms. In Fig. 147 one can see such a formation which is readily derivable from the round shape (Fig. 146). If the vibraiion is now increased (corresponding to a crescendo for the ear), the round configurations rotate more rapidly. The processes are intensified. The wave rings rise up to form walls (Fig. 130). The masses lift up into peaks (Fig. 148). Crypts like honey-combs are formed while, close by, the waves rise high. There are pillar-like promi- nences: column waves and wave col- umns. The mass shoots up, is hurled 107 "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"away in the form of spiculae (Figs. 149,150). Protuberances of every kind are thrust up, some with explosive dy- namic force, others in apparent tran- quillity. We say \"apparent\" advisedly because in all these objects, in the eruptive as well as the persistent, the stroboscope reveals pulsations, turbu- lences and currents. Figs. 131, 132 and 148-151 are a series of photo- graphs showing these processes. The round shapes and their ring for- mations can be recognized; the pro- cess of intensification leading to wave walls and wave columns can be followed. The enormous dynamic force which ultimately causes the mass to atomize can also be seen. In everything we find the effects of vibration undergoing a series of changes. The highly specific charac- ter of the relationships between the factors involved is recognizable in the following pictures. Viscosity has been increased compared with the preced- ing series of experiments. The mass is now more gluey. Now organized patterns imprint themselves. The round shapes display radial ribs; so do the \"worms\"; they even undergo actual segmentation (Figs. 152, 153). If the amplitude is now increased, a process emerges which is entirely different from that witnessed when amplitude was increased in the experiment with highly fluid substances. The mass rears up; it assumes a shape like a figurine. Fig. 133 shows a club-like excrescence.

At certain places on the diaphragm, depending on the different vibratory topography, they move around, and run to-and-fro in the vibrational field. These descriptions, which take account only of the most important as- pects, have a bewildering effect on many people at first. The \"profusion of appearances\" is difficult for the mind to grasp. But this is a stage which must be passed through. One can then, of course, proceed to analyze this or that category; but always one must return to the whole, otherwise one is left \"holding the pieces in one's hand\". Analysis is essential, but the eye and the brain must restore what they have dissected to the active phenomenon and reintegrate it with the complex reality so as to see it again in the nexus in which it is alone existent. In order to get one's bearing, the processes here can once again be ten- tatively categorized without injury to their fluctuating character. Once again we have, on the one hand, figures, configurations, organized patterns and formations, textures and webs: on the 142 In experiments with \"solidescence,\" curi- ous effects resulting in figurines are repeatedly observed. The tall, columnar figure is driven up by vibration. At the time the photograph was taken, the mass was still viscous.

Once again the waves are a kind of middle category; they are the periodic element par ex- cellence. But here again it must be noted that it is the essential character of the waves, their characteristic peri- odicity, that is the basic causative fac- tor throughout. For the whole drama of these phenomena is played by the vibrational orchestra of an oscillating diaphragm. The phase we have reached in our study is characterized by the discov- ery of a spectrum of phenomena. It can be approximately described in the following terms: figures, organized patterns, texture, wave processes in the narrow sense, turbulences, kinet- ics, dynamics. These terms are not conceptual pigeon-holes: they do not package reality. They are derived from empirical perception. We will therefore leave the spectrum in this form for the time being. Whether it can be developed further, and if so, how, are questions to be dealt with in the next chapter. 143 In the following series of experiments the remarkable diversity of the phenomenol- ogy of vibration will be shown. Fundamental changes are produced not merely by varia- tions of frequency and amplitude, the charac- ter of the material is also a factor. Very small differences in the viscosity produce entirely different formations.

These aspects however, are not separate entities but are derived from the vibrational phe- nomenon in which they appear in their \"unitariness\" . Even though one or the other may predominate in this or that phenomeno n, we invariably find these three elements present. In other words, the s eries we have formulated is in reality confluent in homogeneous activity. It is not that we have configu- ration here and organized pattern there, but that e very effect of vibration bears the signature of configuration, movement and a play of forces. We can, so to speak, melt down our spectrum and observe the actio n of its various catego- ries as a continuous play in one and the same entit y. If we wish to describe this single entity, we can say this: there are alwa ys figurate and patterned elements in a vibrational process and a vibrational effect, but there are also kinetic and dynamic elements; the whole is of a per iodic nature and it is this periodicity which generates and sustains everything . The three fields — the periodic as the fundamental field with the two pole s of figure and dynamics — invariably appear as one. They are inconceivable without each other. It is quite out of the question to take away the one o r the other; nothing can be abstracted without the whole ceasing to exist. We c annot therefore number them one, two, three, but can only say they are thr eefold in appearance and yet unitary; that they appear as one and yet are th reefold. All the examples in this book can be considered from this point of v iew. It will be seen from the selection shown in these pages that in every ca se there are formations, 121"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"textures, and forms, we can see movements, currents , circulations, rota- tions, etc. and yet all these display throughout a rhythmic, serial, vibrational character. Hence we cannot say that we have a morph ology and a dynam- ics generated by vibration, or more broadly by peri odicity, but that all these exist together in a true unity. This can be seen fr om all the experiments de- scribed here; all the examples adduced are — whatev er their variations — recognizable as this unitary element. It is therefo re warrantable to speak of a basic or primal phenomenon which exhibits this thre efold mode of appear- ance. It must be stressed that this is an inference made from appearances. The basic threefold or triadic phenomenon is not a preconceived conceptual form which is forced on the nature of things: these things themselves are the basic triadic phenomenon. It might be argued and discussed that this is not r eally a true morphol- ogy, but only a vibrational form, not an inherent d ynamics, but a vibrational dynamics, etc. If, however, we restrict ourselves t o experience and speak its language, we shall find that we speak of every metamorphosis and varia- tion in terms of the basic triadic phenomenon. But the few examples given here do not exhaust the phenotypes of this phenomen on. Using this basic phenomenon as a perceptive organ (not as a dogmatic formula) we can watch and observe the most varied fields to see whe ther the language of periodic triadism is also current there. As far as research has proceeded along these lines, it has been found that this basi c model is fundamental to the most varied fields and constitutes an essential part of their nature. Con- tact with scientists and research workers in the mo st diverse areas of study has afforded wide vistas of this kind. We are thus confronted with the con- crete research task of starting a monograph on peri odic phenomenology which would cover many different fields. The basic triadic phenomenon is an empirical notion which comes to mind in the stud y of histology, cell physi- ology, morphology, biology and functional science; likewise in the study of geology and mineralogy, and atomic physics, astrono my, etc. This does not mean that this basic theme should be inflated to be a model of the universe; the interpretation of phenomena calls for subtlety of mind and love of re- search. Rather than blunt the reader's mind with co untless references, we shall describe in detail one example to show how th is basic phenomenon appears in a specific case and how appropriate it i s as an instrument of knowledge for probing into fields of research. This one example will serve for many. It is concerned with liquid or water phys ics. In order to give the reader some idea of the subject we shall quote some appropriate passages on hydrophysics. First we quote from Wolfgang Finke lnburg's Einfuhrung in die Atomphysik, (1954): \"Since it is at first sight surprising to claim that liq- uids have a quasi-crystalline structure, we will lo ok first of all at the most 122"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"important evidence supporting this contention. Dire ct evidence is provided by Debye's method of X-ray diffraction in liquids. If the molecules and the distances between them were completely irregular, t he intensity of scatter- ing would decrease uniformly as the scattering angl e increased; if the mol- ecules are in a regular arrangement, the X-rays sca ttered by the various molecules would show peaks and dips in the intensit y plotted against the angle of scattering, and these have in fact been ob served. If the scattering curves are obtained for the various geometrical arr angements (i.e. liquid structures) which might be considered possible and compared with those found empirically for a liquid, the particular mole cular arrangement in the liquid can be ascertained with some accuracy provid ed the case is not too complex. Recently the distribution of atoms in liqu id mercury has been accurately studied by Hendus by means of monochroma tic X-ray irradia- tion. At a temperature of 18 o C he found an atomic arrangement which was almost exactly the same as that of the crystalline state and substantially different from the densest packing of particles exp ected in liquids.\" Further evidence for a quasi-crystalline arrangemen t in liquids can, according to Sauter, be found in the fact that the specific electric resis- tance of pure metals increases surprisingly little on the melting point being exceeded. The measurements appear to be consistent with the existence of crystalline groups of 50 to 150 atoms. \"Another no less cogent proof of the semi-crystalli ne structure of liquids is to be found in the fact that a value of 6 cal./M ol. degrees has been obtained for the atomic heat of monatomic liquids s uch as mercury and liquid argon, which is twice the value to be expect ed for freely movable atoms whose three degrees of translational freedom each contribute R/2 to atomic heat. In crystals, on the other hand, the building blocks vibrate around a position of equilibrium so that there is a dded to the contribution of the kinetic vibration energy of 3R/2, the same a mount again for the potential energy of mean equal magnitude generated by harmonic oscilla- tion. The atomic heat of solid bodies is consequent ly (on all degrees of freedom being excited) 2x3 R/2 = 6 cal./Mol. degree s. The fact that this value is found for monatomic liquids can be explain ed only by assuming that here again there is a three-dimensional oscill ation of the atoms around a position of equilibrium with the difference that, in contrast to solid crys- tals, these centers of oscillation themselves perfo rm a translational move- ment which depends on the temperature. \"There are a number of other optical and electrical measurements which afford equally cogent evidence in favor of a crysta lline-like arrangement of the molecules of a fluid.\" In order to make the exa mple more specific, we will give further extracts from Finkelnburg's Einfu hrung in die Atomphysik 123"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"dealing with the constitution of water. \"In general the existence of strong dipolar or quadrupolar factors brings a complicatio n into the normal struc- tures of liquids by reason of the formation of chai ns of molecules (e.g. in the alcohols) or clusters of molecules in the 'associat ed' fluids, whose anoma- lous behavior is due to the formation of these mole cular clusters. By far the most important associated liquid is water, whose an omalous behavior has long been attributed to association. Whereas ideas have hitherto been focused on polymeric molecules of the type (H 2 O)n, whose degree n has been held to be constant and impossible to determin e, it has recently been concluded on good grounds that what is actually inv olved is molecular clusters of indeterminate size. The precise crystal line structure of these molecular clusters was ascertained by comparison of theoretical X-ray scat- tering curves and those actually observed: they wer e found to be tridymite- like in structure with each 'O' atom surrounded in tetrahedric configuration by four 'H' atoms. However, as might be expected for b onding reasons, two of the 'H' atoms were bound rather more firmly to an ' O' atom and hence more closely to it than the two others which were bound to it only by hydrogen bridges. This special geometrical arrangement of th e H 2 O molecules, i.e. the semi-crystalline structure, is the reason for t he special position water is generally known to occupy. Similarly the change in the structure, and thus the characteristics, of water, by the introduction of relatively few ions (or the addition of a little alcohol) is now understandable : the tridymite structure of water, which is determined by typical secondary val ency forces (van der Waals forces) is seriously disturbed by the electro static forces of the ions or the addition of even a few large foreign molecules, and at least the size of the molecular cluster is influenced. Conversely, th e addition of a few H 2 O molecules to pure alcohol has no noticeable effect on its chain structure, and indeed the properties of alcohols are scarcely affected by the addition of small amounts of water. Other more subtle proper ties of liquids ascer- tained empirically can thus be understood by refere nce to their crystalline structure in terms of atomic theory.\" From Pohl's E infuhrung in die Physik. (1959) we quote: \"A liquid is a crystal in a state of turbulence with very small but still crystalline elements of turbulence. As 'i ndividuals of a higher order' these elements are in a state of constant change an d go through move- ments and rotations which proceed in common.\" What impressive insights this affords us! One must realize what an epochal change this represents in our idea of liqui ds and particularly of water. The problem that concerns us here is the way in which physicists are striving to obtain a conceptual picture of wate r. Let us look at the facts: pattern (crystalline-like, quasi-crystalline, semi- crystalline) on the one hand, and on the other turbulence, movement, both in a fl ux of constant change. 124"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"It would be wrong to state that what we have here i s the basic triadic phenomenon. All we can say is this: the search for a conceptual picture moves along the lines suggested by this basic pheno menon (periodicity, pattern, kinetics). From the very nature of things this aspect must be con- tinually recurring in research and constantly confr onting the astonished eyes of the researcher. How extensively the triadic nature of vibration is found, is brought home to us when we realize that the complex organization s of movement, of rhyth- mic systems (circulation and respiration), and of n erve physiology become evident to us as frequencies and modulations includ ing amplitude modula- tions. We spoke at the beginning of striated muscle and its real vibration; cardiology is, of course, \"rhythmicity\" par excelle nce. Neurology is a field of frequencies and the laws to which they conform (cf. the wave bands of electroencephalography). These systems have pattern s of a serial nature and a dynamic of rhythmic impulses. The electrogram s are, of course, only the bioelectric expression of processes which are o f a chemical, thermal, energetic, kinetic and structural kind. The dominan t role of the periodic in other organs and their functions is merely mentione d in passing. (Protein synthesis, the model of genetic information in the living cell, respiratory enzyme chains, catalysis, etc.) And now into the organization of the locomotive sys tem, of the circula- tion and the respiration, and of nerve activity — a ll of which have their being in rhythmicity — living, experiencing man now impla nts himself. He lives in these fields in that he grasps them and acts with them in them on them through them and only thus takes on a tangible appearance himsel f. We used the term \"implant\". In point of fact in. say the vibrational field of skeletal muscle, man has developed to the point where he can now manifes t himself in and through this medium (facial expression, gesture, gait, danc e). The same holds true for breathing, the stream of breath, the formation of s ound. The physiological periodicity of nature is raised to a higher plane b y the development of rhyth- mic activities on the basis of physiological fields of rhythmicity. An example of this elevation to a higher plane is the way in whic h organic periodicity devel- ops into speech. Speech is a pure field of rhythmic phenomena; here again we have kinetic dynamics, here again there is confi guration (tonoscope). By drawing attention to these relationships, the na tural scientist is in no way straying from his proper domain; indeed it i s in this way that the phenomenon of man can be grasped by the senses and by the intellect 125"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"through the operation of the empirical method. For how could man develop and operate a speech organ unless he himself were a manifestation of the basic triadic phenomenon at a different level.* Ser ies are revealed leading from the vibrating to the dancing muscle fiber from respiration to speaking or singing, from the frequency modulation of the ga nglion cell to the scientist's formation of ideas, Again and again, and in ever new forms, the cymatic method reveals the basic triadic phenomenon which man can feel and conceive himself to be. If this method can fertilize the relationship b etween those who create and observe, between artists and scientists, and th us between everyone and the world in which they live, and inspire them to undertake their own cymatic research and creation, it will have fulfill ed its purpose. *In actual fact these studies lead by their very na ture into fields which are beyond the scope of this work to discuss. Contact with artists, soci ologists, psychologists, jurists and historians has shown us that not only the idea of general peri odicity, but also the notion of a triadic world model (the trinity of configuration, wave, po wer) have validity in these fields. Rhythms in history; resonances, interferences, standing and traveling waves in human relations; the wave-like rise and fall of memories, thoughts and e motions in a periodic manner; poetry and music — all these are themes which have been illumi nated by this concept of the basic triadic phenomenon during our conversations with nu merous personalities. These views must be described elsewhere. But it must be stressed tha t these affinities are not merely metaphors or analogies, but involve the recognition of homolo gous systems. 126"}]
