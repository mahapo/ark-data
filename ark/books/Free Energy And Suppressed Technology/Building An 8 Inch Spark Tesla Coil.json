[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Building An 8 Inch Spark Coil By H. WINFIELD SECOR Associate Member, American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Practical Electrics December 1921 Spark coils are not used so extensively in radio and other ele ctrical work as they once were, but dozens of experimenters often desire to build a large spark coil for op erating X-ray tubes and carrying on many other interesting experiments and researches. The present artic le contains data for building an induction coil giving a spark 8 inches long when it is operated on battery current at 18 volts potential; the current taken by it at this voltage is about 1 amperes, or the coil consumes approximate ly 80 watts. On lower voltages, the length of spark produced by the coil will of course be proportionately less. Several of these coils were built exactly as here described for commercial purposes some years ago, from the author's original design; the only difference in the coils built and the one here described is tha t a separate or independent magnetic interrupter was utilized, as the photograph of the finished coil shows, b ut the writer has built coils fitted with a double spring interrupter of the type shown in the drawings, with ex cellent success. Primary Winding of 8 inch Spark Coil . Before the primary winding can be put on the annealed iron wire cor e will have to be either made or purchased. This core is composed of as fine iron wire as possi ble. and a compact bundle 23 inches long by 1-1/2 inches in diameter should be used. This core should be a nnealed to the highest degree possible, and this point can be ascertained by means of a small pocket compass. F irst, the core is magnetized by placing it inside of a coil, through which battery current is passed, or els e the core may he placed in contact with a powerful magnet. What we want to measure is the retentivity of t ime iron for magnetism. When the current is shut off or the core separated from the magnet, the compass nee dle is brought near the ends and it should be barely attracted. thus showing that very little magnetism is retained by the core. If the core is not thought to be annealed sufficiently it can be further softened in one of several ways. One method is to place it on top of a coal fire in a stove or furnace until it becomes a light cherr y red or nearly so; it is then removed with pincers or tongs and buried in the ashes under the grate and le ft to cool very slowly for several hours. Some spark coil builders anneal cores in a gas or electric stove, red ucing the heat after the initial light red point has been reached about every half hour, when finally very little heat is applied to the core. This gives the same results as the first method. After the iron wire core is sufficiently annealed it should b e insulated by wrapping five layers of oiled linen or Empire cloth around it; either a wide strip or else tape may be used. Over this insulation the primary winding is wound, which consists of two layers of No. 12 B. & S. g age D.C.C. magnet wire. The primary winding when completed may he given a good coating of orange s hellac or else it may be soaked in hot paraffin wax or dipped in melted sulphur. The primary core an d winding is slipped into an insulating tube, as"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"shown in time drawings. The insulating tube, separating the primary and secondary w indings, must be very substantial and is to be composed of hard rubber, glass, bakelite, fibre, or micanit e. Bakelite and micanite are probably the two best choices. This insulating tube measures 23 inches long and ha s a 5/16 inch wall. The inside diameter of the tube is 2 inches and the outside diameter 2-5/8 inches. If the pr imary and core are a little small for the tube, they may be wrapped with a layer or two of oiled linen or waxed p aper, so as to fit in the tube snugly, and also to be centrally located within it. The Primary Condenser and Interrupter . The tinfoil and waxed paper primary condenser for the 8 inch s park coil may be made up in several ways. In the first place many experimenters will probably not want to bother to make the large condenser which is necessary, and will endeavor to purchase one of the proper siz e, or several small ones which can be connected in parallel to give the necessary capacity of 2.32 microfarads. The condenser of this coil will require 8,500 square inches of paraffin paper measuring .00 3 inch thick, coated on both sides with charging foil; or we may use 106 sheets of paraffin paper measuring 10 i nches x 12 inches, with 107 tinfoil leaves measuring 8 inches x 10 inches each. The drawing Fig. 2 shows ho w the condenser is built up and also the manner in which connection tabs may be brought out from diffe rent sections of leaves at the successive corners of the condenser. it is not particularly necessary t o arrange the condenser with switches or drum controller, as shown in Fig. 2, but where the coil is to be opera ted at different voltages this feature is often desirable, as the amount of capacity shunted across the vibr ator is greater as the primary voltage is increased; likewise it becomes smaller the faster the interrupter opera tes, so that when we have an electrolytic interrupter the speed of interruption is so rapid that no cap acity at all is necessary or desirable. The paper used in building the condenser may be ordinary whit e writing paper or typewriter paper which can be purchased at any stationery shop. The thickness should be checked before waxing with a micrometer. and it should be within a thousandth of an inch or less to the speci fications. The paper sheets are paraffined by using a large drip pan in which several pounds of paraffin wax is melted. Care should be taken not to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"overheat the paraffin as this destroys some of the insulating q ualities. The paper is waxed one sheet at a time. Thin copper or aluminum foil may also be used instead of tinfo il without lowering the efficiency. The tinfoil tabs forming a terminal may be tightly connected together by me ans of two large washers and a machine screw with nuts. In assembling the condenser, every other tin foil sheet is connected to the common terminal, as the diagram shows. Terminal 1 if the condenser is made adju stable, comprises all the tabs from the first 25 alternate foil sheets which are not connected to the common ter minal. Terminal 2 comprises the next 14 alternate foil leaves, while terminal 3 includes the final 1 2 alternate foil leaves. Note that condenser switches in any case have to retain their first connections as addition al capacities are switched in. The author has generally preferred the drum type controller illustrated in Fig. 2 for switching and retaining in circuit the successive condenser units. The double spring vibrator which has been used by the writer o n spark coils of all sizes up to 12 inches, is shown in Fig. 3. The contact spring may be made about half the th ickness of the armature spring which carries the soft iron button at its upper end. This interrupt er gives the highly desirable long make and quick break action, which results, as actual tests have proven, in giving about twice the spark length for a given coil, in comparison to the old single spring vibrator which rar ely permits the core to become fully magnetized before breaking the circuit. The general dimensions of the vibrator parts are given in Fig . 3 and these may be departed from to some extent without appreciably affecting the results obtained . It will be seen that the armature spring and soft iron hammer head, when it is attracted by the iron wire core proje cting thru the cabinet, will move forward some distance before button A, on the rear of the spring touch es the contact spring proper. The hole in the contact spring through which the stem of the button moves sho uld be made sufficiently large so that the action is free and positive. After building the coil and trying out the interrupter, the length of the button stem may have to be changed Until the circuit is broken at the most d esirable time to give the maximum secondary spark. One-eighth inch diameter platinum or tungsten contac ts should be used on the contact screw and spring and in some cases where these are not available, silver m ay be utilized"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Secondary of 8 inch Spark Coil. For average use it has seemed like too much labor to wind the sec ondary of even as large coil as an 8 inch one in small pies or sections, a fraction of an inch think alth ough this gives a very reliable coil and one not likely to break down its insulation very easily The present des ign which has been built and tested successfully, calls for but four secondary windings each un it measuring 4 inches long over-all. The drawing in Fig. 4 shows how the secondary units are wound and also how ev ery other one is reversed when placed on the insulating tube during the assembly of the coil so that th e current will pass around the secondary coils always ill the same direction, while the lead wires from the u nit coils will he connected together so as not to engender flash-overs or short-circuits Each of the four secondary coils should I be wound as follows: Wire required for each unit will he 2 pounds 10 ounces of No. 3 B. & S. gage enameled copper magnet wire, or a total of 10-1/2 pounds being required in winding one of these secondary units, paraffin paper 4 inche s wide should be cut from sheets either purchased or waxed by the builder, the paper being .003 inch t hick, measuring the parer before waxing of course. A layer of this paper should be placed between every l ayer of wire, the coil being wound on a wooden mandrel 2-1/4 inches in diameter, supporting the mandrel in a lathe or between two wooden uprights fastened to the work table. The outside diameter of the secondary unit s will measure about 4-1/2 inches. The waxed paper will extend 11/16 inch beyond the wire at each end of the layer, the length of a wire layer being 2-5/8 inches. By getting in touch with electrical winding concern s or spark coil manufacturers, these secondaries can very frequently be purchased at a labor-saving price, as it is quite a job to wind them. When all of the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Fig 5A secondaries have been wound, they are placed on the insulati ng tube, as shown in the assembly drawing Fig. 1 with insulating disks between them, the disks separating t he coils being about 1/8 inch thick and composed of hard rubber, bakelite or even fibre And equivalent thickn ess of paraffin paper sheets has also been employed. At either end of the secondary assembly there is pl aced a thicker square insulating piece measuring preferably about 1/4 inch thick or more. By referr ing to Fig.4 it becomes evident how the two inside leads of sections 1 and 2 are connected together, then the two outside leads of sections leads of sections 2 and 3 and finally the two inside leads of sections 3 and 4. This same scheme of reversing every other coil unit on the tube so as to obviate the possibility of having a high voltage lead passing across all of the layers of wire at the end of a coil, is employed for spark co ils having a greater number of sections. After the complete coil is placed in the box, the latter should be fi lled with woltein, paraffin, wax or sulfur. Operation of the Spark Coil The diagrams in Fig. 5 show several ways of operating the 8 inch spark coil. At \"A\" the circuit is shown for utilizing an electrolytic interrupter; it will usually be found desirable to employ an adjustable choke coil in series with the interrupter to control the current more effectively. This coil will give a 6 inch to 7 inch heavy flame at the secondary terminals when operated with an electrolytic interrupter from 110 volts D. C. or A.C. It is not desirable to operate this coil from alternating current as an open-core transformer, for it is not designed for that purpose, but it can be experimented with by using the proper adjustable choke coils or auth-transformer in the primary circuit to control the amou nt of current consumed. It will give a very much shorter spark with 110 volts 60 cycle A. C. passing thru the pr imary of course, possibly an inch or so in length. An interesting experiment maybe tried out with this spark coi l in connection with 110 volts A. C. 60 cycle service, using instead of an electrolytic interrupter, an elec trolytic rectifier, composed of alternate aluminum or lead plates immersed in a glass jar containing a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate. The closed core transformers as well as open core types used on many of the hig h voltage X-ray sets operate in this fashion. An adjustable choke coil or other means of control should be i nserted in series with the rectifier and the primary of the a spark coil. When using either the electrolyti c interrupter or the rectifier, it should be noted that the usual primary condenser and vibrator are left out of circuit. The rectifier clips off the half-waves of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Fig 5B Fig 5C Fig 5D the A. C. cycle. Fig. 5-D shows spark coil being operated from 1 10 volts D. C. by means of a potentiometer style resistance. Fig. 5-B shows the 8 inch spark coil connected to a glass plate condenser and Tesla or Oudin high frequency coil, several excellent types suitable for this spark coil having been described in detail by the author in the last issue of PRACTICAL ELECTRICS. Fig. 5-C shows the spark coil connected to au X-ray tube. When using a spark coil for operating X-ray tubes to the highest efficiency, the inverse current is partially eliminated by placing rectifier tubes in series with the secondary lead wires, as shown. A short spark-gap in series with one of the leads also helps to eliminate the weaker or inverse wave. In testing the length of spark from any induction coil, steel needle points should be used on both secondary terminals and care taken not to separate these beyond the sparking capacit y of the coil or else the secondary will be under a severe strain an d will possibly rupture its insulation. The polarity of the se condary current may be reversed with a double-pole, double-throw kn ife switch, or a double-pole drum controller connected in the primary circuit as shown in Fig. 2. By means of pole-test pape r, commonly used for checking up the positive and negative wires on D. C. circuits, the polarity of the secondary terminals ca n be determined. Another way of testing the polarity of the secon dary terminals is to attach two pieces of fine iron wire to the secondary terminals, and, when the spark passes between the m, the one which remains cold is the positive terminal, while the one that becomes very hot is the negative. In operating X-ray tubes, the polarity will invariably be indicated at once, as, wh en the wrong terminal is connected to the anode of the tube, it wi ll light up in different manner than formerly. The potential of the spark between needle points, with gap measuring 8.35 inches long is 90,000 volts. This value is for a sine wave form curren t such as is produced by the usual electric light and power alternator supplying current for lamps and motors. However , as the amplitude factor for the spark coil secondary current is approximately 3.23 the maximum potential of the 8.35 inch sp ark is approximately 290,700 volts; the value of 90,000 volts being the mean-square root value of a sine wav e potential yielding a spark 8.35 inches long.

The principal advantage of the independent interrupter is that you can adjust the speed of i nterruption and maintain it, which is not always the case with the spring interrupter fitted on the end of the i nduction coil itself, as the magnetic pull of the spark coil core acting on the vibrator will fluctuate with th e changes in the secondary load.
