It was sent in by an unknown customer about 2 years ago. The claim was so fantastic that it was hard to believe! It was then carefully constructed and tested, after testing the device he made some improvements on it and thus sprang forth a New Free Energy Heating Device that was 90 to 100% efficient in our opinion. Every home can use this new heating device right now! It is the safest h0ome heating source known in the world. And can save thousands of dollars in heating bills. This device is a free energy device not a perpetual motion device, Free energy is being produced and used but the device must use our free energy motor to turn it.

The Fuelless Heater is a simple and relatively easy to construct device that is proven to work! Some critics claim that the heater defies basic laws of physics. With an efficiency of 100% and more. It is clear that the internal energy of the atom is being tapped. When you trap an atom and apply pressure in the form of friction - temp., interesting things start to happen. Pauli's exclusion principle tells us that two electrons are not allowed to do the same thing, to follow the same course and especially to get near one another. Each time that an electron is forced nearer another electron, the other one must move away , refusing to share an orbit. So each time that an electron is forced to change orbits or levels, One QUANT A or One PHOTON of light - HEA T ENERGY is giving off! Each electron changing levels forces a series of other electrons into the same fate, Like a small chain reaction. Rotational, Excitational, Vibrational, electronic and other energies that we may not yet understand are each and all set off like ping pong balls in a room of self reloading mousetraps. Every home furnace or space heater uses a electric fan motor to blow the heated air in and around the rooms or room. we are simply using this same motor to do another function. T o turn the inside rotor drum that will in turn cause the atomic chain reaction in the liquid that is being used with in the inner part of the outer drum, reaction as stated above. A 5 amp solar panel can be used to run the blower fan motor, which will start the atomic reaction. ( Safe to use ) ( Cold Fusion ? ) It may be possible to use a very small electric fan motor, 12 vdc x 3 -5 amps and run it by solar energy and back up batteries. For fireplace and space heater use. The Resistance of the inner drum on the motor is very small. Over the years scientist have tried to invent a way to heat a home using solar electric panels, but failed, the energy it takes to heat a home is to much, it would cost a Solar Panel Customer over $15,000 in solar panels to even come close. and is still not enough to do the job. This heater is the answer to all our heating problems. A fuelless Furnace that uses atomic friction instead of fuel to heat an average size home for only $10 - $15 per month, FREE if the home owner uses one solar panel to run fan blower motor. or a Free Energy electric motor! I heard of a man who built this Free Energy Heater out of a 10 year old washing machine, can you believe that? That's how simple this is to make. He had an old uninsulated home and it was costing him over $230 to heat. His wife probably thought he was a nut! but once he built and tested it he hooked it up to a thermostat and bypassed it into his old Furnace and heated his home for just 50 cents per day.

Page 3 There are several ways to build a simple working model. The rotor and the stationary parts have the same geometry. This may be a cone cylinder or a drum shape. Start if you like with a small model using 2 tin cans. The one that fits inside the other should have about a 1/8\" clearance all around it's sides. and a 1/4\" space between the inside of both bottoms. Y ou can use a hand drill or best to use a small work bench drill press. ( Y ou will need one anyway if you don't have one ) The drill press is used to rotate the inner can which will start the atomic reaction with in the thin oil that is in the bottom of the can. I built my tin can heater and it produced 92 degrees in just 12 minutes! That's pretty good for just a small tin can model. and the smoother the side of the cans are the better results I got. Most tin cans have ridges on the sides of them, This is what I used first. but not recommended Tin cans from the late 50's and 60's would be great to use! I spinned the inner can at, 1700 rpms. This small demo is to prove to you that there is an atomic free energy reaction taking place inside the oil or water. be sure to make your tin can heater well. use high temp automotive silicon to attach parts. Y ou can use the old lid to the outer can and glue it back in place with silicon glue. you will need to drill a hole in the ceneter of the lid for the shaft to ride through.

It is of the atomic type. Y ou maybe thinking that the friction from the rotor shaft riding on the bottom plate pivot hole is producing all of this great heat! WRONG! Once you have your first prototype built, first try it without oil or water of any kind, the results will be -0- . Y ou will get nothing. Now try pouring in a small amount of thin oil on the bottom and turning it again. WOW! see what I mean. There is an atomic reaction taking place which I believe is cold fusion and it is a safe atomic reaction as far as my test have noticed. hundreds of people are already using this heater with no problems that I have heard of. There are ways to up grade and make it better! Another unit was built with about a 30 inch diameter cup shape rotor. It used about a 1/2 or 3/4 horsepower motor. The cup does not have to rotate at a high speed. ( Remember a cup shape is different than a drum shape. ) The temperature can easily reach 200 degrees or 300 degrees f. This device heated a 16 room mansion for around $30 per month! ( They should have used a free energy motor or Solar Panel to run the Fan Blower. it would have cost - 0 - $. I believe that the liquid molecules are set into greater motion due to the rolling friction between the stationary and the rotating cups. At the outer most diameter the molecular motion is the greatest and slowly decreases toward the bottom. Aluminum is the best material to use for the outer drum or cup that does not move. For you research people: A mechanical resonance can also occur in the liquid at the right thermal vibration. This will increase the heating action. Other constructions, sizes and shapes can produce CA VIT A TION and SHOCK W A VES! The design and geometry has a lot to do with it's overall performance. The world is seeing a new type of energy production here using the same old type of atoms that have been here on the earth since God created the earth. These atomic cold fusion heaters can be very simple in design and can be operated at very low speeds as well as high speeds. NOTICE: I you like you can send us a picture of your finished heater and any new ideas we can pass along to others like your self would be greatly appreciated. I hope you enjoy working with this new and awesome invention as much as I did. There is yet so much more to discover!

Outer drum does not move. The inner drum shaft does not go all the way through as shown. This would cause an electrical magnetic short. The atoms are then moved in a way as discussed earlier. I also believe a electrical and magnetical flux from the atoms are taking place and causing the inner drum to work as a shorted out high amp generator, thus causing HEA T! I believe this to be 2 actions of energy taken place! this is why there is so much free energy heat! The liquid can be any type of liquid such as; Coke, = soft drinks, coffee, Oils, Transmission fluid, Brake fluid, Water etc... I have found it best to use transmission fluid, but I am still researching this. see what you can come up with. See page 1. The Fuelless Heater is a True free energy machine! Of the Atomic type. If you use oil in yours it should take about 5 to 10 years for the heater to consume the oil. These units can be made to heat your hot water and generate electricity for your home using a steam turbine. Please send us a photo of you and your heater after you build it. Inner drum shaft bolt 1/2\" hex bolt with head cut off, nut, 2- washers & one lock nut, centered in top of drum, which we are using an empty 1 gal paint can. this works great because the lid comes on and off, for easy assembly. 1/2\" bolt hole will need to be 1/16\" bigger once you have attached and lined up your flange bearing,( if one was included in your kit.) or just run your unit for a while and the wear and tear will make hole bigger. apply grease to this area.

This improvement was invented by Rick & Dave of Creative Science and Research, this will be an improvement to all other US patents that this heater now has. As may not know, by rotating a steel drum in a strong magnetic field this will produce heat within the metal drum which is acting as a shorted out generator thus causing heat! This combined with the Oil friction heat method will produce a higher efficient heater! As you see below I use 4 high voltage DC pulsed electromagnets. The iron core is not like the iron used in transformers or other magnets. we want this metal to become a permanent magnet by the off and on pulsing of the DC coil. So I use a cold steel metal or such again unlike iron cores that are used in motors etc.. the engineers do not want the metal to become permanently magnetic. but in this case I want it to as much as I can! This will also save on energy and produce a higher power pulsed electro magnet and will produce greater heat from such a small device. The steel core is laser or die cut to a special curve and each laminated piece can be about 1/8\" to 1/4\" thick using cold steel. The DC pulse is much like the Ed Grey Electrical Patent, using capacitors to step up the 12 VDC solar panel voltage to a high DC voltage of about 600 DC volts x 1 amp, the back emf ( Which is free energy from a collapsing magnetic field ) is collecting and placed back into the 12 volt dc deep cycle battery. Again use a 5 amp 12 volt solar panel with 2 deep cycle 12 vdc storage batteries. and you will also need a Solar V oltage controller, Of course you could hook all of this up to your home electric using a step down transformer of 24 to 36 vdc and using one storage battery and still produce a high efficient overunity heater. Copyright and Patent pending 2000 to 2003 High Voltage Electro magnets Qty of 4 DC Motor High efficiency The coils can be wound with about 1,000 to 2,000 turns of #26 copper coated wire. Notice the top of the magnets in this drawing are cut off just for display purposes, the windings go all the way around the steel core. If you need to learn how to build high voltage magnets see our #HVEMP plans for $19.95 plus shipping. NOTICE! very important the 600 VDC pulse is only activated at every 2 to 6 seconds. as the steel gets more powerfully magnetized the pulses get longer, like every 15 to 25 seconds. # 878P"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"A friction heat er having a heat insulat ive housing containi ng inner and outer members with at least one member mounted for rot ation relative to t he other on a common vertical axis, causes oil to rise up into an annular li quid chamber between the members during rotation to generat e friction heat .
