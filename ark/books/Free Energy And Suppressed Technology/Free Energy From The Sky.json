Fr ee Electricity Fr om The Sky ? F act or fiction? I t is fact! Y ou may have read in old hobby books from the 1950's how free - power ed radios bec am e famous in connection with electronic eavesdropping in \"The Electronic Invasion\" and later appeared in magazine articles and T V shows. Th ere are two ways to collect free ener gy from the sky , one is from r adio and television wav es and the other is from the earth and sky itself . Collecting free ener gy from the earth and sky is the way we prefer to go. F or example: the earth can be used t o conduct free electricity all over the world to power homes , cars airplanes etc........ In the early 1900's an inventor named Nikola T esla invented a way to pump high ener gy electricity into the ear th using a his T esla coil. T esla Said that the earth is like a capacitor , “ the earth is as a spherical capacitor plate with the ionosphere as the o ther plate ” . The frequencies that work best with this system are 12 Hz and it's harmonics and the storm frequency around 500 khz. from the earth to the outer or inner ionosphere is 6 0 miles. For example if you used a helium balloon and had a copper wire str e tched from it to the earth you c ould collect up I heard of a man that lived up in a mountain top area and by collecting the ener gy from the earth and sky , collected enough power to powe r his entire home ! He simply used a lar ge metal screen and pl aced it at the highest point on the mountain top, he then ran a lar ge 8 gau ge copper electrical line from the screen to his cabin which provid ed the hot leg. For the ground leg he used a 8 foot copper pipe that he pounded into the ground, he then connected an 8 gauge copper wire to the copper ground pipe at the bottom of mountain . I was not told if he collected DC or AC 20,000 v? if it was DC then it would be very simp le to use a very lar ge step down transfor mer by pulsin g the 20,000 vdc into the prima ry of the transformer . T his would turn the 20,000 vdc into ac and at the same time lower the ac to a 120 vac , the primary dc pulse wo uld have to be pulsed at 60 rpm . A HV dry type capacitor would have to be used in parallel to the coil to reduce sparking and plasma arcs. 20,000 volts DC x 1,800 amps Page 1 # 3 7 1 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C r e a t i v e C r e a t i v e & R e s e a r c h P O B O X 5 5 7 N e w A lb a n y , IN . 4 7 1 5 1 U S A Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"# 3 7 1 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C r e a t i v e C r e a t i v e & R e s e a r c h P O B O X 5 5 7 N e w A lb a n y , IN . 4 7 1 5 1 U S A Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research Page 2 Large aluminum collection grid ( Mesh type ) grid must not touch the earth, place it on plastic or wooden poles. 8 Gauge outdoor electrical wire runs to home and DC Fuse breaker box - +"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"# 3 7 1 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C r e a t i v e C r e a t i v e & R e s e a r c h P O B O X 5 5 7 N e w A lb a n y , IN . 4 7 1 5 1 U S A Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research Page 3 B y s e n d i n g u p a m o d e l r o c k e t i n t o a c l o u d w i t h a c o p p e r w i r e a t t a c h e d t o t h e b o t t o m o f t h e r o c k e t a n d t h e o t h e r e n d g r o u n d e d t o a c o p p e r p i p e c o n n e c t e d t o t h e e a r t h y o u c a n c r e a t e a n a c t u a l l i g h t i n g b o l t .

High voltage can kill. W ear rubber gloves and rubber shoes. Free News Earth ground \"A typical lightning flash involves a potential dif ference between cloud and ground of several hundred million volts, with peak currents on the order of 20,000 amperes.\" The electric current in a lightning bolt is measured in amperes (A). An ampere is defined as the constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, with negligible cross sections, and placed one meter apart in a vacuum, will produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 x 10-2 newton per meter of length. A single lightning bolt is extremely powerful; measured in thousands and hundred thousands of amperes (kiloamps or kA). All of my sources on lightning basically dif fered from each other , ranging from a value of 1,200 amperes to about 200,000 amperes, but because in all cases the results I found were approximations or generalizations, some sources were closer in value than others. It is my opinion that lightning can be saved and stored, not the full bolt but the energy that travels from it can be saved in our earth capacitors, see our plans #459"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"# 3 7 1 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C r e a t i v e C r e a t i v e & R e s e a r c h P O B O X 5 5 7 N e w A lb a n y , IN . 4 7 1 5 1 U S A Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research Page 4 Most Ham operators know better than to disconnect an antenna and then pick it up later by the connector and touch a ground. An enormous charge can build up on an insulated wire! ( the longer the wire the more charge that will build). Many ham radio and CB operators have learned to pick up the coax and tap or hold the antenna against the case of the radio to bleed of f this charge. But no one ever thought to use this free energy to charge batteries! Using a long wire antenna you can charge batteries to run motors or run your radio. T ry hooking up a sparkplug to the end of the wire and then run the ground end (where the threads are) into a 12 volt coil of f an old A model, but any old coil will do. The bottom connector of the coil that used to go to the points is hooked to the positive side of the battery . The negative side of the battery is hooked to a good earth ground and a 1 to 3 KV capacitor (a few picofarred type like those found in the horizontal section of a television chassis) is hooked from ground back to the wire where the top of the sparkplug is connected. That's about it! Nothing should be touching ground except the ground post of the battery . Use about 200 feet of insulated wire and it will completely charge a 12 volt deep cycle every 2 or 3 days! A thousand feet of wire will do it a lot quicker but the voltages approach lethal levels. So how can this be? Why does it work so well? It works because the long wire acts like a capacitor and builds a charge on the wire. When a few thousand volts are reached, it will discharge by \"sparking\" across the sparkplug. The sparkplug delivers the charge to the coil that steps it down to a few hundred volts and pulses the battery .. The weather controls how much static electricity is in the air . I heard of a man who hooked a small neon bulb to a full wave loop one winter night during snow and high winds, the bulb burned continuously all night long! The higher you get the wire of the ground the better . The wire has to be completely insulated. It doesn't seem to make any dif ference whether you lay it out in a straight line or weave it back and forth. Length is the important thing here, not size. Old phone wire or old coax from the cable company will work! ( anything that is insulated and long will do the job). Again please notice that we have not yet tried to build and test this set up. W e recently heard about it and thought it might be good to include it as another option in collecting free energy from the sky . If you get it working please let us know . Thanks David waggoner Another Free Energy from the Sky Option! The following is information we have read from another inventor , but have not yet tried!"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"# 3 7 1 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C r e a t i v e C r e a t i v e & R e s e a r c h P O B O X 5 5 7 N e w A lb a n y , IN . 4 7 1 5 1 U S A Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research Page 5 As you can see t here are many ways to collect free ener gy from the sky an another for example: Again anyone who has read earlier hobbyist electronic handbooks will remember the Famous Free - Power Radios which went on to fame in connection with electronic eavesdropping in the electronic invasion. Just imagine a 3 mile FM transmitter only l\"x 1\" and placed in the area were you want to monitor and using this system your FM (BUG) will work forever until discovered, it's a little scary isn't it! Any one can be listening to you r conversations at any time and you would not even know it. This simple circuit shown will provide enough power to drive a small T ransistorized amplifier , Receiver , or a small motor , make 10 of these and parallel them together or in series and you will be able to collect much more power! The circuit is essentially a radio receiver (crystal detector) tuned to the loudest signal on the band. But c an a person get enough power to power your home?

Our first experiment involved the use of only one antenna, later we used more antenna’ s by stacking them and achieved far greater results. The more antenna you use the faster the charge and the more voltage and power you will be able to collect. Get your antennas up as high as you can get! If you live in a nice neighborhood you may want to try placing your antennas in your home attic. Our first prototype consisted of one CB antenna placed 20 feet up on a building structure. And one 200 mile range TV antenna. W e first tried the CB antenna and collected over 300 volts ac we then attached the tv antenna and the CB antenna together and got 3 times that. The capacitors we used were electrolytic and rated at about 400 volts x 47 uf and placed in series to equal 6,000 volts. The diodes we used were silicon 1000 v x 2 amp placed in series as well to equal 6,000 v the ground was connected to the lab 120 volt wall outlet ( Ground only ) it is less dangerous to use a copper pipe placed into the earth. + Cap + Cap + Cap + Cap + Cap + Cap Diodes Capacitors Earth Ground Diodes and Capacitors can be purchased on line, search for electronic supplies!"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"# 3 7 1 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C r e a t i v e C r e a t i v e & R e s e a r c h P O B O X 5 5 7 N e w A lb a n y , IN . 4 7 1 5 1 U S A Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research Page 7 Y ou will find this invention very interesting! T aking from a US Patent dated in 1957 Coil and capacitor are tuned to frequency of a radio transmitter from which the diode rectifies the signal and delivers a D.C. pulsating current , a full wave rectifier would give a better output. T o deliver an increase in power several tuned circuits could be coupled together . Results obtained from a 5 Kilowatt standard broadcast station from five miles away using only an indoor antenna to pick up the power signal. 2.5 to 3 volts at 0.5 to 1 milliwatt. A longer outdoor aerial would give better results Please note that the newer coils using ferrite rods give a stronger signal and the coil can be substituted by one made by your self, A few turns are only needed to receive the stronger short wave stations such as radio Australia. Of course you would use your own short wave station in your country . I have found that insulated steel wire coil gives better results than copper . The diode should also be a geranium type in preference to others types of diodes used."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"# 3 7 1 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C r e a t i v e C r e a t i v e & R e s e a r c h P O B O X 5 5 7 N e w A lb a n y , IN . 4 7 1 5 1 U S A Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research Page 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"# 3 7 1 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C r e a t i v e C r e a t i v e & R e s e a r c h P O B O X 5 5 7 N e w A lb a n y , IN . 4 7 1 5 1 U S A Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"# 3 7 1 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C r e a t i v e C r e a t i v e & R e s e a r c h P O B O X 5 5 7 N e w A lb a n y , IN . 4 7 1 5 1 U S A Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research Page 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"# 3 7 1 S C I E N C E S C I E N C E S C I E N C E C r e a t i v e C r e a t i v e & R e s e a r c h P O B O X 5 5 7 N e w A lb a n y , IN . 4 7 1 5 1 U S A Copyright 2002 - 2004 Creative Science & Research Page 11 Question?
