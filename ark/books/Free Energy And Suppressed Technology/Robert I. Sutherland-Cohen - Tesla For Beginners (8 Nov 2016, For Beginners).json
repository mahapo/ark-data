Lonely man, forgotten person, rejected fringe scientist,ridiculed idealist, crazy bird-lover. Rediscovered scientist, inspiration tomany, honored builder of the future, fascinating character. All of these labelsapply to the same person at different times.Nikola Tesla, recognized and honored for achievements early in his career,forgotten and ignored toward the end of his life, and noticed again in recentyears, has become a hero to fans all over the world. Rediscovering thecontributions to society made by this formerly unsung genius, people are nowbecoming aware of how his work underpins so much of the technology we take forgranted today.Tesla's work and ideas continue to inspire. As president of Tesla Science Centerat Wardenclyffe—the site of his last laboratory on Long Island, New York—I havelearned first-hand of the unique appeal of this Serbian-born innovator andeccentric. When we first set out to save Wardenclyffe, it was just to save apiece of history and start a small museum where children could learn aboutscience. But the more we learned about the man whose vision brought us forwardwith his technological breakthroughs, the more interested we became in Teslahimself. To our delighted surprise, the rest of the world agreed that Tesla wasimportant, too. Contributions came from across the globe. His name and renewedfame brought together over 33,000 people from 108 countries around the world whocontributed to saving his cherished final worksite.Tesla sought to make life better for everyone. His work was dedicated toanswering the questions he had, and to building the technology we would need forthe future. Concerned about our finite resources, about efficient use of energy,and about improved communications between people, he thought about and developeddevices, technology, and systems to improve our lives.From the alternating current system of electrical distribution upon which all ofsociety depends, to alternators for cars, flow meters for aquatic vessels,robotics, remote control, radio, and so many other inventions and concepts,Tesla has led the way in technology. Over a hundred years ago he envisioned ahand-held device that could connect people all over the globe with pictures,voice, music, and information. Today we hold in our hands a smart phone thatembodies that very idea. Free energy from the earth and wireless distribution ofenergy—other goals of his—are still to be realized, but scientists have begun towork on those possibilities.Tesla is also a character in current television and film productions. Fromnetwork channels to public television to cable stations, many programs have beendevoted to Tesla's life and work. Feature films have been and continue to bewritten, developed, and made about him, or including him. Others are in theplanning stages.With a car company bearing his name, a science center being created in hisformer laboratory, new investigations being made into his science, and filmsbeing made about his life, Tesla is again the fascinating figure he once was.A true futurist, Tesla realized that people wouldn't necessarily understand himin his own time. But it was for the future, now being realized, that he worked.In his own words,Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work andaccomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I have reallyworked, is mine.With all the new interest in Nikola Tesla and his work, the demand forinformation is growing. There have been several scholarly works published inrecent years that reflect this interest, but they tend to be aimed at those whowant in-depth, heavily-footnoted, detailed information. This volume is writtenwith students and general readers in mind. Tesla For Beginners provides anintroduction to the man and his accomplishments. In this work of graphicnonfiction, students of any age can find solid information and background abouta genius who gave so much to the world.Jane Alcorn is President of the Tesla Science Center atWardenclyffe, Shoreham, NY (www.teslasciencecenter.org[http://www.teslasciencecenter.org])"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONOVERVIEW OF A GENIUSSTOP. BEFORE YOU READ ANY FURTHER, take a few moments and note all the devicesthat are powered by electricity within 10 feet of your body's radius. You willbe astonished by the number. Imagine how this number grows exponentially as youbroaden the circle beyond the room, throughout the building, around the block,and out across the world. It is hard to imagine that one man was responsible forinventing the process, the machinery, and the distribution network that deliversalternating current (AC) to power all these devices.Image [images/p001-001.jpg]Oh, by the way, are you reading this book under fluorescent lighting? Or perhapsyou are listening to a radio at the same time. Maybe a television is on. And isthat a cell phone ringing in your pocket? These are just some of the inventionsor devices that employ ideas or circuitry invented by this same man, who filednearly 300 patents in his lifetime. Many of these patents resulted infunctioning inventions. Others were little more than wide-eyed dreams—or stillawait possible development.The man behind alternating current and wireless technologies traveled fromSerbia by steamship to arrive in the United States with only four cents in hispocket. It was in the early 1880s, at the tail end of the Industrial Revolutionand the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution, that America beckonedhim.Into this age of wild, individual invention strode an idealist with a head fullof potential improvements that would radicalize the distribution of electricalcurrent, boost the well-being of society, and contribute to world peace. Hewould tangle with some of the most brilliant minds in America's history,including Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, J.P. Morgan, and Stanford White.His social circle was legion, among them Mark Twain, Robert Underwood Johnsonand his wife Katharine, poets, musicians, and writers. Such notables flockedaround him in hopes of profiting one way or another from his plans for globalwireless communication systems.He achieved financial wealth and worldwide recognition even though he outlinedsome disastrous proposals that never came to fruition. Ultimately he took aprecipitous fall. He spent his last decades scraping for funding for celestialprojects and living out his final days in penurious solitude with a pigeon.This poet of invention, possessed of a prodigious memory and deep-seatedphobias, has left behind a vast and intriguing legacy. He was a scientist, aphysicist, a mathematician, an electrical engineer, a writer of verse, and anextensively published author.So let's explore the enigmas, visions, dreams, and plausible realities of thistowering but sometimes overshadowed figure of modern science and invention:NIKOLA TESLA."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1BEGINNINGSAnd God said, Let there be light . . .—Genesis 1:3PRECISELY AT THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT, as the clock turned from July 9, 1856, toJuly 10, 1856, Nikola Tesla was born in the village of Smiljan, in themountainous Austrian province of Lika. (Lika is a historical region of Croatiaand is located today in the Republic of Croatia. At the time of Tesla's birth,however, it was part of the Austria-Hungarian Empire). As both lore and his ownautobiographical writings tell us, Tesla came into being amid a raging lightningstorm. Whether or not he was possessed with God's prophecy, it was indeed hisdestiny to light up the world. And while he is credited with achieving just sucha mythical feat, he was first and foremost a man of nature, scientific inquiry,and prodigious invention. A view into his early years, inventive process,phobias, reasoning powers, reclusiveness, dreams, and survival tactics comes tous through his autobiography, My Inventions (1919).Image [images/p003-001.jpg]HOMELANDThe world of Smiljan has a long, volatile history, caught up in what we now knowas the warring Balkan states. Lika and other regions in Croatia were underAustria-Hungarian rule beginning in the mid-1800s, while neighboring Bosnia wasunder Turkish control. Both Croatia and Bosnia fought for years to gainindependence from their ruling powers. Once they obtained their freedom—andright up to the present day—the diverse factions in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, andSlovenia continued to fight among themselves and their neighboring states.Following World War II, Croatia became one of the six constituent republics ofthe Yugoslav socialist federation. Once again, Croatia fought for its freedomand engaged in bitter fighting with Serbia. The complex of shifting bordersacross this region of the world gave rise to the word balkanization.Image [images/p004-001.jpg]BALKANIZATIONThe division of an area, country, region, or group into smaller and oftenmutually quarrelsome units.It was in this geopolitical context and amid these natural surroundings thatNikola Tesla spent his childhood. Smiljan lay across the western edge of theAustria-Hungarian Empire's military frontier. Many of its men were conscriptedto go off and fight wars, while others chose a religious path. Meanwhile, thefemale residents back home eked out a living on hardscrabble farms, oftenplagued by famine. By the time of Tesla's birth, a decline in Turkey's controlof the surrounding area gave rise to civilian administration.Although Tesla was born in Croatia, his parents were of Serbian descent.Milutin, his father (1819–1879), was a minister who graduated at the top of hisclass. He had no desire to pursue a military career, as so many of the men inhis family had done. Tesla's mother, Djuka (translated as Georgina) Mandic(1822–1892), was the daughter of a priest. Her family lineage included many whochose a career in the clergy. Shortly after their marriage in 1847, Milutin wastransferred to a parish in Senj and later to one in Smiljan.Milutin was a pastor, writer, and poet with an extensive library on wide-rangingsubjects. He strongly desired independence from the Austrians and Turks, as wellas everlasting peace. Milutin spoke many languages, was adept at mathematics,and trained his sons to perform calculations in their heads as well as feats ofmemory.Although Djuka could not read, she committed to memory long passages from theBible. She was a dutiful homemaker, who in her own right was an inventor of manyhousehold items. Working from sunup to late in the evening, she would run thefarm and household. Her sewing abilities were renowned, aided by looms shedevised herself. To help prepare meals, she invented churns and labor-savingkitchen devices for their small, isolated farm. Both parents shared a sense ofthe spiritual and viewed life beyond the rigors of farming. Their quest toimprove the human condition was not lost on the young Tesla. The fourth of fivechildren, he was closest to his mother and shared her work ethic, as well as hersense of invention for tools that would better the world.EARLY VISIONS AND SCIENTIFIC INTUITION“Our first endeavors are purely instinctive,” Tesla would write in hisautobiography, “prompting of an imagination vivid and undisciplined. As we growolder, reason asserts itself and we become more and more systematic anddesigning. But those early impulses, though not immediately productive, are ofthe greatest moment and may shape our very destinies.”A number of events in Tesla's childhood life were to have a marked effect on hisfuture as an inventor, dreamer, strategist, and communicator in differentrealms. Young Nikola spent much of this early life amid birds, chickens, geese,sheep, horses, and cats. It was an extensive immersion in the natural wondersaround him. He went to great lengths to talk to the animals, especially hisfavorite cat, Mačak.Stroking Mačak on a cold, dry winter night, Nikola observed sparks of lightemanating from the animal's backside. His father explained that this was staticelectricity, much like that seen during lightning storms. It was the same kindof electricity one was able to produce by rubbing one's feet on a rug, resultingin a spark when touching another person. Tesla was fascinated. He reasoned thatthe jolt of electricity was a kind of power or energy, and he wondered: Howcould he produce greater quantities of electricity? What would he have to doincrease the output of these electrical forces? Then, how could he utilizeelectricity to power machinery? As he recalled at the age of 80, these were allgrand ideas circulating in his head at an early age.Image [images/p006-001.jpg]I cannot exaggerate the effect of this marvelous night on my childishimagination. Day after day I have asked myself “what is electricity?” and foundno answer. I still ask the same question, unable to answer it. Somepseudo-scientist, of whom there are only too many, may tell you that he can, butdo not believe him. If any of them know what it is, I would also know, and mychances are better than any of them, for my laboratory work and practicalexperience are more extensive, and my life covers three generations ofscientific research. (“A Story of Youth Told by Age”)Image [images/p007-001.jpg]In addition to communing with the farm animals, Nikola was close to his elderbrother Dane (b. 1848) and formed more distant relationships with his sisters,Angelina (b. 1850), Milka (b. 1852), and Marica (b. 1858). Much of his playtimewas spent intermingling with nature, observing cause and effect. The forces ofnature—such as the power of flowing water and wind—were very real to him. Inparticular, the impact of water current on floating objects took shape in hismind. How would he transform these myriad thoughts into reality and usefulpurposes? These were his seeds of invention. From a young age, he beganformulating ideas for translating natural forces into the transmission of usableenergy.By observing how a flowing stream could propel a toy boat, for example, he beganto formulate variations of the physical event. For a budding inventor, this wasthe magic “what if?” moment. Nikola theorized that the water's current wouldhave the same effect on a wheel or disk, which would rotate if mounted on anaxle hovering perpendicular above the flowing stream. A portion of the disk justbelow the axle would be immersed in the water and would spin in directrelationship to the current pushing against it. With that theory in mind, Nikolaconstructed just such an apparatus and noted the resultant effects. How hisobservations would figure in his future would require the test of time. For themoment, these were early hints of his thought process for the invention of asmooth-disk turbine (PATENT 1,061,142 – FLUID PROPULSION, filed October 21,1909, and PATENT 1,061,206 – TURBINE, filed October 21, 1909).Image [images/p007-002.jpg]Air flight was another concept that loomed large in the boy's mind, so much sothat he took to leaping off the barn roof with umbrella in hand to ease hisdescent. He spentanumber of months in bed healing.In addition to experimenting with physical phenomena, Tesla believed stronglythat he possessed the ability to both communicate and predict events beyond thenatural order of things. He was convinced that his sensory apparatus went beyondseeing and hearing the things right in front of him. He claimed that he couldhear a small object dropped in another room or at a great distance, and that thesound of unseen objects at times became so deafening that it caused himintolerable headaches. On one occasion, he visualized the death of his catMačak. When later told the exact details of his pet's passing, the accountconfirmed precisely what he had seen in his mind.Image [images/p008-001.jpg]Similarly, in thinking about a possible invention, Tesla would pose a series ofquestions to himself and work through the potential solutions. Ultimately,release would come in the form of what he regarded as complete clairvoyance fora practical invention. At other times, he imagined that he could reach rightthrough the space in front of him and touch aspects of the image. If he sawsomething, he wondered, would it be possible to invent a device that couldproject the image as his eye saw it? Obsessively he grappled with these ideas.And though nothing came of many, they were the earmarks of the intensescientific inquiry that gripped Tesla from a very early age.Another unique childhood invention came about through his observation of theforces of wind. Living on a farm, it would not be far-fetched to assume that hewas able to observe the effects of a windmill in the threshing of grain. But,young Tesla wondered, what if there is not enough wind to turn the mill?Melding what he learned from the water-driven spinning wheel, he devised asystem of pulleys that attached a wheel to a model windmill. Then he tethered acollection of May flies (June bugs in North America) to the windmill's vanes.The frantic flapping of the bugs' wings set the wheel in motion. Nikola proudlyshowed off his invention to a boy in the neighborhood who proceeded to eat thebugs. The sight of him gobbling the bugs so disgusted Tesla that he vowed neverto harm an animal again. And according to one biographer, he never repeated theexperiment in the rest of his life.Nikola eagerly moved on to other juvenile experiments. He would tinker endlesslywith clocks, taking them apart but never succeeding in putting them backtogether. As military weapons caught the fancy of many a young boy, heconstructed a popgun in which he utilized forced air-pressure to propel a wad ofhemp. The result was a few shattered windows. In another flight of invention andimagination, he fashioned his own swords and waged war against an imaginaryadvancing army of cornstalks. Such adventures aroused the ire of his parents,but for Nikola they were the beginnings of his life-long search for what makesthings work.One particular image came to haunt him for the rest of his life. It occurredwhen he witnessed his brother Dane being thrown by their favorite horse. Theresulting injuries led to his brother's death at the age of 12. The incidentreplayed itself in his mind, in stark detail, throughout Tesla's life. Dane'sdeath was a cause of great anxiety and frequently distress. Tesla's fixationswould lead to crippling headaches and mental breakdowns on numerous occasions.Often his memories would be accompanied by brilliant flashes of light inside hismind, as if war was being waged in his head.EARLY EDUCATION AND THE POSSIBILITY OF ADVANCED POWERYoung Nikola Tesla had looked up to his brother. Dane's death in 1861 was astunning blow not only to young Nikola; it proved devastating to their parents.No matter what Nikola did, he felt that he lost favor with his parents. Hismother seemed to reject whatever he tried to do. His father Milutin had grown sodespondent that he carried on conversations with himself, changing voices forthe imagined participants in the conversation. Eventually he requested atransfer to another parish. When the request was granted, the family moved tothe nearby town of Gospić. The move turned Nikola's world upside-down. It brokehis heart to part with his pigeons, chickens, sheep, and magnificent flock ofgeese. He felt like a prisoner in his new house and grew increasing bashfularound outsiders.Various eccentricities and obsessive behavioral patterns also began to emerge inTesla around this time. Some of these were manifest throughout his life. Hereacted violently to the sight of women's earrings. Pearls gave him fits. He wasfascinated by glittering crystals or objects with sharp edges and planesurfaces. He would not touch the hair of other people. The sight of a peachwould make him feverish. A meal would be joyless if he didn't calculate thecubical contents of soup plates, coffee cups, and pieces of food. Counting stepswas another obsession, and all repeated acts he performed had to be divisible bythree. If not, he would repeat the actions until they were.EIDETIC MEMORYToday psychologists refer to the kind of imaging that Tesla experienced asEIDETIC MEMORY. This is the ability to picture a past occurrence inextraordinarily vivid detail, sometimes triggering strong new thoughts orfeelings.One incident somewhat brought Tesla out of his shell and endeared him to thecommunity. With much pomp and circumstance, the townspeople gathered at theriver to unveil their recently purchased fire pump. Upon completion of thespeeches and ceremonies, the command was given to pump. Not a drop of waterissued from the nozzle, and no one on the scene could solve the problem. Knowinga little about air pressure, Nikola dove into the river and instinctivelyuncrimped the collapsed suction hose. Water gushed from the nozzle, making Teslaa local hero.Nikola gained much of his knowledge from reading the many books in his father'slibrary. His mind roamed far and wide as he immersed himself in the literature,poetry, and stories of distant lands. Milutin wanted Nikola to follow a clericalcareer path and feared that the boy would ruin his eyes from so much reading.Much to his father's consternation, Tesla would fashion candles, seal thekeyhole and cracks around his bedroom door, and read in secret long into thenight. The lack of sleep did little to affect his daytime activities, and it wasa work pattern he would adapt to throughout much of his life.Eventually his early fascination with flowing water and wind currents gave riseto more grandiose ideas of water turbines. He found a number of turbine modelsaround his school and enjoyed building and operating others. A picture anddescription of Niagara Falls imprinted in his imagination a giant wheel run bythe giant waterfall. So powerful was the image in young Tesla's mind that heboasted he would bring his vision to reality one day.Image [images/p011-001.jpg]JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL—FORMULATING THEORIESAt the age of ten, Nikola Tesla enrolled in the Real Gymnasium (Junior HighSchool) in Gospić. There he displayed an astonishing skill in mathematics—hecould visualize and calculate long strands of mathematical problems in his head.So great was this proficiency that one professor accused him of cheating when hewas able to rattle off solutions to problems without a piece of paper to do thecalculations.As good as he was at mathematics, however, his drawing ability was below par.Tesla felt little inclination to make pictures or diagrams, as the effortinterfered with his thought process. The inability to draw threatened to spoilhis career.Worse, his daydreaming and inability to distinguish between reality andimagination became troublesome. Seeking the will to separate the real from theimagined, he began to search within himself. At the age of twelve, he stumbledacross a Serbian translation of the romantic novel Abafi: Son of Aba, byHungarian author Miklós Jósika. Tesla would later say,This work somehow awakened my dormant powers of will and I began to practiceself-control. At first my resolutions faded like snow in April, but in a littlewhile I conquered my weakness and felt a pleasure I never knew before—that ofdoing as I willed. (My Inventions)Such mastery of will became a great meditative tool for Tesla, enabling him toaccomplish many brainy feats throughout his lifetime.The scientific apparatus and various electrical and mechanical models thatNikola discovered in the school's physics lab were especially intriguing to him.They offered him the opportunity to experiment with motors, electricity, andwater turbines. His efforts were guided by extensive readings on electricity.Meanwhile, he continued to harbor his dream of flying. He reasoned that if hewere able to apply steady air pressure to a cylinder within a vacuum, he couldproduce continuous forward motion. Then, a shaft inserted into the cylinder witha propeller on the other end would provide lift.Image [images/p012-001.jpg]With the idea of a flying machine fixed in his mind, young Tesla was able totake imaginary journeys around the world. Looking back, his idea was aforerunner of what we now call a helicopter. Indeed it would lead directly tothe future invention of the Tesla turbine. However, there was a flaw in theapparatus that did not dawn upon the inventor until many years later. As hewrote in My Inventions,It took years before I understood that the atmospheric pressure acted at rightangles to the surface of the cylinder and that the slight rotary effort Iobserved was due to a leak. Tho [sic] this knowledge came gradually it gave me apainful shock. (My Inventions)Tesla's derring-do and heroics continued during his Real Gymnasium years,further illustrating his deductive reasoning powers on air pressure and watercurrents. As he would later put it,An inventor's endeavor is essentially lifesaving. Whether he harnesses forces,improves devices, or provides new comforts and conveniences, he is adding to thesafety of our existence. He is also better qualified than the average individualto protect himself in peril, for he is observant and resourceful. (MyInventions)Those instincts came dramatically to the fore in two near-death drowningincidents. The first came about out during a swimming prank played on friends.Diving under a wooden raft, he expected to disappear under water and resurfaceon the opposite side. Underneath the floating structure, however, he becamedisorientated. He tried repeatedly to resurface but kept banging his head on theunderside of the raft. Almost at the point of blacking out, he realized thatthere would be airspace between the deck of the raft and the supportingcrossbeams just beneath it. Gasping for air, he made his way from one pocket ofair to the next and—after his friends had lost all hope for hissurvival—eventually resurfaced on the other side. It was a frightening way tolearn about surface tension and air pressure.In another act of death-defying bravado a few years later, Tesla swam out to anearby dam. Generally, the water rose within an inch or two of the wall of thedam. On this day, however, the water flowed fast and strong over the top of thedam. As Tesla approached the edge, the currents began to carry him over the top.At the last moment, he was able to grab hold of the wall and hang on with bothhands. But as the water pressure against his body increased, his strength beganto give out.Thinking quickly, he remembered a diagram he had seen on one of the basicprinciples of hydraulics: the pressure of a fluid in motion is proportionate tothe area exposed. With that in mind, Tesla turned onto his left side. This madehim like a swimmer slicing through the water, rolling from side to side witheach arm stroke. With less of his body opposed to the water, turning onto hisside had the effect of lowering resistance and improving propulsion. Beingleft-handed, Tesla was able to drag himself to safety on the opposite bank.Aside from torn skin along his left side, Nikola survived with only a fever.Lying in bed in the weeks that followed gave him an opportunity to think aboutways to utilize the energy differences in air pressure to drive water turbinesand motors. Already taking shape in his mind was a continuous-motion machinethat would work by maintaining steady air-pressure in a vacuum and harnessing(like his earlier flying machine or a windmill) the rush of incoming air.Upon recovering, Tesla plunged into his scientific studies—so much so, in fact,that he again became dangerously ill upon completion of courses at the RealGymnasium. Once again, he used his convalescence to read constantly. Included inhis readings were the novels of Mark Twain. Upon meeting Twain a quarter-centurylater, Tesla moved the author to tears when he related how the books had spurredhis recovery. That encounter was the basis for a longstanding relationshipbetween the two men.HIGH SCHOOLNikola's extensive readings prepared him to enter the Higher Real Gymnasium(High School) in Karlovac (Carlstadt), Croatia, and further his science studies.In Karlovac, he lived with his aunt (father's sister) and her husband, a formermilitary officer who had participated in a number of battles. Life with them wassheer grief for young Tesla. They fed him sparingly, and he contracted malariasoon after arriving in this low, marshy area. He remained on a steady regimentof quinine during his entire stay.To escape the misery, Tesla once again plunged into his studies. Under theinfluence of his physics professor, he became deeply absorbed in the study ofelectricity and mathematics. The professor demonstrated principles withapparatus of his own design, including a device in the shape of a freelyrotating bulb with tinfoil coatings that would spin rapidly when connected to astatic generating machine. Tesla was fascinated. The phenomena played itselfover and over in his mind, as he longed to know more about these mysteriousforces.Tesla worked at his studies with reckless abandon. From an early age, he wasconversant in a number of languages. By the time he graduated, he was fluent inSerbian, English, Czech, German, French, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Hecompressed his course work from the normal four years to three years.Tesla wanted to return home to impress upon his father how engaged he was withthe study of physics and electrical experimenting. This was the career path hehad chosen. Hanging over the young man's head, however, was his father'sinsistence that he enter the priesthood. And so Milutin was not ready to welcomeTesla home, urging him instead to go on a long hunting trip and re-think hiscareer choice. His ulterior motive was to shield Nikola from a cholera epidemicraging in Gospić.CHOLERAA bacterial disease usually spread through contaminated water. Cholera causessevere diarrhea and dehydration. If left untreated, it can be fatal in a matterof hours, even in previously healthy people.Unaware of the epidemic, Tesla disobeyed his father and returned home. His yearsof malnourishment, a weakened immune system, and his previous bout with malariamade him an easy target for cholera. His illness was so severe that within ninemonths he was knocking at death's door. With the end nearing, Tesla said to hisfather,“Perhaps I may get well if you will let me study engineering.” “You will go tothe best technical institution in the world,” Milutin replied.As Tesla slowly recovered, his thoughts turned increasingly to engineeringcollege. He and the family, however, overlooked the mandatory three-yearmilitary conscription looming before him. Milutin sent him off to the mountainsand, in the intervening year, apparently pulled strings with relatives in thearmy to release the young Tesla from his obligations.Trekking through the mountains, meanwhile, Nikola had visions for two of hismost outlandish inventions to that time. Both tested the limits of hismathematical knowledge. First, he imagined a tube that would run under the oceanbetween Europe and the United States. The tube would be able to channelspherical mail containers prodded through by water pressure. (The flaw in hisearly thinking was that he did not account for the drag of water on the sides ofthe tube. Resistance was an error Tesla was able to factor into his laterinvention of a steam turbine.)The second idea demonstrated similarly imaginative thinking and even moreimpractical execution. If he were able to build a ring around the earth at theEquator, Tesla hypothesized, anyone could hop on or off the ring to visit placesanywhere around the spinning globe during a 24-hour span.Once he had regained his health and his father was able to secure a defermentfrom military service, Tesla was finally positioned to embark upon his pursuitof an electrical engineering degree. His boyhood inventions, his earlyschooling, his ability to control his imagination, his sense of adventure, hismaternal influence, and his father's religious precepts all prepared NikolaTesla—and fired his resolve—to become an inventor."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2HIGHER EDUCATION—JOURNEY OF DISCOVERYImage [images/p017-001.jpg]Of all things, I liked books best.—Nikola TeslaIN 1875, TO APPEASE HIS FATHER, Tesla entered the Joanneum Polytechnic School inGraz, Austria, under the pretext of becoming a professor of mathematics andphysics. Living and studying more than 227 miles north of his hometown ofGospić, Tesla finally had the independence to pursue his training in electricalengineering, the life of an inventor, and all the courses that piqued hisinterest. In addition to the math and technology requirements, he took coursesin such wide-ranging fields as analytical chemistry, mineralogy, machineryconstruction, botany, wave theory, optics, French, and English. His studiesintensified as his interests broadened. He gained proficiency in nine languagesand memorized long passages from Descartes, Goethe, Spencer, and Shakespeare. Hetypically worked seven days a week, from 3:00 A.M. to 11:00 P.M., getting by onfour hours of sleep.Among his favorite teachers at the Polytechnic were Dr. Moriz Allé, who taughtintegral calculus and specialized in differential equations, and Professor JacobPoeschl, who held the chair of experimental and theoretical physics. Tesla woulddescribe Poeschl as,the most brilliant lecturer to whom I ever listened. He took a special interestin my progress and would frequently remain for an hour or two in the lectureroom, giving me problems to solve, in which I delighted. To him I explained aflying machine I had conceived, not an illusionary invention, but one based onsound, scientific principles, which has become realizable thru my turbine....Prof. Poeschl was a methodical and thoroughly grounded German. He had enormousfeet and hands like the paws of a bear, but all of his experiments wereskillfully performed with clock-like precision and without a miss. (MyInventions)LEARNING ABOUT ELECTRICITYProfessor Poeschl's teachings, in all likelihood, included a thoroughprogression from the earliest discoveries in electricity to the most currentknowledge of the day. A review of some of these advances is intrinsic to anunderstanding of the principles leading up to Tesla's own theories andinventions. It is also important to reemphasize the key question that neitherTesla nor scientists before or after him have been able to answer: “What iselectricity?” Indeed all we really know are the results of what electricityaccomplishes.Many centuries before Tesla stroked his cat Mačak to produce sparks and ahair-raising effect, the Ancient Greeks noticed that brushing amber with woolattracts very light materials such as straw. Much as Tesla's father Milutindescribed the effect to young Nikola, this was another example of staticelectricity.For years, budding electricians would collect mysterious electrical “fluid” (forlack of a better term) in Leyden jars. Once the jar was filled to its electricalcapacity, the experimenter could withdraw a charge and receive an electricalshock. Their hair could literally stand on end. This demonstration might havecontinued to be seen as a parlor trick were it not for Benjamin Franklin'skite-flying experiment in 1752, which proved that lightning was electrical innature. Fortunately, Franklin was not struck by lightning that day and lived towrite profusely on his electrical experiments.Image [images/p019-001.jpg]Especially important to Tesla and other experimenters was Franklin'sdetermination that electricity flows as a single “fluid” in two differentcharged states, positive and negative. Franklin assumed that electricity flowsfrom positive to negative, but that idea was disproved about 150 years laterwith the discovery of the electron. The negatively charged electron, it wasshown, was the basis for the direction of current flow.Franklin's invention of the lightning rod demonstrated that, if a metal wire isattached to the rod and strung down the side of a building and into the ground,the electricity generated by the lightning will run down the wire and into theearth, preventing damage to the building. The very notion of a lightning rod,the thousands of electrical discharges that take place during a thunderstorm,the erection of towering structures skyward, and the transmission of electricalenergy all resonated deeply with Nikola Tesla. He would go on to conduct relatedexperiments at Colorado Springs and Wardenclyffe at the end of the 19th centuryand into the 20th century, respectively.THE PHYSICS OF ELECTRICITYBenjamin Franklin's electrical experiments pointed to the existence ofelectricity, but they did not establish what it is. Following Franklin'sfindings, there was increased activity across Europe to codify what electricitydoes. Reviewing the most important discoveries is vital to understanding howTesla arrived at his own theories for electromagnetic induction to powermachinery. Each successive discovery or new theory regarding the properties ofelectricity and magnetism resulted in a series of formulas. These formulasutilized an international system of units to represent certain base units (SI).INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITSAn internationally accepted coherent system of physical units, derived from theMKSA (meter-kilogram-second-ampere system). Scientists use the meter, kilogram,second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela as the basic units (SI units)respectively for the fundamental quantities of length, mass, time, electriccurrent, temperature, amount of substance and luminous intensity.Image [images/p020-001.jpg]Building on Franklin's description of the flow of electricity, the pioneeringFrench physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb sought to provide a measurement ofthis flow. Knowing that certain materials, such as glass, rubber, and plastic,are electric insulators (charges can be rubbed on or off their surface and tendto stick there) and that other materials, such as copper, silver, and aluminum,are electric conductors (charges of electricity flow through them), Coulomb in1785 defined a measurement for the number of charge carriers passed any givenpoint in one second.COULOMBA simple household electrical circuit, such as a small “night light,” carries acurrent of roughly 600 quadrillion (6 × 1017) charge carriers per second!Engineers and scientists rarely write or speak about electrical current directlyin terms of charge carriers per second. Instead, they use units of coulombs persecond. A COULOMB (symbolized C) represents approximately 6.24 × 1018 unitnegative or positive charges.For Tesla or any other mathematician, 1017 condensed 10 to the 17th power andshortened a long string of numbers. Written out in long form, it would be 10 ×10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 ×10—i.e., 10 multiplied times itself 17 times successively. Given Tesla'sprodigious memory and ability to do mathematical calculations in his head, wecan assume that he was able to remember tables for powers of 10-prefixmultipliers and abbreviations. Taking our example above, a designator of mega-or M in a formula would be 106 for a positive power. A negative power isdesignated either nano or n in a formula and would be written 10-9. Thus, 5.3mega coulombs could be written as 5.3 MC = 5.3 × 106 C.Image [images/p021-001.jpg]After André-Marie Ampere proved (1820) that wires could behave like magnets whena current passes through them, an ampere or amp (symbolized A) became thestandard unit of measurement for electric current throughout the world. In SIbase units, a current of 1 coulomb equals 1 ampere per second. Mathematicallythis would be expressed as:Image [images/p021-002a.jpg]The early physics of batteries would be important to Tesla's understanding ofhow to actually store and produce electrical currents. In 1800, Italian CountAlessandro Volta built a pile of alternating copper and zinc metal disks,separated by paper pads soaked in salty water. He then attached separate copperwires to the top and the bottom of the pile. When he closed the circuit, acontinuous electric current flowed through the pile. Known as the “VoltaicPile,” Volta's invention was the first battery. In his honor, the designationand measurement of electrical potential is called the volt (symbolized V). Todaywe see batteries of all strengths and purposes designated by their voltage (ornumber of volts), such as a 1.5-V penlight battery or a 13.5-V automotivebattery.Image [images/p021-002.jpg]In 1820, Hans Christian Oersted observed that when an electrical current passingthrough a voltaic pile is either stopped or started near the magnetic needle ofa compass, the needle will be deflected. Here was proof positive of arelationship between electricity and magnetism. It is worth noting that, at thetime of Oersted's observations, electricity began to be used for public lightingin only a limited way. The idea of powering motors or anything else was far inthe future.Building on Coulomb's demonstrations of electric charges repelling one another,as well as Oersted's and Ampere's discoveries that an electric current producesa magnetic field, the British chemist and electrical scientist Michael Faradaywas able to invent the first primitive electrical motor (1831). Just as thelexicon of SI units grew with each new electrical attribution, so Faraday's workresulted in the adoption of the farad (symbolized F) as the base unit forelectrical capacitance. Capacitance defines how much of an electrical field canbe stored in an electrical component. The formula for one farad is:Image [images/p022-001.jpg]Image [images/p022-002.jpg]With the idea that a component can store electrical energy in the form of amagnetic field, Faraday reasoned that the component can also produce electricalenergy. This was the landmark principle of electromagnetic induction. On thebasis of that principle, it would be possible for a dynamo, or generator, toproduce electricity by mechanical means.INDUCTIONIf an electrical current is passed through a coil of wire, the coil will producea magnetic field around it. Similarly, if a magnetic field is introduced to thecoil of wire, the coil will produce an electrical current. In these situations,we can say the coil has been induced, or is an inductor.Little did Tesla know while learning the system of SI units that his ownscientific work would someday lead to a standard unit for magnetic flux density:the tesla (symbolized T). In the meantime, Faraday's electromagnetic inductiontheory had to figure strongly in Tesla's mind as he was finishing his first yearof college. It was a year of sleepless nights, spent studying, driving himselfto achieve the highest grades, and gambling as a way to fit in with otherstudents who considered him an oddball.Nikola returned home for the summer, once again rundown. He wanted to impresshis father with his scholarly achievements, but Milutin was at odds with him forhis bad health and gambling. This type of behavior was completely against hisfather's religious principles.SECOND-YEAR STUDIES—THOUGHTS OF ALTERNATING CURRENTTesla's return to the Polytechnic Institute that fall freed him from hisfather's incessant criticism, as he immersed himself once again in ProfessorPoeschl's physics lectures. An especially exciting moment came with the arrivalof a direct-current Gramme dynamo (an electrical generator that produces directcurrent, or DC, with the use of a commutator) from Paris. The device had thehorseshoe shape of a laminated field magnet and a wire-wound armature with acommutator.COMMUTATORA commutator is a split-ring device that reverses the current in the armaturecoil. By reversing the current at the point of the commutator that was attachedby COPPER BRUSHES to the coil, the torque, or force acting on the DC motor,would remain constant.Image [images/p023-001.jpg]Intriguing as the dynamo was to Tesla, he had doubts that it was efficientlyconstructed. He was quick to point out its shortcomings.The dynamo was connected up and various effects of the currents were shown.While Prof. Poeschl was making demonstrations, running the machine as a motor,the brushes gave trouble, sparking badly, and I observed that it might bepossible to operate a motor without these appliances. But he declared it couldnot be done and did the honor of delivering a lecture on the subject, at theconclusion of which he remarked: “Mr. Tesla may accomplish great things, but hecertainly never will do this. It would be equivalent to converting a steadilypulling force, like that of gravity, into a rotary effort. It is a perpetualmotion scheme, an impossible idea.” We have, undoubtedly, certain finer fibersthat enable us to perceive truths when logical deduction, or any other willfull[sic] effort of the brain, is futile. For a time I wavered, imprest [sic] by theprofessor's authority, but sooner became convinced I was right and undertook thetask with all the fire and boundless confidence of youth. (My Inventions)Professor Poeschl's embarrassing rebuke stung Tesla even more than his ownfather's admonishments. For the next few years, he pondered ways to proveProfessor Poeschl wrong. There had to be a way to deliver alternating currentwithout the use of a commutator and sparking brushes. To Tesla's way ofthinking, a motor was only one part of a system. So he broadened hisperspective. He eventually visualized a total system that included not only themotor, but a generator that would deliver the electricity to power the motor.The invention process would frustrate him for years before such a system wouldcome to be realized.Image [images/p024-001.jpg]COLLEGE DROPOUTPerhaps out of boredom, perhaps because he felt his professors were insensitiveto his ideas about alternating current, Tesla adopted many of the dissolute waysof fellow students. He took to smoking, gambling, playing billiards, anddrinking excessive amounts of coffee to keep pace with the group. His studiesfell off, and he had to drop out of school during what would have been his thirdyear in college.Above all, Nikola did not want to face the wrath of his father. He was adrift.After trekking south to Maribor, near Graz, and taking a short-lived engineeringjob, he practically disappeared. Eventually Milutin was able to get in touchwith him and tried to persuade him to return to the Polytechnic Institute.Failing this, his father urged Tesla to continue his studies at a college inPrague, the Charles-Ferdinand University. Instead, Tesla gambled away hisfather's money. As Tesla later recounted, his mother was more forgiving.She understood the character of men and knew that one's salvation could only bebrought about thru his own efforts. One afternoon, I remember, when I had lostall my money and was craving for a game, she came to me with a roll of bills andsaid, “Go and enjoy yourself. The sooner you lose all we possess the better itwill be. I know that you will get over it.” (My Inventions)The money she gave him quickly disappeared at the gambling tables. Dissolute,his studies aborted, Tesla soon came to recognize that his life would have tochange. Here was another opportunity for him to apply free will, the lesson hehad taught himself at age 12. As hard as it was for him, Tesla returned to thefamily home in Gospić and attempted to resolve the differences with his fatherby attending Milutin's church. As he continued to ponder his future, Nikola alsomade an effort to fit into the local society.At 6 feet, 2 inches tall, he was a striking figure. He had a handsome face andwas well-mannered, though perhaps a bit shy. He did not go unnoticed. In Gospićhe attracted the attention of a young woman named Anna. Tesla espoused love, butthoughts of motors and alternating current were never far from his mind. WithMilutin's death in April 1879, it was time to move on and honor his father'swishes that he complete a college education. Any potential love interest fadedinto the background.Relatives contributed money to further Tesla's education in Prague, but theirsupport was simply not enough to sustain full-time study. He continued to takecourses but never received a degree, remaining a self-taught engineer withextensive language skills.BUDAPEST—PROVING THE POSSIBILITY OF ALTERNATING CURRENTBelieving he could find employment at Alexander Graham Bell's telephone exchangein Budapest, Tesla set out for the Hungarian capital in early 1881.Unfortunately, plans for the Budapest exchange had not yet come to fruition.In desperate need of money, Tesla sought help from relatives, who were able tosecure him a draftsman's job in the Hungarian Central Telegraph Office. But therole was not well-suited to the 24-year-old Serb, who was terrible at drafting.It drove him to a complete nervous breakdown; he believed he was going to die.As he later explained the experience,the period of that illness surpasses all belief. My sight and hearing werealways extraordinary. I could clearly discern objects in the distance whenothers saw no trace of them. Several times in my boyhood I saved the houses ofour neighbors from fire by hearing the faint crackling sounds which did notdisturb their sleep, and calling for help. (My Inventions)It was an excruciating time for him. Any light or sound seemed to pierce hisbody or pound thunderously in his head. His heart would beat rapidly, his entirebody would convulse.To aid in his recovery, a former classmate and engineer named Anthony Szigetiwould accompany Tesla on long walks. Szigeti became an instrumental soundingboard for Tesla's theories. Their walks and talks in the city's parks slowlybrought Tesla back to health, restoring his will to live. His energy renewed,Tesla resumed his mental quest to prove that an alternating current systemwithout commutators or brushes was a viable alternative to motors driven bydirect current. Solely in his mind, without a single piece of apparatus, heconducted experiment after experiment, testing each part down to the millimeter.Given to hyperbole and a prolific writer throughout his life, Tesla recounts hisbreakthrough discovery in dramatic terms in his autobiography. He arrived at therevelation during an afternoon stroll through a Budapest park with his friendSzigeti. As Tesla recited lines from Goethe's Faust from memory, he was struckby an inspirational passage.As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash of lightning andin an instant the truth was revealed. I drew with a stick on the sand thediagrams shown six years later in my address before the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers, and my companion understood them perfectly. The images Isaw were wonderfully sharp and clear and had the solidity of metal and stone, somuch so that I told him: “See my motor here; watch me reverse it.” I cannotbegin to describe my emotions.... A thousand secrets of nature which I mighthave stumbled upon accidentally I would have given for that one which I hadwrestled from her against all odds and at the peril of my existence. (MyInventions)Image [images/p027-001.jpg]What Tesla diagrammed in sand that day would eventually change the course ofhistory. He could now proudly proclaim that he was an inventor. “This was theone thing I wanted to be,” he would write. “Archimedes was my ideal. I admiredthe works of artists, but to my mind, they were only shadows and semblances. Theinventor, I thought, gives to the world creations which are palpable, which liveand work.” Although Tesla's solution certainly disproved Professor Poeschl'sadmonition, it was still only preliminary and hypothetical. The world would haveto wait for conclusive, refined drawings, which accompanied his address to theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York, in May 1888.Image [images/p028-001.jpg]Essentially a motor works through the interaction of two sets of magnets, onestationary (the stator) and one able to move freely (the rotor). Both the statorand rotor are essentially coils of wire around metal cores. Rather than rely onpermanent magnets that weaken over time, a motor utilizes electromagnets.Because electromagnets have no reason to set the rotor spinning, however, thepolarity of the electromagnets has to keep switching in order to keep the motorturning. In early motors, this was accomplished by introducing a split-ringcommutator to supply current to the rotor. Tesla's breakthrough was to removethe commutator and introduce only alternating current to the stator. The resultwas the creation of a magnetic field that opposed the magnetic field on thestator, thereby turning the rotor. Tesla's genius was discovering the perpetualback-and-forth motion that led to the creation of his induction motor.Image [images/p028-002.jpg]PARIS—WORKING FOR THE EDISON ORGANIZATIONWhile buoyed by his breakthrough discovery, Tesla faced the reality of needingan income. With plans for the Budapest telephone exchange now in place, he wasable to join the company in the latter part of 1881. He was a standout in hiswork, making all sorts of calculations and improvements for the variousinstallations, including superior amplification systems. He rose rapidly instature and was promoted by the owner of the central exchange, Ferenc Puskas, tothe position of chief electrician. Tesla's contributions helped make theexchange a viable business, and eventually Puskas was able to sell it for aprofit. Puskas in turn recommended Tesla and Szigeti to his brother, TivadorPuskas, who was introducing incandescent lighting systems for Continental Edisonin Paris.Here was just the opportunity Tesla had been waiting for. It would be a chanceto meet the Edison people and introduce them to the rotating magnetic field. Heaccepted the position immediately and went to work for Continental Edison inParis in 1882.Living in Paris, Tesla stuck to a rigid daily schedule, rising before sunriseevery morning, swimming in the Seine regardless of weather, and walking an hourto the company's factory in the suburb of Ivry. But there were many distractionsin the beguiling City of Light. In the evenings he would play billiards withcompany colleagues, often discussing his electrical theories. He dined in someof the city's finest restaurants and soaked up Parisian culture in all itsfinery. Before the end of every month, he had spent most of his money. When Mr.Puskas asked him how he was getting along, Tesla replied, “The last twenty-ninedays of the month are the toughest!”Never far from his mind was a steady stream of mental calculations on how hisdiscovery of the rotating magnetic field could solve many of the problemsassociated with the Edison system. The equipment was built or repaired largelyon the basis of methods handed down by one employee or another, sometimesthrough much trial and error. The workers were not trained in physics orengineering; nor did they possess Tesla's knowledge of mathematics. When hewould try to explain a problem from his perspective, no one was interested. Thiswas a big disappointment for Tesla, as the company was more interested in theprofits to be derived from spreading incandescent lighting than in electricalpower motors.Nevertheless, Tesla continued to observe how the various dynamos and motors werephysically assembled and functioned at the plant. As was often the case, hewrestled with the theoretical configurations but did not physically assemble theequipment. With his vast mathematical and engineering knowledge, he was able toextrapolate formulas that would vastly improve the construction of the machines.All his talk of inventions at Continental Edison was wasted until it caught theear of a Mr. D. Cunningham, foreman of the Mechanical Department, who offered toform a stock company. “The proposal seemed to me comical in the extreme,” Teslalater wrote. “I did not have the faintest conception of what that meant exceptthat it was an American way of doing things.”Indeed nothing came of the proposal. Tesla thereafter shuttled back and forthbetween constituent Edison companies in France and Germany, repairing equipmentat the various power plants. During one of his return trips to Paris, a companyadministrator named Mr. Rau offered Tesla the opportunity to improve the methodfor regulating current on its dynamo electric machines. He reveled in the taskof developing automatic regulators for the dynamos (PATENT 336,961 – REGULATORFOR DYNAMO-ELECTRIC MACHINES, filed May 18, 1885, following Tesla's arrival inthe United States).Although his invention did not dispense with commutators and brushes, Tesla'ssolution was so successful that the Edison Company entrusted him to solve amajor problem with a lighting installation at the railroad station inStrasbourg, Germany, in 1883. As he explained the situation, “The wiring wasdefective and on the occasion of the opening ceremonies a large part of a wallwas blown out thru a short-circuit right in the presence of Old Emperor WilliamI. The German Government refused to take the plant and the French Company wasfacing a serious loss.”Tesla labored day and night to fix the system. His technical knowledge, workexperience, and ability to speak German made him the right man for the job. Yetfixing the problem at the train station was hardly the greatest success in hisown mind during his stay in Strasbourg. During his spare time there, heconstructed his first alternating-current motor out of materials he brought fromParis, along with a disk of iron and bearings made for him in a local mechanicalshop. “It was a crude apparatus,” he remarked. “The consummation of theexperiment was, however, delayed until the summer of that year when I finallyhad the satisfaction of seeing rotation effected by alternating currents ofdifferent phase, and without sliding contacts or commutators, all as I hadconceived a year before.”PHASEA phase is a property of waves. In its purest form, AC is represented by a sinewave. The sine wave has peaks and valleys, with a zero-crossing between them. Aphase of the AC sine wave is the distance, or period, between the firstzero-crossing and the point in space where the wave originated.Eventually Tesla would formulate theories for polyphase (multiphase) systemsthat would generate power by utilizing alternating voltages of the samefrequency, in which the phases are cyclically displaced by fractions of aperiod.Image [images/p031-001.jpg]Tesla met a number of influential people while in Strasbourg and solicited themfor capital for his new invention. Disappointed, he returned to Paris in early1884 in the hope of at least some reward from Continental Edison for hissuccesses in Strasbourg. Once again he faced disillusionment, as he was shuttledfrom one manager to another without receiving the payment he thought had beenpromised. His requests to demonstrate his alternating-current system and newmotor met with disapproval as well, so the independent-minded young inventorquit the French Edison company.Image [images/p031-002.jpg]Fortunately for him, a company administrator named Charles Batchelor—also apersonal friend of Thomas A. Edison—urged Tesla to go to the United States andwork for the firm on the design and manufacturing of dynamos and motors.Batchelor gave Tesla a personal letter of recommendation to Mr. Edison himself.OFF TO AMERICAFollowing Batchelor's suggestion, Nikola Tesla set out on his journey in spring1884. He sold all of his possessions except for a few essential personal effectsand used the money to buy a train ticket to the docks, where he was booked fortransatlantic passage on the S.S. Saturnia.He arrived at the station just as the train was pulling out, only to discoverthat his tickets and money were missing. Racing alongside the train, he jumpedaboard at the last possible moment. With the few coins remaining in his pocket,he managed to pay the conductor for his ticket.At the docks, Tesla explained his plight to skeptical steamship officials andwas permitted to embark only when no one else showed up to claim hisreservation. With the remnants of his belongings, a few poems and articles hehad written, and a package of calculations for a problem related to flyingmachines, Tesla began his journey. He spent most of the trip in solitude at thestern of the ship, mind abuzz with thoughts of alternating current and hisinduction motor. He was off to the land of promise.Image [images/p032-001.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3THE PHOENIX RISESThe scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect thathis advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of theplanter—for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are tocome, and point the way.—Nikola TeslaImage [images/p033-001.jpg]TESLA ARRIVED IN NEW YORK IN JUNE 1884 with four cents in his pocket, and theAmerica he encountered seemed rough, crude, and a century behind Europe. Thepolice were curt when he asked for directions. Cab fare was more than fourcents, so he started walking. When he encountered a man in front of his shopkicking a machine, Tesla volunteered to fix it and was handsomely rewarded witha twenty-dollar bill.WORKING FOR THE WIZARDNikola Tesla's working life in America was to begin the next day. With hisletter of recommendation in hand, he was off to meet the great Thomas A. Edison.Batchelor's introduction read as follows: “I know two great men and you are onethem; the other is this young man [Tesla].”Image [images/p034-001.jpg]Tesla was thrilled at first to be working for the famous American inventor. Butthe 28-year-old Tesla and 37-year-old Wizard of Menlo Park were a contrast instyles. Tesla brought with him courtly Old World manners and refined Europeandress. He was fluent in English, well-read, full of hygienic phobias, andanxious to learn as much as he could about American customs. Edison, bycontrast, was often gruff, dressed in plain home-made clothes, and spent theworkday in a workman's lab coat. He was a boastful propagandist and would letlittle stand in his way.Image [images/p034-002.jpg]A brilliant inventor and innovator, Edison was an aggressive businessman whobuilt profitable commercial enterprises through guile, cunning, and a focus onprofits. He supplied direct-current electricity for lighting some of the mostopulent mansions of Lower Manhattan, as well as certain factories, theaters, andpublic venues around the city. His empire consisted of the Edison Machine Workson Goerck Street downtown and the Edison Electric Light Company on Fifth Avenue.His generating station at 255-57 Pearl Street served the entire Wall Street andEast River area. He did his most important research at a laboratory at MenloPark, New Jersey, and later West Orange, New Jersey.Virtually from the moment Tesla stepped into Edison's domain, the company wasbeset by crises. Fires resulting from faulty electrical wiring threatened themansions lighted by Edison Electric. The S.S. Oregon, the first ocean liner withelectric lighting, was delayed at the docks and losing money by the hour becauseits dynamos were unable to generate power. Edison, eager to expedite repairs soas not to jeopardize ties with his major financial backer, J. Pierpont Morgan,promptly dispatched his newly arrived assistant to make the necessary repairs.Tesla later recounted:In the evening I took the necessary instruments with me and went aboard thevessel where I stayed the night. The dynamos were in bad condition, havingseveral short-circuits and breaks, but with the assistance of the crew Isucceeded in putting them in good shape. At five o'clock in the morning, whenpassing along Fifth Avenue on my way to the shop I met Edison with Batchellor .. . returning home to retire. “Here is our Parisian running around at night,” hesaid. When I told him that I was coming from the Oregon and had repaired bothmachines, he looked at me in silence and walked away without another word. Butwhen he had gone some distance I heard him remark: “Batchellor, this is a d—ngood man,” and from that time on I had full freedom in directing work. (MyInventions)With a promise of $50,000 for designing improved dynamos, Tesla worked on theproject every day, seven days a week, until completing the task. When he went tohis boss to report his success and claim his payment, Edison dismissed him witha laugh and curt reply, “You don't understand our American humor.”Image [images/p035-001.jpg]Nor did Tesla ever have the chance to present his alternating-current theoriesor demonstrate his induction motor to Edison. His every request fell on deafears. Edison was heavily invested in delivering direct current to his profitableline of arc-lighting systems. Although Tesla would work for Edison for only sixmonths, their strained relationship would have far-reaching repercussions in the20th century.AFTER EDISONWith the sting of Edison's rebuke fresh in his ears, Tesla knew he needed topress forward with greater resolve. His time working with Edison enabled him toobserve the genius close at hand, but Tesla would challenge his theories andwage a war of words with Edison for years to come. In one newspaper article, hewrote:His [Thomas Edison's] method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immenseground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervenedand, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just alittle theory and calculation would have saved him 90 per cent of the labor. Buthe had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge,trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical Americansense. In view of this, the truly prodigious amount of his actualaccomplishments is little short of a miracle.Bolstered with confidence after his experience with Edison, Tesla set out toorganize his own notebooks on advanced arc lighting and the construction ofcommutators. He reasoned that this would be a valuable first step in advancinghis own ideas on alternating current. A scheme took shape.Tesla was a man of strong opinion and well-formulated ideas. He could visualizethe structure of an electrical machine down to the tiniest wire. While workingat Edison Machine Works, he also developed a reputation for hard work andinnovative problem-solving. That reputation spread beyond the offices of theEdison plant and enabled him to gain access to individuals who might further hisplans.Perhaps it had not occurred to Tesla immediately that he should apply for designpatents. In his case, as for other inventors, to patent a process or design doesnot necessarily require physical creation. One example would be the developmentof patent leather. This invention was left to Seth Boyden, who in 1888 madehard, shiny leather for the manufacturing of boots in Newark, New Jersey. Whenasked why he didn't request a patent for patent leather, Boyden said, “Iintroduced patent leather, but it should be remembered that there was nothinggenerous or liberal in its introduction, as I served myself first, and when itsnovelty had ceased and I had other objects in view, it was a natural course toleave it.” Though he did not seek fame or fortune for his invention, Boyden wasgreatly respected in his own lifetime. He lived out his remaining years in ahouse in Maplewood (then called Hilton), New Jersey, that had been donated tohim by grateful industrialists. In 1926, an admiring Thomas Edison said ofBoyden, “He was one of America's greatest inventors.... His many great andpractical inventions have been the basis for great industries which giveemployment to millions of people.” Seth Boyden—not Tesla—was the man Edisonnamed as the second-greatest inventor in American history, after himself.Image [images/p037-001.jpg]Image [images/p037-002.jpg]TESLA ELECTRIC LIGHT AND MANUFACTURING COMPANYSoon after he resigned from the Edison organization in 1885, fortune smiled onTesla. He was approached by two New Jersey residents, Benjamin A. Vail, alawyer, and Robert Lane, a businessman, who were both excited about theprospects for electric lighting and wanted a piece of the pie. Their plan was toenlist Tesla in a new business enterprise called the Tesla Electric Light andManufacturing Company. They would join a burgeoning field to make and distributearc-lighting equipment across the country.ARC LIGHTINGLighting is produced when an arc of electricity jumps between two chargedconductors. In the case of a light bulb the conductors are connected by atightly wound tungsten filament that glows between the conductors, thus emittinglight from the bulb.Vail and Lane made Tesla a partner and issued him stock in the company. Buoyedby his newfound status and position, Tesla set to work on improving his designsfor manufacturing arc-lighting equipment, generators to power the equipment, andregulators to control the amount of electricity flowing to the equipment. Hisimprovements resulted in more efficient methods to deliver light, with lessenergy loss and reduced overheating.Now it was the moment for Tesla to protect his ideas by patenting them. He wouldhave something to show for his work beside his physical exertion. According tobiographer Marc J. Seifer, Tesla met in March 1885 with the noted patentattorney Lemuel Serrell, a former agent of Edison's, and Serrell's patentartist, named Raphael Netter. Over the next several months, Serrell and Netterfiled a series of patents that were assigned to the Tesla Electric Light andManufacturing Company in return for stock shares in the company. The initial setof patents reflected major improvements in the components of the arc-lightingprocess. PATENT 335,786 – ELECTRIC-ARC LAMP was the first of some 300 patentsTesla filed in his lifetime.PATENT HISTORYA patent is an exclusive right granted by a government to protect the owner ofan idea to manufacture, use, or sell an invention for a certain number of years.A written application with a detailed description and attendant drawings isfiled with the United States Government Patent and Trademark Office. Onceapproved, the inventor's rights are protected. Currently this protection is for21 years.In telling fashion, Tesla clung to his European roots in filing the officialdocument with the United States Government, beginning the application asfollows:To all whom it may concern:Be it known that I, NIKOLA TESLA, of Smiljan Lika,border country of Austria-Hungary, have invented . . .It would not be until 1891, when he became a naturalized U.S. citizen, thatTesla would exclude the name of his homeland from his patent applications.It was Tesla's hope that once he filed the patents and demonstrated realimprovements in the arc-lighting system, he would be able to win the support ofVail and Lane for his AC motor system. But whenever he broached the subject, histwo partners strung him along. Like Edison before them, Vail and Lane wereentrepreneurs. They already had a system that worked well and, they believed,optimized their profits. Arc lighting was the talk of Rahway, NJ, where theirsystem illuminated the town's streets and factories. Vail and Lane were not theleast bit interested in branching out into another untested project.Image [images/p039-001.jpg]Once Tesla assigned the patents to Tesla Electric Light and ManufacturingCompany, the two partners saw no further need to employ their inventor. So theydisbanded the company and opened a new one to distribute lighting to the growingcity of Rahway. As Tesla recounted it, “In 1886 my system of arc lighting wasperfected and adopted for factory and municipal lighting, and I was free, butwith no other possession than a beautifully engraved certificate of stock ofhypothetical value.”Image [images/p040-001.jpg]The later part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century were wildtimes for inventors, investors, and individuals with business acumen who soughtto protect major technological innovations by filing for patents. Great stridesin transportation, the transmission of energy, industrial processes, domesticconvenience, and home entertainment were spreading across the United States witha rapid rate. Edison had invented the phonograph in 1877 and, with Louis HowardLatimer, he would invent the first long-lasting incandescent light bulb in 1879.Soon to come were the invention of the airplane by Orville and Wilbur Wright in1903, the Model T by Henry Ford in 1908, and the large-scale moving assemblyline in 1913.Image [images/p040-002.jpg]LOUIS HOWARD LATIMER (1848-1928)An expert electrical engineer, Latimer did work for Edison that proved criticalto the company's success. His knowledge of electric lighting and power guidedEdison through the process of filing patent forms properly at the U.S. PatentOffice, protecting the company from infringements of his inventions. Latimer wasalso in charge of the company library, collecting information from around theworld and translating data from French and German to protect the company fromEuropean challenges. He became Edison's patent investigator and expert witnessin cases against persons trying to benefit from Edison's inventions withoutlegal permission.Edison encouraged Latimer to write his popular book, INCANDESCENT ELECTRICLIGHTING: A PRACTICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE EDISON SYSTEM (1890), which explainedhow an incandescent lamp produces light in an easy-to-understand manner. OnFebruary 11, 1918, Latimer became one of the 28 charter members of the EdisonPioneers, the only African American in this prestigious group.Image [images/p041-001.jpg]DOWN IN THE DITCHESTesla's AC power system would eventually fit neatly into the excitement of theIndustrial Revolution and have as great an impact as any of its otherinventions. Tesla's arrival in New York in June 1884 came barely a year afterthe opening of the Brooklyn Bridge, providing road and rail access betweenBrooklyn and Manhattan. Unlike John and Emily Roebling's “Great Bridge,”however, Tesla's flights of fantasy regarding the production, purchase,transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity for residential, commercial,and industrial purposes too often remained brilliant ideas rather than becomingrealities.For all his dreaming, Tesla's concept of an AC power system still had not beendeveloped. And after being abandoned by Vail and Lane, the inventor needed a wayto support himself. Now, instead of a laboratory, he found himself literallydigging ditches in New York City. The Brooklyn Bridge loomed within hissightlines, glowing after sunset with 70 arc lamps operated by anothercompetitor, the United States Illuminating Company.Image [images/p042-001.jpg]The Brooklyn Bridge was the longest suspension span ever built to that time, atestament to modern engineering, entrepreneurial ingenuity, and business acumen.These were three lessons that Tesla had not yet fully grasped. While innovationsin electrical engineering still reverberated in his mind, the great practicalquestions were left unanswered.What would he need to do in order to convince investors that his ideas wereviable? Would Tesla's AC system render all the time, energy, and significantinvestments in developing, manufacturing, and distribution of electricity viathe DC system obsolete? Would he be able to prove that his system would generatelarge profits? Would the system prove safe? Would it require the circusmentality of P.T. Barnum, who took 21 elephants across the bridge in May 1884,to demonstrate the superiority of AC?In the meantime, he continued to dig ditches. His savoir faire (sophistication,correct behavior, adaptability) and his ability to speak many languages,including French, did him little good with a shovel in his hand. Nor did hislack of business savvy help the situation. Here he was at the age of 30, bywhich time many men were well-established in their careers. Tesla had come toAmerica with great hope and promise, but success now seemed farther off thanever and he was plagued by material want, utterly depressed. “My high educationin various branches of science, mechanics, and literature,” he would laterwrite, “were a mockery.”TESLA ELECTRIC COMPANYWith little to show for his efforts other than dirty hands, worthless stockcertificates, and copies of patents assigned to other parties, there still hadto be a way for him to climb out of the hole. One possibility might be to file apatent in his own name. As in the case of the arc-lamp application, however, thedetailed description and diagram could not be dashed off so easily. Theapplication had to be specific to prevent anyone from infringing on the patent.Filing the paperwork was often a long, arduous process, drawing the inventorinto an extended love/hate relationship with the patent office. And there wasnot even a guarantee that the patent would be granted. How Nikola Tesla had thelegal knowledge, skill, and patience to file successfully for PATENT 396,121 –THERMO-MAGNETIC MOTOR, 1886, remains a mystery and a credit to hisresourcefulness to the present day.Although a strong knowledge of electrical engineering is necessary to thoroughlyunderstand many of Tesla's patents, at the heart of this electromagnetism patentis the simple “Right-Hand Rule” of physics as observed by Michael Faraday (1831)in presenting his theory of electromagnetic induction theory. The diagrams belowillustrate the Right-Hand Rule.In the diagram below, imagine a conducting rod placed perpendicular across theindex finger with a current flowing through it in the direction of InducedCurrent I. When a current (in the direction indicated) passes through this rodor the rod in the right picture, a magnetic field radiates out from them.Starting and stopping the flow of current changes the magnetic field—a keyprinciple of Tesla's work on motors.Image [images/p043-001.jpg]Tesla knew that magnets lose their magnetic strength when heated. To demonstratethis phenomenon, he describes a small motor in his patent application for thethermo-magnetic motor. The motor consists of a fixed magnet (N), an ironpivoting arm (P) with a moving magnet (A) attached to it, a leaf spring (FM), aBunsen burner (H), and a flywheel. At normal temperature, the fixed magnet isstrong enough to pull the pivot arm and compress the spring. But when the pivotarm is pulled toward the fixed magnet, it passes across the flame of the Bunsenburner. The flame heats the pivot arm and causes it to lose the magnetisminduced by the fixed magnet. The force of the compressed spring is now greaterthan the force of the magnetic field, causing the pivot arm to swing away fromthe fixed magnet. Because the pivot arm is connected by a crank to the flywheel,the motion of the pivot arm causes the flywheel to turn. As the pivot arm swingsout of the flame, it cools off and is attracted once again to the magnet. Nowthe strength of the magnetic field is greater than the force of the spring,causing the pivot arm to swing back toward the fixed magnet and the flame. Inshort, Tesla's patent application outlined the basic principle of the motor.Beyond that, it was instrumental in opening the door to his development of theAC motor.Image [images/p044-001.jpg]What may have sounded like the ramblings of a mad man digging ditches—talk oflost patents, a lost company, lost inventions, and the genius of hisalternating-current system—caught the ear of Tesla's foreman, who introduced himto Alfred S. Brown, a prominent engineer for the Western Union TelegraphCompany. Brown himself held a number of patents on arc lamps and was well awareof the limitations of the prevailing DC apparatus. He was immediately impressedwith Tesla's ideas and contacted a “distinguished lawyer” from Englewood, NewJersey, named Charles F. Peck.Brown and Peck were well-versed in business, corporate takeovers, and thelawsuits being filed among the various telegraph companies spreading across theUnited States. Their experience and practical knowledge in exploitingtechnological innovation made them ideal partners for Tesla. In Tesla,conversely, Brown and Peck appeared to have found the perfect partner to exploitthe new technology.Peck, however, remained skeptical. He knew that others had failed in creating aviable AC system and did not even want to see a demonstration. In attempting towin his support, Tesla recalled the tale of Christopher Columbus in seeking anaudience with the queen of Spain to fund his exploration. In order to do so, hewagered courtiers that he could stand an egg on end. The crowd gathered aroundand tried in vain. It tried some more and failed. Finally Columbus stepped in,cracked the egg gently on one end, and stood it on the flat surface. He won thebet and secured the necessary funding from Queen Isabella.Image [images/p045-001.jpg]Tesla repeated the experiment for Peck, who did not immediately see theconnection between Columbus's Egg and Tesla's boasts of creating athermo-magnetic device, a key element of the AC electrical system. Shrewdly,Tesla challenged Peck to provide funding if he could do better than Columbus andmake the egg stand without even cracking the egg. Peck agreed.Tesla wasted no time over the next few days, enlisting the help of a blacksmithto cast a hard-boiled egg out of copper and brass, and fastening his four-coilmagnet to the underside of a wooden table. When he reconvened with Peck andBrown, Tesla placed the copper egg on the top of the table and applied twoout-of-phase (or alternating) currents to the magnet. To their astonishment, theegg stood on end. They were even more stupefied when the egg and four brassballs started spinning by themselves on the tabletop. While it looked likemagic, Tesla explained, the egg and balls were spinning because of the rotatingmagnetic field. Peck and Brown were duly impressed by this demonstration andbecame ardent supporters of Tesla's work on AC motors.Tesla, for his part, learned two lessons from these demonstrations. First, it iseasier to convince someone if they see something with their own eyes. Second,the hardest part is being brave enough to try something new. Showmanship becamean integral part of many of Tesla's successes in the future.Together, Brown and Peck raised the capital and provided the technical expertiseto set up Tesla in a laboratory. The facility was located at 89 Liberty Streetin Lower Manhattan, next to the grounds on which the World Trade Center wouldlater be built. A partnership with Tesla was formed, and the new company wascalled the Tesla Electric Company.Under the requirements of the U.S. Patent Office, a single all-inclusive patentcould not cover the entire AC system. The system would have to be broken downinto separate groups or components, with individual patents filed for eachinvention in a particular group. Beginning on April 30, 1887, and over thecourse of the next year, the Tesla Electric Company engaged in feverish patentfiling for an AC dynamo and other devices that comprised Tesla's AC system.Because his inventions were so new and unique in the burgeoning field ofelectrical science, they encountered little difficulty in gaining approval. Thechart below lists some of the company's key early patents. Repeat titles reflectimprovements made in successive filings.Image [images/p046-001.jpg]Tesla worked relentlessly, often going without sleep. From memory, he was ableto reproduce machines he had conceived more than five years earlier in Europe.He designed and produced complete systems of alternating-current machinery:single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase. For each system, he conceived thedynamo for generating currents, the motor for producing power from them, and thetransformers for raising and reducing the voltages, as well as a variety ofdevices for automatically controlling the machinery—including the mathematicaltheories for all the components.TESLA'S POLYPHASE SYSTEMPolyphase means multiple currents, each out of phase, or out of step, with oneanother. Think of a bicycle. When the rider pushes down on one pedal, the otherpedal crests at the top and starts to push down, powering the bicycle forward.Similarly, in out-of-phase AC current, there is always one cycle nearing itspeak, pushing the current forward.Nikola Tesla had finally arrived. His patent work in 1887–1888 marked thebeginning of a remarkable 15-year run in the field of invention.Peck and Brown, for their part, developed an astute business strategy, seekingsupport and endorsements from eminent electrical engineering professionals. Mostnotably, George Westinghouse, another daring young electrical pioneer and apractical business man, would open his door to back Tesla financially. Thusbegan the “The War of the Currents” between Tesla's AC system and Edison's DCsystem.Image [images/p047-001.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4SOARINGImage [images/p049-001.jpg]ON OCTOBER 28, 1886, President Grover Cleveland officiated at the dedication ofFrederic Auguste Bartholdi's great statue, “Liberty Enlightening the World”—nowwidely known as the Statue of Liberty—in New York Harbor. Not far away in LowerManhattan, Tesla's Liberty Street lab soon became a hotbed of design, patentapplications, and the construction of various AC induction motors. It was workthat would keep Tesla awake around the clock for days on end.In May 1887, Tesla recruited his old friend and associate from Budapest, AnthonySzigeti (who had witnessed Tesla's early sand drawings of an induction motoralmost five years earlier) to assist with production. As his ship sailed pastthe outstretched torch of Lady Liberty, Szigeti's grandest dreams of successcould hardly have anticipated what lay ahead. Along with engineer Alfred Brown,who provided technical input, Tesla and Szigeti would forge an alliance to freethe world from the constraints of DC.Image [images/p049-002.jpg]Now that funds were raised for research and development, it was an opportunetime to bring Tesla's induction motor to the attention of the electricalengineering establishment. First, Peck and Brown would need to vet the machinewith a prominent electrical engineer and physicist before they could realize anyprofit. They found the right person in Professor William A. Anthony of CornellUniversity, who subjected two motors—one AC, one DC—to intense scrutiny.According to Professor Anthony's report, the efficiency of Tesla's AC motor wasequal to that of the best DC motor.Second, Peck and Brown were anxious to reach out to the electrical communityat-large. With Professor Anthony's glowing review, it was easy to attract theattention of Thomas Commerford Martin, the editor of America's premierelectrical magazine, Electrical World, as well as president of the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineering (AIEE). His endorsement would be key toTesla's success in America.THOMAS COMMEFORD MARTIN AND THE AIEE LECTUREAfter a demonstration of Tesla's apparatus at the Liberty Street lab, Martinsuggested that Tesla prepare a lecture for other noted electricians. Teslarefused at first, but when his first seven patents were granted on May 1, 1888,Martin approached him again.An Englishman educated as a theologian, Martin came to the United States withOld World manners and a close familiarity with the spread of electricity. He hadstood beside his father in the laying of the first telegraph cable under theAtlantic Ocean with British physicist Lord Kelvin and others. Martin was thesame age as Tesla and shared a common interest in electrical research. Upon hisarrival in New York in 1877 he, too, had gone to work for Edison.Image [images/p050-001.jpg]After the demonstration at Liberty Street, Martin was convinced that Tesla'sinventions in the utilization of polyphase currents would show how thoroughlythe inventor had mastered the fundamental concept and could apply it in thegreatest variety of ways. Martin persisted in asking Tesla to deliver a lectureto the community of electrical engineers, knowing it would prove that motors nolonger required brushes and commutators.Despite being overworked and in poor health, Tesla succumbed to Martin'spersuasive powers (so much so, in fact, that he eventually gave Martin approvalto re-publish all of his papers that had been read before technical societies inthe United States and Europe over the next decade). Overnight he wrote out hisAIEE lecture in longhand. The following day, May 16, 1888, at Columbia College,he delivered his milestone paper, “A New System of Alternate Current Motors andTransformers.”Imagine the setting: Tesla, dressed impeccably as always, standing tall over twomotors set up for demonstration. He speaks perfect English, perhaps with aslight accent (there is no known recording of his voice). Gathered before himsits an assemblage of skeptical, starch-collared electrical engineers. Ifarchival pictures from the period are any indication, they are a formidable lot.Tesla addressed them as follows:The subject which I now have the pleasure of bringing to your notice is a novelsystem of electric distribution and transmission of power by means ofalternating currents, affording peculiar advantages, particularly in the way ofmotors, which I am confident will at once establish the superior adaptability ofthese currents to the transmission of power and will show that many resultsheretofore unattainable can be reached by their use; results which are very muchdesired in the practical operation of such systems, and which cannot beaccomplished by means of continuous currents.Image [images/p051-001.jpg]Tesla went on to explain that commutators are useless in a motor because theyunnecessarily reverse electrical currents. He supported his presentation with aseries of diagrams detailing the step-by-step, back-and-forth magnetic flow ofelectricity in his Electro-Magnetic Motor. The patent for it, Number 381,968,had been approved just two weeks prior to the lecture.Image [images/p052-001.jpg]It was a convincing demonstration of how two alternating currents can create arotating magnetic field and, alternatively, how the rotating magnetic fieldexerts a uniform pull on the motor's rotor. To be sure, he backed up thedemonstration with a full mathematical analysis of how all this wasaccomplished. He then described a basic polyphase motor, which consisted of aring with four separate coils for the stator (which remains fixed with respectto rotating parts) and the steel disc rotor. So clear and persuasive was Tesla'slecture that the engineering community was able to absorb the new principles asif they knew his theories all along.As is often the case with any invention or new theory, however, there is alwayssomeone else who claims to have had the idea first or who refuses to let go ofestablished ways of thinking. Tesla's challengers were at the ready, poised tonip away when the floor was opened to discussion.Professor Elihu Thomson, a prominent electrical engineer and inventor, took thebait. He stood up to make the case against the polyphase motor. Tesla, no one'spushover, responded in a courtly manner by emphasizing the unnecessary use ofcommutators. Thompson was incensed and remained forever at odds with NikolaTesla.While the exchange demonstrated the high degree of competitiveness amongelectrical engineers and inventors, it served Peck, Brown, and Tesla's desiredpurpose. The effect was to set the electrical community abuzz, opening the doorfor the third component of their business strategy: to sell or license thepatents.ENTER GEORGE WESTINGHOUSEWith guile, shrewdness, subterfuge, or smoke and mirrors—call it what youwill—Peck and Brown were determined to get the best deal possible for Tesla'sinvention. Certainly there were profiteers who recognized the potential ofowning Tesla's patents. Controlling the distribution of electrical power wasirresistible to egomaniacal entrepreneurs, as exemplified by Edison's quest tocorner the market on direct current. The rush to control the flow of electricityto homes and factories was in full-throttle. Tesla's system changed the wholeplaying field.George Westinghouse, an industrialist and inventor, had earned a fortune fromhis invention of railroad air brakes (patented 1869). So successful was thisinvention that the Railroad Safety Appliance Act of 1893 made air brakescompulsory on all American trains; they also became standard in Europe.Westinghouse also pursued the development of electronic railroad signalingdevices and standardization across all railway systems.Image [images/p053-001.jpg]For many successful inventors, including Edison, groundbreaking work ispredicated on the achievements of others. As George Westinghouse built hisempire, he purchased a number of devices and patents from Granville T. Woods,who had filed over 50 patents in his own right but lacked the business savvy orsocial standing to make the most of them.GRANVILLE T. WOODS(1856-1910)A free black from Ohio, Woods was a self-educated civil and electrical engineerwhose inventions significantly enhanced the electrical and communication systemsin the railway industry.One of his patents was for a mechanism he called a “telegraphony,” a combinationtelegraph and telephone that could transmit both oral and signal messages. Woodscame to be known as the “Black Edison” after successfully defeating Edison'spatent challenges.Image [images/p054-001.jpg]Westinghouse was no stranger to alternating current and recognized itspotential. He had acquired the patents to an early AC distribution systempioneered by the French scientist Lucien Gaulard and English engineer John DixonGibbs. With Gaulard-Gibbs transformers and a Siemens AC generator, Westinghousesought to install an electrical system for the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Getting such a system up and running posed enormous challenges. In 1886, heincorporated the Westinghouse Electric Company in direct opposition to Edison'sDC system; three years later, he renamed his firm the Westinghouse Electric &Manufacturing Company.Tesla's AIEE speech captured the attention of George Westinghouse, who directedhis staff of engineers to investigate Tesla's motors. Rather than have them tryto copy or modify his design, Westinghouse began negotiating with Peck and Brownfor the patent rights to Tesla's motor and AC system. He was firm in hisconviction that the future lay not only in AC lighting but in AC motors andtransformers that could step up and step down the voltage as required.Westinghouse was ready to invest—and heavily—in Tesla's technology. For starts,he had his scientific associates and legal team trying to corner the market onTesla's motor and patents.Image [images/p055-001.jpg]After weeks of negotiation, Peck, Brown, and Tesla were able to secure afavorable deal with Westinghouse for the motor patents. The industrialist agreedto pay $20,000 in cash and $50,000 in Westinghouse stock, plus a $2.50 royaltyper horsepower on every Tesla motor; there would be a $5,000 minimum royaltypayment in the first year, $10,000 the second year, and $15,000 the third year.Commenting on the deal, Westinghouse said,With reference to the Tesla motor patents, the price to be paid seems ratherhigh when coupled with all of the other terms and conditions, but if it is theonly practicable method for operating a motor by the alternating current, and ifit is applicable to street car work, we can unquestionably easily get from theusers of the apparatus whatever tax is put upon it by the inventors.Tesla had great respect for Westinghouse, who, after all, believed in the ACsystem. With characteristic munificence, Tesla was willing to divide proceeds ofthe sale, retaining four-ninths for himself while granting five-ninths to Peckand Brown for their efforts.That summer, Tesla moved to Pittsburgh to help at the Westinghouse plant withthe development of motors and the city's power system. With his newfound cashflow, Tesla began his life-long residency in hotels. It was a lifestyle thatbefitted his status, wealth, temperament, and permanent bachelor status. Histrusted friend and assistant Szigeti remained behind to test out new machines inthe Liberty Street lab.Image [images/p056-001.jpg]Not all of his colleagues at Westinghouse were entirely receptive to Tesla'sradical new system. They had long run their motors at 133 cycles per second andresisted Tesla's proposal to run on a frequency of only 60 cycles per second. Itwas a frustrating period for him, as he wasted valuable time trying to adaptWestinghouse's motors to his proposed frequency. It prevented Tesla from newresearch for months on end before the Westinghouse staff finally accepted hisproposal to run at the lower frequency and make their motors practical. Sixtycycles per second, or 60 Hertz (written as 60 Hz), remains standard to thepresent today.In late summer 1889, after a year in Pittsburgh, Tesla returned to New York fora short stay, primarily to set up his second lab at 175 Grand Street. ThatSeptember, he went to see the recently unveiled Eiffel Tower at the Paris WorldExposition, to lecture in Europe, and to visit his family in Serbia.AC VS. DC: “WAR OF THE CURRENTS”By acquiring the Tesla AC motor, Westinghouse was positioning himself forsuccess on a large scale. Edison was rightly nervous that this posed a majorthreat to his business built on DC. The result was the so-called War of theCurrents. Edison fired the first salvo by initiating a propaganda battle, citingsafety concerns over the high voltage utilized in AC systems. Demonstrationswere organized to dissuade users from adopting alternating current over Edison'stried-and-true direct current. Edison would not hold back in trying to protecthis technology and his profits, going so far as to suggest that electricity—ACin particular—kills. He had invested enormous sums of money to build DCgenerating stations and networks of copper wire every few city blocks, coveringabout a half-mile, to deliver electricity underground. By 1890, however, thatdistance paled by comparison to Westinghouse's installation of a 12-mile,4000-volt AC transmission line from Willamette Falls to Portland, Oregon.Image [images/p057-001.jpg]Enter Harold P. Brown, a New York engineer and electrical consultant whoendeared himself to Edison's cause by publishing articles on the dubious meritsof AC. Brown went so far as to offer 25 cents for every dog and cat rounded upfor public electrocution by being wired to an AC generating motor. Thedemonstrations would start by wiring a dog to a DC generator and slowly raisingthe voltage, from a low point that caused the dog mild annoyance to a highpoint, close to 700 volts, at which the animal broke loose from the wirerestraints. The upper level was not enough to kill the dog but still tortuous,and onlookers denounced the exercise. Brown used that moment to further hisanti-AC crusade, arguing that that he could put the dog out of its misery byswitching to alternating current. As he demonstrated on stage, a quick jolt of300-volts of AC brought about the quick death of the dog. Had the initial DCcharges so thoroughly weakened the animal that it only took the final AC charge?In reality the demonstration did not prove that AC was any more lethal than DC,but it strengthened that perception and helped affirm Edison's position in thepublic's eye.Although it is not completely clear what motivated Brown to electrocute dogs andcats, we do know that he was employed by Edison and that he was seeking a morehumane method of executing violent criminals. Edison himself later attendedhearings that spurred the New York State Legislature to adopt the electric chairfor capital punishment. Westinghouse was outraged, regarding the campaign aspart of the propaganda war against AC.With Edison's endorsement, Brown was appointed as New York's electrocutionexpert and wasted little time in having a Westinghouse generator installed atAuburn State Prison. The first legal execution by electrocution took place thereon August 6, 1890, with Brown in attendance. The execution did not go at allsmoothly. After a succession of clumsy attempts, convicted murderer WilliamKemmler finally succumbed to increased dosages of AC electricity. It was agrisly affair, roundly denounced in newspapers the next day.Proponents of DC, missing no opportunity to promote their cause, took to sayingthat Kemmler had been “Westinghoused.” George Westinghouse himself said, “I donot care to talk about it. It has been a brutal affair. They could have donebetter with an axe.” Tesla, an ardent humanitarian, in later years expressed hisabhorrence of electrical execution. Harold Brown, with all the brouhaha over hisdemonstrations, quietly disappeared from the War of the Currents. And Edison,still seething from his battle against Westinghouse, continued to discredit hisadversary for years. In one last jab, in January 1903, Edison filmed a six-tonelephant named Topsy being publicly electrocuted at Coney Island in New York. Bythat time, the War of the Currents was long over and Tesla's AC system had beenaccepted worldwide.PARIS AND RADIO DISCOVERIESIn the meantime, Edison's early campaign against alternating current rockedWestinghouse's investors. Production of Tesla's induction motors ground to astandstill in 1899 and would not continue until after Tesla returned from Paris.While work had stopped in Pittsburgh, the Grand Street lab was abuzz. Beforedeparting for Paris, Tesla had begun early experiments in high-frequencyapparatus, the relationship between electromagnetic radiation and light, andwhat would become his lifelong obsession, the wireless transmission of energy.Barely five years after arriving in the United States with four cents in hispocket, Tesla at age 33 was a wealthy man and could sail to Paris in style. Thegreat attraction there was the Exposition Universelle, or Paris World's Fair,and its controversial modernist centerpiece, the Eiffel Tower. Also on displayat the exposition would be a number of new electrical exhibits and inventions,including the introduction of an Edison phonograph for the general public. WhileEdison was being lauded and celebrated by European dignitaries, Tesla had otherthings on his mind. He hoped, for example, that the Exposition might be anopportunity for him to catch up on the latest news in the field of electricalvibration regarding the relationship between alternating current and lightwaves. Here was his chance to confer with the most advanced theorists in Europe.During his stay in Paris, Tesla was also able to meet with the young Norwegianmathematician and physicist Vilhelm Bjerknes. It was an auspicious meeting, asBjerknes had collaborated with French mathematician Jules-Henri Poincaré inreproducing the experiments and had worked out the mathematics that confirmedthe findings of German physicist Heinrich Hertz on the propagation ofelectromagnetic waves through space. For Tesla, the visit was an opportunity tostudy Bjerknes's oscillator, which provided a variety of electromagnetic wavesand a resonator for augmenting them. Further, he discussed theoreticalimplications concerning the properties of the resulting electromagnetic waves.From these discussions, Tesla discovered that the electromagnetic waves, orHertzian waves not only produce transverse oscillations, but also longitudinalvibrations structured much like sound waves. According to Tesla biographer MarcJ. Seifer, these findings would be instrumental in Tesla's work over the nextdecade in his construction of wireless transmitters. It would lead to one of hismost important discoveries: the radio.Image [images/p059-001.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5THE “BIG SHOW”Image [images/p061-001.jpg]FOLLOWING A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH PROMINENT SCIENTISTS in Europe and a visitwith his family, Tesla returned to New York. With the departure of his friendAnthony Szigeti, the small size of his Grand Street laboratory, and his desirefor more space, Tesla opened a more spacious facility at 33-35 South FifthAvenue (now called LaGuardia Place) in 1899. Ironically the lab was located onlyblocks south of the Edison Electric Light Company's elaborate showroom andheadquarters at 65 Fifth Avenue and 14th Street, where Edison's new productswere on display.BACK IN THE U.S.A.Tesla was buoyed by his European sojourn. He stood out with his elegant attire,white gloves, and Continental manner. He took up residence in one of thecountry's most prestigious hotels, the Astor House, in Lower Manhattan near St.Paul's Chapel. Now a man of means, he dined regularly at Delmonico's, the mostfamous and exquisite restaurant in America. But he ate alone, indulging hisidiosyncrasies. Phobic about germs, he would use two dozen cloth napkins in asingle meal (adhering to his penchant for items divisible by three), wipingclean his dishes and silverware prior to eating.Image [images/p061-002.jpg]Although his fame was spreading, he remained a loner. On occasion he would meetwith Thomas Commerford Martin, by now his trusted publicist, or the engineers atWestinghouse who were working on projects associated with his patents. He wasespecially eager to apply the knowledge he had gained from his meeting withVilhelm Bjerknes in Paris to his own research on wireless transmission. Heplunged into his work, keeping a nocturnal schedule. His single-mindedness andaloofness become the stuff of legend. Transmission expert Frank Jenkins of theDuke Power Engineering Society remembered him like this:He was not an easy person to work for because he expected almost as much fromhis help as he did from himself. Since he could depend entirely on his memoryfor all details, he believed others could too if they tried hard enough. Herequired his machinist to work from memory. He was unable throughout his life tocooperate with others in acquiring knowledge and conducting research ... butpreferred to work independently.GENEROSITY TO WESTINGHOUSEBefore he could become completely absorbed in wireless transmission, otherproblems that demanded Tesla's attention were looming on the horizon. ForWestinghouse to continue implementing Tesla's AC system and motor, larger sumsof capital would be required. Edison's propaganda campaign was in full swingnow, and it had a ripple effect on Westinghouse's own backers. A number of thembegan to balk. Finally they delivered an ultimatum. Tesla had to modifyWestinghouse's equipment to run on higher frequencies, and Tesla's royaltyagreement had to be canceled. The demands left Westinghouse in a bind. Toconvince Tesla to nullify the contract would seriously jeopardize any prospectsfor Westinghouse to reap the benefits of an AC system in the future. As aninventor himself, moreover, he felt a strong sense of loyalty toward Tesla andunderstood the value of patent royalties.Faced with the unpleasant task of confronting Tesla, Westinghouse diplomaticallysuggested the following: if Tesla did not relinquish the royalty clause, then he(Westinghouse) would lose control over Tesla's patents. The negotiations betweenthe two men were vividly described by Tesla's personal friend and biographerJohn J. O'Neill:“I believe your polyphase system is the greatest discovery in the field ofelectricity,” Westinghouse explained....“Mr. Westinghouse,” said Tesla, “you have been my friend, you believed in mewhen others had no faith; you were brave enough to go ahead and pay me a milliondollars when others lacked courage.... The benefits that will come tocivilization from my polyphase system mean more to me than money involved. Mr.Westinghouse, you will save your company so that you can develop my inventions.Here is your contract and here is my contract – I will tear both of them topieces and you will no longer have any troubles from my royalties.”Matching his actions to his words Tesla tore up the contract.... Westinghouse,thanks to Tesla's magnificent gesture, was able to make good his promise toTesla to make his alternating current system available to the world. (O'Neill,Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla)At $2.50 per horsepower, Tesla lost an estimated $12 million with his act ofgenerosity under this arrangement.TELLURIDEWestinghouse was able to begin making good on his promise. The Gold King Mine inTelluride, Colorado, was in desperate financial straits, having all butexhausted its means of powering mining activities. It had depleted neighboringforestland and could no longer afford to cart in coal to fuel its machines.Company manager L.L. Nunn had read about the successes of Nikola Tesla andGeorge Westinghouse with alternating current power and was impressed by theirclaims that AC could be transmitted much longer distances than DC.Nunn was able to strike a deal with Tesla and Westinghouse to build the world'sfirst commercial-grade alternating-current power plant in Ames, Colorado, nearTelluride. Whereas electricity had been used in the past chiefly to power publiclighting, the initial transmission line for the Colorado mine delivered enoughpower to operate a 100-horsepower synchronous motor, itself started by a TeslaAC induction engine. The Ames Power Plant began operation in 1891, and Nunn'sventure would provide a model for the development of power distribution atNiagara Falls. For the time being, the word was out—AC power worked! It could betransmitted over many miles and power large equipment. The mine and the economyof Telluride were saved.Image [images/p063-001.jpg]SYNCHRONOUS MOTORA one-speed motor, or fixed motor, in which the speed is governed orsynchronized with the supply frequency.In this case, a Tesla AC induction motor supplied the electricity which causedthe speed of the rotor to be in sync with the rotating magnetic field of theTesla motor.Image [images/p064-001.jpg]TESLA COILSIn 1890–1891, as Westinghouse was negotiating the deal with Nunn that led to theAmes plant, Tesla was hardly sitting idle. Since he had ceded his royalties toWestinghouse, he would not receive income from the success of the ACinstallation in Colorado. He would need to develop other sources of revenue, andhis mind took off in three major directions. First, having successfullydelivered his polyphase induction system, he would seek the means to deliverpower wirelessly. Second, he would try to invent new methods of illumination.And third, he would investigate the wireless transmission of intelligence. Thesebroad goals established the direction of work that would occupy Tesla for thenext 50 years.The pursuit of the wireless transmission began at his Grand Street lab as he wasbusy exploring Hertz's work on high-frequency electromagnetic waves. Tesla wasdetermined to increase the frequency of electrical vibrations until they wereequal to light. He hoped to produce light more efficiently than the wastefulprocess used in Edison's incandescent light bulb. In the delivery of electricityto an Edison bulb, only 5% of the power was effective; the other 95% was lost toheat waves.CONDENSER OR CAPACITORAn electric circuit element used to store charge temporarily. A condensergenerally consists of two metallic plates that are separated and insulated fromeach other by a dielectric material, such as porcelain (ceramic).A dielectric is a poor conductor of electricity, but it is an efficientsupporter of an electromagnetic field. When repeated charges are acceleratedback and forth through the plates one magnetic field after another is produced.These fields will spread over large distances through space. The result is thatcapacitors are integral to radio frequencies.Drawing upon Lord Kelvin's 1856 theory of condenser discharge, for which noapparent use had yet been developed, Tesla embarked upon his own production ofelectrical oscillations. Kelvin had theorized that when a condenser isdischarged, its action is like the up-and-down bobbing that takes place when aweighted, stretched spring is released. The electricity, he showed, rushes fromone plate into the other and then back again; the process continues until allthe stored energy is used up in overcoming frictional losses. The back-and-forthsurges take place at an extremely high frequency, hundreds of millions persecond.Tesla reasoned that if he could build a device that continuously emitselectricity at higher frequencies, he would be able to achieve importanttechnical advantages. Among these would be lamps that glow more brilliantly andthe ability to transmit energy more efficiently. Tesla began his high-frequencyinvestigations by replicating Hertz's apparatus for giving off an electric sparkand propagating electromagnetic waves in space.At the heart of Hertz's machine was a large induction coil, consisting of aniron core wound with two different thicknesses of wire. A battery with one leadwould be connected to the iron core, and the other lead would run to a telegraphkey. That, in turn, would be connected to the thicker of the two wires(primary). Each of two leads—one running from the thinner wire (secondary) andone running from the iron core—would be attached to each of two electrodes, witha gap separating them. Every time current flowing from the battery to thetelegraph key was turned on or off, the induction coil produced high-voltagesparks between the two electrodes.Image [images/p066-001.jpg]Into this apparatus, Tesla introduced a capacitor and took to manipulating theinduction coil in and out. Eventually he would remove the iron core and rely onair cores for separate windings of both the primary and secondary wires, whichwere tuned to resonate. He would also replace the battery with an AC generator,as well as a step-up transformer.Image [images/p066-002.jpg]Sending electricity a long distance would require higher voltage, basically topush the current through the wires. However, the use of high voltages in homesand factories would be dangerous. The step-up transformer made it possible toincrease low-voltage, high-current AC to high-voltage, low-current AC at higherfrequencies. This was not possible with direct current, however, since DC couldonly be distributed over short distances. Eventually a distribution transformerwas introduced in the system to step down the higher voltages needed infactories, or for high-speed electric trains. For more modest domestic uses, ahome-supply transformer would be introduced to further step down thedistribution to 110 volts.Image [images/p066-003.jpg]Tesla was attempting to manipulate the vibrations of every capacitor dischargeand obtain higher voltages from the current produced by an induction coil.Tinkering in this way finally enabled him to control the amount of discharge aswell as the frequency. He called his machine an oscillating generator. Hisfindings were reflected in his application for Tesla PATENT 462,418 – METHOD OFAND APPARATUS FOR ELECTRICAL CONVERSION AND DISTRIBUTION, filed on February 4,1891. It was granted on November 3, 1891. The invention would ultimately becomeknown as the Tesla coil. With its primary and secondary circuits both tuned tovibrate in harmony, the Tesla coil would be one of his greatest inventions. Itwould be used in various forms for the future of radio and television.Image [images/p067-001.jpg]“Awesome” could easily be the word for what Tesla observed next. Sparks of greatlength and frequency would spout from the coils in his lab not connected to thepower-generating primary coil. Because the different secondary coils were tunedto the same wavelength or frequency of the primary coil, the secondary coilswould erupt in sparks. Observing this, Tesla devised all shapes of coils thatset the lab awash in streaking jolts of electricity. In working with such highvoltages, he made sure to keep one hand in his pocket to avoid completing acircuit that could electrocute him on the spot. At last he was transmittingenergy wirelessly! He planned a spectacular demonstration of the new principle,in which he would wave unconnected glass tubes that looked like flaming swordsand could, to everyone's amazement, light up a room.The Crookes radiometer loomed large in Tesla's thinking. English physicist andchemist Sir William Crookes's experiments and spiritual investigations in the19th century greatly influenced Tesla's thinking. The Crookes radiometer, todayconsidered a novelty item, was basically a glass globe with the air removed.Inside was a system of vanes, each blackened on one side and polished on theother, that rotated when exposed to radiant energy. Crookes developed theradiometer to utilize vacuum balance in his research on the element thallium. Henever did provide a true explanation for the apparent “attraction and repulsionresulting from radiation.”Image [images/p067-002.jpg]Image [images/p068-001.jpg]What might have attracted Tesla to the radiometer was Crookes's use early on ofhigh-voltage current produced by an old-fashioned induction coil to achieverotation. Tesla believed that he could achieve more far-reaching results byfashioning other devices for illumination: glass tubes that enclosed differentgases such as argon and xenon, or had the air removed from them; an incandescentcarbon button lamp (his single-electrode incandescent lamp); fluorescent tubes,and neon-filled tubes in the shape of letters.Experimenting in this way, Tesla produced four new kinds of lamps: 1. Tubes in which a solid body became incandescent; 2. Tubes in which phosphorescent and fluorescent materials were made to illuminate; 3. Tubes in which rarefied gases became luminous, and 4. Tubes in which luminosity was produced in gases at ordinary pressure.Applying the strategy he learned from Peck and Brown, Tesla filed patentapplications 454,622 – SYSTEM OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING, and 455,069 – ELECTRICINCANDESCENT LAMP, in spring 1891. With that done, he was ready to demonstratehis endeavors publicly. He enlisted his friend Thomas Commerford Martin tolaunch a campaign to publicize his work on high-frequency AC.COLUMBIA COLLEGE LECTUREMartin arranged for Tesla to deliver another lecture to the American Instituteof Electrical Engineers (AIEE), on May 20, 1891, at Columbia College. Before thesame body three years earlier, he had delivered his groundbreaking paper, “A NewSystem of Alternate Current Motors and Transformers.” This time he would be aneven greater showman, beguiling his audience with fantastic, never-before-seendemonstrations of wireless illumination. To say that his display was mesmerizingwould not do it justice. Was he using sleight of hand? Were there tricks up hissleeve? Quite the contrary. He was able to explain each of his demonstrationswith prodigious mathematical formulas and detailed schematics. It was allscience, and Tesla held his audience in thrall for over three hours.Image [images/p069-001.jpg]Biographer Thomas Commerford Martin recorded this lecture and others in TheInventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla (1894). According toMartin's account,Mr. Tesla did not hesitate to show many new and brilliant experiments, and toadvance the frontier of discovery far beyond any point he had theretofore markedpublicly. . . The ground covered by them is so vast that only the leading ideasand experiments can here be touched upon; besides, it is preferable that thelectures should be carefully gone over for their own sake, it being more thanlikely that each student will discover a new beauty or stimulus in them.THE TESLA LECTURESImage [images/p069-002.jpg]For the Columbia College lecture, he pulled out all the stops. Not only would hewave around his “flaming swords,” he would treat his audience to something veryspecial. Witnesses would report:With hundreds of thousands of volts of high-frequency currents surging acrosshis body, he would hold in his hand a strangely powerful little “carbon-button”lamp. Energy from his body caused gas molecules in the tube to bombard a smallbutton of carborundum until it glowed to incandescence, resulting in a lighttwenty times brighter than any other lamp in existence. The energy inside thebulb was so powerful that it vaporized diamonds and rubies. (Cheney and Uth,Tesla: Master of Lightning)For dramatic effect, he held the carbon button lamp aloft like the Statue ofLiberty. Although never produced or marketed for practical purposes, the carbonbutton lamp was used for experiments in which Tesla bombarded rubies withelectrical or molecular energy—a forerunner of today's laser technology and atomsmashing.The Columbia lecture produced a groundswell of excitement and a rush tocapitalize on his inventions. Still, the naysayers, doubters, and self-promoterscame forward to dispute Tesla's findings or to claim credit for having coveredthe same ground in their own experiments. Tesla took on all challengers, butsuch prominent electrical engineers as Elihu Thompson and Michael Pupin (afellow Serb) took the bait and insisted that they had discovered thehigh-frequency principles long before Tesla. In the end, Tesla's patentsaffirmed time after time that his work was original and path-breaking.The full import and possibilities of the Tesla coil have remained undeterminedto the present day, since Tesla worked out much of the mathematics in his head,never committing it to paper. Scientists, physicists, and electrical engineerscontinue in their efforts to unravel many of the secrets Tesla took to hisgrave. His investigations and trials with the Tesla coil is some of his leastunderstood work.Similarly, Tesla's work on high-frequency currents led to a number ofdiscoveries that he never patented. Among the by-products are modern electricclocks, x-ray photography, and therapeutic deep-heat healing effects that laidthe foundation for the medical field of diathermy. Yet even these advances tooka backseat to his lifelong obsession with the wireless transmission of energy.Indeed it was his work in this area that ultimately earned him the labels ofmagician, sorcerer, wizard, shaman, mystic, “man with lightning in his hand,”“master of lightning,” and “electrical messiah.”Image [images/p071-001.jpg]Image [images/p071-002.jpg]CITIZENSHIPJust seven years after his arrival in the United States, Tesla's ColumbiaCollege lecture catapulted him to the forefront of this country's electricalinventors. With all the accolades and press coverage that followed hispresentation to the AIEE, he was pressured to deliver lectures in Europe. Beforedoing so, however, he achieved what he considered one of his highest honors—U.S.citizenship. “The papers ... that conferred on me the honor of Americancitizenship,” he would later write, “are always kept in a safe, while my otherorders, diplomas, degrees, gold medals and other distinctions are packed away inold trunks.”Ironically, Tesla's naturalization documents, dated July 30, 1891, listed him asresiding at the Hotel Gerlach (currently the Radio Wave Building), at 49 West27th Street in New York City. It was an early indication of his movements fromhotel to hotel—a pattern that would continue for the rest of his life. He filledin his occupation as “civil engineer” and his former nationality as “Austrian”.The pride Tesla took in his citizenship would be reflected just two days later,on August 1, 1891, when he filed his application for Patent 464,667 – ELECTRICCONDENSER. In it he proudly identified himself as a “citizen of the UnitedStates.”With that patent, Tesla set the record straight regarding improvements above andbeyond his demonstration for the AIEE in which he passed gas-filled tubes thatglowed between two electrically charged plates. Indeed it marked an importantstep forward in his efforts to transmit wireless energy over long distances.Image [images/p072-001.jpg]LONDON AND PARIS LECTURESNever one to gloat over the success of his lectures, Tesla was anxious to resumehis research on wireless energy after the AIEE event. How currents pass throughthe Earth was a phenomenon he was especially eager to explore, as highlighted inhis later account of the Columbia lecture.While the spontaneous success of my lecture was due to spectacular features, itschief import was in showing that all kinds of devices could be operated thru asingle wire without return. This was the initial step in the evolution of mywireless system. The idea presented itself to me that it might be possible,under observance of proper conditions of resonance, to transmit electric energythru the earth, thus dispensing with all artificial conductors. (“The TrueWireless,” Electrical Experimenter, May 1919)Tesla did his best to shut out the many invitations, honors, and otherflattering inducements being offered to him and ardently pursued his research ingrounding. But the demands for personal appearances finally became irresistible,and Tesla agreed to address the Institution of Electrical Engineers in London.On the night of February 3, 1892, he took the podium before a British audiencein formal attire and rapt attention. Elegant as ever himself, Tesla rose to newlevels of showmanship. His “magic wands,” button lamp, and gales of electricalsparks circling his body brought resounding cheers from the audience. His coupde grace was to take an apparatus similar to the Crookes radiometer and place itin the electric field generated between two electrified zinc plates, causing thevanes to begin spinning. Here was Tesla demonstrating the first wireless motor.On hand for Tesla's demonstration were some of England's most prominentphysicists and electrical engineers, including his heroes William Thomson (LordKelvin) and Sir William Crookes. So ecstatic was the crowd that he was urged torepeat his lecture the following evening for an equally august body of leadingscientists. Sir James Dewar, a Scottish chemist and physicist best known for hiswork with low-temperature phenomena and the inventor of the Dewar flask, wasinstrumental in bringing about the second lecture. Recounting his reluctance tostay on, Tesla wrote the following:It had been my intention to leave immediately for Paris in compliance with asimilar obligation, but Sir James Dewar insisted on my appearing before theRoyal Institution. I was a man of firm resolve but succumbed easily to theforceful arguments of the great Scotchman. He pushed me into a chair and pouredout half a glass of a wonderful brown fluid which sparkled in all sorts ofiridescent colors and tasted like nectar. “Now,” said he, “you are sitting inFaraday's chair and you are enjoying whiskey he used to drink.” In both aspectsit was an enviable experience. The next evening I gave a demonstration beforethat Institution. (My Inventions)His stay in London also enabled Tesla to solidify his European electricalpatents and to meet with many other physicists and electrical engineers. Mostnotable for him was the opportunity to present Lord Kelvin and Sir WilliamCrookes with their own Tesla coils. His extended visit with Crookes was devotedto discussing their respective research, the potential uses of electricity,their personal backgrounds, and their religious beliefs. The discussion turnedto the supernatural, of which Tesla was not an actual believer. Exhausted andunder strain, he was not able to muster much of a defense against Crookes, whowould later serve as president of the Society of Psychical Research. IndeedTesla paused to consider. “I might not have paid attention to other men,” helater wrote, “but was susceptible to his [Crookes's] arguments, as it was hisepochal work on radiant matter, which I had read as a student, that made meembrace the electrical career. I reflected that the conditions for a look intothe beyond were most favorable.”From London he rushed to Paris, where he was to deliver two scheduled lectures.To say that Tesla's lectures and demonstrations rocked the news media andscientific community would be an understatement. After the first of the twolectures in Paris, however, he returned to his hotel and received a message thathis mother Djuka was in failing health back in Gospić. Tesla would not stayaround to give the second lecture or to bask in all the attention, even if thatwas his style. The sheer effort of lecturing, answering questions, and dealingwith patent issues, combined with his irregular sleeping habits, was catching upwith him. He left Paris immediately.STAYING ON IN EUROPEThe sleepless rush to Gospić caused a patch of Tesla's hair to turn whiteovernight, though it returned to its natural jet black color within a month. Inany event, he arrived at his dying mother's bedside just in time.Tesla never heeded the cautions of Sir William Crookes and others that he seemedon the verge of a physical or nervous breakdown. His condition at this time ledto a harrowing experience that he recounted years later:I had become completely exhausted by pain and long vigilance.... As I layhelpless, I thought if my mother died while I was away from her bedside shewould surely give me a sign.... I reflected that the conditions for a look intothe beyond were most favorable....During the whole night every fiber in my brain was strained in expectancy, butnothing happened until early in the morning, when I fell in a sleep ... and sawa cloud carrying angelic figures ... one of whom gazed upon me lovingly andgradually assumed the features of my mother. The appearance slowly floatedacross the room and vanished, and I was awakened by an indescribably sweet songof many voices. In that instant a certitude, which no words can express, cameupon me that my mother had just died.... This occurred long ago, and I havenever had the faintest reason since to change my views on psychical andspiritual phenomena, for which there is absolutely no foundation. (MyInventions)Image [images/p075-001.jpg]This would not be Tesla's first nor last journey into the psychic orsupernatural world. Crookes's admonitions and own spiritual research wereintrinsic to a great deal of Tesla's thinking thereafter, and ultimately wouldplay a large part in his unraveling.Following his mother's passing on April 4, 1892, Tesla suffered the predictedbreakdown. He spent a number of weeks recovering and visiting with grievingfamily members. During the time in his home country, he was accorded specialhonors by various Serbian dignitaries and solidified his status as a nationalhero. Yet it was also a time of mental stocktaking, since he was unable toconduct any laboratory work and needed to restore his own energy.SHAPING A GRANDIOSE PLANFinally it was time to formulate plans and resume his work in America. With hishealth fully restored, Tesla mulled over advice he had been given in London byLord Rayleigh:I never realized that I possessed any particular gift of discovery but LordRayleigh, whom I always considered as an ideal man of science, had said so andif that was the case I felt that I should concentrate on some big idea.One day, as I was roaming in the mountains, I sought shelter from an approachingstorm.... All of a sudden, there was a lightning flash and a few moments after adeluge. ... [T]he two phenomena were closely related, as cause and effect, and alittle reflection led me to the conclusion that the electrical energy involvedin the precipitation of the water was inconsiderable, the function of lightningbeing much like that of a sensitive trigger.... If we could produce electriceffects of the required quality, this whole planet and conditions of existenceon it could be transformed. The sun raises the water of the oceans and windsdrive it to distant regions where it remains in a state of most delicatebalance. If it were in our power to upset it . . . this mighty life-sustainingstream could be at will controlled. We could irrigate arid deserts, create lakesand rivers and provide motive power in unlimited amounts. This would be the mostefficient way of harnessing the sun to the uses of man. The consummationdepended on our ability to develop electric forces of the order of those innature. It seemed a hopeless undertaking, but I made up my mind to try it andimmediately on my return to the United States, in the summer of 1892, work wasbegun ... because a means of the same kind was necessary for the successfultransmission of energy without wires. (My Inventions)Tesla's time in Europe would prove pivotal. He set the English and Frenchscientific communities abuzz, wrapped up family matters, and was ready to returnto the United States with renewed vigor. Upon his arrival in New York, hesettled into the Hotel Gerlach and increased his Fifth Avenue laboratory staff.He was ready to embark on global and perhaps interstellar research, as suggestedby his discussions with Rayleigh and Crookes.This time, however, he was interrupted by two lectures to which he hadcommitted, at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in February 1893, andbefore the annual meeting of the National Electric Light Association in St.Louis in March 1893. Although much of the material was similar to his previouslectures, for the first time he expanded on the tuning of two different coils tothe same frequency. In essence this was a rudimentary display of the essentialcomponents of radio: a transmitter, receiver, antenna, ground connection, andtuning device. The spark of one coil would transmit electric waves through theair that had been received by the other coil and then converted back intoelectricity. In his lecture at the Franklin Institute, titled “High Frequencyand High Potential Currents,” Tesla told the audience:I would say a few words on a subject which constantly fills my thoughts andwhich concerns the welfare of all. I mean the transmission of intelligiblesignals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires. I ambecoming daily more convinced of the practicality of the scheme.... I know fullwell that the great majority of scientific men will not believe that suchresults can be practically and immediately realized.... My conviction has grownso strong, that I no longer look upon this plan of energy or intelligencetransmission as mere theoretical possibility, but as a serious problem inelectrical engineering, which must be carried out some day. The idea oftransmitting intelligence without wires is the natural outcome of the mostrecent results of electrical investigation.Image [images/p077-001.jpg]As if these words were not enough to strike awe in his listeners, he broughtthem to the edge of their seats with a demonstration he described and explainedin the lecture as follows:On one set of the terminals of the coil, I have placed a large sphere of sheetbrass, which is connected to a larger insulated brass plate.... I now set thecoil to work and approach the free terminal with a metallic object held in myhand.... As I approach the metallic object to a distance of eight or ten inches,a torrent of furious sparks breaks forth from the end of the secondary wire,which passes through the rubber column. The sparks cease when the metal in handtouches the wire. My arm is now traversed by a powerful electric current,vibrating at about the rate of one million times a second. All around me theelectrostatic force makes itself felt, and the air molecules and particles ofdust flying about are acted upon and are hammering violently against my body. Sogreat is this agitation of the particles, that when the lights are turned outyou may see streams of feeble light appear on some parts of my body.... Thestreamers offer no particular inconvenience, except that in the ends of thefingertips a burning sensation is felt.... The streams of light which you haveobserved issuing from my hand are due to a potential of about 200,000 volts,alternating in rather irregular intervals, sometimes like a million times asecond.Years later, he would proudly sit in front of a camera to pose for the oftenreproduced photo of him holding a wirelessly illuminated light bulb—confirmationof his unofficial titles as “Father of the Wireless.”Image [images/p078-001.jpg]WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITIONDuring Tesla's absence overseas, Westinghouse faced dire financial problems. Hefound it financially burdensome to develop Tesla's polyphase AC system and wasmore interested in broadening the single-phase AC system, for which there was anexisting market.Westinghouse was on the verge of losing his status in the electricity industry,as larger electric companies were swallowing up smaller companies. Even EdisonGeneral Electric and the Thomson Houston Electric Company had merged in February1892 to become General Electric (GE). J.P. Morgan, one of Edison's principalinvestors, attained even greater wealth and financial control with the merger.All but forgotten in the takeover was the fact that Morgan had been the firstperson to install Edison's incandescent lighting system in his home.Westinghouse, his credit overextended, needed to do something bold to regaincredibility with his investors.Looming on the horizon was the World's Columbian Exposition—the Chicago WorldFair of 1893—to mark the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival inthe New World. Frederick Law Olmsted, America's foremost landscape architect,was responsible for laying out the fairgrounds, which occupied 639 acres next toLake Michigan. It took three years to construct the fairgrounds and its 200buildings. The exposition featured more than 250,000 displays and attractions,including the world's first Ferris Wheel, invented by George W. Ferris. SophieHayden, the first woman awarded a degree in architecture from the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology (MIT), designed the famous Woman's Building. Only onestructure from the original fairgrounds still stands today: the Palace of FineArts, transformed in 1931 into the Museum of Science and Industry.A celebration of American industrialism and innovation, the fair would be lit byelectricity. Bids were solicited, and the jousting was nasty—especially betweenWestinghouse (betting on an AC system) and General Electric (relying on DC).Here was the culmination of the War of the Currents. In the end, Westinghouseunderbid all competitors and won the contract.Image [images/p079-001.jpg]It was a bold move on many levels. First, Westinghouse stood to lose a fortune.Second, it would be a severe test to prove that Tesla's AC system was capable oflighting what amounted to a whole city. Failure would jeopardize chances ofsecuring a contract for the pending Niagara Falls hydroelectric power generationproject. Third, Edison held the patent on light bulbs and threatened to sueWestinghouse should Edison lamps show up among the 250,000 bulbs needed forfairground lighting.Westinghouse retaliated by inventing his own device—the Westinghouse “stopper”bulb. As opposed to the one-piece fused-glass seal used in the Edison bulb, theWestinghouse innovation employed a ground-glass stopper mated to the bulbenvelope for sealing. In the course of just a few months, Westinghousefeverishly produced thousands of these bulbs, a multitude of motors, and anentire two-phase Tesla AC system.On May 1, 1893, atop a balcony of the fair's Administration Building, PresidentGrover Cleveland ceremoniously pressed a gold-and-ivory telegraph key. Athousand feet away in Machinery Hall, an anxious group of Westinghouse engineerscrowded around a 2,000-horsepower steam engine as it roared to life. The massivesteam engine powered the Westinghouse generators, which pulsed electricitythrough the fairgrounds. The crowd roared with delight, as three huge fountainsat the Court of Honor sent plumes of water soaring a hundred feet in the air.For the Westinghouse crew, all was right with the world. The spectacle ofbuildings, walkways, and fountains gushing with shimmering, color-changing lightwas a fairyland vision. Westinghouse had succeeded beyond all expectations withTesla's AC system. It was a resounding defeat for Edison and the death knell ofthe War of the Currents.For the time being, Tesla remained behind the scenes and largely unheralded.When the Electricity Building opened on the fairgrounds in June, Westinghouseand Tesla would have the opportunity to beguile the American public with theirvision of cheap power. It was a dream almost too momentous to imagine,revolutionizing the way people manage the physical world, how they spend theirevening hours, and the very nature of work and leisure. Here for the first time,millions would see the electrical motors that would take over the burdensomephysical tasks long performed by man or his animals, and the lamps that wouldlight their houses.Inside the Electricity Building, inventors rolled out their latest electricalgadgets, many of them dubious: electrically charged belts for a better sex life,electric body invigorators, and electrical hairbrushes. Edison displayed hisphonograph and dazzled visitors with an eight-foot, half-ton incandescent lightbulb. Ironically this was one of few Edison bulbs on display at the fair, sinceWestinghouse's stopper lamps were illuminating the grounds.Tesla, too, would have his turn in the limelight. Soon he would take centerstage as America's foremost Wizard of Physics. For the time being, he was backat his New York lab continuing his high-oscillation research. It would take avisit by Westinghouse to convince him how important it was to demonstrate his ACpolyphase motor and machinery before the International Electrical Congress.Westinghouse reasoned that by demonstrating the AC systems, its commercialmotors, and his oscillators, Tesla would cement his credibility with theforemost electricians in the world.Tesla took the bait. He journeyed to Chicago that summer where a large part ofthe Westinghouse exhibit in the Electricity Building was devoted to hismachinery. The display featured wireless-illuminated glass tubes shaped into thenames of distinguished physicists; high-frequency currents sparkled magicallyaround the room. According to the account of Thomas Commerford Martin, theapparatus represented the fruits of Tesla's labor over ten years:It embraced a large number of different alternating motors and his earlier highfrequency apparatus, disruptive discharge coils, and high frequencytransformers. Among them a large ring intended to exhibit the phenomena of therotating magnetic field [a large Egg of Columbus]. The field produced was verypowerful and exhibited striking effects, revolving copper balls and eggs andbodies of various shapes at considerable distances and at great speeds. (TheInventions, Researches, and Writings of Nikola Tesla)Image [images/p081-001.jpg]Although many of the devices appealed specifically to the thousand electricalcognoscenti in attendance, Tesla was about to dazzle the assembled throng with adisplay of unparalleled showmanship at his August 25 lecture. He looked gauntand exhausted as he took the stage in a beautifully tailored gray-brownfour-button cutaway suit. To anyone who noticed, his shoes wereunusual—thick-soled with what looked like cork. Gauging the crowd like aseasoned showman, he delivered his lecture on mechanical and electricaloscillations at a methodical pace, supporting his theories with oscillators thatcould be used to transmit information or electrical energy. Building suspense,he beguiled the crowd with an Egg of Columbus that simultaneously spun balls,pivoted discs, and animated other devices that demonstrated principles of therotating magnetic field and his theory of planetary motion. And then he put on ashow, flashing giant sparks, lighting all sizes and shapes of protofluorescentlamps, and finally lighting himself up with a million volts of electricitypassing through his body. Unharmed, he dramatically disproved Edison's chargethat alternating current was deadly. It was theater of the highest order (JillJonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrifythe World).Over 25 million people attended the World's Fair, and many were seeingelectricity for the first time. The excitement that Tesla ignited at the World'sColumbian Exhibition has continued to influence electrical invention to thepresent day. His spectacle brought waves of adulation and made him a mediadarling in the burgeoning years of newspaper and magazine publishing. Society atlarge, people in influential places, scientific intelligentsia worldwide, and,most importantly, potential investors wanted a piece of him.Elated but exhausted, Tesla returned to New York. He had a lot of work in frontof him and needed large amounts of money to fund his research. T.C. Martinstepped in to orchestrate the next step in fund-raising. With the inventor'scooperation, he collected ten years of Tesla's lectures, articles, anddiscussions and readied them for publication. The compendium detailed all ofTesla's inventions up to December 1893, particularly those bearing on polyphasemotors and the effects obtained with currents of high potential and highfrequency.Yet even Martin was reluctant to include material on Tesla's work on wirelesstransmission. Like many others, Martin considered the prospects far-fetched. AsTesla would recount in a 1919 article for the Electrical Experimenter, he wasprevented from publishing all but the scantest information on the wirelesstransmission of energy.I only need to say that as late as 1893, when I had prepared an elaboratechapter on my wireless system, dwelling on its various instrumentalities andfuture prospects ... friends of mine emphatically protested against itspublication on the ground that such idle and far-fetched speculations wouldinjure me in the opinion of conservative business men. So it came that only asmall part of what I had intended to say was embodied in my address of that yearbefore the Franklin Institute and National Electric Light Association under thechapter “On Electrical Resonance.” This little salvage from the wreck has earnedme the title of “Father of the Wireless” from many well-disposed fellow workers,rather than the invention of scores of appliances which have brought wirelesstransmission within the reach of every young amateur and which, in a time notdistant, will lead to undertakings overshadowing in magnitude and importance allpast achievements of the engineer.Martin's manuscript, running nearly 500 pages, was published in 1894 as TheInventions, Researches, and Writings of Nikola Tesla. In the short term, thepublication bolstered Tesla'scredibility and spurred new interest amongpotential investors. Beyond that, the collection documented Tesla's pioneeringwork for succeeding generations of scientists and inventors.Image [images/p083-001.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6ELECTRIFYING DREAMSImage [images/p085-001.jpg]If we use fuel to get our power, we are living on our capital and exhausting itrapidly. This method is barbarous and wantonly wasteful and will have to bestopped in the interest of coming generations.... The inevitable conclusion isthat water power is by far our most valuable resource. On this humanity mustbuild its hopes for the future. With its full development and a perfect systemof wireless transmission of the energy to any distance, man will be able tosolve all the problems of material existence. Distance, which is the chiefimpediment to human progress, will be completely annihilated in thought, word,and action. Humanity will be united, wars will be made impossible, and peacewill reign supreme.—Nikola TeslaIF HIS LECTURES, EUROPEAN AND CROSS COUNTRY TRAVEL, publications, patentfilings, mother's death, nervous breakdown, residential and laboratoryrelocations, ongoing research, and discoveries in the wireless transmission ofenergy during the period 1892–1893 were not daunting enough, Tesla was about toenter into a milieu that stretched him even further. It was one thing toconcentrate so much of his energy on engineering research and the scientificcommunity. Now he had to face the social elite, the Wall Street financiers, andthe countless hangers-on that sought a firsthand audience with him. Often afterworking all day on a project, he would take dinner at posh Delmonico'srestaurant and invite celebrities back to his lab for some startlinglate-evening demonstration. On one occasion, he brought Mark Twain to tears byrelating how the author's works were instrumental in healing Tesla's direillness as a teenager. The recounting of this incident cemented a lifelongfriendship between the two men. Twain relished the opportunity to promote one ofTesla's seemingly risky inventions.At one evening visit to the lab, according to an oft-repeated story, Twain askedfor a demonstration of the benefits of Tesla's work with therapeutichigh-frequency oscillators. The famous author ended up furnishing the evening'sentertainment when he insisted upon experiencing the gyrations of a platformmounted on an electrified oscillator. Tesla tried to dissuade him, or pretendedto, which made Twain all the more determined to prolong the test. Once mountedon the machine, he kept repeating, “More, Tesla more!” Finally, however, hecried out for help, since (as Tesla well knew) one of the effects of suchoscillations on the human body was to create turmoil in the bowels.Image [images/p086-001.jpg]While working closely with Thomas Commerford Martin on The Inventions,Researches, and Writings of Nikola Tesla, the inventor was introduced to RobertUnderwood Johnson and his wife Katharine. As editor of The Century Magazine,arguably the most popular periodical in the United States at the time, Johnsonwielded an extraordinary amount of influence. He and Katharine counted amongtheir circle of friends some of America's best-known artists, writers,politicians, and wealthy industrialists.The Johnsons were intellectually curious, patronized the arts, and enjoyedstimulating conversation. Tesla was a perfect match for their friendship and afrequent guest at their Lexington Avenue soirées. They became lifelong friendsand exchanged frequent letters, including some amorous ones from Katharine toTesla. Not least among their shared interests was the paranormal, a topic ofearnest conversation. Katharine Johnson was taken by Tesla's Old World charmbut, since she was married, she tried to pass him off to other rich doyennes—tono avail. Tesla was very much married to his work and avoided romanticentanglements.Image [images/p087-001.jpg]Evenings with the Johnsons—to whom he affectionately referred as Luka and MadamFilipov, after a favorite Serbian poem titled Luka Filipov—were an opportunityfor Tesla to mingle with the social and cultural elite. Among those he met therewere authors Rudyard Kipling and Mark Twain; actors Sarah Bernhardt, EleonoraDuse, and Joseph Jefferson; pianist Ignace Paderewski; composer Antonin Dvorak;naturalist John Muir; and architect Stanford White.Through his associations with Martin and Johnson, Tesla's name appearedfrequently in the popular press and his articles gained high exposure. TheInventions, Researches, and Writings of Nikola Tesla received strong reviewsboth stateside and abroad, and went into a number of editions.In early 1894, during some of his evening forays at the laboratory with Martinand Johnson, Tesla experimented with early photography by phosphorescent light.He posed for several images himself and others with Twain, Jefferson, andJohnson. Several of the photos made their public debut in Martin's article aboutTesla in the April 1895 issue of The Century Magazine. Tesla would go on towrite his own article for The Century, titled “The Problem of Increasing HumanEnergy,” in June 1900.Image [images/p088-001.jpg]HARNESSING NIAGARA FALLSIf Tesla was basking in the limelight, Westinghouse was never one to standstill. As early as fall 1890, he had his eye on a Niagara Falls power projectinstigated by the Cataract Construction Company. At the start, it was proposedas a hydraulic waterwheel power system. The plan was to divert water from thetop of the falls through a system of canals and tunnels to power the factoriesin the village below. The water would drain back into the river through a longtailrace tunnel so as not to mar the landscape near the falls.Operating in the background over the next two years, Westinghouse monitored theplan's progress. He knew that his success in Telluride and a resounding victoryat the Chicago World's Fair could give him a distinct advantage when it cametime to bidding on the Niagara Falls contract. In the back of his mind was thefeeling that Tesla's AC system would prove more fruitful than any otherproposal.CATARACTCataract is another word for a huge waterfall, as well as what we have come toknow as the clouding of a lens inside an eye.With the tailrace already underway, the original project organizers, led by NewYork attorney William Birch Rankine, realized that completion would take anenormous amount of capital—more than they had. Rankine approached financier J.P.Morgan for help, but he was lukewarm to the project because it lacked top-notchleadership. Morgan would invest only if Edward Dean Adams, a prominent WallStreet investment banker (and direct descendant of presidents John Adams andJohn Quincy Adams) could be brought in to take control of the finances andengineering. Adams was a major stockholder in the Edison Electric Company andhappened to live next door to J.P. Morgan in New York.TAILRACE TUNNELA tailrace tunnel, or runoff, serves the same purpose as an above-groundmillrace. It is situated below a water wheel, and through it the siphoned waterflows back to the river.Instituted as president of the Cataract Construction Company, Adams was forcedto divest his Edison stock in order to avoid a conflict of interest. He thenestablished the International Niagara Commission to attract the best Americanand European scientific and engineering minds to advise the project. To head theCommission, he secured the services of Britain's Lord Kelvin himself, still akeen proponent of DC. It was a shrewd move on Adams's part to gather thesedistinguished people and engage them in a contest. Those with the best ideas forharnessing the power of Niagara Falls to transmit energy across great distanceswould be awarded financial prizes. Among those who balked at the competition wasWestinghouse, who commented, “These people are trying to secure $100,000 worthof information by offering prizes, the largest of which is $3,000. When they areready to do business, we will show them how to do it.”A number of proposals were submitted, and most were rejected out of hand. Whenthe final bidding opened, there were four that entailed DC power generation andtwo, from J.P. Morgan's General Electric and from Westinghouse, that wouldutilize Tesla's polyphase AC system.Image [images/p090-001.jpg]Adams and the Niagara Falls Power Company were finally swayed by Tesla'spersonal appeals and a commitment to transmit power beyond Niagara to Buffalo,and as far as New York City. On May 6, 1893, Adams declared that polyphasealternating current would be their choice for the Niagara project. Six monthslater, after a series of ugly patent infringement suits between GE andWestinghouse, Adams awarded Westinghouse the contract for building thegenerators (which Tesla would design) and another contract to GE for buildingthe 22-mile transmission line from Niagara to Buffalo.In the end, the venture brought investments from some of the wealthiestindustrialists in North America in addition to Morgan, such as John Jacob AstorIV, Lord Rothschild, and W.K. Vanderbilt. It was an ambitious and agonizingproject, plagued throughout by doubt and financial skittishness. Stanford Whitewas engaged to design what become known as the Edward Dean Adams Power Stationto house the great Westinghouse/Tesla generators. From contract to completion,only one person, Nikola Tesla, remained positively convinced that the systemwould work.Image [images/p090-002.jpg]DISASTER STRIKESAs the Niagara project went forward during the next three years, Tesla continuedthe exhaustive pace of research at his New York lab, exploring wireless systemsto transmit light, power, and communication. William Rankine and Edward DeanAdams were so taken with his ability to keep the Niagara project on course thatthey offered him $100,000 for a controlling interest in 14 of his patents andthe rights to future inventions. Tesla accepted the offer, and the Nikola TeslaCompany was founded in February 1895, with Rankin and Adams joining him on theboard of directors. The money was much needed, as Tesla had not reaped any fundsfrom the AC system utilized in the Niagara project; he had relinquished alllicensing rights to Westinghouse. Fortunately, he still received consultationfor his input into the project.Image [images/p091-001.jpg]Disaster struck on March 13, 1895, when Tesla's South Fifth Avenue lab wasengulfed in fire and the entire building destroyed. His whole world was on thebrink of collapse. Equipment, notes, research papers, and years of experimentswent up in flames. Although many of his generators and oscillators were housedelsewhere, pioneering work on radio, the wireless transmission of energy, andliquefying oxygen were obliterated. All his thinking would have to bereconstructed from scratch. And he was uninsured to boot.At first he wandered the streets in despair. An imploring letter from KatharineJohnson, earnest support from Thomas Commerford Martin, and the well-wishes ofothers eventually lifted Tesla from his despondency. Although he was stillbereft of income, financial support from Adams and a burst of self-determinationhad him searching for a new lab.Ironically, the first offer of space came from Edison's laboratory in LlewellynPark, New Jersey, which granted him lab privileges. In late March, he was ableto rent space at 46-48 East Houston Street in Lower Manhattan (currently betweenLafayette and Mulberry Streets) to house his own lab. Tesla biographer MargaretCheney would later relate his feelings:I was so blue and discouraged in those days that I don't believe I could haveborne up but for the regular electric treatment which I administered to myself.You see, electricity puts into the tired body just what it most needs – lifeforce, nerve force. It's a great doctor, I can tell you, perhaps the greatest ofall doctors.By July he had the lab up and running and was ready to continue his experimentsin the wireless transmission of power and in two new areas, X-rays and radiocontrol. He worked on improving his oscillating transformer to power a newvacuum tube lamp, which he claimed gave out more light and was more efficientthan Edison's incandescent lamps. To demonstrate the power of his new bulb, heposed for a famous photo reading James Clerk Maxwell's Scientific Papers whileseated in a chair given to him by Edward Dean Adams; in the background is alarge spiral coil that Tesla was using in his wireless power experiments.SUCCESS AT NIAGARA FALLSWhile invigorated by his new lab and the work he was doing there, Tesla wasmentally anguished by the South Fifth Avenue lab fire. He knew he needed a breakfrom his routine and felt that relief might come from a visit to Niagara Falls.After rejecting invitations for years, he finally made his first visit there inJuly 1896.With Westinghouse, Rankine, Adams, other members of the Cataract ConstructionCompany, and a throng of reporters, Tesla toured the power system, which wasalready up and running. The big question at the time was whether the systemwould be capable of transmitting electricity to Buffalo. Tesla was upbeat andpositive, but being around large machinery and noise made him fidgety withanxiety. He was eager to return to his New York laboratory.At midnight on November 16, 1896, the switch was thrown that delivered the firstpower to reach Buffalo, some 22 miles away. Tesla was not there to witness themoment of success, which was a dream come true. As a boy 30 years earlier, hehad predicted that he would utilize Niagara Falls for the transmission of power.Image [images/p093-001.jpg]The success brought Tesla resounding fame but little profit. Practically everymajor newspaper and magazine in the country lauded Tesla's achievement as one ofthe most outstanding engineering accomplishments in history. On January 12,1897, he returned to Niagara and was sumptuously feted at a banquet in his honorby hundreds of dignitaries, luminaries, and investors in the project.Electricity would soon be lighting up homes, factories, and businesses large andsmall, as well as powering machinery, rail, and subway systems in Chicago andNew York.Image [images/p093-002.jpg]In due course, Lord Kelvin, who had been a strong proponent of DC for theNiagara project, would concede the advantages of AC for long-distancedistribution. “Tesla has contributed more to electrical science than any man upto his time,” he declared.If the Chicago World's Fair had marked the end of the War of the Currents, theharnessing of Niagara Falls sealed Tesla's victory.DREAMING BIGAs he accrued more publicity, Tesla's social circle widened even further andwith it more women clamored to meet this tall, striking gentleman with theContinental airs, exotic accent, and dapper attire. In today's vernacular, youcould say he knew how to work a room, flirt with the ladies, and always spark aconversation. Was it all a mask? Was he playing the bon vivant to attractinvestors? Women?By all accounts, Tesla's true comfort zone was the laboratory. His devotion toresearch and invention stood well above female entanglements. Financial supportwas most critical to his efforts. While everyone from Westinghouse to theinvestors in the Niagara project were basking in their success and calculatingthe wealth they would accrue from their investment, Tesla was, as ever,struggling to finance his next great idea. He was at a crossroads. How could hefind backers to develop a wireless transmission system when some of the richestmen in America had just poured money into a wired transmission system?Notwithstanding the consultations on the Niagara Falls project and thedisastrous fire at his lab, Tesla had been following the path of his dreams.Much of this was driven by his belief that he could derive energy from the Earthitself. During the intervening years he would do pioneering investigative workon X-rays, earthquakes, Martians, radio, robots, and the wireless transmissionof energy.Image [images/p094-001.jpg]X-RAYSIn 1894, Tesla took some long exposure pictures of Mark Twain with the aid ofvarious phosphorescent tubes. Unfortunately Tesla's research in this area wasdestroyed by the laboratory fire in 1895. That December, when German physicistWilhelm Conrad Röntgen announced his discovery of X-rays, Tesla remembered thathe had salvaged one failed photo from the Twain session. Rather than a pictureof the famous author, the image on the glass photographic plate included shadowsof the circular lens and the screws on the front of the wooden camera. Thisimage had been captured before the lens cap had been removed for exposure tolight.Upset by Röntgen's announcement, Tesla destroyed the evidence of his work.Gentleman that he was, he granted Röntgen full credit for the invention of theX-ray even though he clearly had produced an earlier example of the process.Tesla communicated with Röntgen over the course of the next year regarding waysto improve X-rays. He went so far as to self-administer X-rays to his variousbody parts for potential healing properties, calling the images “shadowgraphs.”Although he noticed burns on his skin and abandoned the practice, he maintainedthat the repeated application of X-rays would have no long-term effects. Thedamaging effects of radiation were still unknown at the time. As a number ofpowerful electrical companies began vying for Röntgen's attention, Teslaabandoned his efforts to improve the X-ray process.EARTHQUAKESWhen Tesla sent Mark Twain scurrying for bathroom relief by submitting him tothe gyrations of high-frequency oscillators, he had set the stage for futureexplorations in the transmission of wireless energy. In the years that followed,Tesla returned continually to investigating the phenomenon produced bymechanical oscillators.In 1898, he reasoned that he could tune his electronic circuits in such a waythat the electricity would vibrate in resonance with its circuits—much the waystrings vibrate on a musical instrument. Similarly, Tesla visualized mechanicalvibrations building up resonance conditions to produce effects of tremendousmagnitude on physical objects.To test his theory, he attached a small mechanical oscillator to an iron pillaron the upper floor of his Houston Street laboratory. As the oscillations wereincreased, he noticed that certain objects around the room began to vibrate asthey came into the same resonance. Tesla described the phenomenon as a “minorearthquake.” In fact, the oscillator attached to the iron pillar sent increasingvibrations down through building, into the ground below, and radiating out indifferent directions with ever-greater force. This was indeed similar to anearthquake, in which the epicenter is calm but the outer reaches experiencegreater force and destruction.Unbeknownst to Tesla at the moment of his test, at Police Headquarters on nearbyMulberry Street, chairs began to move of their own accord, objects slid offdesks, plaster fell from the ceiling, water pipes burst, and windows shattered.Fearing an earthquake, but used to strange goings-on in the neighborhood, thepolice dashed to Tesla's lab. Upon their arrival, the courtly inventor wasquoted as saying,“Gentlemen, I am sorry, but you are just a trifle too late to witness myexperiment. I found it necessary to stop it suddenly and unexpectedly and in anunusual way just as you entered. If you will come around this evening I willhave another oscillator attached to this platform and each of you can stand onit. Now you must leave, for I have many things to do. Good day, gentlemen.”For Tesla, the earth-shaking oscillator test provided a window into his newscience of telegeodynamics. By utilizing certain vibrations, he theorized, hecould literally split the Earth in half. With the correct oscillation, not onlycould he deal with the transmission of powerful impulses through the Earth toproduce effects of large magnitude and distant points, but he could also todetect ore deposits far below the Earth's surface, enemy ships or submarines, oreven objects on Mars. Along similar lines, seismologists today are experimentingwith time-reversed oscillations to deter potential earthquakes.MARTIANSThe possibility of life on Mars held many Americans in its grip in themid-1890s. Among those intrigued by the idea—and eager to find out—was ColonelJohn Jacob Astor IV, one of the richest men in the world, as well as an investorin the Niagara Company. It was propitious that Tesla shared in this fascination.Astor had presented Tesla a copy of his science-fiction novel, A Journey inOther Worlds(1893), which the inventor had enjoyed. Astor himself found time toinvent various devices, such as a bicycle brake and an improved turbine engine.Tesla's remarks on signaling Mars might have seemed outlandish to the press, butthey forged a bond with Astor that would serve Tesla in the years ahead. “Ifthere are intelligent inhabitants of Mars or any other planet,” he declared, “itseems to me that we can do something to attract their attention.... I have hadthis scheme under consideration for five or six years.” Tesla's reasoning, itwill be noted, follows the line of his experiments in mechanical oscillation. AsTesla was quoted in The Electrical World (April 4, 1896), sending or receivingsignals from MarsImage [images/p096-001.jpg]... is the extreme application of this principle of the propagation of electricwaves. The same principle may he employed with good effect for the transmissionof news to all parts of the earth.... Every city on the globe could be on animmense ticker circuit, and a message sent from New York would be in England,Africa and Australia in an instant. What a grand thing it would be in times ofwar, epidemic, or panic in the money market!RADIOBefore the fire at South Fifth Avenue, Tesla would set up an oscillatingtransmitter in the lab and walk around New York with a receiver to see if itwould detect signals. Sometimes he received intermittent signals as far north asthe Gerlach Hotel on West 27th Street. After the lab was destroyed, whilecasting about for money and projects, he used some of his credit lines fromWestinghouse and Adams to outfit the Houston Street lab and continue wirelessresearch.Already in his 1893 lecture at the annual meeting of the National Electric LightAssociation in St. Louis, Tesla had laid out the essential components of a radiosystem: a transmitter and receiver, antenna, ground connection, and tuningdevice. That lecture was to be a prelude to more elaborate testing of wirelesstransmission. The one basic component he had omitted in St. Louis was a speaker,something Tesla would invent and incorporate later. (Among the many physicistsof the last quarter of the 19th century who worked on high-frequencyelectromagnetic vibrations in an effort to invent wireless communication wereGermany's Heinrich Rudolf Hertz; England's Sir Oliver Lodge, James ClerkMaxwell, and Sir William Crookes; and the young Italian, Guglielmo Marconi.)Image [images/p097-001.jpg]In New York around 1897, Tesla would take secret boat trips up the Hudson Riverwith a battery-operated receiver in hand. At distances of over 25 miles, hefound, he was able to receive a musical note in tune with the oscillationsgenerated from his Houston Street lab. Ecstatic at the discovery, he drew up hisfindings and on September 2, 1897, filed for the Patents 649,621 –TRANSMISSION-OF-ENERGY, issued March 15, 1900, and 645,576 – SYSTEM OFTRANSMISSION-OF-ELECTRICAL ENERGY, issued March 20, 1900.Image [images/p098-001.jpg]In the application for wireless transmission (649,621), Tesla discusses the needto transmit and receive signals over high altitudes and across unobstructeddistances, so that the terminals between transmitter and receiver are “of largesurface, formed or maintained by such means as a balloon at an elevationsuitable for the purposes of transmission. The practice of tethering balloons toan extreme height might prove impractical.” Therefore, he goes on to say,if there be high mountains in the vicinity the terminals should be at a greaterheight, and generally they should always be at an altitude much greater thanthat of the highest objects near them. Since by the means described practicallyany potential that is desired may be produced, the currents through the airstrata may be very small, thus reducing the loss in the air.Image [images/p099-001.jpg]It would take another few years for Tesla to lure John Jacob Astor to front himthe money to test out these theories in Colorado Springs.Guglielmo Marconi's first U.S. patent application for a radio, Number 763,772,was filed on November 10, 1900—months after Tesla's. The “Radio Wars” were on!During the next half-century, Marconi would be the major challenger to Tesla ingaining credit for the invention of the radio.ROBOTS (TELEAUTOMATONS)As always, Tesla was in dire need of money and finally acknowledged that heneeded to make a big splash to attract funding. Concurrent with his experimentsin wireless radio, he was working on remote-controlled boats. The moment couldnot have been more perfect to exploit this project. The USS Maine, a battleshipdeployed to protect Cuba and U.S. interests on the island from Spain,mysteriously exploded in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898. Implicating Spainin the explosion, the United States officially declared war on April 28, 1898.Tesla rushed to file Patent 613,809 – METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLINGMECHANISM OF MOVING VEHICLE OR VEHICLES on July 1, 1898, stating in hisapplication,I have invented certain new and useful improvements in methods of and apparatusfor controlling from a distance the operation of the propelling-engines, thesteering apparatus, and other mechanism carried by moving bodies or floatingvessels.This was his first foray into a field that he would come to call“teleautomation.” So novel was the application that the patent office sent anexaminer to inspect the boat in action in Tesla's lab. The patent was granted onNovember 8, 1898.With patent protection, Tesla was once again ready to amaze the public and lureinvestors. On December 8, 1898, in an exhibition at New York's Madison SquareGarden, he demonstrated his teleautomaton, or radio-controlled boat, to thepublic. The crowd responded with disbelief. To some witnesses, the boat moved bymagic, to others by telepathy. A few suspected a trained monkey was installed inthe boat, obeying Tesla's commands. In reality, he used a transmitter box tosend signals that shifted electrical contacts in the boat, adjusting the rudder,motor, and lighting.ROBOTSThe distinction between Tesla's boat (a radio-controlled mechanism) and a robotis that a robot is a man-made mechanical device that can move by itself, whosemotion is pre-arranged, planned, sensed, actuated, and controlled, and whosemoves are influenced by “programming.” Tesla's boat, as described in his patent,mimics a robot. It contains a sensing device that responds to instructions froma distant radio.The demonstration could not have come at a better time, as the Spanish-AmericanWar was at its height. Tesla saw an opportunity to sell a radio-controlledtorpedo to the U.S. Navy, but the idea was met with derision. Perhaps hismistake was trying to sell the weapon as a means of peace rather than war. Hereasoned as follows:These automata, controlled within the range of vision of the operator, were thefirst and rather crude steps in the evolution of the Art of Telautomatics....The next logical improvement was its application to automatic mechanisms beyondthe limits of vision and at great distance from the center of control.Tesla felt strongly that wars could be waged machine against machine. And thatwould be progress, he believed, because with automatons there would be nobloodshed. Tesla remained convinced that his idea for remote control wouldeventually catch on. Unfortunately, he would not live to see the day when hisprophecy would become a reality.THE LAP OF LUXURYIt was around this time that Tesla moved into Astor's recently completed WaldorfAstoria Hotel on Fifth Avenue. It was the epitome of opulence and luxury. Astortreated his friend with the highest esteem, according him such special amenitiesas his own dining table. But Tesla was broke and living off borrowed money. Hisresearch was at a standstill. His New York lab was too small and unsafe for thescale of his projects, and the electricity being generated at the time for thelighting, telegraph, telephone, and transportation systems mushrooming acrossManhattan interfered with the wireless transmission experiments he wished toconduct.Image [images/p101-001.jpg]Astor, who had been following Tesla's work closely, learned that he requiredfunds to continue his research and invested $100,000 in the Tesla ElectricCompany. Of this amount, $30,000 went to Tesla directly; the rest went to stockpurchases. The injection of money enabled Tesla to take advantage of an offer byLeonard E. Curtis of the Colorado Springs Electric Company to build a temporaryplant in that city. This would give Tesla an opportunity to conduct experimentson a gigantic scale. He would be provided with all the land and electrical powerhe needed for his work. And so, in May 1899, Tesla moved to Colorado Springs."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7FOLLIES ABOUNDBesides machinery for producing vibrations of the required power, we must havedelicate means capable of revealing the effects of feeble influences exertedupon the earth. For such purposes, too, I have perfected new methods. By theiruse we shall likewise be able, among other things, to detect at considerabledistance the presence of an iceberg or other object at sea. By their use, also,I have discovered some terrestrial phenomena still unexplained. That we can senda message to a planet is certain, that we can get an answer is probable: man isnot the only being in the Infinite gifted with a mind.—Nikola TeslaImage [images/p103-001.jpg]TESLA ARRIVED IN COLORADO SPRINGS on May 18, 1899. Ostensibly, Astor hadinvested in him to pursue improvements in fluorescent lighting. Instead ofadhering to Astor's wishes, Tesla was well into his plans for setting up amassive experiment on the wireless transmission of energy, light, andcommunication.With an auspicious welcome from the town's elite, Tesla settled into Room 207 atthe Alta Vista Hotel. He promptly instructed the staff to deliver 18 freshtowels to his room each morning. Both the room number and number of linens werein keeping with his obsession that they be divisible by three.COLORADO SPRINGS EXPERIMENTAL STATIONColorado Springs presented Tesla the opportunity to conduct his transmissiontests at 6,000 feet above sea level in a dry climate, atmospheric conditionsthat befitted his experiments. He would be away from the social obligations andprying press of New York. Indeed he would be able to work in secrecy. Uponarriving, he sent a request to his assistant back East, George Scherff to shipelectrical equipment and glass blown tubes from the New York laboratory.Image [images/p104-001.jpg]Not only did Leonard E. Curtis provide Tesla with the means to set up the lab;he also secured free electricity for the inventor. The actual plans for thebuilding had been kept secret until only a few days before Tesla arrived inColorado. Outside town, in a pasture with a view of Pikes Peak, Tesla'sodd-looking experimental facility was being constructed under the auspices oflocal carpenter Joseph Dozier. Tesla and Dozier shared an inclination to discussparanormal behavior and interplanetary communication.The main wooden lab measured 50-60 feet by 70-80 feet, and approximately 18 feethigh, with a roof that opened to the sky. A smaller space that served as anoffice jutted out from the front of lab. At first Tesla had planned to flyballoons to lift the wires for sending signals, but the balloons provedincapable of lifting such heavy weight.As an alternative, he erected a large wooden tower on the roof platform, with atelescopic copper pole through the center. This retractable device, topped by acopper ball 3 feet in diameter, measured nearly 200 feet when fully extended.The pole, which he referred to as his magnifying transmitter, rose from thelab's enormous Tesla coil, which he called his magnifying transformer. Overtime, these two terms came to be used interchangeably to describe the entiresystem.Tesla's lab looked extremely out of place on the prairie. Fencing was erectedwith signs that admonished, “KEEP OUT – GREAT DANGER.” This was no idle threat,as Tesla would soon be generating enough electrical power to kill an erranttrespasser instantly.Inside the main laboratory, all manner of transformers and condensers were setup upon their arrival from New York. Together with assistant Fritz Lowenstein,who also came out from New York, Tesla assembled what was then the world'slargest Tesla coil. The coil was basically a 6-foot outside circular wall thatwas approximately 50 feet in diameter. Straddling the top of the wall were acouple of interwoven thick cables, or windings. Taken together, this served asthe primary winding for his transformer. Within this ring were a number ofsecondary coils, wound with differing amounts of turns. At any given time, oneend of a secondary coil could be sent into the earth and the other end could beattached to the transmitting pole. In this fashion, Tesla could send differentwavelengths to his various receivers. By the time construction of the Tesla coilwas completed in mid-June, he could begin experimenting.Image [images/p106-001.jpg]MISSIONS ACCOMPLISHEDTesla wrote in his Colorado Springs diary that he had come to accomplish threemain goals: * Develop a transmitter of great power; * Perfect a means for individualizing and isolating the energy transmitted. * Ascertain the laws of propagation of currents through the Earth and the atmosphere.Through months of experimentation, he made a number of discoveries that led tothe realization of these goals. He was able to discover the Earth's electricalproperties, send messages through the ionosphere, and transmit energy greatdistances in three manners:1) THE EARTH'S ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES—STATIONARY WAVESWith his magnifying transmitter, Tesla could conduct experiments in wirelesscommunication and energy to any point on the globe. He would begin by measuringlightning discharges during storms and set up oscillations from his coil thatwere in harmony with the sparks of lightning. By varying his oscillations, hecould produce varying wavelengths that could be transmitted and received atdifferent frequencies. His apparatus thus led to the discovery of “stationary”waves in July 1899, which he explained as follows:When we raise the voice and hear an echo in reply, we know that the sound of thevoice must have reached a distant wall, or boundary, and must have beenreflected from the same. Exactly as the sound, so an electrical wave isreflected, and the same evidence which is afforded by an echo is offered by anelectrical phenomenon known as a “stationary' wave – that is, a wave with fixednodal and ventral regions [i.e. a sine wave]. Instead of sendingsound-vibrations toward a distant wall, I have sent electrical vibrations towardthe remote boundaries of the earth, and instead of the wall the earth hasreplied. In place of an echo I have obtained a stationary electrical wave, awave reflected from afar. (“The Problem of Increasing Human Energy”)2) SENDING MESSAGES THROUGH THE IONOSPHEREThe discovery of stationary waves and utilizing the conductive properties of theEarth meant that Tesla would be able to send messages much farther than hiscompetitor Marconi could. He was tapping into the Earth's geomagnetic pulse. Theionosphere would become Tesla's electrical highway for carrying energy from atransmitting tower to a receiving plant.Image [images/p107-001.jpg]In the process of make that discovery, Tesla's highly sensitive equipment alsobegan picking up rhythmic beeps. In a 1901 article for Collier's Weekly titled“Talking with Planets,” he would write:The changes I noted were taking place periodically, and with such a clearsuggestion of number and order that they were not traceable to any cause thenknown to me. I was familiar, of course, with such electrical disturbances as areproduced by the sun, Aurora Borealis and earth currents, and I was as sure as Icould be of any fact that these variations were due to none of these causes....It was some time afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind that thedisturbances I had observed might be due to an intelligent control. Although Icould not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them ashaving been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that Ihad been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.... I havenever ceased to think of those experiences and of the observations made inColorado. I am constantly endeavoring to improve and perfect my apparatus, andjust as soon as practicable I shall again take up the thread of myinvestigations at the point where I have been forced to lay it down for a time.(“Talking With the Planets”)In 1955, rhythmic one-two-three beeps were discovered to be emanating from theplanet Jupiter. Perhaps these were the sounds that Tesla had attributed tosignals from Mars, as suggested by research in the 1990s by electrical engineerJames F. Corum and his brother, physicist Kenneth L. Corum.3) TRANSMITTING ENERGYHaving paved the way for wireless communication, Tesla embarked on experimentsto transmit electricity wirelessly. He would take his receivers a considerabledistance from the lab, with Lowenstein left behind to throw the switch on thetransmitter at varying intervals. Tesla would report back when the receiversdetected energy. However, since Lowenstein was back in the lab, unable towitness what Tesla reported, there is no actual confirmation of theseexperiments.Sometime in early fall 1899, Lowenstein left for Europe. Tesla then summonedanother assistant from New York, Kolman Czito, who would remain with him wellinto old age for both men. Tesla would prepare Czito for some of his boldestexperiments.Wanting visual proof that his experiments were proving fruitful, Tesla contactedRobert Underwood Johnson to write an article for The Century, with photos todemonstrate his achievements in Colorado Springs. In late December 1899,photographer Dickenson Alley arrived from New York to shoot an astonishing setof photographs. One iconic image was achieved through the technique of multipleexposures. The photo depicts a seated Tesla reading a book amid hundreds ofstreamers of electricity streaking around him. If the photograph were shot inreal time, Tesla would have been electrocuted on the spot.Image [images/p109-001.jpg]For the boldest of experiments, Tesla and Czito planted numerous incandescentlamps in the fields beyond the laboratory. Upon Tesla's command, Czito threw thetransformer switches for a brief moment while Tesla stood in the lab doorway,observing huge bolts of electricity issuing from the top of the transmittingtower. The sound of millions of volts of streaming electricity wasthunderous—then everything went silent. Tesla's experiment had short-circuitedthe power at the Colorado Springs Electric Company's generating station,plunging the surrounding community into complete darkness.The disaster contributed to Tesla's departure from Colorado Springs. He was onceagain in debt, with a stack of outstanding bills. The Johnsons entreated him toreturn to New York for the Christmas holidays. Tesla was anxious to do so butwas not be able to depart until January 7, 1900.BACK IN NEW YORKIronically, when Tesla arrived back in New York, Marconi was also theresoliciting funds for his wireless system. Marconi's confidant was the Serbianphysicist Michael Pupin, who had worked with Edison in challenging Tesla's ACpatent. Now, in early 1900, Pupin succeeded in bringing Tesla and Marconitogether for an uncomfortable meeting at Tesla's lab to pick each other'sbrains. Tesla was confident that he possessed the ability to transmit messagesaround the globe. Marconi didn't believe him. The upshot of the meeting was thatPupin gained an understanding of Tesla's theories and pirated the principles inorder to gain employment with Marconi. Pupin and Marconi's machinations wouldplay out negatively against Tesla in the years ahead.Image [images/p110-001.jpg]Tesla was less concerned with Marconi's current experiments than with the needto secure investments for a massive broadcast and power transmitter that wouldcapitalize on his Colorado Springs experiments. He faced the same conundrum ashe had with his invention of the AC induction motor. Without the support systemand acumen of previous patronage, he would have to go it alone—devise his ownstrategy for filing patents, promote his wireless transmission system, andgarner interested investors. Years earlier it was sufficient to produce workingmotors that introduced his AC ideas to the world. Now in 1900 his theories wereon a global scale. The stakes were much higher, and the dollar amount would haveto be much higher as well.In order to protect his Colorado Springs findings, Tesla set about drawing upand filing a set of four important patents between mid-May and mid- July, 1900.The first one was easily the most brilliant, in which Tesla set forth hisdiscovery and utilization of stationary waves to transmit power and sendmessages through the earth (Patent 787,412 – ART OF TRANSMITTING ELECTRICALENERGY THROUGH THE NATURAL MEDIUM).Image [images/p111-001.jpg]Tesla's efforts to interest the U.S. Navy in the teleautomation torpedo andwireless communication systems met with bureaucratic rejection. His repeatedattempts to obtain new investments from John Jacob Astor were greeted by a wallof stony silence. George Westinghouse was uninterested in wireless projects butdid extend Tesla a few thousand dollars in credit. Even Tesla's appeals to theNew York elite at his usual haunts—the Player's Club, Delmonico's, and thelike—failed to rouse backers.“THE PROBLEM OF INCREASING HUMAN ENERGY”With no practical inventions to show for his Colorado Springs experiments, Teslawas hard-pressed to find financial backers for future development in wirelesstransmission. The lack of anything practical to demonstrate was problematic. Theyears between Tesla's initial AC-driven motors and the turn of the century gaverise to a host of well-trained electrical engineers and a myriad of inventorswho profited greatly from Tesla's initial discoveries. Less apparent toinvestors in 1900 were the benefits to be gained from a system that wouldtransmit energy wirelessly.While filing his wireless patents, therefore, it was important for Tesla todecide how to promote his theories in order to attract potential investors.Thomas Commerford Martin, who had been instrumental in arranging earlierpresentations to the electrical engineering community, no longer could be reliedon, as he was skeptical of Tesla's grand predictions. The other alternative wasfor Tesla to appeal directly to the public in the hope of luring investors.Gambling on the latter approach, he wrote a long article in florid language thatdescribed the global implications of his magnifying transmitter. It wasdesigned, he declared, to solve all the world's energy needs. After much giveand take, Tesla convinced Robert Underwood Johnson to publish his treatise, “TheProblem of Increasing Human Energy,” in the June 1900 issue of Century Magazine.Running more than 70 pages, the article was accompanied by startling photographsof Colorado Springs and Tesla's automaton.Image [images/p112-001.jpg]J.P. MORGAN'S $$$$$$$Tesla's treatise in Century Magazine, interwoven with his ramblings on lastingpeace, harnessing the sun's energy, and interplanetary communication, provedhighly provocative. Members of the public greeted his idea of a World WirelessSystem as visionary, but the scientific community was less than enthusiastic.The lengthy essay failed to attract investors, though it might have piqued theinterest of the richest man in America, J. Pierpont Morgan. Among the ideas thatintrigued him was a magnifying transmitter capable of locating ships at sea andtransmitting their position back to the mainland. The prospect appealed toMorgan, who was a yachtsman. Indeed his own negotiations with Marconi for asecure system had failed.Image [images/p113-001.jpg]Tesla and Morgan both had close social ties with the Robert and KatharineJohnson, at whose social gatherings the inventor and industrialist appearedtogether over the ensuing months. Morgan, who had invested in the Niagaraproject, was well aware of Tesla's success with it. No doubt Tesla got Morgan'sear about the telegraphy system he proposed that would broadcast securely overmultiple wavelengths, compared with Marconi's single-wavelength system. Theseries of discussions and entreating letters from Tesla finally moved the tycoonto hand Tesla a check for $150,000. In return, Morgan received a 51% share ofTesla's lighting and wireless patent rights.Morgan's $150,000 was little more than pocket change for an industrialist whosenet worth in the steel industry alone ran into a billion dollars. Tesla wasexcited that he could move ahead with his plans to build a wireless telegraphysystem, but perhaps he misconstrued the arrangement with Morgan as the beginningof a bigger, longer-term partnership. With the thousands of dollars it took tolight the Chicago Exposition and the millions of dollars it took to complete theNiagara project, Tesla could hardly have expected to accomplish his goal of awireless telegraphy system with the initial funding from Morgan. His grandioseplans for a completely wireless world broadcasting transmission system wouldrequire much more.Image [images/p113-002.jpg]WARDENCLYFFEMorgan's commitment enabled Tesla to negotiate with banker and lawyer James S.Warden for a 200-acre tract of Warden's land on Long Island, New York.Portraying the yet-to-be-built transmission system as the centerpiece ofWarden's utopian real-estate enterprise, Tesla convinced him to deed over theparcel of land. Today this part of Long Island is known as East Shoreham; backthen the projected development was named Wardenclyffe.Tesla was able to enlist the services of his architect friend Stanford White,the designer of the power plant at Niagara Falls, to draw up architectural plansfor a two-story laboratory and powerhouse that still stands on the site today.The tower itself was designed and constructed by White's associate, W.D. Croweof East Orange, New Jersey. Construction began in September 1901. Tesla woulddescribe the tower as187 feet high, having a spherical terminal about 68 feet in diameter. Thesedimensions were adequate for the transmission of virtually any amounts ofenergy.... The transmitter was to emit a wave-complex of special characteristicsand I had devised a unique method of telephonic control of any amount of energy.(My Inventions)Image [images/p114-001.jpg]Theoretically, the transmission tower would send signals wirelessly through theEarth, which acts as a conducting body, to a receiver anywhere around the globe.During construction, Tesla would commute by railroad each day from his residenceat the Waldorf Astoria, along with a servant who carried a lavish lunch preparedby the hotel's staff. They would arrive at 11:00 A.M. and depart at 3:30 P.M.after Tesla's supervision of the day's construction.As the laboratory neared completion and equipment arrived from the HoustonStreet lab, Tesla took up residence in a nearby bungalow for a year. Outfittingthe lab was particularly stressful for him, with delays in the manufacture andshipment of machinery and irregular intervals in the receipt of money fromMorgan.ERECTING THE TOWERThe proposed tower would be located 350 feet from the laboratory in order toprotect its occupants from errant streams of lightning emanating from themushroom-shaped top. The new tower posed a number of design and engineeringproblems. First, no wooden structures of this height that employed minimal metalhad ever been built before. The top of the tower was so large that it would actas a sail in stiff winds and easily topple the entire structure. When finallycompleted in 1902, the tower loomed high over the Wardenclyffe facility like abizarre erector set topped by a huge mushroom.In order for Tesla to achieve the objective of transmitting electrical powerthrough the Earth, he reasoned that he would need a ground connection from thetransmitting tower. To this end, he sank a 10-foot by twelve-foot well 120 feetunder the tower and below the water table. Then, to complete the ground, heconnected a metal shaft from the mushroom cap of the tower to the bottom of thewell. An elaborate system was also necessary to properly connect the primarycoils and the magnifying transmitter's secondary coil. Patent 1,119,732 –APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING ELECTRICAL ENERGY provided an illustration andprinciples for Wardenclyffe Tower.The big question was would it work?Complicating matters, Marconi claimed to have sent the three-dot, Morse codesignal “SSS” across the Atlantic on December 12–13, 1901, heralded in The NewYork Times. Thomas Commerford Martin switched his allegiance from Tesla toMarconi, arranging for the latter to address the AIEE about his accomplishment.Tesla brushed off the announcement with a glib rejoinder: Marconi was merelysending signals, whereas he would be able to transmit electrical powerwirelessly.Image [images/p116-001.jpg]Morgan, also sensing that Marconi was ahead of Tesla in creating a wirelesstelegraphy system, felt little motivation to provide Tesla with additionalfunding. Moreover, Tesla had not lived up to his contract with Morgan to delivera transatlantic telegraphy system. Indeed, Tesla had hoodwinked Morgan intobelieving that he was building the communication system while in fact he wasworking on his wireless energy dream.Nor was Marconi the only inventor whose publicity campaign pushed him ahead ofTesla. Other notable entrants in the field included Elihu Thomson, MichaelPupin, and rival wireless inventor Lee de Forest, who made major innovations inbroadcasting and sound-on-film development. All of their advances werefundamentally inspired by Tesla's discoveries.In 1902, Tesla stepped up his entreaties to Morgan to pour more money into theWardenclyffe enterprise. In a series of earnest letters to the financier, Teslaappealed to Morgan's vanity and business instincts. Tesla outlined a “WorldTelegraphy System” for which Morgan could potentially reap great profits fromall the receivers that would have to be built around the world.It makes possible not only the instantaneous and precise wireless transmissionof any kind of signals, messages or characters, to all parts of the world, butalso the inter-connection of the existing telegraph, telephone, and other signalstations without any change in their present equipment. By its means, forinstance, a telephone subscriber here may call up and talk to any othersubscriber on the Globe. An inexpensive receiver, not bigger than a watch, willenable him to listen anywhere, on land or sea, to a speech delivered or musicplayed in some other place, however distant. (My Inventions)Was this just grandiose boasting?No matter what, Tesla drove himself to complete as much of the tower aspossible. He had to begin testing in order to prove the viability of hisconcept. The New York Sun reported on July 16, 1903:Natives hereabouts are intensely interested in the nightly electrical displayshown from the tall tower where Nikola is conducting his experiments in wirelesstelegraphy and telephony. For a time, the air was filled with blinding streaksof electricity traveling through the darkness on some mysterious errand.Morgan, for his part, was too deeply involved in his own myriad interests in theshipping, steel, and railroad industries to pay much attention to Tesla. Theinventor's incessant pleas for money eventually became full of vituperation andanger toward the industrial baron. Morgan flatly refused to become involved inany more of Tesla's schemes; the great enterprise at Wardenclyffe still had notdemonstrated the ability to turn a profit. In all probability, the manyspeculators then entering the broadcast field also contributed to Tesla'sdiminished creditability. Although Morgan now viewed him as a poor risk, Teslastill believed thatthe true rewards are ever in proportion to the labor and sacrifices made.... Ifeel certain that of all my inventions, the Magnifying Transmitter will provemost important and valuable to future generations. I am promoted to thisprediction not so much by thoughts of commercial and industrial revolution whichit will surely bring about, but of the humanitarian consequences of the manyachievements it makes possible. (My Inventions)BROKE AND BROKENWithout Morgan's capital and endorsement, Tesla went into a downward spiral. Asmuch as he tried to keep working, the bills mounted and his creditors besiegedhim. His debts in Colorado Springs had not been fulfilled. He could not payWestinghouse for the dynamos and other machinery loaned to him on credit. Hiscurrent employees were going without pay and began to leave. Before long, onlyhis loyal assistant George Scherff remained to help with the research. Even thatcame to a halt when Tesla could no longer pay for the coal to fuel the boilers.Financially overwhelmed and psychologically overcome, Tesla was forced toabandon Wardenclyffe in late summer 1905. He apparently suffered a completenervous breakdown, clinging to his vision for world wireless energy. He returnedto New York City to live on credit at the Waldorf Astoria.Image [images/p118-001.jpg]Tesla's personal world underwent further transformation in the succeeding yearswith the passing of some of the important figures in his life. Stanford White,who had designed both the Niagara Falls and Wardenclyffe powerhouses, wasfamously murdered by Harry K. Thaw over a lover's dispute with showgirl EvelynNesbitt in 1906. Mark Twain would succumb in 1910. John Jacob Astor was lost inthe sinking of the Titanic in 1912. George Westinghouse passed on two yearslater.Besieged by creditors, Tesla resorted to desperate measures. To guaranteepayment of his hotel bills, he gave two mortgages on Wardenclyffe to theproprietor of the Waldorf Astoria, George C. Boldt. Unable to make any paymentsat all, Tesla turned over the full deed in 1915.Wardenclyffe would be Tesla's last undertaking of such magnitude. While thetower had a futuristic science-fiction aspect, he left no clear plans ordescription of the full operating system."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8RIDING THE ROLLER COASTER: NEW INVENTIONS, BANKRUPTCY, HONORSImage [images/p121-001.jpg]You propose to honor me with a medal which I could pin upon my coat and strutfor a vain hour before the members and guests of your [AIEE] Institute.... Andwhen you would go through the vacuous pantomime of honoring Tesla you would notbe honoring Tesla but Edison who has previously shared unearned glory from everyprevious recipient of this [Edison] medal.—Nikola TeslaTHE DEMISE OF THE WARDENCLYFFE PROJECT was unbearable for Tesla. Dodgingcreditors, getting by on small loans from friends and assistant George Scherff,and the inability to pursue the tangle of patent infringements from which othersbenefited all left Tesla bereft. Scherff coaxed him repeatedly to develop someminor inventions that could be marketed for profit. Tesla, still obsessed withimproving the world on a grand scale, could not be bothered with such trifles.He continued to seek funding, but the Panic of 1907 sent potential investors inother directions. The moneyed elite were more interested in saving their owninstitutions.Image [images/p122-001.jpg]PERSEVERINGSeeking relief from his mental anguish, Tesla would secretly journey out to theabandoned Wardenclyffe site. There, on the brink of tears, he wouldself-administer electric shock therapy.Although the waning days of Wardenclyffe signaled the death knell to Tesla'sWorld Telegraphy System, it did not leave him with a dearth of new ideas. Hefinally scraped together rent money for a tiny office in the Singer SewingMachine Building at 165 Broadway (today the site of 1 Liberty Plaza). Togenerate a modest income, he wrote a series of visionary articles with a tonethat was alternately passionate and embittered. For wasn't he the greatdiscoverer of AC and the inventor of the AC induction motor, fluorescent lamps,remote control, wireless telegraphy, and a host of other electronicimprovements? Shouldn't investors flock to underwrite his ideas?With no benefactors forthcoming, he realized he needed a different strategy.TURBINESDuring the dark days of his recovery, Tesla's interests reverted back to hischildhood memories of flying. While the Wright Brothers had initiated the era ofhuman-powered flight in 1903 with a lightweight gas engine, Tesla believed thatairplane engines had to be lighter, smaller, and subject to less friction. Healso sought to eliminate propellers, which themselves increased resistance topropulsion.Borrowing again from the thinking that led to his invention of the AC inductionmotor, Tesla would return to another childhood memory—that of a spinningwaterwheel in a flowing river. Just as the back-and-forth rotating magneticfield played a prominent role in his AC motor, he realized, so the flow of fluidcould proceed in his bladeless turbine.Technically we think of a turbine engine as essentially a shaft with fanlikeblades. Applying pressure to the blades causes the shaft to turn at a highspeed, generating power. To Tesla's mind, however, the technology is inefficientbecause the blades themselves create a resistant force. To overcome thisadditional resistance, Tesla explored the principles of viscosity and adhesion.He eliminated the blades and arranged a series of closely packed parallel metaldisks mounted on a shaft within a sealed chamber. When water or compressed airentered the chamber and passed between the disks, the disks turned. That rotatedthe shaft. Because the fluids have viscosity and all fluids molecularly adhereto solids, the movement of the water along the surfaces of the disks caused thedisks to rotate. If the fluid entered at the center of the turbine and goes outthe periphery, the turbine acted as a pump. If the fluid entered at theperiphery and exited out at the center, the turbine acted as a motor. Thus, theturbine could be an efficient engine or a switch for powering a pump orcompressors, for running automobiles and aircraft.Working with Julius Czito, the son of his former assistant at Colorado Springs,Tesla produced their first turbine prototype in 1906. The motor weighed lessthan 50 pounds and was able to deliver 110 horsepower. Tesla would describe thissmall but highly efficient turbine as a “powerhouse in a hat.” The workings ofthe invention are described in Tesla Patent 1,061,206 – TURBINE, filed in 1909.In an interview with The Washington Post, Tesla called the bladeless turbine“the greatest of my inventions.... Here you have a new power for pumps, steamengines, gasoline motors, for automobiles, for airships, for many other uses,and all so simple.”Image [images/p123-001.jpg]One problem with the design was that the metallurgic materials available to himat the time could not withstand the rigors of the fluids applied to them andthus would distort the parallel disks. Thus, if he were to produce a turbinethat measured up to his exacting standards, he would need money for furtherresearch. Fortunes had already been invested in existing turbines, however, sothere was little impetus for capitalists to change the status quo. And so, onceagain, Tesla had developed an invention that would have far-reachingimplications for industry and the benefit of mankind, but once again he facedfinancial obstacles and derision.Image [images/p124-001.jpg]SPEEDOMETERSAlthough the turbine proved unsuccessful as a motor in his lifetime, Tesla wasable to attract some manufacturing interest in the use of his invention as apump. In particular, the Waltham Watch Company saw his research as potentiallybeneficial in the manufacture of precision instruments. Waltham's seed money leddirectly to Tesla's invention of the speedometer, whose key principle hesuccinctly described in Patent 1,274,816 – SPEED-INDICATOR:Image [images/p125-001.jpg]I have described a new type of speed measuring instrument wherein the adhesionand viscosity of a gaseous medium, preferably air, is utilized fortorque-transmission from a primary driving to a secondary pivoted andtorsionally restrained member under conditions such that the rotary effortexerted upon the latter is linearly proportional to the rate of rotation of theformer. The principles of that invention find place in my present construction[the speedometer].Unfortunately for Tesla, the patent granted in 1918 was assigned to the WalthamWatch Company. With his customary lack of business sense, Tesla came away withnothing after years of research and development. Today, Tesla's bladelesscorrosion-defying pump is widely used as a means of pumping fluids in oil fieldsand retrieving viscous materials that contain solids other pumps can't handle.FLYING STOVES, FLIVVERS, AND VTOLSWith renewed confidence if not financial stability, Tesla rented office space inthe Metropolitan Life Tower on Madison Square.Image [images/p125-002.jpg]Image [images/p126-001.jpg]FLIVVEREarly 20th-century slang term for a cheap, mass-produced automobile; it couldalso be applied to a similarly crude, rough-riding airplane of the day.Boldly predicting that jet planes would be the aircraft of the future and thathis bladeless turbine would power them, Tesla courted John Jacob Astor becauseof his interest in flight. Astor saw through the ruse. Behind Tesla's appeallurked the inventor's intention to develop wireless energy and propel anelectric turbine with power supplied from stations around the world. Astorrefused investment capital, as did George Westinghouse.Given his propensity for hyperbole, Tesla told one Westinghouse employee, “Youshould not be at all surprised if some day you see me fly from New York toColorado Springs in a contrivance which will resemble a gas stove and weigh asmuch.” Tesla's flying machine was to be an improvement of Henry Ford's Model-Tof the air called the “flying flivver.”Even without funding from Astor or Westinghouse, Tesla for years continued histheoretical research into a flying machine that could be powered by hisbladeless turbine. In Patent 1,655,114 – APPARATUS FOR AERIAL TRANSPORTATION,filed October 7, 1927, he detailed his proposal:The invention consists of a new type of flying machine, designated“helicopter-plane”, which may be raised and lowered vertically and drivenhorizontally by the same propelling devices and comprises: a prime mover ofimproved design and an airscrew, both especially adapted for the purpose, meansfor tilting the machine in the air, arrangements for controlling its operationin any position, a novel landing gear and other constructive details, all ofwhich will be hereinafter fully described.Image [images/p127-001.jpg]As with so many other of his ideas, Tesla was stymied in his efforts to raisemoney for a prototype of his “helicopter-plane.” The patent was granted onJanuary 3, 1928, but it would be his last. Though he never lived to see it, hisaircraft was a precursor to today's VTOLs (vertical takeoff and landing planes).Eventually helicopters and a vast array of military fighter planes would bebuilt as initially suggested by Tesla.HOVERCRAFTTesla's horseshoe-crab-shaped VTOL is said to have resembled a Corvette thatrose up and road along the ground on a layer of air. The idea inherent in thisinvention found its way into today's Harrier jump jet fighter planes andair-cushioned vehicles (ACVs), or hovercraft, used to transport people andequipment over bodies of water, including the English Channel.RADARTesla's vision did not stop with aircraft, of course. His mind was never atrest, inspired by changing needs as much as by spontaneous invention. Theoutbreak of World War I in Europe compelled him to act in the cause of dualpatriotism. He was a U.S. citizen but still proud of his Serbian background andwished to contribute to the efforts against the aggressor Austria-Hungary. As apacifist, he felt that any invention should be a means for ending war.Relying on his previous discovery of stationary waves, Tesla conceived a meansof locating German U-boats (submarines) with a technology that anticipatedunderwater radar. He made the following prediction in the August 1917 issue ofElectrical Experimenter:Now we are coming to the method of locating such hidden metal masses assubmarines by an electric ray.... That is the thing which seems to hold greatpromises. If we can shoot out a concentrated ray comprising a stream of minuteelectric charges vibrating electrically at tremendous frequency, say millions ofcycles per second, and then intercept this ray, after it has been reflected by asubmarine hull for example, and cause this intercepted ray to illuminate afluorescent screen (similar to the X-ray method) on the same or another ship,then our problem of locating the hidden submarine will have been solved.Insurmountable technical problems prevented the development of Tesla's systemfor the time being, but by World War II the military had developed sonardetection methods that were a viable alternative to Tesla's electric wavetheory.BANKRUPTCYWith all of his discoveries during this period, Tesla maintained the outwardappearance of a rich man. This, like his bon vivant persona, was contrary to thefact of the situation. Tesla borrowed money from J.P. Morgan's son Jack, but itwas not enough to keep his enterprises afloat and he repeatedly failed to meethis debts. Tesla's finances were on a precipitous roller coaster during theyears 1912–1916.His public image and need for funding demanded that Tesla move his office to aprestige location. He chose the Woolworth Building, then the tallest building inthe world. He moved into the space in 1914 but was unable to pay the rent andmoved to 8 West 40th Street, across the street from the New York Public Libraryand Bryant Park.Tesla's finances came unraveled when he was summoned to court in 1916 for hisinability to pay the city $935 in personal taxes. Tesla revealed that he livedat the Waldorf Astoria, but mostly on credit. His company had no assets, and hereceived only enough royalties on his patents to pay for basic expenses. He hadscores of debts and more than five proceedings against him still pending. He wasowed no money, had nothing in the bank, and had no personal assets. The courtappointed a receiver to handle his financial affairs.He was publicly disgraced, his credibility called into question.If bankruptcy wasn't Tesla's final indignation, the dynamiting of his belovedWardenclyffe Tower on July 4, 1917, precipitated another near breakdown. Rumorsabounded that the U.S. Government razed the tower under the suspicion that itwas being used to send messages to German U-boats off the coast. The real reasonwas that the mortgage holder, Waldorf Astoria proprietor George C. Boldt, neededto destroy the tower in order to make the property more saleable. The tower'sremains were salvaged for scrap.Image [images/p129-001.jpg]With many of his closest friends and associates dead by this time, Tesla waswell on his way to becoming a recluse. His feelings toward humanity would onlyharden.NOBELISTSWhen Marconi first sent a wireless telegraph signal across the Atlantic Ocean in1901, Otis Pond, an engineer then working for Tesla, commented, “Looks as ifMarconi got the jump on you.” Tesla replied, “Marconi is a good fellow. Let himcontinue. He is using seventeen of my patents.” Marconi would go on to win the1909 Nobel Prize in Physics (jointly with Karl Ferdinand Braun) for hiscontributions to the development of wireless telegraphy.Image [images/p130-001.jpg]Tesla would never get over being usurped by Marconi. On August 4, 1915, Teslasued the Marconi Corporation for copyright infringement but was financiallyunable to pursue the claim. Adding insult to injury, the New York Times onNovember 7 inexplicably reported that Tesla and Edison were to share the 1915Nobel Prize. Tesla, who had not received official confirmation, was quoted asfollows:I believe that ultimately all battles, if they should come, will be waged byelectrical waves instead of explosives.... I have concluded that the honor hasbeen conferred upon me in acknowledgment of a discovery announced a short timeago which concerns the transmission of electrical energy without wires.Image [images/p131-002.jpg]Tesla, the article went on, “said he thought Mr. Edison was worthy of a dozenNobel Prizes” but “knew new nothing of the discovery that induced theauthorities in Sweden to confer the great honor on Mr. Edison.” With hiscustomary irony, Tesla was actually saying that Edison was not in his league fordiscovery. Robert and Katharine Johnson expressed congratulations, but there waslittle elation on Tesla's part. If there was, it was dashed a week later whenthe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that William Henry Bragg and hisson, William Lawrence Bragg, had in fact won the year's Nobel Prize for Physics.This was not the last time Tesla would be snubbed by the Nobel Committee, whileat least four other scientists were awarded the prize in Tesla's lifetime fordiscoveries that were initially his.Image [images/p131-001.jpg]THE EDISON MEDALWhile neither Tesla nor Edison would ever win a Nobel Prize, the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), perhaps to make amends for the SwedishAcademy's oversight, nominated Tesla for its highest award, the Edison Medal, in1916.B.A. Behrend, a fellow engineer and longtime champion of Tesla's AC theories,brought him the good news and was designated as the presenter of the award at aforthcoming AIEE banquet. Tesla at first refused Behrend's overtures, seethingat the indignities that been heaped upon him for decades. The medal, he felt,was small consolation.After countless entreaties, Tesla finally acquiesced. Attired in white tie andtails, he attended the banquet in his honor at the Engineers Club in Manhattanon May 19, 1917, addressing the attendees in his customary joking, charmingmanner. But when it came time to cross the street for the formal awardpresentation at the United Engineering Societies building, Tesla was nowhere tobe found. After a frantic search, Behrend finally found him in nearby BryantPark, along 40th Street, still in formal attire and surrounded by a crowd. Hisarms were raised like Saint Francis of Assisi, draped with pigeons. With a silkhandkerchief drawn from his jacket pocket, he gently shooed away the pigeons andstrode with Behrend to the auditorium to accept the Edison Medal.Tesla gave a resounding, circumlocutory speech on Edison's virtues and describedhis own machine for changing the weather. Then, inexplicably, Tesla announcedthat his dream of wireless energy transmission had become a reality. “Recently,”he said, “I have obtained a patent on a transmitter with which it is practicableto transfer unlimited amounts of energy to any distance.”It would not be the first time or last time that Tesla was lost among thepigeons. Strange smells were rumored to be emanating from his hotel room, withpigeon droppings lining the window sills. Tesla had also been spotted feedingpigeons at the nearby New York Public Library and St. Patrick's Cathedral.Image [images/p132-001.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9ENDINGSImage [images/p133-001.jpg]KATHARINE JOHNSON'S DEATH IN 1925 contributed further to Tesla's estrangementfrom society. Her letters had given him a sense of connection and being caredfor; now he retreated into his communion with pigeons. According to friend andbiographer John O'Neill, he singled out one in particular:a beautiful bird, pure white with light gray tips on its wings; that one wasdifferent. It was a female. I would know that pigeon anywhere.... No matterwhere I was that pigeon would find me; when I wanted her I had only to call herand she would come flying to me. She understood me and I understood her.... Iloved that pigeon, I loved her as a man loves a woman, and she loved me... Aslong as I had her, there was a purpose in my life. (O'Neill, Prodigal Genius:The Life of Nikola Tesla)But even the pigeons would become a cause of consternation. Not only would Teslahave to move from hotel to hotel for not paying his bills, but the accumulationof pigeon excrement around his rooms motivated hotel proprietors to evict him.His possessions—dozens of trunks containing documents, correspondence,theoretical papers, and invention models—were carted from one storage facilityto another.Image [images/p134-001.jpg]Tesla valued his privacy and could be curt with hotel employees, ordering themto remain at least three feet from him. Then, broke but contrite, he wouldgenerously tip hotel staff in order to make amends for his brusk manners.HERALDING THE FUTUREWith his days as an inventor behind him, Tesla found solace in his pigeons andindulged his eccentricities. He had always been a fastidious dresser, but by the1930s his clothes were largely out of fashion, a throwback to another era. Hisfear of germs became the stuff of gossip. Meanwhile, Tesla was living off atrickle of royalties from the speedometer, some motors, and published articles.Eventually the Westinghouse Corporation agreed to pay him a monthly consultingfee and cover his hotel rent.Tesla was back in the spotlight on July 20, 1931, when his picture graced thecover of Time magazine to mark his 75th birthday. The accompanying article setthe tone for greeting reporters who would flock to him on subsequent birthdays.Tesla did not disappoint, making astonishing predictions for the future.Image [images/p135-001.jpg]Pigeons were not the only flights of fancy for the aging Nikola Tesla. Hecontinued to believe that his inventions could serve the good of all humankind.He believed that being able to communicate with pigeons was of a higher order.Similarly he felt that when he signaled other planets he reached other lifeforms. If he were able to signal other planets, he believed then he should beable to signal humans globally in the same fashion. Communication distancesbetween all inhabitants would be shortened. With improved communication, theworld would be a better place. Differences between peoples could be overcome. Asa man of peace he believed wars could be avoided through improved communicationTransmitting wireless energy across the solar system held a grip on histhinking. He issued pronouncements on cosmic rays, transmitting mechanicalenergy, and particle beam weaponry, reasoning that if he could developinventions in these areas then wars would no longer be necessary. Machines wouldsettle any differences. From the 1930s to his death, Tesla claimed to haveinvented a “peace ray,” a particle-beam projector he called a teleforce. Thefanciful weapon was thought of instead as a “death ray,” a reputation heattempted to dispel in an interview for an October 1934 article in Every Weekmagazine, “Dr. Tesla Visions the End of Aircraft in War.”The beam, intended chiefly for defense, will be projected from an electric powerplant, ready to be put in action at the first sign of danger. The cost ofoperation will be insignificant, as the plant is chiefly intended for use intimes of peace ... nothing in common with the so-called “death ray.”... It isimpossible to develop such a ray. I worked on that idea for many years before myignorance was dispelled and I became convinced that it could not be realized.Did even a design for such a weapon exist? The U.S. military did not investigatefurther, but the FBI was fearful and went to great pains to confiscate Tesla'spapers upon his death. After ten years of scrutiny, the papers were shipped toBelgrade under the auspices of Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanović, the U.S.ambassador to Yugoslavia. The material is now housed at the Nikola Tesla Museumin Belgrade.No “death ray” was ever found.MORE SPECULATIONSince Tesla worked in a shroud of secrecy, he has left a legacy of mystery. Evenif there was no death ray, other inventions are rumored to have resulted fromhis particle beam research. For example, Tesla professed to have created asecret apparatus that could produce energy in free air, thus eliminating theneed for a high vacuum. This would also enable him to produce an electricalforce of immense power, amplify that force, and ultimately produce a tremendouselectrical repelling force.On the occasion of his birthday throughout his remaining years, Tesla would makepredictions and offer insights that bordered on—or clearly entered—the realm ofthe absurd. * Human beings were really automatons under the control of outside forces. There was no individuality. * Long life could be achieved on a meager diet and little or no sleep. Tesla's diet consisted primarily of bread and warm milk, with rigorous daily exercise as part of his regime. * Someday it would be possible to photograph human thoughts. If a thought is reflected on the retina, then it would be possible to project the thought on a screen.In the meantime, the world still awaited his apparatus that would transmitmechanical energy to any part of the globe and his atom smasher that wouldproduce inexpensive radium.FINAL YEARSIn 1936, to commemorate his eightieth birthday, the Yugoslavian governmentfounded the Tesla Institute in Belgrade for the purpose of conducting appliedresearch in electrical engineering.The following year, Tesla would be honored by the Yugoslavian andCzechoslovakian governments with the Order of the White Eagle and the Order ofthe White Lion, respectively.The celebrated inventor would also receive an annual monetary honorarium fromthe Yugoslavian government during his final years. In March 1937, meanwhile, hewas elected to the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences.The year 1937 also marked a major turning point in Tesla's personal life. Hisfriend Robert Underwood Johnson passed away that October after a series ofillnesses. With both Katharine and Robert now gone, Tesla was all but alone withhis pigeons. That August, departing the Hotel New Yorker late one night to feedpigeons in the park, Tesla was hit by a taxi and thrown across the street.Refusing medical treatment, he limped back to the hotel and engaged a messengerto feed the pigeons until he could resume his routine. Tesla's health declinedin the succeeding months, as he grew gaunt from his limited diet and undiagnosedailments that may have resulted from the accident.Image [images/p137-001.jpg]Tesla's withdrawal from society and failing health would become even more markedduring the early 1940s. He grew increasingly paranoid about germs and becameever weaker and more emaciated. He took to bed sometime in 1942 and died quietlyin his sleep, alone and penniless, on January 7, 1943. The next day, a maidignored the “Do Not Disturb” sign on his door and discovered Tesla's body inRoom 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker.AFTERWORDSBefore he could receive a funeral, the FBI—under the pretense that Tesla hadbeen conducting espionage for Germany—ordered the seizure of all his belongingsfrom the several hotels in which he had lived. The entire estate would remain instorage for almost a decade, until the FBI deemed it safe to be shipped to theTesla Museum in Belgrade.On January 12, 1943, more than 2000 people attended a state funeral,underwritten by the Yugoslav Government, at the Episcopal Cathedral of St. Johnthe Divine in New York City. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia delivered a radio eulogy.Tesla's body was removed to a cemetery in nearby Ardsley, NY, where it would becremated. Years later, his ashes were shipped to the Tesla Museum.On June 21, 1943, in reversing an earlier patent ruling, the United StatesSupreme Court formally recognized Nikola Tesla as “the Father of Radio.”IT WOULD BE EASY TO END THE STORY HERE and say that Nikola Tesla was richlyrewarded and highly honored—as well as maligned—both during his lifetime andafter. Indeed he bore the mark of genius and left the world many gifts. He was adiscoverer and an inventor who towered over the likes of Thomas Edison andGuglielmo Marconi, who have been more lionized. Even Edison's most famousinvention, the incandescent light bulb, has been superseded by Tesla'sfluorescent bulb and, more recently, programmable LED bulbs.Tesla did not come to the United States and pursue his dreams of invention forthe purpose of getting rich. He was totally disinterested in money except as ameans of financing his research. His great early goal was to share his discoveryof AC with the world and enable electricity to do the work of humanity. Aninnovator and iconoclast whose eccentricities we are now able to identify asobsessive compulsive disorders, Tesla exited the world with a record ofachievement that is instrumental to all things electrical. He registeredhundreds of patents but left few blueprints. A circle of mystery shrouds hislife's work, but his legacy includes sustainable electric power, radar, radio,and wireless electrical power.Image [images/p139-001.jpg]Many of Tesla's predictions are the stuff of science fiction, contributing tohis image as a cult figure, maverick, and untapped genius. Then again, many ofhis discoveries and inventions were so far ahead of their time that they seemedlike science fiction at the time but later came to fruition. Tesla's patentscontinue to be mined as the basis of cutting-edge inventions. His boldinnovation and out-of-the-box thinking have inspired the likes of Bill Gates,Steve Jobs, and Elon Musk to name a few. Perhaps you, too, will find inspirationin his life and work.Tesla's undaunted spirit remains very much alive today as scientists, inventors,and entrepreneurs forge ahead in areas he pioneered: * The efforts of a Balkan firm to make playground equipment that generates electricity from children's play; * A California couple's explorations in magnetic-field architecture and hoverboard technology; * Work at Johns Hopkins University and MIT to develop a robotic arm controlled by a person's mind; * Research by a Boston group in transcranial direct-current stimulation (tcDCS) to alter mood; * Plans by two Russian physicists to build a prototype of Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower using modern materials and advanced electronics; * NASA's discovery of methane gas on Mars, suggesting the possibility of life; * Advanced development of flying cars in the United States, France, and elsewhere.STAY TUNED FOR THE NEXT INVENTION INSPIRED BY NIKOLA TESLA!"},{"pageContent":"FURTHER READINGCarlson, W.
