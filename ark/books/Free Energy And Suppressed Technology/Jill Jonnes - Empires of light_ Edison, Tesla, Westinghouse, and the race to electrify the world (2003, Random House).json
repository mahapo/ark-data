And in the final decades of thenineteenth century, three titans of America’s Gilded Age were among thePromethean few who dreamed of the possibilities hidden in this ethereal force ofnature—its awesome power visible only in the wild rumble and slash of electricalstorms. Each titan was determined to master the “mysterious fluid.” Each vied toconstruct an empire of light and energy on a new and monumental scale; eachenvisioned radiant enterprises that would straddle the globe, illuminating theinky night and easing forever the burden of brute labor. Thomas Alva Edison wasthe best known of these dreamers in 1879. The nation’s greatest inventor, Edisonwas creator of the incandescent light bulb and mastermind of the world’s firstincandescent light network. Then there was Nikola Tesla, the elegant, highlyeccentric electrical wizard who revolutionized the generation and delivery ofelectricity. Tesla was the Serbian immigrant dreamer who foresaw using thevibrating waves of the earth itself to generate unlimited power andcommunications. The final member of this trio was George Westinghouse, thecharismatic Pittsburgh inventor and tough corporate entrepreneur. He built upcompany after company, an industrial idealist who imagined a world powered bycheap and plentiful electricity. All his working life, he strove heart and soulto create that electrified world.This is also the story of the nascent years of the electric power industry andthe rise of a new technology that completely transformed society, a tale toldlargely through these three visionary figures, their triumphs, their blunders,their caustic feuds. As each struggled to make real his electrical dreams anddominate “the subtle and vivifying current,” the stage was set for one of themost unusual and vicious battles in American corporate history, the War of theElectric Currents. This war pitted Thomas Edison and his tried-and-truetechnology of DC (direct current) against Westinghouse and Tesla’s new andexperimental AC (alternating current). It is the archetypal corporate struggle,a modern industrial epic where American business titans battled to dominate andcontrol a world-changing technology, to create whole new Empires of Light. In atime of nineteenth-century Darwinian harshness, these new technologies drove therelentless growth of large and complex corporations, the economic basis for acentury of astonishing societal and material change. The rise of uncheckedcapitalism and large corporations, in turn, forced the nation to confront itsentire form of governance. Empires of Light is a story that resonates stronglyin our times."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_026_r1.jpg]Library of the J. Pierpont Morgan houseCHAPTER 1“Morgan’s House Was Lighted Up Last Night”In the late spring of 1882, Thomas Alva Edison, world famous as the folksygenius who had invented the improved telegraph and telephone, the amazingtalking phonograph, and the incandescent light bulb, would shamble inoccasionally to the hushed, formal suites of Drexel, Morgan & Company at 23 WallStreet, an imposing white marble Renaissance palace of mammon. There in aglass-walled back office, J. Pierpont Morgan presided at an oversize rolltopdesk. The autocratic senior partner wore a banker’s black suit, starched snowyshirt, wing collar, and fine gray silk ascot. His expensive, ever-present Havanacigar made the air smoky, redolent of privilege and power. Morgan’s investmentfirm was partially bankrolling Edison’s fevered building of America’s firstincandescent electric lighting system in the crowded commercial blocks of lowerManhattan. When Edison visited Drexel, Morgan, the clean-shaven, still boyishinventor loved to disparage the office’s gaslight globes as burning a “vilepoison.” But soon the gaslight would be gone, preempted by Edison’s belovedclean electric light.Edison, thirty-five, was already a celebrated figure in the downtown streets,recognizable in his signature slouch-brim hat or battered stovepipe, shabbyshirt, bright neckerchief, and frayed black Prince Albert coat. He and his crewswere logging dusty eighteen-hour shifts as they pushed to finish thefar-behind-schedule Pearl Street Station generating plant and install (only atnight) fourteen miles of just-below-the-street electrical conduits. All morningand afternoon pedestrians ebbed and flowed through the financial neighborhood,dark-suited men sporting shiny top hats or black bowlers, clutching their canes.“Bank messengers, with bags filled with coin, greenbacks, bills of exchange,bonds and stocks, hurry along,” wrote one contemporary of hustling-bustling WallStreet, “keeping a firm grip upon their bags and eying each person they passwarily, office boys, telegraph boys with yellow envelopes containing messagesfrom all quarters of the globe, dart here and there through the throng.”1[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts1a] These acolytes of the high-toned,handsome financial district shared the jammed nearby streets with horse-drawntrolleys, heavy delivery wagons, dog-drawn rag carts, noisy oyster sellers, andsmall boys hawking any one of the city’s dozens of newspapers. Everywhere, withthe weather warming up, the city’s streets reeked of horse piss and dung leftdaily by the 150,000 horses pulling the city’s trams, trucks, Broadway stages,and fancy rigs. At night, when Edison most liked to work, he could be found withhis Irish crews laying trenches somewhere near Pearl Street, already dirty withgrease and tar, or tinkering with the six jumbo dynamos installed up on thereinforced second floor.That late spring and summer, Edison had occasion to confer with J. Pierpont onanother small but important job. In his office, Morgan cultivated a renownedferocity: the gruff, impatient bark, the famed glare that challenged visitors ofany rank to intrude. Other wealthy men in this most hirsute of eras flauntedcomplex and flamboyant beards and mustachios, but the forty-five-year-old Morgansported only a plain, trimmed mustache. J. Pierpont Morgan had been raised anold money gentleman, conservative and stern in manner and habits. But theAmerica of the 1880s was changing rapidly, daring men and women to dream bolddreams, to grasp for great ventures and great wealth. Just a few blocks south,the Roeblings’ magnificent East River Bridge was nearing completion afterthirteen arduous years, a soaring engineering marvel of suspension, floatingacross the shimmering New York waters. Nearby, the elevated railroads with theirsmall belching steam engines chugged stolidly along, high above the chaos andstench of Manhattan’s tangled traffic, astounding visitors with their efficientmoving of tens of thousands of workers as they snaked north between tenementsand offices and then out to the far bucolic reaches of the city. The miracle ofthe great Atlantic cable flashed telegrams across the coldest depths of theocean. Where once letters from Pierpont’s father in the London office took weeksto arrive, now telegrams pulsed through in mere minutes. The railroads hadbecome mighty, creating new cities where there had been only marshland orprairie. In just the past year, they had laid an astounding ten thousand milesof track. The 1880 census showed fifty million Americans. Morgan, unlike many ofhis old money peers, relished this new temper of the times, admired men likeEdison who were bold, ambitious, hardworking, confident.Late that spring, Morgan, who had just returned from a long European tour, hadbriefly put aside his considerable business concerns and announced to Edison anaudacious decision. He was going to personally showcase the advantages ofEdison’s pioneering incandescent light in his elegant Madison Avenue brownstone,just then in the throes of top-to-bottom renovation. Morgan’s Italianate mansionwould become, thereby, the first private residence in New York to be illuminatedsolely by electricity. This was, of course, no simple matter. Nonetheless, theimperious Morgan wanted the electricity installed and working by the time he,his wife, Fanny, and their three teenage children moved in that fall from theircountry estate, Cragston, up the Hudson River. Edison was delighted to oblige,for it would be a great coup to have Morgan’s personal imprimatur on what manydismissed as a dangerous and exotic novelty. Whatever people thought of J. P.Morgan, no one thought him a fool. Money men had learned that he was decisive,intelligent, and swift of action, and above all, he kept his word, no smallmatter when spectral figures liked Jay Gould preyed upon the stock market.And so, as the shad were about to make their annual run up the Hudson River, acrew of Edison workers clopped up in a horse-drawn wagon to Morgan’s nearlyrenovated mansion at 219 Madison on the northeast corner of 36th Street. Theylaboriously excavated a large earthen cellar beneath the wooden stable, theirshovels rhythmically slinging dirt and rocks into a growing pile. Within themusty space of the dirt cellar, they installed a squat steam engine and boilerto power two electric generators, all of which displaced Morgan’s carriagehorses to a nearby stable. The men also dug a ditch connecting the new cellar tothe house, lined it with bricks, laid in the electrical wires, and bricked itover. Inside the mansion, decorator Christian Herter supervised the snaking ofinsulated electrical wires up through the elaborately wood-paneled and plasteredwalls where ordinarily the gas lines would have gone. These wires were thenthreaded through to every space in the mansion, and new electrical fixtures wereinstalled. In some rooms electrical wires hung straight down every few feet fromsmall holes in the tall ceilings, sprouting at their tips several small lightbulbs.On Thursday, June 8, 1882, Edison Electric Company president Major SherbourneEaton wrote Edison, “Morgan’s house was lighted up last night. I was not therebut I am told that the light was satisfactory and that Morgan was delighted. Thearmature of the 250 light [bulb] machine sparked badly. It will have to bechanged at once. Vail took charge of that. Herter was present and declaredhimself entirely satisfied. Morgan is pleased with everything but Herter’sfixtures.”2 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts2a] By fall, as the NewYork social season opened, the Wall Street financier and his family wereinstalled in their new home with its 385 electric lights, casting a soft, even,incandescent glow everywhere, from the servants’ halls and butler’s pantry tothe bedrooms and the “Japanese manner” reception room and sitting room. TheRomanesque dining room with its high oak paneling was particularly striking, forthere electric lights cast a lovely jeweled radiance through thetwelve-foot-square stained-glass skylight.The deluxe Artistic Houses rhapsodized about every rich and costly detail ofMorgan’s newly renovated brownstone residence, gushing especially about the vastand splendiferous terra-cotta drawing room, where “a breath from theGraeco-Roman epoch of Italia seems to have left its faint impress on the walls,or rather its faint fragrance in the atmosphere … amid the aroma of perfecttaste.” This must have pleased Morgan, who disdained the obvious vulgarity ofmany of the new Gilded Age millionaires. His house was meant to convey an auraof money and power, subtly burnished by his European education, culture, andworldly intelligence. What was genuinely new and unique was Edison’s electriclight. “Each room is supplied with it, and, in order to illuminate a room, youhave simply to turn a knob as you enter. By turning a knob near the head of hisbed, Mr. Morgan is able to light instantaneously the hall and every room on thefirst floor, basement, and cellar—a valuable precaution in case of the arrivalof burglars.”3 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts3a] This assumedburglars did not prowl and enter in the middle of the night. Because, asMorgan’s son-in-law Herbert Satterlee explained in a memoir of Morgan, “Thegenerator had to be run by an expert engineer who came on duty at three P.M. andgot up steam, so that at any time after four o’clock on a winter’s afternoon thelights could be turned on. This man went off duty at 11 P.M. It was natural thatthe family should often forget to watch the clock, and while visitors were stillin the house, or possibly a game of cards was going on, the lights would diedown and go out.”4 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts4a] Then there wasa careful groping about in the sudden murk to light beeswax candles and kerosenelamps.Yet that was the least of Morgan’s problems as a proud pioneer consumer ofelectrical power. Each silvery winter afternoon, the noise of the city day ebbedaway in the genteel and moneyed streets on Murray Hill. Then the delicious stillof the indigo evening mingled only with the occasional soothing clip-clop ofpassing horses and broughams. As the handsome houses lit up their gaslights, allwas quiet. But now, when the sun dipped below the horizon, Mr. Morgan’s steamengine and electrical generators roared to life, shattering the descendingblessed calm. These powerful machines clanked and throbbed so intensely, Mrs.James Brown next door complained that her whole house was vibrating. And thatwas not all. The infernal steam engine contraption, operating as it did on coal,also belched noxious fumes and smoke. Mrs. Brown reported that this waspermeating her pantry, leaving her silver tarnished. Mr. Morgan reassured hisaggrieved neighbor’s husband that an “expert” from Edison’s company “will calland see from personal observation and consultation what the features are whichcause you annoyance…. I need scarcely add that I shall spare neither exertionnor expense” to tame the overwrought machines.5[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts5a]Just after Christmas, when three weeks had passed and nary an Edison man hadmaterialized to right the situation, Morgan wrote indignantly to SherbourneEaton: “I must frankly say that I consider the whole thing an outrage to me, aswell as the neighbors—& am unwilling to stand it any longer. Please let thematter have immediate attention.”6[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts6a] Finally an Edison crew appearedand solved the problem by underpinning the machines with India rubber pads,lining the stable with felt, and further cushioning the whole installation withsandbags. Then yet another ditch was dug across the yard, this to funnel thecoal smoke from the steam engine into the mansion’s chimney. Now, a new kind ofnoise impinged. Reported son-in-law Satterlee, “In the winter when the snowmelted above the brick conduit, all the stray cats in the neighborhood gatheredon this warm strip in great numbers, and their yowling gave grounds for morecomplaints.”7 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts7a] And there was, ofcourse, the intermittent annoyance of wires short-circuiting and the generatoroccasionally malfunctioning.All this was understandably trying to the Morgan family. Yet Morgan wassurprisingly patient. As an investment banker who had backed many railroads,which were continually absorbing new technologies, he seemed quite acceptingthat problems large and small were inevitable. Had it not taken three arduoustries before the Atlantic cable was properly laid and began to work reliably?Finally, however, in the fall of 1883, J. Pierpont requested Edward H. Johnson,one of Edison’s top executives, to please come have a look at the mansion’sless-than-satisfactory year-old electrical arrangements. Johnson was not happyabout going to Morgan’s, but in a fledgling industry desperate for capital andcredibility, he had little choice. Morgan’s firm was a significant power in WallStreet. In a brief reminiscence written for Satterlee’s book, Johnson said that“after thoroughly canvassing the lighting of the house,” he found the systemalready outmoded. Electric light technology was advancing that quickly. “Mr.Morgan inquired of me what I thought of it. I asked if he wished an honest andcandid reply. He said he did. I said, ‘If it was my own I would throw the wholeD—— thing into the street.’ [Replied Morgan,] ‘That is precisely what Mrs.Morgan says.’” The next day, when Morgan was at his office reviewing balancesheets and surveying all that happened through his cigar haze, he summonedJohnson and asked him to go up to the mansion personally and redo the electric.A reluctant Johnson agreed.As part of the new, upgraded electrical lighting of the Morgan residence,Johnson decided to improvise “an arrangement for giving light on Mr. Morgan’slibrary table by means of concealed wires in the floor and contact spuds fixedin the legs of the table to penetrate the heavy and costly rug which covered thefloor.” The next morning quite early, Johnson received another summons to theMorgan manse. As he headed swiftly toward Madison Avenue and 36th, he had aqueasy feeling something had gone awry. Upon entering Morgan’s magnificentmosaic vestibule and removing his derby, he took one whiff of the air and hisworst fears were confirmed. “The house was pervaded by a strong smell of wet,burned wood and burned carpet.” The servant who had answered the door escortedJohnson to the library. “The library floor was torn up in several places; and inthe centre of the room was the partly burned desk and burned rug and othercharred objects piled in a heap…. One of the spuds [beneath the library table]had become bent or broken and an imperfect contact was made and a fire ensuedcompletely wrecking the beautiful room. The family were at the opera at thetime.” Johnson surveyed the soggy, blackened detritus, his spirits sinkingrapidly. For while J. P. Morgan did not yet fully dominate American finance ashe eventually would, he was still a famously impatient and ill-tempered man andgrowing ever more influential among the all-important New York money men. Yearslater, that moment was still vivid to Johnson. “It was a dismal scene…. SuddenlyI heard footsteps and Mr. Morgan appeared in the doorway with a newspaper in hishand and looked at me over the tops of his glasses.“‘Well?’ he said.“I had formulated an explanation, and was prepared to make an elaborate excuse.Just as I opened my mouth to speak, Mrs. Morgan appeared behind Mr. Morgan, andas I caught her eye she put her finger on her lips and then vanished down thehall. I said nothing but looked at the heap of debris.“After a minute’s silence Mr. Morgan said, ‘Well, what are you going to do aboutit?’“I answered, ‘Mr. Morgan, the trouble is not inherent in the thing itself. It ismy own fault, and I will put it in good working order so it will be perfectlysafe.’“He said, ‘How long will it take to fix it?’“I answered, ‘I will do it right away.’“‘Alright,’ he replied, ‘see that you do.’”8[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts8a]Morgan’s son-in-law wrote that the banker was subsequently so delighted with hiselectricity that he “gave a reception, and about four hundred guests came to thehouse and marveled at the convenience and simplicity of the system.” Two of theguests, California gold rush millionaire Darius Ogden Mills and his son-in-law,New-York Daily Tribune publisher Whitelaw Reid, promptly contacted the EdisonElectric Illuminating Company to have their own houses electrified. Mr. Mills,his shrewd face wreathed with his signature white muttonchop sideburns, alsoappeared the next morning at Drexel, Morgan and ordered his broker there to buyhim a thousand shares of Edison Electric stock. Morgan, who always kept a keeneye on the office’s comings and goings, intercepted Mills as he was leaving. Heinquired why Mills, who was a much admired investor, was there. When he heard,Morgan, whose firm was Edison’s lead banker, began then and there to match everyorder Mills made for Edison stock with an equal order of his own personal stock.Wrote Satterlee of Pierpont’s pivotal role, “His faith in the new industry, hisadvice, and his constant financial support were the factors that led to itsspectacular development; otherwise it might have taken many more years for it toreach its tremendous proportions.”9[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts9a]So pleased was Morgan with his electric alternative to what Edison gleefullydamned as “the vile poison” gaslight that he had Johnson install electric lightsin the rectory of his church, St. George’s, as well as in the church gym, tomake it easier to use in the winter. He also had a family friend’s school foryoung children wired. Explained Satterlee, “Pierpont sent Johnson around withhis mechanics and electricians, in the same way that he would send a basket ofhis best peaches or grapes from ‘Cragston’ to those who did not have orchards orgrapevines of their own. Nothing in life pleased him more than giving luxuriesto friends who could not have them.” Morgan had his own mansion rewired severaltimes. “He never seemed to care how much the walls and floors of the house weretorn up,” wrote Satterlee, “so long as the latest and most up-to-date deviceswere put in before other people had them.” Morgan once joked, “I hope the EdisonCompany appreciate the value of my house as an experimental station.”10[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts10a]Satterlee’s affectionate portrait fondly conveys Morgan the enthusiast, who puthis money and considerable influence behind the new electric light. But therewas a far darker side to Morgan. As a conservative financier, he was deeplyuncomfortable with the roller-coaster chaos and competition of aborningindustrial capitalism. As the years passed, Morgan concluded that he muchpreferred the predictability of monopolies he controlled. And, in truth,Morgan’s conservative soul flinched again and again in the early years at thehuge and risky amounts of capital the radical new technology of electricitywould turn out to require. In truth, it was not Morgan but Thomas Edison whotook the biggest risks when it came to building the first central station inManhattan. All this made Morgan even more determined that the early naturalmonopoly of Edison Electric Light and its handful of manufacturing companiesshould be sustained. As Morgan’s power grew, so did his passion for control, andit would govern much of his ruthless strategy in the coming bitter struggle overelectricity.For the very reason that electric lighting in the early 1880s was still such anexpensive and exotic novelty, it immediately became a status symbol for the veryrich and the adventurous. And there was no one richer in 1881 than William H.Vanderbilt, president and majority owner of the powerful New York CentralRailroad. Vanderbilt would eventually be, along with certain Drexel and WesternUnion partners, one of Edison’s significant (but later) backers in electriclighting. A big, stolid man with luxuriant curling muttonchops framing a blandface, Vanderbilt had earned the sobriquet “Colossus of Roads.” Having inherited$100 million from his notorious skinflint father, Commodore CorneliusVanderbilt, the mild-mannered William had handily doubled this sum by his ownsagacious flair for railroads and stocks. Vanderbilt had been out to Edison’sMenlo Park laboratory in 1880 and admired the soft glow of the light bulbs inthe cold New Jersey evenings. More impressive yet was Edison’s splendid newoffice at 65 Fifth Avenue, electrically ablaze with numerous ceilingelectroliers and lamps. One day in the spring of 1882, Vanderbilt himself cameto “65” and was quite taken with its amazing effulgence of incandescence. Alwaysthe eminently practical businessman, Vanderbilt desired to experience himselfthis new technology that he was being asked to invest in. With his deluxemansion nearing completion, Vanderbilt had offered his house (before Morgan did)as the first in New York to be illuminated with electricity. The emblems ofstatus may shift, but human nature generally delights in being first.Even before its completion, William H. Vanderbilt’s new “box house” was one ofthe most talked-about structures in the United States, a mansion as monumentalas the owner’s fortune. And the fortune was, in turn, a testament to the new andmighty railroad corporations, private industrial entities whose size,complexity, power, and potential for profit dwarfed all that had come before.Vanderbilt, quite used to being boss of thousands of rail workers, thoughtnothing of engaging a seeming army of six hundred workmen and sixty foreignartists and craftsmen, who swarmed about Fifth Avenue and 51st Street, buildingand ornamenting with antlike alacrity a palatial triple mansion, a luxuriousedifice of excess (such as Morgan found quite vulgar). For two years, NewYorkers had watched agog as the mansion was completed in record time. (Word wasit had cost $6 or $7 million, at a time when four-fifths of the nation earned$500 or less a year.) Entered through towering Italian sculptured bronze doors,Vanderbilt’s dream house featured everything from Venetian-style rooms withjewel-encrusted wallpaper to a subdued bamboo-lined Japanese parlor. William,with his great belly and luxuriant muttonchops, would live with his beloved wifein fifty-eight-room opulence in one-half, while two daughters and their familieseach occupied the two adjoining mansions. So the self-assured Edison and hispeople had eagerly bustled in in the spring of 1882, pleased as punch to beshowcased amid such grandeur. They installed a stand-alone generator and wiredthe huge mansion, as well as its two-story skylighted art gallery hung withlarge, expensive French pastoral scenes.Why, then, a reporter from Saint Louis asked the ever loquacious Thomas A.Edison not long after, as the inventor confidently regaled him with the imminentdownfall of the gas industry, was the Vanderbilt mansion now lit with gaslight?“He never tried our light,” asserted Edison. “The first night when the engineran it made a noise, as all new engines will, and Mrs. Vanderbilt complained ofit, and that settled it.”11 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts11a] Infact, Edison later elaborated, “Mrs. Vanderbilt became hysterical…. We told herwe had a plant in the cellar, and when she learned we had a boiler there shesaid she would not occupy the house. She would not live over a boiler. We had totake the whole installation out.”12[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts12a] But was it not true, pressed thejournalist, that the electric wires had also started a fire? “There is nothingto it except just this: In running temporary wires in different directions justto show Mr. Vanderbilt the effects, one of them came into contact with a burglaralarm wire, and this one, being overheated, charred some of the gold-threadwires of the cloth wallpaper which it ran into—that is all.”13[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts13a] While Edison belittled suchhigh-profile incidents and even implied, it seemed, that the nation’s richestcitizen might be a bit henpecked and lily-livered, his rivals in the gaslighting industry made sure the press knew the sorry details of this failure ofthe newfangled electric light.This “Vanderbilt incident” was why chroniclers of the electric light werecareful to describe Mr. Morgan’s house as the first in New York to besuccessfully wired for electricity. Both these stories—the burnt Morgan library,the small Vanderbilt fire—were seen as telling commentary on what made Morgan—asopposed to Vanderbilt—such an important figure in the early years of theelectric light. Morgan was lauded as courageous and persevering in the face ofserious setbacks, a true pioneer who put the full force of his financial andpersonal influence behind the new technology (though nowhere near enough, if youasked Edison). In contrast, Vanderbilt had retreated from personal endorsementat the first sign of trouble, but later, when success seemed more certain, hecame in as a major but passive investor.Both stories take us back to that shimmering moment when electricity—now anutter commonplace—was introduced into the gaslit household. Wealthy, cultivatedwomen in floor-length, rustling dresses delighted in showing their friends howif you just turned a knob on the wall, the room’s clear incandescent bulbs beganalmost magically to glow, casting an even, clear light. Unlike candles, theelectric light did not burn down or become smoky. Unlike gaslight, there was noslight odor, no eating up of a room’s oxygen, no wick to trim or smoked-up glassglobes to be cleaned. Many months went by before the light bulbs burned out. Butthe introduction of electricity in the home was also fraught with the peril ofelectric shock or fire, which gave a certain delicious frisson to the wholeexotic, expensive enterprise. In the early 1880s, electricity was still awondrous and “mysterious fluid” resonant with glamour, status, and danger.But for the visionary capitalist, electricity possessed other, more practicalallures. Already this astonishing invisible “agency” had birthed two radicallynew technologies—the telegraph and the telephone—that had forever compressed andaltered the age-old realities of time and distance. The perspicacious werealready reaping fortunes. The most farsighted were tantalized by even greaterelectrical prizes. Who would further harness electricity to light the nation’sstreets, its dim factories, and all those millions of households, dramaticallytransforming man’s age-old sense of day and night? He who could bestow morehours to the day—for work, for play—would be wonderfully rewarded. Of evengreater moment in these commercial times, who would harness electricity tooperate work-saving machines, mechanisms artfully reinvented to liberatehumankind from the hard toil of farm and factory? He who could unleash the full,only-dreamed-of potential of electricity and control this awesome invisiblepower would become wealthy and powerful indeed. Was it any wonder the War of theElectric Currents would be so fiercely waged?"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_019_r1.jpg]Michael FaradayCHAPTER 2“Endeavor to Make It Useful”The elusive, invisible mystery of electricity became the subject of specific,recorded inquiry in the dawning days of the Golden Age of ancient Greece. In 600B.C. Thales, erudite philosopher and astronomer in the thriving Ionian port ofMiletus, observed the special qualities of the rare yellow orange amber,jewel-like in its hardness and transparency. If rubbed briskly with a cloth,Thales showed, amber seemed to come alive, causing light objects—like feathers,straw, or leaves—to fly toward it, cling, and then gently detach and float away.Amber was similar to a magnet in its qualities, yet it was not a lodestone. As ayouth, Thales of Miletus had studied in the sacred Egyptian cities of Memphisand Thebes. Perhaps it was there, under the burning sun, that this earliest ofGreek philosophers first learned from the priests about the prized amber, withits seeming possession of a soul.In the myth of Phaeton, handsome mortal son of Apollo the sun god, the Greeksexplained amber’s magic. Phaeton aspired to drive his father’s lustrous goldenchariot on his own through the shimmering sky, and his father, to prove hislove, rashly agreed. Soon after Phaeton took the reins, Apollo’s formidablesteeds sensed his youthful alarm and veered rebelliously off course, racingfirst far into the darkest heavens and then too near the earth, scorching theland, setting whole cities and nations afire, turning fruitful Libya intodesiccated desert, roiling the oceans, and splitting open continents. Jupiter,enraged by such hubris and wanton destruction, hurled a fatal thunderbolt atPhaeton, who fell lifeless from the sky, his burning hair blazing like ashooting star across the darkened sky. His sisters, the Heliades, gathered abouttheir dead brother, mourning so bitterly that finally Jupiter, taking pity,turned these lissome girls into ever sighing poplars and their tears intotranslucent amber that tumbled into a passing stream. This bittersweet mythexplained amber as a mysterious godly gift. We now know that gleaming amber isbut prosaic fossilized tree resin. But amber’s rare qualities—the creation ofstatic electricity—were sufficient to pique human curiosity and yield up thetiniest clue about the mysterious power of electricity.Almost two millennia would pass before Thales’s original observations aboutamber were enlarged upon. In 1600, the much esteemed London physician andphilosopher William Gilbert was appointed chief doctor to the strong-willed andaged Virgin Queen, Elizabeth I. Gilbert not only replicated Thales’s amberexperiments, he went far beyond them. An admired officer of the conservativeRoyal College of Physicians, Gilbert was also actively engaged in scientificinvestigations. However, he held off publishing his challenging treatise, DeMagnete, until the pinnacle of his career, when he was president of the RoyalCollege and firmly ensconced as the popular elderly queen’s personal doctor. Thefull title (translated into English from the original Latin) was On the Magnet,Magnetick Bodies Also, and on the Great Magnet the Earth; a New PhilosophyDemonstrated by Many Arguments and Experiments. Gilbert praised his own “newstyle of philosophizing,” his bold and “unheard-of doctrines,” and warned thathis great life’s work was not for “smatterers, learned idiots, grammatists,sophists, wranglers and perverse little folk.” The earth’s interior, positedGilbert, was “a pure, continuous magnetic core, which orients our globe in theheavens just as it swings a compass needle to the north.”1[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts1a] This explained many actions ofmagnets, including their noticeable “lines of force.”These were not idle intellectual inquiries Gilbert was pursuing, but questionsof tremendous commercial moment. England was a dominant sea power in avidpursuit of the wealth of nations, and Queen Elizabeth was seeking to improve thearts of navigation. Therefore, anything that shed light on the nature ofmagnetism and compass reading was important. A famous painting shows WilliamGilbert, arrayed in white ruff and dark velvet robes, at his handsome Londonresidence, Wingfield, demonstrating electrics and magnetics for his sovereignmonarch and her court. The seated Queen Elizabeth, who favored exquisitejewel-encrusted, fur-trimmed gowns, watches intently, as do two of Her RoyalMajesty’s most famous explorers and navigators, Sir Walter Raleigh and SirFrancis Drake. Gilbert is standing before them, showing the strange attractionsof amber, magnets, and various substances. The very word electric was coined byGilbert, who played on the Greek word for amber, elektron, to come up with aterm to describe amber’s attracting qualities for certain materials.Like a good philosopher and experimenter committed to truly observing andexplaining factually what happened in nature, Gilbert did not rest with amber,but tested all kinds of materials, finding that glass, rock crystal, sulfur,sealing wax, and some minerals, when rubbed, also became “electric.” This wasGilbert’s great electrical discovery and contribution: that numerous hardmaterials—not just amber—could be electrified when rubbed. (What Gilbert couldnot know, of course, was that his rubbing created charged electrons—positive ornegative—that attracted like or repelled opposite. When these charges flow alonga conductive material, they become an electric current.) He used a pivoted(nonmagnetic) light gilt needle, his “versorium,” or electroscope, to studywhich materials had electrostatic attraction. (The needle swung toward or away,depending on whether the charge was positive or negative.) Moreover, his furtherinquiries into these “electrics” delineated how the weather, water, olive oil,and so on affected their “electricity.” The good doctor deduced that whatactivated the numerous motions of attracting and repulsing was an invisiblewatery substance he termed “electrical effluvia.” In 1603 Gilbert’s greatpatroness, Queen Elizabeth, died, and the author of De Magnete soon followed.His legacy was the discovery that electricity could be generated and hisadmonition that philosophers must “seek knowledge not from books only but fromthings themselves.”For more than half a century, human knowledge and understanding of electricityprogressed little further. Philosophers throughout Europe remained fascinated byelectricity, and De Magnete was studied carefully and its experiments copied.But the next major electrical advance came almost unwittingly (as often happensin science), from the Lutheran mayor of Magdeburg, a small free-trading city inthe Holy Roman Empire (today Germany) burned to the ground by marauding Swedesin 1631. The mayor, Otto von Guericke, was a well-educated scion of a leadingfamily, and he devoted his middle decades to rebuilding and reviving his crushedcity and retrieving through treaties its free status. The overburdened vonGuericke found soothing solace, “a gate of tranquility,” in astronomy. Hedecided to try to replicate the earth’s sphere and study a complex system of“virtues” he believed swirled in and about it. He created a solid sulfur ballthe size of an infant’s head, which he placed in a sturdy wooden frame androtated by an attached handle. When this twirling yellow globe (later ones werefar larger and incorporated more minerals) was rubbed, it became electrostaticand attracted and then repelled many light objects, typically a feather.The convivial burgomaster enjoyed amusing his guests by walking about with asmall sphere steadily propelling before him a buoyant feather, ultimatelysteering the feather to cling to some visitor’s nose. When the sphere really gotwhirling and was rubbed, it began to glow and throw off sparks. With his globe,von Guericke inadvertently showed that one could produce notable amounts ofelectricity, yet he did not advance actual knowledge. In Germany in the lateseventeenth century, von Guericke happily made and dispensed his globe toothers, but no British (or other) philosopher seems to have interested himselfin its potential for electrical experiments. That did not transpire until 1709,when Englishman Francis Hawksbee, curator of instruments at the Royal Society,created a similar object, also an electrostatic machine. His was a mountedhollow glass sphere that could be cranked to high speeds and rubbed to createelectricity and eventually an eerie light inside, a feat shown to great acclaim.Hawksbee thought to add a “rubber,” a short adjustable column with a stuffedleather piece that pressed steadily on the glass (in place of a hand) to providefriction. Electrostatic machines like this could generate sizable sparks andbecame the standard source of electricity for experiments and entertainmentduring the early eighteenth century.The next true electrical advance came from Stephen Gray, a modest native ofCanterbury on the Stour River, then as now home of the great Anglican cathedral.Gray was from a family of dyers, but he acquired enough education to read Latinand become a friend to the astronomer royal in Greenwich. While Gray earned hisdaily bread as a dyer, his inner being was dedicated to science and experiment.He sufficiently impressed the professors at Cambridge with his stargazingreports that at age forty-one they hired him to work at Trinity College’s newobservatory. At the university Gray discovered the mysterious delights ofelectricity, but also “mercenary” flaws in his employers. He retreated toCanterbury for a few years and then sought residency at the Charterhouse inLondon, a day school for poor boys and a selective residence for impecuniousgentlemen. Knowing well England’s continuing obsession with practical advancesin sea-going, Gray assured the trustees that if admitted, he intended to devotehimself to “inquiries Relating to Astronomy and navigation and might haply findout something that might be of use.”2[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts2a] Whatever else Gray did in hisfirst decade as a genteel Charterhouse pensioner, by 1729 he began to work onseeing how far he could send the “electrical vertue.” Using an electrified glasstube, he tested all kinds of substances, finding metal wire to be excellent forconveying electricity, as was plain packthread. Having succeeded in sendingelectricity fifty-two feet, in June of 1729 Gray repaired to the grander spacesof a wealthy friend’s country estate. There they soon transmitted electricity765 feet and methodically worked their way through all manner of substances,hollow or solid, determining which conducted electricity well or not at all.Gray also noticed that if you suspended an iron rod pointed at both ends fromsilk threads and touched it with an electrified glass tube, it briefly gave offcones of light, a wondrous and memorable result. Gray further remarked thatgreat sparks of electricity made noises not unlike that produced by thunder.The most memorable, original, and flashy of Gray’s experiments, and one that wasdelightedly replicated for years, was that of the dangling Electrified Boy. OnApril 8, 1730, Gray constructed a stout wooden frame from which he suspended viastrong silk strings—as if he were a very large bird—a forty-seven-pound boy,probably one of the Charterhouse charity students. All parts of the boy werethickly covered in nonconducting clothes, leaving only his head and hands and afew toes naked. In one outstretched hand, the boy held a wand with a danglingivory ball. When Gray touched the boy on the backs of his naked toes with anelectrified glass tube or vial, the electricity traveled to the boy’s head(where his hair stood on end) and his outstretched hands. Then threefeathery-light piles of brass leaves under the boy rose up in three impressivelittle clouds, before sinking back down. One pile rose only to the ivory ball,showing that the electricity had continued on beyond the hand, one pile rose ashigh as the face, and the third rose to the bare hand, which hung lower than thehead. A thrilling variation had the dangling boy stretch out his finger andtouch another person. This gesture transmitted a noticeable spark and a shock,if the standing person was on a conducting material. Gray found he could alsoelicit sparks from the end of the boy’s nose. The presence and nature of the“electrical vertue” was thus dramatically made visible. Pensioner Gray hadinvaluably demonstrated to the world much about the conductive qualities ofelectricity. Human nature being what it is, frolicsome philosophers could notresist many amusing versions of the Electrified Boy demonstration. Men were soonbestowing electrified kisses on (literally shocked) women. One waggish Frenchhost wired the chairs at his dinner table so that his astonished guests suddenlyfound sparks flashing from their forks!For the next major electrical leap forward, we move across the English Channelto the Continent. All over England and Europe in this self-proclaimed Age ofEnlightenment, the sages of the day were studiously observing the natural worldaround them, offering up theory upon theory to explain things previously takenfor granted, ignored, or explained by myths or magic. Electricity was one of themost mesmerizing and entertaining of nature’s multitude of puzzling phenomena.Up until this time, philosophers had learned from the royal physician WilliamGilbert that there was electricity, what he called “electrical effluvia.” Fromvon Guericke and Hawksbee, people had learned to make and operate electrostaticmachines that more efficiently produced electricity. From pensioner Stephen Graycame a serious study of which materials were conductors and then how farelectricity could be conducted. In this era, even the most dedicated and seriousscientists felt it was their role to provide awe-inspiring electricaldemonstrations that also entertained.At this stage, the pursuit of electrical knowledge was restricted by the limitedamounts of electricity experimenters could actually generate. The first solutionto storing electricity was stumbled upon in Leyden, Holland. Professor Pietervan Musschenbroek’s lawyer friend, Andreas Cuneus, had come by the laboratory todivert himself with various electrical experiments. One involved filling a jarwith water and electrifying it by touching a wire sitting in the water with anelectrified glass vial. Cuneus then touched the protruding wire and received abad jolt from the stored electricity. He mentioned this to Musschenbroek, who inmid-January 1746 electrified the jar of water (via the wire) with one of hisgreat whirling globes, not a small electrified glass vial. He wrote several dayslater to an academic in Paris to explain “a new but terrible experiment, which Iadvise you never to try yourself, nor would I, who have experienced it andsurvived by the Grace of God, do it again for all the kingdom of France.”Musschenbroek warned that when he touched the metal protruding from the jar, hewas “struck with such force that my whole body quivered like someone hit bylightning … the arm and entire body are affected so terribly I can’t describeit. I thought I was done for.”3 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts3a]The sensational news of the Leyden jar spread like electrical wildfire, causingevery other serious electrical philosopher to construct one and experience itsfearsome jolts. Soon it was found that lining the jar halfway up with metal foilinside and out helped retain the electricity, while the power of several jarscombined created a shock strong enough to kill a sparrow. For the first time,scientists could actually store these wondrous electrical forces.The standard Leyden jar consisted of a squat container of thin glass encasedinside and out on its lower two-thirds with a metal foil coating. A brass wiretopped by a small brass ball protruded from the snug (nonconducting) cork lidand then also hung down into the water-filled jar. Electricity generated byelectrostatic machines was directed into the glass jar via the ball and wire,traveling down the metal wire or, later, down a long metal chain, and thencharged the metal foil and water. When a philosopher needed electricity, hetouched the ball and out it flowed in a great jolt. Leyden jars could retaintheir electrical charge for as long as several days, depending on insulation andstorage conditions.image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_001_r1.jpg]While the philosophers in the royal societies and universities observed,measured, and cogitated on their electrical findings in respectable learnedjournals, they also continued to use electricity (such as it was understood) forpseudomagical entertainments and diversions. With the invention of the Leydenjar, many a traveling huckster took to charging good money to the bold and bravefor a chance to experience the man-made lightning that sparked forth from thejar. At the Versailles court of Louis XV, the relentless search for novelty andamusement led the Abbé Nollet, a serious student of the electrical arts, tobegin arranging spectacular electrical displays. Most memorable was theassembling of 180 gendarmes in a big circle in the Grande Gallerie, each holdingthe next man’s hand. Nollet, attired in powdered, coiffed peruke and a long,pinch-waisted coat with fashionable big cuffs, wished to see how far theelectrical shock would travel. The electrostatic machine was revved up, chargingthe Leyden jar. The gendarme at the head was holding the Leyden jar. When hetouched the brass ball, 179 others leaped into the air with a strange precision.“It is singular to see the multitude of different gestures,” wrote the goodabbé, “and to hear the instantaneous exclamation of those surprised by theshock.”4 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts4a] The king and his jadedcourtiers found the leaping gendarmes both marvelous and hilarious. It was alsoa palpable demonstration that electricity traveled (though they could not knowit) at the speed of light. Having diverted the court, Nollet satisfied hisscientific soul that this was not a fluke by repeating the test first on twohundred robed Carthusian monks at their monastery in Paris and then a greatcircle of six hundred people at the Collège de Navarre.The mysteries and marvels of electricity absorbed many of the brightestintellects of early-eighteenth-century Europe, but the next electrical advancesemanated from a very unlikely venue, the British colonies in North America. Inthe attractive Quaker port city of Philadelphia, laid out in a spacious grid,Benjamin Franklin, the respected editor of the popular Poor Richard’s Almanack,had attained sufficient prosperity to devote himself largely to philosophicalmatters. Little involved in his printing business and not yet caught up inpolitics, in 1744 Franklin saw in Boston a Scottish lecturer demonstrate thepopular dangling Electrified Boy. The next fall, a Quaker merchant friend inLondon, Peter Collinson, sent along various electrical apparatus and writings.Franklin was soon hooked. Months after European philosophers had becomeenthralled with the new possibilities of the Leyden jar and were hotly debatinghow and why it could store electrical charges, Franklin and his experimentingcolleagues had one in hand. The genial Franklin, forty, his brown hair shoulderlength, attired in plain breeches and long jacket, held electrical court at hissmall Market Street house that also served as his printing shop, library, andnow laboratory.By the spring of 1747, Franklin was writing Collinson, “I never before wasengaged in any study that so totally engrossed my attention and my time as thishas done lately. What with making experiments when I can be alone, and repeatingthem to my friends and acquaintances, who, from the novelty of the thing, comecontinually in crowds to see them, I have, during some months past, had leisurefor little else.” Curious neighbors and strangers jammed in to watch Franklingenerate electricity with his fast-turning glass cylinder, capture those flaringsparks in his Leyden jar, and then demonstrate the many puzzling wayselectricity seemed to work. At one point Franklin wrote his friend in London,“If there is no other use discovered of electricity, this however isconsiderable, that it may make a vain man humble.”5[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts5a] It was a most confoundingeffluvium.In fact, Franklin made considerable strides as he applied his tremendouscuriosity and intellect to understanding electricity, conducting hundreds ofexperiments aimed at teasing out specific electrical qualities. He also devisednumerous “recreations,” including the “counterfeit spider,” a black arachnidthat came “alive” as it danced about in an electrical field; a book thatappeared aflame; and a most amusing electrical fish, a thin gold leaf in atapered shape. “If you take it by the tail, and hold it at a foot or greaterhorizontal distance from the prime conductor, it will, when let go, fly to itwith a brisk but wavering motion, like that of an eel through water.”6[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts6a] Perhaps most telling of futureevents was a “magical” picture showing the British king wearing his crown. Thosewho tried to remove the crown received a notable shock. Such enterprises wereboth playful and instructive, and Franklin was the first to assert that therewere not different kinds of electricity—as many believed—but one basic fluidwith positive and negative qualities. Yet Franklin, being ever the practicalsoul, was “chagrined that we have been hitherto able to produce nothing in thisway of use to mankind.”7 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts7a]Franklin fluctuated between a humble awe at the small revelations of nature’ssecrets and a giddy glee at his newfound skills. He and his merry band ofelectrical experimenters had sufficiently mastered the production and storage ofelectricity to plan a most unusual and festive dinner down by the SchuylkillRiver prior to dispersing for the muggy summer months. In April 1749, Franklinjovially described their plan: “A turkey is to be killed for our dinner by theelectrical shock, and roasted by the electrical jack, before a fire kindled bythe electrified bottle; when the health of all the famous electricians inEngland, Holland, France, and Germany are to be drank [sic] in electrifiedbumpers, under the discharge of guns from the electrical battery.”8[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts8a]Like other philosophers before him, Benjamin Franklin suspected that lightningwas simply a massive jolt of electricity. And by early 1750, he believed he hadcome up with a practical and lifesaving object that could also test out hislightning-is-electricity theory. Franklin suggested erecting tall, pointed metalpoles on tall buildings to conduct the lightning down to the ground, where itwould dissipate into the dirt, thus protecting the structures from fire. For theactual experiment, the lightning off these poles could be collected into Leydenjars. He explained, “The effect of [points is] truly wonderful; and, from what Ihave observed on experiments, I am of opinion that houses, ships, and eventowers and churches may be effectually secured from the strikes of lightning bytheir means.”9 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts9a] However, peoplewere understandably reluctant to tempt lightning, a known creator ofconflagrations, onto their property. This same year around Christmas, Franklinhimself, failing to exercise caution, was knocked senseless just by man-madeelectricity intended to kill a turkey. Franklin described taking “a universalblow throughout my whole body from head to foot, which seemed within as well aswithout…. I had a numbness in my arms and the back of my neck which continuedtil the next morning but wore off.”10[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts10a]In the next two years, Benjamin Franklin found his talents and time given overmore and more to pressing public affairs. Yet he was still thinking deeply aboutthe mysteries of electricity and in September of 1752 finally had occasion tocarry out a long-planned experiment. On an oppressive and muggy afternoon, as athunderstorm began building, its angry dark clouds boiling up ominously on thehorizon, Franklin and his grown son hurried through the heat out into the fieldsstill flecked with goldenrod and wildflowers. Franklin carried a simple kite hehad constructed using silk handkerchiefs and cross-sticks. At the very top ofthe kite, he had affixed a foot-long piece of metal wire to serve as aconductor. At the bottom, he had attached a hempen string and from that a ribbonof silk (a known nonconductor). Where the hemp and silk met, Franklin had hung ametal key. As the storm winds gusted violently through, Franklin maneuvered hiskite into the air, whereupon he and his son sought shelter from the downpour ina small wooden structure. The kite raced high up into the gray clouds, while thenearby trees rocked in the storm gusts. In the distance, lightning vibratedbrilliantly across the darkening sky. Franklin and his son watched the hemp, butthere was no sign of electrical life. Wet and losing hope, they suddenly sawwhat they were looking for—the loose threads of the hempen string rising as ifelectrified. Franklin, knocked out by electricity one time, gingerly touched hisknuckle to the metal key and saw and felt a distinct electric spark. Once thestring was wet, the electricity from the passing lightning storm flowed steadilydown it. Franklin was just lucky no lightning struck his kite directly. And soit was that Franklin, by this brilliant experiment, entered the pantheon ofelectrical giants, philosophers who signally broadened and advanced the humanunderstanding of this powerful, puzzling, invisible energy. No more didelectricians have to speculate. They now knew, thanks to Benjamin Franklin, thatlightning was electricity similar to—or maybe the same as—that which men weremaking with their electrostatic machines. Franklin was hailed as aneighteenth-century Prometheus, one who had literally stolen fire from theheavens and lived to tell the tale.What Franklin did not know as his kite bucked through the electrified heavensthat warm late-summer afternoon was that his book Experiments and Observationson Electricity had been translated into French and portions read aloud earlierthat spring at a Parisian scientific meeting. The many fractious Frenchscientists, hearing these fascinating ideas for experiments with lightning rodsand kites, promptly set off to try them. Three installed a forty-foot-talllightning rod in a beauteous Gallic garden out in the countryside ofMarly-le-roi. The pole, enshrined in a simple wooden structure, stood atop athree-legged stool set in three wine bottles. On May 10, 1752, a thunderclap washeard and an assistant rushed up with a Leyden jar just as a lightning stormbegan. He successfully drew off large sparks from the pole. As the heavensopened and hail pummeled down, a curious crowd ignored their ever wetter clothesto watch as the lightning was drawn off again and again into the jar. And so,much to Benjamin Franklin’s amazement, not long after he had flown his kite, hediscovered that French electricians had beaten him to it! They had performed hisproposed experiments from his book first.But their dramatic success and wild enthusiasm propelled Franklin to glitteringfame and celebrity throughout the United States and Europe. The king of France,no less, applauded this astonished (but delighted) colonial tradesman for hisscientific brilliance. Harvard and Yale bestowed honorary degrees, theprestigious Royal Society in London conferred the Sir Godfrey Copley gold medaland inducted the Philadelphian and fellow British subject into its exaltedranks. As one Italian scientist said, “Who would have ever imagined thatElectricity would have learned cultivators in North America?”11[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts11a] Word spread of these Prometheanwonders, and Georg Richman, a Swedish scientist living in St. Petersburg inRussia, sought to replicate them. He held aloft a wire-tipped pole during alightning storm and had the misfortune to attract a full hit of lightning. Hewas electrocuted on the spot, becoming in 1753 the first person to die during anelectrical experiment, a martyr to the young science.Predictably, just as those seriously investigating electricity used it also todivert and amuse, so was it quickly hailed as a medical boon. As one Italianscientist said in 1746, “No thought could occur more readily than this, themoment people saw such light flashing from the body, limbs, and skin, and feltthe stings, painful blows and sharp stimuli that penetrated almost into thebones when the lights appeared.”12[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts12a] Real doctors (such as they werein those days) and itinerant quacks promoted electricity as the cure forconstipation, nervous disorders, sexual maladies and infertility, sciatica,rheumatism, lacrimation, and herpes, to name a few ailments. In Italy, threemedical schools opened devoted just to healing through electricity. Italy (thenpart of the Austrian empire) would also be the scene of one of the greatestmodern advances in electricity, the consequence of a bitter scientific disputebetween the quiet, retiring Luigi Galvani, esteemed physician and anatomist atthe University of Bologna, and Alessandro Volta, respected professor of physicsat the ancient University of Pavia. Like almost every other scientist of theirage, each man was deeply fascinated by electricity, Galvani wondering about itspossible role in the workings of the body’s nerves and muscles, Volta looking atthe basic nature of electricity and its chemical interactions.This famous scientific feud had its origins in a series of experiments performedby Luigi Galvani, forty-four years old, handsome, clean-shaven, and coiffed inthe era’s gentlemanly fashion—white peruke, fine lace jabot at his neck, andlong dark coat and breeches. On January 26, 1781, Galvani was dissecting a pairof large frog’s legs with some assistants. Nearby, an electrostatic machine wasbeing turned. Galvani’s assistant noticed with astonishment that when he touchedthe frog’s leg at a particular spot with a scalpel, the leg—unattached to anyfrog—jerked. Galvani wrote later, “I immediately repeated the experiment. Itouched the other end of the crural nerve with the point of my scalpel, while myassistant drew sparks from the electrical machine. At each moment when sparksoccurred the muscle was seized with convulsions.”13[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts13a] Sensitized to this phenomenon ofjerking frog’s legs, Galvani now noticed that prepared frogs suspended by brasshooks and hung on an iron trellis in his backyard also jerked when the brasshook was pushed against the trellis. Galvani became convinced that what he wasseeing was “animal electricity” completing a circuit with these metallicinstruments. “The idea grew that in the animal itself there was an indwellingelectricity.”14 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts14a] For the nextdecade, Galvani quietly worked on a variety of experiments with his frog’s legsand published a series of papers in Latin (the scientific language of the day),culminating in 1791 with “On the Effect of Electricity on the Motion of theMuscles.” Just as when Benjamin Franklin’s work became known, hundreds ofdedicated electrical philosophers rushed to replicate Galvani’s “animalelectricity” experiments.Among them was physicist Alessandro Volta of Pavia, forty-six, a stern-visaged,clean-shaven man with a thin fringe of dark hair. Professor Volta’s electricalaccomplishments were already so stellar that he had been inducted into London’sprestigious Royal Society. Son of an impecunious nobleman, Volta had grown up onLake Como and shown a precocious ability in science and mathematics. His majordiscovery up to this time was the highly sensitive “condensing electroscope”that measured electric charge. While Volta initially accepted Galvani’s strikingdiscovery, applauding “the fine and grand discovery of an animal electricity,properly so called,” as he began to replicate the experiments on the frog’s legshe became more and more skeptical.15[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts15a] Ultimately, he became convincedthat the electricity was coming not from the frogs, but from the metal, and in1794 he challenged Galvani to refute his, Volta’s, findings that the electricitywas actually “metallic.” Galvani’s many supporters, led by his nephew Aldini,came back with a frog experiment that showed a distinct jerk even when no metalwas involved. The always reserved Galvani himself was still mourning the loss in1790 of his beloved wife, a learned woman who had worked on these experimentswith him. The feud grew sufficiently bitter that Volta would write to onefriend, “I know those gentlemen want me dead, but I’ll be damned if I’ll obligethem.”16 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts16a] So the animal versusmetallic electricity dispute dragged on, with each scientist and his followersthroughout the Continent performing many subsequent experiments that often didlittle to illuminate the situation but seemed important or decisive at the time.Then in 1796 Napoleon Bonaparte swept over the Alps with the French army, andthese Austrian citizens found themselves subjects of a new revolutionaryCisalpine Republic. Luigi Galvani loyally refused over the next two years totake an oath of allegiance to the new government, and in late April 1798 he wasexpelled from the University of Bologna, where he had happily practiced anatomyfor thirty-five years. In early December, Luigi Galvani, sixty-one, died,politically ostracized and penniless. Professor Volta, after initial protests,reached some accommodation with the Napoleonic regime and continued on at theUniversity of Pavia.As leader of the “metallic” electricity forces, Alessandro Volta had beenmethodically testing dissimilar metals and measuring their electric charge withhis sensitive electroscope, determining if each was positive or negative. Healso observed that the electrical charge was noticeably stronger when his fingertouched the metals, which he deduced was the effect of saline moisture. On March20, 1800, Volta wrote a letter in French to Sir Joseph Banks, president ofLondon’s Royal Society, saying, “After a long silence, for which I shall offerno apology, I have the pleasure of communicating to you … some striking resultsI have obtained in pursuing my experiments on electricity excited by the meremutual contact of different kinds of metal, and even by that of otherconductors, also different from each other, either liquid or containing someliquid, to which they are properly indebted for their conducting power…. Thisapparatus to which I allude, and which will, no doubt, astonish you, is only theassemblage of a number of good conductors.”17[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts17a]Drawing on his carefully observed knowledge about which materials did and didnot conduct electricity, Volta assembled atop one another inch-wide pairs ofcopper disks and zinc disks separated from other such disks by a cloth disk orpasteboard soaked with salt water. When these disks were all touching oneanother, the copper lost electrons to the saline-soaked cloth, while the zincgained electrons from the same wet cloth. As the zinc dissolved, hydrogen gaswas produced at the surface of the copper. The resulting electrical chargesflowed out in a steady direct current along the wires. This electrochemicalreaction produced the first steady generation of man-made current, flowing fromthe battery on two insulated wires, one on top and one on the bottom.image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_002_r1.jpg]Here was the first primitive battery able to deliver a continual, steadyelectrical charge, in contrast with the electrostatic machines or the Leydenjar, which delivered their electricity in high-voltage static bursts or jolts.His pile, said Volta, operated “without ceasing, and its charge re-establishesitself after each explosion. It operates, in a word, by an indestructiblecharge, by a perpetual action or impulse in the electric fluid.” Actually, theVolta battery pile would stop generating electricity once the saline liquiddried up or the metal was all dissolved. For while Volta believed it was solelythe contact of dissimilar metals that powered his battery, it was in fact theelectrochemical interactions between these metals and the liquids. The longerthe battery ran, the more these materials diminished. Volta also designed analternate version of his battery, which he called his “crown of cups,” thatfeatured brine-filled cups connected by alternate strips of zinc and silver andmetal wire.With France and England at war, Volta’s communication took some time to reachLondon and was not read before the Royal Society until June 26, 1800. Volta’sbrilliant and pathbreaking work was hailed throughout Europe and America. Acontemporary declared the battery “the most wonderful apparatus that has evercome from the hand of man, not excluding even the telescope or the steamengine.” Other scientists quickly replicated Volta’s “electrical pile,” buildinglarger and larger versions. Ironically, the steady current of electricitygenerated by Volta’s battery—steady direct current—came to be known as Galvanic,thus verbally immortalizing his electrical foe. Volta, in turn, waslinguistically enshrined by the term volt, which measures the electrical forceof a current. In the immediate aftermath of his epochal electrical triumph,Volta was much honored and richly rewarded, becoming a count in the Napoleonicgovernment. Newly married, famous, and wealthy, he then played little role infurther advancing his battery or electrical philosophy.Other scientists scrambled to construct ever bigger, more powerful Voltaicbatteries to generate more powerful, longer-lasting Galvanic currents. Over inLondon at the new Royal Institution on Albemarle Street, already “the world’sgreatest showplace for the popularization of science,” the dashing young chemistHumphry Davy arranged to have constructed progressively larger batteries in theinstitution’s basement laboratory. In the first decade of the nineteenthcentury, Davy applied these big batteries to his pathbreaking work establishingthat electrochemical reactions were the basis of electricity. The RoyalInstitution was opened in 1799 to advance and apply science “to the commonpurposes of life,” and its initial patrons were the distinguished Englishgrandee Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, and the controversialinventor-statesman Count Rumsford, an American-born “opportunist, womaniser,philanthropist, egotistical bore, soldier of fortune, military and technicaladviser.”18 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts18a] It was CountRumsford who hired Davy, a handsome and charismatic young chemist who wasbeginning his swift rise to scientific and intellectual glory. Davy’s publiclectures at the Royal Institution combined such erudite pyrotechnics anddazzling showmanship, hundreds of well-dressed personages soon flocked into theamphitheater to watch and listen as this effervescent Cornishman with histumbling locks brought to life the abstruse mysteries of electricity orchemistry. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, friend and admirer, attended thesecrowded scientific affairs and claimed in awe that if Davy had not been “thefirst chemist of the age, he would have been the first poet.”From the start, Davy believed that the electricity produced by AlessandroVolta’s battery came from electrochemical interactions. Moreover, once Davy hadconstructed a sufficiently powerful battery in October 1807, he demonstratedthat the converse was true—chemical compounds could be decomposed into theirbasic elements by electricity. Davy decomposed alkalies into potash and soda ashwith electricity, then further extracted entirely new elements, potassium andsodium. Davy, this son of a humble wood-carver, had by now burnished his innatenobility by marrying a wealthy heiress. Fortune was soon followed by publichonors, including a knighthood. He became Sir Humphry Davy. Sir Humphry’spassion, panache, and accomplishment allowed him to travel in the highest socialcircles, whether among dukes and lords at their great country estates or amongthe era’s most brilliant artists and thinkers, immortals like the poet WilliamWordsworth and the incomparable painter of landscapes and light Joseph Turner.In 1808, Davy, by now director of the Royal Institution, had constructed agigantic battery of two thousand pairs of plates in the basement laboratory.Applying the intense electrical energy produced by this massive battery toalkaline earth, Davy extracted more new elements—magnesium, calcium, barium, andstrontium.But most visually spectacular of Sir Humphry’s electrical researches was the arclight. In 1809, he gave one of his most literally dazzling lectures. He stoodbefore his usual large enthralled audience and held up two thin charcoal sticks,which served as conductors of electricity. One stick was then connected to apowerful Voltaic pile. When the electricity began to flow through the firststick, Sir Humphry touched it to the top of the second stick. A brilliant sparkappeared where the two met. What amazed those present was that as Sir Humphrypulled the two sticks slightly apart, the spark grew larger and the electricitytraveled in a dazzling arc of light between the two slender carbon rods. Thisalmost painfully bright blue white light would burn until either the carbons orthe electricity ran out. Sir Humphry’s thrilling demonstration set offdetermined efforts to produce a commercial arc light, but properly calibratingthe carbons created many troubles and no battery could economically run brightlights for the many hours needed to be practical.And there the art of electricity would linger, as frustrated scientists andphilosophers tried year after year to unlock and decipher electricity’smultitude of remaining secrets, especially what many suspected was itsrelationship to magnetism. The early days of dedicated individual philosophersworking on electricity in their homes—men like Benjamin Franklin, Otto vonGuericke, and Stephen Gray—were slowly giving way now to the modern era ofuniversity-trained scientists operating out of university laboratories orspecial institutes. Mastering the growing mass of specialized knowledge wastime-consuming, while few individuals could afford to construct the ever morecomplex equipment needed to study electricity, especially the gigantic Voltaicpiles. Moreover, national leaders were well convinced of the vital importance ofscience and technology to national wealth and well-being. So it was notsurprising that the next great electrical breakthrough came out of a Europeanuniversity.In the spring of 1820, Hans Christian Oersted, forty-three, physics professor atthe University of Copenhagen, was giving a private lecture on electricity to agroup of advanced students. The professor, a tall, sturdy man with dark curlsand thick sideburns, was dressed in a long black coat, vest, and high-collaredwhite shirt and cravat. Before him on his wooden laboratory table, ProfessorOersted had set up a small Voltaic battery. In his hand, he held a chargedelectrical wire, intending to make a point about heating platinum wire usingelectrical current. But as he prepared to apply the wire, the professor noticedthe wildly swinging magnetic needle on his large desk compass. When he moved thewire above and around the compass, the needle responded strongly—as if to amagnet—and in very specific ways to the electric current.Oersted, like Sir Humphry Davy, was a self-made scientist, a country boy oflittle means whose love for learning and intellectual prowess had earned himscholarships and finally a university appointment. Fluent in several languages,Oersted was trained in pharmacy (thereby having access to many chemicals), hadtraveled widely to meet other scientists, and was also among the many strivingto establish the relationship between magnetism and electricity. In an 1813book, he had written, “An attempt should be made to see if electricity in itslatent stage, has any action on a magnet as such.”19[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts19a] Now here, seven years later, byhis astute observation of the swinging compass needle, Professor Oersted hadstumbled across the long-sought clue. In subsequent experiments, Oersted foundthat the compass needle swung about and took up a position at right angles tothe charged wire. If he reversed the flow of electricity, the needle deflectedin the opposite direction. In short, electric current produced its own magneticfield and, by means of that field, a force.On July 21, 1820, Han Christian Oersted announced his discovery ofelectromagnetism in a four-page paper written in Latin, whose (translated) titlewas “Experiments on the Effect of an Electric Current on the Magnetic Needle.”He sent copies of his monograph to every important university, learned society,and electrical scholar in Europe. Oersted wanted full credit for making thishistoric discovery, which unraveled further the mysteries of this invisible butpotent force, electricity. As word of his great breakthrough slowly spread inthis era before telegraph, telephone, or train—Sir Humphry learned of it only inOctober—Han Christian Oersted was hailed and feted as an electrical genius, ashad been Benjamin Franklin and Alessandro Volta before him. Oersted was awardedthe Royal Society’s Copley gold medal and inducted into many scientificsocieties.When Parisian professor of mathematics André Marie Ampère read of Oersted’sexperiments, he was highly skeptical. Ampère, a deeply religious man whosepersonal life was bedeviled by disastrous marriages and delinquent children,sought solace in mathematics, chemistry, and science. Ampère readily replicatedOersted’s work, then proved that the strength of the magnetic field intensifiedwith the rise of the power of the electric current. Ampère also showed thatcurrents flowing parallel in the same direction attract each other and currentsflowing in opposite directions repel. Over the next decade, this newunderstanding—that a current-carrying wire created a magnetic field aroundit—led to the creation of ever more powerful electromagnets. In Albany, NewYork, American engineer and inventor Joseph Henry was one of the pioneers. Heused his wife’s old silk dresses to insulate wires, enabling him to wrap morethan one coil around a piece of iron. The more layers of coils, the morepowerful the electromagnet. This work would earn him a professorship atPrinceton University. Henry, who later became the first head of the newSmithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., devised gigantic electromagnets bywrapping hundreds of feet of insulated electrical wire around hugehorseshoe-shaped pieces of iron. Demonstrations with these odd-lookinginstruments elicited thrilled gasps from audiences, for these electromagnetscould lift loads as heavy as a ton. Yet despite all these advances in theunderstanding of electricity, it had few useful applications.Oersted’s discovery of electromagnetism and Ampère’s expansion of that workgenerated a deluge of fresh electrical research and an ensuing avalanche of newscientific articles. At the Royal Institution near Piccadilly Circus, theassistant Sir Humphry Davy had hired back in 1813, Michael Faraday, had becomeEngland’s foremost analytical chemist, a man renowned for his brilliance,originality, hard work, gentle nature, and sheer scientific productivity. (Manywould later say that Sir Humphry’s greatest scientific contribution was hiringthe unknown Faraday.) Though Michael Faraday had evinced little interest inelectricity, in the spring of 1821 the editor of the Annals of Philosophysuggested that Faraday apply his much admired intelligence to authoring a surveyarticle on the new science of electromagnetism, thus luring the thirty-year-oldphilosopher into this fascinating and puzzling field.Faraday looked more like a poet of the Romantic school than a scientist, for hehad a wonderfully handsome, gentle face with a high brow, dark, intelligenteyes, and a headful of thick, wavy curls parted in the middle. Faraday had not,like Oersted, come to science through a university. Indeed, his formal educationended at age twelve when he was apprenticed for seven years to a bookbinder.Faraday had completed his service and was just starting that career when afriendly customer bestowed upon him coveted tickets to Sir Humphry’s highlypopular lecture series entitled “The Elements of Chemical Philosophy.” Faradaywas so smitten by what he heard and saw at the Royal Institution that heamplified the exquisite notes he had taken during the quartet of talks, madenumerous illustrations, compiled an index, and bound it all together into alovely little book. This he sent along to his new idol, Sir Humphry Davy. LaterFaraday would write, “My desire to escape from trade, which I thought viciousand selfish, and to enter into the services of Science … induced me at last totake the bold and simple step of writing to Sir H. Davy.”20[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts20a] Sir Humphry, having risen tomagnificent heights from his own humble beginnings, had been sufficientlyimpressed by the ambition, intelligence, and ardor of this twenty-two-year-oldblacksmith’s son (and his jewel of a book) to hire Michael Faraday as hisassistant. The job paid £100 a year, along with two upstairs rooms at theinstitution and a supply of coal and candles. So while Faraday was not auniversity man, he was ensconced in a prestigious and well-funded institute.Such was Faraday’s natural scientific brilliance that his discovery of benzeneand related chemicals pioneered the way for the new and important aniline dyeindustry, even as he also advanced the liquefaction of gases. By 1824, he was aFellow of the Royal Society. The next year, at age thirty-three, Michael Faradaywas appointed director of the Royal Institution’s laboratory.Once he delved into the great mass of books and articles on electricity, tryingto sort out what was important for his survey article, Faraday was thoroughlyensnared by the conundrum of this invisible force. By 1822, Faraday had writtenin his laboratory notebook, “Convert magnetism into electricity.”21[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts21a] He tried on four occasionsduring the 1820s, even as he was making stunning breakthroughs in chemistry, tofigure out some means for converting magnetism to electricity, but he wasstymied. Then, on August 29, 1831, Faraday, dressed as ever in his plain blackcutaway coat, high-waisted pants, high collar, and plain cravat, noticed a weirdeffect that provided the vital electrical clue.Faraday had an iron ring. On one side he had wound a coil of insulated wire thatwas attached to a battery. On the other side of the ring he wound a second coilof insulated wire, and that was attached to a galvanometer, which measures smallelectric currents. When Faraday activated the battery to electrify the firstcoil, he looked hopefully for signs of life in the second coil but saw none.What did catch his eye was that the galvanometer registered a feeble andmomentary current when the battery was attached or detached. Here was the firstclue: A change in the charged coil’s magnetic field—starting and stopping it byactivating the battery—briefly created current in the second wire coil.Faraday’s friend and colleague John Tyndall would later ponder Faraday’s geniusand explain it thus: “He united vast strength with perfect flexibility. Hismomentum was that of a river, which combines weight and directness with theability to yield to the flexures of its bed. The intentness of his vision in anydirection did not apparently diminish his power of perception in otherdirections; and when he attacked a subject, expecting results, he had thefaculty of keeping his mind alert, so that results different from those which heexpected should not escape him through preoccupation.”22[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts22a] Faraday had registered thosetiny movements on the galvanometer.image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_003_r1.jpg]Over the next couple of months, as autumn brought the usual rain and gloom toLondon, Faraday found a day here and there to pursue these intriguing blips bythe galvanometer. In his first experiment, he wound a coil of wire around astraight iron core. He took two long bar magnets and held them in a V and usedthe wrapped iron core as the third side of the triangle. When the V of themagnets was separated, breaking the magnetic circuit, current was induced in thecoil. Noted Faraday in his laboratory journal, “Hence, distinct conversion ofMagnetism into Electricity.” To further test this, he took a pencil-shapedmagnet and simply moved it in and out of coiled wire. The moving magnetic fieldcreated a brief current in the wire. But Faraday was interested in producing acontinuous current, not just brief bursts.So he set up a simple twelve-inch copper disk on an axle that revolved betweenthe opposite poles of a permanent magnet. On one side of the copper disk, a wireran from the axle to a galvanometer. Then another wire led from the galvanometerto a metallic conductor held against the rim of the copper disk. When the copperdisk revolved, disturbing and thus changing the magnetic field of the magnet,the galvanometer registered a continuous electric current. Wrote Faraday in hisminutely detailed laboratory notebooks, “Here therefore was demonstrated theproduction of a permanent current of electricity by ordinary magnets.” Simplystated, Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction says that an “electriccurrent is set up in a closed circuit by a changing magnetic field.”23[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts23a]image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_004_r1.jpg] image[images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_005_r1.jpg]Faraday modestly described his epochal discovery of the world’s first electricdynamo as “A New Electrical Machine” in a paper before the Royal Society inLondon on November 24, 1831. Oersted had shown how to create magnets withelectricity, while Faraday had revealed the other, even more mysterious andmomentous half of electromagnetism, how to generate electricity with magnets. Asmarvelous as was Michael Faraday’s further deciphering of electricity, no one atthe time envisioned its extraordinary ultimate consequences, for who couldimagine that this was the foundation of the modern electrical industry? UnlikeVolta, who largely rested on his laurels after inventing the battery, over thenext decade and a half Faraday’s “almost intuitive insight into many of nature’ssecrets” led him to elucidate on electromagnetic lines of force and therelationship among electric current flow, the magnetic field, and motion throughthat field. He showed that simply by changing the magnitude of current flow, youcaused change in the magnetic field, and that in turn caused current in anyconductor in the magnetic field. Faraday would also clarify the electrochemicalnature of electricity, determine the specific inductive capacities of manymaterials, establish a relationship between light and magnetism, and resolve thelong debated question of whether the electricity produced by lightning,electrostatics, batteries, and his generator were all the same invisible entity.They were.24 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts24a] As one biographerwrites, “His versatility, originality, intellectual energy and sheer staminaleave us in awe.”25 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts25a]Faraday’s own life, work, and stature became an inspiration and model forsuccessive generations of scientists. Believing that Sir Humphry’s wealth andtitled eminence distracted from his wholehearted pursuit of science, MichaelFaraday politely turned down time-consuming titles, opportunities to earn afortune, and all the socializing attendant on honors and wealth. A devout memberof the small Sandemanian Christian sect, he lived modestly, quietly, and happilywith his beloved wife upstairs at the Royal Institution. But down in thebasement laboratory Michael Faraday was a veritable lion, a passionate andbrilliant scientist of rare energy able to select and focus on the mostmeaningful, discerning problems. His scientific output was prodigious andfundamental, influencing peers in many fields. His laboratory notebooks set astandard of beautifully observed detail, organization, and honest recordkeeping. The charm of his prolific writings—and his readiness to admit his manylaboratory failures on the road to experimental success—earned him wide andenduring readership. His three-volume Experimental Researches in Electricity andMagnetism remains a classic.In the 1830s, with Sir Humphry Davy dead in 1829 at the young age of fifty-two,Faraday truly took over the running of the Royal Institution. One of his firstacts was to inaugurate the Friday evening discourses, as well as specialChristmas lectures for children. Faraday, whose whole life course was radicallyand joyfully altered by his attendance at Sir Humphry’s famously enthrallinglectures, viewed these public events as highly important. Who could say whichchild might embrace a life of science after a Christmas lecture or whichinfluential and enthusiastic member of the Friday night audience might decide toshower grateful guineas on the Royal Institution? In the age when laboratoryscience was truly coming to the fore, Michael Faraday was its greatest sage andprophet. He was fittingly also the institution’s most scintillating andmesmerizing speaker, his handsome face full of passion, hair flying poeticallyas he moved fluidly about to show his experiments before the packedamphitheater. The Friday evening lectures began promptly at 9:00 P.M. before anexpectant, educated audience dressed formally as for the opera. Recalled onefan, “His audience took fire with him, and every face was flushed.”26[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts26a] Faraday’s friend Tyndall wrote,“He exercised a magic on his hearers which often sent them away persuaded thatthey knew all about a subject of which they knew but little.”27[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts27a] When the lecture ended promptlyat 10:00 P.M., the animated audience drifted to the institution’s magnificenttwo-tiered library, there to imbibe refreshments, view an exhibition based onthe evening’s topic, and marvel at science. Faraday’s 1849 Christmas lecture forchildren, “The Chemical History of a Candle,” is still read.Under Michael Faraday’s ardent leadership, the Royal Institution became one ofEngland’s most important social and intellectual centers when that nation waspowerfully ascendant, attracting many eminent Victorians and luminaries,including Charles Dickens, Charles Darwin, and T. H. Huxley. Wrote one Faradaybiographer, “Such was the prodigality of his output and the diversity of hisskills that modern chemists, no less than physicists, engineers, and materialscientists, regard him as the founder of their subjects: some sciences andtechnologies owe their very existence to his work…. He bequeathed to posterity agreater body of pure scientific achievement than any other physical scientist,and the practical consequences of his discoveries have profoundly influenced thenature of civilised life.”28 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts28a]Faraday was uninterested in spending his own time making anything specificallypractical or useful. “A philosopher,” Faraday explained, “should be a manwilling to listen to every suggestion but determined to judge for himself. Heshould not be biased by appearances, have no favourite hypothesis, be of noschool and in doctrine have no master…. Truth should be his primary object. Ifthese qualities be added to industry, he may indeed hope to walk within the veilof the temple of nature.”29 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts29a] Andso, dedicated to the higher calling of Truth, Michael Faraday had littlepatience for utility. After he had demonstrated a new chemical process or openeda new electromagnetic realm and the inevitable question followed, “What is itsuse?” Faraday liked to quote Benjamin Franklin, who had famously replied: “‘Whatis the use of an infant?’ The answer of the experimentalist is, ‘Endeavor tomake it useful.’”In the ensuing years, scientists and inventors in England, Belgium, France,Germany, Italy, the United States, and every Western nation all mightilyendeavored to make electricity useful, exerting their mental faculties to theutmost in the wake of Faraday’s magisterial work. Electroplating was at thistime electricity’s one practical industrial and commercial application. However,batteries were steadily improving, so that by the 1840s electricity wrought itsfirst miraculous revolution, becoming the basis for a workable telegraph. Thesemiddle decades of the nineteenth century saw remarkable, rapid technologicaladvance, with steam engines, railroads, and the telegraph demolishing alltraditional notions of power, space, and time. In these same years, coal-gaslighting became a cheap and convenient illuminant indoors in urban homes,offices, and some factories, displacing whale oil and candles. Distributed froma central gashouse to buildings and sidewalks via underground pipes—much the waywater was—coal-gas lighting spread quickly in big cities. On cloudy or moonlessnights, gas lamps now supplanted whale oil lamps on major metropolitan streets.The coming of gaslight, like the coming of the railroads and the telegraph,noticeably altered the aeons-old rhythms of time and place. “A new age had begunfor sociality and corporate pleasure-seeking…. The work of Prometheus hadadvanced by another stride,” wrote Robert Louis Stevenson, singing the praisesof gaslight. “Mankind and its supper parties were no longer at the mercy of afew miles of sea-fog; sundown no longer emptied the promenade; and the day waslengthened out to every man’s fancy. The city folk had stars of their own;biddable, domesticated stars. It is true that these were not so steady, nor yetso clear, as their originals; nor indeed was their lustre so elegant as that ofthe best wax candles. But then the gas stars, being nearer at hand, were morepractically efficacious than Jupiter himself…. But the lamplighters took totheir heels every evening, and ran with a good heart. It was pretty to see manthus emulating the punctuality of the heavens’ orbs.”30[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts30a] Gas lighting proved as popularin American cities as it was in foggy London, and by 1875, there were more thanfour hundred gas lighting companies in the United States.As gas lamps replaced (or supplemented) the age-old light of oil and candles,and brought nocturnal lighting for the first time to many murky city streets,inventors and entrepreneurs struggled to come up with a workable version of thebrilliant arc light Sir Humphry Davy had demonstrated to such acclaim in 1809.The British operated a few isolated and remote arc light lighthouses using largebatteries, while a few daring and avant-garde members of the surviving Frencharistocracy tried them on their grounds. When engineers installed experimentalarc lights near a château in Lyons, the local paper reported, “One could in facthave believed that the sun had risen. This illusion was so strong that birds,woken out of their sleep, began singing in the artificial daylight.”31[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts31a] The arc light spectrum wasindeed close to that of sunlight, and many commented on its evenness andsteadiness, so unlike the flickering, swaying light produced by burning gasjets, oil lamps, or candles. But to become a commercial entity, the arc lightneeded a far simpler, better design and a practical electrical generator. Whilebatteries served well enough for the minimal power needs of the telegraph andthen the telephone, battery power was twenty times more expensive than thatsupplied by steam engines and certainly far too expensive a form of energy tocompete with popular gas lighting.Creating a better generator was a deeply baffling task. It would be almostthirty-five years from Faraday’s epochal demonstration of his “electric machine”to the triumphant emergence of a truly practical dynamo. Many labored on thedynamo problem, but the man who ultimately prevailed “to make it useful” wasBelgian engineer Zénobe-Théophile Gramme, who worked for a Parisian maker ofelectrical devices. By the early 1870s, Monsieur Gramme had not only designed afar more powerful direct current generator, but, equally important, had alsoinvented the electric motor, which he showed was just a dynamo or generatorrunning in reverse. Gramme incorporated a major advance introduced by Werner vonSiemens: The bit of genius that propelled his generator ahead of all others wasusing electromagnets rather than regular magnets. A Gramme dynamo featured aring of iron encircled by coils of wire that revolved in the plane of the linesof force between two electromagnets.With the Gramme dynamo in hand, the time was ripe for the arc light. And in1876, Russian military engineer Paul Jablochkoff (also living in Paris) finallycame up with a commercial version—the Jablochkoff “candle”—that cast a gentlerlight than the earlier, glaring arc lights. The “candle” paired two tall, thincarbon sticks separated by a layer of kaolin cement, which served as bothinsulator and binder. “No mechanism was required for operation; once started thecarbons continued to burn until consumed, lasting about two hours. Clusters ofcandles were arranged so that when one burned down, another was automaticallystarted up.”32 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts32a] Unlike earlierarc lights, Jablochkoff’s could run for as long as sixteen hours, because as onepair sputtered out, another would take over.However, Gramme’s original dynamo design, where a device called a “commutator”directed the current to mimic the direct current produced by batteries, causedone carbon stick to burn twice as fast as the other, a serious flaw. MonsieurGramme, who now had his own company, solved the problem by redesigning hisdynamo to generate an alternating electric current that burned the candle pairsat equal rates. Unlike direct current (DC), where the electrons are spacedevenly as they flow steadily along the conductor, alternating current (AC)causes the electrons to cluster and advance and retreat in fits and starts.Despite all the advances, early arc lights were still more difficult to servicethan gaslights, and their dazzling glare still restricted use to largespaces—major squares and avenues, department stores, railroad stations,circuses, building sites, wharves, and factories. They required the erecting ofspecial towering poles so the light would not impinge on the normal visualfield, hurting people’s eyes.One visitor to Paris hailed the arc light for its “magnificent illumination,”exclaiming, “The whole street, to the tops of the loftiest houses, is ablazewith a flood of beaming light which makes the streets seem like the scenes ofsome grand play at the opera.”33 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts33a]Robert Louis Stevenson, however, was appalled when he first saw the arc lightsof Paris, denouncing them as “horrible, unearthly, obnoxious to the human eye; alamp for a nightmare! Such a light as this should shine only on murders andpublic crime, or along the corridors of lunatic asylums, a horror to heightenhorror. To look at it only once is to fall in love with gas, which gives a warmdomestic radiance.”34 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts34a] The Frenchauthorities and many businesspeople felt differently, and by 1878 the half mileof the supremely elegant avenue de l’Opéra was ablaze with arc lights, as wereother major Parisian venues, including the Magasins de Louvres and the Théâtrede Châtelet.American scientists and businessmen were as interested in arc lights as theircounterparts on the Continent, and when they learned of the Jablochkoff“candles” in Paris, the race was on to introduce something comparable in theUnited States. The Yankee businessmen who came up with the first workable arclight system might become the Vanderbilt of lighting, reaping fame and fortunebrightening the American night. At the Centennial Exposition of 1876 inPhiladelphia, most famous for its 1,400-horsepower Corliss steam engines andThomas Edison’s multiplex telegraph, electrical inventor Moses G. Farmerexhibited three of his own versions of the glaring arc lights. They were poweredby the first dynamo designed by Americans, the work of the brilliant Farmer andWilliam Wallace, his partner and proprietor of the nation’s foremost brass andcopper foundry in Ansonia, Connecticut. Within the year, a major arc lightcompetitor emerged out in Cleveland: a young chemist named Charles F. Brush. Hebeat Wallace and Farmer to the market and by the fall of 1878 was installing hishissing, brilliant arc lights inside a Boston department store, ContinentalClothing House.Thomas Edison’s longtime friend Professor George Barker of the University ofPennsylvania was certain this was a terrific and fertile field for Edison, andhe tried to pique his interest by sending along numerous reports on this newestform of artificial illumination. When that had no effect, on Sunday, September8, Barker escorted Edison to Wallace’s large brass foundry. Under a coolgunmetal sky, Edison and Barker stepped off the train with a journalist in towfrom Charles Dana’s New York Sun. For the first time, Edison finally had achance to really see and examine Wallace and Farmer’s steam-run 8 horsepowerelectric dynamo, which they dubbed the “telemachon.” This was the machine thatlit up their whole line of eight arc lights at one time. Reported the Sun,“Edison was enraptured. He fairly gloated over it…. He ran from the instrumentsto the lights, and from the lights back to the instruments. He sprawled over atable with the SIMPLICITY OF A CHILD, and made all kinds of calculations. Heestimated the power of the instrument and of the lights, the probable loss intransmission, the amount of coal the instruments would save in a day, a week, amonth, a year, and the result of such saving on manufacturing.”35[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts35a] The actual machines and theirblazing light were having exactly the effect Professor Barker had hoped for.Edison was now afire with excitement. Ever the competitor, he turned to hishost, William Wallace, and said, “I believe I can beat you making the electriclight. I do not think you are working in the right direction.”36[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts36a] William Wallace, who had beenworking on arc lights for several years and had his system up and going, was agood sport. He accepted the bet and shook hands on it.Then Edison rushed back to quiet, bucolic Menlo Park, his research workshop inbackwater New Jersey, to throw himself into creating a better and more practicalelectric light. He worked feverishly, thrilled at the possibilities of this newfield. “It was all before me. I saw the thing had not gone so far but that I hada chance. I saw that what had been done had never been made practically useful.The intense light had not been subdivided so that it could be brought intoprivate houses.”37 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts37a] Edison alwaysliked to go after “big things.” In examining Wallace’s lights, he had graspedboth the immense possibilities of the dynamo and the limited nature of theblazing arc lights. The man who came up with the best arc light system mightwell make a fortune stealing away even that 10 percent of the gas lightingbusiness—that of the streetlights. But the man who could subdivide the light—totake it indoors and tame it into a gentle glow—and power it with a dynamo, hewould be the true Promethean, the blazing electrical pioneer, the hailedbenefactor of humankind (and wealthy to boot). The race to illuminate withelectricity the houses and offices of America—nay, of the entire world—and topower the machines of the new industrial order, was on."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_015_r1.jpg]Thomas Edison’s laboratory, Menlo Park, New JerseyCHAPTER 3Thomas Edison: “The Wizard of Menlo Park”On a mild September day in 1878, a reporter for the New York Sun headed to theCortlandt Street dock, making his way through the cursing teamsters, theirhorses straining under great loads, past the oyster stalls, and into thePennsylvania Railroad ferry terminal, there to board the railroad’s ferry forJersey City. Up on the boat’s top deck, one could feel the harbor breeze andstudy the panoply of commercial vessels plying the Hudson River—the brigs andschooners, a three-masted clipper billowing toward the open seas, the workhorsebarges coming down from the Erie Canal, and long side-wheel steamers. At times,it seemed the whole world, with all its woes and its wealth, was converging onManhattan. Half a million immigrants surged in every year now. True, most keptmoving, their eyes and hearts set on farms or striking it rich in the mines outwest, but fifty thousand stayed here, cramming into the old tenements andfilling the almshouses. The downtown slums had become sinkholes of cholera andtyphoid. At night, paupers huddled in doorways near the steam grates. When thecold grew killing, those piteous beings retreated to the city’s dank indoorsleeping dens. Yet the nation’s wealth poured in, too. Every day the wharveswere jammed with sailing vessels and steamships, more than ten thousand a yearcoming and going. The magnificent buildings of Wall Street and the financialdistrict reflected this great economic power, as did the sheer energy of therushing, intent crowds. It was generally believed that the hard times followingthe Panic of 1873 were finally over.On the New Jersey side of the river, hundreds who had debarked the Pennsylvaniatrains waited to board the giant ferry, all heading toward the cacophony ofdaytime New York. On the southbound accommodation train, it was just over twentymiles to Menlo Park, where Thomas A. Edison had moved from Newark two yearsearlier and established America’s first invention factory. There Edison plannedto develop “a minor invention every ten days and a big thing every six months orso.”1 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts1a] Menlo Park had no realrailway station, just a small wooden platform, and arriving visitors walked up asteep flight of crude steps to find themselves on the highest point between NewYork and Philadelphia, a pastoral place of fields edged by stands of woods, cowsgrazing in the distance, and a mellow sky that arched high overhead. Shortlyafter moving, Edison wrote a friend that his new lab was located at “Menlo Park,Western Div., Globe, Planet Earth, Middlesex County, four miles from Rahway, theprettiest spot in New Jersey, on the Penna. Railway, on a High Hill.”2[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts2a]Walking up the dirt road from the train tracks, one heard only birdsong, thesound of the wind, and mechanical rumblings from the handful of big plainbuildings surrounded by a white picket fence. The two-story clapboard of grayishwhite was already famous as Edison’s laboratory. Telegraph wires sprouted fromthe upper reaches, met up with tall wooden poles, and were carried off towardManhattan. The laboratory was the center of this small universe, and Edison wasits animating spirit, around whom all else revolved. Thomas Edison had announcedhe was becoming a full-time inventor in early 1869. The previous six years hadbeen spent drifting from city to city as a crack itinerant Western Unionoperator, while he was continually devising improvements in telegraphy andsoaking up technical books on telegraphy and electricity. Once committed tofull-time inventing, Edison had done well enough with such clever items as anelectric copying pen. But he really hit the jackpot in late 1874 when he soldrights to his quadruplex telegraph system to Western Union rival and Wall Streetmanipulator Jay Gould for $30,000.This was heady success for a small-town boy from Port Huron, Michigan, whosefather had muddled along in various grocery, real estate, and truck farmingenterprises, while his mother took in boarders. Young Alva, as he was known, hadreceived very little formal education, being taught mainly by his mother, whohad briefly been a schoolteacher. His Michigan boyhood revolved largely aroundhis many ingenious efforts to make mechanical things or brew new chemistryexperiments, including one that produced “an explosion [that] … wrecked a cornerof the building and burned [Edison] and some of the other boys.”3[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts3a] When Edison, age thirteen, joinedthe Grand Trunk Railroad as a newsboy, he impressed his bosses as hardworking,entrepreneurial, and intent on self-improvement. He spent $2 (two days’ pay) tojoin the new Detroit Public Library and proceeded to read his way through itsshelves.It was during these railroading years that Edison became partially deaf. Once ashe was struggling to get aboard a moving train with his newspapers, a conductorhelping him clamber on “took me by the ears and lifted me. I felt something snapinside my head, and my deafness started from that time.”4[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts4a] Ever the optimist, Edison viewedhis deafness as an advantage, a built-in buffer against outside distractionsthat helped him concentrate on whatever he was doing. By his teens, that wastelegraphy. Edison’s avid curiosity about all things mechanical had led him tobefriend the local telegraph operators wherever he was. When Edison turnedsixteen in 1863, his natural flair for banging out and receiving Morse code(honed by eighteen-hour bouts of practice) earned him a slot as a junioroperator. The Civil War was on, and telegraphers were in great demand. And soEdison was launched in the world of telegraphy, invention, money, and gettingahead.Edison’s work with the telegraph, telephone, and the amazing talking phonographhad given him an excellent grasp of the current primitive state of electricalknowledge. Such was his reputation that he was on retainer to Western Union for$400 a month. He had invested much of his considerable earnings in Menlo Park,determined to have at hand everyone and anything he might need to create andwork out the practical problems that interested him. As one interviewer noted,“The keynote of [Edison’s] work is commercial utility. He asks himself when anew idea is suggested, ‘Will this be valuable from the industrial point of view?Will it do something important better than existing methods?’”5[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts5a] Now Edison, that marvel of hardwork, imagination, and enterprise, having seen Wallace and Farmer’s dynamos andarc lights, was, in September of 1878, concentrated on the electric light. Theprevious spring, a reporter and artist from the New York Daily Graphic had madethe pilgrimage to Menlo Park to “see Edison and his wonderful inventions.” Whenthey entered the laboratory to sketch scenes for their readers, they found along open room humming with activity: “The first floor is occupied by scribesand bookkeepers in one end, and at the other some ten or twelve skillful workersin iron, who, at anvil and forge, lathe and drill, are noisily engaged in makingpatterns and models for the genius of the establishment. His iron ideas, intangled shapes, are scattered and piled everywhere; turning lathes are thicklyset on the floor and the room is filled with the screech of tortured metal.“Upstairs we climb, to a room the size of the building, with twenty windows onsides and ends. It is walled with shelves of bottles like an apothecary shop,thousands of bottles of all sizes and colors. In the corner is a cabinet organ.On benches and tables are batteries of all descriptions, microscopes, magnifyingglasses, crucibles, retorts, an ash-covered forge, and all the apparatus of achemist.”6 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts6a]Menlo Park offered cheap real estate and blessed peace and quiet. Edison’sright-hand men and many of his workers had moved out with him from Newark, wherehe had opened a lab and workshops in 1870. Preeminent were Charles Batchelor, adark-bearded English mechanic who had learned unholy patience and exquisitemotor skills in Manchester’s textile mills, and John Kruesi, a master Swissmachinist who sported a huge drooping mustache over a thick black beard.Kruesi’s task, at which he excelled, was to translate Edison’s rough sketchesinto high-quality working models. When Edison was on to a problem, there was noday or night, just hours in which to work, as his long-suffering, neglected wifeand two small children well knew. Though his family lived in a wooden house justa few hundred yards down a plank road, Edison could rarely pull himself awaylong enough to dine at home, instead fueling himself on yet another slice ofpie, preferably apple. Most of the men roomed across the way at Mrs. Jordan’sboardinghouse.For forty years, scientists and inventors—American and English, French, Russian,Belgian—had been largely frustrated in their efforts to create a practicalindoor electric light, some kind of enclosed glass globe that could safely andbrightly glow. Edison himself had toyed briefly with both arc and incandescentlights in November 1877, but with little success. He would later recall, “Theresults of the carbon experiments, and also of the boron and siliconexperiments, were not considered sufficiently satisfactory, when looked at inthe commercial sense, to continue them at that time, and they were laid aside.”7[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts7a] Now on this September Saturday—amere week since his tour of Wallace’s shop—Edison pronounced with characteristichubris to the reporter from the New York Sun, who had come out to Menlo Park,that he, Edison, would be the one to succeed with the electric light (andmore—far more!) where all others had failed. He, Edison, would be the Prometheuswho would divine the secrets of this mysterious agency and light up America andthe world. He had—in one inspired week—just invented the first practicalincandescent light bulb, one where a wire inside the glass bulb glowedbrilliantly as electricity flowed through it.So on September 16, 1878, the New York Sun duly proclaimed: EDISON’S NEWESTMARVEL. SENDING CHEAP LIGHT, HEAT, AND POWER BY ELECTRICITY. As befitted one whoas yet had not secured his patents, Edison was understandably vague on thedetails of his historic breakthrough, except to say, “I have obtained it [thelight] through an entirely different process than that from which scientistshave sought to secure it. They have all been working in the same groove. When itis known how I have accomplished my object everyone will wonder how they neverthought of it…. I can produce a thousand—aye, ten thousand lights from onemachine.”8 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts8a] Edison’s great butunrevealed breakthrough was, says biographer and Edison scholar Paul Israel, “athermal regulator to prevent the incandescing element of his lamp frommelting.”9 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts9a] Edison was proclaimingthese breakthroughs—a workable light bulb and a whole electrical lightingnetwork—with a large dollop of showmanship, intended to attract investors andscare off rivals.Edison proclaimed to the New York Sun reporter, “I can light the entire lowerpart of New York city, using a 500 horse power engine. I propose to establishthese light centres in Nassau street, whence wires can be run up town as far asthe Cooper Institute, down to the Battery, and across to both rivers … the samewire that brings the light to you … will also bring power and heat … you maycook your food.” Edison’s vision had already vaulted beyond mere light bulbsinto a glorious and immediate future of electrical grandiosity: Not only did hehave in hand a workable incandescent light bulb (that would in short order makegas lighting obsolete), he would create an entire electrical power system. In abrief editorial, the Sun’s famous editor Charles Dana wryly allowed as how “ifEdison is not deceiving himself, we are on the eve of surprising experiences.”10[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts10a] Yet Dana, whose early years ofpoverty made him and his popular two-penny daily ardent champions of theworkingman, did not view Edison’s Promethean assertions as worthy of his livelyfront page, faithfully devoted to murder, mayhem, and disaster. Electricitywould not displace detailed coverage of the yellow fever plague ravaging theSouth, or the riveting trial for the “murder of Mrs. Jesse Billing,” or theprevious day’s FINDING A CORPSE IN A BARREL IN A SECLUDED RAVINE, or the threeboys who drowned in a coal chute.With Edison suddenly promising cheap and easy lighting within mere months, hisattorney, Grosvenor P. Lowrey, leapt into action. Within the week, he informedEdison that he was rounding up investors for Edison’s new venture. Developingpractical electricity would be costly, far beyond the inventor’s own resources.On October 3, 1878, Edison wrote, “Friend Lowrey: Go ahead. I shall agree tonothing, promise nothing and say nothing to any person, leaving the whole matterto you. All I want at present is to be provided with funds to push the lightrapidly.”11 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts11a] As reportersstreamed down to Menlo Park and Edison insisted that he was on the verge oflighting up Manhattan, Lowrey established the Edison Electric Light Company onOctober 16, 1878, with 3,000 shares of stock. Edison was assigned 2,500 sharesworth $250,000 for his electric light patents—those pending and in thefuture—leaving 500 shares worth $50,000. These were subscribed to by the initialinvestors, including Lowrey; three of his law partners; Western Union presidentNorvin Green; Drexel, Morgan partner Egisto Fabbri; capitalists Tracy Edson andJames Banker; financier Robert L. Cutting Jr.; and last but not least, HamiltonMcK. Twombly, son-in-law of the immensely wealthy William H. Vanderbilt.While Lowrey was rounding up capital for Edison’s light, the Wizard of MenloPark was busily hosting reporters, and by mid-October he was actuallydemonstrating his much bruited new light bulb. The New York Sun reporter whoreturned again to Menlo Park to bear witness wrote reverently, “There was thelight, clear, cold, and beautiful. The intense brightness was gone. There wasnothing irritating to the eye. The mechanism was so simple and perfect that itexplained itself. The strip of platinum that acted as burner did not burn. Itwas incandescent. It threw off a light pure and white. It was set in agallows-like frame, but it glowed with the phosphorescent effulgence of the starAltaire…. It seemed perfect.”12 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts12a]Edison could be equally rhapsodic about his aborning incandescent light bulb:“There will be neither blaze nor flame, no singeing or flickering; it will bewhiter and steadier than any known lamp. It will give no obnoxious fumes norsmoke, will prove one of the healthiest lights possible, and will not blackenceilings or furniture.” Of course, what Edison didn’t mention about his wondrousnew light was that it lasted only an hour or two. It was still far fromcommercially viable.In an age of great formality, when gentlemen wore fine Prince Albert suits, aproper stiff collar and cravat, and a shiny silk top hat when venturing forth inpublic, Edison preferred to play the unschooled hick at Menlo Park, affectingrumpled blue flannel workman’s suits, silk neckerchiefs, a simple clothskullcap, and solid boots. In truth, Edison was a voracious and penetratingreader, hungry for knowledge and possessing an amazing memory. His earlydeafness only made him more likely to lose himself in a book. At age twenty-one,while still working as a telegrapher for Western Union in Boston, Edison hadavidly consumed all three volumes of British scientist Michael Faraday’sExperimental Researches in Electricity and Magnetism. Faraday became animmediate hero, a poor London boy who rose to the top ranks of science on hisbrains and hard work. To Edison, Faraday had been living proof that the secretsof nature could be revealed through determined experiment and astuteobservation.That November, Edison immersed himself in journals and books about the gaslighting industry, knowing that he had to understand what kind of system hewould be challenging. Since the 1840s, the quarter of Americans who lived inreasonably big towns and cities had had access to gas lighting. The greatmajority of the nation, however, still lived out on farms and in villages andused cheap tallow candles, whale oil, or kerosene for light. Only in biggercities was it economical for gas made from coal to be piped along under thestreets, where it lit up street lamps, and from the street into stores,theaters, factories, and homes, traveling just as water did, through specialpipes. Meters recorded usage. Of course, each gaslight had to be individuallylighted and snuffed out and its glass globe cleaned. Each gas flame flickeredand gave off, as it burned, small quantities of ammonia and sulfur, as well ascarbon dioxide and water. Over time, these fumes visibly blackened not just theencasing glass globe, but a room’s interior decor. Crowded, closed rooms lit bygas could quickly become deficient in oxygen and make people feel ill.Electricity had none of these drawbacks.Beloved as Edison was by an awed and respectful public, his cocky ways andphenomenal early success had deeply irked his many scientific and inventingrivals, especially the gentlemen of academia. As the press breathlessly parrotedEdison’s overblown light bulb claims, the scientists responded with disdainfuldisbelief. In Britain, Professor Silvanus Thompson scoffed in a public lecture,“We have heard a great deal of late of Mr. Edison’s discovery of a means ofindefinitely dividing the light. I cannot tell you what his method may be, butthis I can tell you, that any system depending on incandescence will fail.”Another prominent English electrician, John T. Sprague, declared, “Neither Mr.Edison nor anyone else can override the well-known laws of Nature, and when heis made to say that the same wire which brings you light will also bring youpower and heat, there is no difficulty in seeing that more is promised than canpossibly be performed. The talk about cooking food by heat derived fromelectricity is absurd.”13 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts13a] Theywere joined by their countryman and fellow electrical scientist William Preece,who jeered that “a subdivision of the electric light is an absolute ignisfatuus.” The Latin phrase meant literally “foolish fire,” but it was an evenworse insult because it referred to almost imaginary swamp gases.14[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts14a] But such was Edison’s worldwidereputation that gas stocks in the United States and En-gland plunged in value.British Parliament tried to reassure investors by appointing a committee toreview Edison’s claims. The conclusion: Edison’s wild dreams might be “goodenough for our transatlantic friends” but were “unworthy of the attention ofpractical or scientific men.”15 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts15a]Meanwhile, back at Menlo Park, where only the regular passing of PennsylvaniaRailroad trains disturbed the bucolic tranquillity, Edison was settling intowhat he now appreciated was a far more difficult task than he had imagined.Swept up in his Promethean dream, Edison worked feverishly amid the batteriesand bottles, seeking the ideal, long-burning filament, the properly shapedglass, the perfect atmosphere within that glass. Because he was inventing notjust a light bulb, but a whole electrical power network to run those lightbulbs, he was already thinking about the problem in terms of what made economicsense. Very early on, Edison had realized that—contrary to common electricalwisdom—he should be seeking to create incandescence with a very high-resistancematerial. Those inventors who had walked the light bulb path previously had allveered toward the path of low-resistance materials. But, always conscious ofultimate network costs, Edison concluded that the only way to diminish thehorrific cost of copper wire for transmission was to run very low currentsthrough thin copper wires. According to Ohm’s law, first formulated by a Germanphysicist in 1827 and as yet little understood or honored, the magnitude of theelectrical current flowing in a conductor (amperes) was equal to theelectromotive force (this being the pressure or volts) divided by the resistanceto the current, the resistance being measured as ohms. So Edison calculated thatif he was going to run a low current (of 1 or 2 amps) through his thin copperwires to save money, he would have to develop a high-resistance light bulb (200ohms) operating at a relatively low voltage (110 volts). When he haddemonstrated his breakthrough bulb in mid-October to the journalists, itfeatured a thin incandescent spiral of platinum inside an orange-size glassglobe atop a thin neck. And, indeed, it gave a quite satisfactory light—but onlyfor an hour or so.The truth was, Edison was having trouble finding a reliable high-resistancefilament. He was getting disenchanted with platinum, which took high heat wellbut was fragile and simply did not burn for all that long. So he plugged away,looking for something better. But just as he had made the important realizationthat high resistance was key, so too had he discovered that the greater thevacuum inside the light bulb, the longer and better the filament burned.Therefore much time and energy were applied to developing better vacuum pumps.By February of 1879, Edison was almost completely preoccupied with finding theperfect high-resistance material and the ideal vacuum. Originally, he assumed hewould use William Wallace’s direct current generator to light up his lamps. Butjust as he had concluded that in order to slash copper costs he would need lowcurrents pulsating invisibly over his wires and a high-resistance filament, nowhe realized he must have more powerful generators to supply the necessaryhorsepower for the many thousands of light bulbs he envisioned radiating theircool, quiet glow in Manhattan’s gloomy offices and brownstones. In his usualmethodical way, Edison had ordered the five best existing dynamos and begunmaking improvements, homing in on how the armatures were wound and then the sizeand shape of the all-important magnets.Grosvenor P. Lowrey, meanwhile, had been importuning Edison to let him escorthis increasingly restive Wall Street investors out to Menlo Park to seefirsthand his wonderful progress. After all, Edison felt free to brag tojournalists that he was making this or that marvelous breakthrough. They alsoknew he had already spent prodigious sums—of their money. In January, Edison hadwritten a friend, “The fund I have here is very rapidly exhausted as it is veryexpensive experimenting. I bought last week $3,000 worth of copper rods alone,and it will require $18,000 worth of copper to light the whole of Menlo park 1⁄2mile radius.” At the same time, rumors were circulating that Edison washopelessly bogged down. So, on the raw, chill evening of Monday, March 26,Edison played host to the money men. Lowrey and the financiers trooped off thetrain and up to a trim new brick building. There Edison met them in the warmthof the elegant office and welcomed them into the upstairs library, allfurnished—at Lowrey’s insistence—in the finest cherrywood furniture. Wall Streetmillionaires and other important visitors required more than a shack.Edison spoke for half an hour or so about progress on various fronts: a betterfilament—platinum plus iridium, tighter vacuum, improved DC dynamo. Then he ledthe way through the blustery raw evening to the nearby laboratory. It was amoonless night, very dark out, ideal for Edison to display his platinum bulbs inthe pitch-black lab. The New York Herald reporter described twelve incandescentbulbs in the large machine shop doing the work of eighteen gas burners: “Thelight given was clear, white and steady, pleasant to the eye.”16[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts16a] So the money men saw that Edisonwas making progress, and the journalist from the Herald duly reported, “All weremuch pleased with the result.” Yet the hard truth was that even the improvedplatinum light bulb—despite Edison’s assertions to reporters that it was readyfor the world—was nowhere close to fully functional. Nor had Edison yet improvedany of the DC dynamos enough to show one off as his own. While this show wascalculated to convince the naysayers that Edison was on the verge of buildinghis central generating station in downtown Manhattan and lighting up New Yorkwith electricity, he had a great deal more work to do.By late April of 1879, the Menlo Park gang had all reason for genuine cheer, forthey had at last devised a superior dynamo whose appearance earned theaffectionate nickname the “long-legged Mary-Ann.” Edison’s machine had a pair ofthree-foot-tall iron poles (hence, the legs). What was really new was placing“the dynamo’s armature between the poles of a powerful, oversized magnet … aconcentrated source of Faraday’s lines of magnetic force.”17[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts17a] Edison’s generator was farsuperior to existing electrical generators, more efficient, and capable oflighting many light bulbs. He did this by “making the internal resistance muchsmaller than the external load, rather than having equal internal and externalresistance,” as was the norm.18 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts18a]But what light bulb? For all of Edison’s advances in understanding resistanceand vacuum, practical success on the filament remained maddeningly elusive. Allthrough the spring and summer, the Menlo Park gang laboriously tinkered in fitsand starts with endless variations of the platinum-filament bulb. In August, theyoung German immigrant glassblower Ludwig Boehm joined the crew, installing hisbellows and glassblowing table in a corner. A dandyish lad, he wore pince-nezand was quick to remind others that he had studied with the great German masterHeinrich Geissler. At a time when the Menlo gang was starting to feel thewearying effects of months of frustration, Boehm’s lively zither playingprovided a pleasant diversion on warm evenings.As October rolled around and the air grew brisk and the large ash tree outsidethe laboratory shed its leaves, Edison and Charles Batchelor began experimentingwith baked carbon filaments, the first ones being made from kerosene lampblackthat was rolled into reed-thin strips, carefully coiled, and then gentlycarbonized in a furnace. During the testing of these lamps, Batchelor was alwaysassisted by young Francis Jehl, who was in charge of making sure the batterieswere fresh and full of power. Jehl also had the slow and tedious ten-hour taskof evacuating (with the unwieldy vacuum pump) as much air as possible from eachnew carbon-filament bulb tested. Then, on October 22, Batchelor wrote in theextremely detailed Menlo Park lab notebooks, “We made some very interestingexperiments on straight carbons made from cotton thread.”19[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts19a] A plain cotton thread had beenbaked in the special carbonizing oven, installed gingerly in the filamentholders, and fitted into one of Boehm’s handblown pear-shaped bulbs; then thebottom was closed and the air in the bulb was slowly, slowly pumped out by Jehl.When attached to the batteries and turned on, this lamp showed resistance above100 ohms. Moreover, these thread-filament bulbs burned for two and three hours,a signal improvement over platinum. Batchelor pressed on, systematically testingeleven other fiber variations—“thread rubbed with tarred lampblack,” “softpaper,” “fine thread plaited together 6 strands,” “cotton soaked in tar(boiling) & put on.”At 1:30 in the morning, Batchelor and Jehl, watched by Edison, began on theninth fiber, a plain carbonized cotton-thread filament (in a horseshoe shape)set up in a vacuum glass bulb. They attached the batteries, and the bulb’s softincandescent glow lit up the dark laboratory, the bottles lining the shelvesreflecting its gleam. As had many another experimental model, the bulb glowedbright. But this time, the lamp still shone hour after hour through that night.The morning came and went, and still the cotton-thread filament radiated itsincandescent light. Lunchtime passed and the carbonized cotton fiber stillglowed. At 4:00 P.M. the glass bulb cracked and the light went out. Fourteen anda half hours! Francis Upton, of the soulful dark eyes and graduate degrees, theone Edison man trained in math and physics, now began evaluating the electricalproperties—the improved filament and superior vacuum—of this most promisingexperimental lamp. On November 4, Edison applied for the light bulb patent thatwould catapult him to even greater fame—the carbonized cotton-threadhorseshoe-shaped filament burning inside a pear-shaped bulb largely voided ofair.Edison now settled in with his unlit cigar and his verdigris microscope,systematically examining hundreds of other prospective filament fibers. Thosewhose structure looked promising he passed over to the genial Charles Batchelor,whose great patience and wonderful dexterity helped the Edison lab workmethodically through Chinese and Italian raw silk, horsehair, teak, spruce,boxwood, cork, celluloid, parchment, and New Zealand flax, to name but a few.But most memorable and most amusing were the hairs harvested for possiblefilaments from the “luxurious beards” of Swiss machinist John Kruesi and aScotsman from Michigan. Recalls Jehl, “Bets were placed with much gusto by thesupporters of the two men, and many arguments held over the rival merits oftheir beards.”20 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts20a] Kruesi’scarbonized beard hair filament flamed out first, making him the loser of thefiber “derby,” a loss followed by much good-natured grumbling about unfairdiscrepancies in currents. Ultimately, carbonized cardboard emerged that fall asthe best of the possible filaments—even better than the carbonized cotton—andproduction was begun.The whole atmosphere at Menlo Park quickened during November and early Decemberof 1879, for their official public display was to be New Year’s Eve. They hadtheir light bulb. They had their generator, the “long-legged Mary-Ann.” Now theyordered steam engines to power them. While these were the major components ofthe system, Edison also had had to invent and manufacture dozens of other parts,including switches, fuses, distribution lines, regulators, and fixtures. WesternUnion agreed to send out men to help with the electrical wiring. The everfaithful Lowrey was kept informed. (Edison, former ace telegrapher, himselfoften personally tap-tap-tapped his telegraphic communications to Lowrey’sManhattan office.) Flush with success, Edison was gearing up for theall-important public lighting display, the radiant refutation of all hisacademic naysayers. More important, he knew he needed to woo back his surly WallStreet investors so they would reopen their wallets for the next phase, creationof a prototype of the New York electrical network. Rumors in the New York presswere rampant, for after all, travelers in the Pennsylvania Railroad trainspassing at night began to report brilliant lights gleaming through the windowsof Menlo Park edifices. Edison’s colleague Francis Upton wrote jubilantly to hisfather that December of 1879, “The light is still prosperous; I have had sixburners in my [Menlo Park] house during the past week and illuminated my parlorfor the benefit of a party of visitors from New York. The exhibition was asuccess. Mr. Edison’s and my house were the only ones illuminated. There will bea great sensation when the light is made known to the world for it does so muchmore than anyone expects can be done.”21[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts21a]Edison, who had always been easily available to any reporter looking for astory, now put off all requests. He allowed access only to his favorite,Marshall Fox of the important and influential New York Herald, a Republicandaily preeminent in foreign news, expensive to purchase at three cents, andconsequently read only by the best people. But the condition was that Foxpublish the article, which Upton would help edit, only when Edison gave thego-ahead. Yet in true journalistic fashion, Fox broke the story as soon aspossible. Thus, on Sunday, December 21, 1879, readers of the Herald opened theirpapers to find a full-page story headlined EDISON’S LIGHT—THE GREAT INVENTOR’STRIUMPH IN ELECTRIC ILLUMINATION—A SCRAP OF PAPER—IT MAKES A LIGHT, WITHOUT GASOR FLAME, CHEAPER THAN OIL—SUCCESS IN A COTTON THREAD. “Edison’s electriclight,” wrote Fox, “incredible as it may appear, is produced from a tiny stripof paper that a breath would blow away. Through this little strip of paper ispassed an electric current, and the result is a bright, beautiful light, likethe mellow sunset of an Italian autumn…. And this light, the inventor claims,can be produced cheaper than that from the cheapest oil.”Edison’s investors remained chary. Egisto Fabbri, the Drexel, Morgan partner,had journeyed down to Menlo Park while Fox was hanging about preparing hisarticle. He had seen Upton’s and Edison’s plain wooden houses “illuminated,” aswell as the laboratory, but Fabbri still harbored memories of previous overblownstatements by the ever optimistic Edison. With the New York papers full ofstories about the light and the New Year’s Eve official debut looming, Fabbriwrote Edison on December 26, “I suggest to you the wisdom & the businessnecessity of giving the whole system of indoor & outdoor lighting a full test ofcontinuous work for a week, day & night, before inviting the public to come andlook for themselves…. Any disappointment would be extremely damaging andprobably more so than may appear to you as a scientific man.”22[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts22a]In truth, it was too late. With the Herald’s article, the word was quite out.Each subsequent afternoon and evening, flocks of electricity sightseers crowdedoff specially scheduled Pennsylvania Railroad trains or pulled up in the crudestof farm wagons and the most luxurious of broughams, carriages equipped withcoachmen and gleaming pairs. There, as the freezing December evening envelopedthe snow-clad Jersey countryside, and clouds scudded across the black night sky,the visitors would head through the dark toward the bright laboratory, there topush through and gaze in awe at the magical display. The official publicunveiling was December 31, 1879, New Year’s Eve. And that evening, as the 1870sbecame the 1880s, three thousand people poured in to Menlo Park, ignoring thestormy weather, to see the miracle of incandescence.Despite Fabbri’s concerns about premature displays and humiliating failures,Edison’s light was a smashing success, a fabulous vindication. He had, aspromised, divided the electric light. Reported a breathless New York Herald,“The laboratory was brilliantly illuminated with twenty-five electric lamps, theoffice and counting room with eight, and twenty others were distributed in thestreet leading to the depot and in some adjoining houses. The entire system wasexplained in detail by Edison and his assistants, and the light subjected to avariety of tests…. Many had come in the expectation of seeing a dignified,elegantly dressed person, and were much surprised to find [Edison] a simpleyoung man attired in the homeliest manner, using for his explanations not highsounding technical terms, but the plainest and simplest language.” Inside thelaboratory, important men sporting elegant evening wear, accompanied by women infashionable silk gowns with short fur jackets and muffs, pressed through thecrowds of country boys in checked suits and derbies to see the electricityturned on and off, to gaze in wonder at the glowing light captured in apear-shaped glass bulb.The triumphant display of the new electric light impressed the New Yorkinvestors sufficiently that they parted with a further $57,568 to underwriteEdison’s next phase. Now began the great push to transform Menlo Park’sjury-rigged system that dazzled crowds of electrical tourists for a couple ofweeks into a truly commercial network that would function reliably in thedemanding hurly-burly of New York and still compete in price with gas. Edison’splan was to create a miniature lighting network in the still-frozen fields inand around his laboratory, there to test out his plan to generate electricity ina central station and then send it forth to the world via insulated copper wiresburied just below the city streets in (still to be dug) sunken subways. Oncethose insulated copper wires reached a building, they would just be run throughthe existing gas pipes into existing gas lamps, where light bulbs would beattached. As the exhilaration of New Year’s Eve subsided, the hard truth ofMenlo Park in the early days of January 1880 was the vast task before them, forevery single component required major improvements. To that end, Edison againdoubled his laboratory workforce, bringing it up to sixty men.Edison scholar Paul Israel notes that when Edison built his Menlo Parklaboratory, it was the “largest private laboratory in the United States andcertainly the largest devoted to invention.” Edison’s unique access to bigcorporate money—first through contracts with Western Union and then through WallStreet light bulb money—gave him an enormous advantage over his rivals. WhenEdison embarked on his electrical quest, Israel points out, he was very much a“traditional though highly ingenious inventor, working with two or three closeassistants and a few skilled experimental machinists…. By the beginning of 1880,as he turned from basic research to the development of a commercial system …Edison had begun to resemble the modern director of research and development….And like the modern research director, Edison depended on the support ofcorporate capital. While Edison the individual is celebrated as the inventor ofthe electric light, it is the less visible corporate organization of thelaboratory and business enterprise that enabled him to succeed.”23[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts23a] Edison was inventing not justthe light bulb, but a new kind of relationship—however prickly anddifficult—between corporate capital and scientific creativity.The first order of business was perfecting the light bulb, whose brightlyshining carbonized cardboard filament may have thrilled young and old, rube andcity slicker, but simply was not reliable for use day in, day out. The filamentsgenerally burned out after only three hundred hours or so, a big improvement butstill not enough. Moreover, rival light bulb inventor William Sawyer, when hesaw Edison’s patent for the carbonized cardboard bulb, promptly filed aninterference suit, pointing out that he had already filed a patent for a lightbulb with a cardboard filament. So Edison had every reason to invent yet abetter light bulb. “Now I believe that somewhere in God Almighty’s workshop,”Edison was said to have uttered, “there is a vegetable growth with geometricallyparallel fibers suitable to our use. Look for it. Paper is manmade and not goodfor filaments.”24 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts24a] Once again,the patient Batchelor sat hour after hour, night after night, at the lab table,testing all kinds of fibrous natural substances. Months passed with nodefinitive breakthroughs.Finally, on April 21, 1880, the digging of the electrical “subways” began.Spring had come to the lovely Jersey countryside, and the heavy clay soil hadfinally warmed up. Workmen wielding plows and shovels began excavating a systemof long, narrow ditches that fanned out from the direct current generatingstation, ran along Menlo Park’s few muddy streets, and then headed out to thesurrounding fields. For his next great public demonstration of his electricnetwork, Edison planned to illuminate all of Menlo Park with four hundredincandescent lights arrayed along eight miles. (He had solved the problem oflights arrayed in a series—as they were in arc lighting—where one burned-outlight would break the whole circuit, by rearranging the circuit into ladderlikeparallels; this meant that the electricity could be routed along individual“rungs,” thus circumventing a light bulb that had been switched off or hadburned out.)The subways carried the insulated copper wires cradled in narrow woodenconductor boxes, which were coated with tar to protect against moisture anddecay and then enclosed with a top. Once the wires were laid, the conductorboxes were sealed and the trenches refilled. Day after day, the men dug andinstalled, as the days lengthened and the strange broiling heat of May gave wayto a mercifully cool summer. By mid-July, the men had dug, installed, andcovered five miles.image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_006_r1.jpg] image[images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_007_r1.jpg]At this point, Francis Upton began testing the lines, only to find “some of thecircuits are very badly insulated and all more or less defective.” One of thenewcomers to the lab wondered why in the world all this had been done by“inexperienced men” and “without being required to test a single circuit or wireuntil the entire work is finished.”25[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts25a] Now all the ditches would haveto be opened up. But the real problem was devising decent insulation, a toppriority. Over the next few months, new insulation was twice reapplied and thewires twice reburied. Then Edison and his men would wait for the sky to darkenand the next summer rain to come soak through the earth. And again, for a secondand a third time, the insulation failed. Through it all, Edison was his usualsanguine self, wandering about chewing on his cigar, vest half-buttoned, solvingthis problem and that, conferring with Batchelor and Upton, keeping Lowreyinformed. He slept a few hours here or there. Edison’s goal was to have hisManhattan prototype ready for public display by the Christmas holidays.Always hanging over Edison’s head was the cost of copper, the biggest and mostdaunting expense for his central station plan. The cost of copper had inspiredhis invention of the high-resistance light bulb. But even that huge savingswould not be enough if he was to match, much less undercut, the cost of gaslighting. In the summer of 1880, even as the “subways” were being laid out againand again, Edison had one of his profound breakthroughs, coming up with a“feeder and main” system of distribution that mimicked—under the streets—the newparallel circuits to be used within buildings. This brilliant new approach wouldcut copper costs to one-eighth the earlier estimates.Essentially, instead of one or two very thick (and costly) copper trunkscarrying electricity forth and then branching off to each individual building,Edison proposed a network of much thinner multiple “feeder” copper wires comingfrom the central station DC dynamo and intersecting with many small mains thatlit large clusters of lights, thereby eliminating the bulk of the copper. Whenthis elegant and simple answer to problems of cost and maintaining pressure wasdemonstrated in England, someone asked the brilliant Glasgow physicist SirWilliam Thomson, knighted for his critical role in the practical success of thetransatlantic cable, why no one else had thought of it. He said, “The onlyanswer I can think of is that no one else is Edison.”26[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts26a]image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_008_r1.jpg] image[images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_009_r1.jpg]Meanwhile, the search for the ideal filament had been slowly advancing. Duringthat weirdly hot spring, the lab was fully focused on the possibilities of bast,the woody outer layer of flax or hemp. Meanwhile, Edison was busy installing hislight bulb factory in an old wooden barn across the railroad tracks, for hewould need many hundreds of light bulbs for his New Year’s display. Soonthereafter, he would need thousands of light bulbs stockpiled for his futureManhattan customers. Then, on July 10, according to Edison lore and legend,while the ditch diggers were laboring away to finish their eight miles oftrenches, Edison was sitting in the lab idly fanning himself against the stillsummer air with a bamboo fan. He looked at the fan, cut off a long thin piecefor a filament, examined it under his microscope, and handed it over to betested. The results seemed promising, and better-quality bamboo was obtained,carbonized, and tried. By August 2, the lab was fully focused on bamboo. Edisonscholar Paul Israel debunks this legend as “plain wrong,” for the lab notebooksshow an order of bamboo coming in July 7. Moreover, Edison had conducted carefulliterature searches, and it was these, not the heat, that put him on to bamboo.Throughout 1880, Edison’s experimental inventor’s laboratory had been steadilytransformed into a production and testing facility for light bulbs, dynamos,conducting wires, and insulation. Each component of the new lighting network hadto be designed, tested, redesigned, and retested. “Everything is so new thateach step is in the dark,” Edison said. “I have to make the dynamos, the lamps,the conductors, and attend to a thousand details the world never hears of.” Thetruth was, this was completely new and complex technology, and no one reallyknew how long it would take to make it work or what it might ultimately cost. InMenlo Park, September had rolled around and vast flocks of birds at timesdarkened the broad country sky as they began heading south. Now, for the fourthtime the workmen began to lay the wires in the eight miles of conduits. And atlast, insulated with a compound that involved several layers of muslin and then“parafine, tar, Linseed oil and Asphaltum,” the wires remained sound when therain came.27 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts27a] On Monday, November1, a blustery cold evening, the first Menlo Park streetlights began to glow,their subtle radiance coming from electricity generated by a “long-leggedMary-Ann” in Edison’s central station and then flashed through the copper wiresburied in the subways. Soon Edison’s and Upton’s houses were connected to thecentral station, as were the miles of lights running up the hamlet’s centralplank road and then far out into the golden autumn fields.The very next day was Election Day, and by the next night, when it was knownthat Republican James Garfield had won the presidency by a hairbreadth, Edisoncelebrated his party’s victory by lighting up a whole turnpike of lights nearthe passing railroad. President-elect Garfield was, like Edison, a self-made manwho had overcome his family’s penury. A tall, handsome, affable scholar,Garfield had been president of Hiram College in Ohio and a member of Congresswhen the Civil War broke out. He quickly organized a brigade for the Union Army,becoming a war hero at the battle of Chickamauga. Elected a U.S. senator by theOhio state legislature, Garfield resigned his army commission at PresidentAbraham Lincoln’s request. By 1880 Garfield was a powerful and respectedsenator, but he was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate only onthe thirty-third ballot. As Garfield prepared to enter the grand world stage, sodid Edison. Each hoped to make an important mark on a fast-growing nationfinally feeling prosperous again.Edison, despite two arduous years rife with setbacks, mounting skepticism, andpointed sarcasm about his being far behind his own original announced scheduleof mere months, was his ever blithe, hubristic self. Thus he was able to writeto his European business associate Theodore Puskas in October 1880—before theMenlo Park system was even up and running smoothly—that he could “safely saythat the Edison Electric Light Company of America will have one stationestablished and in full working order lighting the lower portion of the City ofNew York before the first of May 1881.”28[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts28a] Such was Edison’s fame in thosedays that there were continual visitors wanting to meet the great man. So whenthe beautiful French tragedienne the “divine” Sarah Bernhardt performed in NewYork during a national tour, she, too, longed to meet “le grand Edison.” Edisoninvestor and director Robert L. Cutting was more than happy to escort theglamorous Madame Bernhardt out to Menlo Park, arranging a special train after anevening performance. At 2:00 A.M. on December 5, she stepped off the private carinto the raw rural cold of Menlo Park, thrilled by the soft glow of theincandescent lights lining the plank road. Edison, who showed little interest inwomen (including his own wife), was smitten by this glorious, vivacious creaturein her exquisite French gown with its voluminous, swishing skirts. “She was aterrific ‘rubberneck,’” he would later remember. “She jumped all over themachinery, and I had one man especially to guard her dress. She wanted to knoweverything. She would speak in French, and Cutting would translate into English.She stayed there about an hour and a half.”29[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts29a] In the comfortable library,Edison held her hand and explained the secrets of the phonograph. She recitedfavorite passages into it from Racine’s Phèdre and was amazed to hear her voice.When the great inventor flashed the hundreds of outdoor lights on and off in thepitch dark of the early morning, on and off, on and off, she clapped with pureGallic delight. Finally, she and Cutting had to return to New York. “C’estgrand, c’est magnifique!” she exclaimed in that world-famous voice.30[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts30a]Bernhardt was not the only important visitor Edison entertained that December.The moment was drawing near to conquer the Empire City, for Edison apparentlyenvisioned few further delays. But before he could install an entire electricalsystem from scratch in crowded, noisy, dirty Manhattan, there were a fewpolitical details to master. The Edison investors knew the company needed tosecure City Hall’s permission to dig up Manhattan’s streets, and withnotoriously corrupt Tammany in firm control, one could not be certain what thatmight entail. The ever diplomatic Grosvenor Lowrey quickly arranged a posh andpersuasive evening out in Menlo Park for the city’s Tammany aldermen, hoping todazzle them into quick and friendly action with lights and Lorenzo Delmonico’sfinest catered fare and copious champagne. Numerous reporters tagged along forthe fun. The New York Times reported that as the group got off the train in “thebleak and uninviting place where Mr. Edison has chosen for his home,” thehundreds of electric lights illuminating the plank road to the laboratory andsurrounding fields “cast a soft and mellow light … beautiful to look upon.”Edison, in a sealskin hat, awaited the politicos at the brick office buildingand “grasped the hand of each one as he passed and smiled with all the franknessof a pleased school-boy.”31 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts31a] Theinventor spoke briefly and then led the visitors through the cold, well-litDecember night to the laboratory. There he proudly introduced the newbamboo-filament light bulb, which he said should last six months with normaluse. He then turned off and on various rows of lamps. Next, with one turn of awheel he put out all the 290 outdoor lights aglow in the snowy streets andnearby pastures. Then, with a turn of the handle, Edison brought those 290globes back to glowing life. For men who knew only gaslights that requiredindividual lighting and snuffing, this was something astonishing indeed!After that radiant display, Lowrey and Edison escorted the Tammany crew backthrough the cold to the elegant brick building and Edison’s upstairs library,where the men settled in comfortably. Edison explained why his electric lightwould be as cheap as gas when it became available in the fifty-one blocksbounded by the East River, Spruce, Wall, and Nassau Streets. He boasted a bitabout his 250-some patents granted for electrical innovations. Then, to livenmatters up, he displayed his ever popular phonograph. The reporter from the NewYork Truth noticed that “by this time the city fathers had begun to look quitedry and hungry, and as though refreshments would have looked much more palatableto them than the very scientific display.”32[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts32a] Perhaps their hearts sank whenLowrey proposed they revisit the laboratory. Instead, there beckoned a table aslong as the room, groaning under Delmonico’s aromatic delicacies—turkey, duck,chicken salad, and ham, all to be washed down with the best wines andchampagnes. Soon the aldermen were feeling much more jolly. The city’ssuperintendent of gas, no less, toasted Edison on his success. “Gas,” said thesuperintendent, “is dangerous. It is very easy for a man to go to his hotel,blow out the gas and wake up dead in the morning. There is no danger of a manblowing out the electric light.”33[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts33a]The New York Post observed in its story about the aldermen’s visit, “There arenow six different companies at work introducing electric lights in this city,the lights being known as the Brush, Maxim, Edison, Jablochkoff, Sawyer andFuller (Gramme patents) lights.” Most of these were arc-lighting companies, butrival inventor Hiram Maxim had boldly helped himself to Edison’s incandescentlight bulb (and to Ludwig Boehm, who had defected to the better-paying enemy)and had raced ahead, displaying his new incandescent lighting system in theMercantile Safe Deposit Company’s vaults and reading rooms. Maxim’s system hadbeen up and running for two months already. Such timely competition did nothingto soothe Edison’s money men, who wondered what was keeping their man fromgetting his lights running.The very night the aldermen trooped out to Menlo Park, the Brush ElectricCompany had had its New York debut. At 5:25 P.M., the generators at its centralstation had roared to life and illuminated seventeen powerful new electric arclights, lighting up Broadway for the three-quarters of a mile from Union Squareup to Delmonico’s Restaurant at 26th Street. The New York Evening Post describedthe new arc lights as blazing “with a clear, sharp, bluish light resemblingintense moonlight, with the same deep shadows that moonlight casts.”34[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts34a] When the brilliant arc lightsflashed to life in the cold night, the strolling crowds of fashionable holidayshoppers exclaimed and clapped in admiration. Suddenly, passing horses,streetcars, and omnibuses emerged from the usual gloom of gaslight, uncannilyvisible. One reporter was struck by the “artistic effects” created by this newlight. “A pair of white horses attached to an elegant private carriage outsideof Tiffany’s was illuminated with a brilliancy which, contrasted with the deepblack outline, formed a picture. The great white outlines of the marble stores,the mazes of wire overhead, the throng of moving vehicles.”35[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts35a]Just before the aldermen’s visit, Lowrey had organized a new corporatestructure, the Edison Electric Illuminating Company, comprising much the samedirectors—Western Union and Morgan people—as did the Edison Electric LightCompany. Thomas Edison had been telling Lowrey and his fellow capitalists formonths that he now needed not thousands of dollars, but millions to light uplower Manhattan. But the Wall Street investors were loath to wade any furtherinto Edison’s financial bog, where money swiftly disappeared, never to be seenagain. Where was the lighting system that was to churn out all the profits? So,some years later Edison would explain, “We were confronted by a stupendousobstacle. Nowhere in the world could we obtain any of the items or devicesnecessary for the exploitation of the system. The directors of the EdisonElectric Light Company would not go into manufacturing. Thus forced to the wall,I was forced to go into manufacturing myself.” To one of his New York investors,Edison declared, “Since capital is timid, I will raise and supply it…. The issueis factories or death!”36 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts36a] Toshow he was not kidding, Edison had boldly established the light bulb factoryout at Menlo Park, which by the end of the year was turning out several hundredbulbs daily. This was controlled and financed by Edison himself, who sold EdisonElectric stock and borrowed wherever he could. Again, the nature of the new andlittle understood electrical science and its many unknowns were dictating thesefirst groping corporate arrangements.In February of 1881, Edison and his key staff members began shifting, at longlast, into Manhattan, joining the already legendary cacophony of the EmpireCity, what one guidebook of the era described as “the intense activity andbustle alike visible and audible in all the conditions of its street-life. Thecrush of carriages, drays, trucks, and other vehicles, private and public,roaring and rattling over the stone-paved streets; the crowds of swiftly movingmen walking as if not to lose a second of time, their faces preoccupied andeager; the sidewalks encumbered, without regard to the convenience ofpedestrians, with boxes and bales of goods—in a word, the whole aspect of NewYork in its business portions is a true key to the character of its population,as the most energetic and restless of people.”37[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts37a] By the end of February, Edisonhad signed a lease for the handsome former Bishop Mansion at 65 Fifth Avenue, anornate four-story double brownstone in the city’s most fashionable quarter, justbelow 14th Street.At the highly visible headquarters for the new Edison Electric IlluminatingCompany, Edison quickly rigged up a steam engine and generator and by mid-Aprilhad equipped its tall-ceilinged rooms with numerous “electroliers” (electricchandeliers) and other attractive light fixtures. Illuminated every evening andlong into the wee hours, 65 Fifth Avenue was the glorious and radiant newelectrical reality, where Edison held court most nights. The back parlor servedas his campaign headquarters, complete with a wall-size map of Manhattan and hisdesignated first lighting district. Long before moving into New York, Edison hadthoroughly canvased his prospective “first district” central station electriccustomers and determined that 1,500 were coal-gas customers using twentythousand jets. All this was indicated on the map, along with the planned routesof the subways, switches, and so forth. For his new role as businessman, Edisonmoved up sartorially from his old blue flannel suit to a seedy Prince Albertfrock coat. He was in his usual ebullient spirits: “We’re up in the world now. Iremember ten years ago—I had just come from Boston—I had to walk the streets ofNew York all night because I hadn’t the price of a bed. And now think of it! I’mto occupy a whole house in Fifth Avenue.”38[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts38a]Edison certainly liked to promote this Horatio Alger story that predated thosepopular books, describing himself as arriving in New York an almost pennilessyouth with a great talent for wireless technology and machines. He happened, sohe said, to be in the first days of a lowly job at the Gold Indicator Company,which supplied Wall Street via ticker tapes with the fast-changing price ofgold, when the equipment ground to a halt. As the officers began to panic,Edison examined the silent machine and observed that the trouble was a brokencontact spring. Amid the hysteria, he quickly fixed the problem and was dulypromoted to the important position of technician. And so was launched hisprosperous career as an inventor and improver of telegraphy equipment. Thereality, says Edison scholar Paul Israel, was that while Edison certainlystarted life with few advantages, when he first came to Manhattan he was alreadywell connected and had a respectable—not lowly—job as an engineer, and any moneyproblems were short-lived.When Edison returned to New York this time, he brought with him many of his mainMenlo Park crew, each assigned new and greater responsibilities. Inmid-February, John Kruesi, Edison’s trusted Swiss mechanic, the man who couldfabricate and make almost anything work, had opened the Edison Electric TubeCompany at 65 Washington Street. Kruesi was the general in charge of Edison’stoughest campaign—the manufacture and then physical installation (beneath someof Manhattan’s busiest, filthiest thoroughfares) of fourteen miles ofunderground distribution cables and wires. He would command a big gang of Irishlaborers, many of whom viewed electricity as some evil sprite. They would sharethe nighttime streets with the city’s denizens of the dark, including the greatarmy of rag pickers and their dog-pulled wooden carts, each licensed to rootthrough the daily refuse for salvageable cloth. Kruesi’s longtime Menlo Parkassistant, Charles Dean, was put in charge of the all-important Edison MachineWorks, located in an old ironworks building at 104 Goerck Street near the EastRiver docks on the crowded and noisome Lower East Side. Here in this grimysetting would be perfected and manufactured the workhorses of the Edisonsystem—the generators. Meanwhile, back at Menlo Park, Francis Upton, thescientist, was running the light bulb factory, now churning out a thousandlights a day. These three enterprises were all organized and financed by Edisonor his closest associates.Even as Edison himself settled into Manhattan, his other right-hand man, CharlesBatchelor, sailed off to Paris to launch the Edison European branch. Businessmanager and sometime Edison promoter Edward Johnson headed to England to pushthe Edison light there. Both were to lay the groundwork for the electricalempire Edison had envisioned from the start. Edison was a famous commercial namealready overseas, for he had conducted major European business with his previousinventions. He had existing partners and contacts, and now Batchelor and Johnsonwere to begin launching their famous boss’s biggest enterprise yet—centralelectric stations, as well as isolated or stand-alone electric plants forindividual factories or buildings. The Edison Electric Light Company of Europehad already been formed in January of 1880. So even as Edison labored away inGotham, Charles Batchelor was hard at work in Paris organizing the all-importantEdison system display for that summer’s International Electrical Exhibition.Across the Channel, Johnson began building a demonstration central station thatwould light up the centrally located Holborn Viaduct.Back in New York, down on Wall Street, Edison’s investors were again questioningthe necessity—and the ensuing huge expense—of burying the electric wires in“subways,” something Edison had been determined to do from the start. By the1880s, anyone lifting his or her gaze above street level in the commercialblocks of American cities could barely see the sky for the ugly maze of hundredsof electric wires strung higgledy-piggledy between towering wooden poles. Thewires crisscrossed the streets and were festooned from windows and rooftops asif huge crazed spiders had run amok. A range of fast-expanding industries nowdepended upon electricity (most of it still battery produced)—including thetelegraph, telephone, stock tickers, fire and burglar alarms, and certain smallmanufacturers. In any city, numerous companies vied to provide these variousservices, and where they found customers, they installed more poles—sometowering a hundred feet and higher. Firms came and went, but their wiresremained, deteriorating, fraying, dropping onto one another, and creating shortcircuits. However, all these early electric-based services operated on very lowvoltage direct current derived from large batteries. These wires might cause ashock but would not electrocute a hapless passerby.All that changed with the coming of the new outdoor arc lighting in the 1880s.The extremely high voltage alternating current required to operate theselights—as high as 3,500 volts—made their outdoor wires potentially trulyperilous. The Brush Electric Company had installed its first lights on Broadwaybetween 14th and 34th Streets at the end of 1880, and their brilliant blue whitelight soon earned Broadway its sobriquet “the Great White Way.” New York Citythen contracted with Brush to light more of Broadway and several squares.Hotels, theaters, and other public spots installed arc lights. Brush built threecentral power stations and transmitted its high-power electricity—typically2,000 to 3,000 volts—on wires strung among the existing low-voltage tangle.Edison wanted nothing to do with these mangled nests of live and abandoned wiresand insisted that the Edison system, by burying its wires, would be both safeand reliable. The new Edison system operated on low-voltage direct current,which was efficient and economical only within a half-mile radius of thegenerator. Beyond that distance, the cost of copper wiring became prohibitiveand the energy loss too great. However, Edison prided himself upon the lowvoltages of his system and believed its buried wires added a great margin ofsafety for the general public and his customers.In late April 1881, the Edison Electric Illuminating Company finally receivedcity permission to begin digging its subways. In the meantime, the company hadalready wired about fifty first-district homes and office buildings and promisedthat current would be flowing by the fall, providing them lovely electric lightjust as the winter gloom closed in. The city’s permission came with one deeplyworrying caveat: Five city inspectors—to be paid $25 a week by Edison—wouldmonitor progress. Edison envisioned all kinds of trouble aimed mainly atextracting bribes. But in true Tammany “do no work” fashion, the inspectorsappeared only on Saturday afternoon to collect their pay. Kruesi quickly brokeground with his Irish street crews, working largely at night when the city’smuch maligned street-cleaning crews spread out to remove the two to threemillion pounds of equine manure left behind each day by the city’s 150,000horses. Kruesi soon found that digging down two feet was far more time-consumingand arduous than expected. Edison and Kruesi personally had to install theconnector boxes located every twenty feet. Worse yet, the suppliers of thecopper wiring and the iron pipes (the latter substituting for the originalwooden boxes) had stopped delivering. June was slow going, as it rained everyday but one. Then, on July 2, the Edison men organizing the evening’s subwaywork heard shocking news: President James Garfield, waiting at the Baltimore andPotomac station for a train to the cool of the New Jersey seaside, had been shottwice in the back by an angry job seeker. Still alive, the president wascarefully conveyed to the stifling heat of the White House. The nation prayedthat Garfield would survive this terrible attack.At the time, Edison was scouting the worst slum streets of his first district,looking for a cheap but capacious building to house the heart and soul of hissystem—the central generators. That August, with the summer heat exacerbatingthe usual stench of horse piss and manure, great piles of garbage, and sour beerand sawdust from the ubiquitous bucket shops, Edison purchased 255-57 PearlStreet for $65,000. From this squalid block, Edison’s electricity wouldeventually gently hum forth a half mile in each direction, lighting up theall-important financial district centered on Wall Street and much of newspaperrow. “The Pearl Street Station,” Edison later said, “was the biggest and mostresponsible thing I had ever undertaken. It was a gigantic problem, with manyramifications…. All our apparatus, devices and parts were home-devised andhome-made. Our men were completely new and without central station experience.What might happen on turning a big current into the conductors under the streetsof New York no one could say.”39 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts39a]The Edison dynamos—powered by coal-fired steam engines—produced an initialalternating current electricity that was then gathered from the machine by“commutators” and brushes and turned into a direct current. One of the perennialproblems with these early generators was that the constant friction against thecommutators and brushes meant regular replacement. Every step of the way, myriadtechnical problems arose that had to be resolved. Again and again, the startingdate was postponed.Summer ended and still President Garfield clung to life, a bullet lodged next tohis spinal cord. From the start, reported the New-York Daily Tribune, hisphysicians had told him “he had one chance in a hundred of living. ‘Then we willtake that chance,’ he said. All that mortal man could make of so slender achance was made. His courage never faltered…. For seventy-nine days theagonizing struggle was prolonged.”40[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts40a] On September 6, it was decidedto move the president to Elburon, New Jersey, where he had been heading whenshot. It was, therefore, no great surprise when on the night of September 19 NewYorkers heard church bells start to toll out a doleful dirge. The president wasdead. Vice President Chester A. Arthur was hurriedly sworn in to the nation’shighest office at his Manhattan town house. Englishwoman Iza Hardy, thenvisiting New York, wrote, “The heart of the nation beat with one regret; theword on every lip was, ‘The President is dead.’” A week of mourning followed.“From the highest to the lowest, from Fifth Avenue mansion to the squatter’sshanty, each home hung out its sign of sorrow…. The star-spangled banner,generally looped with crape, floated in all sizes and of all materials from athousand windows; from the little ten-cent paper flag to the imposing patrioticbunting waving from side to side of the road.”41[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts41a] Garfield’s assassin, Charles J.Guiteau, was arraigned October 14, the trial beginning a month later. By the endof the year, as the trial dragged on, the New-York Daily Tribune described it asa “vulgar peep show” where Guiteau, determined to prove he was innocent byreason of insanity, dominated the courtroom with “his drivel, abuse,malevolence, and smudge.” The editors denounced the circus atmosphere as a“disgrace to the country” allowed by a “judge whose backbone seems to be made oftissue paper.”42 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts42a]Edison was deep into his own travails, as he struggled to get all the componentsof his central station up and functioning. The New York press had become farless friendly. On December 2, 1881, The New York Times described in a brief,page eight article that the Edison company “have laid a considerable quantity ofwire, but so far as lighting up the downtown district is concerned, they are asfar away from that as ever.” Winter, snow, and frozen streets brought thedigging to a halt. More months passed with little progress. In an articleentitled “The Edison Dark Lanterns,” The New York Times reported, “Muchgrumbling has been done lately by businessmen and residents of the districtbounded by Nassau, Wall, South, and Spruce streets because there seems noprospect of the Edison Electric Light Company putting in the lights theypromised to have burning by last November.” A grumpy Edison officialacknowledged that only half of the fourteen miles of subways were in place, inpart due to sporadic delivery by suppliers of iron and copper and in partbecause of suspension of work while the ground was frozen. With the advent ofspring, they were working at top pace again. When pressed repeatedly for acompletion date, the Edison officer replied, “All we can say now about theprospects of lighting up is that we are doing our best to get the wire laid,immediately after which we will be able to light the lamps.” Of course, it wasin this month that J. Pierpont Morgan’s Italianate brownstone on Madison Avenuewas first lit up, much to his delight. But his was an isolated electrical plant,not part of the central station. He lived too far north for that service. OnJune 30, Guiteau, “this most despicable of assassins,” was hanged, and he turnedhis awful end at the gallows into a final frenzied display of shrieks and tears.By late August 1882, as the city steamed in the summer heat, Kruesi at long lastled his Irish crews through the final and fourteenth mile.Very quietly, the Edison Electric Illuminating Company began testing its system.No formal announcement was made, but Thomas A. Edison had begun running hisgenerating and distribution system, hooking up various customers, and testingthe lights. The truth was, Edison had momentarily exhausted his penchant forballyhoo. For four years, he had worked as hard as ever he had at any oneproject, and he was understandably nervous that it would actually perform aspromised. Edison was now thirty-five years old, and while his face still lookedas youthful as ever, his thatch of brown hair had turned gray in the years sincehe had blithely and innocently promised to light up all of lower Manhattan withhis platinum bulb and William Wallace’s dynamo. The New York press found outthat the Edison network was being tested when horses passing along Nassau Streetat Fulton “became suddenly electrified, gave a sudden jump, and with a snort,ran off as speedily as possible.” At first the Edison people could not believetheir system was responsible, but a steam-heating company also digging hadindeed broken their iron pipe and shorted the wires. Such minor electricaldisasters were unnerving, for Edison knew that no one could truly say what mighthappen when electricity went coursing forth from Pearl Street. They certainlyhoped it wouldn’t regularly escape to shock the unwary.On September 4, 1882, a pleasant, warm day, a slightly chastened Edison, attiredfor the occasion in a better frock coat and a white, high-crowned derby hat,spent the morning and early afternoon repeatedly checking all aspects of thePearl Street operation, abandoning his collar early on. Just before departingfor Wall Street, where he was going (at long last) to formally launch the EdisonElectric Light Company’s service, the great inventor synchronized his watch withPearl Street employee John Lieb. Now, as the long-awaited event neared, Edisonwalked into the Morgan offices with Edward Johnson, John Kruesi, and a fewothers. J. Pierpont Morgan and many of the directors of the board also gatheredin the burnished Drexel, Morgan offices. Four years of hard work of the mostoriginal, difficult sort and almost $500,000 had brought them to this crucialmoment. Edison had been operating under a pall of skepticism for some time. Andhe knew better than any man present just how many small things could go wrongover at Pearl Street or in his electrical subways to bollix up his company’sformal electrical debut. To break the palpable tension, Johnson joked to Edison,“One hundred dollars they don’t go on!”“Taken!” said Edison. He looked at his pocket watch. It was three o’clock. Themoment of truth was upon them. Over on Pearl Street, John Lieb stood on histiptoes and threw the main circuit breaker. Blocks away in Morgan’s office,Edison closed the switch next to him.“They’re on!” cried the directors. It was a wondrous vindication, for all aroundthem some one hundred incandescent bulbs had glowed softly to life. Threehundred more glowed in nearby offices, delivering an energy visibly superior toflickering, odorous gaslight. It was not until darkness fell, wrote The New YorkTimes, whose Edison lights also came on that day, that “the electric lightreally made itself known and showed how bright and steady it is…. There was avery slight amount of heat from each lamp, but not nearly as much as from a gasburner…. The light was soft, mellow, and grateful to the eye … without aparticle of flicker to make the head ache … the decision was unanimous in favorof the Edison electric lamp as against gas.” In the coming months, another twothousand lights in additional buildings were lighted up. It was not happenstancethat the Edison Electric Light Company’s first customers included suchinfluential entities as his financial backers, Drexel, Morgan & Co., the ParkBank, and The New York Times. (The New York Herald had an isolated stand-aloneplant.)Understandably, Edison gloried in his amazing accomplishment of creating thefirst true incandescent electric light network. To a Sun reporter, he said thatday, “I have accomplished all I promised.” And he had indeed brought theincandescent electric light to New York City. But from the start, Edison hadseen New York City as just the beginning. Already he had his corporate generalsreadying for new conquests. Before him the great inventor saw only more gloryand great fortune, which to Edison translated into utter freedom to exercise hisprodigious gifts as an inventor. He explained, “My one ambition is to be able towork without regard to the expense…. I want none of the rich man’s usual toys. Iwant no horses or yachts—I have no time for them. What I want is a perfectworkshop.” While only the most perspicacious yet understood the potential ofelectricity, far-seeing capitalists were already envisioning the day the clearlysuperior electric light would displace the vast and lucrative natural gasindustry, worth $400 million just in the United States. Edison’s electric lightwould span the world, and he and his backers would be even more famous and veryrich. Pearl Street was just the tiny beginning of a great and lucrative radiantempire."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_060_r1.jpg]Nikola Tesla, “our Parisian”CHAPTER 4Nikola Tesla: “Our Parisian”In April of 1882, a tall, slender young Serbian engineer of twenty-six namedNikola Tesla descended from a train amid the vast, sooty clangor of the Gare del’Est and emerged into the resplendence of belle epoque Paris. The dreamy andromantic Tesla was enchanted by the magnificent grandeur oflate-nineteenth-century Paris. For days after he arrived, he just wandered. Hestrolled the broad, expansive boulevards created by Baron Haussmann, lined withfashionable cafés and shaded with fragrant flowering chestnut trees; he admiredthe formal city parks with their splashing fountains and geometric designs ofclipped greenery, he peered into the ancient and lovely churches set back in thewarrens of old neighborhoods, lively with street markets pungent with every fishand cheese imaginable. Tesla lingered by the silvery Seine, spanned by onesculptured bridge after another.Paris at night, he found, was perhaps more wondrous. Kilometer after kilometerof gaslit avenues glowed in the darkness, lined by luminous shop windows anddepartment stores. After dark, animated crowds swirled about like moths in theircommercial penumbrae. The Paris Opera in those soft spring evenings was a gildedchimera, its new electric lighting casting a moneyed sheen on the ladies’diamonds and the gentlemen’s silk top hats and opera cloaks. The city’straditional gaslight, now joined by the new arc lights and the fledglingincandescence, combined to produce a distinctly modern metropolis, one ofhaunting nocturnal moods. Mirrored Parisian cafés and theaters, lit upluxuriantly, came to scintillating life, wonderfully alluring and atmospheric.“I can never forget the deep impression that magic city produced on my mind,”Tesla said decades later.1 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts1a] ButNikola Tesla had come to the legendary City of Light not to gawk like a countryrube, but to work as a junior engineer in Ivry-sur-Seine at Thomas Edison’sSociété Industrielle, headed by Charles Batchelor, veteran of Menlo Park andengineer to the newly established Compagnie Continentale Edison.Those first few days of bedazzlement over Parisian glamour soon gave way to aregimen and rhythm of hard work. For Nikola Tesla the junior engineer, howeverdreamy and eccentric he might be, was truly possessed by only one greatpassion—the mystery of all things electric. So he rented rooms on the edge ofthe ancient and picturesque Latin Quarter with its many students and professorsand settled into a strenuous schedule that began at 5:00 A.M. “Every morningregardless of the weather,” Tesla explained, “I would go from the Boulevard St.Marcel, where I resided, to a bathing house on the Seine; plunge into the water,loop the circuit [swim laps] twenty-seven times and then walk an hour to reachIvry, where the Company’s factory was located. There I would have a woodchopper’s breakfast at half past seven o’clock and then eagerly await the lunchhour, in the meantime cracking hard nuts for the Manager of the Works, Mr.Charles Batchelor, who was an intimate friend and assistant of Edison.”2[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts2a]It was a considerable coup for a young man whose whole soul resonated to thelittle-known mysteries of electricity: He was here in the expanding Edisonempire, for Thomas Edison was the great practical man in the field, the one whohad shown the highly skeptical scientists you could indeed subdivide theelectric light and take it indoors. And Tesla’s boss, Batchelor, had beenpresent at the creation of the very incandescent light bulb that was launching anew luminous epoch. Charles Batchelor, after his years in Newark and then MenloPark, knew very well what hard work was, and he had arrived in Paris determinedto conquer and electrify all of Europe, starting from scratch. Yet this was amonumental ambition, and at times, even the usually genial Batchelor felt deeplyburdened, as this irascible note to Edison shows: “My job here is no fool of ajob, what with lamps, dynamos, chandeliers, and all the extras. I am just in upto my neck; then I have so much outside work of such a responsible nature andinvolving so much money that I wear a hat about three sizes larger than when Ileft New York.”3 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts3a]Young Tesla, in contrast, was but a novice, a very junior engineer at theSociété Industrielle. But he was also one who quickly showed he was a reliabletroubleshooter capable of solving most electrical tangles. Tesla spoke good,formal, heavily accented English and was also fluent in numerous otherlanguages, notably French and German. But observant colleagues concluded thathowever talented Tesla was as an engineer, he was also a decidedly odd fellow.Always fastidious in appearance, his black hair waving back gently, his mustacheneatly trimmed, the tall, slender Tesla was prey to strange habits and phobias.He (silently) counted each step he took as he made his early morning walk downto the Ivry factory. Every activity ideally had to be divisible by three (hencethe twenty-seven laps each morning in the Seine). Before eating or drinkinganything, he felt obliged to calculate its cubic contents. He deeply dislikedshaking hands with anyone. He had a “violent aversion against the earrings ofwomen,” pearls above all. “I would not touch the hair of other people except,perhaps, at the point of a revolver.” The mere sight of a peach brought on afever.4 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts4a] Moreover, Tesla could(and happily did) recite long swaths of Serbian poetry from heart.Tesla’s very presence in the noisy, busy Ivry Edison factory showed the deepincursions already made by the new modern industrial order on long-heldtraditions and life patterns. All the men in his deeply conservative Serbianfamily had always been destined for the church or the army, honored professionsin their strategic small world ill situated between the decaying Ottoman empireand the crumbling European monarchies. “I was,” Tesla conceded readily,“intended from my very birth for the clerical profession and this thoughtconstantly oppressed me.”5 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts5a] Hiseminent father was an Eastern Orthodox minister. His highly inventive mother haddevised and fashioned many handy household items and tools. She was also amaster weaver who spun much of her own thread. “When she was past sixty,” wroteTesla, “her fingers were still nimble enough to tie three knots in an eyelash.”6[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts6a] But Tesla seemed destined onlyfor electricity. All his life he recalled this formative episode at age threewith his beloved cat, Macak. “It was dusk of the evening and I felt impelled tostroke Macak’s back. Macak’s back was a sheet of light and my hand produced ashower of sparks loud enough to be heard all over the place.” What was this? theyoung boy wondered to his father. “‘Well,’ [his father] finally remarked, ‘thisis nothing but electricity, the same thing you see on the trees in a storm.’ Mymother seemed alarmed. ‘Stop playing with the cat,’ she said, ‘he might start afire.’ I was thinking abstractedly. Is nature a giant cat? If so, who strokesits back? It can only be God, I concluded…. Day after day I asked myself what iselectricity and found no answer.”7[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts7a]During high school, Tesla, a prodigy in math and physics, fell even more deeplyand irrevocably in thrall to the still nascent science of electricity. Healarmed his professors with his voracious and exhausting appetite for work,especially if it had to do with electricity. “It is impossible for me to conveyan adequate idea of the intensity of feeling I experienced in witnessing [myphysics teacher’s] exhibitions of these mysterious phenomena. Every impressionproduced a thousand echoes in my mind. I wanted to know more of this wonderfulforce; I longed for experiment and investigation.”8[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts8a] But hovering always was theimpending burden of the family priesthood. When the adolescent Tesla wasstricken with cholera and teetered on the brink of death, his anxious fatheragreed that he could study to become an electrical engineer. So Tesla, the onlyson, recovered and was free to begin his studies in Graz, Austria.In 1877, during his second year at Graz, Tesla walked into his favorite physicsclass and saw sitting upon the wooden table a fascinating-looking machine, anassemblage of magnet and metal. Just in from the fabled city of Paris, itfeatured a large, standing, horseshoe-shaped laminated field magnet that stoodover and around a hollow cylinder encased in tightly wrapped wire—the armature.This was the new dynamo invented by Belgian Zénobe-Théophile Gramme. It wascausing a great stir in Western Europe and the United States because here, atlast, was a dynamo that could generate enough electricity—when powered by asteam engine—to run the new sun-bright arc lights in factories and on citystreets. But equally thrilling, the Gramme machine, when run in reverse, couldalso serve as a motor. If machines, too, could be moved by electricity, theimplications of this new motive power would be enormous.Raptly watching his teacher’s demonstration of this Gramme machine with itsmagical combination of two long known materials—magnet and metal—Tesla couldlittle dream how this clever machine would change his whole life trajectory.When the Gramme machine was run as a motor, its commutator brushes (segments ofcopper that rotated with the armature and caused the current to flow in onedirection only), noticed Tesla, were “sparking badly, and I observed that itmight be possible to operate a motor without these appliances. But [myprofessor] declared it could not be done and did me the honour of delivering alecture on the subject, at the conclusion he remarked, ‘Mr. Tesla may accomplishgreat things, but he certainly will never do this. It would be equivalent toconverting a steadily pulling force, like that of gravity, into a rotary effort.It is a perpetual motion scheme, an impossible idea.’”9[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts9a]Initially deeply embarrassed by such a public rebuke, Tesla the dreamer couldnot resist, however, thinking about the pointlessness of the sparkingcommutators. And indeed, these were the glaring weak points of the first newexperimental electric motors. The gauze brushes that rubbed against thecommutators were essential for picking up the naturally alternating electriccurrent and sending it back into the motor as a nice, tame direct current. Atthe same time, commutators were also expensive to maintain for obviousreasons—whenever the motor ran, the commutator brushes were wearing down andgenerating sparks. So young Tesla was soon immersed almost daily in anelectrical reverie, his blue gray eyes ablaze, his mind cogitating variousdesigns of motors that did not involve sparking brushes, reviewing again andagain how he might combine motors and generators. “The images I saw were to mereal and perfectly tangible.”In the fall of 1880, as Thomas Edison was laboring away at Menlo Park to get hiscentral power network ready for his second New Year’s Eve demonstration, faracross the Atlantic, Nikola Tesla, who had managed to get himself kicked out ofhigh school for gambling and then done some youthful drifting, was entering theuniversity in the ancient city of Prague, Bohemia, at age twenty-four. He stayedin Prague but a year, for his father died, forcing Tesla, now twenty-five, toget a job. He moved to Budapest, Hungary, the thriving commercial capital of theAustro-Hungarian empire, where he worked for a new telephone company run by afamily friend, one Ferenc Puskas, brother of Thomas Edison’s European friend andrepresentative Theodore Puskas. Through all these intervening years, troubles,and various relocations, Tesla had never stopped wrestling in his head with howto design a motor that did not awkwardly scoop up electric current with acommutator and brush.At the phone company, Tesla’s intense and voracious work pace brought on anexcruciating breakdown. The glorious city of Budapest with its showplace parksalong the Danube River, famous castle, and lively cafés was reduced to tiny,tormenting sounds. “I could hear the ticking of a watch with three rooms betweenme and the timepiece. A fly alighting on a table in the room would cause a dullthud in my ear. A carriage passing at a distance of a few miles fairly shook mywhole body. The whistle of a locomotive twenty or thirty miles away made thebench or chair on which I sat, vibrate so strongly the pain was unbearable.”10[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts10a] The doctor was mystified andoffered no hope of recovery. Yet even as the world hurtled and smashed upon him,Tesla felt that all this hypersensitivity was slowly unleashing from hisunconscious the motor design that he had been seeking for almost five years.One of Tesla’s closest college friends, Anthony Szigety, had also moved toBudapest to work at the new telephone company. He suggested to the debilitatedNikola that he begin to exercise to regain his health. With exercise and freshair, Tesla began to recover. One chilly February late afternoon in 1882, theathletic Szigety persuaded Tesla to wander forth to a city park as the sun wassetting lushly. Tesla, as was his dreamy wont, began reciting poetry, Goethe’sFaust, to celebrate the blazing sky before them:The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil,Upon its track to follow, follow soaring . . .“As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash of lightning andin an instant the truth was revealed.” Tesla had been swaying and waving hisarms gracefully as he declaimed, as if he were about to soar aloft. Now, tall,emaciated from his illness, he stood stock still. Szigety was worried that hisfriend had been stricken again and tried to steer him to a bench. Instead, Teslaswooped down and snatched a big twig. “I drew with a stick in the sand…. Theimages I saw were wonderfully sharp and clear and had the solidity of metal andstone, so much that I told him, ‘See my motor here; watch me reverse it.’ Icannot begin to describe my emotions.”11[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts11a] Decades later, Teslapassionately relived this exultant electrical epiphany with his firstbiographer, science editor John J. O’Neill, recalling how he, Tesla, rapturouslygestured to his simple designs in the dirt and declared to Szigety, “Isn’t itbeautiful? Isn’t it sublime? Isn’t it simple? I have solved the problem. Now Ican die happy. But I must live, I must return to work and build the motor so Ican give it to the world. No more will men be slaves to hard tasks. My motorwill set them free, it will do the work of the world.”12[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts12a]While Tesla came of an educated clan, he had grown up among farmers and laborersand knew well the relentless, bone-wearying drudgery that always had been (andstill was) the daily lot of most of humanity. If a field had to be plowed, orsown, or harvested, people would do each backbreaking step, helped perhaps bytheir animals. If a well had to be dug, men with shovels would dig it, meter bymeter. If a stout tree had to be felled, men would saw arduously back and forthuntil finally it toppled. If water had to be fetched and carried, women orchildren would haul it in heavy, sloshing bucketfuls. If clothes had to bewashed, that dirty laundry would all be scrubbed by hand.The steam engine had already wrought a great revolution in transportation andmanufacturing. Steam engines were powering new factories, allowing textile millsto spin out cloth in great undulating waves, and railroads spanned wholecontinents, reducing perilous journeys of many months to mere days. Now, Teslasaw his AC induction motor similarly obliterating life’s tiresome daily choresand burdens in a thousand ways.Szigety was also an electrical engineer, and he gradually grasped that Teslahad—astonishingly—figured out the motor he had been obsessing over for almostfive years. Tesla had at long last extricated his tormenting electrical visionsand given them substance. He had dispensed with the awkward commutators andbrushes to produce power from an almost magical rotating magnetic field. Therein the Budapest park, Nikola Tesla had finally figured out how to design a motorthat operated on the undulating electrical rhythms of alter-nating current. Theswift back-and-forth reversals of AC as they advanced along their conductors(versus the steady, forward-only advance of DC electrons) would prove to becompletely pivotal in the ultimate development of Tesla’s polyphase vision, butin Budapest, Tesla knew only that he’d figured out his AC motor. Tesla andSzigety stayed up all night rejoicing in Tesla’s brilliant and completelyoriginal new motor design. Tesla’s first biographer, the science editor of theNew York Herald Tribune, explained Tesla’s advance thus: “Up to this timeeveryone who tried to make an alternating current motor used a single circuit….What Tesla did was to use two circuits, each one carrying the same frequency ofalternating current, but in which the current waves were out of step with eachother. This was the equivalent of adding to an engine a second cylinder…. [Thesecurrents created] a rotating magnetic field … [that] possessed the property oftransferring wirelessly through space, by means of its lines of force, energy.”In short, Tesla planned to so position his currents that as the first waned, thenext would kick in, creating an invisible whirling magnetic field, a beautifullysimple AC induction motor, what some would later call a “wheel of electricity,”with almost no wearing parts. However, all this was still firmly in Tesla’shead—down to the most minute details, for he never worked from blueprints, onlyhis own prodigious, three-dimensional memory. Of course, no one but Szigety andTesla knew of his great breakthrough. Nor, as Tesla would soon find out, wouldmany people—even fellow electricians—in the early 1880s be able to appreciatethe brilliance and originality of his motor. Why, they would wonder, shouldanyone care much about an AC induction motor that ran off an AC generator—justas arc lights did—when geniuses like Edison were conquering the world withcentral stations generating DC? And Edison had motors aplenty to offer customerswho wanted them to power their factories. Tesla was about to discover the perilsand frustrations of being ahead of his time.For the next few weeks, the always dreamy Tesla drifted into an ec-staticreverie. “For a while I gave myself up entirely to the intense enjoyment ofpicturing machines and devising new forms…. The pieces of apparatus I conceivedwere to me absolutely real and tangible in every detail…. In less than twomonths I evolved virtually all the types of motors and modifications of thesystem.”13 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts13a] About this time,Ferenc Puskas, the family friend and patron, sold the telephone business whereTesla had been working and returned to Paris. Tesla, his brain afire withwhirling electric motors, soon followed. For the other Puskas brother, Tivadaror Theodore, Thomas Edison’s European promoter and business partner, had agreedto introduce Nikola Tesla to Charles Batchelor, Edison’s right-hand man and themain force behind European Edison. Theodore Puskas had ably represented Edison’stelephone and phonograph patents in Europe, and Edison had kept him informedfrom the start about the glorious prospects of the incandescent light and thecentral station system.So it was that in 1884 Nikola Tesla arose each morning in Paris, swam histwenty-seven laps in the pool, and then strode down (presumably counting everystep) to Ivry-sur-Seine, where Batchelor had established a large factory toproduce dynamos and the other elements needed to install isolated stand-aloneplants or central stations. Young engineers like Tesla learned all theintricacies of the various Edison machines and distribution systems, preparatoryto fanning out across Europe to bring incandescence and electrical power to theOld World. The ever reliable Batchelor had been entrusted with a formidablefirst task upon reaching Paris: to work with Puskas to install and promote theEdison lighting exhibit in all its technical glory at the Paris ElectricalExposition of 1881. To the amazement of the cosmopolitan crowds of visitorsattending the vast exhibit hall dominated by a working lighthouse, Edison’sgigantic and powerful new jumbo generators lit up an astonishing five hundredincandescent lamps of 16 candlepower each.Even the most cosmopolitan were puzzled by electricity. Unlike a steam engine,its power was obscure, invisible. Wrote one Frenchman, “We are not yet in thehabit of observing machines that function without apparent cause. Their occultworkings baffle us. The secret of their existence escapes us.”14[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts14a] Edison’s electrical triumph wassuch that he swept all the top honors for his dazzling luminous display, leavinghis competitors like the Englishmen Joseph Swan and Lane Fox, and fellowAmerican Hiram Maxim, sharing a paltry second place. To Edison, struggling backin New York to get his central station working, this had been a soothing balm.Perhaps sweeter yet was the complete and public capitulation of Englishscientist William Preece. The longtime Edison critic had scoffed time and againat Edison’s assertion that he had subdivided the light. After visiting the Parisexhibit, Preece wrote, “Mr. Edison’s system has been worked out in detail, witha thoroughness and mastery of the subject that can extract nothing but eulogyfrom his bitterest opponents. Many unkind things have been said of Mr. Edisonand his promises; perhaps no one has been severer in this direction than myself.It is some gratification for me to be able to announce my belief that he has atlast solved the problem he set himself to solve.”15[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts15a] As if that were not triumphenough, the French conferred the Légion d’Honneur on Edison—which, along withall the other accolades, imbued his new Paris company with great prestige andcredibility.At the Edison factory in Ivry, Tesla had met his first Americans, who “fairlyfell in love with me because of my proficiency in Billiards!” Of course, thenaive and enthusiastic Tesla was soon explaining his wonderful alternatingcurrent induction motor and full system to these new colleagues and bosses,assuming that they, of all people, would appreciate it. At a time when theunderstanding of electricity was still quite primitive, polyphase alternatingcurrent was a quantum leap and difficult to grasp. Tesla’s exuberant andidealistic plan to liberate the world from drudgery was not at all obvious evento those working at Ivry. What they knew and understood was direct currentelectricity, where the electrons flowed only in one direction and created littlemagnetic field. There was no way to increase the voltage (or driving pressure)of that electricity. Really, the only way to increase the amount of directcurrent flowing out into an Edison power grid was to provide heavier (and highlyexpensive) copper wires to carry those greater numbers of electrons to theirultimate destination. The greater the current, the greater the heat on thewires. Hence the need for sturdy, low-resistance copper. Moreover, as thoseheavy currents traveled over the wires, they lost some of their energy toexpended heat. Since the amount of delivered electric power is a function ofvoltage (or pressure) times current (flowing electrons), direct currentelectricity systems—with their low voltages—needed to be high-current systems.It was this immutable Ohm’s law of electricity and the high cost of copper thatkept the Edison systems confined to small, high-density locales. It also meantthat no matter where you might come in accidental contact with an Edison DCsystem, you could not get badly shocked. The overall power was just too low.One of the Paris Edison men, D. Cunningham, foreman of the mechanicaldepartment, proposed to the young and hardworking Serbian that they form acompany and finance it by selling stock to develop Tesla’s fabulous invention.“The proposal,” Tesla would later write, “seemed to me comical in the extreme. Idid not have the faintest conception of what he meant, except that it was anAmerican way of doing things. Nothing came of it, however, and during the nextfew months I had to travel from one place to another in France and Germany tocure the ills of the power plants.”16[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts16a] That fall, as the EdisonElectric Light Company in New York was officially launching its Pearl StreetStation power network, Tesla again returned to Paris. After spending some monthsworking closely with the Edison machines, he now proposed to his Paris bossessome improvements in the standard dynamos. “My success was complete and thedelighted directors accorded me the privilege of developing automatic regulatorswhich were much desired.”17 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts17a]image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_010_r1.jpg]Although Tesla freely shared his vision of a new and wondrous AC inductionmotor, none of the harried Edison managers seemed interested. Theirs was a DCsystem. They had good motors to offer their customers. What possible need didthey have for an AC system or an AC motor? They had many other matters on theirminds. Establishing the European Edison companies was fraught with thepredictable difficulties of creating any new enterprise, but it was exacerbatedby the scope and ambition of the company, the sheer newness of the product, andthe technical and managerial inexperience of virtually all involved. As anotherelectrical manager of the time explained, “People generally did not at allappreciate the need or value of electricity. They had to be educated to itsuse…. Suitable manufacturing methods as well as adequate ways of distributingthe manufactured product had to be devised…. Customers did not exist, they hadto be created.”18 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts18a] Despite thegreat triumph of the Paris Expo, Parisians showed little serious interest in acentral station. Batchelor’s almost daily letters and cables back to New Yorkare a litany of insufficient capital, shipments that needed to be speeded up,fickle clients of isolated plants, problematic and erratic machines, andpoor-quality supplies. Many of these difficulties were resolved fairly easily,but others were major embarrassments that threatened grave financialconsequences. Into the latter category fell the disastrous case of the Edisonlighting plant at the new railroad station in the important commercial city ofStrasbourg, in Alsace-Lorraine, a region held by Germany since the war of 1870.In early 1883, the Strasbourg city fathers held a dedication ceremony toshowcase the new railroad station’s light, an important event graced by theaugust presence of the aged but powerful Emperor William I of Germany. When theswitch was turned on to light the station’s 1,200 Edison bulbs and flood thegrand space with incandescent radiance, there was instead a terrifying explosionthat blew out a wall. The German government, which had placed the order, wasoutraged at this violent fiasco and refused to accept the plant, much less payfor it. “On account of my knowledge of the German language and past experience,”wrote Tesla, “I was entrusted with the difficult task of straightening outmatters and early in 1883, I went to Strasbourg on that mission…. The practicalwork, correspondence, and conferences with officials kept me preoccupied day andnight.”19 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts19a] By summer, therailroad station plant was largely repaired and negotiations launched with theGerman bureaucracy for payment. Tesla now had the time to do what he had beenchafing to do—create a prototype of his AC induction motor. Having grasped thefundamental advantage of AC over DC, Tesla had long since designed in his head asystem that would put it to work. “As soon as I was able to manage, I undertookconstruction of a simple motor in a mechanical shop opposite the railroadstation, having brought with me from Paris some material for that purpose….[That summer] I finally had the satisfaction of seeing the rotation affected byalternating currents of different phase, and without sliding contacts orcommutator, as I had conceived a year before. It was an exquisite pleasure butnot to compare with the delirium of joy following the first revelation.”20[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts20a]Having been further exposed to the American notions of stock companies andworking capital, Tesla tried through some of his new and influential friends inStrasbourg, including the former mayor, to persuade a number of local wealthymen to invest in his revolutionary electric generator. To his mortification, noone evinced the smallest iota of interest, despite his being able to demonstratehis working prototype. Certainly there was a place for electricity in trainstations, factories, and the homes of the adventurous rich, but if theworld-famous, much honored American Edison was already installing electricityall over the Continent, why would anyone need the untested ideas of an obscurepoetry-reciting junior engineer from Croatia? Who would risk their money on suchan unknown? Having failed to sway any Strasbourg capitalists, Tesla was anxiousto return to the cosmopolitan wealth of Paris and try his prospects there, nowthat he had his working model. But the Germans’ punctilious observation of everyrule of rank and protocol held him hostage many months more in Strasbourg, asthe completion of the railroad job stretched on and on through the fall andwinter of 1883 and into the New Year. It was not until the spring of 1884 thatthe Germans finally accepted and paid for the Strasbourg Hoffbahn plant.Nikola Tesla then returned to Paris (after a year away), just as the Paris Salonwas opening at the Palais de l’Industrie. For several years, the great hall fullof paintings had been lighted with arc lights at night, a decision that hadoutraged some artists but had quadrupled the number of strolling art lovers (orthe merely inquisitive) to seven hundred thousand, for many more had eveningsfree for such diversions than had days. In such small ways were the socialfruits of electricity already apparent. So Tesla reveled in the beauties andenergy of Paris as he strode down to Ivry-sur-Seine, happily anticipating“liberal compensation” for his dynamo improvements and his successful resolutionof the Strasbourg assignment. With a thick wad of bonus francs, he could finallyfinance a full working model of his AC system, including his beloved motor andthe necessary polyphase AC generator to run it properly. Then he would attractsome venturesome French capitalists. Instead, the slightly older and wiser Teslafound his Edison bosses all passing the buck as he sought his bonus. “It dawnedon me that my reward was a castle in Spain,” a mirage.21[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts21a]Considering the Edison companies’ constant scrounging for more capital and therather perilous and very nascent state of their American and Europeanoperations, it is little wonder that no manager felt inclined to dole out cashrewards. In its 1883 annual report, the Edison Electric Light Company hadreported only losses. Moreover, there is no indication in the vast Edisonarchive of business correspondence that Tesla’s Paris bosses valued Tesla’scontributions as highly as did the young man himself. Seeing that Tesla wasrestless and ambitious, Edison officials urged him instead to go to New York andwork with the master himself. Charles Batchelor had already sailed home, havingoverseen the installation of more than a hundred isolated plants all overEurope, in textile mills, factories, hotels, theaters, stores, steamships,shipyards, and railroad stations. But only three central stations had been soldand installed, in the cities of Milan, Rotterdam, and St. Petersburg.Tesla’s young life thus far was marked by a series of dramatic events—severalyouthful near misses with death, his passionate embrace of electricity as alife’s work, and the revelation of the induction motor and the AC polyphasesystem. He was especially prone in these Paris years to certain intensehallucinations, notably encompassing flashes of light. “They were my strangestand [most] inexplicable experience,” Tesla would later say. “They usuallyoccurred when I found myself in a dangerous or a distressing situation or when Iwas greatly exhilarated. In some instances I have seen the air around me filledwith tongues of living flame. Their intensity, instead of diminishing, increasedwith time and seemingly attained a maximum when I was about twenty-five yearsold.”22 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts22a] (Tesla also liked todescribe his birth as occurring at the stroke of midnight during a severeelectrical storm, obvious portents of his electrical future.) Nikola Tesla’sdeparture from Europe and arrival in the New World (what he termed the “Land ofthe Golden Promise”) featured further dramas. When he arrived at the Parisrailroad station, “I discovered my money and tickets were gone,” not to mentionhis valise. With the train pulling out in great billows of steam, the franticTesla decided to go anyway and ran down the platform and scrambled on. Thesteamship company allowed him to board at the last minute only when no one elsearrived to claim his berth. “I managed to embark for New York with the remnantsof my belongings, some poems and articles I had written, and a package ofcalculations relating to solutions of an unsolvable integral and my flyingmachine. During the voyage I sat most of the time at the stern of the shipwatching for an opportunity to save somebody from a watery grave.”23[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts23a]Nikola Tesla debarked at the port of New York on June 6, 1884, a fair, pleasantFriday, as did thousands of Germans, Irish, Scandinavians, Italians, and RussianJews, all, like the young electrician, full of American dreams—peasants yearningfor farms; young men heading to mines, mills, factories; husbands and fathershoping to amass quick savings to return home to buy land or a business; wivesand mothers envisioning happier, more prosperous futures for themselves andtheir offspring. There in the echoing spaces of Manhattan’s Castle Gardenimmigration depot, a gloomy former fort and onetime theater on a pile of rocksdown by the Battery, the multitude of nationalities mingled, their manylanguages a Tower of Babel as they shuffled through the immigration lines andinto an America fast becoming the most prosperous place on earth. For it was inthese years between the end of the Civil War and the turn of the century thatthe United States would become urban, industrial, and exceedingly rich, itsgross national product soaring from $9.1 billion to $37.1 billion, its percapita income tripling. And the three compelling reasons for this risingprosperity were there on view at Castle Garden. The first element was swiftpopulation growth. More than seven million hopeful souls passed through CastleGarden alone between 1855 and 1890, when Ellis Island opened as the newfederally run immigration depot for New York. These foreign immigrants surged bythe thousands off steamships and quickly set out via America’s far-reachingrailroads, seeking their destiny in the great booming cities, remoteterritories, and new states. And there lay the second reason for burgeoningAmerican wealth—its excellent system of transportation and communication. Thefast-expanding American railroad network knit together its vast and disparatespaces, making commerce easily possible, as did the indispensable telegraph andthe new telephone.The people and the transport in turn made possible efficient exploitation of thenation’s phenomenal natural blessings—its vast coal and ore deposits, its richfarmlands and forests. Great fortunes and great enterprises were coalescing asthis new American world of industry and cities arose. Men like William H.Vanderbilt were now richer than the queen of England. Millions were similarlystriving to become rich—in railroads, steel, oil, lumber, coal, gold, silver,sugar, department stores, or such new consumer products as cigarettes,ready-made clothes, soap, biscuits, and colas. But in all those daily arrivalsin that early summer of 1884, it is hard to imagine any immigrant whose dreamsand visions equaled those of the obscure and impecunious Serb Nikola Tesla, whostepped onto the pedestrian precincts of crowded, dirty lower Manhattan stillswathed in reveries about bringing cheap and abundant power and light to thewhole world.So Tesla set forth confidently in the New World, with all of four cents in thepocket of his one suit, the address of a friend, and the prospect of a job withEdison. New York City of the mid-1880s was not Paris. The Battery offered abroad green turf, wide paths, and shady trees. But as soon as one walked northfrom there, one was hit by the city’s frenetic commercial pace and palpableatmosphere of moneymaking and money getting. There were no sweeping boulevards,grandiose palaces, or formal public gardens. The downtown districts were ahodgepodge of large warehouses, commercial establishments, and shabby tenements,bisected by the four north-south lines of the elevated trains, whose noisy steamengines rained down soot and ash on the unwary from on high. Once summer settledin, the streets were hot and dusty and stank of horses, for equine teams pulledvehicles of every sort, the huge colorful old-style city omnibuses, the newstreetcars gliding more quickly on sunken rail tracks, all manner of bigteamster carts, and, for those who could afford it, the personal carriages. Theimmediate crowded blocks around Wall Street were fine and very imposing, builtup with noble and costly ten-story edifices. Newsboys everywhere hawked thecity’s bestselling newspapers, the Sun and the Herald, and the new fast-risingfavorite, the World. And jutting up high over the warm and smelly commercialstreets towered a veritable forest of wooden poles and their tangle ofelectrical wires, drooping and draping from pole to rooftop to window and on toother poles. In some commercial blocks, the festoons of hundreds ofcrisscrossing wires almost obscured the early-summer sky.Nikola Tesla was walking north and taking in all these jangling sights andsounds when he noticed a foreman in a shop standing over an electrical motor andlooking most exasperated. When Tesla entered the doorway, the man explained themachine was broken. Tesla offered his services, eventually got the motorworking, and was promptly offered a job. He declined, saying he already hadprospects of one. The grateful shop owner paid him $20, a munificent sum when aworker’s daily wage was generally $1. A skilled, educated, and experiencedengineer like Tesla made $18 a week. So Tesla had his first taste of the richesof the New World. He continued on, located his friend, and secured a night’srest. The next day he headed toward Fifth Avenue, where, one guide said, were“concentrated the wealth and aristocracy of the city … all the [brownstone]blocks are massive and palatial … [consisting of] the huge club-houses, theexpensive libraries, the fine picture galleries, and richly furnished drawingrooms of this region of merchant-princes.”24[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts24a] There, each late afternoon, onecould marvel further at the conspicuous display of wealth, in this instance thepassing parade of some of the world’s finest horseflesh and most luxuriousvehicles en route to and from Central Park. There, fashionable New Yorkers likedto show off their fine equipages (and themselves) as they made their way amidthe park’s artfully placed carriage paths.Nikola Tesla fit in well with the well-dressed, attractive throngs on FifthAvenue. His education and his year in Paris had given him a certain polish, sohe confidently entered Edison headquarters at 65 Fifth Avenue. The impressivebrownstone was luxuriously fitted out with beautiful electrical chandeliers andlamps to entice the rich, while its topmost floor had been given over to housingfor some of the unmarried employees. On yet another floor, Edward Johnson hadstarted a night school for fledgling electricians, for the company desperatelyneeded trained men. Edison, wearing his shabby Prince Albert coat, was often tobe found squiring around the more exalted visitors or holding court in hiscomfortable back office, smoking ci-gars. “The meeting with Edison was amemorable event in my life,” Tesla later wrote. “I was amazed at this wonderfulman who, without early advantages and scientific training, had accomplished somuch. I had studied a dozen languages, delved in literature and art, and hadspent my best years in libraries reading all sorts of stuff that fell into myhands, from Newton’s ‘Principia’ to the novels of Paul de Kock, and felt thatmost of my life had been squandered. But it did not take long before Irecognized that it was the best thing I could have done.”25[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts25a]Edison was not quite as unkempt in appearance now that he was a New Yorker, buthe remained utterly practical, plainspoken, world famous, a great kidder, and atage thirty-seven a seasoned veteran of the corporate rough-and-tumble on bothsides of the Atlantic. Before him he saw Tesla, erudite, unknown, tall, slender,formal in dress and manner, a dreamy young man a decade his junior who expressedhimself in a flowery, heavy-accented style and came across as an utter naïf. Hequickly nicknamed him “our Parisian.” Tesla recalled, “I was thrilled to themarrow by meeting Edison, who began my American education right then and there.I wanted to have my shoes shined, something I considered below my dignity.Edison said, ‘You will shine the shoes yourself and like it.’ He impressed metremendously. I shined my shoes and liked it.”26[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts26a]Tesla soon proved his worth, for the passenger steamship SS Oregon was stuck indock over on the East River, unable to depart on schedule because Edison’son-board lighting system had broken down. “The predicament was a serious one,”Tesla recalled, “and Edison was much annoyed. In the evening I took thenecessary instruments with me and went aboard the vessel, where I stayed for thenight. The dynamos were in bad condition, having several short circuits andbreaks, but with the assistance of the crew, I succeeded in putting them in goodshape. At five o’clock in the morning, when passing along Fifth Avenue on my wayto the shop, I met Edison with Batchelor and a few others, as they werereturning home to retire. ‘Here is our Parisian running around at night,’ hesaid. When I told him I was coming from the Oregon and had repaired bothmachines, he looked at me in silence and walked away without another word. Butwhen he had gone some distance I heard him remark, ‘Batchelor, this is a goodman.’”27 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts27a]In the summer of 1884, the Edison Electric Illuminating Company in New York wasstill expanding, adding new customers, and always looking to supply electricityreliably and more profitably. They were now lighting up such importantinstitutions as the New York Stock Exchange, the New York Commercial Advertiser,the New Haven Steamboat Company’s offices and large pier, Brown Brothers &Company on Wall Street, and the North British & Mercantile Insurance Company onWilliam Street. Both Pearl Street in Manhattan and Menlo Park in New Jerseyserved as demonstrations of central stations.But Edison’s direct current central station system, with its half-milelimitation in any direction, was proving a tough sell in less compact cities andtowns. After all, it was far harder to convince the hundreds of businessesnecessary to make the network of a central station profitable that they neededelectric light than it was a single wealthy homeowner like J. P. Morgan or asingle factory owner, who could more easily see the advantages. By the end of1884, only eighteen central stations were installed in the United States. Incontrast, isolated stand-alone lighting plants, which required only theenthusiasm of a factory owner or a hotelier, were a popular product. By the fallof that year, there were 378 such plants all over the country. Once again, as inParis, Tesla was working on improving dynamos and troubleshooting. But with eachpassing week, he was “more and more anxious about the [AC induction motor]invention and was making up my mind to place it before Edison.”Edison, who was thoroughly fed up with the listless management of the maincompany controlled by his Wall Street directors, was very much preoccupied thatfall and winter with winning back control and restructuring the Edison companiesto better push his central stations and generally advance their products. OnAugust 9, his much neglected wife, having been ill on and off for several years,died out at Menlo Park, leaving Edison with three children. Edison threw himselfeven harder into his work. But in some late night dinner or other encounter,apparently he and Tesla did discuss his young employee’s proposed system foralternating current. Tesla pointed out that a central station based onalternating current dynamos could liberate electricity from the one-mile shackleof Edison’s DC plants. And if his, Tesla’s, induction motor was developed, itcould fill the big, looming gap of an AC system that aspired to go beyondlighting. Moreover, his AC induction motor would surely be superior to thoseoperating on DC. Edison, said Tesla, responded “very bluntly that he was notinterested in alternating current; there was no future to it and anyone whodabbled in that field was wasting his time; and besides, it was a deadly currentwhereas direct current was safe.”28[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts28a]The arc light companies all operated their blazing lights with high-voltagealternating current, and certainly there had been unfortunate accidents whereelectrical workers had been severely shocked and even killed by inadvertentcontact with the AC apparatus. Edison denounced AC as far too dangerous fordomestic use, a stance seconded by such other leaders in the field as Glasgow’sSir William Thomson, a scientist whose giant reputation gave his opinions greatweight. Perhaps just as relevant, Edison or his company had not invented ordeveloped the alternating current generators used for powering arc lights.Edison took enormous and justifiable pride in having invented—although oftenwith the help of his subordinates—every aspect of his low-voltage electricalsystem. A person touching any part of Edison’s DC system—from the dynamo to thewires to the bulbs—would receive only a mild shock. He wanted nothing to do withAC.Nikola Tesla had arrived in the United States just in time for the livelyevery-four-years blood sport of presidential politics, American style.Corruption, which had sullied many aspects of local and national life, was thecentral issue. Senator James G. Blaine, the Republican candidate, was seen asdeeply in thrall to the unbeloved and bullying railroads, which blatantly boughtwhom and what they wanted. The Democratic candidate was reformist New Yorkgovernor (and former mayor of Buffalo) Grover Cleveland, known as “Grover theGood” for his fight against Tammany corruption. Democrats portrayed their man asa rare paragon of honesty in an age when dirty dealing in business and politicswas rife. Then on July 21 the Republican Buffalo Evening Telegraph broke thescandal that the unmarried Cleveland had fathered a bastard! Wired Cleveland tothe party, “Whatever you say, tell the truth.” The truth was that it might havebeen his child, so he had provided support. The Republicans now taunted theDemocrats with the gibe, “Ma! Ma! Where’s my pa?” while the Democrats tauntedback, “Gone to the White House, ha! ha! ha!” Also running was New Jersey lawyerBelva Lockwood of the Equal Rights ticket, even though no American woman couldvote.The race between the tall, fat, bland-looking Cleveland and the gray-whiskeredBlaine was neck and neck when Blaine, the candidate of the new industrialtitans, descended upon Manhattan at the end of October. New York, with itslegions of rich men and newspapers that were read nationwide, had become deeplyinfluential. In the afternoon, candidate Blaine met with important Protestantministers at the vast marbled elegance of the Fifth Avenue Hotel. One ministerdenounced the Democrats as “the party whose antecedents are rum, Romanism, andrebellion.” A tired Blaine did not demur. Perhaps he was thinking of thatevening’s festivities at Gotham’s most famous and delectably high-tonedrestaurant, Delmonico’s, renowned for its luscious lobster Newburg and the evershowy and scrumptious house dessert, baked Alaska. Even Edison, that man of thepeople, preferred Delmonico’s above all other restaurants. And on the night ofOctober 29, 180 of America’s richest and most prominent men were gathering thereto fete their Republican candidate, whose main campaign plank was excludingimports through high tariffs, thus leaving the vast and lucrative Americanmarket completely to his hosts’ industrial and consumer blandishments.Unfortunately for Blaine, the scrappy Joseph Pulitzer had the previous yearbought the fading New York World and was consciously refashioning it into themust-read paper of the new upwardly mobile workingman and -woman, people whowere becoming deeply concerned at the rise of a plutocracy that seemeddetermined to control everything through convoluted monopolies, money power, andvirtual ownership of amenable politicians. After taking over, Pulitzer assembledthe paper’s existing staff and announced, “Gentlemen, you realize that a changehas taken place in the World. Heretofore you have all been living in the parlorand taking baths every day. Now I wish you to understand that, in future, youare all walking down the Bowery.”29[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts29a] Pulitzer proceeded boldly,abandoning the prim, reserved one-column format that indicated a story’simportance only by multiple decks of subheads. Instead, he splashed big newsacross many columns with blaring headlines and huge illustrations.So, to the great indignation of the rich Republicans, the October 30 New YorkWorld devoted the entire front page to the Delmonico’s dinner, declaring in agiant banner headline: A ROYAL FEAST OF BEL-SHAZZAR BLAINE AND THE MONEY KINGS.The well-fed rich—recognizable caricatures of William H. Vanderbilt, AndrewCarnegie, Jay Gould, and so forth—were sipping Monopoly Soup and ladling LobbyPudding while ignoring a poor wraithlike couple begging for scraps. The Worldwas also careful to report on the “rum, Romanism, and rebellion” remark, whichoutraged Irish Catholics, many of whom had previously been Blaine supporters.Blaine lost in New York State by only 1,149 votes and thereby forfeited thewhole election. New York City was not only the nation’s financial center, italso wielded enormous political power as the nation grappled with its newindustrial identity. Grover Cleveland became the first Democrat elected sincethe Civil War, and his ascension was a sign of a nation restive over risingplutocracy.Through all this no-holds-barred political combat over the nation’s future,Nikola Tesla labored diligently away at his electrical duties for Thomas Edison.“During this period I designed twenty-four different types of standard machineswith short cores and uniform pattern, which replaced the old ones. The Managerhad promised me fifty thousand dollars on the completion of this task.” In thespring of 1885, Tesla sought this big bonus. He told his first biographer, JohnJ. O’Neill, that Edison reneged, explaining that the offer had been a big joke.“Tesla,” said Edison, “you don’t understand our American humor.”30[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts30a] It is exceedingly hard toimagine that the Edison companies, still being in dire need of cash and capitalthemselves, would promise that kind of huge money—as much as they had gotten inhard cash to launch the initial company—to a salaried employee. Moreover,Tesla’s most recent biographer, Marc Seifer, points out that Tesla could noteven get a $7-a-week raise. When another employee approached Batchelor onTesla’s behalf (Tesla believing he deserved to have his salary raised from $18 aweek to $25), Batchelor curtly refused, saying, “The woods are full of men like[Tesla]. I can get any number of them I want for $18 a week.”31[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts31a] Whether a joke or a betrayal ofa promise, Tesla was sufficiently outraged to quit.Tesla had lasted less than a year as Edison’s employee in New York. In truth, heand Edison were like oil and water, each amused and annoyed by the other. Agreat dandy by nature, Tesla prided himself on being dapper and fashionable andabhorred Edison’s slovenly indifference: “If he had not later married a woman ofexceptional intelligence, who made it the one object of her life to preservehim, he would have died many years ago from consequences of sheer neglect.”32[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts32a] Far worse, believed Tesla, wasEdison’s approach to science: “If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack, hewould proceed at once with the diligence of the bee to examine straw after strawuntil he found the object of his search…. His method was inefficient in theextreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unlessblind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of suchdoings, knowing that a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90percent of his labor.”33 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts33a] Edison,in turn, dismissed Tesla as a “poet of science” whose ideas were “magnificentbut utterly impractical.”Tesla was catching on to the American way of operating, and now he took anabsolutely practical tack. He needed to make an independent name for himselfwith something very salable and useful if he was going to interest investors inhis far more visionary AC induction motor. So he set himself a straightforwardand mundane task—designing improved arc lights that did not flicker and a betterkind of generator to run them. In mid-March of 1885, Tesla began meeting withpatent attorney Lemuel Serrell and his patent artist, who instructed him onpreparing and submitting his first arc light patents. Serrell also introducedTesla to two Rahway, New Jersey, businessmen who eagerly backed the new TeslaElectric Light & Manufacturing Company. The company’s first project wasmunicipal arc lighting for Rahway, the investors’ hometown. For the next yearTesla labored away producing and installing his system, which lighted certainmajor streets along with a few factories. Tesla did all this to establish hisbona fides. The Electrical Review was sufficiently impressed with his advancesto feature his new system on its front page of August 16, 1886. In subsequentadvertisements in the same journal, the Tesla Electric Light & ManufacturingCompany an-nounced it was “now prepared to furnish the most perfect automatic,self-regulating system of electric arc lighting yet produced.” There was “noflickering or hissing of the lamps” under this “entirely new system of automaticregulation resulting in absolute safety and a great saving of power.”34[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts34a]In Rahway, New Jersey, over the next few months, the Tesla Electric Light &Manufacturing Company finished successfully installing the powerful moonlightwhite arc lights around the city. In the course of this inaugural businessventure, Tesla had received his first American patents—a commutator for a dynamoelectric machine on January 26, 1886, followed by an electric arc lamp onFebruary 9, 1886, and a regulator for a dynamo electric machine on March 2. Infall of 1886, Tesla proposed once again to his partners that they widen theirhorizons, think pioneering thoughts (rather than prosaic practical arc lightones), and get to work developing his world-changing alternating current motorand electrical system. “The delay of my cherished plans was agonizing,” Teslarecalled years later.35 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts35a] Not onlywere these shortsighted New Jersey gentlemen not interested, but they elected tocheat Tesla, ever the naïf when it came to business, out of his patents and ousthim from the very company he had founded. So in that autumn, poor Nikola Tesla,the romantic and dreamer, was reeling from “the hardest blow I ever received.Through some local influences, I was forced out of the company, losing not onlyall my interest but also my reputation as engineer and inventor.”36[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts36a] As he put it later, “I was free,but with no other possession than a beautifully engraved certificate of stock ofhypothetical value.”37 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts37a] Thiselegant, erudite electrician and immigrant suddenly found himself as pennilessas he had been when he’d stepped off the boat more than two years earlier.Moreover, he had no immediate prospects and was far too proud to seek help orwork from his former Edison colleagues.It is unlikely that Nikola Tesla harbored any illusions about the bleakdesperation of being down-and-out in Manhattan. The Edison Machine Works, whereTesla had worked, sat amid some of New York’s vilest slums, windowless warrenswhere summer heat baked in the stench of overflowing outdoor privies and wherebone-chilling winters drove the cold deep into the stained walls. Was it anywonder that disease and death awaited so many there, or that other familiarfate, the oblivion of vice and crime? In 1886, an arctic winter and a soureconomic spell had reduced more families than usual to beggary. Clashes betweenlabor and capital escalated venomously. Fast-swelling union ranks challenged theharsh new industrial order. Employers yielded as little as possible.Nonetheless, opined the censorious editors of the New-York Daily Tribune,“organized labor has astonished the country with exhibitions of its politicalpower,” starting with blockaded railroads, striking tanners, curriers, carpetweavers, coal miners, and the Chicago meat packers. In Manhattan, fifteenthousand striking streetcar drivers and conductors fought street battles withpolice and fill-ins until they extracted a twelve-hour day for a $2 wage. Allthrough 1886, “business in every quarter of the country has been disordered inconsequence of these and hundreds of similar uprisings.”38[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts38a] On May 4, anarchist bombthrowers killed seven policemen and injured dozens of strikers in Chicago’sHaymarket Square, sending shock waves of fear undulating through the wholenation. That violence curdled the better classes’ already lukewarm support forthe American labor movement.Into this harsh economic climate ventured an unemployed Nikola Tesla, who foundlittle need for his specialized electrical talents. “My high education invarious branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like amockery,” he would say later.39 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts39a]The newspapers were filled with hundreds of ads placed by men seeking work—ascoachmen, butlers, private waiters, valets, and that all-around position,“useful man,” one who could tend a furnace or assist in the stable. In contrast,the “Help Wanted” column might have a handful of prospects, a family at Park Rowlooking for someone to care for their horse, cow, and garden. Or there was theMadison Avenue household in need of a man to run the furnace, wash windows, andmake himself generally useful. With his money gone and his family far away,Tesla wandered the streets of Manhattan, the plush restaurants and luxuriousshops a mocking reminder of his gnawing penury. “There were many days when [I]did not know where my next meal was coming from. But I was never afraid to work,I went to where some men were digging a ditch … [and] said I wanted to work. Theboss looked at my good clothes and white hands and he laughed to the others …but he said, ‘All right. Spit on your hands. Get in the ditch.’ And I workedharder than anybody. At the end of the day I had $2.”40[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts40a]In this year of unrest and anarchism, the new electrical industry had its ownshare of woes, though working conditions were idyllic compared to the dark,fiery, and often fatal dangers of the coal mines and steel mills. ThomasEdison’s own businesses had so expanded that he no longer personally knew allhis men. At the lamp factory out in New Jersey, eighty highly skilled filamentsealers formed a union and “became very insolent,” said Edison, “knowing that itwas very impossible to manufacture lamps without them.” When they objected tothe proposed firing of one of their members, Edison quickly designed thirtymachines to automate their work. Then he fired the man as planned. “The unionwent out,” said Edison, following up with the punch line: “It has been out eversince.”41 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts41a]In March of 1886, a committee at the Edison Machine Works on Goerck Streetparlayed with their immediate boss, Charles Batchelor, demanding the right toform a union and seek better pay and conditions. The Edison management, whichpaid average wages, was amenable to reducing the workday from ten hours to nine,but they wanted no truck with unions. The shop was “to be run just as themanagers decided & no interference whatever to be tolerated.” Nor would theyaccept the end of piecework. Batchelor explained to reporters, “If [a worker]loafs or gets drunk he loses his own time, not ours.”42[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts42a] On May 19, the Edison workersstruck. Shortly thereafter, Thomas Edison moved the machine works upstate to thequiet town of Schenectady, an easy ride north and then west on the New YorkCentral Railroad. He wanted, he said, “to get away from the embarrassment of thestrikes and the communists to a place where our men are settled in their ownhomes.”43 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts43a]As for Nikola Tesla, “I lived through a year of terrible heartaches and bittertears, my sufferings being intensified by material want.”44[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts44a] Scraping by in the cold winter,Tesla was reduced many a day to working in a New York labor gang. Presumably, hewas painfully aware as he swung his pick or shoveled his dirt that others mightbe pressing ahead with AC systems. As the days began to warm, and the daylightbecame mellow and lingered longer, fate smiled again on this dreamer. In theearly spring of 1887, one of Tesla’s foremen realized that this hardworking Serbreally was no ordinary laborer. He arranged to introduce the down-on-his-luckelectrician to a high-level engineer at the Western Union Telegraph Company. Theengineer, Alfred S. Brown, was impressed by Tesla’s fervid description of his ACmotor that would power the world, and he in turn introduced Tesla to Charles F.Peck, a distinguished lawyer and investor. Peck was informed enough to know thatno one had yet managed to design a commercial industrial AC motor that actuallyworked. Why should he believe great deeds would come from this former juniorEdison engineer and failed arc light entrepreneur whose English was elegant butthickly accented? He declined even to watch some tests.Tesla racked his brain, wondering how to impress this bland attorney. “I had aninspiration,” he recalled many years later. He asked Peck, “Do you remember the‘Egg of Columbus’?” Tesla was referring to a banquet where the explorerchallenged all those skeptical of his quest to show how they would balance anegg on its end. After they tried in vain, Columbus took the egg and, crackingthe shell slightly by a gentle tap, made it stand upright. This small feat ledto an audience with Isabella, the queen of Spain, who pledged her support. Peckwas now intrigued. Was Tesla, he inquired, planning to balance an egg on itsend? And why? “Well, what if I could make an egg stand on the pointed endwithout cracking the shell?” Tesla saw he had his man’s interest. Peck said, “Ifyou could do this, we would admit you had gone Columbus one better.” Teslapressed him on whether this would make him a potential patron. “We have no crownjewels to pawn, but there are a few ducats in our buckskins,” Peck conceded.“And we might be able to help you to an extent.”45[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts45a]With that Tesla hurried forth through the tumult of the downtown streets cloggedwith wagons hauling barrels and every kind of freight to find a hard-boiled eggand a blacksmith. The demonstration took place the very next day. “A rotatingfield magnet was fastened under the top board of a wooden table and Mr. Teslaprovided a copper-plated egg and several brass balls and pivoted iron discs forconvincing his prospective associates. He placed the egg on the table and totheir astonishment it stood on end, but when they found it was rapidly spinningtheir stupefaction was complete. The brass balls and pivoted iron discs in turnwere sent spinning rapidly by the rotating field, to the amazement of thespectators. No sooner had they regained their composure than they delightedTesla with the question, ‘Do you need any money?’”46[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts46a]Nikola Tesla’s life was taking another one of its dramatic turns. After thebetrayal of his Rahway partners, his winter of pauperism and hard labor, NikolaTesla was once again launched on his long deferred electrical dream. Veryshortly, he, Peck, and the Western Union engineer Alfred S. Brown had formed theTesla Electric Company, and Tesla was happily setting up his first laboratory at89 Liberty Street, a busy thoroughfare a few blocks in from the jumbled wealthof the Hudson River wharves and ferry lines and north of the moneyed blocks ofWall Street. While the yells of the truckers driving huge teams to and from thedocks drifted in through his windows all that summer and fall, Tesla labored toput to paper the designs he needed to patent. Finally he would be able to buildthe whole AC system he had dreamed of for so long, especially his many inductionmotors. Finally he would free the world from drudge labor."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_062_r1.jpg]A young George WestinghouseCHAPTER 5George Westinghouse: “He Is Ubiquitous”The bold and dynamic Pittsburgh inventor and entrepreneur George Westinghousehad spent much of 1883 and 1884 living in New York, watching closely as Gothamgradually came alive electrically, a metropolis nightly more scintillating withartificial light. Now each wintry eve, when a lavender darkness enveloped thecity, the dazzling arc lamps bathed the major avenues in their brilliant bluelight. Broadway had become a new nighttime stage for stylish crowds ofpromenaders shopping and strolling, the new electric light gleaming off thecurved blackness of men’s derbies and high hats, casting a soft sheen on thewomen’s fur-trimmed velveteen cloaks, the jet black of their beads and featheredbonnets. Farther south, music halls and theaters sparkled brilliantly withelectric lights, while Edison’s incandescent light lit up newspaper offices onPark Row, the best hotels, and many of the financial edifices around WallStreet. All up Fifth Avenue and over on Madison the brownstone mansions of themerchant princes and the new industrialists were aglow each dusk with electriccandlepower. For those who cared to notice, the electrical future was quietlytaking shape.And George Westinghouse, one of the era’s industrial titans, was the sort whocared to notice. A forceful, well-built man of six feet, Westinghouse was animposing presence with his thick mane of chestnut hair, vigorous sideburns, andhuge walrus handlebar mustache. By 1884, at just thirty-seven, he had alreadyassembled a formidable empire and fortune in the free-wheeling world ofrailroads, the most important and ruthless corporate force in America. His firstrailroad-related inventions, a “car replacer” that got derailed trains quicklyback on the tracks and a long-lasting steel “frog” that prevented derailing atjunctions, met a sorry fate, licensed at first by railroads only to be quickly“improved” so the roads could claim their own patents. Then, in 1869,Westinghouse, all of twenty-two, introduced his most momentous invention todate, a revolutionary air brake that allowed the engineer of a passenger trainfor the first time to quickly and safely stop all the cars. Westinghouse had hada struggle finding anyone willing to back this novel and expensive venture. Andso, far, far wiser, when he finally did introduce his air brake, he staunchlyrefused to give the railroads licenses, saying only he would manufacture them inhis small Pittsburgh works.As the young Westinghouse improved his brakes and shored up his patents, therailroads tried to circumvent and eliminate this upstart. Wrote one railroadmanager to another, “Do you use Westinghouse and can you make any improvementupon his apparatus without his permission and cooperation?”1[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts1a] When Westinghouse felt therailroads, however powerful, were treading on his turf, he intervenedforcefully, threatening patent lawsuits, usually in person. “Westinghousestopped by,” passed along the railroad manager, “and warned that if we try thevacuum [brake], even experimentally, he will bring suit.”2[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts2a] Having seen his first patentsexpropriated by the railroads and his first company consequently dwindle away,Westinghouse assumed a lifelong ferocity when it came to his products andpatents.Just as Edison became familiar with electricity through telegraphy, Westinghouselearned about the “subtle agency” through its use in railroad signals. Havingswiftly established the Westinghouse Air Brake Company as preeminent in theUnited States, Westinghouse, who combined hard-driving ambition with a famouslywinsome, persuasive charm, set out to conquer England. He took with him his newwife, the refined and cultured Marguerite Erskine, whom he had met on a trainand soon married in her hometown of Brooklyn after a whirlwind courtship. InEngland, he eventually sold air brakes but also discovered railroad signaling.In 1881, he began buying up promising patents, most important one thatcontrolled electric circuits set off by trains, thereby activating signals. Bycombining these with his own improvements and inventions, Westinghouse soondominated this new field through yet another Westinghouse entity, the UnionSwitch and Signal Company, organized in 1882.The oil lamps used in the signaling system were problematic, and existingelectric companies were unhelpful with solutions. George’s brother Herman,another mechanically inclined businessman, “had become acquainted with a livewire, Mr. William Stanley, Jr. and through him the Electric Company began todevelop.”3 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts3a] The immediate problemwas the signal lamps, but they were something of an excuse. For if GeorgeWestinghouse was going into electricity, he would do it as he did everything, ina very big way. This suited William Stanley. Tall, slender, his middle-partedthin hair plastered neatly, and his luxuriant mustache ending in long, strangewisps, Stanley was indeed a “live wire.” After a dutiful semester at Yale, hebailed out to work with things mechanical, writing his parents, “Have had enoughof this, am going to New York.”4 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts4a]In 1884, after quick tours with the Swan Incandescent Electric Light Company andHiram Maxim and two successful sojourns in his own small-business ventures,Stanley agreed to come work for the formidable George Westinghouse, ready forbigger ventures.The truth was, when Westinghouse surveyed the state of the electrical art asembodied by Edison and his competitors, it did not much excite him, except as asure way to develop a large enterprise. The physical limitations of Edison’sdirect current central station were more than evident: The future foretold aninsatiable demand for small direct current central stations serving mile-squareareas and individual isolated plants, such as had been installed at J. P.Morgan’s mansion and in many factories and offices. Why shouldn’t GeorgeWestinghouse make and install electrical plants as well as Edison or Brush orSwan or Weston or Thomson-Houston? The world was brimming with ambitious youngelectricians for hire. George Westinghouse had had no trouble luring away one ofEdison’s promising young mechanical engineers, H. M. Byllesby, just by offeringa bigger salary. Preparatory to entering the electrical field with his own DCplants, Westinghouse paid Swan Incandescent Electric Light Company $50,000 toretrieve two patents they held from his new employee William Stanley. Thesepatents covered a self-regulating DC dynamo and a carbonized silk-filament lightbulb. William Stanley’s initial March 1884 contract paid him a handsome$5,000-a-year salary, with the stipulation that the company would own any of hispatented inventions it manufactured and sold. Stanley would receive 10 percentof profits. The young inventor and electrician concentrated on setting up acommercial light bulb facility in Pittsburgh and developing a DC system forWestinghouse. The new Westinghouse system had its marketing debut at the 1884Philadelphia Electric Exhibit. Reported Electrical World that September, “Thecompany are now prepared to do business. Their display comprises electric motorsas well. An ingenious arrangement of the lamps is shown by which when one goesout another is switched into circuit, and by which also a bell announcing theoccurrence can be rung at any chosen place.”5[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts5a]From the start, George Westinghouse had machines in his blood, spending hisformative years in Schenectady, New York, a small village overlooking that richcommercial waterway the Erie Canal. There young Westinghouse worked amid thepounding screech and whine of the family machine shop, which successfullymanufactured threshing machines of his father’s own design. When the War Betweenthe States broke out, George, a mere stripling of fifteen, immediately ran offto serve, as had two older brothers. His father pulled him home. Two yearslater, as the fighting and dying dragged bloodily on, George, seventeen, wasallowed to enlist, serving first with the cavalry and then with the navy. Whenthe Civil War came to its weary end, George Westinghouse briefly attended UnionCollege before returning gratefully to the family machine shop. That fall, atage nineteen, he patented his first invention, a rotary engine. Years laterWestinghouse would say, “My early greatest capital was the experience and skillacquired from the opportunity given me, when I was young, to work with all kindsof machinery, coupled later with the lessons in that discipline to which asoldier is required to submit.”6 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts6a]So, in the beginning of 1885, as George Westinghouse, industrialist-entrepreneurof Pittsburgh, marshaled his inventive faculties and his bright young electricallieutenants, he was very much a man to contend with, the founder of foursuccessful companies in the United States and overseas. Unlike Edison, whopreferred to use only his own patented work, Westinghouse already had long andreasonably happy experience with purchasing other inventors’ better ideas andimproving them in his own shops. Of course, Westinghouse in 1885 was nowherenear as famous as the flamboyant Edison. By this time, Edison was a completelylionized and beloved figure, generally a favorite with reporters, the disheveledgenius who minced no words, lived off apple pie, and embodied everything big andbold and can-do about a self-confident young nation. To the press, Westinghousewas just another successful Pittsburgh inventor and manufacturer, and worse yet,one who usually refused requests for interviews and stories. “If my face becomestoo familiar to the public, every bore or crazy schemer will insist onbuttonholing me,” he explained.7 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts7a]Even when he did grant an interview, Westinghouse rarely made for good copy. Hewas pretty dull stuff.In private, however, he was intensely compelling, forthright, blunt, oftencharismatic. Wrote one biographer of Westinghouse, “With his soft voice, hiskind eyes, and his gentle smile, he could charm a bird out of a tree. It isrelated that in a knotty negotiation it was suggested to the late Jacob H.Schiff, then the head of a great banking house, that he should meetWestinghouse. ‘No,’ said the astute old Jew, ‘I do not wish to see Mr.Westinghouse; he would persuade me.’”8[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts8a] This was Westinghouse’s charmingside. He could also be blunt to the point of offense. But Westinghouse’s publicpersona was reserved and serious. While he had a solid reputation for makingnovel technologies work in the real world, his major inventions—railroad airbrakes and automated signaling systems—however much they had improved the safetyand productivity of the nation’s most important industry, lacked the glamour andglitz of Edison’s riveting discoveries, the talking phonograph and theincandescent light. The mesmerizing French actress Sarah Bernhardt had neverbegged to meet “le grand Westinghouse.”Like Edison, Westinghouse was much liked and admired by his workers. One youngWestinghouse apprentice would always remember the following telling episode atWestinghouse Electric Company’s Garrison Alley Works:“One day several of us were back of the ‘Iron clad’ building at the side ofDuquesne Way, which was an unpaved quagmire. A young foreigner was wheelingcopper ingots unloaded from a freight car on the other side of Duquesne Way. Aniron slab served as a run-way for the wheel barrow. The wheel slipped off oneside into the soft mud. Our crowd enjoyed the predicament and jeeringly gaveadvice to the helpless lad.“Mr. Westinghouse appeared, in his long-tailed coat and high hat. He removed hisgloves, took hold of the wheel and lifted it onto the slab. He said nothing. Itmade a lasting impression on me.”9[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts9a] Here was a boss whose firstimpulse was to help, to set things right, and at the same time to drive home apowerful but unspoken lesson. They were all working together, from top tobottom.George Westinghouse, like Edison, thought money was important only as a form of“stored energy” to use as he wished in his work and expand his businesses. Hewas interested not in being rich, but in helping the world. He stroveincessantly to deliver better, more reliable products. But he had another goalalso. “My ambition is to give as many persons as possible an opportunity to earnmoney by their own efforts,” he once explained, “and this has been the reasonwhy I have tried to build up corporations which are large employers of labor,and to pay living wages, larger even than other manufacturers pay, or than theopen labor market necessitates.”10[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts10a] After his first trip to England,he instituted a half-day off on Saturdays, beginning in June 1871, the firstlocal firm to do so. Westinghouse companies would be pioneers in worker safety,disability benefits, and pensions.George Westinghouse had his great electrical epiphany in the spring of 1885while reading the English journal Engineering. For Westinghouse, his coup defoudre was reading the description of an alternating current system on displayin London at the Inventions Exhibition. This AC system used something entirelynovel—a “secondary generator” (soon to be known as a transformer)—to step downhigher AC voltages to those low enough to run individual incandescent lights.While others saw it as having limited application, Westinghouse immediatelyrealized that here was something potentially revolutionary, a new way toeconomically transfer electricity not just to individual light bulbs, but overlong distances. Right now, a DC central station had to be located in the middleof its service area. What if you could dispense with coal and steam and runelectrical generators with hydropower at faraway waterfalls, then usehigh-voltage AC to send that electricity a great distance? This transformerought to be able then to step down the high-voltage AC safely before it enteredthe factory or office building or house.It so happened that one of Westinghouse’s young employees, Guido Pantaleoni, wasin Italy because his physician father had just died. Westinghouse cabled him tolocate the inventors of the “secondary generator,” Lucien Gaulard and JohnGibbs, to see what he thought about their work. If it was all that Westinghousehoped, they should secure options on the patents. Pantaleoni did not have totravel far, it turned out, for Gaulard was in Turin, where he was demonstratingthe ability of their AC system to transmit electricity long distances from awaterfall-powered dynamo and then step it down for each individual light. Infact, Gaulard and Gibbs had been developing and exhibiting their AC system for acouple of years, but not until that spring of 1885 did it catch Westinghouse’seager attention.Over in Europe, Pantaleoni, a junior engineer, felt very uneasy renderingjudgment for his formidable boss about the commercial feasibility of what hesaw: “a fifty-mile circuit that lighted the exhibition buildings, the Turinrailway station, and stations at Veneria Reale and at Lanzo, a small village inthe Savoy Alps.”11 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts11a] So the youngman sought the advice of the far more seasoned German electrical firm of Siemensand Halske. Years later Pantaleoni would relate, “Werner von Siemens, whom I hadknown, assured me there was nothing whatsoever in alternating current, that itwas pure humbug.”12 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts12a] But knowinghow excited Westinghouse was, Pantaleoni sought other advice from a Budapestfirm, the Ganz Company, which strongly advised the young man to pursue theGaulard-Gibbs system, for they themselves were busy improving upon it (somemight say infringing upon their patent). Westinghouse bought an option on theAmerican patent rights and arranged for delivery of one of the duo’stransformers, along with a Siemens generator designed to run arc lights onalternating current.In the United States, as sultry spring turned to summer, the whole nation wasriveted by the courageous and highly public dying of revered Civil War heroUlysses S. Grant. Stricken with a fatal throat cancer, the once mighty warriorwas confined to his sickbed at the family’s East 66th Street brownstone in NewYork. There he labored determinedly through June and then July’s suffocatingheat to complete his memoir. A man of probity himself, Grant had served twoinglorious terms as a president whose administration had been marred bycorruption. Then the ex-president found himself unwittingly enmeshed in amortifying $14 million Wall Street banking swindle, only to be bailed out by thekindness of the nation’s richest man, William H. Vanderbilt. Grant hoped hismemoir would sell enough to erase his humiliating debts. His dignity during hisslow and painful decline, and the ex-president’s determination to salvage hishonor, to assert the importance of simple honesty, had restored the general tothe nation’s deepest affections. As the July heat pressed in, the Grant familysought out the cool mountain air near upstate Saratoga, where the ever frailersoldier, wrapped in shawls, painstakingly revised his page proofs with the helpof his editor and publisher, Samuel Clemens. On July 23, within days offinishing, Grant died peacefully. In New York City, the morning air reverberatedwith a solemn clangor of hundreds of church bells, punctuated by the newsboysyelling: “Extra! Extra!” Black-bordered editions featured page after pagesanctifying the humble beginnings and heroic deeds of the great general of theGrand Army of the Republic, the man who had saved the Union. Within hours, thecity’s thousands of American flags were at half-mast and buildings draped indeepest black. Like Edison and Westinghouse, Grant was a small-town boy who hadrisen to great deeds from very ordinary circumstances.Grant’s New York funeral was an epic panoply of public grief, such as would beforever remembered by all who were present. On the blue, warm dawn of August 8,like an incoming tide, a vast sea of one and a half million Americans of everyrank and class flowed in, engulfing the six-mile funeral route from Manhattan’sCity Hall all the way north to Riverside Park, where Grant would be buried. Allwere there to honor Grant and pay homage to the nation’s very survival. “By 9o’clock every balcony, window, and door commanding a view of the line of marchwas teeming; the roofs and cornices swarmed,” reported The New York Times.“There was not an accessible point, however high and dangerous, but had itsobserver: men climbed the telegraph poles and clung to the wires; boys were highin the trees; carriages and wagons thronged the crossings where the police wouldallow them … the statues in the squares were black with climbers, and even thelamp post granted many a foothold.”13[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts13a] At 10:00 A.M., as the air beganto shimmer with heat, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock cantered forth on hismagnificent black charger, followed by his staff. The funeral cortege set out onits slow and somber procession north. As far as the eye could see, behindGeneral Hancock flowed a mighty river of military display: “massed regiments intheir brilliant uniforms, their guns glistening in the sun, their colors draped,and their slow steps keeping time to the music of the many dirges for the dead.”Hour after hour, as the heat intensified, the columns of soldiers, sailors, andmarines swept by in all their finest military precision. Then followedvolunteers and militia from many states, even the old Confederacy, marching,marching in columns to band music or muffled drums. And, finally, came theremains of the great dead hero Ulysses S. Grant, his purple-draped catafalquesolemn and humble atop a black wagon drawn by twenty-four horses, eachmajestically caparisoned with purple, each horse led by a young black man inbroadcloth and silk hat.All through the silent, respectful sea of mourners, men and boys swept off theirhats, while women dabbed their eyes and tears trickled silently down. Nextrumbled past an elegant multitude of fine carriages, ferrying President GroverCleveland and a wide array of the nation’s political and diplomatic luminaries.The great state funeral had lasted four hours, but only at the very end came themost poignant of all the military sights: the aging, marching veterans of theCivil War—eighteen thousand strong—who had fought a full two decades ago,whether under Grant or Lee. On this day they were one. The crowds were shroudedin a respectful silence rare in that cacophonous city. Grant’s funeral served asyet another reminder that the old, rural, preindustrial America was passing. TheNorth with its railroads and superior communications had prevailed. No longerwere great landowners the most wealthy and powerful. Now it was the easternfinanciers and industrialists who were ascendant, the men who ruled the nation.Grant’s classic memoir became a runaway bestseller, salvaging his honor and hiswidow’s finances.So when Pantaleoni sailed back into Manhattan from the Continent, he returned toa nation just out of mourning. Not long behind him on another ocean steamerfollowed Reginald Belfield, an English employee of Gaulard-Gibbs who wasbringing with him their “secondary transformers.” Wrote Belfield, “I arrived inAmerica on the 22nd of November 1885, where I immediately saw Mr. GeorgeWestinghouse and Mr. Herman Westinghouse.”14[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts14a] One can safely assume that onceensconced in Pittsburgh, Belfield found his first encounter with the gloomyindustrial boomtown as astounding as did all other newcomers. Located in the farwestern hills of Pennsylvania, where the swift-flowing Allegheny and theMonongahela Rivers merged to form the broad and busy Ohio River, Pittsburgh hadthe advantage of being a pivotal river port. Pittsburgh also served as a majorterminus for the powerful Pennsylvania Railroad (whose arrogance toward thelocals had led the 1877 labor rioters to burn and loot the road’s depot, yards,and trains). Equally important, the surrounding hills and valleys contained someof the world’s richest coalfields, which cheaply fed the city’s hundreds offilthy, belching factories and mills. When English writer Anthony Trollopepassed through hardworking Pittsburgh in 1862, he found it “the blackest place …I ever saw.” Six years later, about the same time that George Westinghouserelocated his works to Pittsburgh because all that coal made casting steel frogscheap, author James Parton decried a city so ugly and grimy that “every streetappears to end in a huge black cloud … [it was] smoke, smoke, smoke—everywheresmoke.” In short, it was “Hell with the lid taken off.”15[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts15a]In 1882, a very proud Andrew Carnegie brought his idol, Darwinist HerbertSpencer, to view what the steelman cherished as Pittsburgh’s utopian might.Spencer’s verdict as his train steamed away from the stinky black haze: “Sixmonths residence here would justify suicide.”16[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts16a] An observer arriving in the sameyear as Reginald Belfield wrote, “Pittsburg [as it was spelled from 1890 to1911] of to-day looks in the distance like a huge volcano, continually belchingforth smoke and flames. By day a great pall rests over the city, obscuring thesun, and by night the glow and flash of the almost numberless iron-mills whichfill the valley and cover the hill-sides, light the sky with a fiery glare. Thisgreat workshop of the modern Cyclops is one of the most important manufacturingcenters of the country, and embodies our most valuable interests in iron andsteel manufactures…. Though the suburbs of the city are beautiful and containmany charming residences, the aspect of the city itself is grimy and gloomy, inspite of the noble business blocks and open, spacious streets.”17[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts17a]Those who could afford it, like the Westinghouses, lived amid the floweringhedgerows and dappled lawns of suburban Homewood, six miles east of downtown onthe Pennsylvania Railroad line. And it was there that Belfield was taken on thatfirst day in late November 1885 to live as a guest of the family. The whitebrick Westinghouse villa, George’s surprise birthday present to Marguerite in1871, featured a square tower, a fashionable mansard roof, and twenty acres ofsurrounding gardens and lawns. It also had its own railway siding forWestinghouse’s private railcar. But when Belfield came that late fall, thesummer flowers had long since fallen before the first frosts. The villa wasmisnamed Solitude, for the Westinghouses loved to entertain and always hadcompany around. “Hospitality,” wrote one Westinghouse biographer of George, “washis greatest diversion and in this he was ably assisted by Mrs. Westinghouse. Itwas their normal life to have several guests in the house, and to have adinner-party every night. The varied company included distinguished men of manylands.”18 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts18a]A famously genial and charming host, Westinghouse would frequently call his wifeduring the day from the office to say he would be bringing two, four, or eventen home to dine. The usual guests were business associates and their wives, butthose Pittsburgh locals often arrived to find a distinguished sprinkling ofvisiting scientists, railroad executives, and foreign notables who had happenedto be in town touring the big Westinghouse works. Marguerite, reported the localSocial Mirror, “lives in greater style, entertains more splendidly, and wearsmore gorgeous, varied, elegant toilets, has more and finer diamonds than anywoman in Pittsburgh.”19 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts19a] Thetable always glittered with beautiful Sèvres and Dresden china, crystal, andsolid silver and gold silverware, but the food was very simple and healthful.Westinghouse always made his own salad dressing and heard and said nothing whileconcentrating completely on this private dining ritual. If the dinner discussionbecame technical, Isaac Watson, the black butler, would discreetly hand hisemployer a pencil and pad. When Westinghouse had made whatever notes andsketches he wished, Watson would retrieve it and put it on a table in thelibrary. Westinghouse might repair later with a few others there or to hisbilliards room, where papers could be spread out on the green baize, diagramsstudied, and plans drawn.Reginald Belfield, when he stepped off onto the Pennsylvania Railroad stop a fewhundred yards from Solitude, may have noticed a towering wooden structure backbehind the lovely villa. It was, strangely enough, a large natural gas well.Westinghouse had become interested in natural gas the previous year and had sunkan initial well, but as Pantaleoni would later recount, it was disparaged by thepresident of the local gas company as nice enough but little. “If there was athing that would cause Mr. W. to fight it was the thought that anything he wasin was small and insignificant. Within a day or two a new rig was put in … witha terrific roar the tools were thrown out and smashed the hot house, as the mostphenomenal well of Natural Gas was ‘in.’ For days you could not hear your ownvoice in the Homewood residence…. [Westinghouse] alone had a never disappearingsmile on his beaming face, while the Fire Department was pumping water over thehouse to prevent it from catching fire from the burning gas. The PhiladelphiaCompany (natural gas) was born.”20[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts20a]Just as Westinghouse was getting enthralled with electricity, he had startedthis new natural gas venture and invented an entire delivery system (for whichhe secured thirty-six patents). This patented system depended on the naturalhigh pressure of the released gas pushing through narrow pipes for severalmiles, whereupon it was lowered to a pressure safe for use in homes andfactories by the gradual widening of the pipes as the gas flowed into thefactory or house. And so, historian Steven W. Usselman points out, one sees acertain theme emerging in Westinghouse’s early enterprises: “First, theyinvolved transmission over distance.” With air brakes, compressed air wastransmitted; with railroad signals, electricity; and with natural gas, the gasitself through pipes. But Usselman’s second observation is, “Many of thetechnologies that George Westinghouse pursued involved a crucial linkingmechanism that served to connect the long-distance transmission lines with therest of the system. Often these devices incorporated feedback mechanisms thatregulated the system.”21 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts21a] It waslittle wonder that Westinghouse was finding himself drawn to the field ofelectrical power, for it meshed with his longtime inclinations and experience.However, even as Westinghouse eagerly awaited the arrival of Belfield and theGaulard-Gibbs apparatus in the fall of 1885, his leading electrician, WilliamStanley, had become unwell (perhaps the unhealthful Pittsburgh smog?). He hadexpressed discontent even back in the spring, having written his new wife, “Ithink that I will surely get up and leave Pittsburgh for good.”22[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts22a] Stanley had been through manyjobs and situations before coming to Westinghouse, and his early employer, theinventor Hiram Maxim, had said that Stanley may have been “very tall and thin,but what he lacked in bulk he made up in speed. Nothing went fast enough forhim.”23 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts23a] Now, once more Stanleywas chafing. He preferred inventing on his own. By summer, Stanley had decidedto relocate with his wife to the far more healthful and bucolic Berkshire Hillsof Massachusetts, where he had vacationed as a child with his grandparents. Hewould, however, continue to work for Westinghouse. “My health gave out,” Stanleywould say later, “and there seemed to be grave questions as to my ability towithstand Pittsburgh and its work.”24[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts24a]But now, at last, in the final days of November, Reginald Belfield had arrivedand gotten right down to business at Westinghouse’s grimy Garrison Alley Worksin Pittsburgh, there unpacking all that he had brought from its wooden crate. Itwas not an encouraging sight. “The Gaulard and Gibbs apparatus from England [theprototransformer] was sent in a very unsatisfactory condition,” he would laterwrite. “The work in the various parts was very faulty; portions not properlysoldered only held together by the flux. The impression this gave was so badthat Mr. Pantaleoni was going to telegraph to London canceling the arrangementthat had been made. Here Mr. Westinghouse stepped in and with his well-knownsympathy towards a new invention, gave me another chance, for which I was mostgrateful, so that I had to practically reconstruct the entire apparatus andbuild most of it anew. This made a great deal of hard work but the result wassatisfactory, inasmuch as Mr. Westinghouse determined to take up the apparatus.During this period I was staying at Solitude, and had occasion every night todiscuss the matter with him, and the future development of the system.”25[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts25a]The first transformer had actually been created by Michael Faraday, just as thefirst generator had. In a transformer, the “primary” is the copper wire that isfed electric current, generating a magnetic field. The “secondary” is the copperwire that intercepts the primary’s field of force. The two interact,self-inducing voltage. In an effective transformer, the two coils of copper wiremust be coupled perfectly to create high self-induction. However, no one reallyunderstood the full potential of Faraday’s prototransformer back in 1831, anymore than most electricians did in 1885. Faraday had coiled many turns of aninsulated wire around a bar of soft iron and then taken a second insulated wireand coiled that around the first. When alternating current was sent through thefirst coil, the second coil would also begin to generate current. The voltage ofthe insulated wire was purely a function of how many times it was coiled aroundthe iron bar. The greater the number of wrapped coils, the higher the voltagewould rise. Send that same alternating current into another iron bar with fewercoils wrapped around it and the voltage would diminish. A very rudimentarytransformer. William Stanley said later in life, “I have a very personalaffection for a transformer. It is such a complete and simple solution for adifficult problem.”26 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts26a] So simple,few appreciated it. Westinghouse and his engineers did. “It is to beremembered,” Stanley said later, “that at this time, that is, in 1885, therewere no alternating current machines built in America. [There were Europeanimports.] The only transformers or induction coils that I knew of were three orfour or more of the Gaulard type that had been imported from England.”27[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts27a] Moreover, these transformersworked only with alternating current—for the swift oscillations of AC electronscreated a magnetic field around them as they coursed along that was the key tothe transformer’s induction. If electricity was to travel far distances, thatelectricity could only be AC.The Gaulard-Gibbs transformer that Reginald Belfield rebuilt at the Westinghouseplant in late November, he explained, “consisted of a bundle of iron wireforming the magnetic circuit surrounded by a large number of copper discs,having a hole in their centers, one to each turn of both primary and secondary,and each soldered to its neighbor, this multitude of soldered joints, each asource of trouble, was most impractical and very expensive to make.” HistorianHarold C. Passer notes that an English technical journal of the time dismissedGaulard-Gibbs and their transformer because more famous electricians who hadworked in the field already would not “have allowed this subject to dwindle awayto mere nothingness had there been a chance of bringing the matter to asuccessful issue.”28 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts28a] The twoinventors themselves did not really understand the potential of their system,for they were using the transformer merely to step down voltages to individuallight bulbs.George Westinghouse, as was his wont, thoroughly enjoyed examining the wholeGaulard-Gibbs apparatus and then disassembling it. He discussed it at greatlength with Reginald Belfield all during December at Solitude. Belfield laterrecalled, “Those who knew Mr. Westinghouse will fully realize the great energyhe threw into this question…. In an astonishingly short time [by the end of theyear] the absolutely uncommercial [Gaulard-Gibbs] secondary generator wasconverted into the modern transformer.”29[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts29a] A whole new design emerged thatcould be cheaply produced by machines: H-shaped iron plates that could bemachine stamped now formed the core. The horizontal part of the H would passthrough copper wire coils that could be machine wound and would serve as theprimary and secondary. The ends were closed by means of I-shaped plates. Voilà!George Westinghouse had developed the modern transformer. His greatestinnovation was organizing the transformers in parallel, with the number ofparallels allowing great increases in voltage. Nonetheless, Pantaleoni reportsthat his fellow electricians at Westinghouse were still firmly againsthigh-voltage alternating current and using the new transformer to increasevoltages as they left the generator and to step it back down as it enteredbuildings. “The opposition by ALL the electric part of the Westinghouseorganization was such that it was only Mr. George Westinghouse’s personal willthat put it through.”30 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts30a] WilliamStanley, who was busy installing his first Westinghouse DC system that fall,seems to have been the only other enthusiast for AC aside from his boss. No onebesides Westinghouse understood the tremendous breakthrough represented by theAC transformer: a machine that could take high voltages that had traveled longdistances and step them down for safe use in entire factories or homes.Undeterred by the chorus of naysayers at his own company, Westinghouserenegotiated William Stanley’s contract, and Stanley now prepared his new GreatBarrington laboratory on Main Street for AC work. Reginald Belfield would comenorth to the snow-covered rolling hills to assist. In preparation for the wintrycold, Belfield bought an “American ready-made cloth coat” at Kaufman’sDepartment Store in Pittsburgh just before Christmas. The coat came with acomplimentary Waterbury watch. When Westinghouse saw it, the ever curiousmagnate had to take it apart at once. Recalled Belfield, “Mr. Westinghouse wasnot satisfied with taking the watch to pieces once, but he took it to piecesmany times and put it together again, and it speaks volumes for his mechanicalingenuity that the watch never suffered for the treatment.”31[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts31a]Now that George Westinghouse had his transformer, there was the real andthrilling prospect of leading an electrical revolution, something far beyonddirect current incandescence. On January 8, 1886, Westinghouse entered the frayofficially, incorporating his fifth company, the Westinghouse Electric Company,with stock worth $1 million. The Pittsburgh magnate assumed the presidency,initially holding 18,000 of the 20,000 shares valued at $50 each. In the comingmonths, Westinghouse sold almost 8,400 shares to finance his new venture.William Stanley received 2,000 shares of Westinghouse Electric stock, a salaryof $4,000 a year, and $600 a month for laboratory expenses.32[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts32a] Any Stanley inventions developedby Westinghouse for commercial use were the company’s. The next major move wasto dispatch Guido Pantaleoni and a Westinghouse attorney to Europe to buy theAmerican patent rights to the Gaulard-Gibbs transformer for $50,000. Pantaleoniwould find that others in Europe were hot on the same technical trail.By early January of 1886, Belfield was in Great Barrington, busy constructingH-shaped transformers in Stanley’s old barn. Once these pioneering commercialtransformers were ready, Belfield (presumably in his warm Kaufman’s coat) bravedthe February cold to string four thousand feet of heavy copper electrical wireonto ceramic conductors fastened to the huge bare elms of Barrington’s MainStreet. Concerned about competitors seeing the six transformers, Stanley encasedeach one in a wooden box installed out of sight in the basements of thosebuildings to be lighted. A steam engine was readied to provide power to thegenerator. Stanley then left town for a fortnight’s vacation and rest.Upon his return in early March, Stanley was chagrined to find that the Edisonpeople had gotten the jump on him, becoming the first to dazzle Great Barringtonwith the miracle of incandescent light. The Edison light was showcased in alocal mansion, where the company had installed a conventional direct currentisolated plant. On March 10, 1886, the Berkshire Courier reported breathlesslyon the Edison light in an article headlined A BRILLIANT SPECTACLE. The storynoted, “During the last few evenings the Hopkins premises have been brilliantlyilluminated upon the balconies and piazzas of the homestead, while the interiorof the new home was brilliantly lighted, as were the surrounding grounds.” In aforthright commentary on the very real fear of this brand-new technology, thenewspaper also reported, “A fire engine … stands ready to promptly extinguishany fires that may break out upon the works.”33[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts33a]A week later William Stanley, twenty-eight, fired up the coal-powered25-horsepower steam engine in the old barn by his Main Street laboratory. As theSiemens AC generator came to life, it began transmitting 500 volts of ACelectricity out on the strung copper wires, which hummed along under the statelyelms and into the basement of the store owned by his cousin R. I. Taylor, thereto be stepped down through the transformer to 100 volts, which ran up throughthe interior wires to the incandescent bulbs. On March 17, the Berkshire Courierreported, “Last evening the interior and exterior of R. I. Taylor’s store waslighted by three 150 candle power electric lights of the Stanley system. Two ofthe lights in the store made it as light as noon-day. A large number ofbusinessmen were present to witness the effect, and were unanimous in theirpraise thereof.”34 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts34a] On that sameday, Stanley reported back to Westinghouse in a letter that he had run asuccessful test: “All the converters [transformers] are under lock and key sothat no one knows anything about them…. I might say a great deal about thesystem, but briefly, it is all right.”35[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts35a] Within the week Stanley had alsoconnected up a drugstore, another general store, and a doctor’s office. Hundredsof local citizens came out for a gala Saturday night viewing, strolling in thebrisk March evening under the barely budding elms to see for themselves the muchballyhooed incandescent light. Said Stanley, “My townspeople, though veryskeptical as to the dangers to be encountered when going near the lights,rejoiced with me.” The newspaper marveled how inside the stores the electriclights were “so powerful and so perfectly white, that green and blue can bereadily distinguished though they cannot by gas light.”36[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts36a] By the end of the month Stanleyhad several dozen new customers, including a handful of local doctors, thebilliards parlor, the post office, a stove store, a shoe store, and L. B.Brusie’s restaurant. The Edison people were not sitting back, but they still hadonly half a dozen customers. They were limited by distance, as Stanley was not.Rarely had such a major technological breakthrough—one with such vastimplications for the future of electricity—been introduced so quietly anddiscreetly.Stanley, of course, had stayed absolutely mum on the nature of the new ACsystem, so the local newspaper had made no distinction between his enterpriseand the rival installations by the Edison people. Only a handful of people inAmerica could appreciate the monumental nature of this pathbreaking new lightingsystem, among them the Pittsburgh visitors who arrived by train on April 6.George Westinghouse had eagerly traveled over from his factories with hisbrother Henry, along with Pantaleoni and inventor-engineer Franklin Pope, to seefirsthand William Stanley and Reginald Belfield’s great electrical achievement.Here, for the historic first time in America, high-voltage electricity had beengenerated, transmitted, and then stepped down via newly designed transformers toa safe level for domestic consumption. No longer would electric central powerstations, with all their coal and noise and smoke, have to be situated inwalking distance of urban customers. Generating stations could be located farout of cities, nearer to their fuel sources, and their electricity dispatchedquietly in great wire grids, humming across fields and rivers to deliver clean,quiet power. Several weeks later, the whole Westinghouse group returned yetagain to admire and study the further expanded AC system at work. Stanley haddesigned a more reliable generator to replace the Siemens, which was reallymeant to run arc lights. Now every aspect of this new system had to berigorously tested and improved, preparatory to invading the market and changingthe world. Westinghouse directed that a new version of Stanley’s AC system beinstalled back in Pittsburgh at the Union Switch and Signal Company and anelectrical line strung three miles out to East Liberty. Transformers wereestablished at each end, and throughout the summer the system was run and testedrepeatedly. By fall, Westinghouse was ready to begin seeking his own place inthe new electrical firmament, as he offered the world its first commercial ACincandescent system. Unlike Edison, who launched his every new invention withmaximum public ballyhoo, George Westinghouse introduced his lighting revolutionvery quietly. No press account heralded the tremendous breakthrough of AC, thebursting of the DC shackles. The AC revolution began quietly and almostinvisibly.image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_011_r1.jpg]George Westinghouse’s inaugural customer in his low-key electrical revolutionwas the Buffalo emporium of Adam, Meldrum & Anderson, a gigantic four-storyItalianate palace of manifold consumer delights located on that upstate New Yorkcity’s prestigious Main Street. Buffalo was growing rich as the transit pointfor immigrants flooding west on the railroads and for all manner of crops andgoods—notably bumper midwestern grain harvests and gigantic herds oflivestock—heading back east. The broad Buffalo waterfront was lined withmonumental grain elevators, and there the mountainous piles of grain werebought, priced, and stored before being funneled onward to New York City andmarkets abroad. A wealthy Great Lakes port, terminus of the Erie Canal, andnational railway crossroads, Buffalo was poised for commercial glory.Right after Thanksgiving, a front-page ad in the November 27, 1886, BuffaloCommercial Advertiser proclaimed that Adam, Meldrum & Anderson (despitemonth-long problems and delays) was now showcasing its incomparable selection ofblack cashmeres, carpets, draperies, bed and horse blankets, cloaks and shawls,dolls, and so forth with 498 Stanley lights run by the Westinghouse system.“There is no odor, no heat, no matches, no danger. We were the first businesshouse in the city to adopt the plan of lighting our stores by incandescence….The appearance is brilliant in the extreme. The light is steady and colorless.Shades can be perfectly matched. Come and see the grandest invention of thenineteenth century.”37 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts37a] Twoevenings later, on a Monday, the mammoth store was open—not to retail any of itslovely lace handkerchiefs, gloves, silk umbrellas, finest black silks, oreiderdown quilts, but purely to show off the Westinghouse lights. “No goods weresold,” reported the Commercial Advertiser, “and the store was so thronged withvisitors that it was difficult to get about.” The well-dressed crowds streamedup and down the four floors to ooh and aah over the lights, exclaiming how akinit was to pure sunlight, how truly you could see the colors in the India shawlsand the weave in the draperies. The Adam, Meldrum & Anderson store was just oneof numerous spaces in Buffalo now luminous with electricity, including arclights and rival incandescent plants. Consequently, “The store was visited lastevening by quite a number of gentlemen interested in the different lightingcompanies of the city, and others, and all expressed great admiration at thisWestinghouse light.” Again, as in Great Barrington, the newspapers did notmention (or presumably know) that this new system marked a profound andmomentous change in the commercial delivery of electricity. Nor did Westinghousemake any great public declarations. But AC’s virtues were swiftly appreciated bythose who could not be served by DC. Westinghouse soon had orders fromtwenty-seven new customers in numerous locales.Back in Manhattan at 65 Fifth Avenue, Thomas Edison smoked his cigar and stewed,deeply incensed to learn that the Westinghouse Electric Company was invading thefield of incandescent lighting, turf pioneered by Edison. The Brush ElectricCompany specialized in arc lights, but Edison disdained that product as aninterim solution doomed to extinction. Edward Weston had developed anincandescent light bulb, but as far as Edison was concerned, Weston had simplystolen his light bulb and come up with a workable but inferior DC system. He wasno great threat. Thomson-Houston was just another patent pirate, though theycertainly hustled. Edison’s patent lawyers were after them in the courts. ButWestinghouse was altogether another matter, a formidable rival with immenseachievements and access to major capital. He was not a man to scoff at, deride,or dismiss. The Pittsburgh industrialist was reputed to be a real fighter who,once decided, pursued a course of action full bore. And while Westinghouseflourished in the golden age of the robber barons, he very definitely was notone himself. In an era of flagrant venality and corruption, he remained atremendous idealist and genuine democrat, completely dedicated to making theworld a better place through engineering and machines. Whatever new project helaunched, he was looking to be the best. Like Edison, he thoroughly enjoyedworking in the noisy, dirty shops among his men, inquiring about the state oftheir projects, and infusing everyone with his own zest.Understandably, then, Edison was concerned when he heard that a man like GeorgeWestinghouse was scaling his, Thomas Edison’s, electrical Olympus. Moreover, thePittsburgh magnate was entering the electrical arena equipped with somethingnew, something potentially revolutionary. Edison was feeling deeply bitter aboutthis new competition. He wrote darkly to Johnson: “Just as certain as deathWestinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a [AC]system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal ofexperimenting to get it working practically. It will never be free from danger.”Edison was utterly perplexed by how the whole AC business could be practical,writing in the same report, “I cannot for the life of me see how alternatingcurrent high-pressure mains—which in large cities can never stop—could berepaired. Whereas the main of the direct current would not produce death if aman received a shock.”38 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts38a] Herewere the first angry rumblings in the coming hostilities that would come to beknown as the War of the Electric Currents, a war between two titans whosetechnology was so potent, it was already changing the world."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_020_r1.jpg]New Street looking to Wall Street, New York City, during the blizzard of 1888CHAPTER 6Edison Declares WarAs most of Manhattan slept on Monday, March 12, 1888, a howling rainstormengulfed the city. Its freezing downpour inflicted sodden misery on the armiesof the poor huddled atop steam grates and curled up in the nooks and crannies ofpiers and alleys. The deluge coarsened into sleet, then thickened into drivingsnow. All night, the storm roared on. By dawn, its sixty-mile-an-hour winds wereshoving the deep snow into drifts as high as second-story windows. Whenmiddle-class New Yorkers arose Tuesday morning, they were indignant to find theyhad no morning newspapers at their snowbound doors, no fresh milk from themilkman, no hot rolls from the baker. Instead, there was only an icy tornado ofwhite screeching up the avenues. The temperature was a bone-numbing fivedegrees. Everywhere the great spiderwebs of electric wires sagged and collapsed,broken by the weight of the ice.Reported The New York Times, “Before the day had well advanced, every horse carand elevated railroad train in this city had stopped running; the streets werealmost impassable to men or horses by reason of the huge masses of driftingsnow; the electric wires—telegraph and telephone—connecting spots in this cityor opening communication with places outside were nearly all broken; hardly atrain was sent out from the city or came into it during the entire day; themails were stopped, and every variety of business dependent on motion orlocomotion was stopped…. Probably if it had not been for the blizzard the peopleof this city might have gone on for an indefinite time enduring the nuisance ofelectric wires dangling from poles.” The newspaper once again urged the electricwires all be buried, citing the very specific hazards: “The city is liable to beput into darkness and the consequent perils. There is also the danger ofconflagration through the failure of the fire alarm wires.”1[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts1a] Nowhere was mentioned thepossibility of people being electrocuted. The blizzard of 1888, with itstwenty-two inches, stood for sixty years as the city’s worst snowstorm.It was just about a month later that the great public fear of electrical “deathby wire” began. On the cold, clear Saturday night of April 15, 1888, a youth inhigh spirits was heading along East Broadway toward Catherine Street, skippingand leaping. The snow was long gone, and most of the thick webs of electricwires had not been buried but were once again restrung on the forests of cedarpoles. That crisp April evening, carriages were rolling by, their shiny cabs andsleek horses gleaming in the bright street arc lights. Passersby noticed thebounding boy seize one of the broken telegraph wires dangling down from highabove. Wire in hand, he playfully skipped around and around the toweringtelegraph pole, when amid a spurting shower of sparks, the boy staggered backand fell reeling on the dirty sidewalk. A crowd quickly gathered and theambulance corps soon galloped up to take the boy, later identified as Moses (orMeyer) Streiffer, to the Chambers Street Hospital. But he was dead.The New-York Daily Tribune editorialized, “It is almost a pity that it wasn’t amillionaire or other leading citizen that was killed by the electric light wireon Sunday morning. If it had been, the community would have been startled, andits indignation might have brought the wires underground. But it was only a poorboy peddler—a little fellow fifteen years old, a Rumanian, a stranger in thisgreat city, selling collar buttons and pocket combs from a modest tray to helpsupport his mother and eight brothers and sisters. A wire had been swinging formonths from a pole near where the boy took his stand, he happened to touch it,gave ‘a sort of a quack,’ the policeman said, and was dead.” The U.S.Illuminating Company, which ran its arc lights off high-voltage wires strungalong the avenues, was charged with neglect for allowing dangerous wires todangle.2 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts2a]In the spring of 1888, “death by wire” became, for the first time, a greatpreoccupation of the New York papers. “Overhead cables suddenly leaped intoprominence not only as eyesores but as a public peril,” notes Westinghousebiographer Francis Leupp. “Leading newspapers which till then had confined theirdiscussion to the expediency of exchanging gas for electricity, began, withastonishing unanimity, to make a display of every happening that could be usedto excite animosity in the popular mind toward the [high-voltage] alternatingcurrent.”3 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts3a] The newspapers’ risingindignation mirrored that of Thomas Edison, long a darling of the New Yorkpress. Suddenly alert to every casualty and fatality caused by high-voltageelectrical wires, the press now gave full attention to the scandalous, tangledstate of Manhattan’s overhead electrical wires and the dangers posed byhigh-voltage arc light wires.Less than a month after the peddler boy Streiffer died, there was anotherelectrical victim. On Friday, May 11, a lovely spring day, a Brush ElectricCompany worker was up cutting away old wires on a second-story cornice at 616-18Broadway, high above the thick port traffic below on West Houston. An employeeinside one of the buildings “saw smoke curling in the window and heard aspluttering sound. He found Murray dead and one of the electric wires partly cutthrough and the insulating material burning at the point where it was cut.”4[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts4a] The lineman for the arc lightcompany had failed to wear his heavy gloves and was electrocuted. Rescuerstrying to pull the body in through the window were promptly shocked. Finallythey obtained some rubber sheets and, after wrapping the corpse in those, pulledthe poor charred fellow off the cornice and took him over to the Tenth PrecinctStation House. For six years, arc lights and their wires had been viewed as aneyesore and a nuisance in Manhattan. But now, the citizenry would begin toassociate high-voltage electricity with danger and death, just as did ThomasEdison.Ever since George Westinghouse had turned on the lights in the Buffalo emporiumof Adam, Meldrum & Anderson, Thomas Edison had been plagued by a steady streamof bad electrical news. In late 1886, Edison had jauntily written off his newrival, George Westinghouse, claiming, “None of his plans worries me in theleast,” albeit conceding that the “only thing that disturbs me is thatWestinghouse is a great man for flooding the country with agents and travelers.He is ubiquitous and will form numerous companies before we know anything aboutit.”5 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts5a] Indeed, with each passingmonth, Westinghouse was proving a more and more formidable threat to Edisondominance.The hard-charging Westinghouse, after but one year in business, had constructedor had under contract 68 AC central stations. He had come from nowhere to loomas Edison’s biggest competitor. Thomson-Houston, which had flourished primarilyas an arc light company, had also taken up installing AC central stations justthat spring, using Westinghouse transformers. They had already up or undercontract 22 AC central stations. At the end of 1887, from the seat of hiseight-year-old empire in Manhattan, Edison had built or had under contract 121DC central stations in places as far-flung as Birmingham, Alabama, and GrandRapids, Michigan. The Edison Electric Light Company’s executives, in their 1887annual report issued in late October, put a brave face on the AC situation,denouncing this electrical alternative as “from a commercial standpoint, havingno merit in itself and, being of high pressure … notoriously destructive of bothlife and property.”6 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts6a]Edison was especially galled that Westinghouse had installed a big AC centralstation in New Orleans. Edison already had a plant in that steamy Louisiana portand viewed it as his exclusive incandescent turf. The 1887 Edison annual reportchortled over the many Westinghouse woes there—constant breakdowns, transformersruined by lightning, no AC motors for those who wanted to use their electricityfor more than lighting. The report quoted W. T. Mottram, their Edison manager,as saying he was “thoroughly convinced that the Edison system is unassailable …they cannot compete with us or do us any permanent harm, and that a steadyconservative policy will win the battle.”7[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts7a] Brave words, these, and fine forthe public, but meanwhile Edward Johnson was tartly rebuking Edison that withoutAC “we will do no small town business, or even much headway in cities of minorsize.”8 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts8a] What were the Edisonsalesmen to say to city fathers who needed electricity for homes and factoriesmore than half a mile away from the DC central station?Out in the far-flung marketplace of new central stations, the Edison camp wasencountering continual and embittering setbacks. If a town bought a DC plant, itmight well serve only half those who wanted electric lights. Those who livedmore than half a mile away had to contemplate buying individual isolated plantsor a whole other central station. In stark contrast, one AC station could servethe whole place and could be expanded as necessary to accommodate continuedgrowth. So Thomas Edison’s rancor toward Westinghouse continued to fester andgrow with each passing month of 1887.It was not that Edison did not have ready access to his own AC system. Even asWestinghouse was installing his first AC plant in late 1886, Edison’s own peoplehad been giving thorough consideration to buying a European-developed AC systemthat was causing a sensation on the Continent. Francis Jehl, a longtime Edisonemployee, had been in Europe on business in early 1885 when he was asked totravel to Budapest, with its famous castle and cafés, to look at the GanzCompany’s new AC system. It was dubbed ZBD for its Hungarian inventors, CharlesZipernowsky, Otto Titus Blathy, and Max Deri. Jehl later recalled that inBudapest, “at the exhibition grounds I found 1,000 or more incandescent lightsoperating from an alternator running at a pressure of 1,300 volts. It was an‘eye opener,’ for the pressure was reduced to that required by the lamps bymeans of poleless induction coils for which the Hungarian inventors called orcoined the word transformers.”9 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts9a]Jehl, who had once pumped the air out of the early incandescent bulbs at MenloPark, described all the young European electricians as abuzz over AC.The first ZBD customer had been none other than the Edison Company in Milan, runby John Lieb, former chief electrician of the Pearl Street Station. Lieb, whowent down in history as the man who stood on his tiptoes to first pull the PearlStreet switch, had successfully launched the Milan branch. Wishing to light up anew customer, the Theater dal Verm, which was beyond the reach of the existingEdison DC mains, he had used the new ZBD system. So all through 1886 Lieb sangthe wonders of AC, pleading with Edison to buy the ZBD patents. One of the ZBDinventors, Dr. Otto Titus Blathy of the Ganz Company, was equally anxious tohook up with Edison, for the Edison imprimatur would be the ultimate electricalaccolade, a surefire guarantee of instant luminous glory and dominance. WhenEdison waffled and stalled, the good Hungarian doctor sailed to New York topersonally lobby the great inventor, arriving in September of 1886. Edison stillagreed to nothing, but he dispatched to Paris Francis Upton, who now ran thelamp company and had once supplied the math and physics back in the Menlo Parkdays. As Westinghouse had struggled to get its first AC system installed andfunctioning in the fancy Buffalo emporium, Upton had arrived in Paris, inspectedthe ZBD system, and strongly recommended the Edison Company buy an option on theAmerican rights for $20,000.When Edison had consulted Siemens and Halske of Berlin, they criticized the ZBDsystem as expensive, troublesome, and dangerous. They had, of course, givensimilar advice to Pantaleoni when he was considering the Gaulard and Gibbsapparatus for George Westinghouse. Pressed on all sides by his top men, Edisonhad reluctantly taken the option on the ZBD patent, well aware that Westinghousewas already launched. Yet he stubbornly and proudly refused even to considerusing this AC system. Historians W. Bernard Carlson and A. J. Millard believethat Edison genuinely “feared that poorly designed and installed a.c. systemswould impede the broad adoption of electric power.”10[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts10a] One suspects a furthercause—stubborn pride of authorship. Every aspect of the Edison DC system hadbeen created from scratch by Edison or his colleagues. It is easy to imagine himobstinately balking at incorporating the inventions of others, especially if hecould convince himself that their technology was dangerous.The year 1887 was thoroughly trying to Edison. Not only was Westinghousechallenging Edison with his AC systems, the price of copper was also suddenly onthe rise. This was worrisome for all electricians, for copper, with its peerlessqualities of malleability and conductivity, was a major and critical componentof their business. In December of 1887, the Journal of Engineering and Mininghad explained the sharp rise—from ten cents a pound to sixteen cents a pound—asthe work of “a powerful combination in Europe who have managed the wholebusiness in a very skillful manner.”11[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts11a] And indeed, across the wintryAtlantic in the business precincts of Paris could be found the mastermind of thecopper corner: a bald-headed little executive named Hyacinth Secretan, who hadbuilt up the Société des Metaux into Europe’s largest manufacturer of gleamingbrass and copper goods. Closely attuned at all times to the copper market,Secretan traced the metal’s every flutter and dip. In late 1886, when one of histremendous orders for copper ingots had briefly elevated prices, MonsieurSecretan concluded the moment was propitious to quietly corner copper, drawingon lessons learned during a previous failed attempt to manipulate tin.So the foppish Secretan began contracting with the principal copper mines of theworld for their whole production (subject, of course, to restrictions) atthirteen cents a pound, a very nice profit for them. He then offered this copperon the world market at steadily escalating prices, hitting sixteen or seventeencents a pound by late 1887, a very nice profit for him. Monsieur Secretan hadlittle trouble signing up a host of European financial luminaries for his coppersyndicate, including the Rothschilds, Credit Lyonnaise, and the Comptoird’Escompt, France’s second-largest bank. Seeing swirling around them theproliferation of the copper-reliant electric light, trolley cars, and thetelegraph, all these financiers expected to ride the copper corner to evengreater fortunes. The world’s appetite for this metal could only grow.No one knew better than Thomas Edison the critical importance of copper’s cost.Not long after his fateful visit to William Wallace’s hissing arc lights arouseda great ambition to “get ahead of the other fellows” and light the world withincandescent light, Edison had seen what all others had been blind to.Drastically reducing copper use was the key to creating a practical incandescentlighting system, one that could compete financially with the coal-gasilluminating American cities. And Edison had, through his genius, lowered theamount of copper needed to a tiny fraction of original estimates. But in thewinter of 1887, the copper problem returned to harry Edison with a vengeance. Asthe Electrical Engineer noted by mid-February of 1888, “If the advance in theprice of copper proves to be more than temporary in its effect, one of itsincidental results will be to handicap seriously the low potential system ofelectrical distribution [Edison’s DC], in their efforts to compete commerciallywith the high potential systems of more recent introduction [Westinghouse’sAC].”12 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts12a]By early March of 1888, a month later, the Journal of Engineering and Mining wasreporting, “All the electrolitic copper in this country is now firmly in thegrasp of the syndicate. There appears, in fact, nothing to prevent prices frombeing advanced to any figure the syndicate may wish.”13[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts13a] This unfortunate and ominousturn of events was a real blow to the Edison Electric Light Company. Forinstance, in the spring of 1887, the company had been putting together a bid fora Minneapolis central station powering 21,700 lights. They estimated the feedersat 254,000 pounds of copper and the main at 51,680 pounds. At seventeen cents apound, copper costs would total $51,965. Each one-cent rise in copper pushedcosts up $3,056. A three-cent rise—for copper prices were escalatingsteadily—would add $9,000 to the almost $52,000 price tag for copper. In painfulcontrast, the new Westinghouse AC central plants required a third as muchcopper.Just as he was being squeezed by Westinghouse on one side and the rising priceof copper on the other, Edison was presented with an irresistible opportunityfor wreaking some sub-rosa vengeance on his new enemy. In early November of1887, Edison, America’s most revered electrician, had received a beautifullypenned letter from Dr. Alfred Southwick, a dour Buffalo dentist and one of threemembers of the New York State Death Commission. The commission’s task was tofind a civilized alternative to hanging for state prisoners condemned toexecution. The committee chairman was the rich New York attorney andphilanthropist Elbridge T. Gerry, best known for activism in the prevention ofcruelty to animals. The third member was Matthew Hale, an Albany politician.After a series of repellently botched state hangings, New York governor DavidHill had wondered if this “Dark Age” system might yield to something of a “lessbarbarous manner.”14 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts14a] All thenewspapers had described in revolting detail the state hangman’s scandalous andrepeated incompetence, whereby benighted criminals dangled in agony on too looseropes, gasping until slow-motion strangulation finally silenced their deathrattle. Or there was the equally gruesome but opposite problem: a noose soovertaut that it bloodily severed head from body before horrified officialwitnesses. In his letter to Edison, Dr. Southwick sought the inventor’s opinionon using electricity for electrocuting condemned criminals and also wondered ifhe could suggest “the necessary strength of current to produce death withcertainty in all cases and under all circumstances.”15[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts15a] Edison wrote back to Dr.Southwick declining to get involved, saying he opposed capital punishment. Thatwas in November.But Dr. Southwick was as hard pushing as his hometown of Buffalo. He was quiteadamant that clean and modern electrocution should prevail (having once seen aman keel over neatly dead in an electrical accident), and he wrote the nation’sforemost electrician again in early December. Appealing to Edison’s sense ofcivic duty, he pleaded, “Science and civilization demand some more humane methodthan the rope. The rope is a relic of barbarism and should be relegated to thepast.” These three commissioners of death—Dr. Southwick, politician Hale, andphilanthropist Gerry—had made a thorough study of the history of lethality,conducting a survey of the state’s judges, sheriffs, prosecutors, and physicianson the issue, and Dr. Southwick was pleased to report that eighty-seven of thetwo hundred responding favored electrocution. What the Buffalo dentist needednow was Edison and his enormous prestige “as an electrician” to persuade thelegislature.Tellingly, on December 9, 1887, Thomas Edison changed his mind and wrote Dr.Southwick again. But this time, the world’s most famous electrical wizard wasfull of very definite and very damaging opinions. The quickest, most painlessdeath, he asserted, “can be accomplished by the use of electricity, and the mostsuitable apparatus for the purpose is that class of dynamo-electric machinewhich employs intermittent currents. The most effective of those are known as‘alternating machines,’ manufactured principally in this country by Geo.Westinghouse…. The passage of the current from these machines through the humanbody even by the slightest contacts, produces instantaneous death.”16[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts16a] Was it the steadily rising priceof copper? Had Westinghouse just won yet another central station contract fromthe Edison camp? Was it that the gas companies were proving harder to dislodgethan anticipated, with their dropping prices and the much brighter gas mantlefor their lights? We can only speculate. Whatever the reason for this hostileact, Edison’s endorsement did the trick, and in mid-1888 the New York StateLegislature would establish electrocution—much to the outrage of (the rest of)the electrical fraternity—as the new means of capital punishment startingJanuary 1, 1889. Edison had just quietly (and secretly) planted something of alegislative land mine intended to damage his AC rivals.By February of 1888, Thomas Edison was no longer content to vent his rancor withsecret attacks. Using the vehicle of the Edison Electric Light Company, helashed out publicly, issuing what surely stands as America’s longest and mostsplenetic howl of corporate outrage. The eighty-four-page Edison diatribe,jacketed in angry scarlet and emblazoned with the title WARNING!, served as theofficial public salvo in one of the most unusual and caustic battles in Americancorporate history. Edison, with his DC system, was making his first open attackagainst Westinghouse and AC in the War of the Electric Currents. Thomas Edison,who had long (and reasonably) assumed that the electrical future was securelyhis—with all its glory and potential for riches—suddenly saw the famously tough,reckless, and industrially wealthy Westinghouse boldly swooping in fromPittsburgh to steal away his hard-earned prize. Edison would not sit backquietly and let what he saw as a dangerous system imperil not just his company,but the whole marvelous field of electricity.What had triggered this furious verbal assault from the Wizard of Menlo Park?Why did he launch the War of the Electric Currents then? Edison, not theintrospective sort, never did say. But we know that until 1885 Thomas Edison hadbeen too busy (and fully confident of market dominance) to even bother suing themany lesser companies infringing on his 1879 light bulb patent. He had dismissedand largely ignored his competitors as shameless imitators, “patent pirates” whostole his ideas and inventions but who posed little genuine threat. But by 1885,as other companies began hurting his business, Edison had finally unmuzzled histop-dollar lawyers. Certainly part of his rising bitterness toward thePittsburgh magnate was fueled by his anger at all infringers, for Westinghousewas among those making free use of an Edison-style bulb. Yet historian HaroldPasser explains that Edison competitors “seriously questioned the validity ofthe Edison lamp patents. The United States company [controlled by Westinghouse],for example, considered its patent position much stronger than Edison’s becauseit owned the incandescent-lamp patents of Farmer, Maxim, and Weston. Both Farmerand Maxim had worked in the incandescent lighting long before Edison.”17[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts17a] Westinghouse, ever a fighter,had further goaded Edison by filing a counter light bulb patent suit. Thus,however much the Edison attorneys might huff and puff in the courts, there wasstill at this point, says Passer, “reasonable doubt that the basic Edison [lightbulb] patent would be sustained. It is probable that few manufacturers and usersof incandescent lamps considered it a serious business risk to make and usethese lamps without permission from the Edison company.”18[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts18a]But angry as Edison was about light bulb infringers, George Westinghouse’sbiggest fault was daring to trespass at all on Edison’s electrical terrain. WhenThomas Edison first heard that the Pittsburgh industrialist was eyeingelectricity, he famously snapped, “Tell him to stick to air brakes.”19[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts19a] Not only had Westinghouse defiedEdison, he was selling something original, a power system that was new, not justa second-rate copy of the Edison system. While the first half of WARNING! wasdedicated to excoriating the light bulb infringers, much of the second halfassailed Westinghouse. The whole AC system was “the most uneconomical yetoffered to the public,” insisted the Edison people, once you factored in thegreater efficiency of DC generators, the reliable track record of the moretested DC systems, the lack of a meter to measure AC use, and the absence of anyAC motor.20 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts20a] The DC motorremained Edison’s great trump card. Those who preferred AC were dismissed as“Cheap Johns” and “the Apostles of Parsimony,” shysters foisting inferiorequipment on the unsuspecting.21 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts21a]Edison had no interest in acknowledging the great strength of the AC system—itsability to serve large areas and expand as needed.But Edison reserved his greatest fury for AC’s sheer dangers. Decreed theWARNING! booklet, “It is a matter of fact that any system employing highpressure, i.e. 500 to 2,000 units [volts], jeopardizes life.”22[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts22a] The Edison people warned that ifa transformer failed to step down the current, the whole building served wouldbe a possible death chamber reverberating with high-voltage electricity. ThomasEdison had always prided himself on his system’s safety: “There is no danger tolife, health, or person, in the current generated by any of the Edison dynamos”and “the wires at any part of the system, and even the poles of the generatoritself, may be grasped by the naked hand without the slightest effect.”23[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts23a] No other electrical company hadinvested such time and energy in devising safe insulation for its wires andcareful placement in the ground far away from the public as had Edison. Incontrast, Edison detailed in his WARNING! pamphlet the gruesome deaths byhigh-voltage AC of numerous AC workers. DC was a gentle, friendly current. ACwas a stone killer. Edison suggested the AC people were criminally indifferentto safety just to save a buck and get ahead.Edison’s rancorous corporate diatribe culminated by rallying the electricaltroops to rise up against the infidels of AC: “All electricians who believe inthe future of electricity ought to unite in a war of extermination againstcheapness in applied electricity, wherever they see that it involvesinefficiency and danger.” Edison humbly volunteered to serve as the moralcompass in this holy war. Those, like George Westinghouse, who dared to forgeahead on an alternate and alternating path, however shimmering and promising,were now the official enemy, the besmirchers of the sacred ways. GeorgeWestinghouse is, they sneered, “the inventor of the vaunted system ofdistribution which is to-day recognized by every thoroughly-read electrician asonly an ignis fatuus, in following which the Pittsburg company have at everystep sunk deeper in the quagmire of disappointment.”24[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts24a] The first open, public shots hadnow been fired toward Pittsburgh in the War of the Electric Currents.In the spring of 1888, even as the papers began to track every instance of“electrocution by wire” and the Edison Electric Light Company had made known itsire with AC, the small world of New York electricians began to buzz with rumorsabout the former Edison man Nikola Tesla. He was said to have reappeared and tobe up to something big down on Liberty Street, filing a steady stream of patentsrelated to an AC system. And indeed Nikola Tesla had been wonderfullyproductive, churning out one new AC machine after another. To handle all thework, he had summoned from Europe his old school chum and fellow engineerAnthony Szigety, who had sailed into the choppy waters of New York Harbor on May10, 1887, to the rousing sight of Auguste Bartholdi’s long-aborning Statue ofLiberty. For six months now, the monumental goddess had been gleaming forththrough each gray dawn, her torch of enlightenment radiantly lit from within byelectricity and her bronze robes and grave face aglow from the thousands ofcandlepower at her feet. This luminous figure of welcome had been dedicated theprevious winter with festive fanfare, after working-class readers of the NewYork World had sent in their pennies and dimes, showing the nation that ordinarypeople—not millionaires—would be the ones to finally erect the majesticsculpture on her Bedloe’s Island pedestal. And so, emerging from Castle Gardento see the greensward of Battery Park, crisscrossed by shaded gravel paths andso wonderfully cooled by the harbor breezes, Szigety was reunited with his oldfriend Tesla. The two were soon putting in intense all-night hours constructingnumerous variants on the AC induction motor Tesla had drawn for him in the sandsof the Budapest park.Years later, Tesla’s first biographer, science writer John O’Neill, would recallhow proud Tesla had been about the integrity of his vision. “When the machineswere physically constructed not one of them failed to operate as he hadanticipated…. Years had elapsed since he evolved the designs. In the meantime hehad not committed a line to paper—yet he had remembered perfectly every lastdetail.”25 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts25a] The rest of 1887 wasa frenzy of creativity and secret construction as Tesla and his helpers turnedout all the necessary components for three complete AC systems—single-phasealternating current, two-phase, and three-phase. He designed and built copperand iron models for each system—a dynamo (without the commutator!) thatgenerated the electric current, an induction motor with its rotating magneticcore (again no commutators) to produce power, and then transformers to step upand step down that power. At the end of a whirlwind six months, Tesla had in hislaboratory a whole system based on polyphase AC. On October 12, 1887, Teslasubmitted an omnibus patent application, but the patent office requested it bebroken down further. In November and December, Tesla filed for the first of whatwould eventually be forty patents covering the whole range of his AC system withits revolutionary induction motor. He was perfecting his AC system even as hisold boss was denouncing AC to the world.The ambitious young editor of Electrical World, Thomas Commerford Martin, apersonable and ambitious bald English immigrant who sported a giant mustachio,stopped by Tesla’s lab. He quickly grasped that this little-known but highlycharming Serb was going to be the next electrical titan, a visionary whoseradiant dreams rivaled Edison’s. As a journalist, Martin savored the furtherdrama that the unknown Tesla’s electrical dreams clashed with those of theworld-famous Edison—AC versus DC. Tesla, just thirty-one, was as much a truehumanist as ever, seeking to ease the hard labor of the whole world with hisspectacular induction motor and alternating current system. What AC had lackedup until now was a workable motor that it could power (although many awell-placed inventor was struggling to solve that puzzle and cover himself inglory). Now here was Nikola Tesla, a little-known electrician of minoraccomplishment, seizing that prize.Thomas Commerford Martin appreciated immediately the epochal nature of Tesla’sAC motor and polyphase system and began considering how best he could shepherdthis new genius to certain fame and millions of dollars. Martin was,fortunately, in a uniquely influential position. Not only was he the editor ofthe electrical field’s top American journal, he was also the current presidentof the prestigious American Institute of Electrical Engineers (an organizationall of four years old). He was therefore well versed in the feuds and cutthroatrivalries of the electrical universe and knew how best to introduce such a largeand brilliant star into its heavens at such a delicate and stormy moment. Martindeparted Tesla’s Liberty Street lab in a great thrill of excitement, planninghis campaign to launch Nikola Tesla. The English editor’s first task was to getothers equally enthralled with Tesla’s system.First, the AC polyphase machines needed to be tested and their revolutionarynature acknowledged by an outside expert of high standing. Martin arranged forProfessor William Anthony, an eminent academic of electrical engineering atCornell University, to come to Liberty Street and meet Tesla and his machines.Then machines were sent to him and several others for further testing. In Marchof 1888, Professor Anthony excitedly wrote a friend that he “was shown themachines under pledge of secrecy as applications were still in the PatentOffice…. I have seen an armature weighing 12 pounds running at 3,000, when oneof the (ac) circuits was suddenly reversed, reverse its rotation so suddenly Icould hardly see what did it. In all this you understand there is no commutator.The armatures have no connection with anything outside…. It was a wonderfulresult to me … in the form of motor I first described, there is absolutelynothing like a commutator, the two (ac) chasing each other round the field do itall. There is nothing to wear except the two bearings.”26[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts26a] So, just as Martin hoped,Tesla’s name and riveting invention were filtering out among the people whomattered. Professor Anthony, a completely disinterested party, had judgedTesla’s motors the equal in efficiency of existing direct current models.Now Martin recommended to Tesla that he prepare a lecture to establish himselfbefore the electrical world. Tesla demurred. When the first seven of Tesla’sfourteen foundation patents were granted May 1, 1888, Martin again urged theSerbian inventor to make formally known to his electrical peers his magnificentbreakthrough. Again Tesla excused himself politely, pleading exhaustion from thetremendous exertion of designing and constructing his whole complex system soswiftly. Professor Anthony then joined T. C. Martin in pressing Tesla to speakas soon as possible. Franklin Pope, editor of the Electrical Engineer and aWestinghouse engineer and patent attorney, had also been invited to LibertyStreet, and he added his voice. Some years later, Martin would write that he“had great difficulty in inducing Mr. Tesla to give the Institute any paper atall. Mr. Tesla was overworked and ill, and manifested the greatest reluctance toan exhibition of his motors, but his objections were at last overcome. The paperwas written the night previous to the meeting, in pencil, very hastily, andunder the pressure just mentioned.”27[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts27a] Martin brushed aside Tesla’sworries about discussing aspects of his system for which he had not yet evenfiled patents. Nikola Tesla needed to establish his preeminence in this field.So on the cool Tuesday evening of May 15, Tesla traveled up to Columbia Collegeon Madison and 47th Street, where the American Institute of Electrical Engineerswas convening.The meeting that evening commenced with various laudatory remarks celebratingMartin’s energetic term as president. Then Nikola Tesla, tall, slender, his hairparted in the middle above a wide forehead, stood before the assembledelectricians, a sea of men attired in high hats and dark frock coats, the crowdinterspersed with the occasional interested lady. Tesla, with his highcheekbones, looked like a foreign, somewhat eccentric aristocrat in hispreferred swallowtail coat. Speaking in his excellent but accented English, hefirst thanked his benefactors, Professor Anthony and Mr. Martin and Mr. Pope,men any ambitious electrician would wish as patrons. Then he excused his wan andweary appearance and the inadequacy of his presentation. “The notice,” he saidin his high voice, “was rather short, and I have not been able to treat thesubject so extensively as I could have desired, my health not being in the bestcondition at present. I ask your kind indulgence, and I shall be very muchgratified if the little I have done meets your approval.”Standing behind his shiny AC induction motors, Tesla began his talk, making hispoint by starting and stopping the machines and showing through drawings anddiagrams also how they worked. “The subject which I have the pleasure ofbringing to your notice is a novel system of electrical distribution andtransmission of power by means of alternate currents, affording peculiaradvantages, particularly in the way of motors, which I am confident will at onceestablish the superior adaptability of these currents to the transmission ofpower and will show that many results heretofore unattainable can be reached bytheir use; results which are very much desired in the practical operation ofsuch systems, and which cannot be accomplished by means of continuouscurrents.”28 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts28a] Tesla went on totell all present that what they took quite for granted—the presence ofcommutators and brushes on existing motors to redirect the naturally producedalternating current into direct current when it entered the machine—would fromhere on in be unnecessary. He had invented a motor that was like no other, onethat operated in a system expressly designed for it by him. Consequently, fromthis time forward, “alternate currents would commend themselves as a more directapplication of electrical energy.”29[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts29a]Scientist and Tesla biographer Robert Lomas notes that others who came beforeTesla found that the magnetic fields produced by alternating current enteredmotors and “just churned about, not turning the motor. What Tesla did, was touse two alternating currents that were out of step with each other [polyphase].Like the propelling waves of legs that move a millipede forward, the magneticfields worked together to push the rotating shaft of the motor around. By usingmore than one set of currents, he could ensure that there was always a strongcurrent available to power the motor. As one of the currents died away, theother would continue to move the motor round. The magnetic field rotated andcarried the motor round with it, and it did so without using any electricalconnections to the rotating shaft.”30[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts30a]After Tesla delivered his lecture, Martin stepped forward to propose that thedistinguished Professor William Anthony say a few words. The professor, in turn,bestowed his prestigious blessing on this brilliant Serb’s astonishing newmotor: “I confess that on first seeing the motors the action seemed to me anexceedingly remarkable one.” He briefly discussed the technical advantages—fewwearing parts—and the motor’s efficiency. Then the well-known electricalinventor Elihu Thomson, whose fast-growing firm Thomson-Houston had also enteredthe AC central station business six months earlier in the fall of 1887, stoodup. Thomson, a tall man with deep-set eyes and a thick brush mustache, wasnot—like Edison, Westinghouse, or Tesla—an inventor who had created original andpathbreaking technologies. But he was immensely skillful at improving and makingcommercially viable the work of the field’s pioneers. Thomson-Houston, seeingthe demand for Westinghouse AC systems, had begun offering their own line ofcentral stations, prompting an outraged George Westinghouse to swiftly sue themfor infringing on his Gaulard-Gibbs patents. Within a couple of months, the twocompanies reached terms, with Thomson-Houston agreeing to pay a$2-per-horsepower royalty on each transformer it produced. (About the same time,Hiram Maxim’s old firm, United States Electric, also began selling AC centralsystems. The Westinghouse response to this infringement was so bellicose, U.S.Electric opted instead to let itself be bought by the flourishing Westinghouseelectrical empire.)When Professor Thomson stood up after the Columbia College AC talk, hecomplimented Mr. Tesla on “his new and admirable little motor.” But what Thomsonreally wished to establish was that he, too, had been working on an AC motor. “Ihave, as probably you may be aware, worked in somewhat similar directions andtowards the attainment of similar ends. The trials which I have made have beenby the use of a single alternating current circuit—not a double alternatingcurrent—a single current supplying a motor constructed to utilize thealternation and produce rotation.”31[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts31a] However, Thomson’s AC motordepended—as had all others attempted up to this time—upon that troublesomeobject the commutator. Tesla understood exactly what Thomson was trying todo—establish precedence. He gracefully parried the challenge, declaring himselfflattered to be noticed by someone as eminent as Professor Thomson, “beingforemost in his profession.” Tesla was highly deferential, acknowledging, “I hada motor identically the same as that of Professor Thomson, but I was anticipatedby him.”But he also honestly suggested that Thomson would be hard put to claim any kindof equality or anticipation here. Tesla pointed out that Thomson’s “peculiarform of motor represents the disadvantage that a pair of brushes must beemployed to short circuit the armature coil.”32[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts32a] Tesla had thought briefly alongThomson’s lines but had soared forward, eliminating the commutators with hiscompletely original solution—magnetic fields continuously pushing round themotor’s core. Martin deftly cut off discussion while Tesla held the advantage.But this bristly public exchange marked the start of a lifelong antipathy. AsNikola Tesla returned to his seat, the assembled electricians comprehendeduneasily and somewhat resentfully that a new titan had risen unbidden amongthem, eclipsing much of what they had done, making irrelevant many of theirdearest labors. His name was Nikola Tesla, and the ambitious and influentialThomas Commerford Martin was his prophet.Tesla’s first lecture, “A New System of Alternate Current Motors andTransformers,” was all Martin could have hoped, catapulting Tesla to instantfame in the engineering world. This paper, printed in all the foremostengineering journals, quickly became a landmark for its lucid description of anentirely new kind of very simple “induction” motor. Engineers and the press wereastonished at the originality, simplicity, and promise of his AC design. Edisonviewed it as but a variant on a technology that was unsafe and unfit for use inhuman habitations.It is likely that George Westinghouse had learned about Tesla’s revolutionaryrotating motors and AC system before the Serb inventor made his dazzling publicdebut in mid-May before the engineers. After all, Franklin Pope, editor of theElectrical Engineer and a Westinghouse employee, had visited the Liberty Streetlab at Martin’s behest. But it was not until Westinghouse read Tesla’s landmarklecture that he took action. He quickly dispatched H. M. Byllesby, a onetimeEdison engineer lured away to become a Westinghouse vice president, to visitNikola Tesla in Manhattan and see if the now famous motors merited such huzzahs.On May 21, 1888, Byllesby wrote his boss that he had met up with Tesla’sbackers, engineer Alfred S. Brown and lawyer Charles Peck, and then proceeded tothe Liberty Street lab with them. There he had met Tesla and witnessed severaldemonstrations, all of which, he admitted, were somewhat over his head. “His[Tesla’s] description was not of a nature which I was enabled, entirely, tocomprehend. However, I saw several points which I think are of interest. In thefirst place, as near as I can get it, the underlying principle of this motor isthe principle which Mr. Shallenberger is at work at this present moment. Themotors, as far as I can judge from the examination which I was enabled to make,are a success. They start from rest and the reversion of the direction ofrotation can be suddenly accomplished without any short-circuiting.”33[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts33a]After the demonstration, Byllesby and his escorts returned to Alfred Brown’soffice to talk business. The Westinghouse executive inquired about thepossibility of purchasing the patents. He learned they were held by the TeslaElectric Company and that already Peck and Brown had an offer from a SanFrancisco capitalist of $200,000 plus $2.50 per horsepower on all apparatus.Reportedly, Cornell professor William Anthony was joining this syndicate. IfWestinghouse intended to match or better this offer, they needed to know byFriday at the latest. Byllesby was aghast. He wrote the home office, “The terms,of course, are monstrous; and I so told them…. I told them there was nopossibility of our considering the matter seriously but that I would let themknow before Friday…. In order to avoid giving the impression that the matter wasone which excited my curiosity I made my visit short.”34[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts34a]It’s not clear if Peck and Brown really did have such a lucrative offer, for aweek later, they were willing to grant Byllesby a $5,000 option for six weeks.George Westinghouse began seriously consulting with his in-house engineers andpatent experts. What Tesla and his partners did not know was that a Westinghouserepresentative—the peripatetic Guido Pantaleoni—was once again in Europe on anAC mission, this time seeking to buy an AC motor patent from his Italianengineering professor, Galileo Ferraris. A month before Tesla’s talk before theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers, even as Tesla’s patents were beingconsidered at the U.S. Patent Office, Professor Ferraris of Turin had given alecture laying out his own version of an alternating current motor. There was,however, a monumental difference between Tesla and Ferraris, and that was thatthe Italian electrician viewed his effort purely as a tantalizing and amusingtoy, while Tesla had designed a machine and system intended for heavy-dutycommercial work. Martin had been properly impatient that Tesla declare his greatdiscovery in a high-profile way, for others were indeed working away on thedilemma. With AC systems spreading across Europe and America, the pressing needfor a working motor had become more than well-known. Among engineers, AC motorswere in the air. Mere weeks before Tesla’s talk, Westinghouse engineer OliverShallenberger had solved one of the outstanding gaps in the company’s AClighting system, the lack of a meter to measure electrical use. That meter wasalso based on the rotating effects of out-of-phase currents, and Shallenbergerhad begun to experiment with a possible motor. While Westinghouse continued tosurvey the general status of AC motors, he instructed Pantaleoni to buy theFerraris patent for the small sum of $1,000.The wiry William Stanley would complain later in life (when George Westinghousewas dead and gone) that Westinghouse never really appreciated the possibilitiesof alternating current in the pioneering days and never compensated him fairly.Now, in the wake of Tesla’s triumph, Stanley claimed to his boss that he,Stanley, had already invented an AC motor. “I have built an AC system onbasically the same principle,” he said. However, like Elihu Thomson, Stanley wasoverlooking the inconvenient fact that his AC motor was still using commutatorsand brushes. Only Nikola Tesla had designed an AC induction motor free of thosetroublesome, sparking objects. On July 5, 1888, Westinghouse, his option runningout, wrote to one of his lawyers and partners, “I have been thinking over thismotor question very considerably, and am of the opinion that if Tesla has anumber of applications pending in the patent office, he will be able to coverbroadly the apparatus that Shallenberger was experimenting with and that Stanleythought he had invented. It is more than likely that he will be able to carryhis date of invention back sufficient time to seriously interfere with Ferrarisand that our investment there will probably prove a bad one.“If the Tesla patents are broad enough to control the alternating motorbusiness, then the Westinghouse Electric Company cannot afford to have othersown the patents.”35 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts35a] Early hopesof using the Ferraris patents as leverage now evaporated, and the Westinghousepeople simply had to go along with what Brown and Peck were asking, which was,in fact, far less than the original $200,000. They sought and received $20,000in cash and $50,000 in notes (payable in three installments), plus the $2.50royalty per horsepower on every AC Tesla motor, with $5,000 minimum paid inroyalties the first year, $10,000 the second, and $15,000 the third.Westinghouse was his usual phlegmatic and pragmatic self: “With reference to theTesla motor patents, the price to be paid seems rather high when coupled withall of the other terms and conditions, but if it is the only practicable methodfor operating a motor by the alternating current, and if it is applicable tostreet car work, we can unquestionably easily get from the users of theapparatus whatever tax is put upon it by the inventors.”36[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts36a]Even if the California offer was real, the Tesla Electric Company partners mayhave preferred to sell to George Westinghouse. In an era of robber barons,Westinghouse had developed a reputation as a fair but indomitable, no-nonsensebusinessman who defended his patents ferociously. He had already suedThomson-Houston over his transformer and forced them to make a royalty deal. Andhe had simply bought up United States Electric when they dared to trespass. Inthe sharklike atmosphere of Gilded Age capitalism, Nikola Tesla and his partnerswell knew that they needed such a fearless fighter if they were ever to see morethan three years of royalties. Tesla very much admired Westinghouse’s qualitiesas a businessman. He said once, “No fiercer adversary than Westinghouse couldhave been found when he was aroused. An athlete in ordinary life, he wastransformed into a giant when confronted with difficulties which seemedinsurmountable. When others would give up in despair he triumphed. Had he beentransferred to another planet with everything against him he would have workedout his salvation.”37 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts37a]Nor could Tesla and his investors overlook, as they considered their options,the overt hostility of Thomas Edison toward AC. The War of the Electric Currentswas only likely to escalate as the stakes rose, and Tesla’s much needed AC motorput him squarely in the enemy camp. That being so, Tesla would later say thatGeorge Westinghouse was “in my opinion, the only man on this globe who couldtake my alternating system under the circumstances then existing and win thebattle against prejudice and money power. He was a pioneer of imposing stature,one of the world’s noblemen.”38 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts38a]Tesla, who had little trouble envisioning that the whole world would soon beoperating on millions of AC-generated horsepower, viewed the deal for hispatents as quite fair, even if he had to give five-ninths to his partners. LikeEdison, Tesla wanted great wealth not for itself, but so he would be completelyfree to think, invent, and develop his ideas. The ardent idealist, he sawhimself as finally bestowing his great gift on the world. Years earlier, when hehad first conceived of the whirling magnetic field, he declared to the doubtingSzigety, “No more will men be slaves to hard tasks. My motor will set them free,it will do the work of the world.”Thus, in late July 1888, Nikola Tesla quit the heat of Manhattan, ferried acrossthe breezy Hudson, and boarded the comfortable cars of the Pennsylvania Railroadfor the ten-hour journey to Pittsburgh, where he had agreed to serve as aWestinghouse consultant. By bestowing his new all-important AC induction motorupon George Westinghouse’s rapidly expanding electrical empire, Tesla waseliminating the one great remaining advantage of Edison’s DC system. The War ofthe Electric Currents was about to be joined in earnest."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_016_r1.jpg]Thomas Edison at his desk dictating into the Edison Business PhonographCHAPTER 7“Constant Danger from Sudden Death”On the warm late afternoon of Tuesday, June 5, 1888, weary New York Citycommuters ascended to the downtown elevated station as newsboys bellowed outtheir best headlines of murder, mayhem, and politics. Yet only those riders whopurchased the venerable New York Evening Post to read for their trek back homewould have seen a long, fevered, and highly bellicose letter to the editortitled “Death in the Wires.” The letter began, “The death of the poor boyStreiffer, who touched a straggling telegraph wire on East Broadway on April 15,and was instantly killed, is closely followed by the death of Mr. Witte in frontof 200 Bowery and of William Murray at 616 Broadway on May 11, and any day mayadd new victims to the list.”The letter writer, one Harold P. Brown, denounced the wretched deadly spiderwebsof thousands of electric wires strung haphazardly above the city’s busieststreets. But Brown wished not simply to castigate the officials for thewell-known dangers of unsafe wires, but to thunder of new perils. “Severalcompanies who have more regard for the almighty dollar than for the safety ofthe public, have adopted the ‘alternating’ current for incandescent service. Ifthe pulsating [arc] current is ‘dangerous,’ then the ‘alternating’ current canbe described by no adjective less forcible than damnable.” Declared Brown, “Theonly excuse for the use of the fatal ‘alternating’ current is that it saves thecompany operating it from spending a larger sum of money for the heavier copperwires, which are required by the safe incandescent systems. That is the publicmust submit to constant danger from sudden death in order that a corporation maypay a little larger dividend.” He called for the outlawing of all AC above 300volts to “prevent the wholesale risk of human life.” (It was perhaps notimmaterial that the Evening Post was owned by longtime Edison investor HenryVillard, soon to be Edison president.) Suddenly, the War of the ElectricCurrents had been moved onto far more dangerous, high-stakes terrain. Brown wasseeking not to dissuade potential customers, but to outlaw outright AC.Who was this Harold Brown? Until that Tuesday, he was a thoroughly obscure NewYork engineer and electrical consultant, a complete nobody. At the time hecomposed his denunciatory letter to the Post, Brown described himself on hisprofessional stationery as an electrical engineer, designer of apparatus forspecial purposes, contractor for arc and incandescent electric lights and steampower, and creator of life-protecting apparatus for arc light dynamos. Now, onJune 5, 1888, he had suddenly charged forth against AC. What prompted Brown’swrathful attack remains something of a mystery, despite extensive probings bynumerous historians. He had no apparent ties at this stage to the Edison camp.Nor did he bear any discernible personal or professional vendetta or grudgeagainst members of the AC group, including Westinghouse. Perhaps it was simplythat this little-known member of the New York electrical fraternity saw a goldenopportunity for fame and glory as the aggrieved voice of the gathering anti-ACcrusaders. Until now, the Edison forces had contented themselves with writtenvituperation and proxies arguing against patronizing AC in genteel forums likethe Chicago Electric Club. Suddenly, with Harold Brown, they had a man ofaction, an enraged fighter who would lead the public charge in the anti-AC holywar.Nor was Brown a mere blowhard. His strident urging of a swift legislative end tohigh potentials—“No alternating current with a higher electromotive force than300 volts shall be used”—would indeed put the AC men out of business. He swiftlyseized new and strategic ground: The famously dilatory New York City Board ofElectrical Control convened days later on Friday, June 8, another warm andlovely late spring day, and Brown himself appeared, a young and ratherharmless-looking fellow, his dark hair parted neatly to one side and a tamehandlebar mustache highlighting a biggish nose. Yet when Brown spoke he was verymuch the firebrand, insisting his now notorious letter be read verbatim into therecord. His proposed safety rules were to be published in the minutes and markedcopies sent for comment to an array of eminent electric companies andelectricians, including George Westinghouse. Events had now escalated beyondangry phrasemaking to bellicose and economically threatening efforts tolegislate AC out of existence.Many hours west in Pittsburgh, where the summer heat and humidity concentratedthe city’s famous grime and soot into an unhealthful black celestial umbrella,Brown’s main target, George Westinghouse, was biding his time. He put offanswering the New York City Board of Electrical Control’s request for comment.Instead, on June 7 he sat in his large office with its lovely Persian rug andwrote a personal note to Thomas Edison in West Orange, in part about rumors ofmergers between their two companies. But his main purpose was to propose peace:“I believe there has been a systematic attempt on the part of some people to doa great deal of mischief and create as great a difference as possible betweenthe Edison Company and The Westinghouse Electric Co., when there ought to be anentirely different condition of affairs.“I have a lively recollection of the pains that you took to show me through yourworks at Menlo Park when I was in pursuit of a plant for my house, and beforeyou were ready for business, and also of my meeting you once afterwards atBergman’s factory; and it would be a pleasure to me if you should find itconvenient to make me a visit here in Pittsburgh when I will be glad toreciprocate the attention shown me by you.”1[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts1a] Edison responded in anoncommittal fashion on June 12: “My laboratory work consumes the whole of mytime…. Thanking you for your kind invitation to visit you in Pittsburg.”2[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts2a] And that was all. Not long after,Edison’s sales force began accusing their Westinghouse rivals of lying about ACadvantages, a tactic that so infuriated Westinghouse, he briefly consideredsuing.His olive branch rebuffed, George Westinghouse was heard from publicly for thefirst time when the New York City Board of Electrical Control reconvened atWallack’s Theater on Monday, July 16. Unlike Thomas Edison, who at this pointoperated quietly behind the scenes, George Westinghouse hid behind no one.Certainly, by mid-July of 1888, he had no further illusions. Thomas Edison andhis company were serious about their holy war against AC. The time had come tostrike back. So Westinghouse’s letter to the New York City Board of ElectricalControl was a skillful, hard-hitting piece of PR. First, he excused his tardyresponse by pleading the tremendous press of business. In less than two years,his company and its licensee Thomson-Houston had installed 127 AC stations, 98of which were up and operating already. Of those 98 AC plants, a third hadalready expanded. The plant in Pittsburgh was the “largest incandescent lightingstation in the world.” With so much business, explained Westinghouse, “it hasbeen considered inexpedient, heretofore, to take any notice of, or make anyreply to, the criticisms and attacks of some of the opposition electric lightingcompanies.”Westinghouse, a corporate titan well seasoned in the most cutthroat of GildedAge business warfare, declared himself amazed at a “method of attack which hasbeen more unmanly, discreditable and untruthful than any competition which hasever come to my knowledge.” If they wanted to fight a dirty war, Westinghousecould lob his own incendiary devices. Was the issue safety? Well, not oneWestinghouse central station had sustained “a single case of fire of anydescription from the use of our system. Of the 125 central stations of theleading direct current company [Edison] there are numerous cases of fire, inthree of which cases the central station itself was entirely destroyed, the mostrecent being the destruction of the Boston station; while among the almostinnumerable fires caused by this system, among the users, may be mentioned thetotal destruction of a large theater at Philadelphia.”An octet of pro-AC affidavits had also fluttered into the quiet offices of theelectrical control board in the preceding weeks, and these were now duly readaloud at Wallack’s Theater. All followed along the lines of one fromPhiladelphia, wherein an electrical worker named W. L. Wright described hisinconsequent encounter with the supposedly fatal AC current. Working on somewires in a damp basement, read his testimonial, and forgetting that a 1,000-voltcurrent was active in it, “I took hold of the socket while standing on the wetground, when I received a shock which threw me on my face with my handunderneath me, and still handling the socket…. When I came to my senses I wassitting in the cellar held up by two of the men. In the meantime, an ambulancehad been called. I went down to the electric light station and waited there forfifteen or twenty minutes to receive my money; it being pay-day, and then wenthome.” The company insisted he visit a doctor, who dressed his burned hand.“These burns healed very slowly; but I have not felt in any way any of the aftereffects from this shock, such as are usually felt from high tension directcurrent machines…. I feel sure that had I received this kind of shock from adirect current machine of any of the ordinary types … it would have beenfatal.”3 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts3a]Harold Brown was not present at the Wallack’s Theater meeting, beingconveniently away in Virginia on business. This was probably just as well, forthe opposition forces were in a highly hostile mood, questioning everything fromHarold Brown’s fitness and training as an electrician to his motives. Where, hiscritics reasonably demanded, was Brown’s proof? On what basis was he urging thattheir electrical enterprises be banned?Brown had catapulted from utter obscurity in two brief weeks to become theself-appointed, impassioned champion of one of America’s most reveredicons—Thomas Alva Edison. What must Edison have thought when he read Brown’spassionate diatribe against Edison’s own most hated enemies? We do not know, butthe beleaguered and indignant Brown tells us he was determined to prove his caseand so called upon Edison, “whom I had never met before, and asked the loan ofinstruments…. To my surprise, Mr. Edison at once invited me to make experimentsat his private laboratory, and placed all necessary apparatus at my disposal.”4[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts4a] (Brown was probably the onlyelectrician in Gotham surprised by Edison’s hearty embrace of his mission.) Fromthis moment forth, Edison eagerly aided and abetted this self-appointed crusaderagainst the “damnable current,” a man whose stated goal was the legislative endto Edison’s biggest rivals, the AC companies. Brown needed to respond to hiscritics, he said. He needed to prove his case. Edison offered Brown not justspace in his extraordinary new laboratory, but the help of his most trustedlieutenants, Charles Batchelor and newly hired British scientist ArthurKennelly, son of the Bombay harbormaster and future eminent professor at MIT andHarvard.Edison’s new laboratory had been built over in New Jersey on ten acres just halfa mile down the hill from his new estate, Glenmont, in the quiet valley of WestOrange. Edison had been a widower briefly before becoming engaged to the youngand lovely Mina Miller. He and Mina had first gone to see the sprawling QueenAnne–style château Glenmont in December of 1885. On a cold wintry day they hadcrossed the Hudson River and then driven out to the snow-covered garden suburbof Llewelyn Park. There they inspected the brick-and-wood mansion’s many gables,admired the vast entry hall and glittering chandeliers, the broad curvingstaircases, gleaming wood floors, rich stained-glass windows, and palatialliving rooms and marveled that it was all lavishly and conveniently furnished,including walls bedecked with oil paintings and niches filled with statuary.Outside, the rolling grounds white with the recent snowfall boasted numerousgreenhouses and dormant flower beds certain to be beautiful come spring andsummer. Built for $235,000, Glenmont was on the market for a bargain $50,000.(The original New York millionaire owner had been caught embezzling from hisfirm, the Arnold Constable department store, and had fled overseas.) The lovelyMina thought it a fittingly opulent new home for the nation’s greatest inventor,and Edison was anxious to please her.Charles Batchelor then supervised both the purchase of nearby land for Edison’snew laboratory and its construction. Edison’s up-to-the-minute inventionfactory, ten times larger than ramshackle Menlo Park, included a vast andgraceful central building with sixty thousand square feet, housing a machineshop, glassblowing, chemical, and photographic departments, electrical testingrooms, and stockrooms. Here Edison put his stately wood-paneled office andlibrary, his huge rolltop desk arranged just below a two-story gallery that heldten thousand scientific volumes. No longer so given to playing the hick, Edisonappreciated the importance of impressing his multitudes of visitors. A quartetof other buildings provided further space. The laboratory was stocked with“eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size ofneedle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits,goat, minx, camel.” Edison, ever the kidder, told one reporter he “orderedeverything from an elephant’s hide to the eyeballs of a United States Senator.”5[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts5a]Edison’s early ambitions of being far more than an inventor were undimmed. Heyearned to succeed as an industrial titan. And he had come to see fromdeveloping his electrical networks the commercial advantages of a well-stocked,well-financed laboratory that could quickly parlay ideas into products. It washere, in quiet West Orange, an hour by ferry and train from noisy, dirty,moneyed Manhattan, that the energetic and eager Brown set himself to provingduring numerous late night experiments in Thomas Edison’s state-of-the-artfacility that AC was truly the “damnable” current, one that should be madeillegal.By late July, Harold Brown felt prepared to confront his critics with the kindof definitive scientific evidence they had been clamoring for. Engravedinvitations went forth to the members of the New York City Board of ElectricalControl, representatives of all the electric light companies, and numerousothers in the electrical fraternity, inviting one and all up to Madison Avenueand 50th Street for a demonstration in “Prof. Chandler’s Lecture Room at theSchool of Mines, Columbia College,” on Monday, July 30.6[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts6a] The day was warm, butseventy-five electrical gentlemen and numerous reporters gathered in the large,airy college lecture room with a sense of delightful anticipation, for Brown hadalready shown that he was a lively sort not likely to turn the other cheek. “Nointimation of the character of the exhibition had been given,” noted onejournal. How would he make his case?Brown, his hair neat and glossy, his mustache trim, began by saying that “he hadbeen drawn into the controversy by his sense of right. He represented no companyand no financial or commercial interest.” He then discussed the differencesbetween the alternating and the continuous current and stated he had proved “byrepeated experiments that a living creature could stand shocks from a continuouscurrent much better.”7 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts7a] This wouldexplain the large wooden cage with copper wires interlaced between the bars. Atthis point, Brown vanished for a moment into a side room and then reappeared,leading a large black retriever dog. After muzzling the animal, he put him inthe large cage, strapped him into place, and locked the cage door. The crowd ofmen holding their straw hats and light-colored derbies stirred and murmured.Brown said that the dog, which looked quite a brute, was in perfect health butof vicious disposition. He weighed seventy-six pounds. The dog woofed throughhis muzzle.Arthur Kennelly, the Edison chief electrician, served as Brown’s assistant, asdid Dr. Frederick Peterson, a doctor who specialized in treating patients withelectricity, and a few others. They were needed to hold the struggling black dogas wires were attached to the furry right foreleg and left back leg, each beingalready wrapped with some waterlogged material. The dog’s “resistance” was foundto be 15,300 ohms. Harold Brown began by applying 300 volts of DC. The dogseemed startled and unhappy. When the power was upped to 400 volts of DC, thelarge black creature struggled and yelped pitiably inside his cage. The crowd ofmen shifted in their seats, and there were audible murmurs of disapproval in thelecture hall growing warm with summer heat and bodies. At 700 volts DC, thedog’s violent thrashings broke the restraints and he had to be restrapped.Brown ignored the rising feeling against his cruel display and increased thevoltage to 1,000. “Many of the spectators left the room,” reported one journal,“unable to endure the revolting exhibition.”8[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts8a] The poor beast contorted in pain,and some in the audience began loudly telling Brown to cease. At this juncture,Brown turned off the direct current. He told his restive audience, “He will haveless trouble when we try the alternating current. As these gentlemen say, weshall make him feel better.” A Siemens Brothers alternator was hooked up, and330 volts of AC was administered to the quivering and terrified retriever, whichquickly collapsed in a horrible heap, dead. At that moment, a reporter for theNew York World stood up. He fiercely protested any further such torturing ofdogs, which emboldened an agent for the American Society for the Prevention ofCruelty to Animals (ASPCA) to step forward and forbid Brown from executinganother dog. Seeing how the audience had grown hostile rather than enlightened,Brown stopped.The shaken electricians stood up, put on their hats, and began to disperseunhappily from the lecture hall. Despite Brown’s assertion that he had nowprovided the demanded proof, few in the audience concurred, for the blackretriever had obviously been much weakened by his initial electrical torturewith DC before he received the killing zap of AC. Brown bitterly resented beingthwarted from quickly killing a dog with straight AC. He blamed the “treachery”of the AC forces. He reassured the departing audience that he had many otherdogs and had experimented on enough in the past month to be quite certain ofAC’s superior fatalness. Harold Brown’s final remark as the demonstration endedwas that “the only places where an alternating current ought to be used were thedog pound, the slaughter house, and the state prison.”9[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts9a]This electrical dog show was what Brown had been preparing for all thoseunusually cool July nights across the river at West Orange. He had gathered hisdogs by paying a twenty-five-cent bounty to local children. Kennelly and CharlesBatchelor had frequently helped out. The latter had been severely shockedhimself when holding down a puppy. He felt “body and soul being wrenched asunder… the sensations of an immense rough file thrust through the quivering fibers ofthe body.”10 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts10a] Brown learned thathe could kill a dog with only 300 volts of AC, but with DC he needed 1,000volts.Four days after Brown’s first truncated demonstration, he returned again uptown,arriving at the Columbia School of Mines on Friday with three big caged dogs inthe suddenly soggy heat of early August. This time, few but his helpers, publichealth officials, and newspaper reporters were present in the stifling lecturehall. In short order, Brown and his minions dispatched a sixty-one-pound mongrelwith AC of less than 300 volts, a ninety-one-pound Newfoundland after eightseconds, and a fifty-three-pound setter-and-Newfoundland mix who survived fourexcruciating minutes before finally collapsing, his tongue lolling out. In thesticky heat, among the smells of one of the dead dogs being dissected, Brownfelt most pleased and vindicated. “All of the physicians present,” said Brown,“expressed the opinion that a dog had a higher vitality than a man, and that,therefore, a current which killed a dog would be fatal to a man.”11[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts11a]First thing the next day, from his warm office on Wall Street, where the noisesof the street drifted in the windows open for any breeze, Harold Brown wrotetriumphantly to Arthur Kennelly out in West Orange, reporting, “We made a fineexhibit yesterday, as you will see from all the papers, and I had the report ofthe proceedings signed by all present and sent to the associated pressthroughout the country. I missed you, but as no representative of thealternating current concerns favored us, it was just as well that there shouldbe no Edison man there…. Whatever action the Board of Electrical Control maytake, it is certain that yesterday’s work will get a law passed by thelegislature in the fall, limiting the voltage of alternating currents to 300volts.”12 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts12a] At the bottom of thistypewritten letter, Brown wrote in a nice even hand, “I have lost 12 lbs overthis struggle and am all worn out, but am going to the mountains today to rest.”The Edison camp must have been delighted with Harold Brown’s tremendousget-up-and-go and his natural flair for publicity, though his confidentprediction of a state law limiting volts to 300 that fall was overly optimistic.Once rested up in the cool, pine-scented air of the mountains, Harold Brownreturned to launch the most macabre of all battles in the fast escalating War ofthe Electric Currents. The New York State Legislature, having designatedelectrocution as its official state mode of capital punishment, was now seekingtechnical advice from the Medico-Legal Society of New York. How best did oneelectrically kill condemned prisoners? The chairman of this new committeehappened to be Dr. Frederick Peterson, Harold Brown’s able assistant in both ofhis ghoulish dog-killing demonstrations at Columbia College. Brown was nowhell-bent on one thing: getting AC designated as the ideal form ofelectrocution.Most Americans that fall had turned their attention to the drama of presidentialpolitics, with Democrats cheering on President Grover Cleveland, the Big One whobacked Civil Service reform, curbed dubious Civil War pensions, and infuriatedbig business by opposing higher import duties. This bland, fat chief executivehad also charmed the nation by marrying late in life the beautiful young FrancesFolsom in a White House wedding. The Republicans rallied around Ohio senatorBenjamin “Little Ben” Harrison, a short, gray-bearded grandson of the nation’sninth president, who held the right ideas about high tariffs and wieldingAmerican clout. Harrison would win by a hair and thanked providence. ButPennsylvania’s all-powerful Republican boss, Matthew Quay, wondered if Harrisonknew “how close a number of men were compelled to approach … the penitentiary tomake him President.”13 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts13a]While the tight election contest stirred electoral passions, Harold Brown andDr. Peterson retreated to Edison’s prestigious West Orange laboratory and beganfurther dreadful experiments on how to most efficiently kill living things withelectricity. With these findings in hand, both attended the November 15 meetingof the Medico-Legal Society, where Dr. Peterson said either direct oralternating current would do the job, “but preferably the latter.”14[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts14a] The society would announce theirelectrocution decision at their December 12 meeting. Not content to wait for thesociety’s decision, Harold Brown swung right back into action, orchestrating anew demonstration that would silence once and for all critics who scoffed thatkilling dogs was not at all comparable to killing humans. Brown needed toexecute creatures more akin in size to grown men.Once again, the Edison people happily made available the famous West Orange labfor what they termed a “matter of very great importance.”15[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts15a] On the overcast, chillyafternoon of December 5, Brown and Dr. Peterson were admitted to the Edisoncomplex in West Orange. Assembled in the back in a brightly lit room werenumerous reporters and Edison men, several important physicians from theMedico-Legal Society, and two members of the New York State Death Commission:Buffalo dentist Dr. Southwick, who first drew Edison into the issue, and thechairman, Elbridge T. Gerry, long active in the New York Society for thePrevention of Cruelty to Children and its sister society for animals, the ASPCA.Gerry was author of the state’s electrocution bill. Brown’s greatest coup thatday was, without question, the august presence of Thomas A. Edison, whoheretofore had served only as a silent and reclusive sage (rather than general)for the DC forces. World renowned, a national icon, Edison instantly imbued thelethal proceedings with great legitimacy and an inevitable glamour. Now, here inthe celebrated Edison laboratory, these distinguished guests would see withtheir own eyes just how deadly the alternating current really was.First came a soft-eyed calf bought from the local butcher. It walked docilelyonto a sheet of tin laid on the laboratory floor, its hooves making a loudcrackling noise on the metal. Tied to a nearby post, the 124-pound calf was cuton the forehead and upper spine, and sponge-covered plates were fastened tothose places. The tin “rug” was attached to wires fed by an alternator, all thisbeing first-rate Edison apparatus. The AC was then zapped up to 700 volts, andafter thirty seconds the calf collapsed heavily and died. A second calf weighing145 pounds was electrocuted after only five seconds. The pièce de résistance wasnow brought forth: a large, healthy horse weighing 1,230 pounds. Here was abeast far bigger and stronger than any criminal. It whinnied lightly as copperwires were wound around its forelegs. The men stood back, for no one wanted tobe struck by the horse’s flailing hooves if things went wrong. When the voltagehit 700, the horse slumped to its knees, dead. This impressive display of lethalAC electricity and the presence of Edison were all that Brown could have hopedfor.The next morning, The New York Times solemnly reported, “The experiments provedthe alternating current to be the most deadly force known to science, and thatless than half the pressure used in this city [1,500 to 2,000 volts] forelectric [arc] lighting by this system is sufficient to cause instant death.After Jan. 1 the alternating current will undoubtedly drive the hangman out ofbusiness in this State.”16 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts16a]Indeed, at the December 12 meeting of the Medico-Legal Society at the PaletteClub on West 24th Street, the group unanimously adopted the electrocutioncommittee’s proposal of “death by alternating current” and its recommendationthat the criminal be executed in “a recumbent position, on a table covered withrubber, or the sitting position, in a chair especially constructed for thepurpose.”17 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts17a] New York State wason its way to being the first government in history to execute condemnedcriminals with electricity.Out in Pittsburgh, where the roaring iron and steel furnaces spewed forth theusual fiery layers of filthy smoke, George Westinghouse read the newspaperstories about Brown’s latest electrical slaughter and muffled his fury so hecould write a careful, reasoned reply. This long letter ran in various New Yorkpapers the day after the Medico-Legal Society had voted to endorse alternatingcurrent for electrocutions. George Westinghouse pointed out that even as Mr.Brown categorically claimed to have proved that anything over 300 volts of ACwas deadly, “a large number of persons can be produced who have received aone-thousand volt shock from alternating currents without injury.” Once again,Westinghouse emphasized his company’s huge success. The 1888 Edison annualreport showed central station orders totaling forty-four thousand lights for thewhole year. Contrast that, he suggested, with his firm’s orders just for Octoberof forty-eight thousand lights.As was his way, Westinghouse minced no words, scoffing that “the business wouldnot have had this enormous and rapidly increasing growth if there had beenconnected with it the dangerous features which Mr. Harold P. Brown and hisassociates of the Edison company so loudly proclaim…. We have no hesitation incharging that the objects of these experiments is not in the interest of scienceor safety.”18 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts18a] In one of the mostbizarre rejoinders of all time, the egregious Harold Brown wrote to thenewspapers and challenged his Pittsburgh nemesis to an electric duel! Like agentleman of old throwing down a gauntlet, Brown insulted Westinghouse bycharging that the great industrial leader cared only about “the pecuniaryinterests … of the death-dealing alternating current” that had “crippled,paralyzed or otherwise injured for life a number of men.” Then Brown laid outthe nature of this unique duel: “I challenge Mr. Westinghouse to meet me in thepresence of competent electrical experts and take through his body thealternating current while I take through mine a continuous current…. We willcommence with 100 volts, and will gradually increase the pressure 50 volts at atime, I leading with each increase, until either one or the other has criedenough, and publicly admits his error.”19[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts19a] Westinghouse did not deign torespond.image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_064_r1.jpg]Stephen Gray’s demonstration of the Electrified Dangling Boy.FROM A COPPER-PLATE ENGRAVING IN J.

First and foremost wasHarold Brown’s triumph in having alternating current designated as the officialNew York State “executioner’s current.” Equally important, from the DCstandpoint, most public discussions of electricity now revolved largely aroundquestions of safety, with the Edison systems always emerging the shining exampleof truly safe electricity—low voltage and buried wires. The fact that Edison’scentral plant electricity was expensive and unsuitable for anyplace buthigh-density cities was rarely a part of the discussion.The spring of 1889 delivered further delightful victories for the Edison forces.Brown was hired by the New York State prisons as their electrical expert. Hewould design its electrocution apparatus, guaranteeing that Westinghousemachines would soon be used and indelibly linked to an odious death. The monthof March brought the dramatic implosion of the French copper corner aftereighteen expensive months. Monsieur Secretan, historian Kenneth Ross Tooleexplains, “had, first of all, forgotten the junkman. His scheme was predicatedon control of the world’s supply of copper. But with copper at 17 cents, in veryshort time scrap dealers had thrown at least 70,000 long tons on the market[about a quarter of the world’s annual consumption]…. Secretan’s secondmiscalculation was with regard to consumption. When the price of copper soared,many consumers simply stopped buying it.”20[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts20a] The electrical world turned outto be far less voracious a captive customer than assumed. The copper syndicatefound itself sitting atop one hundred thousand tons of gleaming red metal itcould not sell for what it had paid. The French banks and the major worldproducers quickly reached an agreement that would leave copper at twelve centsfor the foreseeable future.The fall served up yet more unalloyed victories for the DC forces. For fouryears, Edison’s electric light bulb patent cases had been dragging along. Insome courts, Edison had received severe setbacks, in others some encouragement.In 1886, Westinghouse had felt so certain Edison’s patent was doomed that heindulged himself and struck back by filing a retaliatory suit. The Westinghousecase, in the guise of Consolidated Electric Light, which held the originalSawyer-Man light bulb patents, had been filed against McKeesport Light Company,an Edison entity. Then, on October 4, 1889, Justice Bradley of the United StatesCircuit Court in Pittsburgh delivered a serious setback to the light bulbinfringers. The good judge upheld Edison’s longtime assertion that whatdifferentiated his light bulb from all its many unworkable predecessors was“high resistance in the conductor with a small illuminating surface and acorresponding diminution in the strength of current. This was accomplished byEdison … and was really the grand discovery in the art of electric lighting,without which it could not have come into general use in houses and cities…. Butfor this discovery electric lighting would never have become a fact.”21[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts21a] Westinghouse sought to buy timeby appealing the case.When Nikola Tesla journeyed to Pittsburgh to help develop his AC induction motorand polyphase system, he had finally met George Westinghouse, now forty-one. Headmired him right away. Wrote Tesla, “Even to a superficial observer,[Westinghouse’s] latent force was manifest. A powerful frame, well-proportioned,with every joint in working order, an eye as clear as crystal, a quick andspringy step—he presented a rare example of health and strength. Like a lion inthe forest, he breathed deep and with delight the smoky air of his factories.”22[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts22a] Tesla toured the impressiveWestinghouse electrical shops, met the engineers, and then returned briefly toNew York to wrap up his affairs before returning to Pittsburgh to work as aconsultant with the Westinghouse Electric Company.Almost certainly, Tesla was a guest for a time under the Westinghouse roof inleafy Homewood at Solitude. The handsome white brick villa with its white windowawnings lowered against the summer heat was surrounded by an attractive array offlower and vegetable gardens. To one side, a long grape arbor provided afiltered shady retreat. The leaves of large ginkgo trees waved and shimmered inthe sun. Across the railroad tracks, truck farmers were tending tomatoes andvegetables. The otherwise gracious Westinghouse home had one jarring aspect—thefestoons of electric wires drooping along the ceilings and up the stairway.Naturally Westinghouse had installed electricity in Solitude, but he hadinsisted all the wires remain freely accessible so he could test out newimprovements as they came along. The dynamo and generator were far back out inthe stable, and the subway that connected the generator to the villa was bigenough for a man to walk in.After the sudden acclaim and overnight wealth of 1888, Tesla’s ensuing year inPittsburgh was a sharp reminder of the perilous journey between invention andcommercial success. First off, it turned out that Nikola Tesla’s much ballyhooedAC induction motor did not, as George Westinghouse had hoped, have any value fortraction work, which eliminated its use for the fast-growing and lucrativeelectric streetcar business. Then, it was worryingly obvious that the polyphaseinduction motors as shown at Columbia College did not mesh easily with theWestinghouse single-phase AC central lighting stations. Tesla had early onconcluded that the ideal frequency was 60 cycles, and all his AC inductionmotors were so designed. The Westinghouse engineers, however, had designed alltheir AC central lighting stations to operate at more than twice that frequency,or 133 cycles. Tesla did not endear himself to his new colleagues when heinsisted that the central stations would have to be retrofitted, for otherwisethey would never get a workable AC motor.The Westinghouse engineers were loath to concede Tesla’s point and undertakesuch a major revamping. Like many pioneers of the electrical fraternity, theWestinghouse electricians resented this flowery fellow declaring that everythingthey knew about making electricity and running motors was now passé andirrelevant. They resented his sudden wealth and fame and the widespread beliefby knowledgeable men that he was going to be as big as, maybe bigger than,Edison. Even a world-celebrated writer like Mark Twain had been quietlyconfiding to his diary in November of 1888, “I have just seen the drawings anddescriptions of an electrical machine lately patented by a Mr. Tesla, and soldto the Westinghouse Company, which will revolutionize the whole electricbusiness of the world. It is the most valuable patent since the telephone.” MarkTwain, a great writer who was a notable flop in his own various forays intononliterary business, never wrote truer words. And that assertion was what wasso immensely galling to the Westinghouse engineers. As the months passed, theyand some of the electrical press had the satisfaction of concluding that Teslawas full of hot air. It did not help that Shallenberger’s new AC electric meterwas quickly and easily adapted to existing Westinghouse AC systems, withimpressive results. As soon as customers saw bills based on usage, they beganturning off unneeded lights. Westinghouse central stations equipped with metersnow had to generate only a half to two-thirds the amount of electricity as thosecentral stations operating still without meters. The savings to the company weredramatic.Charles Scott was too young and too much of a newcomer at Westinghouse to harborany animosity. Assigned to work with Tesla as his assistant, helping to build ACinduction motors and test them, he was overjoyed. “It was a splendid opportunityfor a beginner, this coming in contact with a man of such eminence, rich inideas, kindly and friendly in disposition. Tesla’s fertile imagination oftenconstructed air castles which seemed prodigious. But, I doubt whether even hisextravagant expectations of the toy motor of those days measured up to actualrealization.”23 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts23a] Young Scott alsoadmired how in these trying months, Westinghouse himself was always “suggesting,inspiring, directing, urging. Each step was a progress toward a universal systemof power distribution. That was his great vision and ambition…. [It is hard to]realize how little was then known to imagine the magnitude of what might developwhen means were found for making larger generators and larger transformers whichwould not short-circuit or overheat.”24[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts24a]And so, thwarted and frustrated in Pittsburgh, Tesla prepared to retreat toManhattan. “Having worked one year in the shops of George Westinghouse,Pittsburgh,” he would later say, “I experienced so great a longing for resumingmy interrupted investigations that, notwithstanding a very tempting propositionby him, I left for New York to take up my laboratory work.”25[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts25a] That was in the fall of 1889,and Tesla was soon ensconced in a new laboratory on Grand Street. Tesla,reported his friend and biographer, John J. O’Neill, was “thoroughly disgusted….He felt his advice concerning his own invention was not being accepted.” He alsotold O’Neill, “I was not free at Pittsburgh. I was dependent and could not work.To do creative work I must be completely free. When I became free of thatsituation ideas and inventions rushed through my brain like Niagara.”26[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts26a] One suspects that many among theentrenched electrical brotherhood experienced a highly delicious frisson ofschadenfreude, for Nikola Tesla had returned from Westinghouse without managingto produce a commercial AC induction motor that could operate with the firm’stwo hundred central stations.Thus, as October brought pleasant fall weather to the clamorous streets ofManhattan and society prepared to whirl into high gear with the Patriarchs’ Ballat Delmonico’s, Edison could feel happy about the drop in copper prices, hisclear-cut light bulb patent win in the courts, and Tesla’s humbling in the realworld of making things work. There was also the unexpected appearance of a newand powerful player. All through the War of the Electric Currents, both Edisonand Westinghouse were continually in the public eye, whether through theirproxies or firsthand. Notably absent from this very public fray was the othermajor AC company, the Thomson-Houston Company of Lynn, Massachusetts, which hadexpanded from arc lighting into AC incandescent central stations. But CharlesCoffin of the Thomson-Houston Company, ever the mover and the shaker, wasyearning to enter the fray."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_023_r1.jpg]An early electric chairCHAPTER 8“The Horrible Experiment”As the streaked gray sky lightened on Friday morning, March 29, 1889, one JohnHort drunkenly sauntered forth from the noisy warmth of a bar on Buffalo’s toughwaterfront into the morning cold. A bantam of a fellow with a dark bushy beardand heavy-lidded eyes, Hort, twenty-eight, was a successful huckster, a sellerof fruits and vegetables. A habitué of the port’s many lowlife saloons, Hortoften passed whole afternoons bellied up to one polished bar or another,drinking morosely. Sometimes he would stumble out, perch himself on the barrelsin front of a nearby mission house, and spend hours staring vacantly andtwiddling his thumbs. Thursday night had been just another hard night ofdrinking. For hours John Hort had swilled buckets of stale beer and slung backcheap whiskey with John “Yellow” DeBella, his boarder and employee. Through therowdy noise of the saloon, Hort had been unusually loquacious, haranguing allthose around that his wife, Tillie, was a wanton whore.Hort, thoroughly drunk and in vile humor, walked home through the cold, mistydawn. A little before 8:00, he reached his ground-floor apartment at 526Division Street, a big run-down cottage, and flung open the door to the dingyrooms. There in the small kitchen stood Tillie, thirty-one, an attractive enoughwoman still in her morning wrap, and her four-year-old daughter, Ella. The warmkitchen smelled of baking potatoes and frying eggs. Hort fixed Tillie, who wasstanding at the stove holding the frying pan, with a drunken stare, yelled ather that she was a harlot, and then staggered out to the barn, where his sixworkers were loading his fruit and vegetable wagons and hitching up the restlesshorses. Hort’s young peddlers knew to steer clear when their boss was soused andsimmering mad. One noticed him walk across the hay-covered stable floor, grab anax off its holder on the barn wall, and head back to his apartment. Soon thecool morning was rent with curdling shrieks, shattering dishes, a rhythmicwhacking, then silence and low moans.The landlady, Mrs. Mary Reid, rushed to the Horts’ front door and called, “Mrs.Hort,” several times, but she heard only the gurgled groans. Then she ran aroundto the side, there to see Hort staggering forth from his back door, his hands,his arms, his very beard, smeared with blood. “Mr. Hort,” she asked wildly,“what have you done?”“I have killed Mrs. Hort.”She looked terrified. “No, you have not.”Coolly he answered, “Yes, I have, and I’ll take the rope for it.”As Mrs. Reid ran to get help, Hort returned inside. A man visiting his father ina nearby house put on his hat and came running in response to Mrs. Reid’stearful shouts for help. Later, he would recount, “I opened the door of thekitchen and looked in. A woman was upon the floor on her hands and knees, bloodall over her and her hair hanging down, her body swaying backwards and forwards.I shut the door.” He steadied himself and then opened the door again. “A manstood before me. He was wiping his hands on something. They were bloody. Hestepped over the body.” The horrified visitor said to Hort as he walked out,“This is brutal, man. Let us go for a doctor.”But Hort was continuing back toward the barn. One of his young peddlers wasstanding there petrified as he saw his bloodied boss. “Go for a policeman,” Hortinstructed him dully, “I have killed my wife.” When the peddler boy hesitated,Hort said again, “I’ve done it and I expect to take the rope.” Then Hort wobbledslowly off to Thomas Martin’s saloon, where he was demanding whiskey when apolice officer arrested him. “I want the rope,” said the dazed Hort, “the soonerthe better.”Back by the barn, a horse-drawn ambulance had clattered into the yard and theunconscious, bloodied Tillie Hort, her head etched with ax wounds, was carriedout and taken to Fitch Hospital, where the efforts of surgeons accomplishedlittle. She expired half an hour after midnight. By April 2, The Buffalo EveningNews was able to report that Hort “laid it all to jealousy and bad temper. Hesaid he went into the house from the barn with the hatchet in his hand, andwithout any words hit her on the head.”1[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts1a] But in fact Hort was not JohnHort, but William Kemmler, and Tillie was not really his wife, but his paramour,and her last name was Ziegler. The two had run away from their despised mates inPhiladelphia with little four-year-old Ella and sought a new life in boomingBuffalo. Instead of a new life, the man the local press quickly labeled the“South Division Street hatchet fiend” was about to achieve invidious notorietywith a new death. Within a week of Tillie’s vicious murder, The Buffalo EveningNews blared on page one the strange and terrible fate awaiting this fiend:ELECTRIC DEATH. THE HORRIBLE EXPERIMENT WHICH MURDERER KEMMLER WILL HAVE TOSUFFER IF CONVICTED.The Buffalo police electrician waxed most philosophical and skeptical: “Theseso-called experts say they know that they can kill a man instantly. I would liketo know how they can tell that…. Sometimes you will notice that a man or womanis killed by electricity by accident. Then again they will only be shocked. Howdo you account for that? … They may put a murderer in a metallic chair and whenthe circuit is turned on it may only paralyze him. What a horrible death thatwould be. So what will they do if the shock does not kill?”2[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts2a]Through William Kemmler’s four-day trial in early May, the “hatchet fiend” sathunched over and silent. A jury convicted him on May 10, and in the midst of athunder-and-lightning storm on May 13, 1889, the judge sentenced him to die byelectricity, a coincidence duly observed by the local press. The case attractedmuch attention nationally purely because of the unique form of death awaitingKemmler. Back in New York City, Harold Brown, now the official New York Stateexpert on electrical execution, was alerting his allies that “a conviction underthe new law was reached at Buffalo on Friday—a brute who chopped a woman intobits with an axe.”3 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts3a] Brown hadlong since taken to calling AC “the executioner’s current.” It was an oddcoincidence that the first victim of the newfangled electric chair was to befrom Buffalo, for that was also the home of Dr. Alfred P. Southwick, the dourdentist and thanatologist so instrumental in replacing the hangman’s rope withthe electric current. It was also the first city where Westinghouse hadinstalled an AC central station to light up the four floors of fancy goodsoffered by the luxurious Adam, Meldrum & Anderson department store.Now, at last, in the spring of 1889, Edison and Brown had their official humanvictim. With that, the War of the Electric Currents entered its most ghoulishand macabre phase. Arrayed on the DC side were, of course, Harold Brown andThomas Edison, both delighted that a human being was to be officially andspecifically electrocuted with the “man-killing” Westinghouse generators. Thiswould be a stupendous public relations coup, indelibly linking alternatingcurrent to death and criminality. On the other side, naturally, stood GeorgeWestinghouse, equally determined to thwart the ignoble defilement of hismachines, whose whole purpose was to bring lovely light and clarity into thedaily lives of men and women.At the time of William Kemmler’s trial in Buffalo, all the money the accused axmurderer had in the world was about $500 from the selling of all his vegetablewagons and horses. But Kemmler said very definitely he would not spend any ofthat on lawyers, because he intended to turn over this sum for Tillie’sburial—in a silver-handled casket, no less—and for the future care of Tillie’slittle girl, Ella. Yet soon after Kemmler’s death sentence, one of the era’srising legal stars, former New York congressman W. Bourke Cockran, materializedas Kemmler’s champion. Cockran would forcibly argue that death in the electricchair was a violation of federal and state constitutional prohibitions againstcruel and unusual punishment. Were his handsome fees as William Kemmler’schampion paid by Westinghouse? It was widely assumed so, but never definitivelyproven.For this most cold-blooded of all the DC versus AC battles, it would be Cockran,not Westinghouse, who led the public attack. Cockran, thirty-five, was alreadywell seasoned in battles political and legal, a celebrated orator of the GildedAge who would soon return to Congress to serve another decade. A top-levelsachem in New York’s Tammany wigwam, Cockran had landed up in Manhattan at ageseventeen, an Irish immigrant with the unlikely advantage of an elegant Frencheducation. Tall, commanding, with a leonine head, deep-set eyes, and aclean-shaven, expressive face, Cockran was always a firm friend of thedown-and-out. But he was also a highly paid corporate lawyer, acting, forinstance, as counsel to Joseph Pulitzer, owner of the fabulously successful andinfluential New York World newspaper. Cockran’s later legal clients includedmany of the great corporations of the day—railroads, utilities, steamship lines.Yet the ardent opposition of this silver-voiced attorney (who spoke still withan Irish lilt) to capital punishment led him to represent a number of murderersduring his illustrious legal career.Even as Cockran was preparing his appeal of Kemmler’s electrocution, HaroldBrown was pushing forward with the grisly practical details of the electrocutionapparatus. Every step of the way, he required, and received, Thomas Edison’sall-important support. First in early March, when Brown had had to perform a fewdemonstrations for the New York State prison authorities, an Edison officialaiding Brown wrote desperately to his boss, Thomas Edison, “I have been tryingfor the past week to buy, borrow or steal a Westinghouse dynamo but have beenunsuccessful. I am afraid therefore that we shall have to trespass again uponyour good nature…. Would it be possible to rewind your Siemens alternatingdynamo so that we can get at least 1000 volts?”4[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts4a] It all went smoothly, and thestate said it would order three dynamos for Auburn, Sing Sing, and DannemoraPrisons, and it would purchase them from Brown, but the terms were quite strict:The state would pay the estimated $7,000 cost of the dynamos only when “thefirst execution proves that the plant is suitable for the purpose.”5[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts5a] From his new prestigious WallStreet address, Brown wrote a wheedling letter to Edison on March 27, stating hewould need $5,000 to be able to afford to proceed and “the people at 16 BroadStreet [Edison corporate headquarters] do not feel like undertaking the matterunless you approve of it. Do you not think it worth doing, as it will enable me,through the Board of Health, to shut off the alternating current circuits in theState?”6 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts6a]At this critical moment, the wheeling-dealing Charles Coffin of theThomson-Houston Company quietly stepped forward. At first glance, the firm’ssurreptitious entry into the fray was decidedly odd, since Thomson-Houston hadbeen an AC proponent and for two years the firm had paid a licensing fee toWestinghouse. But that all had ended the previous year when Westinghouse lost apatent suit over the Gaulard-Gibbs transformers. Freed from the licensingalliance with Westinghouse, Thomson-Houston was engaged in active talks about apossible merger with Edison Electric. So Coffin began secretly helping Brown tobuy used Westinghouse alternators for the three prisons. This was a criticallogistical victory. The DC forces now had their “man-killing” ACmachines—manufactured by Westinghouse. On the Fourth of July, while others wereenjoying patriotic speeches and parades of Civil War veterans, Brown wasdevoting himself to electrical death, informing Coffin defensively, “I havewithstood tremendous pressure and tempting offers to use other machines for thatpurpose but have nevertheless kept my agreement to the letter.”7[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts7a]When on May 23 a fully sober Kemmler was led off the Buffalo train at Auburn, hewas escorted straight across the tree-lined street. Before him loomed AuburnPrison, a gray stone fortress surrounded by a thick twenty-foot-high wall withmanned guard towers. The prison’s grim and ominous appearance had been softenedsomewhat over the years by a luxuriant covering of green ivy alive with gailytwittering brown sparrows. Located in the small town of the same name on theheavily traveled Erie Canal halfway between Buffalo and Albany, Auburn Prisonwas the second built in the New York State system and had opened in 1817. Asidefrom the busy chirping and twittering of the sparrows, the prison wasunnaturally quiet, even though it housed 1,200 inmates. All were garbed in itsfamous black-and-white-striped uniforms, and all were subject to the prison’smuch admired system of extreme regimentation. “Absolutely no communication wasallowed among the men,” writes Thom Metzger. “Their eyes were to be downcast atall times. They did the ‘Auburn’ shuffle marching in lockstep with one hand onthe next man’s shoulder wherever they went.”8[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts8a] Amid the habitat of more than onethousand men, one heard only the muffled sound of lockstep movement. Oddly,William Kemmler, as a condemned man, was exempt from this regime. In his tinycell, he was allowed to wear regular clothes and hear human voices. The guardswho kept him under continual watch read Bible stories and popular novels aloud,perhaps comforted by the sound of a human voice in that grimly silent place.As June turned to July in that summer of 1889, attorney Bourke Cockran’sconstitutional appeal of Kemmler’s death in the electric chair slowly movedforward. Cayuga County judge Edwin Day authorized Buffalo attorney Tracy C.Becker to serve as a referee, taking testimony to determine whether death byelectricity would be less painful than the traditional hangman’s noose or ifelectrocution was more cruel and unusual and therefore unconstitutional. HaroldBrown was scheduled to testify, of course, which created some uneasiness in theEdison camp. A fortnight before the hearings were to begin, the EnglishmanArthur Kennelly, Edison’s chief electrician, contacted Brown. “At Mr. Edison’sinstance,” Kennelly advised, they wanted Brown to be aware that “the onlyargument of any weight which can be urged against electrocide on the score of acruel punishment is that its application may burn the flesh of the criminal atthe points of contact, and that the amount of current which can be given withoutsuch mutilation is not yet known.”9[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts9a]The first day of hearings was Monday, July 9, in Bourke Cockran’s well-appointedoffices at the prestigious and splendid Equitable Building. Through the openwindows, for it was summer, came the muted cacophony of Broadway below, newsboysyelling the day’s headlines, hawkers tempting passersby with corn on the cob,teamsters lashing their horses forward. For the next two months, thesilver-tongued Cockran would hammer pleasantly away at two fundamentalquestions: Were the various electrical experts genuinely knowledgeable in theaspects of electricity at issue here? and How could anyone guarantee instant andpainless death, death that was not cruel and unusual, to William Kemmler whenthere were so many instances of people subjected to huge amounts of electricitywho had survived? Like any great orator, Bourke Cockran understood the power ofhumor and public fun. So while a major part of his legal strategy was to producea stream of people who questioned the certainty of quick, painless death fromelectricity, they themselves often having personally survived great shocks fromlightning and wires, he also introduced as evidence (and comic relief) theamazing dog Dash.The first witness was, fittingly enough, Harold Brown. Once on the stand, Brownreceived a thorough grilling, albeit delivered with Cockran’s silvery Irishlilt. Cockran began by establishing that Brown, who described his professionalstatus as an electrical engineer, was not particularly well trained in thatfield or well regarded. He was not, Brown conceded, a member of the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers, nor did he have any schooling beyond highschool. Brown asserted that his thirteen years working for such companies asWestern Electric and Brush Electric were equal to any degree. He had been on hisown for five years. “My particular business at present is designing apparatusfor people who require it, or standing as an expert between the purchaser ofelectric apparatus and the company supplying them … or as an expert in advisingin matters in which electricity is used.” He insisted that “I at present amentirely independent of any company.”Brown seemed quite pleased when Cockran began inquiring about the dynamo machinefor Auburn Prison. “That is actually there?” Oh, indeed, Brown said smugly, andit was a Westinghouse alternating current dynamo. Through two days ofquestioning, Brown conceded little. He did have to admit that there was one dog,Ajax, who refused to die during Brown’s dog-killing experiments despite numerouselectrical jolts. But generally Brown remained adamant that he was well enoughversed in practical electricity to guarantee Kemmler a quick, painless death.All in all, reported The New York Times, Brown “underwent the ordeal” oftestifying “without being disconcerted.”10[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts10a] Certainly Brown’s own fortuneshad risen considerably since he’d appointed himself to lead the anti-AC battle.His offices had moved from the unfashionable boondocks of West 54th Street tothe golden precincts of 45 Wall Street. And he was now a recognized ally ofAmerica’s most prominent inventor and electrician.On Monday, the hearings recommenced in Cockran’s offices. That day’s witnessesserved Cockran’s purposes well. Daniel Gibbens, one of the fecklesscommissioners from the New York City Board of Electrical Control who had watchedBrown’s dog killings, turned out to be skeptical of quick and certain electricaldeath. He grimaced just remembering the dog trials. “It was one of the mostfrightful scenes I have ever witnessed. The dogs writhed and squirmed and gavevent to their agony in howls and piteous wails.” As for electricity itself,Gibbens said, it was so unpredictable in its effects on different animals andpeople, “just as the effect of whisky varies when used by different men.”11[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts11a]Then Cockran brought on an odd character named Alexander McAdie, a Harvardgraduate who had worked at the U.S. Signal Service Laboratory in Washington,D.C., there devoting himself to the study of lightning. Cockran asked the youngman if he thought the electric chair would work. He responded haltingly, “Itsdeadly effect would depend upon the subject’s resistance and upon the routethrough the body…. It might only paralyze one half of his body and leave theother half unharmed…. It might kill him, and if it didn’t kill him instantly, itmight carbonize him—burn him up…. Yes, I think it would char his flesh.”12[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts12a] The strange Mr. McAdie, who hadleft the weather service to study lightning on his own, described standing atopthe pinnacle of the Washington Monument during a thunderstorm and deliberatelytaking lightning through his own body—and here he was to tell the tale. One canimagine Cockran’s glee at this damaging testimony. “Carbonize” Kemmler—if thatwasn’t cruel and unusual, what was?To keep up the lively doubts generated in the morning session, after lunchCockran brought on one of his most entertaining witnesses: Dash the dog, a“splendid looking … big fellow, a cross between a Scotch collie and a St.Bernard.” Dash, it was related, had been thrown four feet in the air by adangling Western Union wire supercharged with errant AC, knocked unconscious,feared dead, and then revived many hours later. Dash was living canine proofthat a big mammal could be knocked out cold, taken for dead from electric shock,and gradually come back to life. Might Dash the dog foretell Kemmler’s dreadfulfate of rising from the seeming dead? This was disquieting information to thestate, which wished Kemmler’s life permanently and electrically extinguished.Surely putting a man to death twice would be considered cruel and unusual? Theday ended with the cheering news that Elbridge T. Gerry, head of the legislativeNew York State Death Commission (which promoted electricity over the rope),would now be able to detach himself from the summery delights of yachting atNewport to testify at the next day’s session.Cockran’s puckish approach to the deadly question of painless finality hadstirred up enough naysayers and doubters to get the state and Harold Brownworried. On July 17, the day after Dash the dog’s winning appearance, HaroldBrown was anxiously requesting the ultimate reinforcement for this battle ofjudicial opinion: the appearance of the world-famous electrical wizard Thomas A.Edison. Who would give a second thought to a McAdie or a Gibbens if Edison saidthe electric chair was a sure thing? In the year and a half since Thomas Edisonhad written that fateful letter to Dr. Southwick endorsing electricity ingeneral—and Westinghouse machines in particular—for electrocution, the greatinventor had never once personally appeared in a public forum or uttered apublic word on the whole matter, allowing others always to wage his battles. Nowfor the first time he was flushed out from the shadows. Without his influence,Harold Brown and the state might lose to the silver-tongued Cockran.On July 23, a cool and rainy day in an unusually cool summer, Edison salliedforth for the first time to assume personal leadership of the DC forces. Heascended to Bourke Cockran’s law offices, which were filled with eagerspectators hoping to see and hear America’s most celebrated inventor in theguise of star witness. Harold Brown attended as his aide-de-camp. Such was thegreat man’s deafness that the yelled questions and Edison’s equally loud answers“might have been heard on the street,” reported The New York Times. At onepoint, a smiling Edison arose and dragged his chair closer to Cockran so hecould hear through his better ear. There was a great deal of (loud) discussiononce again about what the average man’s resistance was in ohms, since presumablyresistance was an integral reason some men survived big electric shocks andothers keeled over dead. How could anyone know for sure? But Edison did. He saidhe had made numerous experiments of resistance on the 250 men in his lab beforecoming to testify. This revered scientist and inventor, the man who had broughtthe electric light to the world, was unequivocal in his answers to BourkeCockran’s questions. Asked Cockran loudly in his Irish brogue: “In yourjudgment, can artificial electric current be generated and applied in such a wayto produce death in human beings in every case?”“Yes,” said Edison, fingering his unlit, half-smoked cigar.“Instantly?” Cockran asked.“Yes.” Edison’s only caveat was that “the culprit’s hands [should be placed] ina jar of water diluted with caustic potash and connecting the electrodestherewith.”“How much of a current do you think it would take to burn a man?” Cockran askedvery loudly. The New York Times reported the following exchange.Edison thought a moment and answered probably “‘several thousand horse power …you’d probably burn him up.’“‘Have a nice little bonfire with him, would you?’“‘Oh, no,’ said Edison, ‘Just carbonize him.’“‘Well, Mr. Edison, with this tremendously wicked Westinghouse dynamo,’ Mr.Cockran threw all the sarcastic power at his command into the question—‘when ithas been worked up to its most thoroughly wicked point, how long do you think itwould take to burn a man?’“‘His temperature would rise 3 or 4 degrees above the normal and after a whilehe’d be mummified.’“‘Mummified,’ cried Mr. Cockran gleefully. ‘Now we are getting the trueinwardness of electrical science. How?’“‘The heat would evaporate all the fluids in his body and leave himmummyized.’”13 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts13a]Naturally, Bourke Cockran inquired about the nature of Edison’s relationshipwith Harold Brown, the official state electrical execution expert. Had Edison,for instance, ever given him a letter of recommendation? Not at all, saidEdison, obviously forgetting or ignoring a March 22, 1889, testimonial he hadprovided at Brown’s behest so Brown could prove his bona fides to the mayor ofScranton. His dealings with Mr. Brown, said Edison, were strictly limited toBrown’s use of Edison’s West Orange laboratory, a privilege granted to numerousother engineers and scientists. After a few more questions, Bourke Cockrandismissed Edison, first lighting his half-chewed cigar stub for him. Thenewspaper headlines the next day were all that Harold Brown and the EdisonCompany could have hoped for: EDISON SAYS IT WILL KILL, THE WIZARD TESTIFIES ASAN EXPERT IN THE KEMMLER CASE, HE THINKS AN ARTIFICIAL CURRENT CAN BE GENERATEDWHICH WILL PRODUCE DEATH INSTANTLY AND PAINLESSLY IN EVERY CASE—ONE THOUSANDVOLTS OF AN ALTERNATING CURRENT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT.Cockran did a yeoman’s job of trying to show that the great and beloved Edisonwas woefully ignorant on this particular aspect of electricity—its effect on thehuman body and its ability to kill swiftly and painlessly. Yet Edison’s usualcocky manner and absolute assertions carried the day. Historians Terry S.Reynolds and Theodore Bernstein argue, “Edison’s reputation probably overrodeCockran’s exposure of [Edison’s] ignorance of the effects of electricity onliving organisms.” Certainly some newspapers regarded his testimony as critical.The Albany Journal, for example, noted: “The Kemmler case at last has an expertthat knows something concerning electricity. Mr. Edison is probably the bestinformed man in America, if not the world, regarding electric currents and theirdestructive powers.”14 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts14a]Edison and his lovely young wife, Mina, sailed off to Paris ten days later for atwo-month visit. On the Continent, Edison the international celebrity was fetedat elaborate and adulatory banquets, presented official state honors from Franceand Italy, and received standing ovations at the Paris Opera, with the entirebejeweled crowd chanting, “Vive Edison! Vive Edison!” Hailed by the local pressand officials as a genius, Edison reaped phenomenal publicity for his company’sproducts at the important Paris Exposition. His exhibition enthralled hugecrowds daily with its twenty-five “perfected” phonographs speaking in dozens oflanguages, along with all manner of electrical lights and devices. Edison adoredthe Eiffel Tower, erected for the exposition by Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel as afantastic specimen of modern engineering and lit up at night from top to bottom.“The tower is a great idea,” Edison told the dozens of reporters hanging on hisevery lively phrase. “The glory of Eiffel is in the magnitude of the conceptionand the nerve of the execution. I like the French, they have big conceptions.The English ought to take a leaf out of their books. What Englishman would havehad this idea? What Englishman could have conceived the Statue of Liberty?”15[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts15a] However, the stylish Parisianway of life annoyed Edison. “What has struck me so far chiefly is the absolutelaziness of everybody over here,” he commented bluntly. “When do these peoplework? What do they work at? People here seem to have established an elaboratesystem of loafing. I don’t understand it at all.”16[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts16a]Back across the Atlantic in suddenly hot and sticky Manhattan and then in coolerBuffalo, Bourke Cockran plugged away for a few more sessions, taking thetestimony of physicians who had attended men killed by electricity or hearingfrom men who had survived lightning strikes. Cockran elaborated his basic themeswith verve, but there was no one he could produce for his side with Edison’sfame or stature. When Edison the world-famous celebrity weighed in sodefinitively for the electric chair, the battle was almost certainly lost.While New Yorkers sweltered in a blanket of oppressive August heat, theelectricians had gathered farther north in the cool and watery precincts ofNiagara Falls to vent their spleen against Edison, Brown, and the plannedelectrocution. One man angrily told his fellow members of the National ElectricLight Association, “We are here for the purpose of advancing the uses ofelectricity, to make it rejuvenate the world, to carry it forward as acivilizing agent, not as an instrument of torture…. I say, let us here condemnthat action…. Let it not be trumpeted over this country that the dying groans ofthat criminal cursed electricity with its last sound.”17[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts17a] The assembled agreed to dispatchemissaries to the governor of New York to push for repeal of death byelectricity.This was rather encouraging to the Westinghouse forces, and late August of 1889brought yet another small but delicious triumph. In its Sunday edition, the NewYork Sun ran an exposé on Harold Brown, with the headline FOR SHAME, BROWN! anda subhead that told the story: “Paid by One Electric Company to Injure Another.”Someone had broken into Harold Brown’s Wall Street office and stolen forty-fiveletters from his locked rolltop desk. These missives showed that for some timehe had indeed been advised, aided, abetted, and paid by the Edison Company andThomson-Houston, both explicit rivals of Westinghouse. As the Sun wrote, “Brownis known not to be a wealthy man, and that he could afford to devote all histime thus purely for the benefit of the human race at large with little thoughtof self, has been a mystery to those acquainted with him.”18[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts18a] Yet little changed. Browncomplained to the district attorney, requested an investigation, and offered a$500 reward for information about the thief. To the rest of the press, Brownstill blustered, “I am exposing the Westinghouse system as any right-minded manwould expose a bunco starter or the grocer who sells poison where he pretends hesells sugar.”19 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts19a]On September 11, referee Tracy C. Becker submitted to Judge Edwin Day the fullrecord of 1,025 pages of transcribed testimony, describing the widely varyingelectrical near death and actual death experiences, with all the contradictoryopinions about how quick and painless Kemmler’s electrocution would be. Justover a month later, on October 12, a few days after Thomas Edison returned intriumph from Europe, Judge Day ruled against Cockran, who immediately appealedto the Supreme Court of New York.Even as the Kemmler case dragged on through the courts, there came a great andunexpected coup for Edison: the most spectacular high-voltage death yet. It wasa death so hideous, so public, so highly visible—occurring just blocks from CityHall at lunch hour—that it galvanized the high-voltage safety debate as nothingbefore had managed to do. It was, unbelievably, the second public roasting of alineman in three days in lower Manhattan. The first death in the wires onOctober 9 killed a fellow so dissolute and brutish that his wife had long sincefled with their six children to a refuge in the country. The strong implicationwas that the first lineman was working while drunk, became careless, and managedto electrocute himself. He toppled dead onto the pavement. An ugly tale. But twodays later, on Friday, October 11, came yet worse. Far, far worse.This time, on a lovely fall noon a handful of Western Union linemen were workingforty feet up a towering wooden pole at Chambers and Center Streets, a blockfrom the magnificent Tweed Courthouse, cutting out dead wires from the greatspiderweb of lines looping hither and yon from poles to buildings and back. Farbelow, the thick lunchtime crowds surged along the sidewalks and across thestreets, weaving in between the horsecars and teamster carts. One of thelinemen, John E. H. Feeks, high above the milling throngs, was standing astridethe fourth crossbar from the bottom of the fourteen bars laddering up the top ofthe light pole. He reached through a tangle of wires to cut out a dead wire“when he was suddenly seen to shiver and tremble as though he had received aviolent shock. He put out his right hand and seized a wire as though to steadyhimself, and immediately there was a flash of flame under his hand. Then brightsparks and tongues of blue flames played all about his hand and a small cloud ofsmoke curled up into the air. His right hand next slipped from the wire and hefell forward across a network of wires which caught him across the throat andface and held him suspended some forty feet above the ground. The man appearedto be all on fire. Blue flames issued from his mouth and nostrils and sparksflew about his feet. Then blood began to drop down from the body on the pole anda great pool formed on the sidewalk below…. There was no movement to the body asit hung in the fatal burning embrace of the wires. A great crowd of peoplecollected and stood awestricken and fascinated by the fearful sight.”20[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts20a] As some men yelled for help,mesmerized spectators jammed the sidewalks and roadway, blocking all the passingstreetcars and teams. From every nearby window and roof, people craned throughthe haze of electrical wires to see this grisly sight of the smoking, sparkingman. Feeks’s body was so interwoven with the numerous wires that he swayed butdid not fall. His corpse was held horribly aloft for forty-five minutes, like apoor fly stuck in the spider’s sticky web, until at last the current was turnedoff and his blackened body extricated and lowered to the silent street.Public outrage at this latest accidental electrocution reached fever pitch.Feeks was a solid citizen and husband, long employed. A tin cracker box donatedby nearby Coogan’s Saloon was nailed to the deadly light pole for donations tothe deceased man’s pregnant wife, already mother to one child. Reported theTimes, “Men and women whose dress was of the poorest came in a constant streamand dropped in money. Newsboys, bootblacks and Italian fruit vendors broughtpennies and nickels. Drivers on the Madison avenue cars stopped their teams andran to the box to drop in a dime.” In ten hours the amazing sum of $822.23 wasgathered. Three days later, that figure had risen to $1,873.50. (It’s unlikelythat Feeks earned more than $12 a week himself.)Mayor Hugh Grant rose from his sickbed and came to City Hall to order theshutting down of all the high-voltage electric arc lights in Manhattan while thecompanies were forced to remove, repair, and upgrade the jungle of overheadwires. The citizenry, who had not experienced such pitch black cloaking the cityin decades, since before there was gaslight, were most distraught, and a greathue and cry arose at the loss of the man-made light. “Again last night did thecity seem to have gone into mourning for its lost brilliancy,” lamented The NewYork Times. “Darkness and gloom were everywhere.”21[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts21a] Several unhappy facts quicklyemerged: The New York City Board of Electrical Control had made little headwayin getting built the electrical subways mandated by law for all the city’selectrical wires. The three Tammany-appointed commissioners each took home thebreathtaking salary of $5,000 a year and rarely did a day’s work. The press hada field day of high dudgeon: OF NO USE TO THE PUBLIC, THE DILATORY BOARD OFELECTRICAL CONTROL or NOT ON THE PUBLIC’S SIDE, THEY BLOCK THE MAYOR’S EFFORTSTO HASTEN THE SUBWAY WORK—THE CITY IN DARKNESS.The heinous Feeks affair propelled Thomas Edison at long last fully into theopen. Emerging from the shadows whence he had directed Harold Brown, Edisonstood forth in all his radiance as the true general and leader of the DC forces.For the first time, Edison personally issued his own clarion battle cry in hisholy war against the “executioner’s current”: Death to AC! In the November issueof the prestigious North American Review, Edison thundered that the “themartyrdom” of Feeks offered dramatic and horrible witness of what the futureheld—unless electrical pressures (voltage) were legally limited. Edison hadheard the “popular cry” to bury the wires and restore safety to the citystreets. But this was no solution, he asserted. Burying AC wires “will resultonly in the transfer of deaths to man-holes, houses, stores, and offices,through the agency of the telephone, the low-pressure systems, and the apparatusof the high-pressure current itself.” DC should never be higher than 700 volts.As for the safe voltage for AC, “I myself have seen a large healthy dog killedinstantly by the alternating current at a pressure of one hundred andsixty-eight volts … it is difficult for me to name a safe pressure.” He thentold how his own company had purchased the ZBD patents. “Up to the present timeI have succeeded in inducing them not to offer this system to the public, norwill they ever do so with my consent. My personal desire would be to prohibitentirely the use of alternating currents. They are as unnecessary as they aredangerous.”22 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts22a]As the War of the Electric Currents grew uglier and fiercer, George Westinghousedecided in the fall of 1889 to hire a Pittsburgh newspaper reporter named ErnestH. Heinrichs to promote his companies and their achievements. On Heinrichs’sfirst day, Westinghouse came by to wish him success and explain his purpose.“All I want to see is that the papers print [things] accurately. The truth hurtsnobody.”23 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts23a] One November morningsoon thereafter, Heinrichs was installed at his desk in the brown, turretednine-story Westinghouse Building scanning a New York newspaper with an articleand an editorial attacking AC and Westinghouse. The young man became soincensed, he leaped up and rushed into his boss’s office without knocking.Westinghouse was sitting in his big upholstered chair at the gigantic woodendining table that served as his desk. He was calmly reading that selfsamenewspaper. He saw that Heinrichs was agitated and what he was clutching. ThePittsburgh industrialist cocked his great head and asked Heinrichs, “Well,what’s the hurry?”“Don’t you think we ought to say something against these slanders and falsestatements?”Heinrichs would always remember how Westinghouse eyed him for a few seconds, thewooden wall clock above the mantel ticking through the silence. ThenWestinghouse smiled.“Heinrichs, they tell me you are quite a Whist player. Is that so?”He admitted a fondness.“Well, then, you know the meaning of the expression, ‘Don’t play the otherfellow’s game.’”Heinrichs found this thoroughly puzzling. What did whist (which was akin tobridge) have to do with Edison and his calumnies? Westinghouse explained, “Nowseriously speaking, all this opposition to the Alternating Current is doing ourbusiness a great deal of good. We are getting an invaluable amount of freeadvertising…. As a practical, commercial proposition the Alternating Currentsystem is so far superior to the direct current that there is really nocomparison…. By keeping up this agitation about the deadly Alternating Current,they are playing our game and we are taking the tricks…. They hope that by theirpower, their influence, they can accomplish the arrest of the march of progress.This, by the very laws of nature cannot be done…. As to the attacks made againstme personally, of course they hurt, but my self respect and conscience do notallow me to fight with such weapons. Besides, I feel that my moral reputationand my business reputation are too well established to be hurt by such attacks.However, I am preparing an article for the North American Review in answer toMr. Edison’s charges against the Alternating Current system, but beyond that Ishall have nothing to give you for publication…. By letting the others do allthe talking, we shall make more friends in the end than if we lower ourselves tothe level of our assailants.”24 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts24a]The December issue of the North American Review could have done nothing toimprove Edison’s venomous feelings toward Westinghouse, for his adversary hadpenned a blunt and steely “Reply to Mr. Edison.” The AC-DC battle was just thelatest in a long “struggle for the control of the electric light business [that]has never been exceeded in bitterness by any of the historical commercialcontroversies of a former day. Thousands of persons have large pecuniaryinterests at stake, and, as might be expected, many of them view this greatsubject solely from the stand-point of self interest.” Westinghouse tried to putit into perspective with the following: In the year 1888, sixty-four people inNew York City were killed in streetcar accidents, fifty-five by omnibuses andwagons, twenty-three by illuminating gas, and all of five by electric current.This was not exactly an orgy of wanton and careless killing. The boldWestinghouse described Edison’s cherished DC central plant as “regarded by themajority of competent electrical engineers as in many respects radicallydefective; so defective, in fact, that, unless the use of alternating currentscan be prohibited, it seems destined to be wholly supplanted by the morescientific and in all respects (so far as concerns the users or occupants ofbuildings) far safer inductive system.”The by now familiar arguments were lobbed back and forth about copper costs,transformers, who had or had not survived shocks of what amounts. ButWestinghouse ended his counterattack with two new and terrible strikes to theEdison forces. The first was quite self-inflicted by the Edison soldiers andtherefore all the more painful. At the annual August meeting of the EdisonIlluminating Companies, held in the water-cooled environs of Niagara Falls, NewYork, Westinghouse reported, the manager of the Detroit Edison Station hadintroduced a resolution, which passed. It asked the parent company to provide “aflexible method of enlarging the territory which can be profitably covered fromtheir stations for domestic lighting by higher pressures and consequently lessoutlay of copper than that involved by the three-wire system.” Edison’s owntroops were breaking ranks and asking for AC! Westinghouse’s final and ratherdevastating salvo was simply that “for three years past the purchasers ofapparatus for electric lighting, who are at perfect liberty to buy from anycompany, have, for the most part, preferred to use the alternating system, sothat today the extension of that system for central station incandescentlighting is at least five times as great as that of direct current.”25[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts25a]Having emerged from the shadows, Thomas Edison did not retreat again. He nowproceeded to use the full force of his monumental fame and prestige to persuadethe public and politicians that there was safe electricity, which washis—low-voltage DC, whose transmission lines were safely buried—and dangerouselectricity—high-voltage AC, which was carried on open wires. His goal: Suchpublic fear of AC that it would be legally banned from use in the United States.He would thereby eliminate Westinghouse from the field and recover his owncompany’s primacy, which was faltering. Predictably, the next battlefields forthe escalating War of the Electric Currents were the state legislatures, whereEdison and Brown hoped to ruin Westinghouse by governmental bans againsthigh-voltage electricity.The first clash was at Richmond, Virginia, capital of the Old South.Westinghouse hired powerful lawyers and one of Edison’s longtime enemies,Professor Henry Morton of the Stevens Institute of Technology, to serve as anexpert. On February 12, 1890, Edison himself appeared as the first witness totestify before the Virginia State Senate. The hearing room was packed with manymen and women craning for a glimpse of America’s most beloved inventor. Edison’sworsening deafness made it hard for him to hear and, thus, to answer thecommittee’s questions. The famously witty raconteur was not as eloquent ashoped. Edison was followed by Professor Morton, who long ago had very publiclypooh-poohed Edison’s invention of the light bulb. Now, Morton denigrated his oldenemy on new grounds, asserting that AC was, contrary to Edison’s alarmistviews, a perfectly benign force when handled responsibly.But the most compelling witnesses turned out to be the local arc-lighting men,who rushed to defend their flourishing businesses from these battling Yankees.Some were even sons of the old Confederacy and thus gained instant sympathy.“The first of these gentlemen who was called upon had but one leg and used acrutch…. He expressed himself fluently and with great force…. In closing, hederided the suggestion that 3,000 volts was dangerous and exclaimed, ‘Whygentlemen, the pennyroyal bulls of Fairfax County are far more dangerous thanthat current.’”26 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts26a] TheWestinghouse men quickly saw that here were their best allies, far morepersuasive to state representatives than eminent northerners such as ThomasEdison or Professor Morton. The Edison people had failed to take into accountthe powerful arc light lobby, for almost every American city of any size now hadsome sections with arc lights. Those local companies would be destroyed by ahigh-voltage ban. The Edison DC forces would lose in Virginia, but this did notdeter Edison and Brown from pressing on, presenting their case—sometimesillustrated by Brown’s ghoulish dog shows—in other states and Canada, determinedto shut down AC via state legislatures.As 1889 turned to 1890, Judge Dwight of the Supreme Court of New York hadrejected Kemmler and Cockran’s appeal, seeing nothing cruel or unusual in deathby electricity. Cruel punishments, he wrote in his opinion, included such deathsas “burning at the stake, breaking on the wheel, being fired out of a cannon,hanging in chains to die of starvation, or disemboweling and crucifixion.”27[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts27a] When Cockran heard thedisappointing (but not unexpected) verdict, he immediately announced, “It willbe taken to the Court of Appeals.”28[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts28a] By spring of 1890, Cockran hadonce again lost. This time the court pointed out that the question of crueltyhad been thoroughly addressed by the New York State Death Commission when itchose electricity over the hangman’s rope. By late April, the newspapers werehaving a field day, churning out stories preparatory to the nearingelectrocution, describing Kemmler’s efforts to make a will, his sagging spirits,and the construction by “stripeds” of his plain pine coffin. Kemmler passed thetime in his small cell reading simple children’s Bible stories, playing apigs-in-clover puzzle (marbles tilted into holes on a small board), andlaboriously scrawling his signature on small cardboard cards that he gave to thewarden’s wife and favored guards. These were much sought after by autographcollectors.After Cockran’s appeals had come to naught, the prison issued a statement saidto be from Kemmler: “I am ready to die by electricity. I am guilty and I must bepunished. I am ready to die. I am glad I am not going to be hung. I think it ismuch better to die by electricity than it is to be hung. It will not give me anypain. I am glad Mr. Durston is going to turn the switch. He is firm and strong.If a weak man did it, I might be afraid. My faith is too firm for me to weaken.They say I am not converted. I don’t care what they think. I know what I’ve got.I am happy to die. I have never been so happy in my life as I have been here.”Rampant rumors that Kemmler had gone stir-crazy under the strain of waiting forhis electrocution may have prompted this report to show Kemmler’s state of mind:resigned but sane.And what of “The New Instrument of Execution”? In the same November 1889 issueof the prestigious North American Review that featured Thomas Edison’shigh-minded crusade urging that AC be outlawed, Harold P. Brown was describing(in an article with this very title) what the electric chair would do and how itwould work. He imagined the coming event: “The condemned criminal’s cell isvisited by the prison authorities and his hands and feet are saturated with theweak potash solution which so rapidly overcomes the skin’s resistance; duringthis space of thirty seconds or less the electrical resistance may be measured….Shod in wet felt slippers, the convict walks to the chair and is instantlystrapped into position, his feet and hands are again immersed in the potashsolution contained in a foot-tub connected to one pole and in hand-basinsconnected to the other. With this perfect contact there is no possibility ofburning of the flesh and thus reducing the effect of the current upon the body.“Dials of electrical instruments indicate that all the apparatus is in perfectorder and record the pressure at every moment. The deputy-sheriff closes theswitch. Respiration and heart-action instantly cease, and electricity, with avelocity equaling that of light, destroys life…. There is a stiffening of themuscles, which gradually relax after five seconds have passed; but there is nostruggle and no sound. The majesty of the law has been vindicated, but nophysical pain has been caused.”29[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts29a]In late April, the twenty-five witnesses to the state’s first officialelectrocution began to gather in Auburn. Harold Brown was conspicuous by hisabsence. Almost certainly, his unmasking a year earlier by the Sun as anEdison/Thomson-Houston corporate lackey had diminished his usefulness to thoseparties. When his original contract as the state’s expert on electricalexecution had expired on May 1, Brown did nothing to extend it. Perhaps thewarden banished him. In any case, after all his eager, relentless pursuit ofelectrical death by Westinghouse AC, Harold Brown now made a great about-face,claiming to reporters, “You may rest assured that I am glad to be relieved ofthe unpleasant responsibility.”30[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts30a] Dr. Alfred P. Southwick, theBuffalo dentist and chief instigator of the electrical death penalty, wasnaturally present at Auburn as an enthusiastic witness. A big man with a fringeof white beard, he, like many others, was taken aback by the malevolentappearance of the chair itself, a brutish-looking oversize oaken armchair withwide, flat arms, a crude footrest, and a perforated wooden seat. There werenumerous thick leather restraint straps—and most disturbing, a heavy leathermask that enveloped and covered the criminal’s face, pressing it back into aneck brace that would have a saturated sponge. Southwick explained, “I amopposed to so much paraphernalia, but the present arrangement will have to do,because we cannot afford to suffer failure. The whole world is watching theresult of this experiment, and if we neglect any precautions there might be aslip and the system would therefore be condemned. I am fully convinced thatKemmler’s death will be instantaneous…. I anticipate no disfigurement at all.”31[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts31a]Just as all the preparations were being completed, a law clerk showed up inAuburn. Kemmler’s case had been further appealed! A new lawyer, Roger Sherman,who specialized in appeals, was taking up the cudgels. He came to the prison tosee Kemmler but was not allowed a visit. He left more legal papers and swiftlydeparted back down to Manhattan. Sherman denied he was in the pay of GeorgeWestinghouse, but he would not say who was paying his handsome fees. When Dr.Southwick and the other witnesses, including referee Tracy C. Becker, also fromBuffalo, heard the electrocution was off for the moment, they were thoroughlychagrined. To assuage them and provide some sort of event preparatory toKemmler’s death, Warden Charles Durston authorized the killing of a calf withthe electric chair apparatus. Within the next month, the Kemmler case hadreached the U.S. Supreme Court, with Sherman once again arguing that death byhigh voltage was cruel and unusual. But once again, in early August 1890, theKemmler-AC forces were turned down. Chief Justice Melville Fuller said the deathplanned would have to be “something inhuman and barbarous—something more thanmere extinguishment of life.”32 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts32a]Meanwhile, at the Edison headquarters, gloating executives proposed that fromhere on in, “as Westinghouse’s dynamo is going to be used for the purpose ofexecuting criminals, why not give him the benefit of this fact in the minds ofthe public, and speak hereafter of a criminal as being ‘westinghoused,’ or (touse it as a noun) as having been condemned to the westinghouse in the same waythat Dr. Guillotine’s name was forever immortalized in France?”33[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts33a] The Edison officers weresavoring this most monstrous and momentous of victories in the ongoing War ofthe Electric Currents.In the stifling August heat, Auburn’s best hotel, the four-story Osborn House,began to fill up with out-of-town reporters, mainly from New York City. Thegrimy railroad freight depot across from the high-walled prison provedconvenient for a special Western Union office, equipped with fourteen lines justto New York City. With each arriving train, more people debarked and surgedtoward the grim, walled fortress of Auburn Prison. Tellingly, the warden’s wifewas seen to leave the prison and board a train out of town. She had a certainfondness for this condemned man she had taught to read and preferred not to bepresent at the prison when he died. She had also departed in late April whenexecution appeared imminent. On August 5, there was mounting excitement amid theoppressive hot and humid weather. All day, subdued crowds gathered outside theprison walls, pushing forward and clinging to the heavy iron bars of the entrygate. Young men shimmied up telephone poles and the tall leafy trees and peeredover the twenty-foot prison walls toward the vine-covered prison building.Nearby rooftops and windows were lined with solemn spectators and reporters.That evening at 7:00 P.M., as the air cooled, many of the official statewitnesses, serious men of medicine and law, bearded and clad in lighter summersuits, walked importantly from the Osborn House through the silent assembly ofcurious townfolk and in through those heavy barred gates. Some arrived by trainand hurried across to the prison. And so, on that evening of August 5, somebelieved that the arriving witnesses were gathering for the long delayedexecution. It was but a test, however, with one of the physicians volunteeringto sit in the chair and experience the low-voltage run-through. The officialwitnesses then emerged and strolled back to the hotel in good spirits, asking tobe awakened very early.August 6, 1890, dawned the palest of blues in Auburn, and a cooling breezeriffled pleasantly through the city’s many trees. It looked to be a glorioussunny summer day. Shortly after 6:00 A.M. the official state witnesses could beseen walking in straggling groups through the quiet village streets toward thefortress-style prison. They threaded through the hundreds of curious waitingtownspeople and pacing newspaper reporters gathered outside the heavy irongates. Today, finally, William Kemmler, the “South Division Street hatchetfiend,” would become the first man in history to die in an official stateelectrocution. Each witness presented his pass and walked into the prison yard.Inside the prison itself, Warden Charles Durston looked distinctly distractedand unsettled. He had already been in earlier to see Kemmler, whose thick bushybeard and mustache had been neatly clipped. The murderer had been sitting on hiscell bunk, attired for electrical death in new dark gray sack trousers, vest,and jacket, suspenders, a white shirt, and jaunty black-and-white-checked bowtie. He had spent a great deal of time combing his hair, carefully arranging aHyperion curl on his forehead. Durston, who had often expressed distaste at hisassigned role of electrocution overseer, now entered Kemmler’s cagelike cell forthe second time that early morning and read him the state death warrant. “Allright,” said Kemmler, “I’m ready.”Then his jailer from Buffalo appeared to say good-bye and was invited to eatbreakfast with the condemned man. Just then, two ministers walked in who hadvisited frequently in the fourteen months that Kemmler’s case had draggedthrough the labyrinthine appeals process. They all knelt now on the hard stonefloor and prayed quietly. Breakfast was then served to the subdued group. Beforethey could leave Kemmler’s tiny cell, the Buffalo jailer had the awkward task ofcutting a slit down the seat of Kemmler’s pants so the electric chair’selectrodes would make ideal contact. For the same reason, he also nervouslyshaved a big patch atop the condemned man’s head. As the jailer manipulated therazor, Kemmler spoke to him: “They say I’m afraid to die, but they will findthat I ain’t. I want you to stay right by me, Joe, and see me through this thingand I will promise you that I won’t make any trouble.”34[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts34a] With Kemmler’s hair razed awayon top, Warden Durston descended with him to the electrocution chamber at 6:32A.M. For reasons unknown, the previous day Durston had moved the heavy woodenelectric chair from its original site in an upstairs room to an isolatedbasement room. Now, the dynamo was a thousand feet away in the prison marbleshop, and all communication with its operators would be based on bells.Warden Durston ushered Kemmler into a death chamber incongruously bright withmorning sunlight. Cheerful shafts were streaming through two windows seven feetabove the rough-planked wood floor. This small basement room had once been usedto process new prisoners, who had washed at a sink and bathtub in the cornerbefore donning their “stripes.” Several months earlier, the room had beenpainted a soothing pale gray. Two double-armed gaslight fixtures hung from theceiling. The twenty-five official witnesses, eminent physicians and lawyers, aswell as two select reporters, sat in uneasy silence.“Gentlemen,” said Durston, his voice trembling, “this is William Kemmler. I havewarned him that he has got to die and if he has anything to say he will say it.”The condemned man bowed to the witnesses, all arrayed in a horseshoe of woodenchairs facing the malevolent-looking oversize electric chair. Then Kemmler said,“Gentlemen, I wish you all good luck. I believe I am going to a good place, andI am ready to go. I want only to say that a great deal has been said about methat is untrue. I am bad enough. It is cruel to make me out worse.”35[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts35a] The bearded bantam, his eyesclose set, bowed once again to the witnesses, turned, and removed his gray suitjacket. He began to sit in one of the regular chairs, then realized his mistakeand sat instead in the electric chair. The sun illuminated his sallow beardedface. Warden Durston remembered he had to check that Kemmler’s clothes had holesclear through at the bottom of his back, again for proper attachment ofelectrodes. The shirttail did not. So Durston fished out a scissors andawkwardly cut through the tucked-in shirttail. “Are your suspenders all right?”asked the warden as he put down the scissors.“Yes, all right,” said Kemmler.“Well, then, Bill, you’d better sit down here.”Kemmler matter-of-factly settled back into the electric chair, while the wardenbegan to attach the rear electrode with its suction cup and wet sponges. “Nowtake your time and do it all right, Warden,” instructed Kemmler, cool as couldbe. The witnesses looked at one another in astonishment. “There is no rush,” hecontinued. “I don’t want to take any chances on this thing, you know.”“All right, William,” Durston said grimly. Hands shaking, he was now attachingthe leather masklike headpiece, also designed with a suction piece and wetsponge.As Durston stepped back, Kemmler shook the mask and said in a muffled voice,“Warden, just make that a little tighter. We want everything all right, youknow.”Durston complied and then moved on to strapping in the arms and legs, his handstrembling as he buckled one after the other. “All right,” he said, and steppedback to the threshold of the death chamber. “Is it ready?” Reassured, he turnedtoward Kemmler, now just an ominous leather mask and maze of thick leatherstraps and wires warmed by the streaming sunshine. The freshening breeze outsiderustled the thick ivy and the green grass. The sparrows twittered furiously.Two physicians had come up to inspect the straps. One said, “God bless you,Kemmler, you have done well.” Many of the witnesses had tears in their eyes atthis dreadful scene and now murmured, “You have, Kemmler.” At that moment thedistrict attorney of Buffalo rose from his chair, looking quite green. Excusinghimself, he walked unsteadily toward the closed door to the corridor, opened it,and went out. Later, the other men learned he had fainted in the hallway.Back in the death chamber, the warden conferred briefly with the two physicians,who then sat back down. Durston surveyed his twenty-four tense witnesses and tworeporters and said, “Very well, gentlemen,” then walked toward the room where hewould signal the electricians at the dynamo. The electric lights in there wereon, meaning the dynamo was running. Kemmler’s hands could be seen clutching thewide arms of the electric chair. The bright sunlight lit up the dust motesfloating slowly about. A heavy shade at one window was lifted by the strayingbreezes and fell against the bars. The sparrows in the ivy sang noisily. In theroom, all was tense silence.“Good-bye, William,” said Durston, and there was heard a low click.36[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts36a] The switch was thrown in thefar-off dynamo room. Then, reported The New York Times, Kemmler’s body joltedupright and strained terrifyingly against the straps. He became “as rigid asthough cast in bronze, save for the index finger of the right hand, which closedup so tightly that the nail penetrated the flesh on the first joint and theblood trickled out on the arm of the chair.” When Kemmler’s face turned ashen,the prison physician, who had crept forward from his chair to watch, said, “Heis dead,” leading the warden to signal for the switch to be turned off.Seventeen seconds had passed, and it was now 6:43 A.M. The assembled witnessescollectively exhaled in relief that the awful deed was done and turned theirheads away from Kemmler as Durston detached the electrode from his scalp. Twophysicians leaned forward to examine Kemmler. The other doctors gathered aroundand dented Kemmler’s flesh to judge his state. Dr. Southwick smiled broadly ashe came away from the fresh corpse. “There,” he exclaimed to a knot of witnesseswho had quietly withdrawn to the far end of the chamber, “there is theculmination of ten years’ work and study. We live in a higher civilization fromthis day.”37 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts37a]But the blood was continuing to ooze from Kemmler’s small finger wound. Hisheart still had to be beating. The physicians around the limp figure recoiled asone yelled in horror, “Great God! He is alive!” Another ordered, “Turn on thecurrent.” “See, he breathes,” gasped a third. When Dr. Southwick and the otherswhirled around at these cries, they saw that Kemmler’s body was still limp, buthis chest was heaving up and down. He seemed to be struggling for breath, andfoam was seeping horribly from his masked mouth hole. “For God’s sake, kill himand have it over!” screamed one witness. The Associated Press reporter faintedon the wood floor, and several men carried him to a bench, where they fannedhim. Durston had turned chalk white. He fumbled and reattached the scalpelectrode. As the current flowed anew and Kemmler again went horribly rigid, “anawful odor began to permeate the death chamber.” Kemmler’s hair and skin werebeing visibly singed. A blue flame played briefly behind his neck. His clothescaught fire, but one of the doctors quickly extinguished them. “The stench,”reported the Times, “was unbearable.” After several minutes, the current wasturned off, and as purple spots mottled Kemmler’s hands, arms, and neck, thedoctors again declared him dead. The room reeked of burned meat and feces. Thenauseated witnesses signed the death warrant for Warden Durston and then trailedout into the stone corridors, silent, shaken, several sick, the Erie Countysheriff so distraught that tears trickled down his face.Three hours later, when the doctors had sufficiently recovered to perform anautopsy, they found that rigor mortis had stiffened Kemmler into a permanentsitting position. Examination of the body showed scorch marks wherever theelectrodes and buckles touched the body. Kemmler had been “roasted” as well as apiece of overdone meat. Once the autopsy was complete and numerous organsremoved, Kemmler’s baked corpse was taken and buried at night in the prisoncourtyard with great quantities of quicklime to dissolve all ultimate traces.Southwick excused the bungled electrocution as inevitable on a first try.Otherwise, he was rhapsodic. “I tell you, this is a grand thing, and is destinedto become the system of legal death throughout the world.”38[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts38a] The next day, New York’s manynewspapers devoted page after page to the world’s first official electricalexecution, including every ghastly detail. The New York Times’s front-pageheadline charged, FAR WORSE THAN HANGING; KEMMLER’S DEATH PROVES AN AWFULSPECTACLE. The New-York Daily Tribune subhead read, “Errors andMisunderstandings Made the Execution Painful to the Witnesses.” Thomas Edisonwas quoted as saying, “I have merely glanced over an account of Kemmler’s deathand it was not pleasant reading.”39[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts39a] He blamed the doctors presentfor misplacing electrodes—they should have been attached to the palms ofKemmler’s hands—and general “bungling.” Bourke Cockran said, “It is a sort ofghastly triumph for me. The experts against me on the trial figured it all outsuch that such a shocking thing was impossible and yet it has just happened….After Kemmler’s awful punishment no other state will adopt the electricalexecution law.”40 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts40a]As for George Westinghouse, he said, “I do not care to talk about it. It hasbeen a brutal affair. They could have done it better with an axe. My predictionshave been verified. The public will lay the blame where it belongs and it willnot be on us. I regard the manner of the killing as a complete vindicator of allour claims.”41 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts41a] Almost fortyyears later, Nikola Tesla still abhorred the electric chair, calling it “anapparatus monstrously unsuitable, for the poor wretches are not dispatched in amerciful manner but literally roasted alive…. An individual under suchconditions, while wholly bereft of the consciousness of the lapse of time,retains a keen sense of pain, and a minute of agony is equivalent to thatthrough all eternity.”42 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts42a]Suspicion was rife that Westinghouse had somehow managed to mastermind thisbotched execution. As for Harold Brown, one of the most ardent and combativeofficers in the War of the Electric Currents, he was strangely absent from allthe bitter aftermath and hullabaloo. He disappeared from public sight, never tobe heard from again."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_014_r1.jpg]A formal portrait of George Westinghouse, 1906CHAPTER 91891: “Fear Everywhere of Worse to Come”November 15, 1890, dawned crisp and azure in Manhattan, one of those deliciousfall Saturdays where the very air shimmers sweetly, full of life’s promise andyet tempered by autumnal tristesse. The money men in their mansions on upperFifth and Madison, settling into their breakfasts, knew better than anyone thenation’s greatness, its commercial promise, its phenomenal wealth. The steadywaves of immigrants flowing in through Castle Garden and then washing out acrossthe land had pushed America’s population up to a mighty sixty-three million,according to the recent census. Politicians had taken to boasting that theUnited States was now a “billion dollar” country. It was, in fact, far richerthan that, thanks to its relentless can-do commercial spirit and the recklessambition of men like Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse. In the postbellumUnited States, the national wealth had soared to $65 billion, more than theaccumulated holdings of all the aristocrats and commercial classes of GreatBritain, Germany, and Russia combined. By 1890, in America, nearly $40 billionwas invested in land and buildings, $9 billion in the sprawling network ofrailroads, and $4 billion in manufacturing and mining.But as the New York money men unfolded their daily newspapers that glisteningNovember morning, there was only visceral dread. For weeks the rumors of a bigLondon investment firm on the brink of collapse had been creeping quietly aboutthe chaotic floor of the New York Stock Exchange, multiplying, growing moresinister, more fantastic, infesting the always volatile atmosphere withsensations of doom. Now here, today, the worst of the whispered disasters wasopenly aired. On the World’s front page, for all its vast readership to see, wasthe story in public print: DEPRESSED BY RUMORS, WALL STREET AGITATED BY REPORTSFROM LONDON, THE BARING BROTHERS, IT IS SAID, INVOLVED IN THE RECENT TROUBLES.As the World so rightly observed, “When London trembles, the tremor is felt theworld over. Therefore New York quaked.” English investors leery of Americansilver policy had been flocking to the bonds known as “Argentines,” eager toearn the easy riches of that far-off South American nation, but a revolution hadnow rendered worthless all those considerable investments.When the financiers converged on their elegant Wall Street offices that finefall morning, the lurking skeletal rumors solidified into monstrous and hideousfacts. As The New York Times reported in the lead story of its fat Sundayedition, Saturday morning had brought the bleak and mind-boggling news thatBaring Brothers & Company, “the greatest banking house of all the world, a firmwhose business connections have extended for a century or more to the uttermostlimits of the habitable globe [whose] … signature has stood always andeverywhere for an absolute guarantee,” was indeed tottering on the brink ofbankruptcy. “This confession was sensational beyond anything that Wall Streethad even suspected or dreamed of.” One New York Times financial writerelaborated on the nightmarish news: “If the solvency of the Bank of England hadbeen questioned, it could not carry a more severe shock.” The ensuing daysfeatured placating stories about the brilliant rescue of Barings and itsreorganization and soothing assertions about the general good health of Americanbusiness.But the stunning and ominous collapse of Barings was not so easily dismissed.The American banks of the Gilded Age were not unlike Potemkin villages: augustand solid on the face of it, hushed and impressive marble-columned temples tomammon. But behind that stolid, expensive architecture flapped flimsy financialstructures, liable to collapse under the slightest economic ill wind. And thecataclysm of Barings was a gale-force reminder of how dependent American financewas on foreign investors. Despite the good face the newspapers put on thematter, every businessman knew in his gut that the Barings debacle would take atoll. Several smaller banking houses failed, “spreading everywhere fear of worseto come.”1 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts1a] In this laissez-faireera before meaningful bank legislation, many decades before stringent federalbank regulation and individual deposit insurance, no authority or institutionbacked the banks, and the merest whiff of financial bad weather understandablysent jittery depositors to besiege their own branch and retrieve whatever cashthey could. These panicked runs set off a chain of inevitable destabilization.Even before depositors began jostling and lining up, some banks began calling intheir loans, knowing that only large stacks of greenbacks would reassure theirclientele. And so, the economic disasters rippled out from each affected bank,sending fear seeping inexorably deeper into the American financial psyche.George Westinghouse had just gone up to his new Lenox, Massachusetts, countryretreat to settle a real estate matter when his Pittsburgh office flashed anurgent telegraphic alert of the Barings catastrophe. Just ten days earlier,Westinghouse and his wife, Marguerite, whose health depended on regular doses ofthe pine-scented Berkshires, had finally moved into their turreted and gabledGilded Age “cottage,” Erskine Manor. Surrounded by acres of elegant greensward,old shade trees, and brooding evergreens, the Westinghouses, their young son,and many relatives and guests could sit on the wide covered porches of therustic new mansion and pleasantly contemplate the ever changing moods of therolling Berkshire Hills. Two years earlier, Walter Uptegraff had become part ofthe household, serving as a full-time secretary, family accountant, and generalconfidant. Old Mrs. Westinghouse, eighty-one, whose late-life passion was thecard game whist, had also come to live with her son, while brothers and sisters,young nieces and nephews, often stayed for months. Formal dinner parties werethe routine in the Berkshires, as they were in Pittsburgh.“After the guests had gone and the family had retired,” recalled Uptegraff,George Westinghouse “would go to his study where he would work on his inventionsuntil one or two o’clock in the morning. During these quiet hours he alwaysliked to have someone with him (myself) to whom he could open his inmost selfwithout restraint; to explain what he was trying to accomplish by showing thedrawings he was working on; to compliment the listener by inviting suggestions.He required but four or five hours of sleep and would come down to an earlybreakfast bursting with energy, eager to get at the day’s work as quickly aspossible.”2 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts2a] That fall of 1890,George Westinghouse had all reason to be enjoying his sylvan new estate andreveling in the phenomenal success of his substantial industrial companies,especially his newest and most cherished: the fast-growing electric company,which was finally beginning to fulfill his Olympian dreams.Just the previous month, the Electrical Engineer wrote, “Reports from all overthe country show that this year is the greatest the electrical industry has everknown…. [The Westinghouse] works are now being operated at their utmost capacityday and night.”3 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts3a] Despite Edison’swar against alternating current, the month of September 1890, soon after WilliamKemmler’s botched electrocution, had been a banner sales month for theWestinghouse Electric Company’s alternating current central stations (operatingincandescent lights). In October, the city of Baltimore, Maryland, had ordered a6,000-light AC system; Elmira, New York, put in for 1,500 lights, as didNebraska’s state capital, Lincoln. And these were just three of many orders.Westinghouse had also expanded into arc lights and electric streetcars, andthose departments were equally booming. In four short years, since it wasestablished in early 1886 as George Westinghouse’s fifth industrial enterprise,total annual sales at the Westinghouse Electric Company had soared from $150,000to more than $4 million.The telegraphed news of the Barings collapse ended any sense of well-earnedsatisfaction. Westinghouse quickly packed, and he and Uptegraff got in a buggyto the train station to board his private railcar back to Pittsburgh. All thebig electric companies were financially shaky, for they were fast-expanding,capital-intensive businesses in an era when capital was hard to come by. Before1890, the New York Stock Exchange, like other exchanges around the country,listed only railroad stocks. So raising adequate long-term capital was vexing.Many local electric firms and towns made initial payment partly in cash and alsoby giving the Edison or Westinghouse companies stock in their new local lightingcompanies. The previous March, Edison president Henry Villard complainedbitterly to Drexel, Morgan that Edison Electric was growing so fast, its workingcapital was “entirely inadequate. Instead of one million, several millions areimperatively wanted to meet the demands of the several manufacturingdepartments.”4 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts4a] Westinghouse facedexactly the same problem, and he knew better than anyone the parlous state ofhis indebtedness as his train steamed through Pennsylvania’sstrike-and-violence-plagued coalfields and past the still recovering hamletssavaged more than a year earlier by the fearful Johnstown flood.The next morning, Westinghouse strode into the imposing nine-story WestinghouseBuilding on Pittsburgh’s Penn Avenue, a street notable for the presence oftrees, wearing his usual somber, vested suit and high collar and carrying hisever-present umbrella. He knew all too well that he needed at least $500,000 incash to pay his immediate creditors. The company’s current assets totaled $2.5million, its short-term liabilities $3 million. Before the Barings bankruptcy,closing this gap would have been accomplished quietly. Unlike Edison, who hadfrom the first been linked to the powerful Morgan financial forces on WallStreet (though they were generally far too cautious and tightfisted), GeorgeWestinghouse had amassed capital as needed by personal appeals to friends andexisting stockholders. Biographer Henry Prout explained, “He had such animpelling personality and such a remarkable power for effectively presenting hiscase that he frequently secured large sums of money from men of wealth.”5[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts5a] The majority of Westinghousestockholders were leading citizens of Pittsburgh who had invested and prosperedas the indomitable industrialist and entrepreneur created one flourishingcompany after another.In those grim November days of 1890, the economy was souring swiftly, even asWestinghouse grappled with his money woes head-on. He and his board of directorsappealed immediately to their own stockholders to raise the desperately needed$500,000, by doubling the electric company’s capital stock and offering sharesat a 20 percent discount. But fear was in the air even as Pittsburgh wasbecoming the nation’s greatest producer of steel, recounted Francis Leupp, and“general commercial conditions were so depressing that the response fell farshort of what he had hoped.”6 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts6a] Adelegation of employees from the original Westinghouse Electric Companyappeared, offering to work for half pay until the crisis was solved. Their bosswas deeply touched, but he declined. Next, Westinghouse convened an informalmeeting of Pittsburgh’s leading bankers, men “who had profited by the businessbrought them through the industries he had built up in the city or had attractedthither from outside.”7 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts7a] Forcefuland charming as always, he stood before them and confidently reviewed for thesepotential rescuers the excellent health of his seven other companies and, mostrelevant, the large future prospects of the at-risk electrical company. Alltold, his eight companies were worth $23 million and earned $16.5 million, ofwhich an impressive $4.2 million was profit. The bonded debt was just over $1million. Accounts receivable, however, stood at more than $6 million, andmaterials on hand were an unproductive $2.5 million.Ironically, the Westinghouse Electric Company had just posted its best yearever. Westinghouse fervently believed that “in spite of its temporaryembarrassment, [it] was destined for a career of unparalleled prosperity.”Westinghouse had, after all, just begun to light up and power the world. Everyday, cities all over America were sending in orders, not just for light, but forelectric streetcars. Once Westinghouse Electric got its elusive AC inductionmotor working, the sales potential was stupendous. And then there was the restof the globe. Had not Westinghouse already installed 750 incandescent lights inHavana, Cuba? And was the company not active in Canton, China?Now Westinghouse, his large walrus mustache bristling, asked these men, whocertainly had grown rich (or merely richer) through his eight companies, to seehim through in his hour of need. So certain was he of the solidity and future ofthe electric company, he declared himself prepared to put up his own belovedHomewood mansion, Solitude, along with several other adjacent suburban parcels,as collateral for the half-million loan he so urgently needed. The assembledbankers murmured in a friendly manner and agreed to appoint a committee toreview the books.On December 10, the Westinghouse Electric Company publicly stated that due tothe “difficulty in raising new money … owing to the stringency in the moneymarket,” the board of directors would raise the required $500,000 by creatingand selling preferred stock. Over the next two weeks, thirty Pittsburghbusinessmen and seventeen banks, many having been part of the friendly grouppresent a few weeks earlier, subscribed from $2,000 to $35,000 each to theneeded $500,000, which then entitled them to stock, even as WestinghouseElectric stock, originally valued at $50, plummeted to $13 a share. The daybefore Christmas, the Electrical Engineer reported the heartening news that“only minor details are to be looked after before a deal is closed. This willput the electric company—certainly a money-making concern when properlymanaged—on a sound footing and it would seem that the improvement noted in thestock to-day reflects those changes.”8[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts8a]The phrase properly managed reflected an ominous turn of events. BelievingWestinghouse cornered, one of the bankers saw an easy chance to gain partialcontrol of this highly valuable industrial property. He said to his colleagues,“Mr. Westinghouse wastes so much on experimentation, and pays so liberally forwhatever he wishes in the way of service and patent rights, that we are taking apretty large risk if we give him a free hand with the fund he has asked us toraise. We ought at least to know what he is doing with our money.”9[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts9a] When the bankers demanded a voicein management, Westinghouse explained in a genial and pleasant way that this wasimpossible. He had always run his own companies, they were flourishing—but forthis immediate need to pay off electric creditors—and he had no intention ofbeing second-guessed or told what to do. The two sides went back and forth atsome length, until Westinghouse said he must have an answer: Either they wereproviding the loan no strings attached or they were not. The bankers looked atone another and said, no, they must insist on naming a general manager.“Realizing what this meant to him, they waited almost breathlessly to note itseffect,” wrote Francis Leupp. “To their astonishment, instead of beingstaggered, he rose with a smile, remarking, ‘Well, thank God I know the worst atlast!’” It was not Westinghouse, imperturbable as ever, who was shaken, but theoverreaching bankers. Westinghouse told several jokes, bade the silent bankersgood day, and left the room. They had just witnessed the deservedly famousWestinghouse courage. As his old friend and biographer Henry Prout explained,Westinghouse was a great one for consulting others, “then he made up his ownmind, and nothing milder than an earthquake could budge him. We have seen himsitting like a rock, serene, gentle, and unmoved when every member of the boardof directors was against him. Whether he was determined or just obstinatedepends upon your point of view.”10[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts10a] Westinghouse had been right fartoo often when those he judged pusillanimous had been wrong. Why should he stoptrusting his own formidable instincts?That very Friday night, as a snowstorm engulfed the eastern seaboard, GeorgeWestinghouse again boarded the Glen Eyre, his private railway car complete withsleeping quarters, dining room, kitchen, and office, and as the snow rapidlycarpeted the countryside, he steamed toward Gotham, the heart of America’sbrittle financial system. By the time they came across on the PennsylvaniaRailroad ferry from Jersey City the next morning, the snow had stopped fallingand the Hudson was bobbing with chunks of floating ice. The city looked festiveswathed in holiday greens, and its usual noise and bustle were muffled by thethick mantle of clean, sparkling snow. But the pretty winter scenes were merelyirksome to the cursing horsecar operators, who found draymen and their big teamsalso driving on the cleared horsecar rails, the only usable portion of thesnowed-in city streets. Few avenues or side streets were passable, even asshopkeepers and “useful men” were gamely shoveling aside the snow. Far uptown,spirits were more frolicsome, as hundreds of sleighs glided colorfully alongbehind handsome horses, bells jangling, all thronging the uptown avenues andCentral Park drives. One “dude” had three big bays pulling his elegant getup,each horse trimmed smartly in fur and prancing plumes. But whether New Yorkerscursed the snow or reveled in it, Westinghouse was embarked on a far moreserious mission: the seeking of New York money. This would be just the first ofnumerous sallies into the magnificent marbled edifices of Wall Street, thenation’s gilded financial heart. Westinghouse had never before met many of thenation’s big money men, but they certainly knew of him, and he had his young andbrilliant New York lawyer, Paul D. Cravath, to smooth his way. The survival ofWestinghouse’s best-loved and most promising company, the fulfillment of hisvery electrical dreams, was now at stake.Back in Pittsburgh, where the fresh snow was promptly glazed squalid gray withsoot from a hundred belching chimneys, the bankers smugly assumed that it wouldjust be a matter of time before Westinghouse returned ready to proceed on theirterms. When this had not transpired by mid-January, and Westinghouse wastelegraphing back from Manhattan and describing his prospects as “rosy,” thePittsburgh bankers and businessmen began returning the $520,000 in uncashedrescue checks. Nor did they share Westinghouse’s perennial rosy optimism. TheNew York Times reported that in Westinghouse’s headquarters city, “financiersand stockholders now favor the appointment of a receiver for the WestinghouseElectric Company.” Meanwhile, the first of the creditors filed lawsuits—one asmall bank seeking $2,000, another a local steel company after its $800. Thehuman jackals were beginning to circle.In Manhattan, Westinghouse had found a possible savior in August Belmont, sonand partner of the fabled founder of one of Wall Street’s most respectedinvestment houses. August Belmont & Company was a major power, for it served asthe American branch of the legendary Rothschild banks. The Belmonts were strongDemocrats and famous horsemen. On January 4, 1891, Electrical World carried astatement from the Westinghouse Electric Company describing the new rescue plan(it made no mention as yet of New York bankers), which entailed selling a newblock of preferred stock, having existing shareholders turn in 40 percent oftheir old stock and accept less valuable new stock, and paying as many creditorsas possible with new preferred stock. It listed various other steps taken torestore fiscal health, including “elimination of doubtful values and the bookvalue of patents.” George Westinghouse was described as “now devoting himself tothe placing of this stock and is very hopeful of success.”This story only obliquely hinted at one of the many sticking points for theWestinghouse rescue: Tesla’s lucrative AC patent royalty deal. GeorgeWestinghouse was well-known for having a soft spot for inventors, alwaysremembering his many early rebuffs when trying to sell his air brake. Thegeneral feeling was that he was too generous. The New York bankers felt thatWestinghouse’s championing of Tesla’s as-yet-unworkable alternating currentmotor was one more contributing cause in the company’s woes. The industrialisthad paid $20,000 in cash to Nikola Tesla, then $50,000 in notes. He had laid outyet more big money trying to develop Tesla’s AC induction motor and the rest ofhis system, paying the Serbian inventor handsome consulting fees. And all thishad come to very little. The top Westinghouse engineers had not cared for Teslaor his system. They had balked when he was in Pittsburgh, and were stillbalking, at designing a system that operated on the 60-cycle frequency Teslainsisted was necessary. The industry was in its infancy, but already there werevarious established cycles for electrical equipment, and 60 cycles was not oneof the common frequencies. Tesla had run into the problem that even if onesystem (his) was better, sheer inertia, habit, and the cost of the new couldcombine to thwart technological improvement. The hard truth was thatWestinghouse had spent a great deal of money and did not seem even close tomaking Tesla’s system or his AC induction motor work on a commercial basis. Norwas that all. Westinghouse also had paid sizable legal fees to defend his Teslapatents against all sorts of interloping engineers and inventors claimingpriority. Westinghouse had sunk large sums into Tesla, and now his money-shortcompany was imperiled.Nikola Tesla had returned disillusioned from Pittsburgh in the fall of 1889,just over a year earlier, lingered briefly in Manhattan, and then sailed off toFrance to visit the Paris Exposition, with its sprawling and marvelouselectrical exhibits. From the still wondrous City of Light, he would travel eastto Austria-Hungary to reunite briefly with his many sisters and their EasternOrthodox priest husbands and to comfort his dying mother. Tesla was an immigrantsuccess story now, one of the self-made Gilded Age rich, thanks to his ACpatents. The inventor’s ocean voyage back to Europe was a luxurious contrast tohis penniless seaboard arrival five years earlier. In Paris, le tout monde couldtalk of nothing but the soaring Eiffel Tower and the amazing American wizardThomas Edison, whose multilingual phonographs dazzled all visitors to theexposition’s huge Edison display. Edison, also in Paris, was in excellentspirits, relishing the great acclaim that greeted his every public appearanceand his own ascension into the ranks of the American millionaires.That summer, Edison had happily allowed Edison Electric president HenryVillard—onetime crack Civil War correspondent, the Union Pacific builder who haddriven in the golden spike, U.S. representative for big German banks, andlongtime Edison investor—to reorganize the Edison Electric Light Company and itsvarious manufacturing entities into Edison General Electric, capitalized at $12million. The Drexel, Morgan investors were very handsomely rewarded—theiroriginal $1 million investments were now deemed worth $2.7 million in Edison GEstock. Edison emerged flush with $1.75 million in stock and cash for themanufacturing shops he had created. Wrote Edison gratefully to Villard, “I havebeen under a desperate strain for money for 22 years, and when I sold out, oneof the greatest inducements was the sum of cash received, so as to free my mindfrom financial stress, and thus enable me to go ahead in the technical field.”11[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts11a] Edison GE president E. H.Johnson enthused to Edison, “We shall speedily have the biggest Edisonorganization in the world with abundant capital when goodbye Westinghouse etal.”12 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts12a] By 1889, Edison GeneralElectric had indeed become a major American corporation, employing threethousand men in its three main shops and bringing in revenues of $7 million ayear, with profits of almost $700,000. During this reorganization, Villard hadalso sold $4 million in new Edison GE stock, mostly to his German-backed NorthAmerican company and to the Morgan group. So Edison had every reason to feelbuoyant during his triumphant 1889 Parisian visit.Tesla’s own European sojourn involved meetings with numerous eminentelectricians, and as he sailed back into New York Harbor in the late fall of1889, he was afire with new electrical projects and plans. He established acommodious and well-equipped laboratory on the fourth floor of 33-35 South FifthAvenue (today West Broadway), a run-down commercial block just west of CityHall. Edison had decamped to the countryside and his magnificent West Orangelab, while the Edison General Electric corporate offices were moved to 16 BroadStreet, next to the Sub-Treasury Building, in the more logical Wall Streetdistrict, leaving 65 Fifth Avenue to serve as an elaborate and fashionableshowroom of electrical lighting wonders, ablaze with chandeliers and such.When Tesla returned to Manhattan, he was the picture of European elegance, atall, slender man in the prime of life, impeccably dressed in the finesthand-tailored Parisian styles right down to his cane, spats, and soft-leathershoes. He was well able to afford his indulgence of tossing out his fawn-coloredkid gloves and silk handkerchiefs after a week of use. Many who met him noticedthe intense blue of his eyes and the size of his hands and their unusually longthumbs. Tesla had also acquired a taste for the convenience of luxury hotelliving while residing in Pittsburgh. After inspecting numerous Manhattanhostelries, he elected to live in the Astor House, Gotham’s first luxury hotel.Situated on Broadway and Vesey, it was conveniently near his lab. He began todine nightly at Delmonico’s, America’s most famous restaurant, a gustatorytemple that for six decades had served exquisite French cuisine and wines. Teslapreferred the mutedly elegant uptown Delmonico’s at Fifth Avenue and 26thStreet, located across from the civilized greenery of the handsome and leafyMadison Square Garden Park, a pleasant refuge from Manhattan’s tumult, an oasisof spreading elms, graveled paths, statuary, and fountains.As a regular solo customer of Delmonico’s, the polite and gracious inventor hadlet the highly trained staff know that he liked to have eighteen pristinenapkins in a stack at his table. Very discreetly, Tesla used them to wipe thegerms off each piece of heavy silverware, sparkling china, and crystal stemwarebefore he partook of the chef’s many delights. Tesla’s germ phobia had developedafter a fellow scientist allowed him to observe through a microscope the manynormally invisible creatures inhabiting unboiled water. Tesla would laterexplain, “If you would watch only for a few minutes the horrible creatures,hairy and ugly beyond anything you can conceive, tearing each other up with thejuices diffusing throughout the water—you would never again drink a drop ofunboiled or unsterilized water.”13[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts13a] So Tesla was ever vigilant inlimiting his exposure to these vile microscopic bugs.Tesla’s new wealth and the luxurious lifestyle he now adopted with such relishin no way affected his complete obsession and devotion to his electrical dreams.All through 1890, even as he prided himself on his exquisitely tailored clothesand daily savored his excellent Delmonico’s dinners, he still labored his usualseven days a week in his laboratory, working through the night and retreating tothe Astor House in the wee hours for five hours’ rest—reportedly only two ofthese being actual sleep. During the day at his lab, Tesla could hear the loudrumbling of the passing elevated, spewing sparks and cinders on the unwarybelow, while down on the grungy street lined with ash barrels and piles ofrefuse arose the angry shouts of the teamsters and their massive teams of horsesnegotiating their way to and from the nearby wharves. Tesla had one or twohelpers and sometimes his partner, Alfred Brown, to work with him and assist.Sadly, his old friend and colleague Szigety had died while still a young man.Despite the disillusionment with his own Westinghouse experience, Teslamaintained cordial relations with the firm and remained hopeful that theproblems with his AC system and induction motor would finally be overcome. Heoffered whatever advice he could to the Westinghouse Electric engineers, visitedfrom time to time when he was picking up special equipment for his lab, and sentalong possible clients. He was most distressed when he heard in late 1890 thatall development work on his motor had been halted.Tesla would have been well aware in early 1891, as was the whole electricalfraternity, that Westinghouse Electric was in severe financial straits. Soperhaps he was not surprised when Westinghouse appeared at his fourth-floorlaboratory, where Tesla was making amazing advances with high-frequencyresearch. The month that Barings practically went belly-up, setting off thewhole Westinghouse crisis, Tesla had managed to light up protofluorescent lampsof his own invention using only ambient electrostatic waves. These unique lightbulbs had no filaments, only gases that responded to the highly chargedelectrical atmosphere, and were connected to no electrical wires. WhenWestinghouse came to Tesla’s lab, wearing as always his dark formal vested suit,he got right down to his unfortunate task. Ever a mixture of bluntness andcharm, he elaborated upon the crisis and asked Tesla to repudiate his contractand forgo his patent royalties. Tesla described this critical episode in his ownlife to his first biographer thus:“‘Your decision,’ said the Pittsburgh magnate, ‘determines the fate of theWestinghouse Company.’“‘Suppose I should refuse to give up my contract; what would you do then?’“‘In that event you would have to deal with the bankers, for I would no longerhave any power in the situation,’ Westinghouse replied.“‘And if I give up the contract you will save your company and retain control soyou can proceed with your plans to give my polyphase system to the world?’“‘I believe your polyphase system is the greatest discovery in the field ofelectricity,’ Westinghouse explained. ‘It was my efforts to give it to the worldthat brought on the present difficulty, but I intend to continue, no matter whathappens, to proceed with my original plans to put the country on an alternatingcurrent basis.’“‘Mr. Westinghouse,’ said Tesla, drawing himself up to his full height of sixfeet two inches and beaming down on the Pittsburgh magnate who was himself a bigman, ‘you have been my friend, you believed in me when others had no faith; youwere brave enough to go ahead and pay me … when others lacked courage; yousupported me when even your own engineers lacked vision to see the big thingsahead that you and I saw; you have stood by me as a friend. The benefits thatwill come to civilization from my polyphase system mean more to me than themoney involved. Mr. Westinghouse, you will save your company so that you candevelop my inventions. Here is your contract and here is my contract—I will tearboth of them to pieces and you will no longer have any troubles from myroyalties. Is that sufficient?’”14[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts14a] And so, ever the romantic, theidealist, the brilliant dreamer of elysian electrical dreams, Tesla grandlysacrificed those possible future profits to Westinghouse’s own electricsurvival.Was Tesla the major cause of Westinghouse’s financial woes? Probably not.Westinghouse was well-known for being generous to young inventors of all sorts,but he had also purchased numerous businesses that ate up capital and were notyet generating much income. He was always an enthusiastic litigator on manyfronts, especially patent infringement, and his long-running and still ongoingbattle with Edison over the incandescent bulb had racked up huge legal fees. ButTesla was certainly a factor and just one of many savings the financiersdemanded. Moreover, at this stage of his burgeoning career, Tesla probably felthe could well afford to be magnanimous with Westinghouse, who was struggling topreserve his electrical empire. For the Serbian inventor’s own deep delvingsinto the mysteries of high-frequency electricity were just beginning and alreadywere yielding all manner of fascinating secrets. Tesla, along with his ferventand loyal admirers, including editor T. Commerford Martin and Professor WilliamAnthony, was firmly convinced that his AC system and motor were just the richbeginning, the mere debut of many magnificent and hugely lucrative inventions:Electricity was in its infancy, and Tesla was destined to be its greatestexplorer, unveiling for the world the inner workings of a universe pulsing withinvisible energy.As Tesla advanced into more and more remote electrical terrain—the unknown peaksand valleys of very high frequency alternating current—T. C. Martin again urgedhim to publish his findings and then present his new work in another lecture.The rumors were rampant among the electrical fraternity about Tesla’s doings:hard-to-credit tales of wireless lights weirdly glowing in Tesla’s laboratoryall through the night or talk that the strange young inventor was taking tens ofthousands of volts through his body, standing there smiling and unharmed as heallowed crackling electrical flames to engulf him, like some medieval Serbiansaint surrounded by a pulsing silvery blue aura. Tesla was harking back to thelong-ago electrostatic shows of Dangling Boys. Martin was as important andinfluential as ever in the electrical field, having jumped ship from theElectrical World in early 1890, after squabbling with the publisher, to run theElectrical Engineer, which thereby immediately became the leading journal.Martin, always debonair with his huge handlebar mustachio and dashing Britishcharm, cajoled the ever reluctant Tesla to emerge from the long nights at hislab and share with the world his rare and strange discoveries. Finally, NikolaTesla agreed to speak on May 20, 1891, at the Wednesday night meeting of theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers, the same prestigious forum where hisfirst talk had catapulted him to fame among his peers.Again the meeting was held at Columbia College up on Madison Avenue in theschool’s electrical workshop. Tesla stood up on a stage, his apparatus arrayedon a wooden table before him. Many of the nation’s leading electricians crowdedin, anxious to see what Tesla had got up to now. Was there anything to all theodd stories? The place was abuzz with excitement. T. C. Martin’s coeditor,Joseph Wetzler, was in that eager crowd and wrote for readers of Harper’sWeekly: “Mr. Tesla held his audience in complete captivity of attention andadmiration for over three hours.”15[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts15a] Tesla explained to his raptaudience that what he had been investigating in a broad sense was how to unleashthe infinite energy “nature has stored up in the universe.” He had constructedin his downtown laboratory “alternating current machines capable of giving morethan two million reversals of current per minute” and then had beenexperimenting with them to investigate a range of questions. But for hisColumbia talk, he would confine himself to just one topic, “the production of apractical and efficient source of light.” Tesla had developed a series ofpowerful AC machines that generated great electrostatic waves—or thrusts—thatproduced varying kinds of “discharges,” eerie and luminous electricalemanations, ranging from the most delicate and threadlike fans to whirlingpinwheels to great spurts of streaming, glowing flames that spread about a wholemachine, like an unearthly corona.Speaking in his high, nervous, but perfect (accented) English, Teslademonstrated his numerous different electrostatic machines and explained thespecific kinds of light each produced. Tesla had also been experimenting withnew kinds of light bulbs that operated on completely new principles. “It cannotbe denied that the present methods [of illumination], though they were brilliantadvances, are very wasteful,” he explained. “Some better methods must beinvented, some more perfect apparatus devised.” He then amazed his audience byshowing a light bulb with a single looped filament. He then set that filament tospinning even as it was glowing brightly. But Nikola Tesla’s showstoppers, hismost amazing wonders, were the long-rumored bulbs without any filament thatindeed glowed as brightly as any incandescent bulb and yet were unattached toany wire or machine. The tall, pale Mr. Tesla in his slender swallowtail coatheld them aloft in his hand, somewhat like the Statue of Liberty, and theyshone. He explained how it was that his whole laboratory operated using justsuch magical lights, protofluorescents. “I suspend a sheet of metal a distancefrom the ceiling on insulating coils and connect it to one of the terminals ofthe induction coil, the other terminal being preferably connected to the ground.An exhausted tube [one with a vacuum] may then be carried in the hand anywherebetween the sheets or placed anywhere, even a certain distance beyond them; itremains always luminous.” Thomas Edison’s proudest invention was hisincandescent bulb. And indeed, it had lit up the world as he had promised. NowNikola Tesla was declaring Edison’s technology passé, obsolete, a primitive andinefficient solution that deserved to be replaced.Outside in the late spring evening, it had long since grown dark. For threehours, Nikola Tesla had mesmerized his well-educated audience of electricianswith his demonstrations of completely new electrical effects, machines, andlight bulbs. As he completed his lecture, he said, “Among many observations, Ihave selected only those which I thought most likely to interest you. The fieldis wide and completely unexplored, and at every step a new truth is gleaned, anovel fact observed. How far the results here borne out are capable of practicalapplications will be decided in the future. As regards the production of light,some results already reached are encouraging and make me confident in assertingthat the practical solution of the problem lies in that direction…. Thepossibilities for research are so vast that even the most reserved must feelsanguine of the future.”Tesla understood that many branded him a “visionary” for his deep belief that intime energy would be easily extracted from the universe around us. But hepointed out, “We are whirling through endless space with an inconceivable speed,all around us everything is spinning, everything is moving, everywhere isenergy. There must be some way of availing ourselves of this energy moredirectly. Then, with the light obtained from the medium, with the power derivedfrom it, with every form of energy obtained without effort, from the store everinexhaustible, humanity will advance with giant strides. The mere contemplationof those magnificent possibilities expands our minds, strengthens our hopes andfills our hearts with supreme delight.”16[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts16a]With that Tesla bowed modestly and stood beaming as the audience rose to itsfeet and thunderously clapped its amazement at what they had heard and seen.Electrical World declared it “one of the most brilliant and fascinating lecturesthat it has ever been our fortune to attend.”17[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts17a] Joseph Wetzler, awed andastounded, proclaimed in Harper’s Weekly that with this second lecture of hiscareer, Nikola Tesla had “at one bound placed himself abreast of such men asEdison, Brush, Elihu Thomson, and Alexander Graham Bell.” Was it any wonder thatTesla so generously gave up all rights to AC royalties when he and his admirersbelieved he was well on his way to unleashing in completely novel ways theenergy of the whole universe for man’s needs? A mere decade hence, AC might wellbe as outmoded as DC.As May turned to June, Westinghouse’s determined quest for money continued. Outin West Orange, Thomas Edison might well have gained great pleasure fromWestinghouse’s financial woes in that grim spring of 1891, were he not in muchthe same predicament. Several months after his agreeable autumn of continentaladulation in 1889, Edison was writing the ever charming, ever busy EdisonGeneral Electric president, Henry Villard, that the previous summer’sreorganization (which had made him a millionaire) was not, after all, such agreat arrangement. Before, Edison wrote, he had “an income of $250,000 per year,from which I paid easily my Laboratory expenses. This income by theconsolidation was reduced to $85,000, which is insufficient to run theLaboratory…. I am placed in such a position that my active connection with theLighting business costs half my time … [and] has produced absolutediscouragement.”18 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts18a]Villard was well aware from his previous efforts to merge Edison’s company withrival firms that Thomas Edison bristled at such talk. The inventor had angrilydismissed the notion that mergers (and ensuing sharing of contested patents)would solve any problems by asserting, “The Company with the best and cheapestmachinery will do the business, patents or no patents. Fact is, Mr. Villard,that all electric machinery is entirely too high now. These high prices hurt thebusiness.” As for merging with Thomson-Houston, that was absolute anathema.Edison had already denounced its men for “having boldly appropriated andinfringed every patent we use.”19[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts19a] Edison’s AC war againstWestinghouse made the Pittsburgh magnate and his firm an unlikely merger mate.Moreover, Edison fervently believed that were he to combine with any of hishated rivals, his inventive fertility would dry up. “If you make the coalitionmy usefulness as an inventor is gone. My services wouldn’t be worth a penny. Ican only invent under powerful incentive. No competition means no invention.”20[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts20a]In the wake of the Barings debacle, however, Villard had seen his German-fundedNorth American Bank, source of much Edison GE electrical capital, collapse.Moreover, Edison now held only 10 percent of his own company’s stock. So aboutthe same time that Westinghouse began desperately seeking Wall Street money,Villard once again began secretly talking to Charles Coffin, the former shoesalesman whose business brilliance had steadily forged Thomson-Houston into amajor electrical power. Villard was still intent upon a merger of the two firms,with an eye to ending the draining and costly patent wars (sixty lawsuits werewending their expensive way through various courts) and to gaining access toThomson-Houston’s well-developed AC lighting system at a time when Edisonsalesmen were clamoring for AC. And while the incandescent light bulb patent wasstill on appeal in the courts, the general feeling was that Edison would win.Thomson-Houston would very much need the rights to that all-important bulb.Then, of course, there were the obvious advantages of size and scale.Yet nothing could proceed without the blessing of J. P. Morgan, who had in thepast decade become one of the most powerful financial figures on Wall Streetand, hence, in America. As Morgan sat in his office smoking monstrous Havanacigars, busily and efficiently combining what he viewed as wastefullycompetitive railroads into “trusts,” he provoked the growing ire of thosedisgusted by an arrogant plutocracy of unchecked big money. But in February of1891, J. P. Morgan could see no purpose in an Edison merger with Thomson-Houstonas proposed by Coffin’s Boston financiers. “The Edison system,” Morgan wrotethem, “affords us all the use of time and capital that I think desirable to usein one channel. If, as would seem to be the case, you have the control of theThomson-Houston, we will see which makes the best result. I do not see myselfhow the two things can be brought together, certainly not on any such basis aswas talked about a year or more ago.”21[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts21a] Villard gamely kept in touchwith Coffin but held out little hope for the time being.Charles Coffin tried on numerous occasions to woo Westinghouse into a merger oftheir two firms. Clarence W. Barron, a talented financial journalist, happenedto stop by Westinghouse’s factory when the magnate was in an irritable mood, andwith one mention of Coffin, out poured a blunt Westinghouse diatribe: “Mr.Coffin has a very swelled head. He talks about making [his] … Company biggerthan the Standard Oil Company…. Coffin will make a man about ten differentpropositions in ten minutes. I have had many interviews with him. I suppose youknow how he takes people into his inside room and then locks the door on them,so as not to be interrupted.“At one of our interviews, I think it was in New York, he asked me if I would bewilling to go into any electrical combination of which I was not the head. Isaid most emphatically that I would not go into any electrical combination ofwhich I was to be head … [nor] of which he was to be head. He told me how he ranhis stock down and deprived both Thomson and Houston of the benefits of anincreased stock issue….“I said to Coffin, ‘You tell me how you treated Thomson and Houston, why shouldI trust you after what you tell me?’“At another time … we were at a hotel in New York and Coffin proposed, I forgetthe exact details of the arrangement, that we should form a combination, so thatwhatever occurred, whether the companies were successful or unsuccessful, weshould make money under any circumstances. I said to Coffin … that I was not inthe habit of robbing my stockholders. There was no reply.”22[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts22a] As Barron heard, Westinghousehad nothing but contempt for his very successful rival.In the early months of 1891, George Westinghouse was spending week after week inNew York trying to save his company. Westinghouse, who hated newspaper puffery,even cooperated with The New York Times, which ran a flattering profile laudinghis “inventive genius … [and] the boldness and scope of his businessundertakings” and his abilities to “offhand, tell approximately the condition ofevery one of his companies, even down to the items which figure in the assetsand liabilities. He is a hard worker and not infrequently is at his office untillate at night.”23 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts23a] Nonetheless,January turned to February and the Westinghouse Electric news was only bad:“Boston men are gathering enough stock together to control the company.”24[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts24a] The ever upbeat Westinghousedismissed these rumors as sprung from some patent-sharing agreements withCoffin’s Thomson-Houston, a Massachusetts firm. But even George Westinghousecould not deny that the deadline for selling preferred stock had to be extendedto March 1, 1891. Then that date had to be pushed back again, this time to March20. Yet even as Westinghouse exerted his huge energies on rounding up reluctantinvestment capital, he found himself and his board suddenly ousted from one ofhis other companies, Union Switch and Signal. The industrial jackals, scentingweakness and distraction, were closing in to snatch whatever prizes they could.In the end, the jackals were beaten back and Westinghouse was reenthroned, butit was a rude reminder of vulnerability.Finally, on May 4, the annual stockholders meeting was convened in Pittsburgh atthe imposing Westinghouse Building. Fifty anxious investors assembled to hearwhat George Westinghouse would have to say. Westinghouse was present and lookedas hale and hearty as ever, not at all like a man who had spent the past fourmonths desperately seeking to save his company. Prior to the meeting, eachstockholder had received a circular that provided welcome confirmation of whathad otherwise been only broadly rumored: A syndicate consisting of AugustBelmont & Co. of New York, Lee, Higginson & Co. of Boston, and Brayton Ives,president of Western National Bank, was proposing to reorganize the WestinghouseElectric Company and its associated interests. However, as soon as Westinghouseopened the meeting, he politely made clear that negotiations were still underway, and thus the board proposed to adjourn the annual meeting to two weekshence.The Belmont plan was straightforward: The electric company would continue to becapitalized at $10 million. The stockholders of $7 million worth of shares werebeing asked to sacrifice 40 percent of their stock, to be sent to the MercantileTrust Company of New York. Another $3 million of stock issued but not sold wouldbe combined with this surrendered stock to create a $6 million pool of capital.Of this, $4 million would be converted into 7 percent stock, of which $3 millionwould be directed to paying off the debt and the rest given over for expansion.Another $500,000 would be held in reserve. The remainder would be used topurchase two companies already controlled by Westinghouse—U.S. Electric Lightingand Consolidated Electric Light Company. Westinghouse had acquired thesecompanies largely for their incandescent light bulb patents, crucial weapons inthe ongoing patent wars. They would become part of the bigger, properly financedWestinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company. Now it was up to theshareholders. Would they relinquish enough stock to save the company? Two weekshence, the postponed annual stockholders meeting was put off yet again, a mostunpromising sign.Even as George Westinghouse struggled to maintain control of his electriccompany, the entire electrical community was riveted, in that unsettling summerof 1891, on an altogether different—but equally momentous—matter. What had cometo be known as the Seven Years’ Incandescent Light Bulb War was heading into itsmost decisive phase. Ever since 1889, when Thomas Edison had triumphed inPittsburgh’s circuit court, the electrical companies and their bevies of lawyershad hoped to overturn Judge Bradley’s clear-eyed decision that Edison alone hadcreated a practical, functioning light bulb based on the novel and originallong-burning high-resistance filament set in an exhausted glass globe.Westinghouse and the U.S. Electric Lighting Company immediately appealed thedecision, determined to spin out the whole process for as long as possible. Forit was well understood that the minute the light bulb case was conclusively wonin favor of Edison General Electric, the company intended to cut off all accessto its light bulbs, save to its own beleaguered licensees. The electricalcommunity had long since been formally warned that the Edison people would seekthe right to extract in damages from infringing firms the terrifying sums of“$25 for each lamp in an original installation and $2.50 for each renewablelamp, independent of the fact that such decision would necessarily render yourplant inoperative.”25 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts25a]True, the Edison light bulb patent would run out in 1894, but that was littlesolace to the thousands of electrical men whose businesses faced extinctionwithout an Edison-style bulb. So when federal judge William Wallace of theSouthern District of New York sustained the earlier decision on Tuesday, July14, 1891, he unleashed low-level panic in the electrical ranks. Of course,Westinghouse would appeal, but Judge Wallace was reputed to be “appeal proof,”so it was not a future victory that was hoped for, only time. Nor were thetriumphant remarks of the Edison lawyers reassuring. The New York Times reportedthe next day, “They say that hitherto half of the incandescent lamps in thecountry have been manufactured by other companies.” The Edison legal teamenvisioned $2 million a year in new royalties pouring into the firm’s coffers.The black day of reckoning loomed.All this was sweet vindication for Thomas Edison, who gloried in hislong-awaited judicial triumph, the refutation of all those who dismissed hishistoric light bulb as mere tinkering with others’ breakthroughs. Above all,Edison hoped this excellent decision would squelch for good Villard’s tiresometalk about merging with the inventor’s patent-stealing rivals. The postdecisionstatements of Edison officer and attorney Major Sherbourne Eaton were music toEdison’s deaf ears: Now that the Edison Company’s rightful light bulb monopolyhad been reasserted, said Major Eaton, “the prospect of consolidation is farmore remote than ever, as the company would have nothing to gain and everythingto lose by such an operation.”26 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts26a]And who would not savor Judge Wallace’s much-commented-upon rebuke of Edison’slongtime nemesis Professor Morton Smith for daring to “belittle his [Edison’s]achievement” when testifying as an expert witness? In truth, Edison himself wasimmensely jaded on the subject of patents, having seen his company launchhundreds of lawsuits to little visible result thus far (aside from enrichingattorneys). The disgusted inventor could cite endless absurd claims anddecisions against him, like “the foreign patent lost because the patent officein that country discovered that something similar had been used in Egypt in 2000B.C.—not exactly the same device, but something nearly enough like it to defeatmy patent.”The moment Judge Wallace released his opinion, Electrical Engineer issued anextra that reprinted the decision in full. All ten thousand copies were quicklysnapped up. Editor T. Commerford Martin obviously hoped to calm the panickedelectricians and set a beneficent tone when he subsequently wrote in an Edisonlamp editorial: “As to the attitude of the Edison General [Electric] Co., we canonly hope and believe that the corporation will exercise its victory with themoderation which is always the best proof of the right to power.” Martin alsocorrectly pointed out that aside from as-yet-unknown judicial vicissitudes, thefuture would also be shaped by ever changing technology. Commerford, still verymuch Nikola Tesla’s great champion, proposed that the brilliant Serb’s “work isthe most striking illustration of the possibilities that lie before us. Mr.Tesla gave us a motor without a commutator; and it would be strangely in keepingif he gave us now a lamp without a filament.”27[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts27a]Even as the electricians were digesting the big Edison patent win, the boldGeorge Westinghouse once again proved all his naysayers wrong, pulling off whatmost deemed impossible: He had saved his cash-strapped electric company,emerging stronger than ever and still fully in charge. On July 15, 1891, inPittsburgh, at long last, the stockholders agreed to yield up hunks of theirholdings to pay off the company’s immediate debt. A new high-powered board wasinstalled, including such financiers as Bostonian Charles Francis Adams andAugust Belmont. The very issue of Electrical Engineer that opined about Edison’slamp triumph also congratulated Westinghouse on his own considerable coup,especially as it came in the immediate wake of his resounding light bulb loss toEdison. “The only inference possible,” noted the electrical journal, “is thatthe men of affairs … are well satisfied as to the outlook. We are ourselvesinclined to look upon the Westinghouse Company as now one of the most formidablein the field, and as being far more likely today to get business and do itprofitably than it was in the time of its inflation and extravagance.”Westinghouse’s lawyer, Paul D. Cravath, still marveled years later at thistriumph of reorganization. Westinghouse, he said, “found it difficult to workwith so-called financiers. What seemed to him to be their lack of vision andfaith was always annoying to him…. In at least two great financial crises, whenthe financiers had given up the task as hopeless, Mr. Westinghouse, by hisfaith, by his untiring energy, and by the exercise of a power to influence menthat I have never seen equaled, was able to weather the financial storm, raiseenormous sums of money, and restore his enterprises to a sound financialposition when his critics and most of his friends were certain that he wasfacing a crushing defeat.”28 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts28a]Once again, Westinghouse had emerged victorious.The light bulb win did not prove to be the great windfall Edison GeneralElectric had hoped. The final appeal dragged on, and the big Wall Streetinvestors once again became restive as they watched their Edison stock drop from$120 a share to $90. By mid-December of 1891, as famine, typhus, and smallpoxravaged parts of far-off Russia, The New York Times was reporting that HenryVillard’s days as president of Edison General Electric were numbered. “He is astrong talker and has wonderful personal magnetism,” noted the paper. “J.Pierpont Morgan, however, is a hard man to dazzle.”29[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts29a] So the rumors multiplied, werequashed, and then came to life again. The jovial Alfred O. Tate had been servingas Edison’s personal secretary since May of 1883, and he had heard the rumorsebb and flow so often, he paid them little mind. But on February 5, 1892, Tatewas sitting at his desk at the Edison Building at 16 Broad Street when one ofhis old friends, journalist Herbert Sinclair, whose beat was Wall Street, walkedin. Tate relates what happened in his memoir:“‘Alf,’ he said as he seated himself, ‘do you know that the Edison General[Electric] and Thomson-Houston are going to amalgamate?’“‘Herby,’ I replied, ‘that’s an old yarn that was buried long ago. Where did youresurrect it?’“‘Now listen to me,’ he answered, ‘I know what I am talking about. CharlieCoffin and Villard are in Morgan’s office right now and we are all waiting atHenry Clews’ office for the story. We have been told that we can break it afterthree o’clock.’”Tate jumped up and said he had to leave immediately to catch the ferry toOrange. “I’ll have to go right out to see Edison. He knows nothing about this.”It was a bone-chilling bright winter day as Tate raced through the well-dressedWall Street crowds, threaded through the jams of horsecars and trucks full ofhuge barrels, past the oyster sellers and hot-coffee carts, and down to theHoboken ferry. The wharves were full of ships, their masts jaunty with manyflags. The weather was so frigid that upriver in Poughkeepsie, ice yachts wereout racing across the great frozen riverine expanse. Tate would say in hismemoir, “I have always regretted the abruptness with which I broke the news toEdison but I am not sure that a milder manner and less precipitate deliverywould have cushioned the shock. I never before had seen him change color. Hiscomplexion naturally was pale, a clear healthy paleness, but following myannouncement it turned as white as his collar.“‘Send for [Samuel] Insull,’ was all he said as he left me standing in hislibrary. Insull [his treasurer] was sent for. What passed between them I do notknow. Edison never again made any reference to the subject except on onesignificant occasion.”30 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts30a]Back on the other side of the Hudson, J. P. Morgan in his smoke-filled officehad come to support the consolidation of Edison General Electric andThomson-Houston for the most obvious and compelling of business reasons: thebottom line. In 1891, Edison General Electric had sales of $11 million andprofits of $1.4 million, or an 11 percent return. Thomson-Houston had sales of$10 million and profits of $2.7 million, or a 26 percent return. Charles Coffinboasted to the investment bankers trying to push the merger that he was “beatingthe stuffing out of them [Edison] all along the line.”31[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts31a] Business was booming for bothcompanies, but once again Edison General Electric was sitting on a $4 millionpile of local electric stocks, unable to translate this paper into cash. Innotable contrast, the Boston bankers for the Thomson-Houston people hadprudently marketed and steadily sold these sorts of securities so they couldrecoup that capital. And, of course, there was the lure of the Edison light bulbpatent.Nonetheless, Coffin had begun to wonder why they should sell their company tothe Edison forces when Thomson-Houston was doing so well. In meetings at theBoston mansion of Morgan associate and Vanderbilt family member Hamilton McK.Twombly, one Thomson-Houston executive surprised the Morgan forces by saying,“We don’t think much of the way the Edison company has been managed.”32[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts32a] When their lack of enthusiasmwas conveyed to Morgan in Manhattan, he ordered, “Well, send them down here totalk to me.”33 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts33a] Coffin, with histhick brush mustache and hard-charging manner, went as bade to hold his meetingwith Morgan. The balance sheets of the competing companies deeply impressedMorgan with Coffin’s business savvy, for here was a man who produced twice theprofit of the Edison people. With that, Morgan could quite see that it made moresense for the better managers—the men of Thomson-Houston—to buy out EdisonGeneral Electric.Coffin then demurred, proposing a consolidation but one that left him in charge.Capitalized at $50 million, this financial reworking ranked in 1892 as thenation’s second-largest industrial merger. Edison stock was converted at a rateof one to one, Thomson-Houston stock at the rate of three shares for five newshares. While this sounded generous, the reality was that the smaller,lesser-known company was taking over the great name of the electric field.Edison shareholders now controlled only $15 million in the new company, comparedwith the $18 million controlled by the Thomson-Houston shareholders. Theremaining $17 million went into the treasury as future capital. The Edisonforces were routed in more than mere dollars. Most hurtful of all, the newcompany’s generic name—General Electric—tossed aside the names of the foundersof both firms. He, Edison, the father of electricity, his famous name, was beingdropped. And so it was that J. Pierpont Morgan, whose house had been the firstin New York to be wired for electricity by Edison but a decade earlier, nowerased Edison’s name out of corporate existence without even the courtesy of atelegram or a phone call to the great inventor. Edison biographer MatthewJosephson wrote, “To Morgan it made little difference so long as it all resultedin a big trustification for which he would be the banker.”34[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts34a] Edison had been, in thevocabulary of the times, Morganized.The New-York Daily Tribune reported two weeks later that “Edison was sodisgusted with the turn affairs had taken he proposed to withdraw entirely…. Hefeels much aggrieved over what he considers the mismanagement of the company andthe sacrifice of his interests.”35[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts35a] This was, of course, completelytrue, but Edison hated to look like a sap, so the very day that story appearedhe quickly adopted his usual cocky public face. He did not want the world or hisenemies to know his company had been sold out from under him without so much asa word from the money men. For the many reporters, Edison now assumed his bestcavalier manner, explaining that he was already on to bigger, better things. “Icannot waste my time over electric-lighting matters, for they are old. I ceasedto worry over those things ten years ago, and I have a lot more new material onwhich to work. Electric lights are too old for me. I simply wish to get as largedividends as possible from such stock as I hold. I am not businessman enough tospend my time at that end of the concern. I think I was the first to urge theconsolidation.”36 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts36a] He insistedthat the new company, which would dominate three-quarters of the electricmarket, was no trust or monopoly.The influential editor of the Electrical Engineer, T. Commerford Martin, whoonce briefly worked for Edison at Menlo Park, wrote an editorial in the wake ofthe announcement titled “Mr. Edison’s Mistake.” He pondered what had broughtabout Edison General Electric’s demise. Without question one could blame “thediscontinuous, frequently changing, though often able, organization andmanagement of the Edison interests,” he said. But was not the far greater cause,he proposed, “the attitude taken, and persistently held, by Mr. Edison towardsalternating current distribution? He could see no merit in that system. But uponits advent, its possibilities were promptly perceived by others…. Since itsintroduction for long-distance service, six years ago, it has practically driventhe direct system from the field of much central station business. Mr. Edisonset his face against it as a flint from the first, and has sought on everypossible occasion to discredit it through the weight in the community of hisjustly great name. But the tide would not turn back at his frown.” Here in thisfirst and most furious of battles pitting one new modern technology againstanother, the superior technology had thus far prevailed. But despite Edison’sobstinate opposition to AC, which T. C. Martin believed had cost Edison hiscompany, Martin also believed Edison’s greatness would endure. “His name andfame are too deeply impressed upon the world to incur any risk of obscurationthrough any changes of business or methods.”37[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts37a]Understandably, Edison took little pleasure in the fall of 1892 over his finalvictory and vindication in the Seven Years’ Incandescent Light Bulb War, whenyet another court sustained his lamp patent. This was slender solace to thewounded wizard in his New Jersey redoubt. Edison’s secretary, Alfred O. Tate,went out to see Edison several months after the patent decision was handed down,wanting some technical information about a battery project. He found Edisonstanding alone at his big rolltop desk in the magnificent two-story book-linedlibrary. Atop the desk was sculptor Aurelio Bordigo’s spritelike statue holdingaloft a lamp. Edison himself had purchased Genius of Electricity during thosehappy months in late 1889 at the Paris Exposition. When the young Tate put hiselectrical question to the great electrician, Edison answered vehemently, “Tate,if you want to know anything about electricity go out to the galvanometer roomand ask Kennelly. He knows far more about it than I do. In fact, I’ve come tothe conclusion that I never did know anything about it. I’m going to dosomething now so different and so much bigger than anything I’ve ever donebefore that people will forget that my name ever was connected with anythingelectrical.”Tate was utterly stunned at Edison’s bitterness and vehemence. “I knew thatsomething had died in Edison’s heart and that it had not been replaced by thedifferent and bigger thing to which he had referred. His pride had been wounded.There was no trace of vanity in his character, but he had a deep-seated,enduring pride in his name. And that name had been violated, torn from the titleof the great industry created by his genius through years of intensive planningand unremitting toil.”38 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c09-nts38a]Was a similar fate in the offing for George Westinghouse? He had successfully,against all odds and expectations, secured the necessary loans and a new pool ofcapital for the electric company. Nonetheless, the Electrical Engineer ofFebruary 17, 1892, had reported, “It seems quite reasonable to expect, as manydo, and as rumor has it, that absorption of the Westinghouse Company into theproposed new [General Electric] corporation will soon follow. The provision of$16,600,000 of stock—$6 million of which is in preferred shares—remaining to thetreasury after taking up the Edison and Thomson-Houston stocks, is thought bymany to imply the use of a considerable portion of it in taking over theWestinghouse Company when convenient; but no information of such a plan has beenmade public.” When convenient. Even a man as tough as Westinghouse had to readthose words with at least a tinge of trepidation. While he had yet to get hisTesla AC system working, no one doubted that he would. Clearly, the people atGeneral Electric, who would now control three-quarters of the nation’selectrical business, would want those AC patents. And J. P. Morgan, who was nowa firm GE backer, was a man who preferred a tidy monopoly above all otherindustrial arrangements."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_025_r1.jpg]A night view of the Court of Honor, World’s Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893CHAPTER 10The World’s Fair: “The Electrician’s Ideal City”In mid-May of 1892, George Westinghouse was hurtling along in his privaterailcar, the Glen Eyre, crossing the spring Indiana prairie bright withwildflowers. Ahead lay the sprawling metropolis of Chicago, the booming citythat Pullman porters admiringly tagged the “Boss Town of America.” ThePennsylvania Railroad’s powerful locomotive began to clang its bells urgently,for it was speeding into “an industrial amphitheater bigger and blacker thanPittsburgh—endless reaches of factories, marshaling yards, slaughterhouses,grain elevators, and iron mills, and slag heaps and coal piles that looked likesmall mountains. Soot-covered cable cars and long lines of freight wagons waitedat crossings for the train to shoot by, and everywhere, covering everything,were wind-driven clouds of black and gray smoke.”1[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts1a] As the train slowed, Chicago’salready fabled two dozen skyscrapers came briefly into view, modernarchitectural temples to the city’s determined energy and imagination. Thisfast-moving commercial New World crossroads and hub of three dozen railroads hadalready created more than two hundred millionaires. Now the most ambitious ofthem were organizing the next great World’s Fair. And George Westinghouse wantedits biggest electrical contract.George Westinghouse had in the spring of 1892 become the darling of the Chicagonewspapers, hailed as the electrical white knight sallying boldly forth at thelast moment from distant Pittsburgh to joust with the contemptible knaves of theThomson-Houston and Edison “electrical trust.” These arrogant princes of easterncommerce had submitted one extortionate bid after another to light Chicago’supcoming World’s Fair. Charles Coffin of the new General Electric Company hadthoroughly misjudged the hard-eyed Chicago dreamers, the city’s business elitehell-bent on putting their raw but mesmerizing metropolis on the internationalmap, a metropolis hailed by English journalist George Warrington Steevens as“Chicago, queen and guttersnipe of cities, cynosure and cesspool of the world!Not if I had a hundred tongues, everyone shouting a different language in adifferent key, could I do justice to her splendid chaos.”2[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts2a] Now its great men were buildingat lightning speed the most spectacular of all World’s Fairs—the ColumbianExposition, set to open May 1 of 1893 (a year late in deference to thepresidential election) as a celebration of the four hundredth anniversary of thediscovery of America. The fair would showcase the industrial and cultural mightof marvelous Chicago, the United States, and foreign nations as disparate asGermany, Brazil, Egypt, and Samoa.The Chicago fair directors were not amused to be mistaken for rubes and crooksby the hard-charging Coffin, who, seeing that Westinghouse was not in thebidding, demanded sky-high rates. In mid-March, General Electric had submittedto the fair a bid of $38.50 per arc light for six thousand lights. In vividcontrast, just the previous October, World’s Fair officials had paid a thirdthat rate, $11 per arc light, to Chicago Edison (before Morgan’s“trustification”) to light the fair construction site for night work. The faircommittee, not liking to be gouged, promptly sidestepped Coffin and worked outcheaper arrangements—$20 an arc light—with several smaller firms that were notpart of the new “electrical combine.” The local papers gloated: CANNOT ROB THEFAIR, and CUT A HIGH BID IN TWO; ELECTRIC LIGHT COMBINE HUMBLED, and EUCRED THETRUST; EXPOSITION DIRECTORS AHEAD. But Coffin did not blink, and he nextsubmitted an equally outrageous bid for dynamos—$15.78 per horsepower. Again theirritated fair directors simply improvised and went around him, contracting witha smaller local concern for $2.50 a horsepower.By early April, the committee was ready to award the most important of thefair’s electrical contracts—the ninety-two thousand outdoor incandescent lampsthat would set aglow the fairgrounds for six months. All the big lightingcompanies, save for Westinghouse, were now wrapped up with the trust. So onApril 2, when the fair directors opened the big iron bid box, there lay only twobids—General Electric’s bid of $18.50 per lamp, or $1,720,000, and that of thelittle South Side Machine and Metal Works, for $6.80 a lamp, or $625,600.Southside’s proprietor was an unknown Chicago businessman named Charles F.Locksteadt. “The big concerns stood aghast,” recalled Westinghouse biographerFrancis Leupp. “Who was this intruder? Could anyone of consequence vouch for hisresponsibility? Who would manufacture the apparatus for him?” The answer was notlong in coming. “Mr. Locksteadt approached Mr. Westinghouse, hoping to interesthim in the situation, and in due course the Westinghouse Electric andManufacturing Company advised the officials that it would undertake to carry outthe Locksteadt bid.”3 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts3a] Theofficials, seeing a possible savings of almost $1 million, naturally welcomedWestinghouse into the fray.And so was launched, in this roundabout way, the next great battle in the War ofthe Electric Currents. From the very beginning, George Westinghouse hadenvisioned an entire nation, and ultimately a whole globe, powered by thepotential of cheap alternating current. Thomas Edison’s malign campaign tobanish AC had thus far come to naught, save to cause Edison’s own undoing andthe loss of his beloved electric company to the fast-talking but talented formershoe salesman Charles Coffin. During the past year and a half, GeorgeWestinghouse had been too preoccupied with simply preserving his own electriccompany to contemplate bidding upon the fair. But now the fiscal storms hadcleared, his coffers were flush with Boston and New York capital, and a mostinteresting electrical proposition was at his door: Join forces with the feistyLocksteadt and provide ninety-two thousand incandescent lights for what promisedto be the grandest showcase in American history. The stakes were not immediatelyabout money, but about the unparalleled opportunity to display to anunsuspecting world for six months the true glories and possibilities ofelectricity, specifically alternating current. The competition was no longerwith Thomas Edison, but with Charles Coffin and General Electric.At the grimy Garrison Alley Works in Pittsburgh, said draftsman E. S.McClelland, “Mr. Westinghouse startled us by informing us that he was going toChicago, Illinois, to get the contract for the lighting of the ColumbianExposition to be held in that city in 1893. No one took him seriously in thisventure. None of us dreamed that he would be successful in this mission.”4[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts4a] But Westinghouse was utterlyserious. Later, the boss returned to the Westinghouse Building downtown andsummoned his public relations man, Ernest H. Heinrichs, to his spacious office.Westinghouse was sitting as usual at his immense table desk. Six magnificentupholstered chairs were arrayed around its sides, while a valuable Persiancarpet covered the floor. Off in one corner stood a big bookcase containingcopies of the Patent Office Gazette and various engineering journals. A plainwooden clock ticked the time above the fireplace. Westinghouse looked up atHeinrichs, the former industrial reporter for Pittsburgh’s Chronicle Telegraph,and asked, “Do you know any newspapermen in Chicago well?” Heinrichs said he didnot, but Westinghouse told him to go to Chicago anyway, connect up with thelocal reporters, and press their side of the story.Heinrichs cogitated and then called the Pittsburgh Associated Press man, an oldfriend named Colonel W. C. Connelly. The colonel just happened to be travelingto Chicago himself, and the two took the train together to the sprawling nervecenter of the Midwest. “For the next three days the Colonel remained with me,”wrote Heinrichs, “taking me from one newspaper office to another and securingfor me an introduction and a hearing…. In the meantime, Mr. Westinghouse himselfarrived at the Auditorium Hotel, [and] no time was lost in taking thenewspapermen to see him. His magnetic personality, his affability, his genialmanner and straightforwardness, completely won the entire press.”5[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts5a] And so, the Chicago reporters,already well steeped in their dislike of the unregenerate “electrical trust,”embraced George Westinghouse and hailed him as the city’s most excellent knightand champion.The moment Westinghouse charged gaudily onto the World’s Fair field to offer alower bid, GE too returned to the lists, shamelessly slashing its original bidof $18.50 a light down to $6. Coffin always sent his surrogates, men whoseentitled, moping manner only further annoyed the hostile Chicago press. Thisparticular electrical tournament entailed numerous jousts spread over manyspring weeks, accompanied by much hue and cry and plaints of foul play. Fairpresident Harlow Higinbotham, an upstanding partner in the palatial MarshallField’s department store, was proud of both his probity and his mercantileability to drive a good bargain. He elected to allow an entirely new and finalround of bids for early May. The Chicago Times rejoiced at this news, declaring,WILL UNDERBID THE TRUST: MR. WESTINGHOUSE PROMISES TO MAKE ELECTRICAL FUR FLY.6[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts6a] So it was that in mid-May, duringa brief spell of lovely weather, Westinghouse was arriving once again in thegreat smoky hurly-burly of Chicago. Tall, commanding, wearing his usual formaldark vested suit and carrying the ever-present umbrella, his muttonchop whiskersand walrus mustache bristling, Westinghouse stepped off the plush quiet of theGlen Eyre into the cacophony of the Pennsylvania Railroad’s cavernous Chicagodepot with its vaulting steel-and-glass roof. There the arc lights blazed andhissed, gleaming locomotives belched great billows of steam, porters trundledsteamer trunks and suitcases, and newsboys in knickers hawked one or the otherof the city’s twenty-seven newspapers. Westinghouse and his longtime friend andcounsel Charles Terry threaded their way toward the street. They had beensummoned by telegram to discuss their new bid to furnish and light allninety-two thousand incandescent lights needed for the exposition’s outdoorillumination. The Thomson-Houston and Edison men of General Electric would alsobe present to argue their case, even as the Chicago press jeered at theprecipitous drop in their original greedy bid.While the World’s Fair directors had been thrashing through the complexities oflaunching this world-class exposition, including the important and costlyelectricity contracts, seven thousand men had been laboring away for more than ayear out at the desolate fairgrounds of Jackson Park, a bleak, swampy bog sevenmiles south of the city on Lake Michigan. Through bone-chilling gales andsnowstorms, stifling heat and dust, the men and great armies of mules hadwrested from this forbidding six-hundred-acre swamp a fairy-tale transformation:an utterly unlikely, elegant Venetian-style landscape of canals and lagoonswhimsically envisioned (for a $15 million fee) by the venerable landscapearchitect Frederick Law Olmsted. All around the long rectangular Great Basin,the most central of the placid and lovely waterways, was being built theneoclassical White City, a fantastical Court of Honor of colossal and chimericalpalaces, each to serve as a splendiferous exhibition hall of modern wonders.Passengers and crew on passing Lake Michigan steamships could only exclaim atthese dreamy, surreal palaces they saw rising from the dust, appearing half-hewnfrom the most ancient creamy Parian marble, all linked by their mythic nobilityand the simple device of common roof pediment lines.Yet these classical structures with their Ionic columns, slender arches, granddomes, towers, turrets, and spires were but skillful dreams and illusions, the“marble” exteriors being nothing but “staff.” This dextrous combination ofplaster of Paris and hemp was clad sturdily but ever so beautifully ontogigantic iron-and-steel structures, the exteriors ornamented with the mostelaborate of architectural details. Chicagoans were so fascinated by thespectacle that thousands slogged out daily, undeterred by winter’s frigid mud orsummer’s sweltering dust, to gawk at the swarms of fast-moving constructioncrews building faux ancient palaces. The shrewd fair directors quickly turned itinto a tidy tourist business, charging entry.If there was one man in Chicago who could claim credit for this strange,ethereal classical dream arising from the mire of Jackson Park, it was Daniel H.Burnham, one of the city’s preeminent architects and designers. Burnham,forty-four, was a handsome, vital man who, with his partner, John Wellborn Root,had designed and built several of the city’s most admired skyscrapers. Burnhamwas the fair’s director of works, the dynamo with the jutting jaw and steelywill who pushed mercilessly to complete what many said could not be done. InFebruary of 1891, Burnham had installed himself out in the great wastes ofJackson Park, his command post a rustic log cottage with a massive stonefireplace and an excellent store of wine and aged Madeira, consolation againstthe howling winds whipping off the lake and the sheer brute grind. There the manknown to his construction troops as the “Commander in Chief” spent part of eachweek.Most of the engineers and the great army of workers lived in huge barracks. Thewhole construction site was fenced off with barbed wire to keep out labororganizers, the gates manned with guards. The weather was relentless, but ice orblistering heat, Burnham pushed the men and himself to the brink, seven days aweek. Said one observer, “The life of the Director of Works and his staff waslike that of soldiers on the field. They seldom went home, their entire energieswere put into the work, and there was no cessation day or night.”7[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts7a] Starting the previous October,another shift of men had begun working the cold wintry nights, somethingpossible because the Edison electric plant now powered bright arc lights. TheEdison electricity also ran fifty motors that were speeding work along byoperating dredges, crushers, tool sharpeners, sawmills, pumps, the hoists forthe heavy beams and trusses, and eventually the electric spray painters thatmade the “staff” so like pearly white marble.On Monday, May 16, George Westinghouse and Charles Terry arrived at the World’sFair’s offices in the Rookery, a Burnham building on LaSalle Street, wherealmost two dozen men had assembled. Some were already nervously smoking cigars.Chief Burnham and the other members of the Committee on Grounds and Buildingswere installed at a long table, where sat the sealed iron bid box. Sitting inother chairs were Captain Eugene Griffin, a second vice president for GeneralElectric, and the firm’s two local managers. Once Westinghouse and Terry werealso seated, all waited expectantly as the bid box was unlocked and unsealed.Cigar smoke drifted about amid the low whispering. The final electrical joustwas about to begin. Once again there were only two bids. General Electric’s wasread aloud first. Their new DC-only bid was $577,485, their new AC-only bid$480,694. As every man sitting in that Rookery office was well aware, these newGeneral Electric bids were a shameless one-third the company’s original$1,720,000 bid. There were various murmurings and men glancing at one another.Then, as the new Westinghouse bids were taken up to be read, silence descended,only the street noises filtering through. Westinghouse’s bid for a combinationof DC and AC was $499,559. The GE men squirmed and looked unhappy. Westinghousewas undercutting the trust. Westinghouse’s AC offer for all ninety-two thousandlights was $399,000, $80,000 below the trust’s best bid. Daniel H. Burnham, fairconstruction director and a forceful man of definite opinions, said promptlythat the contract should go to Westinghouse. But the other committee membersbalked. One later memoir claimed that some were “stockholders in the GeneralElectric Company” still determined to see Coffin prevail.8[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts8a] The committee retreated to alocked office. Hour after hour passed. The lights in the nearby buildings hadgone dark. At 7:00 P.M., when the janitors began cleaning the halls and offices,the exhausted committee men agreed to reconvene the next morning. As they allleft, Westinghouse said to a Daily Interocean reporter, “There is not much moneyin the work at the figures I have made, but the advertisement will be a valuableone and I want it.”9 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts9a]And so, Tuesday morning, as the lovely spring weather held, the joust resumed atthe Rookery. Captain Griffin of GE sulkily insisted that George Westinghousecould not possibly carry out the contract, because, reported the ChicagoTribune, “his patents … were involved in litigation. [GE] had injunctionproceedings instituted against the use of the lamp which Mr. Westinghouseproposed to furnish.” Westinghouse laughed affably, responding, “There wasn’tthe slightest question about his ability to furnish the lamps desired.” Anotherfair director complained in exasperation to the Daily Interocean, “For manyyears the Edison Company contented itself with flooding the country withcirculars trying to ridicule the Westinghouse system. One morning it suddenlyawoke to find it had a competitor. Now it says that if the contract is given toWestinghouse an injunction will head him off…. One moment’s thought will showhow great a bluff is made.”10 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts10a]However breezy Westinghouse might be, the issue of the Edison light bulb patentwas deadly serious. The bitter legal war was in its final appeals, and everywell-informed electrician, including Westinghouse, fully expected GE to win.What no one could know yet was whether GE would be judicially obliged to sellEdison bulbs to anyone but their own customers. Burnham agreed they should putoff awarding the contract for a few days while they consulted the fair lawyers.In this Chicago battle of the War of the Electric Currents, Westinghouse wasmotivated not just by his longtime electrical dreams, but by his great dislikeof GE’s chief, Charles Coffin, an animosity that was completely mutual. Onecould easily imagine that Westinghouse would take great pleasure in denyingCharles Coffin and GE the World’s Fair contract, even at the lowball bids theywere both now making. After all, if Coffin had been less grasping and gouging,the whole huge contract would have been his back in early April.On May 22, the committee once again summoned Westinghouse by telegram, and onceagain he climbed aboard the Glen Eyre for the twelve-hour journey across Ohioand Indiana. Many friends urged him not to undertake this vast and perilous job,one where failure was a high and public probability. But sanguine as ever andwreathed in his electrical dreams, Westinghouse arrived at the Rookery the nextafternoon. The lawyers had ruled in his favor, but now the committee wasproposing to split the contract in two. George Westinghouse “said he was thelowest bidder,” reported the Chicago Tribune, “has first-class apparatus andshould get the entire job.” He was not a man of half measures. When thetruculent Captain Griffin again raised the light bulb patent issue, thecommittee asked if Westinghouse would ease their minds by providing a $1 millionbond guaranteeing the contract. Certainly, Westinghouse said genially.Once more, the committee withdrew to wrangle. Hour after hour ticked by.Outside, the sky grew dark, and the noise of LaSalle Street down below subsided.Many cigars were smoked, and the room grew stale and stuffy. The electric lightscame on in the Rookery. Finally, the committee agreed at 7:30 P.M. to vote.Quickly and unanimously, they bestowed their shimmering prize on GeorgeWestinghouse and his Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company. A soreloser, Captain Griffin responded angrily, immediately threatening that when thelight bulb patent ruling went their way, Westinghouse would “be entirely in ourpower. He will not be able to make his own lamps and he can only buy from us. Wewill not injure the fair, but we will not let him continue his contract.”11[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts11a]As for Westinghouse, he did not gloat but picked up his black umbrella andprepared to leave, telling the newsmen only, “I shall put in ten or twelvedynamos of 12,000 lamp capacity and furnish a clean-cut, first-class system. Ihave about 100,000 lamps, either completed or partly so, at the works, and therewill be no difficulty in furnishing material. I am required to have between5,000 and 10,000 lamps installed by the 1st of October. This is an easy task.There will be no difficulty in furnishing the entire plant by the time of theopening of the Exposition.”12 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts12a] Aneasy task, Westinghouse said with his signature insouciance. Electrical Engineerwondered if Westinghouse would really go through with this latest recklessendeavor. After all, he first needed to ante up another $500,000 for his $1million bond. “Mr. Westinghouse may not care to put up so large a bond, and theamount does seem rather heavy, but he is not the kind of man to stop short afterhaving gone so far.”13 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts13a] Amen.The morning after George Westinghouse’s return from Chicago, the “Old Man,” ashis workers called him, went straight to the company’s machine shop and summonedE. S. McClelland, a top draftsman, to the front office. His employee of a dozenyears appeared armed with a pad and pencil. McClelland, who had been amazed whenhis boss sailed off in the Glen Eyre for Chicago to seek this great electricalprize, now learned for the first time that his boss had—to everyone’sastonishment—won the great contract. He also was learning what would be wantedfor this gigantic Chicago World’s Fair contract:“Mr. Westinghouse: ‘I want an engine.’“Reply: ‘Yes, sir.’“‘1,200 brake horse power.’“‘Yes, sir,’ with considerable trepidation.“‘200 revolutions per minute.’ (Engines of that size usually run about 75 R. P.M.)“‘Yes, sir,’ with considerable consternation.“‘150 pounds per square inch boiler pressure, non condensing.’“‘Yes, sir.’“‘Splash lubrication.’“‘Yes, sir.’“‘Must go in such and such space.’“‘Yes, sir.’“‘I will be in again at 2:00 o’clock to see what you have.’“Exit Mr. Westinghouse,” said Mr. McClelland, “leaving me in a daze. It is hardto describe the feeling of consternation that request caused. We were building250 horse power engines [then]…. A 1200 brake horse power engine to operate at200 revolutions per minute seemed to me to be entirely out of all reason. Yetthis was the task set before us. Mr. Westinghouse needed such an engine.” Infact, he needed many. The response of McClelland’s boss in the draftingdepartment was that Westinghouse was “asking for the impossible and he justwon’t get it.” Yet all the draftsmen knew somehow they must produce some kind ofan engine design by the afternoon, so they set to work. At 2:00 P.M.,Westinghouse called to say he would not be by till the next morning. McClellandand another man stayed on in the drafting room till 2:00 A.M., striving todevise something they could show Westinghouse. The next day at dawn, very early,they all reassembled to look at this drawing, turning the drawing board on itsside for a better view. “This setting of the board on end, strange as it mayseem, gave us the solution to the problem…. As a vertical engine there was spaceto spare. When this solution flashed upon our minds the leading engine draftsmanseemed to be electrified and became wildly enthusiastic.” Soon GeorgeWestinghouse strode in “with his usual good-natured alertness and expectancy,”viewed the work with approval, and said, “How soon may I have four of them?” Sothe work began on “new and untried electrical machines and steam engines of atotally new design.”14 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts14a]During the bidding in Chicago, George Westinghouse had laughed in CaptainGriffin’s face at the Rookery when the GE vice president predicted Westinghousewould have no light bulbs at all, much less ninety-two thousand to light up thefairy-tale White City. But that was a very, very real possibility. In truth,“matters were critical, not to say dangerous,” says his friend and biographerHenry Prout. “The Westinghouse Company was committed to the contract forlighting the Chicago’s World’s Fair. It had already equipped many plants whichmust have lamps for renewals. Unless a non-patent-infringing lamp could befurnished, the company could sell no more incandescent-lighting material. Theneed for such a lamp was immediate and urgent.”15[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts15a]Westinghouse knew as well as the GE men that he desperately needed anoninfringing light bulb. What they did not know was that he was actually makingsteady progress on that dire problem. Back in the smoky precincts of hisPittsburgh factories, Westinghouse had been revisiting his patents for an oldSawyer-Man “stopper” light, personally working and tinkering on it for somemonths, striving to reach the point where he could mass-produce it in thegigantic quantities needed. Unlike Edison’s one-piece bulb, Westinghouse’s hadtwo pieces with a low-resistance filament sitting in an iron-and-glass “stopper”that was fitted like a cork into a glass globe filled with nitrogen and thensealed. The stopper could be removed and burned-out filaments replaced. With theWorld’s Fair looming and GE’s hostility palpable, Westinghouse now set up aglass factory in a section of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company in Alleghenyand went there daily to teach the operatives running the grinding machines howto make the stoppers perfectly snug for the lamps. His World’s Fair manager, E.E. Keller, marveled at Westinghouse’s “own enthusiasm at having overcome a greatobstacle. He was bubbling over like a boy. He explained the operation of thegrinders and I saw that the men … seemed imbued with the idea that this was agame to beat an opponent who held all the aces, and that they were having a lotof fun doing it. He had a sort of magnetic influence on the workmen…. Itcertainly was a great delight to realize that, in spite of what seemed ahopeless situation, ‘the boss’ was going to furnish lamps without payingtribute. He certainly lifted the worry from me.”16[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts16a]By the time Edison’s light bulb patent was upheld in the federal court ofappeals on October 4, 1892, Westinghouse coolly professed to The New York Timesthat while he, the plaintiff in the case, obviously thought the court decisionwrong, it was of no import to him. “Having anticipated it, we shall not behampered by it,” he said. “Our business has been arranged with a view to thishappening. The patent sustained has almost expired anyway, and furthermore, suchdevelopments have been made in the electrical world in the last year or two thatthe decision is shorn of much of its effect.”17[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts17a]The very next issue of Electrical Engineer carried the first Westinghouse ad forits “stopper” lamp, and the magazine, in an editorial comment, noted thatbecause the new-style lamp could be almost entirely machine-made, it would becheaper than an Edison lamp. This was a good thing, because the “stopper” lampdid not last as long as an Edison bulb. As a stopgap it would do until theEdison patent expired. Meanwhile, the regular Westinghouse light bulb factorycontinued to churn out Edison-style bulbs, for the Edison case was now on appealto the U.S. Supreme Court.GE was no longer content to quietly await their final victory, and inmid-November they struck again, asking a federal court to stop Westinghouse frommaking Edison-style bulbs. George Westinghouse, knowing the growing public furyover the power of the new trusts, a corporate form that had been mushrooming,struck back hard. In court papers, he accused GE of being “a most vicious trust”that was doing their damnedest to drive honest competitors like him out ofbusiness. He urged that GE be investigated under the two-year-old ShermanAnti-Trust Act.18 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts18a] Westinghousedemanded that the court force GE to sell their competitors light bulbs. Thejudge declined to do anything for either side. Just over a month later, onDecember 15, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the long litigated Edison light bulbpatent. The Seven Years’ Incandescent Light Bulb War was over. GE’s wrath wouldindeed be forcibly tempered by certain judicially imposed moderations, and muchof the electrical fraternity breathed a collective sigh of relief. However, allthose who actually manufactured the infringing bulbs were forced out ofbusiness.But this was not the end of the corporate warfare. George Westinghouse and hiswife and son were in Manhattan for the 1892 Christmas season. On the afternoonof December 23, Westinghouse had completed some business with his friend andlegal counsel Charles Terry, and the two had just boarded the uptown elevatedwhen they encountered longtime chief counsel for the Edison Electric LightCompany, Grosvenor P. Lowrey. Despite their epic legal battles, the men were allfriends, so the two Pittsburgh men sat down with Edison’s lawyer in the swayingcars. As they were chatting, Lowrey jovially mentioned that one of his manyco-counsels, Frederick Fish, was away in Pittsburgh. Westinghouse’s ears prickedup and he casually tried to find out why. Lowrey realized he’d said too much. Atthe next stop, 14th Street, Westinghouse indicated to Terry that they should getoff. As soon as the doors shut and the train began steaming away from theplatform, Westinghouse asked Terry, “What is Fish doing in Pittsburgh?”As they walked down the station steps into the bundled-up crowds and passinghorsecars, Westinghouse said, “I can’t conceive what would call him there exceptto make new trouble for us. We shall have to act quickly to head it off,whatever it is.”They alerted by telegram a Westinghouse lawyer in Pittsburgh to be at thefederal court the next day, the morning of Christmas Eve. And there indeed thefollowing morning stood GE’s Mr. Frederick Fish in his sober black suit. He eyedthe well-known countenance of the Westinghouse lawyer, who was holding a packetof papers. Now that the final decision had come from the U.S. Supreme Court, GEwas stealthily striking again. But this time the firm hoped to get a restrainingorder, not for the old bulbs, but for Westinghouse’s new Sawyer-Man “stopper”bulb, claiming that it, too, infringed on their now rock-solid patent. GE knewthat if they could shut down Westinghouse’s Allegheny “stopper” lamp factory,even for a few weeks, they might well sabotage his whole World’s Fair contract.But with the Westinghouse lawyer on hand, Judge Acheson was not inclined to makeany drastic rulings. After the New Year, the judge quickly concluded that the“stopper” lamp was “no infringement of the Edison lamp patents.” WroteWestinghouse biographer Francis Leupp, “Although more or less harassing warfarewas kept up afterward, this unexpected proceeding in court so far cleared theway for Westinghouse that he was able to proceed with the manufacture of hislamps and carry out his great undertaking at Chicago.”19[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts19a]The Westinghouse engineers were now building from scratch the biggest AC centralstation yet installed in America, a plant capable of powering 160,000 lights aswell as many motors. Up until now, a big-city AC plant powered at most 10,000lights and, of course, no motors. But at long last, the electric company wasmaking real headway and expected to exhibit a whole Tesla AC system at the fair,including an AC motor. The fashionably dressed Nikola Tesla came forth from hisManhattan laboratory, where the eccentric inventor was steadily advancing intothe uncharted terrain of high-frequency electricity, to consult with theWestinghouse engineers at the noisy Allegheny works. Westinghouse wanted topromote two-phase AC, with an eye to showing the glories of hissoon-to-be-available Tesla induction motors. Longtime Westinghouse engineerBenjamin Lamme, who did much of the engine work, recalls, “It was at Mr.Westinghouse’s suggestion that the machines for the lighting plant at Chicagowere each made with two single phase alternators, side by side, with theirarmature windings staggered 90 degrees.”20[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts20a] Two of these were combined tocreate Tesla’s two-phase current. Each double unit could light thirty thousand“stopper” lamps. Westinghouse was building in plenty of insurance. If agenerator shorted, no fairgoer would ever notice, for another would kick inimmediately. They would be powered by one great 2,000-horsepower Allis-Chalmersengine, as well as numerous 1,000-horsepower engines, all fueled with oil(supplied by Standard Oil) rather than coal. The White City would have no smokypall.In late January of 1893, the Electrical Engineer could report that manyelectrical visitors had traveled to Pittsburgh to see the twelve almostcompleted towering generators of seventy-five tons each. The rotating armaturesalone weighed twenty-one tons. “With the 12 1,000 h.p. engines required to drivethem they will constitute the largest single exhibit of operating machinery evermade at any exposition, and probably the most extensive exhibit in the Fair.”21[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts21a] Despite Westinghouse’s airy talkof “easy tasks,” these huge Westinghouse machines arrived in Chicago only weeksbefore opening day. They were being installed in the south nave of the vastinterior steel-and-iron spaces of Machinery Hall, one of the Court of Honorpalaces, at the end of April. Opening day was Monday, May 1.The afternoon before, on Sunday, the very earnest Englishman Reverend F. HerbertStead ventured forth to the not-yet-opened fair to report what he saw for thehighly respected Review of Reviews. He took the tramway out as windblowntorrents beat down. At Jackson Park, his umbrella open against the chilly,gusting downpour and his high-button shoes sinking in squishy cold mud, theReverend Stead said, “I found the World’s Fair en deshabille. . . . The roadswithin the gates were even more miry than those without…. The disjecta membra ofa whole host of statues lay about … helmeted heads, bare arms, and greaved legsof heroes in profusion … swarms of workmen gave the same impression of grossincompleteness.”But that first impression was soon swept away. Just as Chicago’s cacophonousenergy and dirty ugliness stunned visitors, so did the White City, but as theantithesis of all things Chicago. From a balcony high on the majestic gold-domedAdministration Building, Reverend Stead forgot his cold, soaked clothes andgazed wonder-struck down through the sheets of rain and drifting fog. There hebeheld the classical Court of Honor around the Great Basin, its placid waterspatterned by pelting rain, and beyond that, the lovely meandering waterways andall that Burnham and his troops had wrought. Reverend Stead was driven, as somany would be, to wax horribly poetic: “It was a poem entablatured in fairypalaces…. It was a dream of beauty which blended the memory of classic greatnesswith the sense of Alpine snows…. It was a vision of the ideal, enhaloed withmystery.”22 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts22a] The rain eased, andtrailing clouds wisped in and around these astonishing alabaster palaces andglistening waters, rendering them even more mutely ethereal.Mirabile dictu, on opening day the leaden blanket of rain lifted and bymidmorning sun blazed down through the vanishing clouds. Reverend Stead arrivedwith the multitudes squeezing off the packed trams, trains, and Lake Michiganferries. The good Englishman made his way to the Court of Honor and installedhimself with the restless crowd of sweating journalists on benches below thespeaker’s platform. Soon all was an undulating sea of dark derbies andbroad-brimmed millinery, brightened only by the occasional light blue dab of theuniformed fair police. The sun sweltered. Up on the balcony of the gold-domedAdministration Building seventy-five American Indians in full war paint andheaddresses watched this celebration of the conquest of their lands. Yells andcheers rippled through the crowd as at last President Grover Cleveland, fullythree hundred pounds, ascended to the elevated stage, followed by a retinue ofdignitaries. Stead approved President Cleveland’s “simple morning dress of theordinary civilian, without ribbon or medal” and his speech, for “he alone of allthe speakers made himself heard by any portion of the crowd. His person, whichboasts a somewhat extensive periphery, claimed attention. His office commandedit. His voice retained it.”23 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts23a]Then, the huge choir burst into the “Hallelujah Chorus,” and Cleveland’s largepresidential finger pressed firmly down on a gold-and-ivory telegraph key.A thousand feet away in the vastness of Machinery Hall, an anxious group ofWestinghouse engineers crowded about on the wood-plank floor, holding theircollective breath as the 2,000-horsepower Allis-Chalmers steam engine slowlyroared to life at this touch from the president. The great machine powered theWestinghouse generators, which now pulsed electricity out to the fairgrounds.The engineers knew all was well when they heard the crowd unleash a delightedroar—the three huge fountains at the Court of Honor were working, sendingsplashing plumes of water soaring a hundred feet. A giant Stars and Stripesslowly unfurled and was caught up by a breeze, followed by a rainbow of otherflapping flags and pennants, brilliant banners of flashing color. As the watersprayed, the crowd, cannon, boat whistles, and jangling fog bells combined intoa jubilant caterwauling that rolled through the shimmering heat and across thelake.Chicago’s Columbian Exposition was formally launched. All told, twenty-sevenmillion visitors (half Americans, half foreigners) would pay fifty cents toenter the great fair and experience its astonishments. Above all else, visitorscame to marvel at the fair’s electrical astonishments. Just as GeorgeWestinghouse had hoped, this fair showcased as nothing else ever had the new ageof electricity, with its wonders, both startling and prosaic.Day after day, during the first official week of the 1893 World’s Fair, thecold, rainy deluge returned. This was probably just as well, for despiteBurnham’s best efforts, much of the six-hundred-acre fair was still unready. Buteven as the naysayers gloated over the inauspicious start and prophesiedfailure, the weather warmed, the exhibits were whipped into shape, sultry springzephyrs wafted in off Lake Michigan, and Olmsted’s million trees, shrubs, andplants, planted so artfully about the giant lagoon and sinuous canals, unfurledtheir buds. The people began to arrive, and from the first, they were trulyastounded. Everything about this fair was the biggest, the most astonishing, themost exotic, the most glorious. Over on the lively Midway Plaisance, the fair’ssection for rides and less rarefied pleasures, George Washington Ferris’s greatwheel loomed 250 feet high, the engineering marvel Burnham had hoped wouldeclipse Monsieur Eiffel’s tower at the 1889 Paris Exposition. Altogetherdifferent, the Ferris wheel was equally enchanting. At night, the great wheelglittered in the sky, its gradual (electrically powered) turning outlined withthree thousand light bulbs. More than a million fair visitors would pay fiftycents just to ride in one of the thirty-six shiny Pullman cabins and enjoy twostately revolutions with their incredible views of the nearby smoke-enshroudedChicago and the fair’s fabulous grounds. As they circled slowly around in theair, the Ferris wheel riders could see right below them the exotic Turkishvillage, the delightful German beer garden, and the Cairo street with itscamels, minareted mosque, and Egyptian tombs.Woven through it all was electricity. In one of the many guidebooks, the chiefelectrician boasted, “The Columbian Exposition is a magnificent triumph of theage of Electricity … all the exhibits in all the buildings are operated byelectrical transmission. The Intramural Elevated Railway, the launches that plythe Lagoons, the Sliding Railway on the thousand foot pier, the great FerrisWheel, the machinery of the Libby Glass Company on the Midway, all are operatedby electrically transmitted energy … everything pulsates with quickeninginfluence of the subtle and vivifying current.”24[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts24a] There was even an electrickitchen! Here in Chicago’s Jackson Park, in this planned, short-lived paradise,ordinary men and women still living in rural worlds untouched by any electricalwonders could see for the very first time abundant electricity naturallyemployed in modern daily life, an utterly invisible but supremely powerfulphenomenon put to the most pleasing, startling, and useful effects. “The World’sFair probably comes as near being the electrician’s ideal city as any spot onthe globe,” declared the Review of Reviews.25[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts25a] Writer Hamlin Garland urgentlywrote his father, “Sell the cook stove if necessary and come. You must see thisfair.”26 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts26a] The fair wouldultimately generate and use three times as much electricity as the whole city ofChicago. But the White City was not plagued with the dangerous webs of electricwires that lurked overhead in most big U.S. cities. Burnham had sunk miles ofbig “subways,” roomy enough for men to walk in, reachable by 1,560 manholes.There the electrical wires were tidily and safely ensconced, easy to inspect,and unable to shock (or kill) any unsuspecting souls. Just four years earlier,the 1889 Paris Exposition had used 1,150 arc lights and 10,000 incandescentlamps; the Chicago Exposition had ten times that number in its buildings andgrounds. Paris had generated a grand total of 3,000 horsepower, Chicago 29,000.The White City illuminated at night was a radiant electrical vision longremembered by all who witnessed it, acclaimed as the most fabulous spectacle ina fair brimming with fabulous spectacles. On Monday evening, May 8, as twilightgathered, the Reverend F. Herbert Stead was once again among the crowds ringingthe Court of Honor. The sky darkened to a deep indigo over the lake, and the airgrew perceptibly chillier. Suddenly, the gold-domed Administration Building camebrilliantly to pulsating electrical life, provoking a prolonged sigh of pleasurefrom the crowd. Next, the long classic sweep of the peristyle on the far end ofthe Great Basin burst forth from twilight’s shadow, wondrously luminous with thetens of thousands of Westinghouse “stopper” lamps glowing softly up in thecornices and along the pediment, highlighting the hundreds of statues. The crowdclapped wildly at this bravura burst of electricity. Next, all the white palacesglowed to electric life, radiant visions of an imagined past, followed swiftlyby the thousands of lights encircling the dark waters of the 1,500-foot GreatBasin, its rippling surface now a-shimmer. Hundreds of arc lights lining thewalkways came on, spreading their clear, blue white coronas. Again, the crowdroared its approval. Ghostly gondolas and long electric craft looked like afairy fleet. Then, from the highest roofs swung to luminous life four massivesearchlights, each raking the night sky, even as it shone white, then bloodred,then green, then blue. The people, who had never seen such concentrated,artistic electrical luminosity, let out a steady, breathless chorus of “Oh!” and“Ah!”Then all went dramatically, suddenly dark, and the White City loomed only as aspectral vision. The murmur of the crowd mingled with the sound of the chillyspring winds off the lake. Out of the total blackness, with a rush and a roar,“the great electric fountains lifted their gushing and gleaming waters. Therewere two of these fountains, one on either side of the MacMonnies fountain, andthrough all their many changes each was the counterpart of the other, alike incolor and form.”27 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts27a] The gushingcolored waters formed beautiful shapes and hues. Finally, at 9:30, the lightswere quelled and the electrically dazed and sated crowds drifted slowly home,awed by the transformation of the dark into something so magically new.Yet for all its front-page rhapsodizing about the White City’s first sublimenighttime illumination, the biggest local story in the Chicago Tribune issue ofMay 9 was not the long-awaited triumph of the fair, but the abrupt closing ofthe local Chemical National Bank. It was the first of the fast-widening ripplesof the Panic of 1893. Forty-eight hours after the celebratory opening day ofChicago’s World’s Fair, the nation’s brittle but booming economy began tocollapse in horrifying slow motion. Already that spring, there had been risinguneasiness about the continuing flight of European capital. Then thePhiladelphia & Reading Railroad failed, along with the bloated National Cordagetrust, setting off the May 5 Wall Street panic known as “Industrial BlackFriday.” Three days later, the vice president of Chicago’s Chemical NationalBank said blandly, “Yes, the rumor is true. We found today our cash was runningso low that we decided it would be best to quit.” He claimed depositors wouldlose nothing. The Panic of 1893 was gaining ominous momentum. The Review ofReviews wrote, “Not since 1873 has there been such a critical time. Reports ofbank suspensions and of the failure of old and established financial andcommercial enterprises have been crowding the newspapers. The worst aspect ofthese failures is the seeming needlessness of so many of them…. If people wouldonly think that nothing is wrong, nineteen-twentieths of the problem woulddisappear at once.” The magazine urged President Cleveland to move up to Augustthe extraordinary and early session of Congress he was already calling forSeptember.28 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts28a]Inside the enchanted precincts of the White City during that first month,visitors became well aware that all around them electricity was at work,dazzling with a multitude of lights, powering all variety of engines, andoperating that most amusing of conceits—a long “moving sidewalk” along thesteamboat pier that fairgoers could leap onto and off of at will. But it was theeasy transmission of such great volumes of electricity with alternating currentthat so clearly distinguished this Chicago fair. Here at the ColumbianExposition, Harold Brown’s “executioner’s current” quietly shed that fearfulsobriquet to become the “subtle and vivifying current.” George Westinghouse had,as promised, installed all his AC behemoths in the south nave of Machinery Hall,a vast cavernous space alive with the deafening mechanical clanking and whirringof hundreds of huge machines and unpleasantly redolent of fumes and oil andgrease. Great engines in the Westinghouse nave ran even greater generators,which in turn flashed 2,000 volts of AC from each double Tesla machine forththrough the subways. Once out in the park, these high voltages came down for usevia “converters [transformers] placed in fire-proof and water-proof pits outsidethe buildings, and the secondary wires were led into the buildings invitrified-tile ducts. The largest converter used had a capacity of two-hundredlights, and nearly all were of that size.”29[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts29a]Westinghouse had initially contracted for ninety-two thousand incandescentlights. But no one quite knew how many lights would really be needed or how manymotors. So from the start he had factored in great excess capacity, one of thestrengths of the flexible AC system. Delivering additional power was not a greattrouble. By the time the fair was fully opened and up and running, theWestinghouse Electric Company had installed almost triple the number oflights—250,000 “stopper” bulbs—called for in the original contract. But eachnight only 180,000 of those came aglow, leaving 70,000 as a sufficientelectrical cushion when others burned out. (There were Westinghouse employeeswho did nothing but rush about high in the fair rooftops changing dead lightbulbs.) Many motors were run also. The nerve center for this biggest of ACcentral stations was the highly visible Westinghouse switchboard in MachineryHall, the control panel monitoring the 15,000 horsepower of electricity flashingout to the fair. The switchboard, made out of (noncombustible) marble, was ahundred feet long, ten feet high, and divided into three sections. Accessible byspiral iron staircases and walkways, the switchboard’s many plugs, levers, andwires operated forty circuits so arranged that if one broke, another could besubstituted instantly.“What astonished visitors most, perhaps,” said Westinghouse biographer FrancisLeupp, “was to see this elaborate mechanism handled by one man, who wasconstantly in touch, by telephone or messenger, with every part of the grounds,and responded to requests of all sorts by the mere turning of a switch.”30[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts30a] And that young man maintained acool, easygoing demeanor, as if it were all very simple. Here, finally, at theWorld’s Fair, George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla could beguile the Americanpublic with their shared dream of cheap power, sketching the outlines of theradiant electrical world taking shape, where electricity was cheap anduniversal, changing forever—in ways almost too momentous to imagine—how peoplemanaged the physical world, how they spent their evening hours, the very natureof work and leisure. Here for the first time, millions would see the electricalmotors that would take over the burdensome physical tasks long performed by manor his animals, and the lamps that would light their houses.By the time the Electricity Building was finally ready for its belated openingon the rainy evening of Thursday, June 1, another twenty national banks had gonebelly-up and the newspapers were filled with stories of business failures due to“financial stringency.” But the White City served as an enchanted retreat fromthe impending hard times, and those approaching the Electricity Building throughthe stubborn drizzle that night had their hearts lightened by the loveliness ofthe looming delicate and airy neo-Renaissance white palace. A colossal statue ofBenjamin Franklin attired in colonial frock coat and knee breeches, famous kitein hand, welcomed all who approached. Those walking into the monumentalthree-acre exhibition hall found their eyes briefly overwhelmed by intenseelectric glare: the combined candlepower of thirty thousand incandescent and arclights. Once eyes adjusted, visitors could see the gray evening light filteringin softly through the skylighted vaulted roof high above and many flags andtricolor bunting draped from the second-story balcony. What could not be missedwas General Electric’s large and dominating corporate presence. Most noticeably,there was front and center a towering eighty-foot Columbian column, set atop acharming round Greek pavilion, its top covered with a huge concealing drapery.As visitors came closer to the foot of the tower, they saw that among thepillars of its base, the adorable colonnaded temple, hung hundreds of lovely andhighly artistic Edison light fixtures.Charles Coffin of GE, who had had little use for Thomas Edison as an actualbusiness partner, made sure the public would still associate the new GE with thebeloved inventor and his world-famous name. Therefore, all things Edison weregiven full and extravagant play: Edison’s newest and most amazing invention, theKinetoscope, forerunner of the motion picture, ran a short film of English primeminister William Gladstone delivering a speech in the House of Commons. On theKinetoscope’s screen, he was as real to visitors as if they were watching himthrough a window. A tasteful arena of palms displayed 2,500 different kinds ofEdison incandescent bulbs. Much of the exhibit catered to nostalgia for Edison’shistoric lighting breakthrough, thus establishing the primacy of all Edisoninventions. Yet Edison’s epochal direct current central station was fastbecoming a technology of the past. The future, of course, was what the Wizardwould never have countenanced in an Edison display—the alternating currentcentral station. But because Charles Coffin now ran GE, the firm showcasedvariations of its own alternating current apparatus.One suspects that Westinghouse—who avoided such ceremonies—would have enjoyedthe scene on that wet June night when the cavernous Electricity Buildingformally opened. For as soon as the aisles were suitably full of electricalvisitors and the hour struck 8:15, John Philip Sousa’s band began to smartlyplay his “Picadors March.” All eyes now turned curiously to the towering top ofthe drapery-shrouded GE column. Slowly and ceremoniously, the concealing clothwas pulled away. Great hooting, laughter, and clapping erupted, echoingclamorously off the curved rooftop skylights. For there perched atop the sturdycolumn rose an eight-foot-tall, half-ton Edison incandescent light bulb,shimmering gorgeously through five thousand laboriously installed prisms. It wasnothing less than General Electric’s triumphal monument to the Seven Years’Incandescent Light Bulb War, the corporate victor’s visible and sculpturaldeclaration that the superior light bulb was theirs exclusively. (In keepingwith this triumphant theme, GE displayed the full seven-thousand-page,seven-volume “Filament Case” testimony, a happy sight for any lawyer.) Lovelyand legally instructive as the gargantuan Edison bulb might be, Westinghousewould have appreciated the irony that it was also one of the few Edison bulbs inthe whole vast fair, for everywhere it was his “stopper” lamps that lit thenight.Edison’s column turned out to be almost alive. It could dance! The audiencegasped to see the eighty-foot column come pulsatingly to life. Reported theChicago Daily Tribune, “Electricity danced up and down and all about itscircumference in time with the rhythm of the music. First, slender lines ofpurple fire ran straight up and down its great height. Between them, at the nextmeasure, came waves of crimson flame, and then, cutting up the spaces between ingeometric figures and circling the column from top to bottom, clear dazzlingwhites.”31 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts31a] One man yelled,“Edison!” in thrilled tribute. Others joined, and soon the whole buildingresounded to the delighted chant, “E-di-son, E-di-son, E-di-son.” When at lastthe show ended, the crowds returned to roaming the aisles and alcoves. On themain floor were the major inventors, men like Edison and Tesla and Elisha Gray,whose teleautography machine was a protofax. Upstairs was the purview of lessermortals flogging all kinds of electrical gadgets, many dubious—charged belts fora better sex life, body invigorators, electrical hairbrushes.With such dazzlements at hand, it was perhaps natural that few appreciated theexhibit that was key to the electrical revolution slowly unfolding. This was, ofcourse, the alternating current system of Nikola Tesla set up within theWestinghouse exhibit in the Electricity Building’s north end. Only the mostinformed understood the extraordinary significance of the humble working modelsitting on a long sturdy wooden table. It merited barely any mention in the manywritten popular accounts of electricity at the World’s Fair. Yet here was thetechnology that would soon change the whole world. It included “a generatingstation, a high tension transmission circuit about 30 feet long and a receivingand distributing station. The first contains a 500 h.p. two-phase alternatingcurrent generator, a 5 h.p. direct current exciter, a marble switchboard and thenecessary step-up transformers. In practice the generator and exciter wouldnaturally be driven by water power…. Both generator and wheel are driven by a500 h.p. Tesla polyphase motor with a rotating field, and the exciter by a 5h.p. motor of the same type, both operated by current from the large two-phasealternators in Machinery Hall.”32[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts32a] This collection of machinessignified little to all but the cognoscenti. Here was power at its mostversatile: a single source sending electricity a distance, where it then couldrun incandescent or arc lights, street railways, motors for factories.While only the best-informed electricians appreciated the supreme importance ofthe small working model of Tesla’s AC system, thousands of fair visitorsbreathlessly pressed in around Tesla’s other crowd-pleasing exhibits in theWestinghouse section. There was the whirling Egg of Columbus (this being a largeostrich-size copper egg) such as had so captivated the reluctant Mr. Peck butsix years earlier. The egg vividly demonstrated the rotating fields created bypolyphase currents. The World’s Fair version also included many smaller copper“planets.” All were set to twirling until slowly but surely they all spun to theouter ring of their small electrified universe. Great crowds watched spellboundas seemingly inexplicable forces moved the copper balls inexorably about. Farmore flashy but equally inexplicable to the general public was the eerie andalmost occult darkened Tesla room, a tiny claustrophobic place. Over its entrydoor, a Westinghouse sign emitted brilliant and startling miniature cracklinglightning, followed by a thunderous boom that echoed throughout the noisy hall.Inside, above people’s heads could be seen “suspended two hard-rubber platescovered with tin foil. These were about fifteen feet apart, and served asterminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current wasturned on, the vacuum bulbs or tubes [arrayed about the room], which had nowires connected to them … were made luminous…. Shown by Mr. Tesla in Londonabout two years ago … they produced so much wonder and astonishment.”33[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts33a] Glass tubing formed the names offamous electricians, all hauntingly aglow. As high-frequency currents crackledacross the exhibit, beautiful long fingers of white sparks played across theflat, aluminum-covered surfaces. It was ethereal and magical, as if small piecesof lightning had finally been captured from the heavens and tamed.On the hot Friday of August 25—Colored People’s Day at Festival Hall—the greatabolitionist and leader Frederick Douglass wearily entreated in this era of JimCrow, “All we beg is to receive as honest treatment as those who love only partof the country.”34 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts34a] Over on theSouth Side of Chicago, a ferocious fire, fueled by two huge coal yards, wasroaring its way through 131 buildings, leaving two hundred families homeless. InFreeport, Illinois, yet another bank failed. Seven U.S. deputy marshalstraveling the Rock Island Railway were bound for the Sub-Treasury Building onWall Street, escorting twenty tons of California gold intended to shore upgovernment finances, while at Manhattan’s docks New York police were forciblydispersing striking longshoremen.But in Chicago on that very warm, sultry Friday evening, a thousand electricalengineers and scientists were streaming excitedly into the already hot AssemblyHall in the Agricultural Building, interested in but one thing: Nikola Tesla.“The great majority of those who came,” reported the Chicago Tribune, “came withthe expectation of seeing Tesla pass a current of 250,000 volts through his bodyand perform the marvelous feat with lamps lighted through his body that setParis wild.” Those without seats clamored at the entrance door, vainly offeringas much as $10 to anyone who would sell them a ticket. Of course, those whoreally knew something of electricity now understood that deadliness was measurednot in volts, but in amps. Rumor had it that Tesla was on retainer again toWestinghouse for $5,000 a month.As the electricians in town for their electrical congress waited in the heat forTesla, they could see up on a platform small cylinders of heavy steel mounted onsteel pedestals, all with insulated wooden bases. To the right, a wooden tablewas stacked with strange mechanical appliances. Even the most eminent confessedthey had no idea what many of these objects were. As the crowd settled down,white-haired Elisha Gray escorted Tesla in to a tumult of applause, saying: “Igive you the Wizard of Physics!”Though Tesla (always working long hours) looked gaunt and exhausted, his cheekshollow, his dark eyes sunken, he smiled demurely and joked that manyelectricians had promised to speak, but “when the programme was sifted down Iwas the only healthy man left.” So he was there to lecture on “Mechanical andElectrical Oscillators.” This dry topic encompassed many wonders. Ever thedandy, Tesla was wearing a beautifully tailored gray brown four-button cutawaysuit. For those who noticed, his shoes were unusual—thick soled with what lookedlike cork. The oscillators, he demonstrated, could generate very “precisefrequencies that could be used to transmit information or electrical energy.When the oscillator was pulsating at the frequency of light, he could manifestluminescence as well. And mechanically he could create [and send preciselyoscillating] pulsations through metal bars, or pipes, and test for harmonicfrequencies and standing waves.”35[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts35a] He had also designed steamgenerators so tiny, they could fit in the crown of a derby hat. Tesla madeobjects whirl, flashed huge sparks, lit up all sizes and shapes ofprotofluorescent lights, and, finally, lit up himself, until he was engulfed indazzling streams of light. As the streamers of electricity subsided and Teslawas just fine—a living refutation of Edison’s calumnies against his belovedAC—his brown suit continued to emit “fine glimmers or halos of splinteredlight.”36 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts36a] The amazed audienceburst into furious applause. Tesla had come and conquered!Despite such transcendent moments within the magical precincts of the wondrousChicago World’s Fair, outside in the harsh and sobering light of the real world,the Panic of 1893 was turning into the worst economic disaster in decades. Thefair certainly felt the stringency, and its directors were even more grateful toGeorge Westinghouse for the $500,000 he had saved them. They always made sure hewas paid first, ahead of all other fair creditors. Wrote Francis Leupp, “Whenthe panic was passing through its most acute stage, and the banks were refusingto cash checks because they had nothing to cash them with, the treasury of theFair handed over … to Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company largequantities of dollars and half-dollars and quarters, which were shipped directlyto Pittsburgh, and used to pay off the workmen in the shops at a time whencurrency was commanding five percent premium.”37[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts37a] To everyone’s surprise anddelight, the Westinghouse Electric Company actually turned a small profit of$19,000 on its fair contract. The publicity for AC electricity was, asWestinghouse had anticipated, incalculable.The millions upon millions of fair visitors who had flooded into town hadshielded Chicago through the summer and early fall from the worst blows of thepanic. But by November, Chicago reporter Ray Stannard Baker was writing, “What aspectacle! What a human downfall after the magnificence and prodigality of theWorld’s Fair…. Heights of splendor, pride, exaltation, in one month; depths ofwretchedness, suffering, hunger, cold, in the next.” On the last day of thefair, the city’s beloved four-term roguish mayor, Carter Henry Harrison Sr.,came into the hall of his home to greet a disgruntled young man seeking a job.Instead of a handshake, he found himself fatally shot in broad daylight. On theheels of that jarring tragedy came the grim, ever growing army of unemployed,swelled by those who had built and then run the fair. Writes Chicago historianDonald L. Miller, “Thousands of them roamed the streets, unable, on some nights,to afford a urine-soaked mattress in a ten-cent flophouse.”38[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-nts38a] When Baker the reporter stoppedin late at City Hall one night, he was stunned to see every foot of cold stonefloor space covered by men sleeping on newspapers, wet, worn shoes serving aspillows. By the end of that terrible year, 500 banks across Gilded Age Americahad failed, as had 150 railroads and 16,000 businesses. In Chicago, it had beenthe best of times. Now, as was true across America, it was the worst of times."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_012_r1.jpg]Niagara Falls, Prospect Point, 1890CHAPTER 11Niagara Power: “What a Fall of Bright-Green Water!”As the nineteenth century edged toward its final years, the Niagara Cataract wasstill one of the world’s most celebrated natural wonders, a required destinationfor every genteel and self-regarding tourist, American or foreign. Visitors toNiagara Falls marveled at the powerful torrents thundering so violently down a160-foot cliff that the very earth trembled while rainbows danced high above.The Canadians had the more spectacular, broadly curved Horseshoe Falls on theirside of Goat Island, while the Americans had to content themselves with thenarrower American Falls on their side. The earliest visitors had been uniformlyrapturous in praise of all this tumbling, terrifying, awesome beauty. CharlesDickens arrived on the train straight from Buffalo on a raw April morning in1842. From below the Canadian side, he watched “stunned and unable to comprehendthe vastness of the scene…. Great Heaven, on what a Fall of bright-green water!… Then I felt how near to my Creator I was standing…. Peace of Mind,tranquility, calm recollections of the Dead, great thoughts of Eternal Rest andHappiness … Niagara was at once stamped upon my heart, an Image of Beauty.”1[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts1a] He stayed ten glorious days,watching the oxygenated glass-green Great Lakes water crash over the falls onits journey to Lake Ontario, a man blissfully immersed in the sheer naturalimmensity of water, rumbling earth, mist, and dancing rainbows.Fifteen years later, American landscape artist Frederic Church painted a vastand idyllic vision of the falls, rendered as if one were wading perilously in attheir very top from the Canadian side. Beneath a luminous but glowering sky,Church caught the broad and boiling thunder of the stupendous green falls as itroared into the chasm. The combination of the immediacy and the majesticmesmerized the critics and the public. When Church’s Niagara went on display inNew York City in May of 1857, in just two weeks one hundred thousand peoplewaited patiently in line to see it.This sense of the sacred amid the wilderness that had so enthralled earlyvisitors and that Church had captured so vividly on canvas was, in the yearsleading up to the Civil War, largely gone from Niagara Falls. The railroads madetravel there easy, thus setting off the building of hotels, museums, stables,icehouses, bathhouses, laundries, and curiosity shops catering to the touristdollar. A tawdry and aggressive commercialism engulfed both sides of thefalls—tacky tea gardens, curiosity shops, huge and unlovely hostels, taverns,and viewing towers. The venal Niagara hackmen, vying loutishly for fares,quickly dispelled any pilgrim’s spiritual frame of mind. Where a Charles Dickenshad been content simply to be at Niagara, to literally soak up its sacred aura,others now sought more practical glory there. Most notably were those known as“funambulists,” a Latin word meaning “rope walker.” In the summer of 1859, theGreat Blondin in his pink tights had attracted crowds of twenty-fivethousand—not to admire the booming and foaming great cataract, but to watch himcross a tightrope strung up below the roaring falls. With each crossing, Blondinadded more heart-stopping stunts—carrying his manager across on his back, then asmall stove on which he nonchalantly cooked not one but two omelets a hundredfeet above the chasm, and finally a table to hold his champagne and cake, as hecasually sipped, munched, and balanced on his tightrope.The next summer, as the tourist hordes again swarmed north to escape the heatand enjoy the delights of Niagara, Blondin was weekly challenged by a MonsieurFarini on his tightrope—performing headstands above the roaring waters of thegorge, hanging by toes as onlookers gasped on the Maid of the Mist excursionboat below, crossing the wide gorge while covered by a bulky bag, or taking awashtub, lowering it to gather water, and then studiously washing hankies!Finally, the Great Blondin did what even Farini did not dare: He sidled out ontoa tightrope high above the gorge balancing on stilts—inspired, one suspects, bythe presence of the Prince of Wales. His Royal Highness could only gasp, “ThankGod it’s over!” when Blondin returned to the bank to leap gracefully down.2[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts2a] Stuntmen and daredevils of allsorts would follow, making the falls a mere backdrop. Yet such was Niagara’sreputation that all felt compelled if possible to visit, hoping to recapture therapturous awe of its great waters.Then there were the businessmen, practical sorts who from the start had admiredthe roaring waters but fretted that all that pounding waterpower was going towaste, just tumbling greenly and gorgeously over a 160-foot cliff. One earlyprospectus in 1857 for water wheels lamented “a power almost illimitable,constantly wasted, yet never diminished—constantly exerted, yet neverexhausted—gazed upon, wondered at, but never hitherto controlled.”3[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts3a] One local entrepreneur divertedNiagara water down a canal and by 1882 had as water wheel customers seven smallindustries, including pulp and flour mills and an Oneida silver-plating factory.This nascent industrial activity was the galvanizing event in the 1885 creationof the Niagara Reservation, a New York State government preserve that forbadeall man-made excrescences on its four hundred acres of state land(three-quarters of it submerged) around Niagara Falls.The very restrictions imposed by the new Niagara Reservation inspired Erie Canalengineer Thomas Evershed in the winter of 1886 to propose a wildly ambitiousdream to harness Niagara Falls: a canal water wheel power system whose intakeswould be more than a mile above the falls, well out of sight. There NiagaraRiver water would be siphoned off and surge into a long, broad canal that woulddiverge off at factory and mill sites to feed some two hundred water wheels. TheNiagara water turning each wheel would then discharge straight down one hundredfeet into a two-and-a-half-mile-long sloped tailrace tunnel deep below theramshackle tourist town of Niagara. All the water wheel flow would return to theriver through this tailrace tunnel just below the falls. By June of that year, adozen influential upstate men promised to subscribe to $200,000 in stock in theNiagara River Hydraulic Tunnel, Power and Sewer Company and secured necessarystate charters. In early September, the village of Niagara Falls gave permissionfor the tailrace discharge tunnel to pass far below its streets. Over the nextseveral years, the Evershed group, which never anted up the actual cash fortheir stock holdings, tempted various investors but failed to convince any toactually finance their grandiose plan.But the Niagara men did not give up. They drew in New York attorney WilliamRankine, who had studied law locally before making a name in Manhattan legalcircles. On July 5, 1889, the handsome and debonair Rankine delivered, bringingnorth to the river-cooled Niagara Reservation two highly influential New Yorkmoney men. The first was Edward A. Wickes, a rather fleshy, porcine Vanderbiltrepresentative. The second man was none other than Francis Lynde Stetson, one ofthe most powerful attorneys in America. Scion of a distinguished New York legaland political family, Stetson served as a political confidant to New Yorkgovernor Grover Cleveland in his whirlwind rise to the presidency. Out aspresident after one term, “the Big One” was now one of Stetson’s law partners.So brilliantly had Stetson represented the railroad interests of the Vanderbiltsthat since 1887, J. P. Morgan had Stetson’s firm on permanent retainer. SoFrancis Lynde Stetson was much courted and much feared. Sandy hair side parted,thick mustache topping a skeptical mouth, Stetson always carried about him anaura of intimidating power. His hard-looking eyes appeared as if they easilysized up adversaries.By that September of 1889, with summer gone and both Stetson and Wickes askingagain and again for postponements and concessions as they considered financingthe Evershed plan, the enterprising William Rankine went himself to see J.Pierpont Morgan. The Niagara project would require very large infusions ofcapital. It had been more than a decade since Thomas A. Edison had installed thefirst incandescent lights in Morgan’s cigar smoke–wreathed Wall Street office.Since those days, Morgan had been steadily amassing financial power and personalgirth. In the office, he was as ferocious as ever, and his famed glare daredvisitors to notice an unfortunate development of middle age: a reddened, pittednose, progressively more inflamed by acne rosacea. Morgan, who liked to besurrounded by the aesthetically pleasing, showed a marked partiality for hiringyoung, handsome partners willing to work at a killing pace. Rankine came toMorgan’s office and tried—to no avail—to entice the participation of the greatWall Street financier in this “floundering power enterprise.” But Rankine wasnot one to be deterred. The next day, he reappeared and sought Morgan out again.“Mr. Morgan, you seemed interested in our project until we invited you to joinus. Is there some feature we could change which would make it satisfactory?”Said Morgan, “Your scheme is all right but you have no man to run it.”Replied Rankine, “Whom would you suggest?”“Well, there is Adams. If you can get him, I’ll join you.”4[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts4a]So it was that Edward Dean Adams came to Niagara.Edward Dean Adams was a low-key New York investment banker renowned for hisability to revive and reconfigure crippled railroad companies. Naturally,Morgan, whose financial forte was just this, viewed Adams as a most valuableasset. A short man, Adams looked somewhat like a wise old frog with his heavilyhooded eyes, weak chin, and mouth lost in a huge dark clump of mustache merginginto an odd little chin tuft. While unimpressive in appearance, Adams was afull-fledged Boston Brahmin and descendant of two presidents. He had received ascientific and military education at Norwich College, then attended MIT. In1878, he had become a partner at the exclusive Winslow, Lanier & Company in NewYork, where he was much admired as a brilliantly effective executive andattorney, a man who knew how to make things happen and get things done. In lateryears, the grateful stockholders of the American Cotton Oil trust bestowed asolid gold vase upon him as their rescuer from corporate ruin.Adams had been a major stockholder in the Edison companies since 1884, and hewas indeed quite interested in Rankine’s proposition to take over the stymiedNiagara power project. He, like others, wondered whether the new technology ofelectricity might not play an important role. Adams, who lived with his wife andchildren at 455 Madison Avenue in a mansion not far from Morgan, immediatelyconsulted one of America’s grand old mechanical engineers, Coleman Sellers ofPhiladelphia. On the last day of September 1889, Adams wrote to Sellers thatwhile he knew that electricity had moved forward “with great rapidity,” he wasquite uncertain if it warranted “the investment of a large amount of money,” and“I desire your advice.”5 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts5a] He sentSellers the Evershed prospectus, and by October 5, Sellers was writing that thishuge project based on powering hundreds of time-honored mill wheels did indeedseem financially feasible, but he cautioned Adams to seek further advice fromengineering experts in various fields. As for electricity, Sellers lamented thepaucity of experience with long-distance transmission, telling Adams, “Largeamounts of power have been cheaply sent short distances say two or three miles,and small amounts of power have been sent very much farther than is now underconsideration.” But nothing like the 100,000 horsepower envisioned at Niagarahad been sent as far as the distance between Niagara Falls (population 5,000)and Buffalo (population 256,000)—twenty-six miles.6[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts6a] For surely Buffalo and itsthriving industries were the likely consumers of Niagara power if its form wasto be electrical.By December, Coleman Sellers, a vigorous sixty-two-year-old with a cropped snowwhite beard and big handlebar mustache framing a jolly countenance, hadjourneyed up to Niagara Falls himself to survey the actual site and to conferwith many of the Niagara men promoting the plan. He gave particular attention tothe quality of the rock near the falls, for that would be paramount inexcavating the long tunnel under the town. On December 17, 1889, he sent Adams aseventeen-page report that included actual figures and various proposals toreduce costs, concluding that the project was indeed feasible. He ended bynoting it had been “one of the most interesting engineering problems ever givenme to consider.”7 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts7a] Sellers’senthusiasm sold Adams, and with Adams sold, so were the other New Yorkfinanciers. A syndicate of 103 men, “one of the most powerful combinations ofNew York capitalists … ever … formed,”8[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts8a] invested a total of $2,630,000 inthe Cataract Construction Company. This formidable new firm would transformNiagara’s sublime and mighty flow of tumbling water into the riches of usablepower. While the original Niagara men had little to offer monetarily, it wasconsidered good local politics to retain them all on Cataract’s board.Adams, president of the newly formed and richly financed Cataract ConstructionCompany, now began his organized and methodical search for a solution to oneoverarching question: “How can the power at Niagara best be utilized?” Adamshired the jovial and levelheaded Sellers as his main engineer, along with ahandful of other prominent scientists and engineers to proffer expert advice.Adams and Sellers then sailed to Europe in early 1890 to seek whateverenlightenment was to be had there, for hydropower was far more familiar to theSwiss, French, and Italians, with their Alpine waterfalls. By May 1890, the twoAmericans had crossed the English Channel to travel through all manner of remoteand lovely mountainous regions, examining water wheels and power transmission.Once back in England, Edward Dean Adams persuaded the eminent Sir WilliamThomson, a craggy-faced Scottish mathematician and physicist with a wild bushybeard, to formalize the quest as head of an International Niagara Commission.Thomson had earned his knighthood some decades earlier by making a reality ofthe transatlantic cable and had amassed an enviable fortune serving as theengineer for numerous other submarine cables in places as remote as Brazil. Theother Niagara Commission members were a Who’s Who of continental engineering.The whole raison d’être of the Niagara Commission was to invite engineers fromaround the world to submit their solutions to harnessing Niagara and thentransmitting its bountiful energy. The best would be awarded prizes. It was aningenious way to gather the collective knowledge of the scientific elite.Adams, the wise old frog, and Sellers, the genial dean of mechanical engineers,held court (when not out reviewing Alpine hydro projects) at an elegantchandeliered salon in the posh Brown’s Hotel on Dover Street in London. It wasthere in that June that young Westinghouse engineer Lewis B. Stillwell, also inEurope to survey the state of the electrical art, ventured to first meet Adamsand Sellers. He was accompanied by Reginald Belfield, William Stanley’s onetimeassistant in Great Barrington and now chief electrician for BritishWestinghouse. They emerged from this one meeting in Edward Dean Adams’selectrical salon burning to submit an entry to the Niagara competition. WhenStillwell returned in the fall of 1890 to Pittsburgh and tried to convince hisboss, George Westinghouse famously growled at him, “These people are trying tosecure $100,000 worth of information by offering prizes, the largest of which is$3,000. When they are ready to do business, we will show them how to do it.”9[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts9a] Fourteen proposals were receivedand various prizes dispersed, but the commission merely learned that there wasno obvious solution. Sellers tried to put the best gloss on the situation byreassuring a rather discouraged Adams that it had “brought the scheme before theworld with a prestige that cannot be measured by dollars … and won for itsmanagement respect, as wise, far-seeing cautious business men and not followersof any one visionary schemer or inventor.”10[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts10a]Even as Adams and Sellers and their International Niagara Commission picked thebest engineering brains of Europe, the Cataract Construction Company pressedboldly on with its plans to begin excavating the great tunnel. On October 4,1890, a mellow fall morning, Cataract secretary William Rankine, stylish in hiswell-cut dark vested suit, high collar, and clipped mustache, returned toNiagara Falls to attend the groundbreaking for the tailrace tunnel at the edgeof the New York Central rail yards at Falls Street and Erie Avenue. When thefirst ceremonial shovel of dirt was dug, the warm autumn air resonated withtolling bells of nearby churches and shrieking mill whistles. At long last, thegreat Niagara power project was actually launched.That lovely October morning marked the start of nonstop work, as 1,300 workmendynamited, sledgehammered, steam-shoveled, and pounded round the clock toexcavate the tailrace tunnel. Teams of mules strained as they moved outwagonloads of rock and debris. But the tunnel the men began digging was not thesame design they ultimately built, for Edward Dean Adams and Coleman Sellersboldly abandoned the original plan rooted in the age of steam, a plan thatrelied largely on 238 water wheels strung along the long canal to collectivelyprovide almost 120,000 horsepower. Instead, by the next summer, in July 1891,the two had committed themselves to a radically revised plan, one that extractedall the hydropower from two massive central stations on each side of a longintake canal right off the river. The water was still drawn off above the fallsand still returned to the river via the tailrace tunnel deep under the town. Butnow it was only a mile long, a third the length of Evershed’s scheme. EdwardDean Adams and Coleman Sellers were deeply influenced in this decision by aSwiss-born Englishman named Charles E. L. Brown, who was working for the Swissfirm Oerlikon but would soon leave to begin his own firm, Brown, Boveri &Company. On February 9, 1891, Brown delivered in Frankfurt a seminal talk titled“High Tension Currents,” describing his highly successful experimentstransmitting 100 horsepower of electricity several miles using 30,000 volts.Brown, with a high-domed forehead and rimless glasses, was utterly confident ashe declared, “The transmission of electrical energy by means of current tensionsof, for example, 30,000 volts is possible, the distribution of energy to greatdistances by electrical methods is a fact.”11[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts11a]Shortly thereafter, in mid-December of that year, Adams and Sellers bravelyembraced the age of electricity and invited bids from six companies, threeSwiss, including Brown, Boveri, and three American, those being Westinghouse,Edison General Electric, and Thomson-Houston. The Niagara central stationpowerhouses would no longer turn water wheels attached to shafts and pulleys.Instead, Cataract now planned for ten 5,000-horsepower turbines set deep in eachof two central stations, each water-powered turbine to run an electricalgenerator. The two Niagara stations would generate a mind-boggling 100,000horsepower, equal to all the central stations then operating in America. Neverhad electricity been generated on such a scale. Initially, only one powerhousewould be built and only the first three turbines and three generators installed.As the demand for electricity rose beyond 15,000 horsepower, more turbines andgenerators would be added.Under the new Cataract plan, Niagara’s mighty green waters were to be divertedinto the powerhouse, funneled into eight-foot-wide penstocks (giant pipes), fall140 feet straight down, rush around a crooked “elbow,” and then roar into thedouble wheels of gigantic twenty-nine-ton turbines, the world’s largest. Theseperpetually whirling turbines in the deepest basements of the central stationswould turn attached vertical steel shafts that would twirl the electricalgenerators up on the main floor. Having powered the turbines, Niagara’s waterswould then begin their three-minute journey back to the river, whooshing alongat twenty miles an hour through the 6,800-foot sloping tailrace tunnel. The newplan was extraordinary in its simplicity.More than two hundred feet under the town of Niagara Falls, 1,300 men and theirmachines worked steadily, excavating day and night in the dank, close spaces.The tunnel itself was to be a spacious and elegant marvel, twenty-one feet high,with a gently curved roof, and eighteen feet across. Yet in some sections, waterwas visibly squirting and seeping through the raw tunnel cuts. Eight months andtwo fatal cave-ins after work began, Coleman Sellers ordered the tunnel shoredup with sturdy pine and oak. The tunnel walls would—contrary to initialassumptions—have to be lined. Skilled bricklayers appeared and began to line thetunnel, fitting four layers of hard-burned Buffalo bricks into imported Portlandcement. By the time the 6,800-foot tailrace tunnel was triumphantly completed onDecember 20, 1892, six hundred thousand tons of rock had been hauled out,sixteen million bricks lined the walls, and twenty-eight workers had died. Oncethe great dynamos were operating, all this would be eternally filled with racingriver water. For the last two hundred feet, the curved brick walls gave way tocast iron, and every step brought closer the roar and thunder of American Falls.This immense water tunnel was the largest in the world.Adams, Rankine, and the New York money men, in their methodical way, werecovering all bases. To ensure that there would be adequate customers for theirhydropower (if they could not figure out how to get it cheaply to Buffalo), theyhad quietly purchased almost two miles of land along the river and then inland,an L-shaped 1,500 acres where they envisioned dozens of factories powered bysmokeless hydropower. And to house a portion of the future workers, the New Yorkmen were already planning to construct a small model workers’ town, completewith the electricity that most viewed as a luxury. Adams chose the name Echoata,meaning something akin to “refuge” in Cherokee.Season after season, as the tunnel had been pushing steadily forward under thevillage of Niagara Falls, Adams and Sellers had continued their methodicalconsideration of the electrical state of the art. At any inkling of advance,Cataract dispatched experts to report back. Meanwhile, the fight between AC andDC had been raging year after year. No one group—besides the antagoniststhemselves—could have followed this bitter electrical battle more avidly thanAdams and Sellers and their experts. For who else had so many millions ofdollars already riding on the future of electricity and, especially, the futureof electrical transmission? The initial financing of $2.6 million had expandedsteadily as expenses relentlessly mounted. Within their own Cataract ranks, theAC-DC debate was also being fought. Sir William Thomson remained an ardent anddetermined foe of AC. As of January 1891, so were most of the experts on theInternational Niagara Commission. Coleman Sellers would later describe them as“strongly antagonistic to an alternating current transmission.”12[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts12a] Yet they also knew that despiteall the arguments and accusations, alternating current was winning in thelighting marketplace. A February 1891 issue of Electrical World showed therewere only 202 Edison central stations, all DC, naturally, versus almost 1,000 ACcentral stations installed by Westinghouse and Thomson-Houston.13[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts13a] Coleman Sellers retained an openmind and a propensity toward AC. The truth was, Sellers said in a July 1891lecture at the Franklin Institute, “the progress of invention is going on sorapidly that we are at a loss to know what particular line should be pursued.”14[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts14a]In April 1892, having failed to persuade Charles Brown to set up in NiagaraFalls, Adams and Sellers engaged George Forbes, a rather supercilious Scottishelectrical engineer. Tellingly, his was the one entry in the originalInternational Niagara Commission competition that proposed using alternatingcurrent. Professor Forbes’s first official act was to dismiss the two DC designssubmitted to Niagara by Edison GE and Thomson-Houston. In his report a monthlater, Forbes wrote, “I do not consider that these designs have sufficient meritto induce you to accept any delay in the hopes of getting something more perfectin this direction.”15 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts15a]Certainly, one of the most potent arguments against AC was the lack of aworkable motor. In February of 1892, William Stanley, who had six years earlierset up the first working AC system in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, remindedothers rather snidely that “a commercial AC motor … is a thing unknown to thepractical engineer.”16 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts16a] Or asEdward Dean Adams put it, at this juncture “the Tesla motor was still a prophecyrather than a completely demonstrated reality.”17[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts17a] How could Cataract profess to beplanning a power plant—as opposed to a lighting plant—if its electricity couldnot run motors? But this greatest of stumbling blocks was about to besurmounted. Very quietly and out of the limelight, the Tesla single-phase ACmotor was finally distinguishing itself as a working commercial reality.The proving ground for the Tesla AC motor was notably tough: the rugged andarcticlike San Juan Mountains of Telluride, Colorado. There, the owners of thefinancially ailing Gold King Mine had to find cheap energy or close. Havingheard of Tesla and his AC system, they inquired of the Westinghouse Company inthe spring of 1891 if electricity could be generated three miles away down inthe valley, where a 320-foot waterfall could operate a water wheel. If awater-powered generator could indeed transmit electricity twelve thousand feetup the mountain to run a motor in the stamping and crushing mill above thetimberline, the mine might be saved. The mine was quickly running out of nearbywood, and importing coal was too expensive. Westinghouse sold Gold King Mine asingle-phase alternator (the phrase then for an AC generator) early that summer,and by June it was housed in a wooden shack next to the falls and its new waterwheel. From this shack, 3,000 volts of electricity traveled on $700 worth ofcopper wire strung up and across three miles of steep, hardscrabble mountainterrain. At the mill the electricity was stepped down to power a 100-horsepowersingle-phase Tesla motor. The question was—would it run reliably? So all thatsummer, fall, and winter, and all through 1892, the Westinghouse engineers weredelighted as the simple power system and the sturdy motor hummed steadily along,surviving the mountain’s usual severe electrical storms, high winds, blizzards,and avalanches. The Tesla AC system had passed its first real job with flyingcolors.In June of 1892, a jubilant Charles Scott, the young Westinghouse engineer whohad assisted Tesla when he’d first come to Pittsburgh, announced this firstsuccessful commercial use of the whole Tesla system, including the longproblematic induction motor, in the Electrical Engineer. “The aggregate timelost … was, by actual count, less than 48 hours during three-fourths of a year….This success is confirmed in a substantial way by the immediate extension[expansion] of the plant. A 50 h.p. motor is now being installed at a mill a fewmiles from the Gold King … work in this field is fast passing from experimentalinvestigation into practical electrical engineering.”18[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts18a] At long last, the Tesla motorhad arrived, operating off a Tesla-designed generator. In the same triumphantarticle, Scott also described how for two years a forty-foot waterfall on theWillamette River had powered a big Tesla AC generator, which sent electricitythirteen miles to their electric lighting central station in Portland, Oregon.Here at last the Tesla polyphase system had begun in the smallest of ways tofulfill its long touted promise. But above all, there was now a working Tesla ACinduction motor, albeit single-phase. The last great AC hurdle had beenovercome.As the Cataract Construction Company pushed steadily ahead upstate at NiagaraFalls, New Yorkers in Manhattan were reveling in what was shaping up to be oneof the city’s juiciest, messiest scandals ever. It had all begun the previousmonth when the thickly bewhiskered Reverend Charles Parkhurst stood in hispulpit at the Madison Square Presbyterian Church and accused the city’s Tammanymayor and police department of being part of an “official and administrativecriminality that is filthifying our entire municipal life, making New York avery hotbed of knavery, debauchery and bestiality.” Hauled by the Tammany DAbefore a grand jury to prove these intemperate charges of vice run amok amidpolice complicity, Reverend Parkhurst had to admit he could offer none. The goodreverend emerged from this public humbling determined to gather the necessaryevidence. He hired Charles Gardner, a private detective, who agreed to leadParkhurst and two others on a tour of Manhattan’s darkest dives.Disguised as “toughs,” the foursome rode the Third Avenue el from 18th Streetdown to Franklin Square and began their education in Manhattan lowlife, startingoff with “a whisky saloon, an opium den in Chinatown, a stale beer dive in theItalian section, and other horrors…. In a Tenderloin house, five girls strippedand did a ‘dance of nature.’ … At Scotch Ann’s Golden Rule Pleasure Club on West3rd … they found it subdivided by partitions into cubicles … in which sat a boywith a painted face.”19 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts19a] As anappalled Parkhurst and his two companions toured every kind of beer-soaked dancehall, cheap saloon, and sleazy brothel, they became astonished, genteelwitnesses to a large and rowdy underworld thriving on illicit gambling, cheapliquor and beer, and organized, commercial sex catering to every kind ofappetite. Gardner also had his own detectives out gathering affidavits. So whenReverend Parkhurst mounted his pulpit a mere month later on Sunday, March 13,1892, he possessed documented evidence that Tammany was “rotten with arottenness that is unspeakable and indescribable.” He had proof that 254 saloonsand 30 brothels had been roaring with business just the previous Sunday. In theensuing months, a grand jury handed down a few placating indictments, but littlewould change immediately. The urban poor (and a certain number of theirbetter-off confreres) wanted jollity and dazed forgetfulness, be it craps, bawdydance halls, or cheap, quick sex, for theirs were hardscrabble lives. And therewere great sums to be made, as Tammany showed, in organized vice. A few outragedcitizens were, for the moment, but an annoyance.While Reverend Parkhurst was roiling the murk of the Manhattan underworld tolittle avail, George Westinghouse was informing Edward Dean Adams that he wouldindeed bid on the Niagara contract. That done, Westinghouse turned his attentionto his ongoing crusade to best GE for the Chicago World’s Fair lightingcontract, “the largest electrical project ever undertaken” up to that time.While Parkhurst achieved little but frustration, Westinghouse emerged from hisbattle in mid-May with his lowball contract in hand. Westinghouse thenconcentrated full bore throughout the second half of 1892 on building the fairsystem, knowing that if it worked, it would well serve his pursuit of theNiagara contract. Since most of the Chicago World’s Fair AC electricity was forlighting, the young Charles Scott proposed they stick with the tried-and-truesingle-phase for the tens of thousands of incandescent “stopper” lights. ButWestinghouse said, “No, they have been telling me that the two-phase is theright system and I want to find out whether it is or not.”20[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts20a] So the Westinghouse engineersdedicated themselves to creating commercially viable two-phase, somethingpossible only because they finally conceded what Nikola Tesla had insisted on in1888—AC induction motors could not function if the frequency was too high. AsCharles Scott so dryly put it, “Commercial circuits were single-phase at afrequency of 133 cycles. Strenuous efforts to adapt the Tesla motor to thiscircuit were in vain. The little motor insisted on getting what it wanted, andthe mountain came to Mahomet. Lower-frequency polyphase generators inflictedobsolescence on their predecessors in a thousand central stations—such was thepotency of the Tesla motor.”21 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts21a]Without these new AC generators, the new AC motors would not be an option forWestinghouse customers.The Westinghouse Electric Company now set standard AC frequencies of 60 cyclesper second for lighting and 30 cycles for motors. Nikola Tesla once again joinedthe Westinghouse effort. In late September of 1892, he was urgently orderingvarious apparatus from Pittsburgh “to carry out some improvements on my motor,”noting that “time is very precious.”22[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts22a] He asked that all be deliveredto his fourth-floor laboratory on South Fifth Avenue, a loft building in theramshackle commercial and industrial area. By December of 1892, Westinghouse hadsubmitted its two-phase AC design for Niagara to the Cataract Company. GE’sentry came in soon thereafter, with a design similar in all ways but that itemployed three-phase AC.Up at Niagara Falls, the gargantuan Cataract construction project blasted andrumbled onward. In December 1892, the tailrace tunnel had been completed. ByJanuary of 1893, Professor Forbes was writing in the Electrical Engineer thatthe big intake canal “about a mile and a half above the American Fall … has beendug out 500 feet wide, and 1,500 feet long, with a depth of 12 feet. Along theedge of this canal wheel pits are being dug 160 feet deep, at the bottoms ofwhich the turbines will be placed. The water is admitted to the penstocks bylateral passages (or head-races) which can be closed by gates.”23[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts23a] The other notable event atNiagara Falls that January was “the most ample and substantial” ice bridge inalmost three decades, since the winter of 1855. Reported The New York Times,“The steady zero weather of the past week has filled the upper river with icewhich is pouring over the falls in vast quantities and adding each hour to thejam which is called the ‘bridge.’ … The heavy fall of snow and the clouds ofmist from the Falls, which settle on top, freezing as fast as they fall, form anatural cement.”24 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts24a]Day after day that January, the river ice crashed over the falls, until thegorge below became a fantastical arctic landscape, a massive shifting, grindingice field, dazzling in the winter sun and gorgeous with its towering white icemountains. Hundreds of tourists bundled in dark winter coats and cloaks, womenand girls with fanciful fur hats and muffs, streamed out onto the broad ridgesof the ice bridge, tiny dark figures laughing and shouting as they gazed up atthe beauteous sight of the falls frozen into hundreds of gigantic craggyicicles. Professor Forbes, who was at Niagara later that winter, marveled that“the precipices are concealed behind icicles 60 feet long. Every rock in theriver is the nucleus for a dome of frozen spray rising 150 feet.”25[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts25a] On cold wintry mornings, all thetrees and bushes near the river were encased in a shimmering coat of ice, andvisitors felt they had entered a wondrous fairyland. But the river ice had aprosaic and serious side, and keeping it out of the power plant machinery would,some winters, prove a brutal struggle.While the ice bridge and the thrilling danger of walking across its evershifting, dazzling landscape was attracting winter tourists to Niagara, Cataractconsultants were visiting the sprawling, noisy Westinghouse electrical plant inPittsburgh. From January 9 to 13, 1893, Coleman Sellers and Johns Hopkinsphysics professor Henry Rowland, another Cataract consultant, observed andsubjected to many tests the new Westinghouse AC generators and transformers,assessing if they were suitable to this biggest of all electrical projects. Theywatched the working of a new rotary converter that could turn AC into DC(important for street trolleys), measured safety and switching apparatus,observed how too low frequencies would make lights flicker, and tested motors.Sellers came away very favorably impressed and in his report noted, “A carefulexamination of the work done in this establishment showed excellent workmanshipand correct engineering design in all the machinery examined…. The workmanshipis beyond criticism in quality.”26[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts26a] In his report, Professor Rowlandconcluded that Westinghouse had “the greatest experience in the practical use ofthe alternating system and they seem to control the most important patents.”27[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts27a]The next month, the two men visited the General Electric plant in Lynn,Massachusetts, and Sellers noticed how similar—but by no means equal—the GEapparatus was to the Westinghouse equipment. He noted that “very considerablechange would have to be made to make it mechanically the equal.” Moreover, hewas very leery of GE’s proposed use of three-phase AC, saying, “I should inclineto the biphase on account of its greater simplicity and its adaptability to abroader field of usefulness.” Knowing that Professor Forbes, who was annoyinglyaway in England during these crucial visits to Westinghouse and GE, favored theAC design of the Swiss firm Brown, Boveri, Coleman Sellers ended histwenty-five-page report sent from his Baring Street office in Philadelphia thus:“I do most earnestly protest against the purchase of the foreign plant if asgood electrical results can be anticipated from the home made machine, even ifthe first cost is seemingly greater.”28[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts28a] Aside from his patrioticchauvinism, Sellers the engineer could not see how a foreign firm could fix andmaintain the inevitable problems in a timely fashion.Not surprisingly, the AC patent issue was looming larger and larger. As ColemanSellers bluntly told Edward Dean Adams, “Until the contrary is proved by thecourts, [Westinghouse] claims control of what is most important for our purposeat the present time in America. I am not aware of any claim to ownership in thiscountry of what can stop the owners of the Tesla patents from commanding themarket…. My present opinion is that no foreign company can secure the CataractConstruction Co. against all losses from patent litigation.”29[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts29a] The previous month, February,Edward Dean Adams, from his office on the fourth floor of the prestigious MillsBuilding, had begun a private correspondence with Nikola Tesla, seeking hisopinion on a variety of electrical matters, often about whether reports sent toAdams were technically correct. Other times, he was grappling to betterunderstand the new AC technology, such as Tesla’s synchronous and multiphasemotors. Tesla, acutely aware that George Westinghouse was vigorously competingfor the Niagara power contract, used his private letters to Adams (scrawled onstationery from his new residence, the Gerlach Hotel) to press home again andagain the broad scope of his AC patents. The inventor’s message was clear: Ifany other company said it could provide a multiphase AC generator and, aboveall, AC motors that would then power factories, they were infringing on hisWestinghouse patents. In a February 2 letter, Tesla wrote, “I have not heardfrom Germany yet, but I have not the slightest doubt that all companies exceptHelios,—who have acquired the rights from my Company,—will have to stopmanufacture of phase motors. Proceedings against the infringers have been takenin the most energetic way by the Helios Co. It is for this reason that ourenemies are driven to the single phase system and rapid changes of opinion.”Modesty played no part in Tesla’s self-confident missives to Edward Dean Adams,a financier so influential, so utterly critical in deciding whether Nikola Teslawould live out one of his oldest, most cherished electrical dreams. While inhigh school, Tesla would later recall, “I was fascinated by a description ofNiagara Falls I had perused, and pictured in my imagination a big wheel run bythe Falls. I told my uncle I would go to America and carry out this scheme.”30[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts30a] In fact, Tesla had devisedsomething far more original than a water wheel, and now the decision about thecontract hung in the balance. He lost no opportunity to trumpet his advantages.When Adams inquired whether a Thomson-Houston patent might be comparable toTesla’s, the inventor asserted in a March 12 letter that this patent had“absolutely nothing to do with my discovery of the rotating magnetic field andthe radically novel features of my system of transmission of power disclosed inmy foundation patents of 1888. All the elements shown in the Thomson patent werewell known and had been used long before.” When Adams sought his opinion on a DCsystem, Tesla wrote on March 23, barely able to contain his horror at “howdisadvantageous, if not fatal, to your enterprise such a plan would be, but I donot think it possible that your engineers could consider seriously such aproposition of this kind.”31 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts31a]And in fact, on May 6, 1893, the officers of the Niagara Falls Power Companydeclared unequivocally that polyphase alternating current would be their choice.This was, at the time, still a very bold and highly controversial stance. Theeminent Sir William Thomson, chairman of the International Niagara Committee andjust elevated to become Lord Kelvin by Queen Victoria, cabled Adams on May 1 tohead off the announcement. He proposed an ambitious DC plan, urging, “Trust youavoid gigantic mistake of adoption of alternate current.”32[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts32a] Edward Dean Adams, in histwo-volume history of the Niagara Falls Power Company, noted how much thatmomentous decision was based on “faith and hope that electrical engineers couldproduce apparatus much larger in size than ever had been built and that newtypes which were then hardly beyond the stage of experiment would provesuccessful.”33 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts33a] After all, onwhat did they truly base this leap of faith, this major commitment of many(steadily mounting) millions of their own hard cash? The “outstanding actualachievement in power transmission was at Telluride,” where the gold minestamping mill had been running for two years now, sending, in truth, piddlingamounts of power up through rugged mountains to run a small motor. Then therehad been a highly successful—but nonetheless experimental—demonstration at the1891 Frankfurt Exposition, where power was transmitted one hundred miles.Then, of course, there was the triumph of the just opened Chicago World’s Fair,with the nighttime Court of Honor awash in dazzling electricity. Wrote Adams,“The construction of twelve polyphase alternators of a thousand horsepower eachand the electrical illuminations of a great White City for the first time inhistory were great events, but they were overshadowed in real significance by amore important though less spectacular exhibit.”34[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts34a] That was, of course, the workingmodel of Nikola Tesla’s universal AC power system, with its AC generator,transformers, transmission lines, working induction motors, synchronous motor,and Westinghouse-invented rotary converter that supplied direct current for therailway motor. George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla had finally convinced theNiagara engineers and millionaires, many of whom had been deeply skeptical, someoutright hostile, that alternating current truly was the ideal for creating anddistributing power in the coming age of electricity. And so, in the spring of1893, as the Chicago World’s Fair opened, Westinghouse and Tesla verged oncomplete electrical triumph, with the great Niagara dream tantalizingly withintheir grasp.Their chief American rival for this sought-after prize, this ultimate showcaseof electrical power, was, of course, GE, the much maligned electrical trust. Forsome time, George Westinghouse had been wrathfully suspicious that GE wasstealing his company’s hard-won, highly valuable mechanical and electricalknowledge. Even though all Niagara submissions were supposed to be completelyconfidential, he had discovered the incredible similarity between his and GE’sNiagara plans, something mentioned by Sellers in his report to Adams. (GE hadvaried its design only by making it triple-phase.) In early May, one of theWestinghouse engineers learned that the Westinghouse Company’s blueprints andmany documents about prices, labor costs, and other privileged information wereindeed at GE’s Lynn plant. George Westinghouse immediately sought a searchwarrant, and GE was caught red-handed. Westinghouse had one of his draftsmenarrested for secretly selling the firm’s World’s Fair and Niagara blueprints forthousands of dollars to two GE men, one a general superintendent in the GErailway department. GE insisted they were only trying to see if Westinghouse wasinfringing on their patents. The Pittsburgh district attorney happily announcedthe discovery of this “conspiracy” May 8, 1893, and his intention to seek grandjury indictments of not just the underlings on both sides, but the eminentCharles Coffin, GE’s president and top executive.35[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts35a]Coffin was furious and quickly wrote an assuaging letter to his financiers,saying to Vanderbilt son-in-law Hamilton McK. Twombly, “I hope you are notdisturbed … while it is altogether probable that some of their blue prints mayhave been in our possession, it was absolutely without my knowledge orsanction…. If there be any similarity between their [Niagara] plans and ours …it is purely accidental. Be that as it may, there is an implied charge againstthe Niagara Co. of very bad faith [not keeping each submission confidential] inthe statements of the Westinghouse Co…. It is part of the bitter andvituperative work of the Westinghouse people…. [They] will distinctly loseprestige and business as the result of their ridiculous behavior in connectionwith this matter.”36 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts36a] (When thecase went to trial that fall, Coffin was no longer a defendant and thePittsburgh jury deadlocked.)But galling as the spying case was to George Westinghouse, it paled incomparison with the perfidious deed that came next. On May 11, Edward Dean Adamsand the Cataract Construction Company dropped a large, unexpected, andoutrageous bombshell. Adams wrote a one-page missive to each of the fourelectrical companies still competing—GE and Westinghouse in America and Brown,Boveri and Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon in Europe—coolly informing them that theirservices were no longer needed. The Niagara dynamo contract, this mostglittering, sought-after, and prestigious of electrical prizes, was not going toany of them. Instead, the Cataract Company, having had the privilege ofexamining every aspect of these four firms’ proprietary electrical designs,having availed themselves of the companies’ best men and technical advances, wasnow appointing their own electrical consultant, Professor George Forbes, todesign a generator to accommodate its 5,000-horsepower water turbines.Most outrageous, these designs by Professor Forbes, said Adams, “are welladvanced,” which meant that even as Westinghouse, GE, Oerlikon, and Brown,Boveri engineers were struggling to solve and overcome all manner of obstaclesfor Niagara and discussing these with Sellers and Rowland and Forbes, Cataractwell knew that Professor Forbes was already working on a generator. Adams hadthe gall to inform the rejected American bidders that “we expect to submit thesame to you, as well as to others, for proposals for construction within a briefperiod. Please accept our sincere thanks for the response you have made to ourinvitations for proposals.”37 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts37a]One of the world’s most eminent electricians, Silvanus Thompson, later expressedthe profession’s collective outrage, denouncing Cataract’s blatant and“ungenerous picking of the brains of others.” He deemed this “contemptiblecollaring of rival plans … the one discreditable episode the savour of whichwill ever cling about the undertaking.”38[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts38a]Adams, ever the gentleman even as he dished out such bitter soup, wrote Tesla tolet him know that Professor Forbes would design the dynamo, not Westinghouse orGE, and also indicated his own Brahmin ire over the sordid public airing ofGE-Westinghouse spying charges. Tesla, himself ever the gentleman, replied thatsame day, dismissing the GE spying brouhaha as “a trifle, to be sure, not worthyof any consideration.” The elegant Serbian inventor was the soul of cordiality,writing from his comfortable suite at the Gerlach Hotel on West 27th Street(conveniently around the corner from Delmonico’s, the gastronome’s delight), “Ican assure you that your decision does not in the slightest affect my sympathiesand my sincere wishes that your magnificent enterprise may meet with the successit deserves.”But after these pleasantries, Tesla got down to business, which was to stronglywarn Adams he “could not help seeing difficulty ahead.” The obvious problemswere that Cataract had been shown “in good faith” Westinghouse plans based on“long continued experience and items on the subject not found in any treatise onengineering,” and of course, there were Tesla’s patents and the manyWestinghouse improvements developed since to make them commercially ready. Thisuncomfortable fact would, Tesla indicated, make it very difficult for ProfessorForbes to design a noninfringing alternating current system. This wassufficiently worrying to Adams that he passed it along to Coleman Sellers inPhiladelphia. Sellers advised letting Tesla know that it was Cataract’sintention to redesign the generators to better suit the turbines and then goback to the “competitors, with the expectation that they can find it to theiradvantage to aid us in the development.”39[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c11-nts39a] And there the matter rested,leaving a residue of bitter ill will."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_024_r1.jpg]Niagara Falls Power Company horse and wagonCHAPTER 12“Yoked to the Cataract!”All the dappled summer of 1893, Professor George Forbes lived at Niagara andworked on the Cataract dynamo design. “I had a lovely house in parklike grounds… on the banks of the placid river above the upper rapids,” he later wrote. “Iwent to bed early and rose at five or six in the morning, and I shall neverforget the delights of those glorious summer mornings at one of the mostbeautiful sites in the whole neighborhood.” From time to time, Professor Forbessquired around visiting electricians en route to or from the World’s Fair whoalso wished to see the marvels of the Great Falls and Cataract’s progress on itsmammoth power project. The gigantic wheel pits at Power House No. 1 were welladvanced, and soon the three mighty turbines would be installed deep in itsbowels. Highly favored visitors were treated to the clammy stygian walk throughthe completed mile-and-a-quarter tailrace tunnel from the powerhouse down to theroaring river gorge.Professor Forbes, a tall, supercilious Scotsman with fair hair, a large nose,and a mustache, had very few kind words for his Cataract engineering colleagues.His attitude toward most things American could be summed up in one word:condescension. He preferred to live on the Canadian side of the falls anddisdained the nearby town of Niagara Falls as “dirty … [and full of] cheaprestaurants, merry-go-rounds, itinerant photographers, and museums of Indiansand other curiosities.”1 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts1a] Forbesclearly gloried in his high-profile, plum assignment as Cataract’s consultingelectrical engineer, a man central to the world’s most ambitious, expensive, andclosely watched electric power project. Yet he petulantly complained thatdesigning the Niagara dynamo that summer and generally carrying out thetechnical aspects of his work were made far more difficult by “politics,” whichhe described as “intriguing, underhand dealing and jobbery.”2[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts2a] The haughty Forbes was quick totake sole credit for work that was highly collaborative or others’ entirely.As the August heat clamped down on the eastern seaboard that summer of 1893,Coleman Sellers and Edward Dean Adams felt growing pressure to move ahead. TheCataract investors had anted up $4 million thus far for this vast enterprise,all of which now hinged on a workable AC generator. Niagara was a hugeinvestment of purely private capital, a fact acutely felt as the Americaneconomic system was slowly and disastrously imploding. No day of the gloriouslylovely summer passed without more terrifying news—bank failures rolled fromregion to region, farmers in the far West could not ship their crops for lack ofcredit, railroads slid into receivership. Even the mightiest millionaires had tolook closely to their accounts. One associate described how “every morning whilein New York Mr. Rankine has submitted to him a statement showing the exactbalance in the bank of the Cataract Construction Company, Niagara Falls PowerCompany, Niagara Falls Water Works Company, Niagara Development Company, and theNiagara Junction Railway Company. When he is here at the Falls this statement ismailed to him.”3 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts3a] J. P. Morganwrote a friend in late July that summer, “Everything here continues blue asindigo. Hope we shall soon have some change for the better, for it is verydepressing and very exhausting.”4 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts4a]As the financial markets teetered on the brink, the U.S. Congress convened inemergency session on August 7, and Grover Cleveland, the only president toreturn to office for a second term after being defeated following his first,urged the legislators to repeal the parity of silver with gold.Days later, on August 10, 1893, Coleman Sellers, now president of the NiagaraFalls Power Company and its chief engineer, wrote both GE and Westinghouse toannounce that Professor Forbes had designed a suitable dynamo and transformers.Therefore Cataract was again looking for a firm to manufacture and install itsgenerating equipment. George Westinghouse, still seething from the earlierdismissal, wrote Sellers a stiff reply a week or so later from Pittsburgh,reminding this genial engineer who had seemed to so favor his firm, “We havegiven several years time to the development of power transmission, and havespent an immense sum of money working out various plans, and we believe we arefully entitled to all the commercial advantages that can accrue to us … we donot feel that your company can ask us to put that knowledge at your disposal sothat you may in any manner use it to our disadvantage.”5[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts5a] Nonetheless, Westinghouserelented. After all, this was still the great Niagara Falls power project, hisdearest electrical dream, a world showcase for alternating current. He hadpushed forward through far worse. Then, of course, there was the work this wouldguarantee for his men, at this grim time when every factory was watching itsorders plummet.So George Westinghouse dispatched a couple of his top engineers, one of thesebeing Lewis Stillwell, to Niagara Falls on August 21 to see just what ProfessorForbes had come up with. As the two men came off the train, the resort wasjammed with tourists in a holiday mood, enjoying the merry-go-rounds, clamberingabout the falls and the Cave of the Winds, riding the Maid of the Mist. Theengineers’ mood was nowhere as jolly. The Scotsman’s dynamo design, they wouldsoon conclude, was so hopelessly flawed that they could not considerconstructing it. After studying the blueprints thoroughly, they told ColemanSellers that “mechanically the proposed generators embodied good ideas … [but]electrically it was defective and if built as designed … would not operate.”6[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts6a] Historian Harold Passer summed upthe flaws in Forbes’s generator as these: such low frequency—162⁄3 cycles asecond—that it would cause noticeable flickering in lights; worse yet—for aproject aimed at providing industrial power—it would be “too low forsatisfactory operation of most polyphase power equipment [notably theall-important rotary converter to change AC to DC]. The Westinghouse engineersalso sharply criticized the high-generating voltage [an unheard-of 22,000]. Theinsulation problems would be difficult to solve and perhaps impossible.”7[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts7a]The haughty Professor Forbes seemed to have forgotten during his delightfulsummer sojourn in Niagara the whole point of AC. Letters were exchanged and anegative report made to George Westinghouse. Then on September 15 two topWestinghouse engineers, one again being Lewis Stillwell, returned once more tothe ramshackle precincts of Niagara, where the last tourists still lingered onin the chill of early fall. The engineers met first with Sellers and otherCataract experts and once again talked about the shortcomings of the Forbesdynamo. They then proceeded to Professor Forbes’s office, where, Sellers laterrelated, “Professor Forbes discussed some of the questions raised and declinedto take up others, stating that he had fully considered the subject and was surehe was right.”8 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts8a]Coleman Sellers and Edward Dean Adams well knew that they could not move forwardwithout George Westinghouse and his patents and know-how. (Adams seemed to viewGE’s bid merely as a means to keep the overall price down.) And now the topWestinghouse engineers had returned from repeated Niagara inspections ofForbes’s dynamo blueprints oozing contempt for Cataract’s design. Soothingruffled corporate feathers was, however, Adams’s forte. He had made his name asan attorney bringing together angry and fractious railroad investors andrailroad officers and convincing these hissing rivals to agree on their jointsalvation. So in early October he proposed a dinner in a comfortable privatedining room at the venerable Union League Club, one of Manhattan’s mostexclusive men’s clubs, formed during the Civil War to support the North. Thatevening, the millionaires and engineers gathered in their formal dinner clothesand over many sumptuous courses reviewed every contentious aspect of theproposed Cataract dynamo contract with Westinghouse.By the time the cigars and brandy were served, the two sides had come to termson everything but frequency, with Cataract clinging loyally to Forbes’s too lowfrequency of 162⁄3 and Westinghouse insisting it could not guarantee any dynamoof less than 30 cycles. Decades later, Westinghouse engineer Benjamin Lammewrote, “There was more or less of a deadlock on the question of frequency…. [We]did not wish to build such a machine, due to the great probability of completefailure from the operative standpoint.”9[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts9a] As the dinner broke up, Adamspulled aside Lewis Stillwell, the chief Westinghouse engineer. Could theycompromise at 25 cycles? The eventual answer turned out to be yes. On October27, 1893, three days before the Chicago World’s Fair was coming to a triumphantend, George Westinghouse finally had in hand the coveted contract that hadslipped away from him earlier in the spring. He and Nikola Tesla would finallyshow the world what real electrical power could be.By the end of that year, 1893, the whole Westinghouse camp was united on twomatters: perfecting the generators for Niagara Power House No. 1 and visceraldislike and distrust of Professor George Forbes. In the wake of the professor’smisguided dynamo design, they doubted his electrical competence and viewed himas a decided impediment to their job. Nor did they appreciate his condescension.The ever genial Coleman Sellers found himself uncomfortably in the middle, forin December of 1893, George Westinghouse announced in his usual definite anddecisive way that he and his men simply would not work with Professor Forbes(soon to return from a Christmas dash across to Great Britain). Westinghouse nowsaw Forbes as “a possible rival in dynamo design” based on a lecture Forbes haddelivered, and he had no intention of providing the professor any edge. Sellerswrote a rather anguished private memo to Adams about this “very delicate matter”right after Christmas and blamed Forbes for being away “when the most importantmeasures are to be decided.” He wanted Adams to be fully aware of the “absoluteunwillingness” of Westinghouse to have dealings with Forbes.10[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts10a]After a February 6, 1894, meeting in Manhattan with George Westinghouse and twoof his engineers, Edward Wickes reported to Adams that the Pittsburgh magnatewas unyielding on Forbes. It created, he conceded, “considerable difficulty. Wemust get along the best way we can.”11[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts11a] The upshot was that ColemanSellers largely sidestepped Forbes from that time forward. Professor Forbes,whose dynamo design had been thoroughly lambasted by American engineers when hepresented it at various engineering forums, did not appreciate his diminishedCataract status. (Charles E. L. Brown, head of the Swiss firm Brown, Boveri,formally accused the Scotsman of copying the unique umbrella-style-design dynamohe had submitted to Cataract in late 1892.)12[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts12a]In a parting shot at Cataract for trifling with him, Professor Forbes penned asubtly poisonous article on Niagara for Blackwood’s, an English magazine, thenext year. Predictably, he portrayed himself as the presiding engineering geniusbehind the great power project and the Americans largely as annoyingignoramuses. Forbes wreaked some measure of revenge when he airily explained, “Ihad at times great difficulty in keeping the president and vice presidents inhand…. Most of them began to think they knew something about the subject…. Allthis was generally amusing enough, but became almost tragic at times when Ifound them endangering the whole work. On such occasions I would write to mymillionaires and tell them that if they did not do what I told them they wouldbe personally answerable to the directors and shareholders for any disaster thatmight occur.”13 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts13a]All through 1894, the engineers at the Westinghouse Electric & ManufacturingCompany were engaged in the mammoth yet delicate task of fine-tuning the designsand starting to build the first two of Niagara’s 5,000-horsepower generators,completely new kinds of machines five times bigger than those at the World’sFair, which themselves at 1,000 horsepower had been considered behemoths. Thethird would be finished only when the first two had been shown to work properly.In its report on the contract, Westinghouse emphasized the great novelty ofalmost all the machinery: “The switching devices, indicating and measuringinstruments, bus-bars and other auxiliary apparatus, have been designed andconstructed on lines departing radically from our usual practice. The conditionsof the problem presented, especially as regards the amount of power to be dealtwith, have been so far beyond all precedent that it has been necessary to devisea considerable amount of new apparatus…. Nearly every device used differs fromwhat has hitherto been our standard practice.”14[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts14a] The original intended size andscale of the generators had to be reduced to ensure that they could be hoistedonto a railroad flatcar and transported safely to Niagara.image [images/Jonn_9781588360007_epub_078_r1.jpg]Westinghouse Tesla Polyphase System exhibited in the Electricity Building at theChicago World’s Fair of 1893.

Without a job, howwere they to live? And anyone could look around and see only crushingunemployment. All spring the coalfields had been racked by strikes as 170,000angry miners whose wages had been slashed closed most of the nation’s bituminousmines. When some state militias marched in to reopen the mines, there weremurderous clashes. Public backlash doomed the strikers. While those coal minersreturned sullenly to the pits for lower wages, trouble flared in Chicago. Thegreat Pullman Palace Car Company, which manufactured every railroad’s sleepingcars, fired half its workforce and cut wages by a fourth. But the company didnot reduce rents comparably on its overpriced company housing, where alloperatives were required to live. When three unionized workers protested, GeorgePullman fired them, laid off all his workers, and closed the entire plant. Fortwo months Pullman rejected any arbitration. At the end of June, his employeesunion, the American Railway Union, vowed its members would not serve on anytrain with a Pullman Palace Car until the company accepted arbitration. With somuch anger and misery festering, the strike spread like wildfire, and within acouple of weeks the heartland’s rail system shuddered to a halt. Factories wentdark for want of coal. A badly ailing economy was dealt a debilitating blow.President Grover Cleveland, who abhorred anything that smacked of “socialism,”had resisted fashioning any federal solutions to nationwide want and misery. Buthe did not hesitate to call out the militia to break the strike. On July 5, asthe soldiers marched in, Chicago, just a year earlier the proud host of theWorld’s Fair, was engulfed in deadly riots and rampant looting. The violencespread elsewhere. With that, even the most liberal sympathy for the strikersevaporated. The Sherman Anti-Trust Act was invoked to jail union leader EugeneDebs and others, and gradually calm returned. But not prosperity. Many Americanshad come to view the nation as in a struggle for its very being, pitting thegreedy rich against the ordinary folk. The North American Review decried the new“plutocracy … their octopus grip is extending over every branch of industry; aplutocracy which controls the price of bread we eat, the price of sugar … theprice of the oil that lights our way, the price of the very coffins in which weare finally buried.”15 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts15a] It hadbeen a very grim year.Despite the nation’s labor strife and abysmal economic state, Edward Dean Adamshad forged resolutely ahead with the complex Niagara Power infrastructure,readying the site for the day the electricity finally began to flow, a date thatwas being pushed back continually. Cataract’s new far-flung industrial domain atthis stage included not just the unfinished powerhouse and the smallertransformer building, but a dock for Great Lakes ships to unload and a hugeswath of rough reclaimed land created with tunnel debris. All of this was thenconnected by the company’s railroad, seven miles long. Then there was Cataract’sworkers’ village, Echoata, with sixty-seven modest two-family houses with trimlawns designed by renowned New York architect Stanford White of McKim, Mead &White. Adams had pressed White to find time in his overloaded schedule to serveas the architect for Power House No. 1, the gigantic but simple “cathedral ofpower” constructed with chiseled Queenston quarry limestone, as well as forEchoata. The powerhouse was two hundred feet long, sixty-four feet wide, andforty feet high, topped by a slate-and-iron roof, a building whose plainexterior gratified the Brahmin sensibilities of Edward Dean Adams. Tall,graceful windows kept the powerhouse interior aglow with lambent natural light.Deep in the basement, the three powerful turbines sat unmoving, awaitingWestinghouse’s dynamos and Niagara’s roaring green waters. As at the World’sFair, the switchboard was a huge marble affair set up on a railed platform.George Westinghouse’s hard-fought triumph at Niagara and the industrial spyingcharges had done nothing but aggravate his already acrimonious relations withGE. And many, including historian Harold Passer, have wondered why the powerfulMorgan forces behind GE had not exerted their considerable influence at Cataractto win GE the coveted dynamo contract. (Early on, Edward Dean Adams hadhonorably divested himself of all Edison GE stock to remove his own possibleconflicts.) Passer concluded that the stakes were just too high, “the financierswere afraid to go against the judgment of their engineering advisers.”16[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts16a] GE did win a contract fortransformers and transmission. Yet so parlous was GE’s situation as thepost-panic depression settled in that its Wall Street backers decided to takeanother tack, eyeing a takeover of the unwilling Westinghouse. This would put GEfirmly in control, not just of Niagara, but of 90 percent of the electricalmarket, thus creating J. P. Morgan’s favorite industrial arrangement, near ortotal monopoly. But there was also the paramount issue of who owned theall-important Tesla AC patents. Already that issue had made it impossible for GEto win the Niagara dynamo contract. Westinghouse and GE were reportedly lockedin three hundred patent lawsuits, many over AC designs, and a “merger” wouldsave each $1 million a year in legal fees. So the markets and rumors began tobubble and boil.“General Electric was most anxious to bolster its jerry-built structure with thesolid Westinghouse concern,” wrote Thomas Lawson in his muckraking Gilded Ageclassic, Frenzied Finance, which examined how Wall Street’s robber barons madeeasy and unscrupulous millions through watered stock, market manipulation, andmonopolies. “Suddenly the financial sky became overcast. The stock market grewpanicky … Wall and State streets [were] full of talk about General Electric’sprobable absorption of Westinghouse…. This was the signal. From all thestock-market sub-cellars and rat-holes of State, Broad, and Wall streets creptthose wriggling, slimy snakes of bastard rumors which, seemingly fatherless andmotherless, have in reality multi-parents who beget them with a deviltry ofintention…. [Rumors] … seeped through the financial haunts of Boston,Philadelphia, and New York, and kept hot the wires into every financial centrein America and Europe, where aid might be sought to relieve the crisis. Therecame a crash in Westinghouse stocks and their value melted.”17[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts17a] In this era long before any suchregulating body as the Securities and Exchange Commission, Westinghouse foughtback with the weapons of the time. He hired Lawson, a specialist in stock marketmanipulation, and Lawson masterminded a retaliatory attack on GE stock, anattack so ruinous that the Morgan forces retreated. The Westinghouse stockrecovered, and George Westinghouse got on with his Niagara power contract.Eventually, a wiser Westinghouse reached an 1896 patent-sharing agreement withGE that allowed the firm use of the all-important Tesla patents, ending such GEtakeover attempts.As George Westinghouse moved the mammoth Niagara Falls Power Company projectsteadily to completion, Nikola Tesla’s aura of fame glowed more brightly. ThomasCommerford Martin, the ever ambitious editor of Electrical Engineer, had beenfaithfully promoting his friend’s work and career since Tesla’s reluctant butmomentous first lecture at Columbia College in mid-1888 on the AC inductionmotor. In late 1893, Martin and Tesla published a thick book titled TheInventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla, which included all theinventor’s major lectures, as well as a brief profile by Martin and many ofTesla’s early patent applications. Martin, a distinctive figure in Manhattansocial circles with his handsome bald head, soulful eyes, bristling mustache,and energetic ways, had decided the time was ripe to introduce Tesla beyond theconfines of the world of electrical science. So Commerford, as his friendscalled him, had set off in the December cold to the Union Square offices of thegenteel and middlebrow Century magazine, there to persuade associate editorRobert Underwood Johnson, amid his towering stacks of manuscripts and books,that Nikola Tesla was the next wizard, a figure comparable to Edison. Commerfordproposed to write a profile of this fascinating Serb. Johnson, a handsome manwith a close-cropped black beard and gold-rimmed glasses, was sufficientlyintrigued to tell him to bring Tesla to a dinner party at his Lexington Avenuebrownstone, where the editor and his vivacious wife, Katherine, cultivated awide range of famous and lively luminaries, writers like Mark Twain, the shaggynaturalist John Muir, musician Ignace Paderewski, and popular actors andactresses playing the New York stage. Just before Christmas, Tesla dutifullyaccompanied Commerford to dine, the tall, slender inventor wearing one of hiselegant tailored evening suits. Tesla appeared haggard and wan, but he proved tobe a riveting conversationalist.Both Johnsons were completely enchanted by the charismatic and courtly Tesla.Robert Johnson had met a great many famous and accomplished men and women andwas more than familiar with all the usual egotism combined with notablelimitations of real learning and intellect. In Tesla, Johnson believed he hadfound that rare man, one steeped in the most abstract electrical science, butalso “widely read in the best literature of Italy, Germany and France as well asmuch of the Slavic countries to say nothing of Greek and Latin. He isparticularly fond of poetry and is always quoting Leopardi … or Goethe or theHungarians or Russians. I know of few men of such diversity of general cultureor such accuracy of knowledge.” Yet this electrical and cultural prodigy wasalso a lovely human being. Johnson described his new friend’s personality as“one of distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity andforce.”18 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts18a] So that evening begana long and warm friendship. Commerford, of course, secured his magazineassignment. The Johnsons insisted that the exhausted-looking inventor return afew days hence for a rejuvenating Christmas dinner, a jovial celebration withtheir two teenage children and others.Christmas Day in Manhattan dawned wonderfully balmy and springlike, a greatblessing for the poor in their cold tenements. The widespread economic miserybrought on by the summer’s panic had reduced so many to destitution and so manyothers to outright beggary that The New York Times described a muted holidaylargely dedicated to alleviating want. Every church gathered clothing and foodfor the needy, while many served large, filling meals and provided smallpresents for the ragged, unwashed children of the new poor. A thousandnewsboys—abandoned urchins ever present on the city’s streets eking out a livingselling papers—gobbled down their annual Noel feast of turkey, ham, andmincemeat pie served at the Newsboys’ Lodging House on Duane Street. At theGerlach Hotel, where such want was out of sight, Tesla donned his elegantclothes and strolled forth, joining the fashionable Christmas crowds throngingBroadway, window-shopping the stores bedecked with winter greens. The wholecity, rich and poor, was out enjoying the April-like respite from winter. Manywere streaming up to Central Park, but Nikola Tesla was going east to LexingtonAvenue.Tesla so enjoyed the Johnsons’ gaiety and intelligence that day, and it was sucha strangely warm evening, that he invited them after dinner to venture downtownto see his laboratory, the first of many such nocturnal visits. Long after,Robert Johnson recalled those extraordinary forays down to South Fifth Avenueand the tromp up the stairs to Tesla’s laboratory loft. These outings eventuallyincluded other favored guests like Twain and architect Stanford White, whosePower House No. 1 at Niagara was to shelter all three of Tesla’sthirteen-foot-tall AC dynamos. Wrote Johnson of those lab visits,“Lightning-like flashes of the length of fifteen feet were an every-dayoccurrence, and his tubes of electric light were used to make photographs offriends as souvenir of their visits. He was the first to make use ofphosphorescent light for photographic purposes—not a small item of invention initself.”19 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts19a]Through the Johnsons and then White, Tesla became something of a societydarling, a sought-after guest swirling through Manhattan’s most glitteringhomes, private salons, and lavish restaurants. Tesla reciprocated by hostingelaborate dinner parties in private rooms at the delectable Delmonico’s. AtStanford White’s urging, Tesla and Robert Johnson joined the arty Player’s Clubacross from Gramercy Park. Tesla still worked prodigious hours and frequentlydeclined the invitations that showered down. But when he allowed White to cajolehim into going sailing late one November, the architect wrote gleefully, “I amso delighted that you have decided to tear yourself away from your laboratory. Iwould sooner have you on board than the Emperor of Germany or the Queen ofEngland.”20 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts20a] It was something ofan odd pairing, for Tesla, with his priestly devotion to electricity and hisphobias for germs, showed no interest in women or sex, while White was a sexualsatyr whose lubricious pursuit of delicious young females eventually led to hisshooting death by an outraged husband.In February of 1894, Commerford’s Century profile of Tesla ran, complete with amoody engraving from a handsome Sarony photograph. The article was Commerford athis most florid, gushing that “Mr. Tesla has been held a visionary, deceived bythe flash of casual shooting stars; but the growing conviction of hisprofessional brethren is that because he saw farther he saw first the low lightsflickering on tangible new continents of science.”21[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts21a] This admiring (if overwrought)article in a major national magazine naturally caused quite a stir, promptingthe New York press to become interested. A few months later on Sunday, July 22,Joseph Pulitzer’s New York World, Manhattan’s biggest daily, ran a long andprominent profile. Written by popular columnist Arthur Brisbane, the headlineand subheads ran OUR FOREMOST ELECTRICIAN, “Greater Even Than Edison,” “TheElectricity of the Future,” and so forth. Brisbane, unlike Commerford, did notunderstand anything about electricity, nor did he pretend to. “Every scientistknows his work,” wrote Brisbane of Tesla, “and every foolish person included inthe category of New York society knows his face. He dines at Delmonico’s everyday. He sits each night at a table near the window … with his head buried in anevening paper.”Brisbane’s article was illustrated with a full-length drawing of Nikola Teslaresplendent in formal cutaway coat and striped dress pants and radiating “theEffulgent Glory of Myriad Tongues of Electric Flame After He has SaturatedHimself with Electricity.” This was, of course, Tesla’s most famous lecturestunt, running many thousands of volts through himself until electrical flameslicked all about his person. He confessed to Brisbane, “My idea of letting thiscurrent go through me was to demonstrate conclusively the folly of popularimpressions concerning the alternating current. The experiment has no value forscientific men. A great deal of nonsense is talked and believed about ‘volts’AC…. You see voltage has nothing to do with the size and power of the current.”Brisbane, like most who met Tesla, found him mesmerizing, and the two sat up allthat hot, still night at Delmonico’s talking, leaving only when the dawn brokeand the scrub ladies appeared with their mops and pails to swab the restaurant’smarble floor. Brisbane told the New York World’s 280,000 Sunday readers: “WhenMr. Tesla talks about the electrical problems upon which he is really working hebecomes a most fascinating person. Not a single word that he says can beunderstood. He divides time up into billionths of seconds and supplies powerenough from nothing apparently to do all the work in the United States. Hebelieves that electricity will solve the labor problem. That is something forMr. [Eugene] Debs to ponder while he languishes in his dungeon. It is certain,according to Mr. Tesla’s theories, that the hard work of the future will be thepressing of electric buttons.”That fall, The New York Times weighed in on Sunday, September 30, 1894, withmultiple columns on NIKOLA TESLA AND HIS WORK, with the subhead “Advancing withCertainty to Greatest Triumphs.” In contrast with Brisbane’s lighthearted romp,The New York Times made an exhaustive attempt to explain Tesla’s work in highfrequency and the science behind his wireless lights. Oddly, Niagara was noteven mentioned. The truth was that even as work on the Westinghouse dynamos wasadvancing steadily, Tesla was passionately and utterly absorbed with a new andmore abstruse electrical frontier. Daily he labored away in his laboratory,oblivious to the commercial cacophony wafting up from the busy street below.Nikola Tesla was deep into a completely new electrical dream, one that he hadconfessed to New York World reporter Arthur Brisbane in their long evening atDelmonico’s: “I look forward with absolute confidence to sending messagesthrough the earth without any wires. I also have great hopes of transmittingelectric force in the same way without waste.”22[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts22a]Wireless transmission of power. While Tesla would speak openly of his work in ageneral way, he was highly secretive about the specifics of his research intowhat we know today as radio. By mid-1894, Tesla had built a small portable radiotransmitting station, and all that year he continually tested and improved it.Many an afternoon and evening he climbed the stairs with one of his draftsmen tothe broad roof above his laboratory and set up the transmitter. Then he wouldtake his receiver and head out to high-up places progressively farther away,testing to see how far his wireless radio signals could travel. By winter Teslawas setting up on top of where he himself lived, the Gerlach Hotel (a “StrictlyFireproof Family Hotel”), thirty blocks uptown, a mile and a half north of hislaboratory. Up on the Gerlach roof, ten stories above the stylish and exclusiveshops of Broadway, Tesla would carefully send up a tethered balloon filledeither with helium, hot air, or hydrogen. The balloon and its string wereholding aloft, as high as was practical, an aerial. A cable was attached to thehotel’s water main. Tesla would then tune in his receiver to successfullyreceive his draftsman’s broadcast signals from the lab roof downtown. All thatwinter, Tesla fine-tuned his primitive radio, knowing that as soon as the HudsonRiver was clear of ice in the spring, he would take a river steamer north andsee just how far he could sail toward Albany and still receive transmissions. Soas the year ended, Tesla was in fine fettle, with every reason to feeltriumphant.Certainly the year 1895 promised yet more glory for Nikola Tesla, for even as heperfected his new radio, he could anticipate the turning on of the electricpower at Niagara Falls. At long last, seven years after the unknown electricianhad first sold his patents to George Westinghouse, four years after he gave uphis royalties to help save the company, Tesla’s Westinghouse AC dynamos would beinstalled in Stanford White’s cathedral of power. The great moment was on thehorizon, when the inlet gates to the Cataract canal would open and Niagara’sglass-green waters would flood through. Funneled into the three giant penstocks,the cold river water would fall with a tumbling roar toward the water turbines.As those great sunken wheels revolved in a frothing, whirling blur, each steelshaft, too, would whirl. Up in the glowing riverine light of the powerhouse,atop the gleaming, whirling steel shafts, Tesla’s trio of great dark dynamoswould also whirl, creating magnetic fields of power. And from those hummingdynamos would flow an invisible river of electricity, quietly crossing thebridge to the transformers, there to become high voltage and mighty, flashingout into the world, where individual transformers would again lower itsinvisible and silent flow to light tens of thousands of bulbs, to power greatindustries, to run the Buffalo streetcars, to brighten man’s nights and lightenhis load. They had called him a dreamer, but this was no dream.And so great glory would rightly be Tesla’s. Others in time surely would havesolved the problem, for the conundrum of the AC motor and the polyphasegenerator had been very much in the air. But he, Nikola Tesla, had been therefirst. His place in history was secure. Yet it was not just glory Tesla sought,but the financial means to work as he would. He fervently believed AC was justthe beginning, an interim stage in a far more sophisticated yet simpler systemof power he was already working on: wireless transmission. And no one less thanEdward Dean Adams, a much admired judge of men, money, and prospects, wished tobe his financier. Adams had, it turned out, been quietly courting Nikola Teslafor some time. Adams, that wise old frog, understood far more than almost anyother Wall Street money man the enormous value of Tesla’s AC patents. And Teslawas quite forthright in asserting that these were just the first of hisrevolutionary inventions to be developed and commercialized. In mid-February1895, a one-paragraph story in Electrical Engineer announced the formation ofthe Nikola Tesla Company, which would “manufacture and sell machinery,generators, motors, electrical apparatus, etc.”23[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts23a] The company had a gilt-edgedgroup of directors—Edward Dean Adams and his son Ernest, the hardworking andambitious William Rankine, Tesla’s long-ago rescuer Alfred S. Brown, one CharlesCoaney of New Jersey, and Tesla. The story spoke of $5,000 in capital, but thisseems a laughable sum, and Tesla later said Adams alone invested $100,000. So asthe spring of 1895 neared, Nikola Tesla was an inventor to be much envied.Then calamity struck. At 2:30 in the morning on March 13, 1895, Nikola Tesla’slaboratory burned to the ground in a fire so intense, the whole loft buildingimploded and his whole floor collapsed into the inferno, obliterating everysingle piece of his electrical apparatus. When the cold gray dawn shed itslight, all that was to be seen at 33-35 South Fifth Avenue, reported the NewYork Sun, were “two tottering brick walls and the yawning jaws of a sombercavity aswim with black water and oil.” Charles Dana, one of the most reverednewspaper editors of his time, wrote, “The destruction of Nikola Tesla’sworkshop with its wonderful contents, is something more than a private calamity.It is a misfortune to the whole world. It is not in any degree an exaggerationto say that the men living at this time who are more important to the human racethan this young gentleman can be counted on the fingers of one hand; perhaps onthe thumb of one hand.”24 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts24a]Fortunately, Tesla had not been toiling away late that night or he might havebeen trapped in the conflagration and incinerated.Instead, he strolled down for work at 10:00 A.M. as usual, only to be greeted bythe horrifying sight. “It cannot be true,” he repeated again and again as hepaced up and down before the charred, smoking ruin. His fifteen employees, whohad arrived quite a bit earlier, stood there disconsolate. They had not had theheart to summon him from the Gerlach Hotel to such a tragedy. When The New YorkTimes reporter approached him, Tesla waved him away, saying, “I am in too muchgrief to talk. What can I say? The work of half my lifetime, very nearly; all mymechanical instruments and scientific apparatus, that it has taken years toperfect, swept away in a fire that lasted only an hour or two. How can Iestimate the loss in mere dollars and cents? Everything is gone. I must beginover again.”25 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts25a] Tears filled hiseyes. All his specially designed dynamos, oscillators, motors, and vacuum bulbs,not to mention all his records and papers and correspondence, his World’s Fairexhibit, all his newly developed radio transmitters and receivers, the manyyears of work and thought, all gone up in raging flames.While one might readily suspect the fire had arisen in his laboratory with allits electrical wonders, the nightwatchman reported it had begun on the groundfloor. Another tenant, a steam-fitting manufacturer, had over time saturated theloft building with oil, and “it burned like a tinder-box.” The watchman’sbuckets of water were futile. All the firemen could do, though they battled thefire for three hours, was prevent its spread to an adjacent box factory and thenearby elevated railroad. In a heartsick daze, Tesla slipped away and wanderedthe city streets. Robert and Katherine Johnson looked for him everywhere,wanting to help him at this moment of “irreparable loss.” Some of his apparatusexisted in similar form elsewhere—his dynamos and oscillators and motors—but hisradio work was unique and would all have to be completely rebuilt. Nothing inhis laboratory was insured. The financial loss was complete and devastating.Tesla had made huge sums in recent years, but he had poured almost all of itinto the now smoldering ruin.There was, of course, nothing to do but start again. Encouraged by Commerford,the Johnsons, and his many Manhattan friends and acquaintances, Tesla regatheredhis broken spirits and secured a new laboratory at 46 East Houston Street. Laterhe would tell a reporter, “I was so blue and discouraged in those days that Idon’t believe I could have borne up but for regular electric treatment which Iadministered to myself. You see, electricity puts into the tired body just whatit most needs—life force, nerve force. It’s a great doctor, I can tell you,perhaps the greatest of all doctors.”26[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts26a] By March 22, Tesla wassufficiently recovered to write one of the top Westinghouse managers with ordersfor new equipment. “You have, no doubt,” Tesla wrote, “learned through thepapers of the unfortunate accident which has deprived me of all my apparatus,and of some results of my recent work. I must now rebuild my laboratory.” Withinthe month, needed machines began to arrive. Tesla also wrote Westinghouseengineer Charles Scott, who had supervised AC at the Telluride Gold King Mine,asking him to help push through his many orders. “This kind of work is almostessential to my health,” he explained.27[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts27a] In the interim, Tesla foundrefuge in the most unlikely of places—Thomas Edison’s gigantic laboratory inWest Orange, where once Harold Brown had electrocuted dogs, calves, and horses.The press had taken to portraying Edison and Tesla as rivals for the title ofAmerica’s greatest wizard, but in such a time of loss, Edison could set asidehis competitive instincts to offer temporary working shelter to the grievingTesla.When first Edward Dean Adams considered the financial prospects of a hydropowerplant at Niagara Falls, he (and all others) had assumed that transmission tothriving big-city Buffalo was the key to success. Now, as the first of theeighty-five-ton dynamos was fitted into place around the thick steel shaft ofthe giant turbine, the Cataract officers discovered that entire new industrieswere prepared to move to the firm’s industrial acres and contract for largeamounts of cheap Niagara power. The first industrialist was Chester Martin Hall,who had announced in 1893 that he would be moving his Pittsburgh ReductionCompany to the falls. Until the enterprising and energetic Hall, aluminum was ahighly sought after strong, light metal whose high price—$15 a pound—prohibitedits widespread use. While Hall was a student at Oberlin College in 1880, hisprofessor had told his class that whoever could cheaply manufacture thewonderfully useful metal would make a fortune. Hall had whispered to aclassmate, “I’m going for that metal.”28[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts28a] And he’d kept at it doggedlyfrom that time until 1884. Back in his woodshed laboratory, Hall finally, aftermuch trial and error, discovered that double fluorides would extract aluminumfrom the clay where it was most abundant. When he energized that with electriccurrent, he ended up with pure aluminum. Soon, Hall’s Pittsburgh company (laterrenamed Alcoa) had the price down to less than a dollar a pound. But to cutcosts further, he needed plenty of cheap electricity. At Niagara he hoped to getit.Hall’s daring commitment to cheap power that did not yet exist was matched bythat of Edward Goodrich Acheson, a chemical genius who had acquired hiselectrical training with Edison in Menlo Park and then Europe. He was asufficiently talented inventor that George Westinghouse had bought some of hispatents. Acheson decided that what the emerging industrial world needed was acheap abrasive, something to replace the $1,000 plus it cost for a pound ofdiamond dust. Eventually he devised an electrochemical process that created whathe called Carborundum, a substance hard enough to cut glass. At his factory inMonongahela, just outside Pittsburgh, he was already selling twenty pounds a dayat $576 a pound, but he could have sold twice that, were the price not soprohibitive. Like Hall, Acheson needed massive amounts of cheap electricity. Inhis case, electricity would fire new arc furnaces capable of reaching unheard-oftemperatures. He, too, sought electricity at Niagara. When Acheson informed hisboard that he had signed a contract for 1,000 horsepower a day (with an optionfor 10,000 more) from the Niagara Falls Power Company, which had yet to transmitso much as a single horsepower, they resigned en masse. Hall with his aluminumand Acheson with Carborundum would soon be followed by many other entrepreneursstarting or expanding electrochemical or electrometallurgical firms producing“acetylene, alkalis, sodium, bleaches, caustic soda, chlorine.”29[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts29a] So it was that Edward Dean Adamsand William Rankine discovered, as their fixed costs mounted and the dynamoswere not yet running, they could probably sell all their first 15,000 horsepowerof electricity locally.Finally, on August 26, 1895, almost a year later than predicted by theengineering journals, Niagara power was harnessed for full-time commercial use.For nine months, the engineers had been testing and calibrating and retestingall aspects of the system, especially the behemoth Westinghouse dynamos. Leadengineer B. J. Lamme described what happened during one early test in Pittsburghof a giant dynamo when numerous little temporary steel bolts had “loosened upunder vibration, and finally shook into contact with each other, thus forming ashort circuit…. In a moment there was one tremendous [electric] arc around theend of the windings of the entire machine…. It looked, at first glance, asthough the whole infernal regions had broken loose. Everybody jumped for cover.”One man managed to shut down the machine, and gradually the huge flamingelectrical arc that had engulfed the dynamo subsided. Peering forth from theirshelters, the engineers then rushed back and “someone climbed underneath to seewhat had become of our man inside … expecting him to be badly scorched…. He saidthe fire came in all around him but did not touch him.”30[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts30a] No one present had ever seensuch a sight.But now, at long last, the first Niagara dynamo was ready. At 7:30 A.M. thatlate-summer morning, the inlet gates at the canal opened, the river waterflooded into one of the penstocks, the turbine whirled, and so did Dynamo No. 2,flashing alternating current off to the Pittsburgh Reduction Plant. The specificelectrical needs of this voracious first customer made for delicious irony. For,as The New York Times noted in its small story buried back on the ninth page,“The power from the power house is sent over copper cables laid in a conduit tothe aluminum works. The current sent is an alternating one, and before it can beused in the making of aluminum it must be transformed to a direct current. Thisis done by passing through four of the largest rotary transformers ever built.These are 2,100 horse-power each, and three of them are running. Everything wasfound to work perfectly and great satisfaction was expressed by the officers.”31[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts31a] The Niagara Falls Power Companyhad spent several arduous and expensive years determining the best means ofsending large amounts of power the long distance to Buffalo. Adams and Sellershad audaciously chosen AC, and now they had all the customers they needed withineasy reach of DC and the power they needed was DC!The city of Buffalo, the original intended market, the booming metropolis thathad proudly declared itself the City of Light, had been bogged down month aftermonth about what sort of franchise they should grant. Its Common Council andthen its Board of Public Works wrangled on and on about how to proceed. Shouldthe city itself manage the electrical power? William Rankine, a man whose brutalschedule for six wearing years had brought on a serious case of heart disease,handled the negotiations. Rankine, Niagara Falls Power Company secretary, hadfirst approached the Buffalo city fathers in October of 1894 to secure thenecessary franchise, explaining that his company would like a commitment for10,000 horsepower before Niagara began excavating new wheel pits, ordering moredynamos, and installing transmission lines twenty-six miles across the farms andforests. A full year later, Buffalo’s Common Council and Board of Public Workswere still dithering and the Niagara Falls Power Company had no franchise. Theywere separated by such serious issues as the city’s wish to have the right torevoke the franchise on ten days’ notice or the right to order all wiresunderground at any time.But at Niagara Falls, Power House No. 1 was at last up and running, and it hadbeen successfully flashing electricity to the Pittsburgh Reduction Plant formore than a month. Now both Westinghouse dynamos were humming quietly away,which meant the Niagara Falls Power Company was finally earning income. EdwardDean Adams, president of the Cataract Construction Company, felt the timepropitious for a full-scale, formal tour of the $4 million investment, a smalland private celebratory savoring of their mighty work. So on September 30, 1895,Adams assembled his board of directors at Power House No. 1. All the men (withthe exception of William Rankine) were well-known Manhattan millionaires, longadmired for their financial prowess but increasingly resented during hard timesas plutocrats running Wall Street and government as their own private club.When the Cataract directors stood for their photograph inside the luminouspowerhouse, all wore the standard uniform of Gilded Age gentlemen: somber vestedsuit, dark overcoat, respectable black bowler, and black umbrella in hand,powerful men dwarfed by the gargantuan dark dynamos brooding behind them. Thetall, slender John Jacob Astor, not yet thirty, was a scion of the gigantic NewYork real estate fortune. An inventor with numerous patents, he interestedhimself in all manner of odd schemes and adventures. Darius Ogden Mills had madehis first money in the craziest days of the California gold rush before settlingin New York, where he became a famously shrewd investor. His purchase of Edisonstock convinced J. P. Morgan to invest more also. His nine-story Mills Buildingon Broad Street was a prestige address for stockbrokers and lawyers and was thefirst office building in the city to have its own generator and electricity. Ithoused, not incidentally, the offices of the Cataract Construction Company.Edward Wickes represented the interests of the Vanderbilts, who, as the majorstockholders in the almighty New York Central, remained one of America’s richestand most socially prominent families. Wickes was also a vice president, withFrancis Lynde Stetson, of Cataract Construction. Charles Lanier was an oldfriend of J. P. Morgan’s whose family’s Wall Street investment firm (where Adamswas a partner) specialized in railroad finance. George S. Bowdoin was ablue-blooded Morgan partner who often joined Morgan on the Corsair, Morgan’sluxurious yacht (with its six staterooms and working fireplaces), where heentertained lovely actresses and desirable widows. John Crosby Brown was awhite-bearded partner of the Wall Street firm Brown Brothers.Last, but by no means least, was Francis Lynde Stetson, who had by now acquiredthe sobriquet of “attorney general” to J. P. Morgan. Earlier that year, inFebruary, he and Morgan had rushed down to the White House in a private railcarto meet with President Cleveland, as the government, hemorrhaging gold from theU.S. Treasury, teetered on the verge of bankruptcy. Stetson found some legalloophole that allowed August Belmont and Morgan to arrange a huge bond sale andthus replenish the U.S. coffers with gold, despite opposition from theRepublican Congress. Republicans, Populists, and newspapers across the landhowled in outrage, especially as the Wall Street bankers proceeded to make aprofit on it all. But with no federal banking system in place, only men likeMorgan had the financial clout to steady the markets. Later, Morgan, who viewedhimself as a staunch patriot, wrote a friend, “The dangers were so greatscarcely anyone dared whisper them.”32[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts32a] So Francis Lynde Stetson’s auraof power shone ever brighter. A millionaire in his own right, Stetson was ahard-nosed legal adviser to many of his own ilk. Rumor had it Morgan paid him a$50,000 annual retainer just to be on call.We have no record of what this mighty assemblage of Cataract directors thoughtof their tour. They had arrived, as was the way with the rich, on privaterailroad cars, no doubt ignoring the ever-present mélange of hard-sellinghackmen scouting late-season fares and touts promoting tourist hotels. Comingout that late September morning to the powerhouse, they would have passed ErieAvenue’s clapboard houses with their wandering chickens. Our eloquent witness tothe wonders of the new Niagara power is, instead, Englishman H. G. Wells,science fiction writer turned social observer:These dynamos and turbines of the Niagara Falls Power Company impressed me farmore profoundly than the Cave of the Winds; are indeed, to my mind, greater andmore beautiful than accidental eddying of air beside a downpour. They are willmade visible, thought translated into easy and commanding things. They areclean, noiseless, starkly powerful. All the clatter and tumult of the early ageof machinery is past and gone here; there is no smoke, no coal grit, no dirt atall. The wheel pit into which one descends has an almost cloistered quiet aboutits softly humming turbines. These are altogether noble masses of machinery,huge black slumbering monsters, great sleeping tops that engineer irresistibleforces in their sleep…. A man goes to and fro quietly in the long, clean hall ofthe dynamos. There is no clangor, no racket…. All these great things are assilent, as wonderfully made, as the heart in a living body, and stouter andstronger than that…. I fell into a daydream of the coming power of men, and howthat power may be used by them.”33[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts33a]One suspects that the New York millionaire Cataract directors, observing thesevery same sights on this, their first formal inspection of their company’selectrical industrial tour de force, were also beset with reveries of what thesefirst monster dynamos augured. Two months later, steelmaker extraordinaireAndrew Carnegie, his reputation for benevolence tattered by Pinkertons unleashedon strikers at his Homestead works, had come to see this latest industrialmarvel. He wrote in the official guest book, “No visitor can have been moredeeply impressed nor more certain of the triumphant success of this sublimeundertaking.”34 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts34a] J. P. Morganmade his pilgrimage that fall also, bringing along his wife, Frances, andseveral other women. As was his wont, he left no comment.The one person who had not yet set foot in Niagara Falls, the man who had neverseen the world-famous cataract, much less Power House No. 1, was Nikola Tesla,the very electrical dreamer whose system of AC (above all his induction motor)had made it all possible. Again and again, the inventor had been invited to makethe journey to Niagara and experience two astounding sights: the thunderingGreat Falls with their towering clouds of mist and rainbows, and the herculeanpower enterprise under construction, with its astonishing subterraneanhorseshoe-shaped tunnel or the gigantic turbines sunken in the bowels ofStanford White’s cathedral of power. But for four years Tesla had turned downall invitations. Not until the summer of 1896 did he finally agree to come.First, he would spend a day in Pittsburgh with George Westinghouse, where theywould visit the firm’s splendid new twenty-acre electrical works out in TurtleValley. That evening, Edward Dean Adams and several others would join them asthey traveled overnight in the comforts of Glen Eyre, Westinghouse’s sumptuousprivate railcar.The next morning, at the height of the tourist season, Nikola Tesla came for thefirst time to Niagara Falls, debarking with the rest of his travel companionsaround 9:00 A.M. on July 19, 1896, at the small but always bustling PennsylvaniaRailroad depot. Also present for this momentous and historic encounter thatlovely Sunday were George Westinghouse, the electrical magnate whose steelydetermination, tremendous courage, and considerable charm had prevailed in theWar of the Electric Currents. Accompanying Tesla and Westinghouse were EdwardDean Adams, who as president of Cataract had advanced resolutely toward the boldchoice of AC; William Rankine, the upstate lawyer whose incessant dedication tothis gigantic venture had wisely shepherded its physical construction;Westinghouse attorney Paul Cravath, who had steered his friend and clientthrough so many legal and financial perils; and Westinghouse’s thirteen-year-oldson, George junior. The group made their way through the holidaymakers, fathersin their straw boaters herding gaggles of excited children and wives in coolwhite lawn dresses with parasols ready against the sun. All the Westinghouseparty boarded a trolley, which trundled them a mile southeast on Erie Avenuetoward the edge of town, the lush green foliage of deep-summer trees spreadingcooling shade along the dusty tracks. Ahead loomed Stanford White’s handsomelimestone Power House No. 1, fronted by a broad lawn. This many-windowedcathedral of power was situated on one side of the broad inlet canal, where thediverted river water sparkled in the sunlight as it flowed steadily into thepowerhouse.Across the canal stood the limestone transformer building, also by White, a muchsmaller, faithful echo of the powerhouse. A limestone bridge spanned the canal,waiting to carry the electrical conduits from the powerhouse to the transformerbuilding. Once the men stepped down from the trolley, the wide Niagara River’spowerful presence was palpable with its rushing, tumbling rapids and coolingbreezes. Here at last it all was, the river, the canal, the cathedral of power,its quiet austerity belying the gigantic achievement. Inside, the luminousmorning light poured in from the ceiling-high windows. It was all so unexpected,so unlike any other industrial venue, so silent, so pristine. Yet the darkmammoth metal dynamos were tall, brooding presences, their vast, ominous powersilently controlled by the switchboard. Only one dynamo was in operation thatquiet Sunday morning, but Tesla and the others inspected it enthusiastically,clambering up and around on the special walkways. And there was all theancillary apparatus on the ground floor to be seen and discussed. Next theydescended in the ornate elevator to the wheel pits, that cloistered space whereone could hear the river water passing through the penstocks and then hear andsee the turbines whirling. When the group came back up, they walked out of thebig powerhouse and crossed over the canal to the transformer building, which asyet had no transformers. The GE machines were still being manufactured. Teslaclosely considered all the complex’s machinery, delightedly asking manyquestions. As the morning waned, Rankine escorted everyone back to his favoritehotel and dining spot, the Cataract Hotel overlooking American Falls. There theylunched.When the Westinghouse-Tesla party emerged from their repast, a crowd ofnewspapermen was lying in wait. After demurring at first, the famous Teslafinally agreed to answer a few questions. “I came to Niagara Falls,” he said,“to inspect the great power plant and because I thought the change would bringme needed rest. I have been for some time in poor health, almost worn out.” Andwhat did he think of the power plant? Tesla’s face lit up. “It is all and morethan I anticipated it would be. It is fully all that was promised. It is one ofthe wonders of the century … a marvel in its completeness and in its superiorityof construction…. In its entirety, in connection with the possibilities of thefuture, the plant and the prospect of future development in electrical science,and the more ordinary uses of electricity, are my ideals. They are what I havelong anticipated and have labored, in an insignificant way, to contribute towardbringing about.” And what of Niagara Falls? the local reporters urgently asked.Tesla replied without hesitation: “The result of this great development ofelectric power will be that the falls and Buffalo will reach out their arms andwill join each other and become one great city. United, they will form thegreatest city in the world.” Was it truly possible, asked another reporter, thatthis was Tesla’s first visit to this world-famous cataract? To the cathedral ofpower? “Yes,” he said, “I came purposely to see it [the plant]. But and it is acurious thing about me. I cannot stay about big machinery a great while. Itaffects me very much. The jar of the machinery curiously affects my spine and Icannot stand the strain.”Of course, the Niagara Falls Power Company’s greatest challenge still remainedunmet, and that was the long-distance transmission of AC power to Buffalo. Thereporters now asked Tesla what he thought of all that. Was it an assuredundertaking? There was good reason to wonder. Just six months earlier, onDecember 16, 1896, after fourteen months of indecision and politicking, the cityof Buffalo had finally come to a franchise agreement with William Rankine thatobliged the Niagara Falls Power Company to deliver to a newly formed Buffaloentity, the Cataract Power and Conduit Company, 10,000 horsepower of electricityon or before June 1, 1897. The first declared customer was the Buffalo StreetRailway Company, which contracted for 1,000 horsepower (DC, of course). TheConduit Company cautiously sought no further contracts until such time as allwent smoothly with this. Tesla’s eyes flashed as he responded to the question oftransmission. “Its success is certain. The transmission of electricity is one ofthe simplest of propositions. It is but the application of pronounced andaccepted rules which are as firmly established as the air itself.”35[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts35a] As he became enthusiastic, hislong, thin hands gestured about his face, trembling noticeably.While Nikola Tesla was the star of the show, the reporters were also interestedto hear the thoughts of George Westinghouse, one of the nation’s greatindustrialists and the man who had taken Nikola Tesla’s brilliant AC inventionsand made them a commercial reality. Westinghouse was feeling quite jovial andlistened to Tesla enthuse “with much interest and good nature.” Did he believethe Niagara Falls Power Company could really sell so much electricity, 100,000horsepower ultimately? Many people said there would never be that much demand.“This talk is ridiculous,” said Westinghouse, his walrus mustache bristling.“When you think that a single ocean steamship like the Campania uses 25,000horse power, it is easy to be seen that there will be no surplus here. All thepower here can and will be used.”36[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts36a] And what would electricity do?The first and greatest benefits would obviously accrue to Niagara Falls, forCataract had 1,500 acres to fill with industries, which were coming. “ButBuffalo’s possibilities are to be made marvelous as well,” he said.First, however, the power had to reach Buffalo. And until such time aselectricity was conveyed successfully from Power House No. 1 to the Queen Cityof Lake Erie, the whole great Niagara power enterprise and effort would not havesurmounted its greatest challenge. After all, Edward Dean Adams, ColemanSellers, William Rankine, Nikola Tesla, George Westinghouse, and his excellentteam of engineers had not been toiling all these years to provide direct currentto local factories. Where was the glory in that? Their electrical dream, whatthey had been striving to show the world, was the revolutionary delivery ofelectricity to entire cities and regions, electricity that was generated cheaplyand abundantly in one locale. From there it would flash forth over far distancesto satisfy every imaginable need—incandescent lighting in offices and homes, arclighting for the avenues, DC for street railways, and motive power for factoriesand mills. And this was just the beginning. Once electricity was cheaply,reliably available, who knew what inventions would draw on its energy? Yes, sothese men had stilled the doubters by showing they could harness largequantities of hydropower using massive turbines and dynamos. But could they sendbig volumes of electricity big distances? And indeed, as William Rankine toldthe reporters that day with Tesla, the Niagara Falls Power Company was even nowarranging the contract for erection of the towering wooden transmission poles,modeled on those of the telegraph companies. But not until early November werethe long-awaited GE transformers finally installed in the transformer house.They were testament to the continuing rapid advance of the electrical arts: Thedynamos’ two-phase AC was to be stepped up to even more efficient three-phase ACfor transmission. By mid-November of 1896, the Niagara Falls Power Company wasfinally ready.All afternoon on the cold Sunday of November 15, William Rankine and severalengineers were at Power House No. 1 testing the delivery of the 1,000 horsepowerto the transformer. However, Rankine had promised his father, an Episcopalminister, that the actual transmission of power would not begin on the Sabbath.So late Sunday night he was back at the powerhouse, lit now not by daylight, butby brilliant hissing arc lights. Inside, the mighty dynamos hummed. Outside, theNiagara River flowed swiftly past and the remaining dead leaves rustled in thealmost bare trees. Rankine and one Westinghouse engineer mounted to theswitchboard platform. Over at the transformer house, a GE engineer had beensupervising and testing all day. They waited for midnight. As soon as Mondaycame, at 12:01, William Rankine pulled down three switches. Twenty-six milesaway in Buffalo, a small group huddled in the southwest corner of the BuffaloRailway Company powerhouse. One man’s eye was on his watch, and when it read12:01, he pulled down three knife-blade switches on their two rotarytransformers. “Perhaps two seconds elapsed,” reported a jubilant BuffaloEnquirer. “Electrical experts say the time was incapable of computation. It wasthe journey of God’s own lightning bound over to the employ of man.”37[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts37a] The Niagara Falls PowerCompany’s alternating current electricity had flashed out at a pressure of 2,200volts, been swiftly stepped up in the GE transformer to 10,700 volts, flashedover the twenty-six miles of cable to the Cataract Power and Conduit Company’stransformer, been stepped down to 440 volts, and flashed on to the BuffaloRailway Company, where rotary transformers—delivered and tested just thatday—brought it up further to 550 volts of DC. The Buffalo streetcars were soonjogging along their rails with Niagara hydropower, mundane yet wondrous proof ofthis miraculous new and invisible reality—long-distance transmission of ACenergy.YOKED TO THE CATARACT! proclaimed that day’s Buffalo Enquirer, with the subheads“Niagara’s Energy Ready to Stir the Wheels of Buffalo’s Great Industries—PowerTransmitted Successfully at Midnight Last Night” and “Now for Prosperity forGreater Buffalo.” In truth, after an hour of transmission the power had beenshut off and all involved had gone off to celebrate. Buffalo was indeed now acity of dazzling prospects. Already it was the world’s sixth largest commercialcenter, storing mountains of Great Plains cereals in its fifty-two grainelevators before they were shipped out to feed the world. Five million head oflivestock passed through each year. Buffalo boasted the world’s largest coaltrestle; twenty-six railroads had seven hundred miles of track and depots; everyday 250 passenger trains alone came and went. Almost six thousand vessels dockedat its port each year.38 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts38a] Andsoon the city would boast the nation’s most abundant, cheapest electricity.Edward Dean Adams had taken Nikola Tesla’s counsel against any formal dedicationwhen the cathedral of power began its mighty work at Niagara Falls. The Buffalomen were of no such reticent nature. Though only a paltry 1,000 horsepower wastheirs as yet, the men running the new Cataract Power and Conduit Company weredetermined to celebrate in grand banquet style. They set a date in mid-Januaryof 1897 and invited Nikola Tesla, who graciously agreed to be the guest ofhonor. So, for the second time in six months, Tesla found himself journeying upto Niagara, traveling overnight in a private railcar from New York City withEdward Dean Adams, Francis Lynde Stetson, Edward Wickes, several othermillionaire directors, and two top Westinghouse engineers, one being LewisStillwell. On Tuesday, January 12, at 9:00 A.M. the group debarked at the NewYork Central depot in Niagara Falls. It was very cold and had been snowinglightly all morning. The town was at its most lovely, its usual ramshackleappearance hidden by the snow and tumbling flakes, the trees shimmering withsnow and icicles. The gentlemen climbed into waiting horse-drawn carriages andmade the short trip to the elegant Prospect House Hotel. There they met WilliamRankine and sat down to a hearty breakfast in the marble octagonal dining room,the gentle winter light diffusing softly through its famous domed ceiling ofstained glass. Once breakfast had been finished, the group declined to speak towaiting reporters, ascended into the carriages, and headed toward Erie Avenueand Power House No. 1. This time, Nikola Tesla would see the transformers atwork as well as several new factories powered by Niagara. In the afternoon, theyvisited the falls.That evening, Tesla and the other men, now in formal evening clothes, allreturned to Buffalo by train to attend the Cataract Power and Conduit Company’slavish electrical banquet at the new Ellicott Square Building. Designed byDaniel H. Burnham, the architect and mastermind of the Chicago World’s Fair,this handsome ten-story neo-Renaissance behemoth with its beautiful, airy,glass-roofed interior was said to be the world’s largest office building, withsix hundred suites. On the top floor was the Ellicott Club, jammed and noisywith hundreds of arriving guests. Each man was handed a souvenir menu andseating list, indicating his table, bound in engraved aluminum covers made withNiagara power. Outside the club’s dark windows, the snow swirled thickly down onthe city below. The din of excited talk rose louder and louder. Nikola Tesla andthe New Yorkers were cloistered in a small office away from the local hoi polloiuntil it was time to be seated.Three hundred of Buffalo’s leading citizens, from the mayor to the majormerchants, were present for this gala occasion, celebrating the long-awaitedarrival into the City of Light of the first 1,000 horsepower of Niagaraelectricity, that mystical, amazing energy. Some fifty eminent scientists and“electricians” had also come north to pay homage, including such important namesas GE’s Charles Coffin and Elihu Thomson, Charles Brush of arc light fame, andT. Commerford Martin of the Electrical Engineer. George Westinghouse, never onefor ceremonies and occasions, had sent in his stead chief engineer LewisStillwell and longtime friend and attorney Charles Terry. Then, of course, therewere the rich and powerful Manhattanites, fifty strong, the capitalists whosedollars had underwritten it all.At 8:00 P.M., the chattering multitudes streamed into the gold-and-white diningroom, scintillating like a starry night with hundreds of electrical fairylights. A giant silver Neptune vase on the long raised speaker’s table displayedcrimson roses beribboned with tricolor electric lights. The company settled inat the eight long banquet tables, each decorated with fresh ropes ofsweet-smelling smilax, its evergreen bright against the starched white linencloths, and set with the finest colored china, crystal goblets, and silver. Theair warmed and conversation rose, and the hothouse scent of the roses,carnations, palms, and ferns subtly scented the room. The waiters skillfullyserved course after course of this festive electrical evening: succulentoysters, lobster, tender terrapin, and rare beef filet, all washed down withsherry, Rhine wine, champagne, the palate refreshed by the sorbet electrique.Pontificated the editors of the Buffalo Morning Express, “Such a company neversat down in Buffalo before, while such an event had never previously beencelebrated in the history of the world.”For three hours, the four hundred guests made merry, the best citizens ofBuffalo relishing this rare convivial rubbing of elbows with important andpowerful New Yorkers whose names “appear almost daily in newspapers around thecountry. They not only control events. They create many and strive for more.” By10:00 P.M., the dessert plates with their delectable petit fours were whiskedaway and the faint blue smoke of hundreds of cigars wisped and curled toward theceiling. Sandy-haired Francis Lynde Stetson, the first of six toastmasters,responded to the toast to “the Company.” He stood up and bluntly launched on aseries of complaints: Since 1889, the New York investors had put up more than $6million to build the great Niagara power plant and the transmission facilities“without thus far receiving one penny of profit or dividends or interest.”Moreover, Stetson lectured his suddenly silent audience, the most profitable wayto use this new power would be to sell all of it to the firms in their ownindustrial park. Nonetheless, Stetson declared curtly, the Niagara Falls PowerCompany intended to honor its less profitable arrangement to supply Buffaloelectricity, but not on time. The 9,000 horsepower of electricity due the cityby June 1897 would not be available until an unspecified future date. Stetson’sungracious toast received stunned, perfunctory ap-plause. Only a man ashard-nosed as Stetson, a man used to wielding great power and having his way,would possess the nerve to coolly announce such churlish news at a banquet. Heearned an editorial rebuke from one local paper the next day.The mayor and the state comptroller gamely delivered their platitudinous toaststhrough the pall of cigar smoke. Then it was time to hear from Nikola Tesla,already a legend. All evening eyes had been upon him, for the inventor was anunusual-looking man, so tall and thin, with his coal black wavy hair, his wideforehead, his luminous eyes, his nervous, uncomfortable manner. As soon as hewas introduced, the packed room of men rose to their feet and began wildlywaving their big linen napkins, cheering for the famous scientist. They wouldshow Stetson who mattered in this world. Smiling shyly, Nikola Tesla stood asthe rapturous roars enveloped the room, shaking the china and crystal. When hetried to speak, the audience began clanging their wineglasses with knives andforks, setting up an even greater clamor of approval. Slowly, the pandemoniumsubsided, and the smiling crowd calmed and took their seats expectantly.Tesla then began his toast in his high-pitched voice, the model of modesty,saying he “scarcely had courage enough to address them.” Then, as the roombecame completely silent, Tesla the idealist urged his listeners to honor the“spirit which makes men in all stages and position work, not as much for anymaterial benefit or compensation, although reason may dictate this also, but forthe sake of success, for the pleasure there is in achieving it and for the goodthey might do thereby to their fellow men.” Finally, here were sentimentsfitting to the epochal nature of the night. The crowd’s wild clapping sent thecigar smoke swirling, and some had trouble hearing Tesla’s words about a “typeof man … inspired with deep love for their study, men whose chief aim andenjoyment is the acquisition and spread of knowledge, men who look far aboveearthly things, whose banner is Excelsior!” Tesla and his audience were enjoyingeach other in this electrical, uplifting moment, as the great creator of Niagarapower elevated the occasion above the bitter, mundane concerns of the money men.At Niagara itself, had not Tesla given up already almost $50,000 in royalties?Unmoved by Tesla’s noble sentiments, the ever practical Stetson looked at hiswatch, stood up, and whispered loudly in his ear, “Mr. Tesla, we will have toleave in three minutes.” The private railcar of the New York millionaires wasattached to a soon-to-depart train. Always good-natured, Tesla endeared himselfwith his final kind words: “Let me wish that in no time distant your city willbe a worthy neighbor of the great cataract which is one of the great wonders innature.” With that, he bowed. The diners rose as one, their cheers echoing backand forth as Tesla departed from the hot, smoky room redolent of good food anddrink, following Stetson, Adams, and the other big New York money men as theymade for the elevators.Those who remained to celebrate into the wee hours, and they were many, feltthrilled. The reporter for the Buffalo Morning Express captured their rapture,declaring, “Great are the powers of electricity…. It makes millionaires. Itpaints devils’ tails in the sky and floats placidly in the waters of the earth….It creeps into every living thing…. Last night it nestled in the sherry. Itlurked in the pale Rhine wine. It hid in the claret and sparkled in thechampagne. It trembled in the sorbet electrique…. Small wonder that the tastewas thrilled and that the man who sipped was electrified, if nothing more.Energy begets energy.”39 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts39a] Allfelt energized themselves as they emerged from the world’s largest officebuilding to a cold gray January dawn and the snow-covered streets. “There wasnot a man who went home [that morning who] did not feel the wheels of commercewhirring in his head and hear the buzz of the mighty dynamos of the electricdinner surging in his ears, beating about him, driving away all other thoughtsand drowning all other contemplation save the glorious knowledge that theintroduction of power had been commemorated.”40[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c12-nts40a]The War of the Electric Currents was over. George Westinghouse, Nikola Tesla,and the alternating current had won.

But in the wake of the War of the Electric Currents, only GeorgeWestinghouse among the Promethean three truly stayed the electrical course. Healone of the three completely mastered the new industrial order of giganticcapital, swift and treacherous change, and colossal corporate enterprise. Everthe audacious innovator and empire builder, George Westinghouse continued tomake prodigious advances in AC technology and capacity, determined to make ACelectricity so cheap, abundant, and versatile that it could power anything,including the heaviest locomotives. He had no doubt that once that was so, thewhole world would embrace electricity. Yet such was the new American industrialorder that George Westinghouse had had to share his great AC prize with his farbigger rival, General Electric, or risk repeated corporate attacks. That greatconcession made, Westinghouse also began setting up foreign affiliates inFrance, Italy, and Russia, the first links in spanning the whole globe with theWestinghouse-generated “ethereal fluid.”Guido Pantaleoni, the cultured young Italian engineer who had worked forWestinghouse in the early AC days, returned occasionally to Pittsburgh. He foundthat while his former boss “would often be highly entertaining … very witty,fond of puns, he really had only one thing definitely and always on his mind,and it would be quite disconcerting … to be interrupted suddenly by questionssuch as: How is that machine doing?” Pantaleoni was struck by how even moreabsorbed Westinghouse now was. “Business matters were gradually coming more andmore to the front…. In business he was a real Giant; I have never met a humanbeing who in that period when he was at his prime could keep track and direct asmany things simultaneously; he had a farsightedness that was almost uncanny tome; every new idea was almost immediately analyzed by him and acted upon beforeyou realized what was in his mind.”1[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts1a] George Westinghouse, havingtriumphed at Niagara with his dynamos, saw his electric works flourish whilethousands of other businesses collapsed or barely survived the grinding years ofthe 1890s depression. He was free to plunge forward in the way he lovedbest—boldly and recklessly, erecting ever bigger works to manufacture ever moregargantuan machines, all in pursuit of cheaper, more efficient power. Hedelighted in his freedom to operate on such a monumental scale.Not long after the Niagara plant began operations, Westinghouse was alreadydeveloping a better version of Englishman Charles Algernon Parsons’srevolutionary steam turbine, a completely new technology for America. Thesemachines, far more powerful than steam engines and far smaller, soon became thestandard means of running generators in electrical plants and factories. WroteWestinghouse biographer Henry Prout, “The obsolescence of the engine-typealternator was almost pitiful. Here was a branch of heavy engineering built upat great cost and backed by years of experience. In the coming of theturbogenerator this experience was mostly thrown away, for the engineering … wasso radically different … designers had to start practically anew … at enormousexpense and through years of effort.”2[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts2a] Other industrialists might haveblanched at such waste, but Westinghouse did not blink an eye. He was always, asProut said, after progress over profits.As Westinghouse traveled restlessly among his many businesses, he continued hislifelong practice of seeking out brilliant inventor/engineers, buying theirpatents, and then collaborating with them to create even better industrialversions. A French physicist, Maurice Leblanc, had invented an air pump thatcould signally improve the efficiency of the new steam turbines. GeneralElectric helped itself to the invention, and Leblanc swiftly sued. GeorgeWestinghouse happened to be in Paris in 1901 and had a friend find Leblanc andbring him to his hotel on the rue de l’Arcade. Westinghouse genially inquired,“So it is you who have sworn to make the fortune of all the lawyers in America.Can we come to terms?” He then proceeded to arrange to buy Leblanc’s patents,which he would share with GE. He also hired Leblanc as a consultant for SociétéAnonyme Westinghouse in France. Leblanc became an enthusiastic collaborator, forhe adored Westinghouse: “He was before all things a perfect gentleman and agreat-hearted man, and he himself a mechanician beyond compare … [as were] hisvigor and power of work.”3 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts3a]Maurice Coster, who ran the French Westinghouse operation, was returning toParis on the train with his boss after a “very hectic day in Havre. We had acompartment to ourselves and I said to him, ‘Mr. Westinghouse, can you go tosleep after such a busy day?’ He replied, ‘Coster, I never think of the past. Igo to sleep thinking only of what I am going to do tomorrow.’”4[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts4a] With this constant forwardthinking, Westinghouse squandered no mental energy on what might have been. Thisforward focus resulted in his receiving a new patent about every six weeksduring his career, or almost four hundred patents. These were not speculativeinventions, but products of proven commercial value. Westinghouse had learnedthe hard way the crucial nature of patents in this new industrial order, andferocious defense of his company’s patents was standard corporate strategy.It was inevitable that Westinghouse would seek to apply the benefits andadvantages of electricity to the era’s most important infrastructure—trains andstreetcars, a form of transportation already so improved by his air brake andautomatic signaling inventions. In 1896, he began collaborating with the BaldwinLocomotive Works to incorporate electricity into moving trains. WhenWestinghouse designed AC systems to power the Manhattan elevated and the NewYork subway system, the dynamos were so gigantic that they had to be assembledin special shops at the East Pittsburgh plant. But that AC power still had to beconverted to DC to run the train engines, a challenge Westinghouse soughtaggressively to solve.Following the pattern of Chicago’s White City and Niagara Falls, in 1905Westinghouse showcased his hugely ambitious new AC locomotive project in themost high-profile, high-wire way. During the first two weeks of May 1905, thetop railway men of forty-eight nations convened, a thousand strong, inWashington, D.C., for the International Railway Congress held every five years.Westinghouse had reluctantly agreed to serve as chairman, for he harbored agreat dislike of public speaking. For two weeks, the delegates strolled aboutthe one hundred pavilions gaily arrayed about the grounds of the WashingtonMonument, there to inspect the multitude of technical exhibits. They assembledfor lectures and speeches, visited the White House, and were feted in grandstyle.On May 16, when the International Railway Congress ended, Westinghouse escortedthree hundred of these railroad men on a special train back to Pittsburgh towitness a practical demonstration of his latest triumph, a powerful locomotiveoperating strictly on AC power. Once in Pittsburgh, the silk-hatted gentlemen ofthe railroad world assembled in the company’s grimy rail yards, gussied up forthe occasion with red, white, and blue bunting. Before them stood twolocomotives, one the familiar powerful steam engine, the other a strange boxyaffair with accordion wires on its flat roof attached to overhead electriclines. The Westinghouse engineers had worked so feverishly to be ready, therehad been as yet no trial run of this strange engine. “This was the firstelectric locomotive of its size, the first alternating-current locomotive, andthe first real main-line electric locomotive.”The demonstration was a rousing success. Westinghouse, in his time-testedhard-charging way, then undertook to bring the New York, New Haven, and HartfordRailroad over to the single-phase system. In June 1907, the work was completeand regular service began. Company historians later saw this project as the“consummation of Westinghouse’s great career, for it combined into one masterfulwork of engineering his revolutionary contributions” in railways and AC.5[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts5a]In the first years of the twentieth century, the Westinghouse Electric &Manufacturing Company was expanding steadily, each passing prosperous yearbringing bigger sales and higher dividends. From 1901 to 1907, sales doubledfrom $16 million to $33 million. By mid-1907, the company stock was yielding avery handsome 10 percent dividend. In his usual fashion, Westinghouse had beenaudaciously wading into the financial markets to underwrite his tremendousexpansions and innovative enterprises, first increasing the amount of stock,then floating collateral trust bonds and debenture bonds. During the spring andsummer of 1907, once again financial weakness and jitters overseas began toinfect the New York Stock Exchange. On August 10, the jitters escalated intooutright terror, and the market began a precipitous downward slide. The nationnervously wondered once again about its banks. “America’s obsolete bankingsystem was like an immense tangle of dry brush and timber waiting for a spark,”Jean Strouse wrote in her biography of J. P. Morgan. “There were in 1907 nearlytwenty-one thousand state and national banks across the country, with nocoordinated management or pool of common reserves. Most of them lent theirsurpluses to correspondent banks in New York, the national money center, and theNew Yorkers lent the money out to the Stock Exchange, individuals, and business.Banks beyond the Hudson could call in the loans at a moment’s notice.”6[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts6a] All September, Americans leerilyeyed the markets and their fragile financial institutions, waiting for more woe.In a case of monumental bad timing, two wealthy American speculators tried tocorner copper in early October, setting off a chain reaction ofbankruptcies—including a mining firm, two brokerages, and a bank. Then wordsurfaced that one speculator was a trustee at Knickerbocker Trust in Manhattan.Depositors, in this era before deposit insurance, sensed a structural wobble andbegan lining up at the trust’s lavish Fifth Avenue offices to extract theirdollars.George Westinghouse was at his company’s New York offices at 165 Broadway inManhattan during these lovely but anxious October days, himself trying to raisemoney. A recent Westinghouse foray into the stock market to raise $7.5 millionfor the electric company had yielded barely $2 million. With the company hummingwith success and prosperity, George Westinghouse had allowed its debt to balloonto $44 million, $30 million of that being in bonds, another $14 million beingnotes due immediately or soon. Now nervous banks were once again calling inloans. On a cool, bright Friday, October 18, Westinghouse telegraphed to WalterUptegraff, his longtime financial secretary, to come quickly to Manhattan.Westinghouse and his faithful aide spent a grim Saturday reviewing the books.The foreign companies, launched as part of Westinghouse’s great electrical dreamof worldwide AC, had been a huge financial drain. The intrepid Pittsburghmagnate needed $4 million in cash right away. Such sums were not, of course, tobe found on Wall Street in its present prostrate state. So they ferried acrossto Jersey City and boarded the Glen Eyre for the rail journey back toPittsburgh. The next day, Westinghouse had the painful task of immediatelylaying off 1,500 men at the air brake and electrical companies, cushioning theblow by saying it was only temporary.Westinghouse’s public relations man, Ernest Heinrichs, noticed as soon as hewalked into the Westinghouse Building that Monday morning of October 21 thatsomething seemed amiss, for there was “an atmosphere of ominous oppressionpervading the offices. Conversations were carried on in whispers. Everybodyseemed to have a feeling of fearful expectancy, as if some dangerous catastrophewas about to descend upon the place. Although nobody appeared to have any ideawhat was going to happen.”By Tuesday there could be no question something big was brewing. “The telephoneleading into Mr. Westinghouse’s office was unusually busy. The ‘boss’ sat in hischair during the entire day, except for an hour when he went to the DuquesneClub to eat his lunch. Besides the busy telephone, many strange visitors madetheir appearance, and one after another was ushered into the big office and thedoor pushed closed behind him.” Westinghouse had spent all day Monday and mostof Tuesday trying to raise his millions in Pittsburgh. And he had been hopefuluntil 2:00 P.M. Then word came that back east in Manhattan, the KnickerbockerTrust had given out its last dollars to its desperate depositors and then closedits ornate doors for good at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. With that, the panicwas unleashed. As Heinrichs prepared to leave for the day, Westinghouse steppedinto his office and said, “You had better stay close to the telephone thisevening. I may have something for you to give to the papers.” Nothing more. Thecompany’s vice president had no greater inkling of what was impending. At 5:30that afternoon, as he and Westinghouse were finishing discussions about someroutine matter, his boss said pleasantly, “I shall have a new job for youtomorrow.”“What’s that?”“Receiver of the Electric Company.” The bankruptcy papers were being prepared asthey spoke.7 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts7a]When Heinrichs returned the next morning to the office, he found a newspaperfriend from the Pittsburgh Chronicle Telegraph waiting for him. The reporterwanted a statement about the stunning news that the Westinghouse Electric &Manufacturing Company, the Westinghouse Machine Company, and the SecurityInvestment Company had all gone belly-up and were in receivership. Heinrichs wasshocked, but he maintained his composure, saying, “Oh, yes, you want a statementfrom Mr. Westinghouse.” When he walked through to his boss’s office, Heinrichsfound Pennsylvania’s U.S. senator George T. Oliver and Pittsburgh political bossChris Magee, both sitting there grim faced. Westinghouse looked as serene asever and pleasantly said he’d soon have a statement. When it came, it emphasizedthe phenomenal prosperity of these companies and depicted the bankruptcy as atemporary and unfortunate expedient until the present “financial stringency” wasresolved.Throughout that sad and unnerving day, Wednesday, October 23, streams of friendsand well-wishers filed in to see Westinghouse in his office. Western Union boysbounded in and out. The chief appeared unperturbed and said buoyantly to oneaide, “By the way, MacFarland, I’ve got an idea now for our turbine that willmake a sensation when we bring it out.”8[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts8a] Westinghouse emerged to join hisoffice staff for lunch. As they ate sandwiches, he munched on an apple. At onepoint, he turned to Heinrichs and urged him when talking to his many newspaperfriends, “Do not forget to make it very emphatic to them that this receivershipis not the end of the company…. [The] company is fundamentally as sound andsolid as ever, and it will emerge out of this unfortunate situation a greaterand more prosperous concern than ever.”9[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts9a] The bankruptcy was a great shockto both insiders and outsiders, but with money so tight, Westinghouse saw noalternative. He treated it matter-of-factly. “‘I grant you this is notpleasant,’ he told one friend. ‘But it isn’t the biggest thing in the world. Alllarge business has its ups and downs. The crisis through which we are passing isonly part of our day’s work.’”10 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts10a]Back in Manhattan, as the Panic of 1907 unfolded, the world turned once again toJ. P. Morgan, now seventy, a powerful man with a plutocrat’s large belly, thelegendary ferocious eyes, and a monstrous nose, red and deformed from acnerosacea. In wake of the Panic of 1893, Morgan’s firm had restructured so manyfailed railroads, he now had a hand in half of America’s rails, the nation’seconomic lifeblood. His combining of U.S. Steel from Carnegie’s firm and othersmaller rivals had created the country’s first billion-dollar corporation in1901. So only J. Pierpont Morgan had the reputation and power to steady thefloundering economy. The great financier returned from an Episcopal gathering inRichmond just as the run on Knickerbocker began. Hunkered down in his sumptuousMadison Avenue library, smoking his huge Cuban cigars, he conferred over thenext few days with the nation’s most powerful bankers and money men, bailing outinterests he felt worthy of the effort, advancing huge hunks of millions asneeded. He and his associates let certain weak banks, trusts, and firms fail.Working with the U.S. secretary of the Treasury, Morgan and his allies duringthe next few weeks staved off complete calamity. One of his partners later said,“In the dark days of 1907, he knew no fear, he believed in the country & himself& imparted pluck & spirit to others & infused strength & hope into men 20, 30,40 years younger than himself. If he had given way, the whole house of financialcards would have fallen.”11 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts11a]Others suspected Morgan had gained some great advantage while others suffereddisaster. Among them was a highly skeptical President Theodore Roosevelt. TR haddeeply angered Wall Street by attacking its entrenched system of power. The daythe Knickerbocker collapsed, Roosevelt emerged from a fifteen-day hunting tripdeep into the Louisiana bayous, where he had bagged and eaten bear, turkey,squirrel, opossum, and wildcat. In a speech the next day, he acknowledged thatmany financiers were blaming his policies for Wall Street’s woes. But he statedfirmly his intention of punishing “successful dishonesty” among wealthymanipulators and swindlers. TR wondered privately in a letter whether “certainmalefactors of great wealth” were not shaking things up to their own nefariouspurposes “so that they may enjoy unmolested the fruits of their ownevil-doing.”12 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts12a]As for George Westinghouse, the eternal optimist who had successfully weatheredprevious financial panics when Westinghouse Electric’s prospects were nowhere sorosy, he assumed the best. Five thousand of his own employees put up $600,000 tohelp in the firm’s reorganization by buying “assenting stock,” far moreexpensive stock that would help retire much of the debt. But when the electriccompany emerged from bankruptcy a little more than a year later in December 1908(under a plan largely of Westinghouse’s own devising), Westinghouse was nolonger the supreme ruler. At long last, the New York and Boston bankinginterests had gained majority control of a company they had long coveted. Theypromptly elected as chairman of the board the dour Robert Mather, a railroadattorney of no major accomplishments, to rein in the Westinghouse exuberancethey found so galling.The very reckless boldness that made the domineering Pittsburgh magnate a greatinventor and entrepreneur was now denounced—his lavish treatment of inventors,his big spending on research, his generosity with his men, and his expensivegambles on new and experimental machines. In short, the usual complaints of themoney men. (Andrew Carnegie, whose steel company was famous for its fabulousprofits and infamous for its poor labor relations, was very much of thatmind-set. He described Westinghouse as “a fine fellow and a great genius, but apoor businessman.”13 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts13a] Thesecriticisms infuriated Westinghouse, who had created one major pioneering companyafter another.) In any case, Westinghouse and the new president, Mather, werelike oil and water, and bitterness festered. One Friday afternoon at the end ofa meeting in Pittsburgh, as Mr. Mather packed up his briefcase, Westinghouse,ever genial, said, “If you are going to New York this evening, I shall be gladto take you in my car. I am going East myself.”There was an uncomfortable silence, punctuated only by Mather’s methodicalgathering of papers and stacking them into his briefcase. He finally said, “Iprefer to go to New York by myself and pay my own fare.”14[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts14a]By late 1910, Robert Mather and the new directors had pushed Westinghouse offthe electric company board entirely. They made various lukewarm overtures tobring the great industrialist back into some kind of active management, but hedisagreed with their whole corporate philosophy. He saw himself as interested inprogress and profits and the welfare of his men, while they were interested onlyin profits. The board, predictably, saw Westinghouse as an utter profligate.Westinghouse also disapproved of the new board’s reneging on their promise topay dividends on the “assenting stock,” shares bought at high prices to get thefirm out of receivership. Westinghouse felt a special responsibility to thesestockholders, who had stepped forward in tough times and seen him through. So asthe electric company flourished and the board refused to pay these dividends,Westinghouse launched one last effort to recapture his stolen company.A short-lived, two-week attempted coup, the Battle of the Proxies, stirred upgreat excitement in the broiling month of July 1911, when a deadly heat waveenveloped East Coast cities. Those who had come to loathe the Wall Street moneymen and their hard-eyed greed were rooting for Westinghouse. From his Pittsburghoffice, he rallied the troops, proclaiming to the nation’s newspapers thatproxies were rolling in by the boxload to unseat the tightfisted board. But whenthe showdown came, the great electrical dreamer could produce but 200,000 votes,compared to management’s avalanche of 490,000 shares. His public relationsofficer, Ernest Heinrichs, watched this poignant last hurrah with sadness. “Theloss of the Electric Company was to Mr. Westinghouse a disappointment from whichhe never recovered. There is no doubt that it broke his spirit.”15[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts15a] The boss who had once proudlyand impatiently informed a subordinate, “Impossible is not in my vocabulary,”had discovered that retrieving his beloved company, the corporate chariot thatwas to spread electricity across the universe, was indeed impossible. It hadfallen irrevocably into hostile hands.The loss of his electric company was a cruel blow, but Westinghouse was at heartan optimist, a doer, and a builder. He still had his four other major Americancompanies and his insatiable desire to improve the world. Although he had alwaysshunned publicity and avoided public speaking, Westinghouse now began to use hisrenown and prestige to lobby frankly in support of the Progressive agenda. OnJanuary 21, 1910, as the after-dinner speaker at a Boston meeting of theAmerican Engineering Societies, he denounced the “evil practices” of the “largeand powerful railway and industrial combinations” and their “selfish and unwisecourse in suppressing competition by methods transparently wrong.”16[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts16a] He urged his fellow engineers tosupport government regulation that would rein in the ruthless and predatorycapitalism that dominated the American business world. Though Westinghouse nevermentioned his own company, it stood as a chilling example of how the Boston andNew York “money power” could use an unregulated stock market and fragile bankingsystem to gain control of someone else’s valuable property.At a time when many Americans had come to view the nation’s industrialists andfinanciers as little better than robber barons and “malefactors of greatwealth,” Westinghouse was a notable exception: an honest industrialist who soldthe best product for the best price, who relished competition and valued hisworkers, and who deserved his hard-earned fortune. His late-life besting by WallStreet was a chastening reminder of the feared and concentrated “money power.”During the 1912 congressional Pujo Committee hearings, the full extent of thatlong whispered, incestuous stranglehold on money and capital was finallyrevealed: The officers of the five biggest New York City banks also held 341 keydirectorships in 112 major U.S. companies. The Morgan partners alone occupiedseats on 72 boards. Westinghouse always viewed such blatant collusion and powergrabbing as wrong.In the two years leading up to his death in 1914, Westinghouse was in obviouslydeclining health, pining, many believed, for the loss of his great life’swork—the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company. In June of 1912, theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers awarded him the Edison Medal for“meritorious achievements in the development of the alternating current system.”He and many others savored the exquisite irony of an Edison honor being bestowedupon Westinghouse, once so maligned by Edison for being the stalwart champion ofalternating current. Numerous other honors rained down upon him from engineeringgroups and foreign governments. Through all his struggles and triumphs, he andhis wife of fifty years remained deeply devoted to each other and their son. AtGeorge Westinghouse’s sixty-sixth birthday party luncheon, held on a gloriousblazing blue October day at their Berkshires mansion, many toasts were drunk.Then Westinghouse himself arose. “A glass of champagne in his hand, [he] smiledacross the table to his wife, and in a voice so tender, so affectionate, so deepin feeling that all were spellbound, said: ‘If I have had any success in life ithas been due to my wife.’”17 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts17a] Allrose and lifted their glasses of champagne to toast this devoted couple’slifetime of ardent marital felicity, and to honor a man who had been sodedicated to improving the world.After the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company’s bankruptcy of 1907,The New York Times wished the best for Westinghouse, calling him “an Americaninstitution in whom we have patriotic pride.”18[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts18a] But Westinghouse never reallyrecovered from his loss. It was as if part of his heart and noble spirit hadbeen excised. On March 12, 1914, George Westinghouse died in Manhattan at theHotel Langham, where he and his wife had stopped en route to their house inWashington, D.C. At his death, fifty thousand people worked for the manycompanies he had created. The companies were valued at $200 million, andWestinghouse himself was worth $50 million. In the heyday of the robber baron,Westinghouse showed that an honest and honorable entrepreneur could triumph,building admired and valuable companies. The Pittsburgh magnate had providedgood and useful work to his legions of employees, as he hoped to do. Probablymore important to him, he had daringly brought the wonders of electricity to theworld. With each passing year, more industries, more towns and villages, morehomes, became electrified. He had, despite his many powerful opponents, achievedhis life goals. Wrote one biographer, “Westinghouse was always working forideals…. High spirit flowed down through the Westinghouse companies and leftenduring love, loyalty, and enthusiasm. A corporation can have a soul.” Moneymeant little to George Westinghouse but the means to lift up the world aroundhim. One day toward the end of his life, he was on a train whose air brakeshelped avert a derailment at a bad track washout. He told an aide, “If some daythey say of me that with my work I have contributed something to the welfare andhappiness of my fellow men, I shall be satisfied.”19[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts19a]THOMAS A. EDISONAfter the formation of General Electric in 1892, Thomas A. Edison was littleinvolved in the development of the electric power field. Some months after thatbitter day when Morgan combined his company, Edison General Electric, withThomson-Houston into GE, Edison’s secretary, Alfred O. Tate, came over from WallStreet to the West Orange laboratory to confer with Edison about a batteryproject. The jolly Tate found his boss alone in the magnificent wood-paneledlibrary. “‘Tate,’ [Edison] said, and I had never heard him speak with suchvehemence, ‘I’ve come to the conclusion that I never did know anything about it[electricity]. I’m going to do something now so different and so much biggerthan anything I’ve ever done before people will forget that my name ever wasconnected with anything electrical.’”20[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts20a]True to his word, Edison plunged himself and his new fortune of $2 million (hispart of the GE merger) wholeheartedly into something “so much bigger”: an ironore separating and concentrating plant on nineteen thousand acres in thebleakest wilds of New Jersey. For some years, Edison, believing (along with manyothers) that America was running out of iron ore, had concluded there was moneyto be made extracting iron from played-out East Coast mines via powerfulmagnets. As early as 1889, he was full of schemes and iron dreams, writing anassociate, “If I could get possession of practically all the magnetic oredeposits in the center of the coal and iron district of Penn[sylvania] I wouldhave a monopoly of one of the most valuable sources of national wealth in theU.S.”21 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts21a] The caveat in all thesegrandiloquent plans was the need for significant capital investments in giantcrushing machines that pulverized the old ore-containing rocks, preparatory toextracting the iron with giant magnets. Experienced mining engineers doubted thefeasibility of such (as-yet-unbuilt) giant machines. As Edison biographerMatthew Josephson said, that “was all Thomas A. Edison needed to hear.”22[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts22a] Edison still loved to be doing“big things,” but his understandable mistrust of Wall Street (and their view ofhim as a poor businessman) would hobble him to some extent, for “big things” inthe industrial world of the 1890s generally required big capital.Edison pressed ahead full bore and designed and built for $750,000 (his andother investors’ money) a large ore-crushing plant in the remote highlands ofOgden, New Jersey, the site of an old iron mine. By April 1891, the monstrousmachine was clanking away, its huge rollers crushing hundred-pound bouldersgouged out from the dynamited hillside by gigantic steam shovels. The powderygrains of extracted ore, removed from the magnets, were then pressed into ironbriquettes. But Edison had a hard time finding steel mill customers at firstbecause the briquettes contained too much phosphorus or too little iron ore.Meanwhile, mechanical problems continually rippled through the noisy, dustyworks, cropping up here or there, and the issue of damp or wet ore was aconstant headache. Mere months after the giant plant roared into production, ithad to be closed for an overhaul. Edison threw himself wholeheartedly into this“much bigger thing,” often spending six days a week there from 1894 to 1897.During those years, he regularly closed and rebuilt the plant or engaged inmajor, expensive tinkerings, all with the ultimate goal of producing threehundred thousand tons of iron briquettes yearly. In 1895, when Edison learnedhis men planned to strike, he shut down the whole unprofitable enterprise forseveral months.Through year after year of setbacks and expensive solutions, Edison was hisusual cheerful self, glorying in the rough life of the mining operation. He worea filthy old duster coat, a broken-down hat, and a dust filter mask, which hecontinually lifted up to spit out his chewing tobacco. Sundays he would clean upand return home to his wife and two small children at the family mansion,Glenmont. Although by 1898 Edison finally had a fully automated plant thatrequired no human labor—to the amazement of the press and his good friend HenryFord—the endless mechanical problems and breakdowns required a staff of almosttwo hundred men to keep the automated wonder up and running. The plant was nowable to crush four- and five-ton rocks, and the capital investment had reached$2 million, most of this being Edison’s money. His early investors, beset by thenation’s worst depression, had long since refused to ante up new funds for whatmany had started to call “Edison’s Folly.”In August of 1897, Edison sold off his stock in the Edison Electric IlluminatingCompany of New York, saying, “I actually needed the money. My Wall Streetfriends think I cannot make another success, and that I am a back number, henceI cannot raise even $1000 from them, but I am going to show them that they arevery much mistaken. I am full of vinegar yet, although I have had to suffer fromthe neglect of an absentminded Providence in this scheme.”23[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts23a] The economics were notpromising. Edison needed to sell his extracted ore at about $6 or $7 a ton tomake a profit, and he anticipated that ore prices—hovering at $4 a ton—wouldrise. But then in 1899, longtime aide Charles Batchelor, who had declined to getdragged into what Edison fondly called his “Ogden Baby,” came out to thedust-covered camp with its gargantuan grinding and clanking machines to showEdison a newspaper story. Of course, the terrible racket didn’t bother Edison,for he was deafer than ever. The article described John D. Rockefeller’s plan tomine the vast high-grade iron deposits of Minnesota’s Mesabi Range.When Edison read the newspaper clipping, which noted iron ore prices had droppedto below $3, he laughed out loud and said, “Well, we might as well blow thewhistle and close up shop.”24 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts24a] Infact, he lingered on another year, losing money fulfilling existing contracts.In typical Edison fashion, he had no regrets: “I never felt better in my lifethan during the five years I worked here. Hard work, nothing to divert mythoughts, clear air, simple food made life very pleasant.”25[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts25a] One suspects crushing rocks outin the sticks with his “boys” was a nice change from the rancorous years of theWar of the Electric Currents and the machinations of Wall Street. And so, givingup on rock crushing, Edison went back to his West Orange laboratory. (When herecycled his disastrous “Ogden Baby” into a cement plant, it made excellentPortland cement, but it still was not very profitable.)Thomas Edison never completely left the West Orange laboratory. During slowperiods at the ore mill, he would return and work feverishly on variousprojects. During those years, his original phonograph was dramatically improved,creating a much needed stream of income as it became good enough to play music.Edison’s Kinetoscope had dazzled visitors to the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago,and the whole field of motion pictures had advanced rapidly, with many strivingto perfect the technology. When on April 23, 1896, Thomas Edison’s Vitascopedebuted at Koster & Bial’s high-toned Music Hall at Herald Square, thesilk-hatted crowd of theatrical promoters and businessmen watched the strangebig screen in amazement as across it swept, in full color, “ballet girls dancingwith umbrellas, burlesque boxers, some vaudeville skits, and finally sorealistic a scene of waves crashing upon a beach and stone pier that some of theviewers in the front row recoiled in fear.”26[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts26a] At the end, the audience burstforth in wild applause, cheering the gray-haired Edison up in his balcony box.He had the good grace not to come down on the stage, for he knew he was not theinventor, but the promoter, of this projector. Nonetheless, Edison, who torehimself away from his New Jersey iron ore operations to attend this Manhattanpremiere, was unwilling ever to acknowledge the important contributions of hislongtime laboratory assistant William K. L. Dickson, or the reality that theVitascope machine showing the “moving pictures” that night was actually patentedby inventor Thomas Armat, who was up in the projection room making it runsmoothly.Edison had set up a primitive movie studio out at West Orange, a swelteringstructure known as the Black Maria, and there, from mid-1893, his movie men hadbeen churning out short, hyperlively silent motion pictures—prizefights, funnyskits, and such. Only in 1904, with the Edison studio’s The Great Train Robbery,did early movies begin to move beyond skits to real stories. This was arevelation, soon copied by others flocking to the business. Generally these“movies” ran about fourteen frenetic minutes, during which time trains werespectacularly wrecked, ladies saved from villains, and all manner of calamitiesand heroics acted out. Audiences could not get enough, and by 1909, there wereeight thousand theaters just for movies, a figure that quickly doubled. Onceagain, Edison, whose laboratory was continually improving the motion picturetechnology, dispatched his legions of well-trained attorneys into long-drawn-outpatent wars, emerging triumphant as the holder of the key motion picture patentsin 1907. Like Westinghouse, Edison understood the supreme importance of owningtechnology.A year later, Edison’s biggest rivals, including the American Mutoscope Company,gathered for a wary December peace lunch in Edison’s West Orange library. Therethey ostensibly celebrated the formation of the Motion Picture Patents Company,essentially a movie trust. It guaranteed fees worth $1 million a year to Edison,who smiled blandly from that day’s group photo. When one former colleagueexpressed concern to Edison about his financial status, he wrote backcheerfully, “My three companies, the Phonograph Works, the National PhonographCompany, and the Edison Manufacturing Company (making motion picture machinesand films), are making a great amount of money, which gives me a large income.”And so, as he turned sixty, Edison was flourishing. While Westinghouse hadbecome a great industrialist building ever bigger, heavier machines, Edison wasalmost unwittingly developing a whole other sector of the American economy, onethat was far less capital-intensive and far more glamorous—the entertainmentindustry.His next big project took him back to a long-standing challenge in the field ofelectricity—developing a better storage battery. As with the light bulb, theever optimistic Edison had thoroughly underestimated the technical difficulties.He began work in earnest in 1900 and introduced the battery in 1903 with hisusual fanfare and hyperbole, asserting: “I am sure one [battery] will lastlonger than four or five automobiles.”27[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts27a] Unfortunately, the battery hadtwo fatal flaws—it began to leak, and it did not recharge as needed. Edisonyanked it from the market and soldiered on. He had poured $1.5 million of hisown into the effort when at last in 1909 he delivered a new kind ofnickel-iron-alkaline battery that proved to have many uses. Initially itsgreatest market was in electric vehicles, and before the gas engine triumphed,half of American delivery trucks used the Edison battery. When that marketdisappeared, Edison hustled up many other industrial uses. The Edison StorageBattery Company slowly recouped the huge investment. As Edison once said, “Ialways invent to obtain money to go on inventing.”Edison reveled in presiding over his numerous companies and remainedunderstandably leery now about ceding any control to outsiders. In 1912, theaging inventor explained to Henry Ford in a letter, “Up to the present time Ihave only increased the [battery] plant with profits made in other things, andthis has a limit. Of course I could go to Wall Street and get more, but myexperience over there is as sad as Chopin’s ‘Funeral March.’ I keep away.”28[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts28a] By having few stockholdersbesides himself, Edison never had to worry that the money men would sell himdown the river again, nor did he have to listen to their carping. But it alsolimited him at times because he did not have big capital. His legendarystubbornness served him well and ill. It certainly helped him push on towardsuccess when anyone else would have despaired and quit. But it also stillprevented him from recognizing important new technologies that he did notinvent. Just as he had refused to see the importance of AC in the 1880s, in the1920s he denigrated commercial radio. Edison hated the idea that the radioaudience was obliged to hear other people’s choices of music and amusement. Butthe (free) delights of radio soon caused phonograph sales to stall anddecline—and Edison would not let his company (now ostensibly run by his sons)design and sell radios until it was too late to compete.As Edison headed into the final decades of a long and highly productive careeras inventor and entrepreneur, he found himself the most admired man in America,a genuine national hero whose huge accomplishments were made all the moreendearing by his folksy persona. The press still loved him, and he rarelydisappointed, regaling reporters with forthright and humorous remarks. Who butEdison, after a huge and devastating fire at his West Orange laboratory in 1914,could say, “Oh shucks, it’s all right. We’ve just got rid of a lot of oldrubbish.”29 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts29a] His birthday becamethe occasion of annual admiring articles. Edison spent more and more timeenjoying the tropical pleasures of his waterfront home, Seminole Lodge, in theFlorida Everglades. There, underwritten by his late-life friends Henry Ford andHarvey Firestone, the aging Edison passed his four final years happily pursuingthe holy grail of finding a wartime source of American rubber for industrialpurposes.The public viewed Edison as the lovable man who had brought them many wonderfulthings that profoundly changed their world—certainly the phonograph was anastonishing addition to daily life, while movies had become a national passion.Honors and medals in profusion were his. Edison was as devoted as any workaholiccould be to his younger second wife. His six children by his two marriages sawlittle of him as they grew up and found him a disappointing father. Some wereestranged. Two sons ran his companies. In the end, the companies, which heowned, were worth about $12 million, a fraction of the value of Westinghouse’sindustrial corporations.To this day, Thomas Edison remains the American inventor with the most patents:1,093. His Menlo Park workshop served as the early prototype of the highlyproductive industrial laboratory. Above all, Edison in the 1920s was seen as thepatron saint of the invisible energy that made life so much easier, so muchbetter for so many—electric light. And though he had long been removed from theelectric power industry, Edison’s name was still attached to many local lightingcompanies and he was happy to bask in that role. When he died in 1931 at ageeighty-four, The New York Times lauded the inventor whose “genius so magicallytransformed the everyday world…. No one in the long roll of those who havebenefitted humanity has done more to make existence easy and comfortable.”30[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts30a]NIKOLA TESLANikola Tesla outlived both his original champion, George Westinghouse, and hisearly rival, Edison. After the triumph of the Niagara Falls Power Company plant,Tesla concentrated his electrical research and experimentation on producingextremely high voltages and frequencies, all with the ultimate aim of wirelesstransmission of energy, for either communication or power. His dreams were big,far beyond the imaginings of his peers, and very expensive. By the end of 1897he was already having money troubles, as he confided in an importuning letter toErnest Heinrichs. The Westinghouse PR man wrote back, “While I am very glad tohear that you are physically and mentally in perfect condition, it grieves mevery much to have you inform me that you are ailing with what you choose to call‘financial anemia.’ … I shall remember your wish about speaking of you to theboys in Pittsburgh and trust that some of them will feel disposed to send you achristmas rememberance [sic].”31 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts31a]Tesla’s idealistic and generous renunciation of his AC royalties was beginningto haunt him. With both Westinghouse and GE now sharing the Tesla patents andbuilding induction motors, this income would have easily supported his mostprofligate laboratory research and still left him the very rich man he deservedto be. His first biographer and longtime friend, John J. O’Neill, estimated thatby 1905, when Tesla’s AC motor patent expired, American induction motors alonewere generating 7 million horsepower. At $2.50 per horsepower, one can quicklycalculate that Tesla had nobly forfeited a princely and heartbreaking $17.5million in royalties.32 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts32a] Whydidn’t George Westinghouse, now that his company was prospering, reward Tesla insome way for this sacrifice? We simply do not know. The investments of men likeEdward Dean Adams, who had bankrolled Tesla to a certain point, were smallchange compared to this lost royalty income.Fortunately, Tesla’s post-Niagara status as an electrical genius extraordinairewas sufficient to persuade several of his rich New York society friends andadmirers to ante up tens of thousands to perfect his latest amazing invention.By early May 1898, with America’s newly declared war with Spain reaching feverpitch, Tesla was anxious to display his new work before a select audience ofinvited guests—wealthy potential investors—during an electrical exposition atthe vast Moorish-style Madison Square Garden. One always expected somethingunusual, dazzling, and uncanny at a Tesla lecture, strange gadgets andelectrical gizmos capable of throwing out great bolts of light and lightning,but the top-hatted millionaires who walked into the private auditorium this timefound only a very large tank of water and what looked like every boy’s dream, agigantic toy boat five feet long by three feet wide. Nikola Tesla explained thatthey were looking at his perfected remote-controlled robotic boat, what hecalled his “teleautomaton.” He used a handheld transmitter to direct his boat tosail forward, change directions, and turn its lights on and off. While cementinghis reputation as a weird and wonderful wizard, this display thoroughly obscuredthe two major scientific advances—a multichannel broadcasting system andremote-control electronics—embodied in this seemingly oversize toy. Tesladeclared, “You see there the first of a race of robots, mechanical men whichwill do the laborious work of the human race.”33[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts33a] The millionaires were not at allconvinced and left unwilling to open their checkbooks.With little commercial interest in his automatons, Tesla returned to hisprevious love—the infinite generation of wireless electrical power andtransmission. Of course, this would also take large sums of money to moveforward. He targeted his close acquaintance the fabulously wealthy John JacobAstor IV, exhorting him to become a backer of his manifold grandiose electricaldreams. “You will see how many enterprises can be built up on that novelprinciple, Colonel. It is for a reason that I am often and viciously attacked,because my inventions threaten a number of established industries.” Astorbrought Tesla smartly back to earth, writing, “Let us stick to oscillators andcold lights. Let me see some success in the marketplace with these twoenterprises, before you go off saving the world with an invention of an entirelydifferent order, and then I will commit more than my good wishes.” Receivingeven that nibble, Tesla maintained a persistent pursuit, tantalizing Astor bydescribing how “I can run on a wire sufficient for one incandescent lamp morethan 1000 of my own lamps, giving fully 5000 times as much light. Let me askyou, Colonel, how much is this alone worth when you consider that there arehundreds of millions invested today in electric lights?”34[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts34a] By late 1898, Astor capitulatedand bought $30,000 worth of stock in Tesla’s company.Living in his new patron’s famous hotel seemed to be part of this deal, andNikola Tesla left behind the upper-middle-class comforts of the Gerlach Hotelfor the prodigal opulence and society cachet of the luxurious Waldorf-Astoria,an eleven-story German-Renaissance palace at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. Withits numerous elegant public rooms, the Waldorf-Astoria by the last turn of thecentury was the fashionable watering hole for the New York elite, as well as thepreferred hostelry for visiting royalty. Whether it was gala balls or intimatetête-à-têtes where one could watch swells and society ladies passing throughPeacock Alley, the Waldorf-Astoria radiated luxury, privilege, and ostentation.Nikola Tesla settled in happily.Despite Tesla’s practical talk of his new and better light bulb sweeping theworld, as soon as he had Colonel Astor’s money safely in hand, the elegantinventor immediately set aside such prosaic concerns to return to the electricalfrontier he so loved to explore. As he built bigger and more powerfuloscillators and generators that threw out ever greater streamers of electricity,Tesla realized he could not safely continue in his Houston Street laboratory.Leonard Curtis, a friend and patent attorney, had retreated from the stress andstrain of New York legal life to the frontier simplicities of Colorado Springs,a pretty resort at the foot of the pristine Rocky Mountains. There he ran theelectric power company, a now essential part of the local mining industry. Heoffered Tesla free land for a makeshift laboratory outside of town with amajestic view of Pike’s Peak, and free electricity. Tesla began sending aheadhis electrical equipment—copper bars, great rolls of electrical wire, hugegenerators and motors, while he himself followed that spring.When the tall, slender Tesla stepped off the train into the dry, cool air ofColorado Springs on May 19, 1899, he was as far west as he had ever been. Beforehim rose the Rocky Mountains in all their snow-capped violet glory, while thecrisp blue sky at this high altitude seemed to go on forever. The lovely town,set among such magnificent scenery and ringed by meadows of wildflowers, wasalso famous for its healthful mineral springs. Tesla’s old friend Curtis and thetown’s leading dignitaries hospitably welcomed the New York wizard, delighted tohave such an eminent personage grace their small community. They escorted him tothe Alta Vista Hotel and then formally feted him at a great banquet. NikolaTesla stayed in room 207 (divisible by three) at the Alta Vista, his windowlooking out on the mountains, and had eighteen fresh towels delivered eachmorning. Tesla told the local reporters he planned “to send a message fromPike’s Peak to Paris [for the Paris Exposition]…. I will investigate electricaldisturbances in the earth. There are great laws, which I want to discover, andprinciples to command.”35 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts35a]While Colonel Astor, off on a European tour, no doubt assumed Tesla wasattending to the practical details of conquering the world with his “cold”light, the great inventor was instead contemplating far more exalted concerns ashe began to construct his Colorado Springs laboratory at six thousand feet abovesea level. The first concern was how to design and build the most powerfulelectrical transmitter ever. Then once that was up and running, Tesla wasseeking to individualize and isolate the energy that his supertransmitter sentforth into the atmosphere. Finally, he wanted to determine whether the earth andits atmosphere were—as he suspected—resonating at specific frequencies. How didsuch energy waves travel?To answer these questions, Tesla had constructed, far beyond the edge of town ona prairie pasture, a huge wooden barnlike structure with a retractable roof,braced on three sides with wooden supports. Jutting up was a wooden towerholding a single two-hundred-foot-tall copper pole topped with a yard-widecopper ball. The copper pole rose from the largest Tesla coil yet, which theinventor referred to as his “magnifying transformer,” capable of generating 100million volts. The inside of the barnlike structure appeared to be some kind ofriding ring, a wide circular space hemmed in on all sides by a tall woodenfence. The plain plank floor was filled with electrical equipment that turnedout to be Tesla’s transmitter, built to operate on the local AC from theColorado Springs power station. It was then sent through a transformer to hugelyincrease voltage. Outside the wooden arena sat Tesla’s receiving stations, whichto the untrained eye mainly looked like gigantic cans. Tesla had one assistanthe had brought from New York, a young man sworn to deepest secrecy. To keep awaythe inevitable electrical sightseers, Tesla put up a tall fence and posted manysigns warning “Keep Out, Great Danger.” One reporter who ventured into thecompound to peer through the windows found Tesla’s assistant next to him saying,“Your life is in peril and you would be a great deal safer if you would removeyourself from the vicinity.”36 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts36a]To Nikola Tesla’s delight, Colorado Springs had frequent, gigantic, crashingthunderstorms. On July 3, 1899, Tesla was working on getting his laboratoryinstalled when he noticed dark clouds massing in the west, boiling up until theyerupted into a violent electrical storm that passed over the plain and recededfar into the distance. It was then “I obtained the first decisive experimentalevidence of a truth of overwhelming importance for the advancement of humanity,”he would later write. On his instruments Tesla saw recorded “heavy and longpersistent [electrical] arcs” as the storm passed and then became fainter andfainter. The storm came and went, but the equipment continued to recordelectrical activity waxing and waning at a regular rate. These were standingelectrical waves. “No doubt whatever remained: I was observing stationarywaves…. The tremendous significance of this fact in the transmission of energyby my system had already become quite clear to me. Not only was it practicableto send telegraphic messages to any distance without wires, as I recognized longago, but also to impress upon the entire globe the faint modulations of thehuman voice, far more still, to transmit power, in unlimited amounts to anyterrestrial distance and almost without loss.”37[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts37a] Tesla now firmly believed energycould be transmitted without wires.He continued to construct his powerful magnifying transformer, and finally theevening came when he was ready to test it. As the darkness settled its coolvelvet mantle over the Rockies, Tesla stationed himself where he could watch thecopper pole. Dressed for the occasion in his best cutaway, derby hat, and thickrubber-soled shoes, he signaled his helper inside to turn on the switch. He sawa ten-foot blue spark spurt from the copper ball, then another, and another,each longer, bluer, until they crackled forth in huge bolts forty, fifty, sixtyfeet long, then a hundred feet, each setting off a great crack of thunder.Inside the barn laboratory, the whole atmosphere was alive with a blue aura anddancing sparks. Joyously, Tesla looked back up at the copper ball—lightning 130feet long was spurting out, a brilliant flash that brought on a gigantic crashof thunder. Then all went dead and the smell of ozone was overpowering. Itbecame so quiet, the wind could be heard rustling through the mountain grasses.Tesla rushed in to scold his assistant, but all their power was gone. When theylooked over at Colorado Springs, it, too, was dark. Tesla had blown out thetown’s powerhouse.All summer, fall, and winter, Tesla happily explored this unmapped terrain ofhigh voltages, the earth’s resonance, and electrical waves. He had spectacularphotographs taken showing him sitting in the laboratory reading while greatbolts of lightning played about him. These were, in fact, double exposures, butwhen published subsequently, they only reinforced his reputation as anincredible electrical wizard, a man capable of making lightning to rival theangry gods. Finally, in late January of 1900, Tesla had to pull himself awayfrom these fascinating experiments and return to New York.When Nikola Tesla debarked in effulgent glory at Gotham, he found the pulsatingcity in a greater frenzy of moneymaking than ever. At long, long last, theAmerican economy had recovered from the searing depression of the 1890s.Manhattan’s streets were still jammed with horse-drawn vehicles, but now theysparred for space with the electric trolleys and the new plaything of thewealthy, the motorcar. Tesla settled happily back into the opulence of theWaldorf-Astoria, enjoying his own celebrity as he strolled through PeacockAlley, resplendent in his beautifully tailored Prince Albert coat, four-in-handtie, white silk shirt, favorite green suede high-top boots, silver-topped cane,kidskin gloves, and those famously flashing eyes. Nikola Tesla reclaimed hisplace in New York society’s whirl of lavish dinners, opera soirees, and dinnersat Delmonico’s or Sherry’s, always keeping an eye out for possible wealthyinvestors. His laboratory in Colorado Springs had been an exhilarating,expensive foray, and once again his coffers were empty. Moreover, he had nomajor commercial venture for generating new and future income. Of course, heapproached Colonel Astor again, only to find him now politely indifferent to theman who had put aside “cold” light to pursue electrical chimeras.To keep his profile high and entice new backers, Tesla offered to write anarticle for his dearest friend, Robert Underwood Johnson, an editor at Centurymagazine. Johnson, who eagerly commissioned the piece, was appalled when Teslasubmitted a long, tendentious mélange of philosophy and science titled “TheProblem of Increasing Human Energy.” Tesla refused all editorial suggestions, soCentury went ahead and published the whole rambling thing in June 1900. Thearticle was most memorable for the amazing photos of Tesla taken at his ColoradoSprings laboratory. It all caused a sensation, much of it negative. For someyears now, Tesla had kept himself arrogantly aloof from his fellow engineers,disparaging the work of others, blithely describing feats and projects of hisown that then never materialized. A decade earlier, he had begun criticizingEdison’s incandescent light bulb as expensive and wasteful and prophesying itsimminent demise at the hands of his, Tesla’s, far superior “cold” light. Yetwhere was this much ballyhooed light? Tesla had done too much self-aggrandizingand expressed too much disdain for other electricians. His electrical peers weremore than ready to pounce upon his strange and boastful writings. His subsequentassertion that he was in touch with Martians, based on radio signals receivedfrom outer space while in Colorado, did nothing to lessen the scoffing. Broke asever, in early December 1900 Tesla asked Westinghouse if he could extend anearlier $3,000 loan he could not afford to repay.Just at this discouraging moment, Nikola Tesla was rescued from financialdespair by none other than J. Pierpont Morgan, now Wall Street’s most fearsome,feared, and powerful financier. Tesla, circulating as he did in New York’srichest social circles, had become something of a favorite with Morgan’s growndaughter, Anne, twenty-eight. One evening after dinner at the family’sItalianate mansion, bedecked with a rich mix of Morgan’s fast-growingcollections of European paintings and precious antiques and curiosities, Teslahad managed to persuade the great banker to consider backing his new venture,for Tesla was fervent in his desire to build his great electrical dream, his“World System” of power transmission. However, just as Colonel Astor wanted toinvest in “cold” light, so J. Pierpont Morgan had one focused interest—worldtelegraphy. He knew Tesla’s AC patents had trumped all else at Niagara. What wasto say his wireless patents would not prevail again in this latest race, therace to span the ocean skies with invisible, electrical words?Morgan seems to have also alleviated Tesla’s immediate pressing shortage ofmoney, for on December 12 Tesla penned a scrawled, almost pathetic letter ofgratitude: “How can I begin to thank you…. My work will proclaim loudly yourname to the world!”38 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts38a] Over thenext few months, Tesla, who had initially imagined himself selling $150,000worth of shares in a company to Morgan, found himself thoroughly cornered, withthe ruthless financier at the last minute adding (as a condition to closing thedeal) 51 percent ownership of Tesla’s patents not just for wireless, but alsofor the same “cold” light that Colonel Astor imagined he had a major interestin. Tesla, desperate to silence the rising clamor of his sneering critics withhis “World System” of worldwide power and instant communication, acquiesced. Byearly March 1901, he finally had the prospect of funds. Yet could either Morganor Tesla possibly have imagined this would be sufficient to launch any majorelectrical venture? Lighting the World’s Fair had been a $500,000 contract.Niagara alone had cost $6 million before ever a penny was earned.Presumably, all Tesla could think about was at least getting launched. Hepurchased two hundred acres out on a rural tract at Shoreham, Long Island, andby July 1901 was building his great dream, the Wardenclyffe tower, a strange,giant erector-set structure that rose 187 feet and was topped with a largeglobelike dome. Below the tower a shaft traveled 120 feet into the ground, whilesixteen iron pipes pushed into the bowels yet another 300 feet, “gripping theearth.” Across the fields stood an attractive laboratory building designed byhis friend Stanford White. But just as Tesla was busy creating his mysterioustower, Marconi stunned the world on December 12, 1901, by successfullytransmitting the letter S across the Atlantic. Tesla had believed for some timethat Marconi was infringing on many of his patents, but Tesla, like Edison inthe early days of the light bulb, could not be bothered at first by inferior“patent pirates.” And by the time he saw Marconi for the true threat he was, hecould not possibly afford—as Edison and Westinghouse had—to send in battalionsof lawyers. He could barely pay for his expensive life at the Waldorf-Astoria.By January 2, 1902, Tesla needed more money if he was to complete his electricaltower and was pressing Morgan accordingly: “Now, Mr. Morgan, am I backed by thegreatest financier of all times? And shall I lose great triumphs and an immensefortune because I need a sum of money!!”39[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts39a] But Morgan could not see why heshould pour more money into such a huge and expensive enterprise for wirelesscommunication when Guglielmo Marconi had already succeeded with much less. Teslaexplained the far more grandiose plans he had—the almost finished tower was notfor mere prosaic transatlantic telegraphy but was a gigantic transmitter thatwould be capable of generating 10 million horsepower to straddle the globe withwireless communication and cheap electric power. “Will you help me or let mygreat work—almost complete—go to pot?” he asked.Morgan was not impressed, just deeply irritated that he had been snookered intosquandering his money on visionary schemes. Not only was he adamant that “Ishould not feel disposed at present to make any further advances,” he was alsounwilling to return to Tesla his patents, thereby preventing him from findingothers to back him commercially.40[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts40a] When Tesla humbly presentedhimself at Morgan’s Wall Street office in January of 1904 to “show you that Ihave done the best that could be done, you fire me out like an office boy androar so that you are heard six blocks away; not a cent. It is spread all overtown, I am discredited, the laughing stock of my enemies.”41[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts41a] (We don’t know if Tesla evenapproached Westinghouse for money for Wardenclyffe, but it seems likely that hedid and was rebuffed there, also.)Tesla’s biographers have all wondered whether J. P. Morgan, with his biginvestment in GE, deliberately sabotaged Tesla in his dream of developing asuperior system of wireless energy. Morgan certainly had huge stakes in stillexpanding electrical power systems all over America (and elsewhere in theworld). He drove a hard bargain to obtain control of Tesla’s patents and thenwould not relinquish them for development by someone else. Morgan might have hadcompelling reasons to thwart a new, untried, and possibly revolutionarytechnology, one that would make obsolete Morgan’s own efforts and giantinvestments. But by this time the ever idealistic, ever naive Tesla also had aterrible track record—with the notable exception of his Westinghouse ACcollaboration—of turning his brilliant ideas and inventions into commerciallyviable products. So the hard-nosed Morgan may simply have felt that he had paidgood money and had nothing to show for it but the possibly valuable patents.The desperate Tesla wrote Morgan long, lovelorn letters, piteous pleas thatenumerated for page after page the reasons the giant of Wall Street shouldrecommit to their brief, unfinished relationship. Tesla just did not seem tograsp that a tough-hearted titan like Morgan was not likely to be moved by suchflowery confessions as “There has been hardly a night when my pillow was notbathed in tears, but you must not think me weak for that, I am perfectly sure tofinish my task, come what may.”42[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts42a] This elicited a reply fromMorgan’s private secretary that “Mr. J. P. Morgan wishes me to inform you thatit will be impossible for him to do anything more in the matter.”43[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts43a] Tesla consoled himself bywriting to the indifferent Morgan that the financier’s work was “wrought inpassing form. Mine is immortal.”To this day, Wardenclyffe remains a scientific mystery. How exactly did Teslaplan to carry out his incredibly ambitious plan? Did he possess technology thatwould really work and do what he claimed? There had been an enormous amount ofpractical work and gigantic financial investments required to make Tesla’s ACmotors work in the real world, necessary development work that he often airilyoverlooked. Not only could Tesla not afford to move forward on his almostfinished tower, he could not even afford the lawyers he desperately needed todefend his many patents, depriving him of all sorts of royalties. A loner bynature, unattached to the power and prestige of a great university or a majorcorporation, Tesla was at a total disadvantage. By 1905, he could no longerafford the laboratory out at Wardenclyffe. Over the next decade, he poured hisinventive energy into turbines, but lack of money and the skepticism of hispeers meant that yet again these machines never became fully developedcommercial products. After J. P. Morgan died in 1913, Tesla soon began appealingto his financier son. Just before Christmas of 1913, he wrote, “I need moneybadly and I cannot get it in these dreadful times.”44[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts44a] The younger Morgan took pity andsent Tesla $5,000 at the Waldorf-Astoria.Four years later, when the American Institute of Electrical Engineers bestowedits 1917 Edison Medal upon Tesla, the main speaker pointed out, “Were we toseize and eliminate from our industrial world the results of Mr. Tesla’s work,the wheels of industry would cease to turn, our electric cars and trains wouldstop, our towns would be dark, our mills would be dead and idle. Yes, so farreaching is this work, that it has become the warp and woof of industry.”45[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts45a] Yet in the previous year, 1916,the man whose alternating current inventions literally powered the modern worldhad had to declare bankruptcy. Unable to pay his bills, Tesla eventually had torelinquish the mortgage for his beloved (and never completed) Wardenclyffe towerto the Waldorf-Astoria, where he had lived since 1898 and was $20,000 in arrearson his bill. In an effort to make the land easier to sell, the hotel blew up thetower.George Westinghouse had died in 1914, but Tesla continued to ply the electriccompany with ideas in the hopes that they would once again develop hisinventions, especially when they entered the new field of radio. In 1920, Teslawas still offering his services, “provided your company is willing to come to anunderstanding with me on terms decidedly more generous than those under whichthey acquired my system of power transmission thirty years ago.”46[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts46a] Again and again, the companypolitely said no. In 1930, Tesla became convinced that the Westinghouse peoplehad pirated some of his early transmission patents and threatened in a letter,“It would be painful to me to have to resort to legal proceedings against agreat corporation whose business is largely founded on my inventions.”47[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts47a] Sadly broke and understandablybitter, Tesla wrote a letter to the New York World complaining, “Had the Edisoncompanies not finally adopted my invention they would have been wiped out ofexistence, and yet not the slightest acknowledgment of my labors has ever beenmade by any of them, a remarkable instance of the proverbial unfairness andingratitude of corporations.”48 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts48a]This proud, brilliant eccentric continued to earn fees occasionally as aconsultant, but he did not do well in corporate settings. He wrote articles fromtime to time, often nostalgic pieces about his role in the rise of electricity.Yet so great were Nikola Tesla’s early contributions and so prescient did hismany “fantastical” predictions prove as the years and decades unfolded, theaging inventor always had a steady and loyal coterie of admirers who sought himout, young science writers like John J. O’Neill, up-and-coming scientistsinspired by his work and writings, and old comrades from the Westinghouse dayslike Charles Scott, eminent professor of engineering. They made sure he receivedsome honors, organizing on the occasion of his seventy-fifth birthday in 1931 aFestschrift that hailed his great contributions. Time magazine featured Tesla onthe cover and celebrated him as an eccentric genius for the ages. “I have beenleading a secluded life, one of continuous, concentrated thought and deepmeditation,” he was quoted as saying. “Naturally enough I have accumulated agreat number of ideas. The question is whether my physical powers will beadequate to working them out and giving them to the world.”49[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts49a]The Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company—worried about the badpublicity of an elderly, impoverished Tesla—decided in 1934 to begin paying hismonthly bill at his new residence, room 3327 (divisible by three) on thethirty-third floor of the new skyscraper Hotel New Yorker. It was a piddling andinsulting sum—$125 a month—for one who had given up so many millions to save thecompany long ago. In contrast, GE paid the inventor William Stanley, anotherelderly electrical pioneer on hard times, a stipend of $1,000 a month. TheYugoslav government also began to contribute a small pension. Tesla continued toinvent, and when he announced patenting a new “death ray” weapon at the start ofWorld War II, the press gave it great play. All told, Tesla had 111 Americanpatents, and there were apparently many other inventions he never bothered toregister. But lacking any major backer, most of his inventions remained eithercompletely theoretical or were never fully developed for real commercial use.More and more, Tesla lived in his own world, as big a romantic as ever, and aseccentric. He had his vegetarian meals specially cooked by the hotel chef andinsisted that the help not get closer to him than a few feet, part of his phobiaof germs. He had finally abandoned wearing his old-fashioned frock coats and hiskid gloves for a regular well-tailored business suit. Nikola Tesla in his lateryears developed a strange passion for pigeons. Never having married and with allhis relatives back in Europe, he found solace and a certain familialcompanionship with these cooing, waddling birds. He had long outlived most ofhis old friends, Robert Johnson, Stanford White, Mark Twain. So he took towhiling away the hours by feeding and talking to the pigeons outside the NewYork Public Library and St. Patrick’s Cathedral, often late at night. If hefound a bird that was sick or injured, he rescued it and smuggled it into hishotel room to nurse it back to health. A particularly elegant white pigeon wasdeeply beloved.One evening the elderly, almost cadaverous Nikola Tesla told John J. O’Neillabout the white pigeon while they were sitting and visiting in the lobby of theHotel New Yorker. Tesla said, “I loved that pigeon. Yes, I loved her as a manloves a woman, and she loved me…. As long as I had her, there was a purpose inmy life. Then one night as I was lying in my bed in the dark, solving problems,as usual, she flew in through the open window and stood on my desk…. As I lookedat her I knew she wanted to tell me—she was dying…. When that pigeon died,something went out of my life. Up to that time I knew with a certainty that Iwould complete my work, no matter how ambitious my program, but when thatsomething went out of my life I knew my life’s work was finished.”50[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts50a]On January 7, 1943, as snow tumbled past his room on the thirty-third floor ofthe Hotel New Yorker and World War II raged across the globe, Nikola Tesla diedin his bed, age eighty-six, alone and impecunious. Though Tesla had long been anAmerican citizen, the Yugoslav government made sure his funeral was a grandoccasion at the magnificent Cathedral of St. John the Divine up in MorningsideHeights. Two thousand mourners came on January 12 to pay their respects to thiselectrical genius. The U.S. government secretly confiscated some of his papers,concerned that they contained potentially important scientific material.Sadly, Tesla died too soon to savor one last wonderful vindication. The wholeworld believed Marconi to be the father of radio. Yet when Marconi brought suitagainst the U.S. government for infringing on his radio patents, the U.S.Supreme Court ruled that the record showed that Marconi’s patents infringed onthose of Tesla! Though here, as with most of his inventions, Tesla had not donethe hard labor of creating a commercially viable product.To this day, Nikola Tesla remains a brilliant but enigmatic figure, a scientist,inventor, dreamer, and visionary whose post-Niagara scientific contributions arethe source of great debate. Did he degenerate into a kook, or was he justdecades ahead of his time? Electricity had created many, many millionaires. ButTesla, who made possible the electric age, was never one of them. Still, he didlive to see his AC system straddle the globe, illuminating nation after nationand powering millions of motors. Almost sixty years after he had stepped ashorein New York, dreaming a big dream of electrifying the world, that dream had morethan come to pass.ELECTRICITYAnd what of electricity itself, that “subtle, vivifying fluid”? As electricpower became more versatile, more reliable, more prosaic, the most far-fetchedelectrical dreams of these three Promethean creators—Edison, Westinghouse, andTesla—were fulfilled. The Niagara powerhouses added generator after generatorand even in 1902 were providing a fifth of all electricity in the United States.As described in historian David E. Nye’s book Electrifying America, by 1910American business and industry were eagerly incorporating electricity into theirdaily operations, dramatically raising productivity. By 1940, when electricityhad spread throughout society, American productivity had risen 300 percent.Edison biographer Matthew Josephson calculated that assembly-line plants such asthose run by automaker Henry Ford saw efficiency rise 50 percent. Whileelectricity was by no means the only explanation, it played an important part inthe tremendous ensuing rise in living standards. The cost of electricitydeclined steadily as it was generated far more efficiently. In 1902, 7.3 poundsof coal were needed to generate 1 kilowatt-hour in a central station. By 1932,that figure was down to 1.5 pounds of coal.51[Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts51a]Residential electrical service, however, spread far more slowly. This was partlybecause power companies concentrated first on wooing and supplying moreprofitable business customers. But it was also because in the early yearselectricity was still a luxury, more expensive than gas, and not as reliable.Nationwide, in 1907, only 8 percent of Americans lived in homes served byelectricity. By 1920, that figure had risen, but only to 35 percent. As electricservice improved and costs dropped, Americans signed up for electricity in theirhomes as eagerly as had business. In major cities like Chicago, 95 percent ofhomes had electricity by the 1920s.To appreciate the universality of electricity in American urban homes by 1930,one has only to consider that even in a midsize midwestern city like Muncie,Indiana, 95 percent of families had electricity. This was true even though morethan a third still had no bath and a fifth still used outhouses. Yet virtuallyevery Muncie household opted for the electricity that allowed one to sit forhours during the darkest evenings in a bright room and suffer no strained eyesor gas-induced headaches. Equally persuasive were such labor-saving conveniencesas electric irons, vacuums (750,000 sold in 1919), washing machines, toasters,and hot-water heaters. Just thirty years after Edison figured out how to buildthe first power grid, electricity was changing the daily tenor of life all overurban America. Many a wife happily dispensed with the maid and did the noweasier job of housekeeping herself.For all the convenience of lamps and washing machines, probably no earlyelectrical appliance brought such change (and pleasure) into the American homeas the radio in the early 1920s. For the first time, just as Tesla had oncepredicted, people could tune in to the world far distant, receiving new voicesand sounds from a big wooden box. Now, when their ball team played out of town,or the president gave a speech, or a famous soprano sang in New York, Americanscould follow these events. The soap operas kept them enthralled, comedy hourslightened their days. Was it surprising that within a decade almost everyAmerican family (with electricity) had a radio? It would probably be hard tooverstate the influence of radio in both knitting together the nation andinspiring many a small-town boy or girl to more exciting ambitions. Electricalpower made possible the important and the frivolous, the noble and the idiotic.Because electricity was viewed strictly as a commercial commodity in these earlydecades, access to electricity came far more slowly for citizens out in thehinterlands, where a third of Americans still lived in the 1930s. As late as1934, only a tenth of the nation’s farms had electricity, for service wasdetermined by profitability. It was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt whofirst proposed the radical notion that isolated farmers were as entitled to theliberating benefits of electricity as Americans living in cities and suburbs.The private utilities, which had long seen electricity strictly as an economicproposition, balked. The New Deal stepped forward with government-backed ruralelectrification projects. Even so, it would take twenty-five years for thehigh-tension wires carrying electricity to straddle the hills and prairies intoeven the most remote farms, finally ending their long dependence on tallowcandles and kerosene lamps. During these decades, as electricity became theinvisible lifeblood of our modern civilization, its price dropped almost byhalf. Farmers were as quick as the businessmen and housewives to put electricityto work doing all kinds of drudgery.For all the immense gains and almost magical gifts that electricity bestowed,there were, of course, some small losses, felt only by a few. The world, nowpowered by machines, became far noisier. The hum, rumble, and roar of motors andengines, the persistent sound of electrically amplified noises, all came to fillthe air. Natural sounds, just plain silence, were drowned out by man-made din.The once ubiquitous horse largely disappeared, no longer needed for mobility orsheer horsepower. The American night sky, once truly black and blazing withbillions of glistening stars, decade by decade became steadily more permeated byman-made electric light, until now, when the sun sets and true darknessdescends, it is not inky black, but an orange gray color, especially just abovethe horizon. In consequence, the stars, especially the Milky Way, are difficultand often impossible to see. In Electrifying America, one man laments, “We ofthe age of machines, having delivered ourselves of nocturnal enemies, now have adislike of night itself…. Today’s civilization is full of people who have notthe slightest notion of the character or the poetry of the night, who have nevereven seen night.”52 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_nts_r1.htm#c13-nts52a] Electricityallowed a greater regimentation of life, ripping away the natural rhythms oftime and season. The quieting of work and home as the natural light disappearedno longer existed, nor did families gather about the hearth for heat and light.Men, women, and children retreated more and more into their comfortable andconvenient homes or became more and more obliged to toil on in theirwell-lighted offices and factories.The rise of such electrical machines as radio, movies, television, videos,computers, and the Internet also meant the rise of life at a remove, lifeexperienced passively through a screen, the watching and observing of activitiesorganized and presented by others. Before electricity, men, women, and childrenwho wanted to enjoy music, theater, dance, politics, speeches, or sports werepresent as active participants or spectators. Nineteenth-century humanexperience was firsthand, in person, intimate, authentic, with the notableexception of that described by the written word and still images, whetherpaintings or photographs. With electricity came a veritable cornucopia ofpossible new human experiences, far more than most modern people can begin toabsorb. But many of them are experienced secondhand.Nikola Tesla lived to see his great invention, his great gift to mankind, spreadacross the landscape, brightening homes, enlivening communities, and enrichingthe whole country, just as he had hoped. Despite the travails and frustrationsof his later life, Tesla, ever the idealist, said: “I continually experience aninexpressible satisfaction from the knowledge that my polyphase system is usedthroughout the world to lighten the burdens of mankind and increase comfort andhappiness.” The rise of the railroads and the telegraph changed forever age-oldnotions of distance and time; the steam engine had already hinted at thepotential of machine-created energy. Electricity unleashed the Second IndustrialRevolution, bestowing on man incredible gifts: the untold hours once lost tosimple darkness, the even greater hours lost to drudging human labor, and theconsequent freeing and flourishing of the human mind and imagination. Evenacknowledging a loss of nineteenth-century intimacy and authenticity, theintrusion of perpetual din, and the mechanized rush of modern life, the comingof electricity ultimately expanded the whole human sense of time, energy, andpossibility. Great, indeed, has been the power of electricity."},{"pageContent":"NotesCHAPTER 1“Morgan’s House Was Lighted Up Last Night”1 [Jonn_9781588360007_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts1].James D.

Edison, but the most recent(1998) and most useful for me was Paul Israel’s Edison: A Life of Invention,which concentrates on the science and business. Paul Israel also coauthored withRobert Friedel and Bernard S. Finn Edison’s Electric Light: Biography of anInvention (1986), which provided wonderful specifics about the momentous andarduous invention of the light bulb. Francis Jehl’s three-volume Menlo ParkDiaries (1937) serves up an incredible wealth of engaging detail but is notalways reliable. Matthew Josephson’s Edison: A Biography (1959), the first todraw on the large and amazing Edison archives, is a good read and gives a niceflavor of the era. About the time I began work on this book, almost half of thevast Rutgers University Edison archives, a cornucopia of invaluable primarysource material, became available on-line.For Nikola Tesla, John J. O’Neill’s biography, Prodigal Genius, was a greatintroduction, authored as it was by a science writer who knew Tesla. It waspublished in 1944 shortly after Tesla’s death. Marc Seifer’s helpful 1996biography, Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla, was able to draw on muchmaterial unavailable to O’Neill. Other important sources were Tesla’s letters inthe Library of Congress and the Niagara Mohawk archives. There are numeroususeful published collections of Tesla’s lectures, writings, and patentapplications, as well as articles about him, often labors of love by Tesla’smany dedicated fans. Margaret Cheney and filmmaker Robert Uth wrote Tesla:Master of Lightning (1999), an excellent heavily illustrated coffee tablebiography that is the companion book to Uth’s PBS documentary of the same title.Unfortunately, no new biography has been written of George Westinghouse sinceHenry G. Prout’s A Life of George Westinghouse (1926) was commissioned by theWestinghouse Corporation, which apparently felt Francis E. Leupp’s GeorgeWestinghouse: His Life and Achievements (1918) was inadequate. Anyonecontemplating a new biography of the great Pittsburgh magnate would have quicklybeen discouraged by the incredible paucity of primary sources, a problem evenProut and Leupp complained about. Westinghouse did not, like Edison and Tesla,preserve his personal letters and papers, nor did he make himself available tothe press. However, when business historian Harold C. Passer wrote hismagnificent classic work, The Electrical Manufacturers, 1875–1900 (1953), he wasable to elaborate on many fascinating Westinghouse episodes using what he calledthe “Historic Westinghouse Archives” at the company’s Pittsburgh headquarters.Tellingly, Passer, a Harvard Business School scholar, appears to be the onlyhistorian ever given unfettered access to those archives. Thereafter, all accesswas heavily vetted. Sadly, when CBS dismantled the Westinghouse Corporation inthe late 1990s, the historic archives seemed to disappear. However, fragmentsremain in a small archive at the George Westinghouse Museum in Wilmerdingoutside Pittsburgh, where one can find a large and well-organized trove ofreminiscences about Westinghouse gathered and organized in the 1930s.David E. Nye’s Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology (1990)was most illuminating on the national experience as light and power spread,while Andreas Bluhm and Louise Lippincott’s Light! The Industrial Age 1750–1900(2000), a sumptuous art catalog to a 2001 show by the same name in Pittsburgh,provided a fascinating look at how societies and artists absorbed these newtechnologies.When writing about New York City, I found Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace’swonderful Gotham (1999) and Kenneth T. Jackson’s incredible Encyclopedia of NewYork City (1995) invaluable. For Pittsburgh, I was grateful to find StefanLorant’s great work, Pittsburgh (1964). For Chicago, I turned to Donald L.Miller’s excellent City of the Century (1996), and for Niagara Falls, to PierreBerton’s amusing Niagara (1992) and the Anthology and Bibliography of NiagaraFalls compiled by Charles Mason Dow (1921). Other important Niagara sources wereRobert Belfield’s 1981 Ph.D. thesis, “Niagara Frontier,” and the archives EdwardDean Adams carefully assembled to document the building of the Niagarahydroelectric power plants. These archives, preserved by the Niagara MohawkPower Corporation in Syracuse (since acquired by National Grid USA Company,Inc.), are a necessary antidote to Edward Dean Adams’s official two-volumehistory, Niagara Power (1927), which for all its majesty is still oftenconfusing and sanitizes or simply ignores all troubles."},{"pageContent":"AcknowledgmentsIn the course of researching and writing this book, I have been helped by manypeople. First, I would like to thank my agent, Eric Simonoff at Janklow &Nesbit, who offered excellent advice every step of the way, and Katie Hall, myeditor at Random House, who provided superlative editing and all-around energyand intelligent enthusiasm.Paul Israel at the Thomas Edison Papers at Rutgers University responded to manyquestions, helping me and Sarah McKinney of Random House navigate the vast andwondrous Edison on-line archive. He also carefully read and commented upon mymanuscript. Both Israel’s excellent biography, Edison: A Life of Invention, andhis fascinating work with Robert Friedel and Bernard S. Finn, Edison’s ElectricLight: Biography of an Invention, were indispensable to this book. Over at theEdison National Historic Site in West Orange, New Jersey, Doug Tarr was mosthelpful with photographs. At the Smithsonian Institution, Bernard S. Finn, andHarold Wallace at the Museum of American History answered numerous queries andkindly demonstrated some of the early electrical apparatus in their collections.Robert F. Dischner, Ph.D., of USA Service Company, Inc., stands out for hiswonderful enthusiasm for this project and his constant support. He came fromSyracuse to serve as a personal guide around Buffalo and Niagara Falls,introducing me to Maureen Fennie, head of the local history room at the NiagaraFalls Public Library. The librarians at the Buffalo & Erie County HistoricalSociety were also efficient and most helpful during my visit to thatinstitution. Dischner provided invaluable access to the original Niagara Powerarchives and the papers of Edward Dean Adams. National Grid USA archivist JosephSantore did a yeoman’s job of locating files, letters, and photographs.Out in Pittsburgh, Edward Reis, head of the George Westinghouse Museum inWilmerding, arranged for me to spend two days in their archives there, whichyielded invaluable material. My daughter Hilary was my first-rate assistantthere. Professor Tim Ziaukas of the University of Pittsburgh’s Bradford campussmoothed the way for that trip and then shared what he had found in his own workin the Westinghouse files. He then kindly reviewed my manuscript. Richard Priceat the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania performed useful researchthere on my behalf. In Boston, Debbie Funkhouser carefully combed the historicalfiles of the Harvard Business School’s Baker Library and the MassachusettsHistorical Society, looking for Westinghouse material. In New York, SarahMcKinney of Random House spent many hours gathering old newspaper coverage aboutthe electric chair battle and mining the on-line Edison archives for all mannerof important documents. Also in New York, Christine Nelson at the Morgan Libraryprovided needed manuscripts from their archives. In Philadelphia, Valerie-AnneLutz of the American Philosophical Society quickly sent along the NiagaraFalls–related papers of Coleman Sellers. Christopher Baer of the Hagley Museumand Library outside Wilmington, Delaware, rapidly answered all queries having todo with the Pennsylvania Railroad. At Random House, Danielle Durkin was veryhelpful in the final stages of the book.In Washington, D.C., the librarians at the Library of Congress’s Division ofManuscripts were most friendly when assisting me with the Tesla papers.Filmmaker Robert Uth, whose two-part documentary on Tesla ran on PBS, was veryhelpful in putting me in touch with the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade andother Tesla groups when I was looking for photos. Professor W. Bernard Carlson,who has been working on a new Tesla biography, generously shared an article indraft and had a number of useful discussions as I was getting started. Here inBaltimore, I must once again thank the librarians at Johns Hopkins University’sMilton S. Eisenhower Library for all their stellar efforts, especially those inthe Inter-Library Loan Office. I could not write my books without theirgood-natured, informed help. Also here in Baltimore, I was fortunate to visitthe incomparable Light Bulb Museum, where one can see original Edison bulbs andWestinghouse stopper lights.I would also like to offer heartfelt appreciation to the numerous people whotook the time to read and critique my manuscript. They were Paul Israel; RobertDischner; Tim Ziaukas; my husband, Christopher Ross; my uncle, inventor andentrepreneur Nelson Jonnes; IBM executive (and onetime science teacher) VictorRomita; and New York City history buff Robert Sarlin. All had many usefulcomments that helped improve the manuscript. I am grateful to Christopher Buck,whose early enthusiasm for this story fired my own, and to Deborah Buck for herdelightful hospitality. Finally, special thanks to my father-in-law, artist JohnRoss, who drew such excellent and useful diagrams to explain the mysteries ofelectricity."},{"pageContent":"About the AuthorJILL JONNES is an author and historian with a Ph.D. from Johns HopkinsUniversity.
