It is, of course, not to be expected that technical experts, however, skilled in their own research field, have the necessary in-depth trai ning that applies to discoveries extending beyond what is currently taught in academic institutions. The specialists of th e world of 'invention' are really those who are p rofessionally skilled in patent matt ers, whose approach is not that of 'peer re view' in a scientific sense but rather one which embraces , without bias, what an inventor claims to have created and then j udges on novelty and merit with attention focused on the prospective practi cal implementation and the technolo g ical si g nificance.

Without such a briefing, technical advisors called upon to comment on the commercial viability of a 'new science' invention, especially one that is at the 'drawing board' stage, could not undertake a meaningful assessment. N o doubt, this report will be read by individuals who are enthusiastic on the 'free energy' front and are searching for new experimental ideas to ta ke that interest forward. Those readers should, however, understand that the intention here is not to communicate project details aimed at the 'free energy' movement generally. The intention, very simply, is to provide the reader with enough technical and scientific e ducational insight so that he or she can grasp the significance of what is represented in the patent cover that will later be as sociated with this report. In short, this report is intended as a marketing aid prelim inary to presenting invention ri ghts for prospective exploitation by corporate or entrepreneurial interests. It follows therefore that this report should in no way be deemed to confer any implied right of use in c onnection with what is di sclosed, as all possible p roprietary rights are reserved, c onsistent with this report being made available on a non-confidential but restricted circulation basis. 'Free Energy': Defining the Field of Investigation The words 'free energy' used in the introduction need explanation. This is an expression which has come into use in an international communication ne twork. It simply means a prospective source of clean energy that is in abundant supply and not subject to territorial or clim atic limitations, but one that has yet to emerge on the industrial scene. In a sense one can imagine that engines running on 'f ree energy' would be classified as 'perpetual motion' machines, but here one needs to clarify te rminology and concept. 'Perpetual motion' may be defined as that which, owing to a cosmic infl uence communicated via the action quantum named after Planck, results in a sustained energy activity in matter which aris es from an equilibrium state as between matter and a 'field' medium in space. Thus, there is perpetual motion in us all. The human body comprises atoms in which electrons move ceas elessly with quantized motion. Even if we die and our bodies are cooled to absolute zero of temperature, to a temper ature below the 2.7 K of cosmic space, that motion persists , because those electrons never stop moving. The atoms with their electron motion have perpetual li fe unless transmuted by the E = Mc 2 rule into a pure energy form that then dissipates into space. There is, evenso, a regenerative process in Nature by which forms of matter can be created and the secret of al l this activity lies in the understanding of: (a) the nature of gravitation (b) the nature of magnetism (c) the nature of the photon, and (d) the nature of the aether. The scientific establishment ha s not, as yet, provided any accepte d explanation for any of these p hysical phenomena. For example, until there is an accepted and valid deriva tion of the measured quantity 137.0359, the 'over-unity' vers ion of the fine-struc ture constant, which is the key to the p hoton action and the energy quantum already menti oned, those 'experts' cannot deny energy transfer from vacuum to matter via the quantum proce ss. Any such denial would only amount to a declaration that obtaining energy fr om space to serve a useful end is 'contrary to experience', meaning no more than that the fruits of future inven tion implicit in this pursuit have not yet come to market. As to gravitation, all that has been offered by thos e who claim authority on that subject is that it arises from the distortion of s p ace-time, which is another word for 'aether'. Yet, the aether is the Pa g e 2 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"space medium that is alive with energy, and the rela tivistic philosophy avoids the vision of the aether as an energy source and gives us instead Einstein's four-dimensional space-time as something that is 'distorted' in a way that leaves us completely in the dark on the energy front. E = Mc 2 is, by the way, merely a formula derivable from cl assical pre-Einstein electrodynamics and representing the fact that every individual electric charge comprising a body's ma ss contributes to the inertial property of that mass by resisting acceleration in just such a way as to preclude loss of its intrinsic electric energy by radiation. In short, every elementary component of the universe resists change of motion in an effort to conserve energy. Einstein did not understand the real nature of gravitation, meaning its essential electrodynamic connection, nor did he ever conquer the mystery of inertia. The question of primary concern in this Report centres on 'ma gnetism'. Here, even though you, the reader, might think that scientis ts understand magnetism, the sad truth is that the phenomenon of magnetic induction which was discovered by Michael Fa raday, and which is at the heart of the whole of electrical power engineering, is not understood by the 'experts'. The simple question of how the energy we feed into a magnetised solenoid is stored by that process has no adequate answer, at least in the standard teaching curriculum of acad emic establishments. Yet the answer to this question is crucial to th e research to be described in this Report. So, I begin by making a statement about the energy involved in magnetic induction and I challenge any scientist to refute what I say. When an electric current is supplied to a solenoid the energy stored by induction, which is a mutual action set up between between numerous electric charge s in motion, is dissipated into the thermal background of the aether itself. However, the action of that current in the solenoid is to deploy the motion of some of the aether elect ricity that constitutes that thermal vacuum background in such a way that an opposing magnetic reaction is establishe d inside that solenoid. When the current is switched off it is as if this magnetic system is then a transformer with th at reacting vacuum field becoming, in effect, a primary winding and the solenoid itself becoming the secondary winding. Energy is then fed back to the solenoid drawing on the thermodynamic state of the aether, which is left in a cooler conditi on, until, by a process of thermal equilibr ium, energy commensurate with that originally dispersed migrates back thr ough the aether to restore the status quo. The reader should not think of this as a tran sformer action depending upon alternating current effects. It is an action that applies also with d.c and, of course, with el ectromagnets and permanent magnets, where the atomic electron activity that pol arises the magnet is that of atomic solenoidal current effects. There is no question that this is a correct desc ription of the phenomenon of induction. We see here an action by which the aether has the ability to tr ansfer its energy to matte r. Magnetism provides the means for tapping into the vast sea of energy that fills space. However, the 'temperature' of that aether is not something we can measure by a thermometer, though one can sense it indirectly by its spectral effect on the radiation background. The experimental work to be de scribed has been founded on the aut hor's insight into the physics of magnetic induction as outlined in his book MODERN AETHER SCIENCE (see particularly pp. 113- 124). If the reader prefers instead to be guided by or thodox textbook teaching, which is different, then a word of caution is appropriate. Th ere are many excellent textbooks a nd they will tell you about the laws of Faraday and Lenz. Not all will be 'truthful' in the sense that they will tell you that scientists lack knowledge in this field. The book that stands out in my mind as a very readable text is that entitled 'THE NATURE OF PHYSICS' by Peter J. Brancazio (City University of New York); p ublisher Macmillan Publishin g Co, Inc., New York. On p a g e 328 one reads: Pa g e 3 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"At the present time there is no real understanding of why charges are set in motion by a changing magnetic field. Thus electromagneti c induction must also be regarded as an unexplained law of nature.\" The reader will see that a choice has to be made. On the one hand, th ere are the steril e teachings that accompany acceptance of Einstein's theory. These er adicate belief in the r eality of an electrical energy-active medium in space that transports el ectromagnetic waves. On the other hand, we have the alternative of an aether that accommodates to our energy needs by storing inductive power in its abundant low temperature heat sink. If the reader seeks an independent way forward on the question of induction that reader could come to terms with the facts expressed, as recently as December 1993, in the Engineering Science and Education Journal issued by the In stitution of Electrical Engineers. The cover of this journal shows (a), as the past, the statue of Michael Faraday in the IEE's headquarter building in London, (b), as the p resent, two students who face an uncertain energy future and (c), as that future , an illustration of a lightning discharge set alongside one showing a ba ttery 'farm' of wind- power generators. The relevant article of reference is one on pp. 273-280 by John Carpenter entitled 'Understanding Electromagnetism'. Here are some quotes fr om Carpenter's article: \"A great many electrical engineers, when challenge d on such matters, confess to a considerable unease with their grasp of electromagnetic fundamentals.\" \"One of the most familiar 'consequences' of a ma gnetic field is the property of inductance...What do we mean by 'inductance'? We define it by the voltage which is caused by a ch ange in current, and 'explain' the voltage in terms of flux linkage, part of which represents the magnetisation (i.e. the electron spins). It is these spins, acting like the el ectromagnetic equivalent of little flywheels, which interact with the conduction charges in the wire, and increase inductance. That is, they increase the electromagnetic inertia of the conduction electrons. But, we account for the voltage by some rather mystical quantity, denoted B , in empty space, and this is nothing whatever to do with electron spins. We represent B by lines on a diagram, provided wi th arrow-heads, and argue that B is the 'cause' of inductance. The type of student who always makes a nuisance of himself (or herself) may ask 'what is meant by B ?' The student can be told to shut up, but the teacher may have been given pause for thought. Electromagnetic theory might be characteri sed over the last 100 years, as a progressive retreat from the idea of the aether as some form of 'medium' needed to convey the electromagnetic interactions.\" Such, indeed, is the sorry plight of education in electrical science, bear ing in mind that th at 'aether' is the fountain from which flows all the en ergy that we see in our universe. Even though Carpenter discusses the question of indu ctance in such a critical way, he does, in developing his own thesis about the nature of inductan ce, avoid bringing to bear that full-bodied aether that is essential to resolving the problem. He too gives way by falling into line with that spirit of retreat from the aether concept. The Carpenter interpretation depends upon cu rrent 'interactions' as between currents in matter, disregarding current flow in the aether itself. This is at the very heart of the problem. Does induction energy, the magnetic energy we know is stored when current flows in a coil, reside in the inertial motion of the electrons whic h carry that current or is it 'stored' in the aether in the sense that it is held captive at the seat of the action? We are all familiar with storing money in a bank. Th at money we deposit is not kept in a box waiting for us to come back and withdraw the same mone y. Once deposited that money dissipates into a sea of action that is pooled and spent, just as en ergy dissipated as heat sp reads itself through space. Banks rel y on e q uilibrium which means a return on investment, an inflow balancin g an outflow and Pa g e 4 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"compensating for what is spent. We get our mone y back because the bank has kept a record which 'polarises' the bank's money 'field' in our favour. That record is somethi ng left in that bank, that is not the actual money we deposited, but which can be tr iggered to release money to us from the limited p art of the money pool kept by that bank. Inducta nce is a property by which energy transactions occur in an aether, replicating, in effect, the way in which money transactions occur in a bank. Understanding how the aether 'record' registers an energy transacti on is the challenging question and, if we can understand this, with our energy future in mind, we might unlock Nature's energy secret and then be seen to be, as they say, 'laughing all the way to the bank'! Whil st students, therefore, engage in the mysteries of understanding B and not then understanding how energy is stored by inductance, the task of harnessing inductance to pr ovide an entry route for tapping energy from that aether is one warranting our attention in this Report. I must now assume that the reader is ready to accept that magnetic inductance may have some important energy secrets to disclose and now trust that we can move directly to the experimental evidence without the reader feeli ng that in talking about 'aether' I am leading that person along a blind alley. 'Over-Unity' Power Generation A brief word is necessary on the theme of 'over-unity '. Readers will have seen this expression used above in connection with the fine -structure constant. This is a fundamental dimensionless physical constant as used by atomic physicists. In that 'over- unity' context it refers to the version of in its reciprocal form 1/, a quant ity that is slightly greater than 137. In dealing with atomic situations and spectral analysis, the 'below-uni ty' form for which is 0.007297 is more familiar to physicists. This digression does have a connect ion with aether energy, as the reader may see by referring to this author's contribution en titled 'The First Law of Thermodynami cs', which has appeared at pp. 340- 342 in the November 1993 issue of the U.K. Institut e of Physics Journal 'Physics Education' (See Appendix A to this Report). The expression 'over-unity' has come into general usage by researchers interested in 'free energy'. For a device to be said to operate 'over-unity' it s power input (usually electrical) must be exceeded by the power output, whether the latter is el ectrical or mechan ical or thermal. This reference to 'thermal' should not be confused with the 'heat pump', by thinking that conventional heat pumps operate with 'over-unity' performance. It may be that one joule of electrical energy can transfer 10 joules of room heat from a lower to a hi gher temperature, but that is not an 11 to 1 'over- unity' performance since the true input then is 11 j oules and the output is also 11 joules. The reverse Carnot efficiency factor of mer it or 'coefficient of performan ce' applies to such a process. By 'over-unity' in this report what is meant is the output of more useful energy than is supplied as useful energy input. In this context, those 11 joules of heat output are not as 'useful' as that 1 joule of electrical input and so the heat pump is not an ' over-unity' device. If, however, we run a device or a machine and it produces an excess of electrical out put or an excess of heat at a temperature so elevated in relation to input heat that the Carnot criteria ar e surpassed, then we have 'over-unity' p erformance. Our energy future is secured once we have the technology for this latter kind of operation. These Reports are being written because that technology is now in sight and there are, indeed, several alternative routes to that objec tive, all warranting our attention. There are versions of the motor develo p ed b y Robert G. Adams of New Zealand, which have alread y Pa g e 5 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"been demonstrated in 'over-unity' operation, measured strictly in electrical i nput and electrical output terms. The Nexus magazine publis hed in Australia has pioneered the news on the Adams machine and the Editorial in their January 1994 issue said that in 1993, since the Adams story had appeared: \"Nexus has been contacted by hundreds and hundreds of people from all over the world, and, yes, quite a lot of people have now successfully dupl icated the device based on the information we p ublished. In other words, there are now quite a few small-scale free energy machines running successfully out there, in the process of being made in to large-scale devices. If you have shares in oil companies - get ready to sell soon!\" The Adams machine will be discussed briefly in a section of this Report and in much greater detail in a later Report in this series. Howeve r, at the request of Robert Adam s, and in order to deal with a troublesome question that has emerge d, I need to comment here on clai ms of 'over-unity efficiency'. It was said in one early text about the Adams motor that it had a 270% efficiency and 700% was mentioned in a recent magazine report. The question posed concerns proof of such cl aims by evidence not relying on calculated interpretation of current and volta ge measurements. The crucial and usual question is whether the output from such a machine has been fed back as input so that the machine, once started, runs and delivers output power with no input, at least until some component or connection ruptures or otherwise fails. That would be a 'per petual motion machine' demonstration. With such performance it is then absurd to disc uss an efficiency measure because the efficiency becomes infinite. Therefore, the e xpression 'over-unity' has meaning as a classification rather than as a measure and the question is more related to the amount of 'feedback'. It is s uggested, therefore, that 'over-unity with 20% feedback' could be one wa y of saying that 4 units of useful output are generated from one unit of internal feedbac k. Such a machine or device made available commercially should not be rated by its 'efficiency' but rather by its net power generating capacity, its power rating being its ability to deliver net power continuously. It is also of relevance here to report that, on present experimental indications, yet to be fully researched, the Adams machines are delivering power which fluctuates wi th time of day. It is as if whatever is providing that coupling with the aethe r energy source is depe ndent upon the orientation of the device in relation to a spin ax is characteristic of that aether. This latter subject is rather special and it too will be covered by a later Report in this series. However, it is noted here that this 'discovery' wa s, in fact, anticipated by the author, based solely on aether theory, and became the subject of a prelimina ry patent filing lodged ev en before the news of the phenomenon was communi cated by Robert Adams. This is an appropriate point at wh ich to interject the statement that , whilst Robert Adams has become the focus of attention, and deservedly so, we owe it to NEXUS magazine for initiating the tidal wave of action that will soon deluge the electrical engi neering community. The wave of action will bring with it news of inventions, many of which ar e already covered by granted patents, but lie unappreciated amongst the dust-gathering informati on records of our technol ogical age. One very relevant example of this is th e U.S. Patent No. 5,227,702 (Inventor: Peter M. Nahirney), dated July 13, 1993, and drawn to my attention by Toby Grot z, the President of the recently formed INSTITUTE FOR NEW ENERGY, the professional soci ety which was created in Colorado in April 1993 when we had, amongst other developments, de bated the Nexus article publishing the design details of the Adams motor. This Report will now deal with experimental results showing how magnetism provides an aether energy access route. In this, our attention turns aw ay from 'free energy' motor developments, as such, and looks at stead y -state devices. U.S. Patent No. 4,687,947 ( Inventor: Melvin Cobb ) is relevant to Pa g e 6 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the theme developed next and warrants the reader's attention after digesting what is now to be described. The Power Converter An established technique used in d.c. power supplie s involves using electronic switching to chop an input signal into pulses at an audio frequency and feeding thos e pulses through a ferrite-cored magnetic inductor coupling to transform the voltage before merging the output pulses into a smooth regulated d.c. output. This process is highly ef ficient and the power systems are compact in construction and offer hi gh power rating in relation to bulk and weight. The question now addressed is that of exploiting such technology with a view to incorporating the secret that will allow us to tap aether energy so that we get more electrical power output than is supplied as input. The point to keep in mind is that the above-described technique will be assumed to be of a form which operates with a 'fl yback' coupling in that it uses the induc tance to store input energy in a time p eriod separated from that in which the inductance releases energy to the output. Also, what is to be described experimentally is not based on the use of a ferri te core but rather on a laminated sheet steel core, inasmuch as it is only the principle of operation that ne eds experimental demonstration for the purpose of this Report and it so happens that a convenient non-ferrite core assembly kit was available. We are not therefore, in this Report, going to get into the details of p roduct design and the related co sting of materials and specifi cation of a proposed product. Readers will appreciate that if we can gain some 'free energy' each time we drive a magnetic core through its magnetization cycle, the faster we can do that, the more energy we gain. The ferrite core p ermits higher frequency operation and, based on use in existing variable vol tage regulated power supplies, there is good reason to expect that what is described below, and which works for laminated steel cores, will be eventually implemented in ferrite-cored sy stems as a prefe rred product form. The following disclosure is also mo re concerned with the structural form of the magnetic core and its function energy-wise rather than the detailed wa y in which magnetizing coils are wired into an electronic control circuit. There are many variants and design po ssibilities for the latter, and such design does not pose unusual problems, but the core design depends upon the se cret of that energy- tapping function and that does involve us in some new physics. I also rema rk that there are many who have wondered about the effectiveness and indeed the purpose of using bifilar-wound coils, with currents in the respective portions of the winding that merely cancel each other electromagnetically. The word 'flyback' used above bears upon this question and I leave the reader to p onder on that as a puzzle that I shall answer in a subsequent report. To proceed, we need first a brief lesson in simple ferromagnetism as it a pplies to a magnetic core having an air gap. Ferromagnetism Ferromagnetism is Nature's way of giving us something for nothing in energy terms. Build a solenoid which has a non-ferromagnetic core and measure the inductance energy which has to be supplied in a.c. current and a.c. voltage terms and then, with the same voltag e, see what magnetizing current is needed if the core is re p laced b y one that is ferroma g netic, sa y soft iron. For the same Pa g e 7 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"voltage, that magnetizing current is proportional to power in reactance terms and so to the energy stored at times of maximum current. With the ferromagnetic core present we need far le ss current to secure the same voltage. The reason for this is that the ferromagnetic core itself is making up the energy difference by virtue of the 'perpetual motion' of those atomic electrons in th e iron that endow the core with its ferromagnetic state. N ow ask how a power transformer works. We have two coils on an iron core. The object is to put energy into one coil and take energy from the other. By using the iron core we find that we can transfer energy between the two coils using a fa r smaller magnetizing curren t than would otherwise be needed. That current flowing in a copper coil means a loss owing to the resistivity of the copper and so, to reduce weight and cost, and assure effi cient operation with minimal loss, one really must have a ferromagnetic core li nking the two coils to assure minimal magnetizing current. N ow, rather than being satisfied that we know how a power transformer works and so have little to learn from that technology, let us ask how that tran sformer works if the two coils are separated at a distance along the length of a core or are on different sides of a squa re core, as depicted in Fig. 1. We find that, somehow, that iron core has the abi lity to carry energy from A to B. Without the iron core very little of the energy supplied to A would be recoverable from B. N ow, it is a fact connected with th e nature of ferromagne tism that, if one could see inside the iron looking at microscopic sections, the iron would everywhere be seen to be fully magnetized to saturation. Inside each crystal ther e are what are termed 'magnetic domains' in which the magnetism is directed along one of the three mutually orthogonal crystal axes each of which is an 'easy axis of magnetization'. The intrinsic miniature solenoids th at represent the magnetic state of such domains each carry the maximum equivalent current associ ated with the related atomic electron motion and the normal process of magn etizing the iron macroscopically is one of causing these solenoids to reverse direction. Fig. 1 It needs very little externally applied magnetizing current to promote the reversal of magnetism in a magnetic domain. Essentially such curr ent as is needed is used to overcome the back reaction effects of non-magnetic inclusions in the iron or of the thin boundary wall regions separating domains or any air gaps built into the core as a whole. These 180 o reversals occur with very little work being done and, as the level of overall magnetization builds up owing to overall domain ma gnetism becoming predomin antly in one general direction, so one approaches the stage where the magnetism e xploits the possibility of a 90 o transition between 'easy axes of magnetization'. This needs a stronger magnetizing influence. Thereafter, from about 70% of saturation onwards, an y further increase in polarization has to involve a very demanding action where the dom ain 'solenoids' are literally forced to turn to come closer into line. However, in this process the externally applie d current finds itself assi sted by the mutual action of the domain solenoidal eff ects and this is now a sta g e where the underl y in g ener gy which feeds the Pa g e 8 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"motion of those electrons is contributing very s ubstantial amounts of energy to bring about that increased state of magnetism. Saturation occurs only when all the solenoidal effects intrinsic to the domains are forced into a common direction and each, like a spring unde r stress, has a wi ll to revert to a position along one of the 'easy axes of magnetizat ion', but is held in place only by that externally applied current. N ow, when this is summed up, we see that, provided the level of magnetization in an iron core with no air gaps is moderate, there is very little exte rnal energy needed to control the magnetic flux which is present in the core. Therefore, a primary coil at A can assert its influen ce in transferring magnetic action to a secondary coil B without too much of its magnetizing force bei ng used to overcome the back reaction of those non-ferroma gnetic inclusions and domain boundary walls. It is better if the p rimary winding and secondary wind ing are wound around each other, me aning that A is at B or vice versa. However, 'better' in this sense means better from the viewpoint of av oiding the reaction that goes with harnessing the intrinsic power action of the core. In our 'free energy' pursuit that is not the 'better' course, since it me ans that we have deliberately avoided th e source of that 'free energy'. It is only by making the inductive coupling process difficul t so that the intrinsic ferromagnetism of the iron core has to work harder in its 'flyback' role that one can tap into it s 'free energy' potential. To proceed further, we now need to ask how an ai r gap in a core interferes with the ability of a magnetic core to carry the magnetic flux. Air Gap Reaction Effects Suppose (Fig. 2) that a magnetic core has a quite la rge cross-section in rela tion to its loop length but a very small width of air gap in the vicinity of B, say 0.1% that of the core length. One would think that all this would mean, as a lo ss of 0.1% of the iron present, is that the magnetic flux set up by a given current excitation in a coil at A would be reduced by 0.1%. Fig. 2 This is not the case. Indeed, by taking that 0.1% of the iron away, even for iron which is very poor in terms of its magnetic properties, meaning it does not have large crystals and does have impurity inclusions, it can easily be that the ma gnetic flux is halved in this situation. It seems obvious, on reflection, that this is not just a question of actions occurr ing in that iron core. I f the magnetism developed by that iron, thanks to a current in coil A, sees nothing to resist it in that air gap, then it should have no difficul ty traversing that air gap, especially as it is has still 99.9% of its original strength. Common sense tells one that the air gap is extremel y active in its own right, as if an enormous current is flowing in an imaginary vacuum coil at B directed in opposition to the influence of the coil at A. The vacuum devoid of aether cannot, however , be something in which current can be said to flow, especially a d.c. current - or can it? The wa y in which to decide this is to re p licate that flow of aether current at B b y tests involvin g a Pa g e 9 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"coil placed at B, very close to th at air gap, and see what is invol ved in neutralizing the magnetic reaction effect in the gap. When this is done, the simple truth is that we di scover that there is an asymmetry in the following sense. We establish a state with a given magnet flux traversing that air ga p, regarding coil A as p rimary and see what current is needed in A to se t up the flux with no current in identical coil B. Then with coil B as primary acting to set up the same magnetic flux across th e air gap in the same direction we find what current is needed for this pur pose. It is found that less current is needed in B than was originally needed in A. N ow look at this from the viewpoint of inductance energy storage. To power a coil at A we need more inductance energy input than is needed by one at B to achieve in the air gap the same magnetic condition. What accounts fo r this discrepancy? The answer is that for both conditi ons there is actually a current flow in the aether at the air gap, which current is virtually equal a nd opposite to that in coil B. Th erefore the aether reaction current and the current in coil B complement one another in terms of their role in setting up a store of inductive energy. It needs very li ttle discrepancy between the two currents to stimulate the magnetic p olarization in the continuity of the iron core a nd so, what is represented by this situation is a magnetic flux condition in the air gap with no l eakage flux around that gap. Virtually all the energy supplied to coil B is stored in that air gap. With coil A excitation and no power on coil B, a greater input of energy is demanded by the inductance of the system, because the energy stat e represented by the air gap proper is supplemented by that of flux leakage, as depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 However, the question at issue here is how the energy gets from coil A to the gap, given that it needs very little action to influence, either create or suppress, the magnetic polar ization in the iron. If all the action is by virtue of those 180 o or 90 o domain transitions any reacti on field from the gap region would preclude a change in magnetic flux when coil A is energized. This poses no problem for the coil B excitation because there is nothing around the iron circuit path to resist a change in magnetic flux, but it is a ma jor problem if the coil A excitation has to work against an air gap in a remote section of the core. The answer lies in the need to set up an internal magnetic field inside the body of the core between A and B and this means that there has to be at least some domain flux rotation, necessitated by the direct action of the coil A current in urging fl ux rotation by domains which do not have their host crystals with easy axes of magneti zation orientated along the coil axis. Once this scenario develops we are entering the realm of 'free energy' and so it is of interest now to report an experiment which involves an accounting of an energy balance sheet. We shall see that we need to bring into account some energy from that mystery sour ce we have calle d 'the aether'.

All one needs, in addition to a voltmeter or oscill oscope, an ammeter, and a variable voltage 50 Hz or 60 Hz power supply is a standa rd inexpensive transformer assemb ly kit, some cardboard and a little wire. A suitable 100 VA tran sformer kit is one available, as distributed in U.K., from RS Components U.K. (P.O. Box 99, Corby, Northants NN17 9RS). Stock Ref. No. 207-734. There will be a corresponding source of supply available from the local distri buters in many other countries. The transformer has an E-shaped core and a bridging yoke as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 The experiment involves assembling th e kit several times, using a diff erent number of card layers to form an 'air gap' or rather a 'pole gap' of 10 different widths, ranging from 0 to 9 card thicknesses. I used card of 0.25 mm thickness. The object of the experiment is to compare the re luctance energy or inductance energy stored in the air gap at moments of maximum flux density with the integrated reactive volt-amp measure of energy input to the magnetizing wi nding over a quarter cycle period. Standard teaching requires that the input energy represented by that volt- amp-time measure is necessarily greater than the energy stored in that gap. The latter is a measure of the mechanical work p otential attributable to the mutual attraction of th e magnetic poles, as available if they were allowed to move to close the gap. The wire is used to wind a search coil or secondary on a part of the transformer core adjacent to the gap where it can provide a measure, given some flux leakage, of the actual magnetic flux traversing the pole gap. One can, as a physics exercise (see energy balance analysis below), calculat e the pole gap energy in terms of the flux density, area and width of the gap. One can also calculate the reactance input energy for the quarter cycle over 1/200 second at 50 Hz or 1/240 second at 60 Hz and compare the two. That is straightforward physics, but the beauty of this experiment is that no such calculations are needed. For each of the several tests one measures the curre nt supplied to the magnetizing coil, which is the standard primary coil supplied with the kit. The cu rrent capacity of the coil is the limiting factor on the flux density so one is obliged with this test apparatus to operate well below the knee of the B-H curve. This current is adjusted by the variable a.c. voltage supply so that th e same voltage is induced in the search coil for each test.

Therefor e we have two variables. One is the input current and the other is the number of card thicknesses defining gap widt h. We plot a graph of current against gap width (Fig. 5) using the data in Table I. Fig. 5 If we input more energy than is needed to set up the mechanical potential energy of the gap then the p lot of current versus that number of card thicknesse s will show an upward curve, inasmuch as there will be progressively increasing flux leakage wi th increasing gap width. However, assuming (a) energy conservation, (b) no loss and (c) no flux leak age, by our standard physics principles, we expect no discrepancy and that mean s a straight line relationship. If there is flux leakage, increasing with gap wi dth, but still no energy loss, the inductance energy stored by that leakage will demand more current as input and so the cu rrent curve observed will climb away from the ideal linear relationship. That is, unless the 'free energy' source is so overwhelming in its power that it can pull that curve down below the linear norm. What one finds, in fact, is that, even in spite of leakage effects, the relationship between current and the gap width curves down well below that linear re lationship. This means that, with increasing gap width, the reluctance energy in the gap becomes pr ogressively greater, indeed far greater, than the energy supplied as input. This evidences a clear and direct breach of the law of energy conservation unless we can embrace the concept that the ferromagnetic core has a way of borrowing energy from a source not contemplated by our textbook teachings.

We can then draw the straight line expressing the theoretical reluctance energy as a function of curr ent versus card thickness in Fig. 5. I calibrated with 3 card thicknesses and found that a primary voltage 76.9 V gave a search coil induced voltage which had an arbitrary amplitude su ited to a chosen grid range on the oscilloscope screen. The above current readings were plotted by using the same test amplitude to set the input voltage for all card thicknesses. The voltage signal sensed in the series-connected co ils B, each of 20 turns, shown in Fig. 4, had a p eak value of 1.5 V for this test. N ote that the effect of an air gap is to cause the inductance of the primary winding A to become linear in the sense that the non-linear distortion by signal ha rmonic components often found when the hysteresis of the iron governs the core respons e is virtually obscured by the dominant air gap reluctance effect. This means that we can reasona bly assume a sinusoidal va riation of voltage and current. It is also feasible to ignore the phase sh ift which occurs owing to resistance in the primary winding, at least for the immediate purpose of proving that there is a very substantial 'free energy' anomaly. This can be justified by keeping track of the proportionality of the relationship between p rimary and search coil turns ratio in relation to voltage induced and voltage supplied. In any event the ohmic resistance effects can be allowed for in th e analysis since primary current is measured and the primary resistance is known (17 ohms). Such cons iderations do not affect the substance of the analysis presented below. The inductance energy for a cu rrent I is expressed as LI 2 /2 which, becomes LI 2 if I is the root mean square current value and the inductance energy is that at moments of peak current strength. We therefore shall calculate the energy in the air gap for the flux density B max corresponding to a sinusoidal a.c. current I. Note th at the root mean squa re value of the voltage V applied to the magnetizing winding is represented by L Ï I so that the inductance energy supplied to the gap at peak current times is VI/ Ï , where Ï is the angular velocity corr esponding to the power frequency. In the reported test the central core area or total cross-section sensed by the combined search coils was 8 sq. cm. but, owing to the flux return, the tota l pole face is 16 sq. cm. Each 20-turn search coil embraced a 4 sq. cm. cross-sect ion. The magnetizing winding specif ication was rated at 240 volts and 3.7 winding turns per volt. The magnetic flux density needed to produce the 76.9 V is, therefore, about one third of the normal opera tional flux density of the transformer. At 50Hz this corresponds to a maximum flux density of 0.4875 tesl a or webers per square meter. However, this is the flux density in the part of the core at the primary winding location. With that three card thickness air gap of so me 0.75 mm there is a substantial leakage of flux not reaching the p ole faces and so traversing the ga ps. We know this because the cen tral core flux density at its maximum amplitude is that giving a 1.5 V signal in 40 turns embracing half the 8 sq. cm. area of that central core. This, at 50 Hz, is 0.2985 tesla. Bear in mind that this 0.2985 tesla is the flux dens ity that governs the energy stored between the pole faces across a 16 sq. cm. or 0.0016 s q. m. cross-section and it appl ies over the full current range shown in Fig. 5. Note further that this flux will be non-uniform across th e area of the pole faces, which means that the stress energy we calculate as the mechanical potent ial of that gap will underestimate substantially the tr ue energy potential should we rely on that 0.2985 tesla as being uniform. Our energy balance sheet must now take as, energy input, the quantity VI/ Ï and decide how much of this inductance energy input is stored in the le akage flux zone, where the flux traverses long paths through air, to bridge the legs of the E-shaped core, and how much of this inductance energy goes directl y into the small-width g a p between the p ole faces where it can be 'seen' as p art of that 0.2985 Pa g e 13 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"tesla field. Our calculation will be based on unit card thic kness of 0.25 mm. The card has a permeability Î¼ which is virtually that of the vacuum, namely 4x10 -7 H/m. B is 0.2985 tesla. The energy density is B 2 /2Î¼ and so the total energy the gap betwee n the pole faces is then 0.0016x0.00025 times this energy density. This works out at 0.01418 J on a per card thickness basis. If there are N card layers in the test giving the data in Fig. 5 so we have stored inductance energy in the pole gaps given by (0.01418)N joules at instants when the flux density peaks at the level set by the tests. In fact, the energy stored and available for doing mechanical work is much greater than this, because the flux density has to be non-uniform and the root mean square value needed for energy conversion is so much larger than the mean value. N ow, what energy have we supplied? The en ergy supplied is VI / Ï , where I is the primary current and V is that portion of the primary back EMF whic h can be said to relate to magnetic flux linking the search coil. The rms primary voltage that corresponds to that 1.5 V maximum is 76.9 V and, for 5O Hz, Ï as the angular frequency of the power supply, is 314 rad/s. There is analogy between EMF in a resistive circuit and the effects of primary current in producing magnetomotive force (MMF) in a magnetic circuit. The magnetic flux is analogous to electric cu rrent and what we term 'reluctance' substitutes for resistance. By this analogy, our inductance ener gy input is apportioned to the pole gap region, as if the supply current develops the magnetomotive force which sees a reluctance component that allows a peak flux density of 0.2985 tesla, wher eas 76.9 V corresponds to 0.4875 tesla. Therefore, 47.1 V is a measure of V that applies to the primary current in determining reluctance energy fed to the pole gaps. This energy quantity is (47.1)I/ or, for 50 Hz and Ï as 2(50), (0.1499)I J. This applies to a test with three card thicknesses and the ener gy then known to exist in the pol e gaps is (0.01418)N J, where N is 3. Therefore, the corresponding value of I fo r a perfectly balanced energy account, is I = 3 (0.01418)/(0.1499) A or 284 mA. Table I shows that the current measured was, in fact, 279 mA. Accordingly, in choosing the pole gap width of 0.75 mm or three card layers, we have fortuitously demonstrated a calculation that applies at the departure threshol d where the energy does, in fact, balance. The point now of relevance is that , in progressing in the Fig. 5 tests to values of N above 3, the pole gap energy component increases line arly, whereas the input energy redu ces in relative terms. With N of 9 the primary input has increased to 100 V and the primary current is 538 mA, but the component supplying the pole gap region is st ill that 47.1 V. In effect, theref ore, the input power feeding the p ole gaps has doubled but the energy stored in the gap has trebled. The downward curve in Fig. 5 tells us that, if we ca use the magnetic circuit to require more MMF, so the ferromagnetism of the core becomes subject mo re and more to domain flux rotation and then it sheds energy and makes it available as a form of inductance energy we can tap mechanically by closing the pole gaps. We do, therefore, have here, in this experiment , the means for probing the 'free energy' resource afforded by ferromagnetism.

However, that is too taxing a concept for physics teachers to absorb in view of its startling technologi cal implications, so I will end by simply challenging readers to do this experiment and to try to reconcile what they find with what is currently taught about energy conservation principles. I add that, for those who lack the pioneering sp irit and prefer to rely on the authoritative work of others, it is appropriate to refe r to Fig. 113 at p. 173 in the 'Principles of Electromagnetism', 3rd Edition, Oxford, Cl arendon Press 1959 by Cambridge Professor E.B. Moullin. Such an experiment is there reported and for a 7mm gap in a rectangular core 4 times larger in linear scale than the one I used, a nd so corresponding to my 7 card thicknesses, the data presented show that th e reluctance gap energy is then twice that supplied as inductance energy. However, Moullin kept the applied voltage constant and did not use a separate search coil. Professo r Moullin was not averse to the 'aether' concept but, in discussing leakage flux effect s, he missed the full significance of his experiment. Only a discerning reader, havi ng reason to suspect th e intruding hand of something akin to the Maxwell Demon, would have cause to give special weight to Moullin's statement: \"We ha ve seen reasons for supposing the leakage flux does not change very much with gap width\". I only became such a 'discerning reader' af ter nearly 30 years possession of this book, when I heard of 'crank' claims that cert ain forms of homemade switched reluctance motor, which, when the magnetization was switched on only for a period before pole closure, could deliver more power output th an is absorbed as power input. It was no easy task to turn one's formal education around. I therefore urge readers to pay attention and repeat the experiment I describe. My earlier communications on 'The Law of Perpet ual Motion' and 'The First Law of Thermodynamics' were not based on ignorance or philosophy but were intended to pave the way forward to something of major im portance now developing on the alternative energy scene. This 'energy from magnetism' theme, as it evolves into technology, need not take those who teach physics by surprise, es pecially when so simple an experiment can put one's physics education back on track.\" ___________ Although my comments on the possibility of 'Perpe tual Motion' and energy conservation as needing an aether to avoid breach of 'The First Law of Thermodynamics' were accepted and published in the July and November issues of Physics Education, my 'Letter to the Editor' entitled 'Mystery Energy Source' was rejected by the 'peer review' process. The reasons given in the referee report may interest the reader: \"Aspden presents his results as evidence of a fundamental flaw in the accepted theories of physical phenomena. These have proved so widely and exactly verifiable that something more than a few simple tests is need ed to shake one's faith. It is necessary to show that no reasonable theory will account for the observations, and nothing like enough has been done to justify his am bitious conclusions.

Until such tests have been made it would be mischievous to publish his letter.\" The implication of this is that I must be wrong and that my measur ements are subject to question. I am told that I must show that no reasonable theory will account for the observations, even though I quoted the Oxford, Clarendon Press tr eatise of Professor Moul lin and that text s hows that the nearest one can come to explanation by accepted theory is not satisfactory. Moullin did extend his tests to removing the yoke! My answer, therefore, as a physicist, is that I have made my contribution to the world of learning and have not been heeded and so, my task now is to concentrate as an engineer and develop the technology of this 'free energy' opp ortunity, leaving the physicist to the comfort of an erroneous and stagnant, but 'acceptable' world. I believe that the 'free energy' e xperiment I have described above wi ll eventually become a standard experiment which will be used to show future generations that the ferromagnet is a catalyst which gives us access to a new and plentiful source of energy by tapping into the vacuum energy source that determines the Planck action quantum. Magnetic Leakage Flux and the Adams Motor It is not intended that this Re port should provide any details about the design of the Adams motor, but some comments are necessary. Firstly, it was said in connection with the transf ormer experiment already described that, to get ferromagnetism to supply that 'free energy', we had to weaken the coup ling between the primary winding and the part of the core in the vicinity of the pole gap. Secondly, it was said that our e xperiment was limited in the flux density that could be generated across the pole gap, because the 100 VA transforme r kit only allowed primar y magnetizing currents that could sustain 0.3 tesla and this meant opera tion well down on the B-H curve, where the 'free energy' was not forthcoming in great measure. Both of these factors are crucial to the successful design of an Adams motor. The latter problem is overcome by using permanent magnets to replace th e action of the primary winding and the former feature is built into the Adams prototype machin es by an open core soft iron stator design, with control windings mounted on the stat or pole members near the pole gap. The motor operates with 'over-uni ty' performance, showing that the 'mystery energy source' is contributing to the pole gap energy a nd much of that energy is then used to provide output power by being prevented from reentry to the fe rromagnetism of the permanent magnets. The underlying concept is to operate the motor in a way which transfers intrinsic ferromagnetic p ower to the gap between the pole f aces, where it is stored by inductance and held for 'flyback' return when output coils are switched into circuit after pole closure, but in adva nce of pole separation. The pole gap and leakage flux around that gap are key to the Adams motor operation and it is therefore appropriate to comment on that remark by Professor Moullin: \"We have seen reasons for supposing the leakage flux does not ch ange very much with gap width\". A small gap in a magnetic circuit can have an enor mous effect on reducing th e magnetic flux in that circuit. It should, by accepted theory, not produce any significant amount of flux leakage, in the sense that flux escapes from the circuit. Yet, our experiments suggest otherwise, depending upon the core confi g uration used.

Tha gap adds an enormous capacity for storing inductance energy using a winding on that core and yet the inductance is decreased, not increased. The ferrom agnet sets a limit on flux density but the gap allows the core to accept a much greater magnetiz ing current at that limi t of flux density. The LI 2 /2 energy is related to a flux density proportional to LI and so energy capacity increases linearly with current I, whereas, if L decreases, the energy can increase for the same LI value. Fig. 6 The energy stored in that gap is represented by a ve ry powerful reacting current flow in the aether in the gap. This current is powered by the aether ener gy sea. It is a kind of diamagnetic thermodynamic reaction state polarised by the presence of the primar y magnetization of the ma in iron core. This is not a flux leakage phenomenon but one by which th e composite magnetic flux, that from the main core and the circulating flux induced locally ar ound the aether current reaction, is effective in appearing as a diversionary agency. The main core flux is partially di verted so as to jump through air external to the main core path whilst the re mainder crosses directly between the pole faces. N ow, of course, this reacting aether current flow is what serves in the Adams motor as the means contributing to the weakening of th e direct attractive pull between the two core sections, whilst at the same time augmenting the 'flyback ' action and serving to deliver energy should the output be taken off electrically rather than mechanically. The point made here is that Profe ssor Moullin had drawn attention to the curious fact that a small air gap in a ferromagnetic ring core could drastically affect the flux traversi ng the gap and could cause significant flux leakage around that air gap, but ye t by the standard principl es of electromagnetism that he knew so well, that should not be. The so lution to his problem was unknown to him when he wrote the referenced book in its third edition in 1954, but it was discovered by this author shortly after graduating Ph.D. in that very year for re search on ferromagnetic reaction currents, research conducted in Professor Moullin's laboratories. There is what the author term s a 'half-field' reaction effect set up inside metal or in ai r gaps or in vacuo when magnetic fi elds are present. This is the way the aether reacts at the equilibr ium interface between aether and matt er in the energy exchange that we are here discussing. Physics that does not countenance the 'aether' is phys ics that has turned its back on the sea of energy in that aether. An electrical engineer of the stat ure of Professor Moullin had to deal in unsolved mysteries in energy technology beca use his professorial associat es disciplined in physics and mathematics had created a climate of opinion that would not allow aether science to develop. It was, of course, such frustrat ion that caused this author to write and publish \"MODERN AETHER SCIENCE\" in 1972. And it is now, following decades of frustration, that tec hnology is ready to take us forward on the track of ferromagnetism to a world which affords access to that energy in the aether. At this stage, and to underline the importance of the 'half-field' reaction theme, the author could even go further back in years and draw attention to his first printed publication that discloses the way in which the vacuum reacts to store a magneti c field. Chapter 9 of 'THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION' dated 22 November 1959 discusses the gyromagnetic ratio of th e aether itself and explains the anomalous factor 2 found in gyrom agnetic phenomena. The reaction energy of the ma g netic field in vacuo is the thermal kinetic ener gy stored b y the aether.

It has been realised for some time si nce the first prototype was demonstr ated that there had to be some new physical principles at work in this technology, or at least a very special application of existing p hysical principles that had come about fort uitously and had not been fully understood. The 'second' experiment which I wi ll now discuss is one performed expressly with the object of a diagnostic testing of a possible prin ciple concerning the physics of that thermoelectric device. In the event it has revealed a regenerative energy pro cess which, when developed and implemented in one of the forms originally contemplated in the granted patents, promises to be one we can classify as 'free energy' and ' over-unity' operation. Ferromagnetism provides the cat alyst for tapping thermodynamic ac tivity in the vacuum medium and generating useful electrical output from the heat input. In contrast, where we draw heat from a material source, a magnetic field, which need not be enhanced by ferromagnetism, can serve as the catalys t by which that heat is converted into useful electrical power. The well-known power generati ng technology involving this latter action is that of magnetohydrodynamics, where a hot ionised gas flows along a channel (x axis) a magnetic d.c. field acts transversely (y axis) and an electric potential supplying cu rrent is set up in the mutually orthogonal direction (z axis). The magnetic field defl ects the ions one way or the other in the z axis according to electric charge polar ity. The heat, as the kinetic energy of the ion motion, is thereby diverted to produce a voltage which supplies current output. A solid-state implementation of th is occurs in a steel lamination to set up a potential between its opposite surfaces (z axis), provided there is a temper ature differential in the plane of the lamination (x axis) and the lamination is magnetized in the othe r planar direction (y ax is). The electrons carry heat and in so doing, being ions in motion in a transv erse magnetic field, that intrinsic to the internal ferromagnetic state of the steel, they are deflected to set up that voltage potential between the opposite surfaces of the lamination. When current of an externally-connected circuit is allowed to flow in the z direction, the lamination cools as the EMF so generated deliv ers power. The advantage of using the steel lamination or nickel, as in the main prototype experiments, is that the strong intrinsic magnetic polarization of the domains in the metal avoids the need to provide externally-powered magne tizing windings. Thus one witnesses a very efficient techni que of refrigeration using a soli d-state technology, pr ovided, that is, that one can (a) assure that heat flow in the metal and (b) a transverse current flow that does not p rovide for a concomitant loss of heat in that transverse direction. As part of the research effort involved in this thermoelectric project, the author has experimented with a magnetic core comprising bimetallic laminati ons composed of steel and nickel, meaning steel film plated with a layer of nickel on one surfa ce. The principle of the experiment is to induce magnetization loss in the laminations which produ ces heat. The heat is conducted away by flow confined within the laminations. A transverse curr ent flow exists near both edges of each lamination, being that of the circulating eddy -currents associated with the i nduction. That z-axis flow at the edges, plus the y-axis effect of the intrinsic domain magnetism on the x-axis heat flow carried by electrons, combine to offer flow paths through domains which serve to set up a forward EMF augmenting that current flow. In effect, one can hope to set up a negative resistance which allows the device to become regenerative as heat input pr oduces electrical power, which, in turn, unless we can tap into it and take some away, will dissipate as ohmic heating in the central portions of the laminations.

It is as if the laminations themselves form the effective secondary winding. A 50 Hz or 60 Hz a.c. current is fed through a resistor connected in series with th e magnetizing winding (Fig. 7). The resistor feeds the X plates of an oscilloscope wi th a signal proportional to its poten tial drop, giving an oscilloscope trace measure of H. The secondary winding is c onnected as shown with the Y plates receiving a signal from a 2 Î¼F capacitor in series with the 100,000 ohm resistor. This provides a time integral of the time rate of change of the magnetic core flux density B and so the oscillosc ope indicates also the B measure. Fig. 7 For normal transformer operation this circuit will provide a normal representation of the B-H hysteresis loop, which develops into an ellipse as the eddy-currents increase (Fig. 8). However, suppose that there is something special about the laminations by wh ich the resistance of the eddy- current path becomes predominantly negative in one section owing to heat being converted into an EMF acting in a forward sense around that eddy-current path. Fig. 8 In this case, provided that action is strong e nough, the effective secondary winding provided by that eddy-current path can, conceivably, take over the action and become the primary power input source, energized by input heat. To feed power to the circuit including the resistor used to measure H , the induced EMF would need to derive from a B flux var y in g in anti p hase with H .

Fig. 9 It follows, therefore, that the re generative heat-to-electr icity conversion potential of the device under test is easily inspecte d, simply by examining the B-H loop as the current in the magnetizing winding is progressively increased. N ow this is exactly what was found to happen in preliminary tests on a tran sformer assembled with its main limbs comprising steel laminations plated wi th nickel. This means that there was here sight of a new technology by which bimetallic ferromagneti c laminations can serve to convert heat into electrical power. Before describing what was observed, by adopti ng the same text as was presented in my article 'Three Experiment s on Free Energy', I have to explain that, upon rebuilding the experiment using a more powerful current source aime d at driving the circuit to a higher power level, the staged trigger action of the flip between th e Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 B-H loop forms did not occur. Instead, the action was as if there was an enormous activity confined to the Fig. 9 state, characterized by a very wide elliptical form of loop and, on an alysis, showing that th e power energy action per cycle was extremely high in relation to what could otherwise represent magnetization loss. Note that with the earlier situation and the loop change fr om Fig. 8 to Fig. 9 as current excitation increased, one knew that there was regeneration. I now suspect that the test core, which origin ally exhibited bistable operation, has become conditioned by internal thermal activation, that ma y have resulted from coupling a capacitor to form a resonant load circuit, so as (this being speculation!) to become locked in its state which precludes Fig. 9 operation. In my urgency to complete this Report before re working the apparatus with new laminations, I shall leave this particular issue open for clarification in my next Report on this subject. I am bearing in mind that the power of the B-H loop and phase angle measurements show really enormous magnetization loss per cycle if the device is not acting regeneratively. There are certain other fascinating aspects linking with hitherto unexpl ained experimental phenomena which will be reported in due course, a nd which give good reason to interpret the action as regenerative. Special test rigs have now to be built to prove this beyond doubt by extracting that power as output, notwithstanding confinement to the Fig. 8 state, a nd here we have the leading evidence from the basic experiments on the prototype devices which used films of bi metallic coated polymer. They demonstrated regeneration of el ectricity from heat convincingl y by showing an electric motor running from the thermal effects of ice melting in a room temperat ure environment. The experiment now under discussion is part of a research progr amme aimed at improving and simplifying that technology whilst aiming to c onvert to power delivery ac companied by energy-balancing refrigeration action via a magnetic rather than a capacitative circuit coupling. ______________ The following text comprises para phrased sections quoted from 'Three Experi ments on Free Energy: \"At the mountain retreat where we had a pr ivate brainstorming session involving many of the s p eakers, I mentioned the thermoelectric p ro j ect in which I was involved and Pa g e 21 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"showed a video demonstrating the quite remarkable speed at which ice can form with very little electric power input and how electricity is rege nerated with high efficiency drawing on the energy of melting ice. That Colorado meeting was a landmark event in the history of new energy developments as it marks the beginning of an escalation which will lead to a bonanza on the energy front. In the intervening period, since we met in Colorado in April, I attended, in August, the 28th Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineer ing Conference in Atlanta, Georgia. I presented an update on the thermoelectric pr oject, emphasizing its m ode of operation as a very powerful solid-state technique of refrigeration avoi ding CFC pollution. That Atlanta conference lacked the exciteme nt of the Denver event, but it has opened doors that can help in onward progress. From a personal viewpoint I felt at a disadvantage in that I have, fo r the past five and more ye ars, been following the new energy movement from a theoretical standpoint. The 'jewel in the crown' that inspired me from a patent and business motivation view point was my interest as co-inventor in the thermoelectric technology that my asso ciate Scott Strachan was working on in Scotland. His work has been funded and my hope has been to see that venture become the revenue earner that could take the other energy research forward in a business sense. However, funded only by my pension income and savings, as we older 'free energy' enthusiasts usually are, I did find myself at the meeting in Atlanta, with no update technical input to report from Scott Strach an, and wondering why I was there with no recent personal hands-on experime ntal facts at my disposal. I ndeed, in talking to Patrick Bailey at that Atlanta meeting, I vowed not to attend another such conference unless I could report on my own experimental work. So, having exercised my professional skills and established a pate nt position on several energy inventions that I was unable to demons trate as working devices built by myself, I set to last month and began my experime ntal program with a very limited funding resource. I say this because I feel that some of your readers will wish to repeat the experiments I report below and I simply wish to stress that very little outlay is involved. My object is to demonstrate the scientific basis and technical feas ibility of three 'free energy' projects. I direct my comments at those who profess to pass on knowledge to future generations. I am not here going to explain how what is described can be implemented in a practical machine. That will follow later when I progress to that stage. I know what I say has a practical end product because my sole objective is to bridge a knowledge gap to cover the true science lyi ng in that zone betw een orthodox doctrinaire belief and the working 'free energy' machine. The target objective for the first of my three basic experiments is: The curious fact that our thermoelectric refr igeration device is built with an inherent functional symmetry and yet it always cool s on its exposed test heat sink surface, it being noted that the electrical operating unit is mounted on the same panel that constitutes the second heat si nk surface. The latter gets hot as the former cools, but, unless Scott Strachan builds a version that se parates the electrical operating unit from the second heat sink we shall have to await the clear expe rimental evidence that, in truth, both surfaces are cooling as the device delivers electrical power!

It defies the second law of ther modynamics, but that should not deter a pioneer who has in his possession the device mentioned above. The object of the experiment is to test a suspicion that current circulation within a bimetallic lamination can, under certain circumst ances, result in cooling for current flow across the thickness of the lamination. The experiment acknowledges that such cooling would produce an EMF and put electrical power into increasing the current flow in the plane of the lamination, unless deflected from the lamination, transverse to its width. This means extra heating and anomalous loss augmenting the eddy-current loss, but such an anomaly is direct evidence of that underlying cooling and el ectrical generation. The prototype devices all used thin film bime tallic layers of aluminium and nickel and involved that transverse 'deflection'. The 'cir cumstances' stated are that the lamination includes a ferromagnetic layer of thickness le ss than the 100 micron dimension, the size of a magnetic domain formed within th e larger crystals of the material. In the subject experiment, there was no tran sverse deflection but the other condition was met. Commercially available steel foil (known in the trade as 'shim steel') of 2 thousandths of an inch in thickness was obtai ned and an electroplating firm was asked to coat one face with nickel us ing an electroless plating pro cess. The nickel coating was 0.7 thousandths of an inch in thickness. It was found that this could be cut into small rectangles for assembly in a 100 VA transformer core, supplied in kit form (eg. R.S. Components in U.K.). Thin card placed betw een the laminations was used to insulate them from each other. The arrangement was as shown in Fig. 10, with legs A and B being formed by the bimetallic pieces. Pr imary and secondary windings, respectively series-connected in pairs, were fo rmed on each of the legs A and B. The test involved observing on an oscill oscope the changing shape of the B-H magnetization loop as primar y current input increased. To present the B-H loop on an oscillos cope screen the secondary winding was connected across a 100k resistor in series with a 2 Î¼F cap acitor and the Y input to the oscilloscope was taken acro ss the capacitor terminals. The H input was provided by incorporating a series resistor in the primary feed circuit and taking the X input from the potential drop acro ss that resistor. What I was intending by this experiment was to estimate the eddy-cu rrent loss resulting from the bimetallic lamination feature. Ha ving done Ph.D. research studying anomalous eddy-current losses e xperimentally I was particularly curious as I had never heard of anyone ever before testing a transformer built using bimetalli c Fe:Ni laminations. Moreover I knew that I was using laminations that were much thinner, though more conductive, than is cust omary in transformers. Added to this, I knew from my Ph.D. research days, during which I measured the loss factors in different elemental sectors of th e B-H loop, that there was a particularly high and inex p licable loss in a p art of the loo p where it was least to be ex p ected.

I did not have to do any calculations. With such thin lami nations magnetized well below saturation at mains power frequency, the B-H picture on the screen at low current was a straight line angled to represent the magnetic permeability. The fact that it was a line meant that there was negligible loss, which is what I e xpected until a certain threshold was reached. My reasoning was that the transformer action would introduce heat into the core and that heat would be conducted away. I had planned to arrange for the heat to flow one way so as to set up a temperature difference across the laminations and then my presumption was that a d.c. current would circulate thermo -electrically and affect the form of the loop. Indeed, a d.c. bias would displace the pos ition of the loop on the screen both in the X and Y directions. Note that a B-H loop with little eddy-curren t has a rather special shape representing hysteresis effects. An over-dominant eddy-curr ent effect makes the loop elliptical and the width of the loop, in tending to fill more and more of a bounding geometrical parallelogram form, is a measure of the loss portion of the reactive volt-amp input. Remember that magnetic energy is stored as inductance energy and, in oscillating, this energy sheds the loss which is represented by that loop. Now, what happened was astounding because, upon bringing the current input up to near mid-range, the B-H loop became very wi de and quite elliptical. Furthermore, as expected, it shifted laterally by a small but very apparent amount (about 15%). However, the ultimate surprise was that, as the current input increased, the loop began to topple and turn clockwise until, wi th a greater current, it actually went over so far as to lie in the 'top-left-to-bottom-right' sector of the oscilloscope screen, whereas it began at low current in the conventional 'bot tom-left-to-top-ri ght' orientation. This means that the transformer core havi ng the bimetallic laminations has either become a capacitor, which it is not, or the phase governing the power and magnetomotive force reacti on has inverted through 180 o . This is an obvious indication that the core wants to act as a generator by which heat sustains a current producing its magnetization and, instead of demanding input current to set up the reaction to the changing magnetic flux, it produces current in a forward direction augmenting that magnetic condition. In the experiment, of cour se, all that extra current drawn from heat goes into enhancing the eddy-c urrent losses enormously. Th is is why the loop gets so wide. So, here was confirmation that there is a process involved in the magnetization of bimetallic laminations that enhances ener gy transfer productive of anomalous current flow. The source of energy is heat input, but if we dissipate the el ectricity before taking it off for useful purposes, so we see nothing abnormal in the overall energy action.

That device has its own a special way of taking off that electricity before it develops those very high e ddy-currents. Here, in fact, was a new development, a discovery which had eluded the author's P h.D research and which could have enabled the author to build a 'free energy' device deca des ago, had this insight been apparent in those early years. But who w ould have thought that a transf ormer built from laminations of iron and nickel bonded in la yers could tell us anything new about electromagnetism? It must be said, however, that the 'special ' way of taking electrical energy from a stack of bimetallic laminations, as used in the prototype devices, involves building those laminations into a parallel plate capacitor. That is not an easy task and to take it from the demonstration prototype to the commercial world needs the support of a major semi- conductor partner. The task is much easie r with this new understanding of the physics involved and attention is being given to the possibility of drawing the power off by magnetic induction. It is in this regard that Scott Strachan, the Scotsman who has built the three prototype de vices to date, did become preocc upied by a new discovery not yet published by which the thermoelectric action ca n be controlled with negligible power input, much as a grid in a thermionic valv e can control the current between anode and cathode. However, progress on that is extr emely slow and, as the need for a new refrigeration technology cannot await Strachan's solitary endeavours, so I am disclosing by this letter my own experimental findings to arouse interest and expedite onward development. I see the experiment ju st reported as one that very clea rly indicates that heat can be converted into electricity to provide refrigeration technol ogy which, at the same time generates electrical power. The on e step essential to the completion of this picture is the verification that if Scott St rachan, or others who now re plicate the device, builds a fourth prototype device in which the electric al power circuit is not mounted on the 'hot' heat sink, then that heat sink will also cool. The above is also my message to thos e companies now expressing interest in researching this project.

The article was writ ten as an open letter addressed to Don Kelly, Editor of the Space Energy Association's Quarte rly Space Energy News, where it was duly published in December 1993. It is also scheduled to be published in Nexus Magazine early in 1994. It seems appropriate to reproduce first th e relevant text from that article: \"The third experiment which tells me that I am on the verge of a breakthrough in penetrating the barrier giving access to 'free energy' in a soli d-state device has yielded its own surprises.

Again I used the above-described technique of studying the shape and form of the B-H loop developed by the a.c. flux. The a.c. excitation was of low magnetic flux density amplitude so that the ed dy-current losses should be negligible, as should hysteresis loss. I was ope rating in the flux rotation zone and above the B-H knee where rotational hysteresis loss diminishes rapidl y to zero. I expected the B-H 'loop' to show as a line on my oscilloscope and, indeed, such a line di d appear. I had to expand it off the range of the screen by increasing the x deflecti on sensitivity substantially in or der to trace the small capacitive contribution of my circuit for inte grating induced EMF to derive the B signal. I could find no trace o f a loss. Moreover, the line was not curved; it was very straight, which meant that the incremental p ermeability effective in the di rection transverse to d.c. polar ization was virtually constant. This was as expected from my theoretical reasoning, but there was a surprise in that the transverse p ermeability was smaller than I expected, by a factor of ten. N ow, if you are wondering what this means, note that my object is to store 'reluctance' energy by that transverse excitation, meaning energy that goes in as inductance energy and is recovered without loss on the down quarter cycle. By making that tran sverse oscillation stronger and stronger the object is then to deflect the primary polarization so that the intrinsic ferromagne tic power develops flux oscillations in the axis of the primary coil. The a im is to tap energy from that deflected 'reluctance' energy source, most of which is pow ered by the atomic spins in the ferromagnet, and use that energy on the up quarter cycle. This process then allows the polarizing bias, whic h could be that provided by a permanent magnet, to reset as the tranverse current dimi nishes, but the short-fall in the stored 'reluctance' energy given back to the magnetizing coil in that transverse direction has then to be made up by the magnet. The experiment I report here goes no further than s howing that the transverse excitation is a pure, virtually loss-free, inductive process which i nvolved a characteristic magnetic permeability indicating a 30:1 ratio of ferroma gnetic power input compared with ex ternal power input. That is the starting point which will, I am sure, lead to the f ourth experiment in which that energy is diverted and used without affecting the input magnetization circuit. Th en the recovery of energy upon demagnetization of that latter circ uit will occur, but as it cannot take used energy back from a load, the polarizing magnetic source simply has to do th e work and so leave the quantizing vacuum field in a cooler state. Rather than wait until I am ready to report such fu rther progress, I thought it appropriate to inform you and via you the readers of your Newsletter at this stage.\" ________ I now intend in this Report to extend my disclosure on developments from this experiment but, since this particular project promises the best route to tapping aether en ergy by solid-state apparatus, and there is much research now needed before the pate nt cover is secure, I will limit what is said.

Copyright in this report is also preserved. As to the principles of the experiment, firstly, the object is to work a ferrom agnetic core in such a way that its windings do not cancel the action and so defeat the purpose of allowing the core to contribute some of its intrinsic energy to our out put circuit in each successive magnetizing cycle. Secondly, the core has to work hard in this effort and so it must operate at a level of magnetization above the knee of the B-H curve or even close to saturation. Thir dly, as much of the core as possible should be involved in this exerci se, not just a small portion in a la rge magnetic circuit. Fourthly, our technique for accessing that energy is to contrive operation so that the input circuit responds as a p ure linear inductance whilst the ferromagnetic core acts as a catalyst to feed thermodynamic power to the output circuit electrically. The drawing in APPENDIX C illustrates a core struct ure that serves this purpose. The illustration of Fig. 3 should be self explanatory. It is an extract from an early U.K. Patent No. 855,907 dating from April 1956 and of which the author was inventor in his employee capacity with a major U.K. electrical company. However, though there are tec hnical features of that development which the author has called to mind in devel oping this 'free energy' application, the specific mode of excitation needed to tap that 'free energy' were not disclose d nor, indeed, thought of at the time of that early invention. A spiral wound steel film coated with insulati on has a cylindrical form and is wound around an axially central conductor. A solenoidal winding enco mpasses the core. Current I in the solenoidal winding produces a magnetic fi eld parallel with the core axis, whereas current I' in the central conductor produces a magnetic field in a circumferent ial sense. The thin steel film constituting the cylindrical core is everywhere subjected to the cr oss-field magnetization eff ects of two fields acting at right angles to each other. The currents I and I' must, acting together, be suff icient to set up a near saturation condition in the core. The central conductor winding is d.c. biased and excite d with a.c. of smaller am plitude to function as an inductance setting up a circumferential field with energy cycling in and out and subject to very little frequency-dependent loss. There is some I 2 R loss in the winding. The intrinsic ferromagnetic energy that corresponds to the near saturation state is represented by a spin state that precesses, in effect, during the cyclic reorientation. In so doi ng, it induces an EMF in the solenoidal winding and this puts output power into a load connected to that winding during both half cycles of the a.c. oscillations. That output power ta ps the ferro-magnetic spin ener gy that the aether supplies by thermodynamic cooling in keeping the ferromagne t its its low minimal en ergy potential state. The way in which one should see this is that, l ooking in any direction of strong magnetization, with the precession moving away from that direction, the BH component is reducing without returning all that energy to the aether system. Instead it transf ers some to the load circuit. With the precession moving into that direction, the BH energy component builds up by input of aether field energy accompanied by thermodynamic aethe r field cooling and, at the same time, sends some of that energy to the load circuit. A normal transformer runs solely on the HB energy transfers that are conservative in the material system. The 'free energy' future transformers will conserve energy too but will extend the conservation territory to th at of the space medium.

HAROLD ASPDEN ENERGY SCIENCE LIMITED c/o SABBERTON PUBLICATIONS P.O. BOX 35, SOUTHAMPTON, SO16 7RB ENGLAND APPENDIX A THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS: PHYSICS EDUCATION 28 , 340-342: 1993 Whilst strongly supporting the view e xpressed by Moore (Physics Education, 28 , pp. 228-237; 1993) that greater emphasis should be given to non-equili brium processes in teachi ng thermodynamics, it is submitted that such teaching gets off to the wrong start by the very prescrip tion of the First Law of Thermodynamics as the governing doctrine. It is the Principle of Conservati on of Energy that should be declared as fundamental. The First Law of Thermodynamics, if retained in the physics curric ulum under that name only serves as a 'number one' precedent to the 'number two' law. A thermal system with no heat flow would be at a uniform temperature. A purely thermal system with heat flow can be in equilibrium with heat flow. Non-equilibrium processes imply actions which are not solely concerned with the flow of heat in a system. In presenting his case, Moore begins by reciting that First Law as having a mean ing expressed by: E = Q - W where E is the change in energy, Q is heat flow and W is work done. N ote the words 'change', 'flow' and 'done'. The Principle of Energy Cons ervation requires that a change of energy between its various states, such as heat, electric pot ential, gravitational potential or kinetic energy sums to zero and I do not see why a stude nt should have to have to learn this as a law of 'thermod y namics'. Pa g e 28 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"At the outset of his argument, Moore defines 'heat' as 'the interaction th at occurs between two systems, or between a system and its surroundings by virtue of a temp erature difference'. This is not correct, because 'heat' is a form of energy - a s calar quantity, whereas a te mperature difference has direction and so is a vect or. 'Heat flow' can be said to have th e prescribed definition. This shows how careful one needs to be with words in teaching the fundament als of the subject. In his following sentence Moore st ates: 'A temperature difference can be further defined in terms of lack of thermal equilibrium between two systems ...' Later he says 'A new generation of physics textbooks will probably be needed to cope with the fundamentals involved in the teaching of non- equilibrium thermodynamics at a base level'. However, I suggest that the question at issue is whether we are concerned with the physics of temperature difference or whether we are erring in using 'thermodynamics' to relate to somethi ng that is not strictly 'thermal'. Physics today, and science generally, covers such a vast field and there has to be economy in teaching techniques, whilst conserving fundame ntals. We need to understand how energy can redeploy and how order can evolve from chaos, but that is not the subj ect of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics has only become in volved because, historically, it has been used to draw an arbitrary line between the possible and the impossible, but this is a line which is not holding steady. The energy that does cross that line in going from chaos to order is not heat, as such. However, it can create heat after making the transition. One has to distinguish between the phys ics of heat flow that involves a temperature differential and th e physics of energy conversion generally. In stating the fundamental princi ples underlying that First Law of Thermodynamics, with examples in mind, one really needs to set the stage for th e student who may progress and have to face the following two problems. Firstly, when a ferromagnetic subs tance cools down through its Curie temperature it releases heat over and above that associated with its normal sp ecific heat. This extra heat happens to equal the sum of the magnetic energy which is thereby established, meaning the energy needed to set up the same field conditions in an air-cored solenoid as exist in the saturation state of the magnetism created in each ferromagnetic domain, and the addi tional work done in setting up the mechanical strains associated with that magnetism. Readers will find, on considering this, that, no twithstanding misguided attempts to bring in magnetism as a negative potential, the Fi rst Law of Thermodynamics does not hold . We do not have here a situation where the work done requires a loss of heat. The only system we recognize as p resent is the substance of the ferromagnet. Unless there really are two syst ems inside one another, one that supplies energy from a s ource we cannot see or sense in te mperature terms, there is no way of keeping an energy balance according to that First Law of Thermodynamics. So, turning to the Principle of C onservation of Energy, we need to ad mit that our 'system' comprises an underlying sub-quantum field medium as a coexte nsive system having its own reserve of 'zero- p oint energy'. One presumes that there are in that field medium quantum effects at work in priming those spins in atoms that we sa y establish the ferromagnetic state. Secondly, although one finds in books on cosmology th at one can ask such questions as 'is the vacuum gravitating?' (see section 11, chapter 1 of Novikov's 'Evolution of the Universe', Cambridge University Press; 1983), one does not see the equa lly important question 'does the vacuum have a temperature?'. Yet, when we look into the space enveloping body Ea rth there is evidence of thermal equilibrium manifested by the 2.7 K radiation. For some reason this 'heat energy' is deemed to be a residue of the Bi g Ban g in the scenario of the ex p andin g universe.

The pure vacuum, devoid of matter, mu st have its own quasi-s tatic equilibrium and p robably will not exhibit a temperat ure. Here, the word 'probably' is used because, in common with so much that is theorized about in cosmology, one really does not know the certain answer, but we need to imagine the likely scenario in our effort to solve the riddles of Nature. However, assuming that, if matter did not exist, the vacuum would have no temperature, what cosmologists then fail to do is to apply the Prin ciple of Energy Conservati on or that First law of Thermodynamics to the st raightforward question of how matter , that we know exists, interacts gravitationally and thermally with that elusive vacuum medium. Consider the energy balance equation: Ï m + kT = 0 or: Ï m + mv 2 /2 = 0 where m is the mass of a virtual particle deemed by Novikov (in following Ze l'dovich) to constitute the vacuum medium, T is the temperature of the particle , k is Boltzmann's constant, v is speed and Ï is a measure of gravitational potentia l attributable to matter within gr avitational range of the particle of mass m. The equations apply in a physical sense because, by analogy with magnetism in the first problem, gravitational potential is said to be a negative quantity, though really it is a manifestation of an exchange of energy with that hidden field system. Now, much as we think we know all there is to know about gravitation, we really have no adequate reason for believ ing that gravitation can act over a range exceeding a few hundred light years. Indeed, if gravitation has a limited range of action that could explain why stars form in separate space domai ns rather than converging into one central core to set up a reversal of the Big Bang scenario. The gravitational coupl ing across a galaxy can be one that is a chain coupling linking stars that are sepa rated by less than the critical range of action. Note again that the words 'can be' are used deliberat ely, because students have much to gain by being shown that we are uncertain, which leaves them something to delve into in finding their own way forward in physics! From a teaching viewpoint, it is then of interest to estimate the grav itational potential at the centre of the sun, based solely on the solar mass. We know Ï and so can derive v, the speed imparted to the mass m. When this calculation is performed that speed v is found to be much the same as the translational speed of our solar system through th e cosmic background. Therefor e, if the formation o f the sun meant that gravitational energy was shed, then that could have been taken up as kinetic energy by imparting a translat ional non-thermal motion to mass seated within the sun. Should one view the relati onship as coincidental or does it have significance cosmologically? The teacher cannot offer the certain answer to this question and so that may be a reason for not telling the student. However, physics e ducation should not just be about wh at teachers know but should also give students an insight into what teachers do not yet know! Looking at the equation involving T, one may apply th is to the vacuum medium in the near vicinity of Earth. Here the gravitational po tential can also be calculated. The effect of the sun dominates that of Earth by a factor of 14, so we need not be too rigorous about specifying an altitude in making this calculation.

However, the exact numerical coefficien t is not too important in making the p roposition that the 2.7 K cosmic background radiation temperature is local evidence of the Principle of Conservation of Energy or that First Law of Thermodynamics in the vacuum itself. The known gravitational potential attributable to the solar system in the vicinity of Earth, plus that 2.7 K temperature as measured, lead us, from the energy conservation equation, to derive a 'measured' value of m. The mass of the virtual particles forming the vacuum medium can, th erefore be shown to be approximately 0.04 time s the mass of the electron*. The main thrust of these remark s is that the Principle of Cons ervation of Energy is a sufficient statement of whatever is intended by the First La w of Thermodynamics and it does have the merit of embracing actions that are not ex clusively thermal or temperature-related. However, in its application we need to be open to energy excha nges involving the vacuum medium and we must then come to terms with the problem that so many physicists think it best to avoid, namely delving into the properties of a real vacuum medium. This is forbidden territory because it is outlawed by the theory of relativity. In summary, whilst students need to know how in ternal combustion engines and electric kettles conform with the principles of thermodynamics, the laws of thermodynamics must no longer be p resented as barriers which pr eclude exploration of new energy fields. One governing condition suffices, the Principle of Conserva tion of Energy, and its application to a physical system embracing the total field environment and if we hypothesise laws of thermodynamics by appeal to 'experience' we should keep in mind that students of the futu re may yet 'experience' something that past textbook authority did not 'experience'. _ ____________________________________________________________________ * It is beyond the scope of this commentary to show in detail how one can confirm this value m by an independent test, save to say th at the vacuum has the ability to define the value of the fine structure co nstant in terms of the ratio of the mass m to the mass m e of the electron: hc/2 Ï e 2 = (108 Ï )(4m/m e ) 1/2 A derivation of the above is presented by the author in Lettere al Nuovo Cimento, 40 , 53-57 (1984).

The Dirac abstract 'spin' mathematical route to this factor of 2 is wrong and has led science away from the 'free energy' opportunities. The alternative is to accept the simple explanation as a diamagnetic reaction from free conduction ch arge in the metal. Then one is confronted with the need to exte nd the argument to the vacuum medium and accept that the aether contains charge in mo tion that can set up a reacting magnetic field, even under steady d.c. field conditions. This la tter proposition has now been verified by experiment reported earlier in this Report. An insight into the formal theory as applied to reaction in metal is presented below, as it recently appeared in the author's U.K. Patent Specifi cation No. 2,267,995. ___________ To determine the strength of the A-field reaction in a metal conductor one needs to note that each conduction electron moves at a high velocity and is subject an electric potential mainly sourced in the positive residual electric charge of the atoms which have shed those conduction electrons. These atoms are locked into the metal crystal structure a nd so the free electrons m ove under the constraint of a local electric force F(r) which has a com ponent constraining the el ectron to move between collisions in general orbital paths of radius r centred on the atoms. If a magnetic field of strength B is also present this supplements the electric force by a component force Bev, where e is the electro magnetic charge of the electron a nd v its speed in circular orbit about an axis aligned with the direction of B. N ote that the force F(r) is a restoring force propo rtional to displacement of the electron from a notional position of rest, assuming it has no motion. The restoring force factor depends on boundary shape but is the same throughout any metal structur e having parallel planar boundaries, regardless of the direction of charge displacement. Its value is halved within a cylindrical metal structure provided the displacement is in a plane at right angles to the cylinder axis. Therefore a displacement through a distance r will involve adding potential energy of F(r)r/2. The force equation, assuming th at B is zero, is simply: F(r) = mv 2 /r ............. (1) If one now sums the effective kinetic energy component attributable to v for all the free electrons in a unit volume of the metal and write that as energy density W, the equation gives: Î£ F(r)r/2 = Î£ mv 2 /2 = W .......... (2) N ow bring in the action of the B field. This adds th e force term in Bev to the left hand side of equation (1) and so changes equa tion (2) in the following way: Î£ F(r)r/2 + Î´Î£ F(r)r/2 + B Î£ evr/2 = W + Î´ W ........ (3) N ext, note that the terms in F give rise to a potential energy and it is appropriate to bring the energy terms together on the right-hand side of the e quation into a single energy density function that depends upon B. Denoting this energy density function as E, equations (2) and (3) combine to give: B Î£ evr/2 = Î´ E ..............(4) The ex p ression involvin g evr/2 is a measure of the reactin g ma g netic moment of each conduction Pa g e 32 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"electron. It develops a back-field or reaction field which is denoted the 'A-field' and which, if scaled by a factor g, has the value: A = 4 Ï g Î£ evr/2 ................ (5) The B-field acting on each conduction electron is, therefore, a combined field effect produced by a p rimary field which we write as gB and this is offs et by the field of strength A. Note that the same scaling factor has been used to modify the B field as is used to modify the reaction field. Reasons for this will be apparent in what follows, but one ne eds to keep in mind that a unity value must be assigned to g to comply with orthodox teachings on this subject. One can now write: B = gB - A .............. (6) Combining equations (4), (5) and (6): Î´ E = (gB - A)(A)/4 Ï g ............. (7) which is a simple relationship representing an en ergy quantity which tends to maximize because its negative potential energy com ponent tends to a minimum. The variable in the equation is the value of the A -field. Differentiating equation (7) with respect to A shows that the energy densit y attributable to the B-field is a maximum when: gB - 2A = 0 .............. (8) which shows that the strength of the A-field reaction is exactly half of gB and, from equation (6) this means that g is precisely 2. Then, from equation (7) this, in turn, means that: Î´ E = B 2 /8 Ï ............. (9) which is the conventional magne tic field energy density formul a in the units we are using. The result of this analysis is that when a primary magnetic fiel d acts on the free conduction electrons in a metal there is, inevitably, a half-field reaction, the A-field, which is opposed to that primary field. Since, in the past, one has been able to wo rk with theory which presumes there is no such reaction, then the B-field which is known to be effective in the metal must owe its action to a magnetizing effect twice as strong as the B-fiel d. The half-field reaction has passed unnoticed in experiments because one has failed to double the pr imary field action before halving it. Therefore, the moment of electric current attributable to th e electron, which is represented by a term such as (evr/2), and which would otherwise be deemed to represent the reac tion, must also be incremented by that same g-factor. This explai ns why the g-factor was introduced in equation (6). It makes sense of an otherwise impossible situation. N ote that the half-field reaction is sensed in gyromagnetic reacti on measurements, where observation based on reversing the ordered el ectron activity which is associat ed with magnetic polarization causes a proportional reversal of angular momentum. The ratio of th e electrical current moment to the angular momentum, as measured, is twice that expected from conventi onal theory based on the known charge/mass ratio of the electron. This gyrom agnetic ratio factor of two is the g-factor deduced above. The experiment confirms the theory presented. N ote also that the interpretation of the gyromagnetic reaction in terms of the 'A -field' is indisputably strong, but it does require the concomitant recogniti on that there is an A-field vacuum reaction involving the charges which account for Maxwell di splacement currents. This A-field reaction in the vacuum or aether is the basis on which inductive ener gy is stored as a magnetic field. Physicists have for most of the 20th century, at le ast until recent times, sought to avoid referring to the aether or reco g nizin g it as an active ener gy medium, and this has been to the detriment of innovative ener gy Pa g e 33 of 34 25.4.2005 htt p ://www.as p den.or g /re p orts/Es1/esr1.htm"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"technology.
