The question is,did his eccentricities eclipse his genius? Does it matter? Larry Page, a founderof Google, praises him as “a hero.” Elon Musk’s car and company bear his name.Entrepreneurs like Page and Musk—multibillionaires and brilliantdiscoverers—point to Nikola Tesla as the one who launched our modern era ofelectricity, radio, and robots. They consider him an inventor’s inventor,something of a folk legend.Tesla’s electric motors run our appliances and factories, so why is ThomasEdison the more famous of the two? Likewise, Guglielmo ­Marconi gets popularcredit for inventing the radio, yet the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Tesla’spatents first described the system for transmitting wireless signals over longdistances.Who was this farsighted, if underappreciated, mastermind?Perhaps the best introduction occurred in 1891, on a spring night in New YorkCity, when hundreds crammed into an auditorium on the Columbia College campus towitness a key battle in the “War of the Currents.” Serbian-born Nikola Tesla haddeclared that his method of harnessing electricity could outperform andoutdistance Thomas Edison’s system. Once an employee and now a rival of Edison,Tesla also claimed he could transmit sound with electrical charges. Thescientists and engineers came to see Tesla—inventor and scientificmagician—wield his wondrous power.The thirty-five-year-old Tesla was invited to the stage by the two ColumbiaSchool of Mines professors—the university had only started an electricalengineering program two years earlier. They’d arranged for Tesla to install hisinnovative high-frequency alternator offstage, in a nearby building called the“cowshed.” The plan was for Tesla to unveil his latest discoveries with greatshowmanship in front of a huge audience.Tesla expected controversy from the crowd, which included several Edisonsupporters. Edison’s direct current, or DC, and incandescent bulbs had becomethe standard and were backed by J. P. Morgan and other powerful bankers. Twelveyears had passed since Edison introduced his lamp with a glowing carbon filamentwithin a vacuum and nine years since he opened the first central power stationon Pearl Street in New York City. Yet DC’s one-directional charge could bedistributed for only a mile or so, and Edison’s lamps were notoriouslyinefficient and prone to burning out. Could Tesla’s new ideas overcome Edison’sfinancial and commercial advantages?Nearly a decade younger than the self-taught Edison, Tesla had an impressive andextensive education. He wrote poetry, recited complete books from memory, andspoke eight languages—English, Serbo-Croatian, Czech, Hungarian, German, French,Italian, and Latin. This polyglot reveled in the excitement of discovery. “I donot think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that feltby the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success,” hesaid. “Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.”1[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-1]Tesla had already challenged Edison and his supporters in publications, claiminghe could build bigger generators, longer transmission lines, and more reliablelamps. In opposition to Edison’s direct current, Tesla championed alternatingcurrent, or AC, which periodically reversed the direction of the electricalcharge. His breakthrough, the Tesla coil, could reliably deliver high-frequency,high-voltage electricity. And with that ability, Tesla predicted, companiescould transmit power over long distances.The eager crowd arrived early at the auditorium—located in a gray-slab GreekRevival building between Madison and Park Avenues on 49th Street. Having heardabout Tesla’s man-made lightning, they wanted to see if someone subjected to tenthousand volts, delivered via alternating current, would burst into flames orshoot sparks from his fingertips. Despite the circus-like atmosphere, suchlectures were formal affairs, with the audience of male scientists in blacksuits; a few accompanying wives accented the scene with an occasional plume orlace jabot.After a short introduction by one of the professors, Tesla approached the stagehaltingly. He was a slender man who dressed with a European formality, and forthis demonstration he wore his usual dapper four-button, dark-brown cutawaysuit, a white monogrammed silk shirt, gray suede gloves, and a black tie,arranged in the old-fashioned, four-in-hand style. At six feet three inches, hetowered over his introducer. Tesla had a thick, neatly trimmed mustache, angularface, and wavy hair severely parted down the middle. Surviving severe bouts ofmalaria and cholera in his teens had left Tesla with a lifelong fear of germs.Walking onstage, he avoided shaking hands, keeping his own clasped behind him,but he bowed politely to a few colleagues. His deep-set, pale, and glimmeringeyes stilled the audience.When he opened his mouth, his high, almost falsetto voice must have surprisedthe crowd; he spoke in what he called “pure, nervous English.” Tesla began bypraising a few of the distinguished scientists, including two he knew feltthreatened by his new system. More surprisingly, he admitted that he did notfully understand electricity. “Of all the forms of nature’s immeasurable,all-pervading energy, which ever and ever change and move, like a soul animatesan innate universe, electricity and magnetism are perhaps the mostfascinating.”2 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-2]With a joyful smile, Tesla declared: Electricity—what could be more mysteriousand useful?His long, thin hands trembled with enthusiasm as he drew diagrams and formulason a large blackboard, proving the superiority of high-frequency alternatingcurrent that could be sent hundreds of miles. He predicted how increasing theoscillations within an alternating current produced new forms of energy andenabled wireless communications, predating Marconi’s discoveries by a decade.Like a seasoned actor, the usually shy Tesla sensed the crowd’s growing interestin his props—an assortment of tubes and bulbs arrayed on a long wooden table atthe front of the stage between two large zinc plates suspended from the ceiling.The inventor transformed himself into a showman. Throwing a switch connected tohis motor and alternator out in the “cowshed,” Tesla cranked up the current’sfrequency. An electric arc surged across two poles, creating purplish sparks andloud bursts of crackles. Tesla increased the oscillations, and the tone becamesmoother and higher pitched, the streamers turning a radiant white—in front of acaptivated audience, he created lightning on stage. Spark-generated ozonescented the air, what some likened to chlorine bleach and others to the odor ofwet hay. The soaring streamers produced a wind felt by those sitting in thefirst several rows.The showstopper was still to come. Tesla waved gas-filled tubes between theelectrified sheets of zinc placed on both sides of the stage. Within theelectrostatic field created by those plates, which were about fifteen feetapart, the tubes glowed. No wires, no flames, no heat, and yet the gas in thetubes fluoresced. The tubes appeared to one reporter “like a luminous sword heldin the hand of an archangel representing justice.”3 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-3]Another predicted wireless lighting would “bring fairy-land within our homes.”4[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-4]Even Tesla recognized his growing impact on the audience, several of whomconsidered electricity an occult force. “It is difficult to appreciate whatthose strange phenomena meant at the time,” he observed later. “When my tubeswere first publicly exhibited, they were viewed with amazement impossible todescribe.”5 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-5]“Mr. Tesla seemed to act the part of a veritable magician,” reported ElectricalReview. “It seemed to make little difference whether the lamps were lying on thetable or whether they were connected by one terminal to one pole of the coil, orwhether the lecturer took a lamp in each hand and held one to each pole of thecoil. . . . In each and every case the filaments were brought to incandescence,to the supreme delight of the spectators.”6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-6]Tesla’s wonders promised more than profits. “All around us everything isspinning, everything is moving, everywhere is energy,” declared the scientist.“There must be some way of availing ourselves of this energy directly.” Withsuch an achievement, he said, “Humanity will advance with greatstrides. . . . [The] mere contemplation of these magnificent possibilitiesexpands our minds, strengthens our hopes, and fills our hearts with supremedelight.”7 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-7]Within the cheering crowd, there were some hecklers. Michael Pupin led a smallband of scientists who raised a ruckus. Pupin was a fellow Serbian immigrant, acompetitive and egotistical researcher who believed he had developed a bettermotor that could run on alternating current, albeit with a design based onTesla’s patents. While “I was lecturing,” Tesla complained later, “Mr. Pupin andhis friends interrupted . . . by whistling, and I had difficulty quieting downthe misled audience.”8 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-8]But the vast majority of those assembled proved to be far more interested intechnological drama than personal squabbles. Tesla’s finale featured tens ofthousands of volts of alternating current passing through his own body: sparksindeed flew from his fingertips! Rebutting Edison’s claims about the dangers ofalternating current, the inventor declared that his AC was controlledelectricity. He claimed the high-frequency, low current he generated was no moreharmful than vibrations of light and that it remained on the surface of hisskin, causing no harm to his body.The lecture featured more than sparkling showmanship, as Tesla systematicallydescribed novel laws of electricity. Scientists had been used to certain wayspower moved when currents were of a steady character. However, when thosecurrents rapidly changed direction, when they alternated, new rules applied.Tesla presented his audience with an astounding list of practical applications.Well before others, he sensed the promise of alternating current. On stage, he’dtransmitted electricity wirelessly by charging two plates fifteen feet apart.How much further could energy travel wirelessly? By increasing a current’sfluctuations, he suggested his high-frequency alternator would send and receivemessages and sounds. He described long-distance electricity transmission,powerful motors, and laborsaving appliances. While not using our modern words,he foresaw—and later developed—radio, robots, and remote control.Tesla performed for three hours that night. Perfecting the role of entertainer,he concluded by saying that with more time he would have revealed even morerevolutionary experiments that he had conducted in his laboratory. He left theaudience, and possible investors, applauding loudly . . . and wanting more.Electrical Review hailed the event as “brilliant” and predicted attendees would“remember that occasion as one of the scientific treats of their lives.”9[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-9] Another reporter suggested Tesla had “eclipsed” Edisonwith a better incandescent bulb and gone beyond all other scientists withimproved light-producing vacuum tubes. Harper’s Weekly declared that Tesla “inone bound” had joined the ranks “of such men as Edison, [Charles] Brush, ElihuThomson, and Alexander Graham Bell.” Both Brush and Thomson were famous fordeveloping electrical generators and arc-lighting systems that brightened citystreets. Describing Tesla’s rags-to-riches story, the magazine added, “Yet onlyfour or five years ago, after a period of struggle in France, this striplingfrom the dim mountain border-land of Austro-Hungary landed on our shores,entirely unknown, and poor in everything save genius and training, andcourage.”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-10]Not everyone was impressed. The English journal Industries questioned Tesla’sdevotion to vision over practicality, a complaint that echoed throughout thescientist’s life. “Anyone who had read many of Mr. Tesla’s articles,” themagazine wrote, “must have difficulty in understanding the frequent vague andidiomatic statements with which they abound.”11 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-11]In fact, what the critic objected to may be a result of Tesla’s singular talent.There are many stories of him visualizing his inventions so clearly andcompletely that his articles may sound “vague and idio­matic” in comparison tothe diagrams in his head. Tesla was actually born during a lightning storm andhis earliest memories were of bright hallucinations that blurred his sense ofreality. Yet displaying one of many paradoxes, he also possessed the rareability to see and develop complex equipment in his thoughts, frequently needingneither models nor adjustments in order to realize his detailed inventions. Hisgenius may have been his ability to sort through the various bright visionsfilling his head and devise practical devices or prophetic ideas.This prolific maverick foresaw cell phones, radar, laser weapons, artificialintelligence, the Internet, fax machines, and vertical-lift airplanes. In hislifetime, Tesla obtained some three hundred patents and provided our moderneconomy with electric motors, robots, remote controls, and radio. According tothe American Institute of Electrical Engineers at the cusp of the twenty-firstcentury, “Were we to seize and eliminate from our industrial world the resultsof Mr. Tesla’s work, the wheels of industry would cease to turn, our electriccars and trains would stop, our towns would be dark, our mills would be dead andidle.”12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-12]Tesla also circulated quixotic notions that have complicated his legacy. Hesketched plans for communicating with intelligent beings on other planets,reading another person’s thoughts by attaching television equipment to herretina, and sending electricity wirelessly through the earth so everyone couldenjoy power at virtually no cost.Perhaps it’s not surprising, as noted in his New York Times obituary, that thisdistracted discoverer was “anything but a practical man as far as business wasconcerned.”13 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-13] He was bested by robber barons.Yet among inventors, even some seventy-five years after his death, Tesla’screativity and industriousness continue to inspire. Elon Musk recently donatedone million dollars to restore the scientist’s Long Island laboratory into amuseum. Perhaps the inventor’s reputation can be restored as well, and NikolaTesla will be accorded the fame he deserves."},{"pageContent":"1. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch1]BORN BETWEEN TODAY AND TOMORROW [06_Contents.xhtml#ch1]LikaIs it apocryphal—or appropriate—that Nikola Tesla was born in the midst of aviolent thunderstorm exactly at the stroke of midnight, between the ninth andtenth of July 1856?1 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-14] The frightened midwife feared hewould be “a child of the storm.” His mother, however, declared, “No, of light.”2[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-15]The weirdness of his birth during a midnight gale became part of Tesla familylore, no doubt assuring the young boy he possessed special qualities. His fatherwas a Serbian Orthodox priest, and when his beloved mother, Djuka, repeated thetale, she drew references to her religion’s Holy Fire and the symbolic power oflighting candles to overcome the darkness. In fact, light pervaded Tesla’s life,filling his mind with both inspirational and bizarre visions. The birth storyalso placed Nikola Tesla in the present as well as the future, neither today nortomorrow.Ambiguity and mutability molded Tesla’s personality. He was born a Serb in whattoday is Croatia. The vast majority of his neighbors attended Roman Catholicchurches, while his family practiced Serbian Orthodox Christianity, making Teslaa member of a religious as well as an ethnic minority. While their small villagewas under the rule of the Habsburg Monarchy, the region faced constant changeand would soon be part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Growing up Serbian evoked not only ethnic pride but also a tragic past—anotherof Tesla’s many paradoxes. Serbian national poetry, according to Tesla, was“full of the admiration for the feats of the heroes.”3 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-16]Although Balkan history is complicated and much debated, Tesla felt the Serbsfocused on the region’s most heartbreaking chapter: “Hardly is there a nationwhich has met with a sadder fate than the Serbians.” Their once splendid empirewas “plunged into abject slavery after the fateful battle of 1389 at the KosovoPolje, against the overwhelming Asian hordes.”4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-17] On thatday—considered as significant to the Serbs as the Exodus is to the Jews—somethirty thousand Turks obliterated the Serbian nation, converted its churchesinto mosques, enslaved its males into the Turkish army, and forbid Serbs fromowning property or learning to read, write, or play musical instruments. Nearlyfive hundred years in the past, that bloody event—the memory of which unifiedthe Serbian people’s identity—still prompted Serbs (and Tesla) to believe“Europe can never repay the great debt it owes to the Serbians for checking, bythe sacrifice of its own liberty, that barbarian influx.”5[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-18] That event also prompted Serbians to embody “in immortalsong” the “brave deeds of those who fell in the struggle for liberty.” Teslaproudly noted Serbia became “a nation of thinkers and poets.”6[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-19](The 1389 Battle of Kosovo took place on June 15, which became known as St.Vitus Day. Two other notable events occurred on that date: the Serbian 1876declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire and the 1914 assassination inSarajevo of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, which ignited World War I.)Tesla’s immediate family got its start in Senj, a small seaside town, wheresenior clerics had assigned his parents—the twenty-eight-year-old Milutin Teslaand the twenty-five-year-old Djuka Mandic—after their 1847 wedding. Tesla’sfather was the novice priest there, serving some forty households at the stonechurch perched on a steep cliff overlooking the Adriatic Sea, and he was torepresent Serbs before “foreign and Catholic persons.” Milutin’s mediating roleconfronted stark historical and cultural differences. The majority Croats, forinstance, followed the Roman form of Catholicism and embraced the Pope as theirspiritual leader, whereas Serbs worshiped in Greek Orthodox churches and adopteda Byzantine patriarch. Croats, moreover, utilized the Latin alphabet while Serbsprimarily wrote in Cyrillic.Milutin made a name for himself as a fervent Serbian advocate, writing inseveral journals about the need to preserve Serbian traditions and advance theirpolitical and social independence. When Milutin tried to have Serbian soldiersattend Orthodox services on Sundays, the Austrian military commander refused andordered the Serbs to participate in Roman Catholic Mass instead. “Nothing is assacred to me as my church and my forefathers’ law and custom,” Milutin penned ina letter, “and nothing so precious as liberty, well-being, and advancement of mypeople and my brothers, and for these two, the church and the people, wherever Iam, I’ll be ready to lay down my life.”7 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-20] He periodicallywrote for the Serbian Daily, including one piece that boasted: “This Serbianvalley is blessed with the greatest wealth in the world—its people are robustand heroic in every respect.”8 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-21]Djuka gave birth in Senj to the first three (Milka, Dane, and Angelina) of theirfive children, yet Milutin’s salary proved trifling and the damp air troubledhis health. After numerous attempts over eight years, the zealous preacherobtained a transfer in 1852 to the church of St. Apostles Peter and Paul, aweather-beaten, white structure within the village of Smiljan and the provinceof Lika, where Milutin served a larger congregation of eighty households. It wasin this more populated but still remote Croatian province in 1856 that Djukadelivered Nikola Tesla, the couple’s fourth child. Their daughter Marica wasalso born in Lika three years later.Tesla’s elder brother, Dane, had been his idol and the family’s favorite child.Considered “gifted to an extraordinary degree,”9 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-22] Dane wasexpected to follow his father into the clergy.Daily life in Smiljan—despite the name meaning “the place of sweet basil”—wasfilled with drudgery. Tesla’s neighbors said of their hard-to-farm homeland:“When God distributed the rocks over the earth He carried them in a sack, andwhen He was above our land the sack broke.”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-23] Theycleared those plentiful stones from the fields so crops could be tended withhand tools. To obtain illumination, warm their rooms, or cook their meals,villagers had to chop trees down with axes and carry the wood in slings andcarts to their houses. Far from any city, they endured remoteness, particularlythroughout the long winters.Tesla’s mother tackled that drudgery and isolation by developing severallaborsaving devices, including a mechanical eggbeater. Inventing out ofnecessity, she set a model for her son. With an aesthetic inventiveness, Djukaspun threads, created intricate designs, and fabricated most of the family’sclothing and home furnishings. Tesla wrote that even in her sixties, “herfingers were still nimble enough to tie three knots in an eyelash.”11[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-24] Later he declared, “I must attribute to my mother’sinfluence whatever inventiveness I possess.”Tesla also credited his mother with his own industriousness. She was, he wrote,“indefatigable and worked regularly from four o’clock in the morning till elevenin the evening. From four to breakfast time, 6 a.m., while others slumbered, Inever closed my eyes but watched my mother with intense pleasure as she attendedquickly—sometimes running—to her many self-imposed duties. She directed theservants to take care of all domestic animals, milked the cows, performed allsort of labor unassisted, set the table, prepared breakfast for the wholehousehold and only when it was ready to be served did the rest of the family getup. After breakfast everybody followed my mother’s inspiring example. All didtheir work diligently, liked it, and so achieved a measure of contentment. But Iwas the happiest of them.”12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-25]Accentuating his parental preference between his unlettered mother and learnedfather, Tesla admitted the training Milutin provided “must have been helpful,”but he stressed his mother’s accomplishments: “She was a truly great woman, ofrare skill, courage, and fortitude, who had braved the storms of life and passedthrough many a trying experience.”13 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-26] Djuka could neitherread nor write, and yet she could recite from memory long passages from theBible and epic Serbian poems. Tesla argued she would “have achieved great thingshad she not been so remote from modern life and its multifold opportunities.”14[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-27]Djuka herself was descended from a distinguished family of priests andinventors. Her grandfather, a cleric, received the Medal of Honor from Napoleonhimself for helping the French to occupy Croatia. One of her brothers became theArchbishop of Sarajevo and Metropolitan of the Serbian Orthodox Church inBosnia, while both her father and grandfather devised numerous farm andhousehold tools.Tesla’s father came from a military family and often told tales of tragicSerbian war heroes though he failed to follow the tradition of his ancestors,unlike his own father and brother. The army’s discipline did not suit Milutin,so after being reprimanded for not polishing his brass buttons sufficiently, heresigned and enrolled in an Orthodox seminary, where he graduated top of hisclass in 1845. As his son later remarked, Milutin “had a prodigious memory andfrequently recited at length from works in several languages.” The family, infact, joked that “if some of the classics were lost, he would be able to restorethem.” Considered something of a progressive, Milutin took up several politicalcauses, including compulsory education for children, schools where Serbs couldlearn their own language, and social equity among ethnic groups.15[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-28]Tesla found his father to be “a very erudite man, a veritable naturalphilosopher, poet, and writer.”16 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-29] Milutin composed poetryand editorials with a style of writing Tesla later said was “much admired [andwith] sentences full of wit and satire.” Milutin also spoke multiple languages,was an omnivorous reader, and proved to be an accomplished mathematician. Yetthe father was more religious than scientific, and he consistently pressured hisson to follow his own example. Tesla did not resemble his father; Milutin waspale and displayed a receding hairline, shiny forehead, high cheekbones, and afull beard. According to Tesla, Milutin also “had the odd habit of talking tohimself and would often carry on an animated conversation and indulge in heatedargument, changing the tone of his voice.”The father could be stern and disciplinary toward his children but show others asense of humor. When driving with a friend whose costly fur coat rubbed againstthe carriage wheel, for example, Milutin quipped, “Pull in your coat, you areruining my tyre.”17 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-30]Nikola was named after both grandfathers. The Tesla name, in ­Serbian, has twosomewhat related meanings. The first describes a ­person with protruding teeth,which was true of several family members but not of Nikola; the secondreferences an adze, a cutting tool used in woodworking that looks something likea strong upper jaw.The young Tesla spent a great deal of time with his two older sisters in achildhood he described as “blissful.” He played with pets and rode atop hisfather’s Arabian horse, which had been a gift from a family friend. Not so thefarm’s gander, which he later described as “a monstrous ugly brute, with a neckof an ostrich, mouth of crocodile, and a pair of cunning eyes radiatingintelligence and understanding like the human.” This “powerful enemy” onceseized the infant and “almost [pulled] out the remnant of my umbilical cord.”18[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-31] On another occasion, the gander attacked Tesla as heentered the poultry yard, grabbing “me by the seat of my trousers and shaking meviciously. When I finally managed to free myself and run away, he would flap hishuge wings in glee and raise an unholy chatter in which all the geese joined.”19[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-32]Family members recalled funny and revealing stories of young Tesla. One involvedtwo old aunts with wrinkled skin, “one of them having two teeth protruding likethe tusks of an elephant.” These relatives had the habit of hugging Teslaaggressively, and one regularly buried her face, protruding teeth and all, intohis neck. According to Tesla, they were “as affectionate as they wereunattractive.” While being carried one day in his mother’s arms, he was asked bythe aunts to choose which of them was prettier. Suggesting thoughtfulness (ifnot diplomacy), after examining their faces carefully, he declared, “This onehere is not as ugly as the other.”20 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-33]When one of the aunts suggested Tesla feared the family cow, he proceeded thatafternoon to demonstrate his bravery by climbing a fence and sliding onto thecreature’s “back for a ride when she made off with me bellowing and threw me.”Still, recalled Tesla, “I was none the worse for the experience.”21[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-34]Tesla’s home was an “old-fashioned structure located at the foot of a woodedhill called Bogdanic.” According to Tesla, “Adjoining it on the other side is achurch and behind the same, further up, a graveyard. Our nearest neighbors weretwo miles away and in the winter, when the snow was six feet deep, if not more,our isolation was complete.”22 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-35] (Noting the inventor’scontinued popularity in his native country, the buildings have been convertedinto a popular tourist attraction, located outside the still quiet hamlets ofSmiljan some ten minutes from a highway exit.)Isolation remained a theme throughout Tesla’s life. The remoteness that may havenecessitated his mother’s ingenuity also impeded her fame and convinced Tesla heneeded to move away in order to pursue his engineering goals. He did not see asteam locomotive or other industrial machines until he was a teenager. YetLika’s isolation garnered within Tesla a self-reliance, an independence, andthroughout his life he sought solitude in order to envision his revolutionarydesigns.The natural setting of Lika also prompted Tesla to observe carefully, and suchclose attention often led to profound insights. A snowball gaining size as itrolled down a hill gave rise to the concept of “magnification of feebleactions,” prompting Tesla later to consider using the earth’s resonance toamplify the impact of an electrical thrust. The appearance in order oflightning, thunder, and torrents convinced the sensitive young boy of thesequencing of nature’s secrets. Sensing the power that could be tapped fromcascading water, he also observed that if warm winds from the Adriatic meltedthe winter’s snow rapidly, “we would then witness the terrifying spectacle of amighty seething river carrying wreckage and tearing down everything movable inits way.”23 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-36]Tesla’s greatest youthful joy came from “our magnificent Macak—the finest of allcats in the world.” Maybe a lack of companionship prompted such devotion. “Wesimply lived one for the other,” he recalled. “Wherever I went Macak followedprimarily owing to our mutual love and then again moved by the desire to protectme. . . . He fascinated me so completely that I too bit and clawed andpurred. . . . [On rainy days] we went into the house and, selecting a nice, cozyplace, abandoned ourselves to each other in affectionate embracement.”24[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-37]Tragedy broke the tranquility when Tesla was seven years old. It seems thefamily’s beloved but high-spirited Arabian stallion bolted and threw thetwelve-year-old Dane, who died that night from his injuries. (Some biographershave proposed that Tesla spooked the horse or even knocked his brother down aflight of stairs, but there’s no evidence for such claims and Tesla’s reactionssuggest otherwise.)Young Tesla witnessed the terrible scene but offered few details about hisbrother’s accident. What he best remembered was his mother waking him in themiddle of that night. “It was a dismal night with rain falling in torrents,” herecalled. “My mother came to my room, took me in her arms and whispered almostinaudibly: ‘Come and kiss Dane.’ I pressed my mouth against the ice-cold lips ofmy brother knowing only that something dreadful had happened. My mother put meagain to bed and lingering a little said with tears streaming: ‘God gave me oneat midnight and at midnight he took away the other one.’ ”25[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-38] More than fifty-five years later, Tesla still lamented,“My visual impression of it has lost none of its force.”Having always favored Dane, Milutin and Djuka increasingly idolized the deadboy’s talents and consistently projected accomplishments if he had lived. Teslacould not compete with such an ideal. “Anything I did that was creditable merelycaused my parents to feel their loss more keenly,” he later wrote. “I grew upwith little confidence in myself.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-39] Tesla lived with theawkward knowledge that any success he earned reminded his parents of theachievements Dane could not claim.Although Tesla was precocious—probably at least as talented as Dane—he feltinadequate. “The recollection of [Dane’s] attainments makes every effort of mineseem dull in comparison,” he admitted. The message from his parents, especiallyhis father, was “don’t succeed.” Yet Tesla disclosed that the loss of hisbrother—and the ongoing failure to please his parents—pushed him to disciplinehis thoughts and actions.No doubt Tesla knew he was “far from being considered a stupid boy.” He recalledplaying with friends in the street and encountering a wealthy alderman who gavea silver piece to each of the boys. When the gentleman approached Tesla,however, he stopped and demanded, “Look in my eyes.” Tesla did as he was told,held out his hand for a coin, but disappointedly heard: “No, you can get nothingfrom me, you are too smart.”27 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-40]Losing their first-born son particularly affected Milutin. Although the fathercontinued preaching, he wrote fewer and fewer articles and poems. Trying toescape the sad memories of Lika, Milutin moved his family to Gospic, theregion’s administrative center. Tesla had loved the freedom of the farm’s openspaces, and he disliked the larger town’s pace and pressure. He particularlymissed his pigeons, chickens, and sheep. “In our new house I was but aprisoner,” he wrote, “watching the strange people I saw through the windowblinds. My bashfulness was such that I would rather have faced a roaring lionthan one of the city dudes who strolled about.”28 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-41]Two mishaps marked Tesla’s introduction to his new home. In the first, after oneof his father’s sermons, Tesla finished ringing the church bells in the belfryand rushed downstairs, accidentally tripping on the enormous train of a dressworn by the town’s wealthiest lady; the back of the gown “tore off with aripping noise which sounded like a salvo of musketry fired by raw recruits.” The“good and pompous woman” expressed great displeasure at the destruction of herelegant clothing, and Tesla’s father, “livid with rage,” gave him a “gentle slapon the cheek, the only corporal punishment he ever administered to me.” Deeplyembarrassed, Tesla felt further ostracized from both his father and thecommunity.29 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-42]The second mishap, however, provided some relief. The town’s fire department hadpurchased a new truck and pump, whose operation required the efforts of sixteenmen. On the day of its ceremonial inauguration, a crowd assembled to hearspeeches, yet the pump didn’t work. While the firemen and the school’s teachersdebated furiously about how to fix the problem, Tesla waded into the river and“instinctively felt for the suction hose in the water and found that it hadcollapsed.” When he loosened the knot, water rushed forth, the crowd cheered,and the firemen carried Tesla aloft on their shoulders and declared him to be“the hero of the day.”30 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-43]Milutin used the new location to launch an aggressive mind-training campaign,drilling his surviving son with “all sorts of exercise, such as guessing oneanother’s thoughts, discovering the defects of some form or expressions,repeating long sentences or performing mental calculations.” The restless youngTesla probably disliked the discipline, but later in life he reflected, “Thesedaily lessons were intended to strengthen memory and reason and especially todevelop the critical sense.”31 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-44]Milutin intended his son to be a cleric, in part to protect his only male heirfrom the dangers of the military and the rigors of intensive engineering study.Although the religious prospect “constantly oppressed” Tesla, who “longed to bean engineer,” his father proved to be inflexible. Milutin seemed hell bent onnot letting Nikola be Nikola.At the age of ten, Tesla entered Gospic’s Normal School, which added to hisfather’s regimentation. He excelled at mathematics and sciences and provedcapable of performing calculations in his mind, prompting allegations ofcheating from his teachers. The school introduced Tesla to mechanical models,with a water turbine attracting his special interest. Upon seeing an engravingof Niagara Falls in the classroom, he claimed to have informed an uncle that hewould one day travel to the United States and construct “a big wheel run by theFalls.” The young student devised “all kinds of contrivances and contraptions”but was particularly pleased with his crossbows and slings, which his teachers“judged to be the best in his class.”32 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-45]Tesla tinkered joyously—and often got into trouble. He relished taking apart hisgrandfather’s clocks but usually reassembled them incorrectly, provoking hisgrandfather to bring “my work to a sudden halt in a manner that was not toodelicate.” He developed a fairly creative pop gun—comprised of a hollow tube, apiston, and two plugs of hemp—and showed substantial shooting skill, but, as helater admitted, “My activities interfered with the window panes in our house,and soon met with the most painful discouragement.” Young Tesla also acted outthe role of Serbian heroes. Sword in hand, he mowed down enemies in the form ofcorn stalks, until his mother realized these battles were ruining her plants.She responded with several spankings, “not of the formal kind, but a genuinearticle.”33 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-46]As early as ten years old, he proclaimed he could provide the world withinexpensive and constant power, and he devised a “June bug engine” in which heglued four of the strongest beetles he could find to a tiny crosspiece of woodand had them spin a wheel, similar to mice on a treadmill. The bushes were blackwith these pests and they proved to be “remarkably efficient, for once they werestarted they had insufficient sense to stop.” Unfortunately for Tesla andhumanity, the town bully, the son of a retired army officer and whom theinventor referred to as an “urchin,” devoured the bugs and destroyed the engine.Electricity, however, elicited Tesla’s most intense interest, and he claimedthat his beloved cat, rather than school classes, introduced him to its wondersand mysteries. During a very cold and dry spell, he stroked Macak’s back and itbecame “a sheet of light and my hand produced a shower of sparks.” To Tesla, thestatic-electricity effect “was a miracle which made me speechless fromamazement.” The cat’s body, he observed, became “surrounded by a halo like theaura of Saints!” His usually curious mother became alarmed, saying “Stop playingwith the cat, he might start a fire.” Such flashes prompted Tesla’s childishimagination. “Is nature a gigantic cat and if so who strokes its back?” heasked. “It can only be God, I concluded.” Decades later he added: “Day after dayI asked myself what is electricity and found no answer. Eighty years have goneby since and I still ask the same question, unable to answer it.”34[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-47]Teachers encouraged Tesla’s newfound fascination. “I read all that I could findon the subject,” he wrote, and “experimented with batteries and inductioncoils.”35 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-48]Tesla’s wondrous and inventive mind was haunted by the obsessive. According tohim, trying to earn his father’s respect prompted his “many strange likes,dislikes, and habits.” Tesla went so far as to declare, “I would not touch thehair of other people except, perhaps, at the point of a revolver. I would get afever by looking at a peach.” He could not tolerate earrings on women; in hisown words, the “sight of a pearl would almost give me a fit.” Strangely,bracelets “pleased me more or less according to design.” Tesla counted his stepswhen on a walk, making sure they were divisible by three—or he felt compelled torepeat the exercise. Such quirks persisted throughout Tesla’s life. At each mealas an adult he demanded nine or eighteen napkins, a number divisible by three,and he wiped down each plate, bowl, and piece of silverware. Building on hismathematical talents, at the dinner table he also calculated “the cubicalcontents of soup plates, coffee cups and pieces of food—otherwise my meal wasunenjoyable.”36 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-49]Stranger still, the child born during a violent thunderstorm came to haveepisodes of seeing things with strobing intensity. This ordeal might have beenenough to make anyone superstitious. Tesla described it as “a peculiaraffliction due to the appearance of images, often accompanied by strong flashesof light that marred the sight of real objects and interfered with my thoughtand action.” The images of objects became so confusing, he said, “I could nottell whether what I saw was real or not.” Tesla even reached and passed his handthrough an object, yet “the image would remain fixed in space.”37[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-50] These “tormenting” flashes accelerated during times ofstress or exhilaration, and one particularly troubling image had “all the airaround me filled with tongues of living flame.”38 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-51] (Laterin life, this rationalist argued that these “tormenting appearances” were simply“the result of a reflex action from the brain on the retina under greatexcitation.”39 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-52] He also credited visions with allowing himto vividly see and manipulate inventions in his head.)Tesla also labeled his sight and hearing “extraordinary.” Able to “discernobjects in the distance when others saw no trace of them,” he boasted of savingseveral of his neighbors from fires by having heard “the faint crackling soundswhich did not disturb their sleep” and calling for help. Later in life, hebragged about hearing “very distinctly thunderclaps at a distance of 550 miles,”almost four times farther than any of his assistants.40 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-53]Tesla, however, admitted being a frail and vacillating child, having “neitherthe courage nor strength to form a firm resolve.” His feelings surged betweenextremes, and he “was swayed by superstitious belief and lived in constant dreadof spirits of evil, of ghosts and ogres and other unholy monsters of thedark.”41 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-54]What some would no doubt treat with drugs, Tesla dosed with willpower; he wasdetermined to control his thoughts and focus his mind. Believing the disturbinglikenesses were not explainable by psychology or physiology, he concentrated onthings he had seen in the real world. He also focused on images from books.Despite possessing a large library, his father discouraged him from reading,believing it strained his eyesight, and he “would fly into a rage when he caughtme in the act.” Yet each night the boy took to lighting hidden candles andcovering his bedroom door’s keyhole and cracks in order to enjoy isolated study.Perhaps Tesla’s greatest inspiration came when he discovered at the age of tenthe Serbian translation of Abafi by Miklos Josika, a well-known Hungarianwriter. Written in 1854, the story features a young nobleman, Oliver Abafi, whotransitions through sheer determination from being disruptive and frivolous tobeing noble and disciplined, to the point where he sacrifices himself for hisprince and country. The novel’s hero motivated Tesla to utilize his own cerebralpowers to control his feelings and actions. “At first my resolutions faded likesnow in April,” he wrote, “but in a little while I conquered my weakness andfelt a pleasure I never knew before—that of doing as I willed. In the course oftime this vigorous mental exercise became second nature. At the outset my wisheshad to be subdued but gradually desire and will grew to be identical.”42[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-55]Young Tesla’s mental exercises led him to unexpected places. Admitting that hehad accumulated limited experiences, he slowly discovered more satisfaction andpeace by going “on in my vision farther and farther.” “So I began to travel—ofcourse, in my mind,” Tesla admitted. “Every day, when alone, I would start on myjourneys—see new places, cities and countries—live there, meet people and makefriendships and acquaintances and, however unbelievable, it is a fact that theywere just as dear to me as those in actual life and not a bit less intense intheir manifestations.” While on these journeys he “made imaginary friends, whowere very dear to me and really seemed alive.”43 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-56] Theseimages, of course, were no more real than the debilitating and random flashesthat so troubled his youth, but he now controlled them. Such “incessant mentalexertion,” he later declared, “developed my powers of observation.”44[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-57]These “journeys” also advanced his imagination. He “saw new scenes” that,initially, were “very blurred and indistinct,” but through concentration they“gained in strength and distinctness and finally assumed the concreteness ofreal things.”45 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-58] Tesla concluded that this ability enabledhim as a man to “visualize with the greatest facility.”46 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-59]Tesla explored his imaginings in isolation. One aunt recalled when Tesla waswith relatives “he would always like to be alone.” Tesla went off in the morning“into the woods to meditate. He measured one tree to another, making notes,experimenting.” Such solitary behaviors startled local peasants. According to acousin, “They would approach and say, ‘We’re sorry; your [cousin] seems to becrazy.’ ”47 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-60]Tesla found nothing strange about concentrating attention upon himself. “Ittaught me to appreciate the inestimable value of introspection in thepreservation of life,” he reflected. He even criticized most people for being so“absorbed in the contemplation of the outside world” that they “are whollyoblivious to what is passing on within themselves.”48 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-61]In addition to struggling with his thoughts, Tesla struggled to manage hishealth. One relative after another offered home cures to beef up his frail body.(Later in life, however, Tesla showed surprising agility and energy.) At the ageof fourteen, in 1870, not long after completing his studies at the GospicGymnasium, Tesla became “prostrated with a dangerous illness or rather, a scoreof them,” and he wrote, “my condition became so desperate that I was given up byphysicians.” To recuperate, he focused even more intently on reading, with thelocal librarian supplying scores of books, including the early works of MarkTwain (who became a good friend some twenty-five years later).During this period, world events encouraged young Serbian men to seek newopportunities. As noted before, the Turks won a great battle on the Plains ofKosovo and dominated the Serbs for centuries. In 1869, the Austrian emperoradded to their misery by retracting many of the scant privileges still enjoyedby Serbian peasants. As a result, many Serbs, including Tesla, began looking fora way out.When Tesla regained his strength, Milutin sent him to Karlovac (Carlstadt) inorder to prepare for the seminary and attend the Higher Real Gymnasium, thenineteenth-century European equivalent of a middle school that prepared brightstudents for university. Tesla lived there for three years with Aunt Stanka, hisfather’s sister, and Uncle Brankovic, a rugged colonel in the military, whomTesla considered “an old war horse.”49 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-62] They offered theyoung student “an atmosphere of refinement and artistic taste quite unusual forthose times and conditions,”50 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-63] but they also requiredrestraint. “I was fed like a canary bird,” Tesla complained. “When the Colonelwould put something substantial on my plate she would snatch it away and sayexcitedly to him: ‘Be careful, Niko is very delicate.’ I had a voraciousappetite and suffered like Tantalus.”51 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-64]Tesla, in fact, was prone to disease, and he contracted malaria in the low andmarshy Karlovac, which is positioned at the confluence of four rivers. Despitedrinking enormous quantities of quinine, he suffered for months.Academically, Tesla, like his father and Uncle Josip, excelled at mathematics,and he completed the four-year curriculum in three years, graduating in 1873. Hewas particularly motivated by the school’s physics instructor, Martin Sekulic,who designed his own models, including a radiometer featuring four tinfoil vanesthat spun within a vacuum when struck by a bright light. The fascinated studentdeclared, “It is impossible for me to convey an adequate idea of the intensityof feeling I experienced in witnessing his exhibitions of these mysteriousphenomena. Every impression produced a thousand echoes in my mind. I wanted toknow more of this wonderful force.”52 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-65]Tesla, however, would not master freehand drawing, despite its being obligatoryfor engineering students. He imagined designs in his head, stubbornly refusingto put pen to paper. Being left-handed didn’t help since drafting materialstended to be designed for righties. He found sketching to be “an annoyance Icould not endure” even though he admitted his shortcomings and refusals were “aserious handicap . . . (that) threatened to spoil my whole career.”53[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-66] (Several years later, he willed himself to beambidextrous, but he still disliked sketching complex designs, which promptedchallenges to his patent applications.)While at the Gymnasium, which he deemed a “fairly well equipped institution,”Tesla directed his wandering imagination to create innovative—although not veryuseful—devices. Obsessed with building a flying machine that would “achieve whatno other mortal had ever attempted,” the immodest student theorized that avacuum inside a cylinder would provide enough power to turn a shaft andpropeller. He actually constructed a wooden box within which he arranged for airpressure to be “exerted at a tangent to the surface of the cylinder—a situationhe knew would be required in order to produce rotation.”54[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-67] Tesla became “delirious with joy” when the shaft began tospin, but it wouldn’t accelerate. Only after numerous adjustments did he realize“atmospheric pressure acted at right angles to the surface of the cylinder” andthat the slight spinning resulted only from a small leak in the cylinder. “Thothis knowledge came gradually,” he admitted, “it gave me a painful shock.”55[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-68] (The failure wasn’t lost on him, though. This experiencewith air leaking into a vacuum and causing a small amount of motion promptedTesla later to build a pioneering and efficient bladeless turbine.)At seventeen, in 1873, Tesla “turned seriously to invention” with increasedsuccess. He had long practiced working things out in his head, owing to therigors that his father imposed—performing elaborate calculations without puttingpen to paper and memorizing long passages—and the rewards his father withheld.These mental exercises enabled him to “visualize with the greatest facility,”and, unlike other engineering students, he claimed to need no drawings, models,or experiments. “When I get an idea,” he wrote, “I start at once building it upin my imagination. I change the construction, make improvements, and operate thedevice entirely in my mind. . . . Invariably my device works as I conceived thatit should, and the experiment comes out exactly as I planned it.”56[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-69]Logic, or a deep trust in reasoning, underpinned Tesla’s inventing. “There isscarcely a subject that cannot be mathematically treated,” he maintained, “andthe effects calculated or the results determined beforehand from the availabletheoretical and practical data.”57 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-70]His growing thrill with engineering conflicted with his parents’ persistentdesire for him to join the priesthood. Here’s another paradox in Tesla’s earlylife—a father devoted to religion while his son loved science. Although Teslaadmitted that “the mere thought of [joining the clergy] filled me with dread,”he was “resigned to the inevitable with aching heart.”58 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-71]The stress of it weakened him further, and the fragile Tesla succumbed to thecholera epidemic sweeping through Gospic, where he had returned after hisstudies in Karlovac in 1873. For nine months, he fell “into dropsy, pulmonarytrouble, and all sorts of diseases until finally my coffin was ordered.”59[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-72] He vomited for hours, lost dangerous amounts of fluidfrom persistent diarrhea, and revealed shriveled skin and sunken eyes. Withsevere muscle cramps, he could barely move; as he later explained, “My energywas completely exhausted, and for the second time I found myself at death’sdoor.” He was only seventeen years old.And yet the bedridden Tesla mustered the spunk to suggest to his frantic father,“Perhaps I may get well if you will let me study engineering.” Milutin pledgedto his only remaining son, “You will go to the best technical institution in theworld,” to which Tesla later remarked, “I knew that he meant it. A heavy weightwas lifted from my mind.”60 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-73] That relief, along with anherbal medicine that he described as “a bitter decoction of a peculiar bean,”revived him “like another Lazarus to the utter amazement of everyone.”61[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-74]Tesla, who could be dramatic, claimed numerous other youthful brushes withdeath, namely, to be “almost drowned a dozen times; was nearly boiled alive andjust missed being cremated. I was entombed, lost and frozen. I had hair-breadthescapes from mad dogs, hogs, and other wild animals.” He credited his survivalsto being the result of “enchantment,”62 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-75] and he gained asense of invulnerability. The cholera episode, however, had a lasting effect,prompting Tesla to fear germs and avoid contact with others; he would not shakehands, let alone enjoy intimate relations.As if disease and disaster were not enough, Tesla was also subject to bullieswho invaded his private space. “There was a tough in our town,” he explained,“who once thrashed a friend of mine because he parted his hair in the middle,and I henceforth resolved to do the same. I received likewise a thrashing which,for thoroughness, left nothing to be desired.” The bully repeated these beatingsfor at least a year every time Tesla came home from school. Tesla, however,taught himself to box (which led to his later friendships with pugilists) and heeventually “had the satisfaction of returning the favors.” They apparentlysparred several times, yet just as Tesla “was about beginning to enjoy theexperiences,” he added in a macabre tone, “the fellow was shot in a brawl.”63[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-76]Another obstacle was the army, which expected young men in its territories toserve for three years. Some accounts have Milutin deciding his now-recovered sonshould hide in the mountains, yet it’s hard to imagine how Tesla, particularlywith numerous military officers in his family, could avoid the servicerequirement, and there seems to be no official record of any deferment. PerhapsMilutin convinced his brothers to use their connections to have Tesla avoidconscription. The only comment Tesla made about this gap in his biography wasthat his father insisted he “spend a year undertaking healthy physical outdoorexercise,” to which Tesla claims he “reluctantly consented.” Whatever thereason, beginning in the early fall of 1874, Tesla disappeared, went intohiding, and spent nine months roaming the hills of Croatia “loaded with ahunter’s outfit and a bundle of books.”64 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-77] He lateradmitted, “This contact with nature made me strong in body as well as inmind.”65 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-78] Such physical exercise contrasted with Tesla’searly feebleness and almost exclusive focus on mental exercise.The solitude also sparked some impractical scientific theories. Tesla came tobelieve, for instance, that he could use hydraulic pressure to shoot sphericalcontainers of packages and letters through a pipe under the ocean. He didn’trealize then that as the container’s velocity increased so did the resistance itfaced from the pipe walls. Another scheme he proposed was to improve passengertravel by placing giant rings around and above the earth and deploying enoughreactionary forces to keep them stationary as the planet rotated. Travelers, hethought, could move up to a ring, jump on and watch the spinning planet rotateat about a thousand miles per hour, wait for their preferred destination, andthen descend back to earth.While Tesla wandered the mountains, his father secured for him a scholarship andacceptance to the Joanneum Polytechnic School, which Tesla considered to be “oneof the oldest and best reputed institutions.”66 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-79] The youngstudent headed off to Graz, Austria, in the fall of 1875, carrying a colorfulshoulder bag his mother had embroidered and which he treasured the rest of hislife.Having dreamed for years of attending an engineering school, Tesla became aserious student, working from three in the morning to eleven at night, includingSundays and holidays. In addition to science, he tackled languages andvoraciously read the classics, including Shakespeare, Goethe, and Spenser. Suchefforts took him to the top of his class, where he passed through nine exams,nearly twice the requirement, and obtained numerous certificates. Tesla alsodeveloped “a verifiable mania for finishing whatever I began,” which includedreading the entire works of Voltaire, even though “to my dismay, there wereclose on one hundred large volumes in small print which that monster had writtenwhile drinking 72 cups of black coffee per day.”67 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-80]Tesla’s favorite lecturer was the physics professor Jacob Poeschl. Althoughconsidered “peculiar,” as evidenced by his allegedly wearing the same coat fortwenty years and because of his “enormous feet and hands,” Poeschl demonstrated“perfection of his exposition.” According to his eager student, “I never saw himmiss a word or gesture, and his demonstrations and experiments came off withclocklike precision.”68 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-81]This “methodical and thoroughly-grounded German” introduced Tesla to the seriousstudy of electricity, as well as to the latest scientific equipment. In early1877 the Polytechnic School acquired from Paris a Gramme generator, essentiallya large horseshoe-shaped magnet that surrounded a hollow cylinder encased intightly wrapped wire. This generator, when powered by a steam engine, enabledstudents to obtain reliable electricity rather than depend on expensivebatteries or the erratic currents from early dynamos.Building on the work of Hippolyte Fontaine of the Gramme ­Company, Poeschlsought to demonstrate how electricity could be transmitted to where it wasneeded in order to run lights or motors. Connecting the generator to a motor,however, required painstaking adjustments of a commutator, a device that shiftedelectricity from its regular alternating state (similar to a sine curve inmathematics) into a single path of flow, or a direct current. The cumbersomecommutator consisted of a metallic cylinder whose segments were insulated fromeach other and whose wire brushes, or stationary contacts on opposite sides ofthe cylinder, ensured the current from the generator moved in the samedirection.The commutator proved to be at the center of the direct-current versusalternating-current debate. Electricity usually is generated in bursts when acoil revolves around a magnet, passing the positive pole and then the negativepole. Those bursts switch directions very rapidly, first going clockwise,stopping, and then reversing themselves to go counterclockwise. Believing powerneeded to be in a direct continuous circuit (DC), early engineers devised acommutator to smooth out those bursts, allowing lights to avoid flickering andmotors to run smoothly. Unfortunately, the commutator proved to be inefficientand prone to sparking, and it limited power distribution to only several hundredfeet.(A history and description of electricity are in an appendix at the back of thisbook.)Tesla brashly decided problematic commutators needed to be eliminated, but thetradition-bound Poeschl declared flatly it could not be done. Tesla’s favoriteprofessor publicly rebuked him, saying that a commutator-less motor broke thelaws of nature. “Mr. Tesla may accomplish great things, but he certainly neverwill do this. It would be equivalent to converting a steadily pulling force,like that of gravity, into a rotary effort. It is a perpetual motion scheme, animpossible idea.”69 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-82]Tesla took Poeschl’s criticism as a challenge, trusting his own instincts morethan the professor’s experience. “For a time I wavered,” he wrote, impressed “bythe professor’s authority, but soon became convinced I was right and undertookthe task with all the fire and boundless confidence of youth.”70[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-83] Believing our brains have some “finer fibers” thatallowed us to “perceive truths which we could not attain through logicaldeductions,” he vowed to devise a system whereby a motor, using alternatingcurrent, would operate efficiently with a generator, and he became obsessed withsuch an ideal, working on it “incessantly.”71 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-84]While a sophomore at Joanneum Polytechnic, Tesla “had made up my mind to give myparents a surprise” of academic excellence, and his hard work and innateintelligence produced stellar results. Yet when Tesla went home at the end ofthe term expecting praise, Milutin criticized his son’s accomplishments and workhabits. The father’s renewed rejection punctured Tesla’s emergingself-confidence. (Only years later did Tesla discover a box of his father’spapers that included letters from several professors recommending that he relaxmore and avoid overexertion. Milutin, of course, could have informed his son ofsuch letters and encouraged him to take it easy, but he reverted todisapproval.)Milutin’s chastisement, according to Tesla, “almost killed my ambition.”72[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-85] The pupil, who had sought to be a professor ofmathematics and physics, began to question the value of studying so hard. By histhird year, beginning in the fall of 1877, Tesla took up gambling, a game ofchance, rather than further his mathematics, at which he excelled. He stoppedattending lectures and lost his scholarship. According to Tesla’s roommate, “Hebegan to stay late at the Botanical Garden, the students’ favorite coffee house,playing cards, billiards and chess, attracting a large crowd to watch hisskillful performances.”73 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-86] When they learned of hisdebauchery, Tesla’s “cousins, who had been sending him money, therefore withdrewtheir aid.” One day Tesla just disappeared, and “friends searched everywhere forhim and decided that he had drowned in the [Mur] river.”74[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-87]Without telling family or friends, Tesla had moved to Maribor in what is nowSlovenia, about 185 miles from his parents in Graz. He worked during the day ina tool and die shop and spent evenings drinking and betting at the Happy Peasantpub. When a school friend finally located Tesla, he encouraged him to returnhome, yet Tesla nonchalantly responded, “I like it here; I work for an engineer,receive sixty forints a month, and can earn a little more for every completedproject.”75 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-88]Gambling, Tesla later admitted, became a “mania.” “To sit down to a game ofcards,” he wrote, “was for me the quintessence of pleasure.”76[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-89] He and his friends played for “very high stakes,” and“more than one of my companions gambled away the full value of his home.”Despite his mathematical skills, Tesla claimed “my luck was generally bad.”77[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-90]The schoolmate sent word to Tesla’s parents, prompting Milutin to travel toMaribor in March 1879 and confront his son. Tesla refused to return home andarrogantly responded, “Is it worthwhile to give up that which I would purchasewith the joys of Paradise?”78 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-91]The reactions of his parents differed substantially. Milutin, according toTesla, “led an exemplary life, and could not excuse the senseless waste of timeand money in which I indulged.” The father gave “vent to his anger and contempt”and returned home shattered. Tesla’s mother, however, took an alternative tact.“She understood the character of men,” he wrote later, “and knew that one’ssalvation could only be brought about through his own efforts.”Although Tesla told his father he could “stop whenever I please,” a few weekslater police arrested the gambling Tesla as a “vagrant” and deported him home toGospic. The heartbroken Milutin, shocked that his remaining son had become acriminal, grew seriously ill and died at the age of sixty on April 17, 1879.Tesla’s only comment on his father’s death was that the priest received a“funeral liturgy fit for a saint.”79 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-92] Still, althoughTesla felt his father never appreciated him, Milutin’s passing—particularlysince Tesla’s actions helped prompt it—must have been devastating.Tesla stayed in Graz and returned to gambling until his mother intervenedcreatively. Djuka gave Tesla a roll of bills and said, “Go and enjoy yourself.The sooner you lose all we possess the better it will be. I know that you willget over it.” Then she kissed her son. The strategy, a bit of a gamble itself,proved to be a conversion event. “I conquered my passion then and there,” Teslasaid. “I not only vanquished but tore it from my heart so as not to leave even atrace of desire.”80 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-93] (That is not exactly true. In fact,he enjoyed both cards and billiards when he later lived in Budapest and when heworked for Thomas Edison in the United States; a colleague recalled: “He playeda beautiful game. [Tesla] was not a high scorer, but his cushion shots displayedskill equal to that of a professional exponent of this art.”)81[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-94]Tesla tempered several other habits and passions, too. Having been an obsessivesmoker, burning fifteen or twenty big black cigars every day, he slowly realizedthe practice was damaging his health, so, according to Tesla, “my will asserteditself and I not only stopped but destroyed all inclination.” He gave up coffee,worried that it was leading to heart trouble, although he confessed thisparticular discipline proved most difficult. He later admitted these denialspreserved his life, but, more tellingly, he “derived an immense amount ofsatisfaction from what most men would consider privation and sacrifice.”82[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-95]During this period of grief and restraint, Tesla briefly returned to church,inspired by the solitude and rituals of Serbian Orthodox services. His fatherhad preached that the material universe possessed underlying laws—something hereferred to as “logos”—that humans could discover. In fact, searching for suchdivine or ideal principles was a way to praise God. These lessons may haveprompted Tesla to consider being an inventor as the best means of identifyingthat religious ideal as well as motivating him to find the ideal in hisinventions.At church, Tesla met the only person outside of his immediate family that heever admitted loving. Anna was “tall and beautiful [with] extraordinaryunderstandable eyes.” The two enjoyed long strolls through town and along theriver, where they exchanged stories and talked of a future in which he became anelectrical engineer and she raised a family. Tesla admitted, “I fell in love.”But the romance did not last, in large part because Tesla needed to “carry outmy father’s wish and continue my education.”83 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-96] Tesla leftAnna and the church behind in January 1880 for the university in Prague; the twoexchanged letters for a time, but their romance faltered and Anna soon marriedanother man.(Despite their breakup, Tesla and Anna kept in touch. Some twenty years later,when Tesla was thriving in New York City, she arranged for him to meet her son.The young man wanted to be a boxer, and Tesla, a fan of the sport, arranged forhim to attend a boxing school near ­Madison Square Garden. Although Tesla triedto nurture the novice boxer, Anna’s son rejected his advice and insisted on atough opponent for his first fight. To Tesla’s horror, the boy was quicklyknocked unconscious and died shortly thereafter in a hospital. According to oneaccount, “Tesla grieved for him as though he was his own son.”)84[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-97]There are so many odd—and unexplained—paradoxes associated with Tesla’srelationship to Anna. First, it’s hard to imagine this germophobe beingromantic. In fact, it’s surprising this isolated and self-focused man could evenfall in love with another person. Noting Milutin’s persistent rejection of hisson’s engineering interests, it’s also remarkable Tesla used his father’s “wish”as an excuse to separate from the love of his life. Finally, you would haveexpected more words from Tesla about the death of the young boxer, who was theclosest he would ever come to having a son.When Tesla arrived at the Karl-Ferdinand University, Prague was part of Bohemia.He found the “old and interesting city was favorable to invention” in partbecause “hungry artists were plentiful and intelligent company could be foundeverywhere.”85 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-98] His mother had convinced her brothers,Petar and Pavle Mandic, to temporarily support Tesla’s studies. He attendedlectures that summer in philosophy, mathematics, and experimental physics. Sincehe did not want to study Greek or Czech, the required language classes, heparticipated as an unofficial auditor. Tesla devoted most of his time toconsidering designs for an electric motor at the Klementinum Library and thePeople’s Café.In order to curtail the motor’s sparking, Tesla tried detaching the commutatorfrom the motor and placing it on separate supports from the frame. Yetincreasing the distance between the rotor and the commutator yielded nobreakthrough. “Every day I imagined arrangements on this plan without result,but feeling that I was nearing a solution.”86 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-99]Knowing his uncles’ generosity was limited, Tesla “became a very fair example ofhigh thinking and plain living,” but he made up his mind to pursue his idealmotor.87 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-100] When the local newspaper reported that ThomasEdison was building a telephone exchange in Budapest, he asked his uncle Pavleto recommend him to Ferenc Puskas, who was supervising the Edison project andhad served with Pavle in the ­Hussars, a light cavalry unit. In January 1882,Tesla moved to Budapest, the capital of Hungary, where he found both employmentand inspiration."},{"pageContent":"2. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch2]A GLORIOUS DREAM [06_Contents.xhtml#ch2]BudapestElectricity fascinated and confused Tesla. Nineteenth-century physicistshypothesized that it moved mysteriously through ether, a medium that theythought permeated the atmosphere and outer space. Even now, when we understandthe composition and properties of atoms, as well as how electrons behave, mostscientists consider electricity a mysterious, versatile marvel that enableslighting, heating, motors, transport, communications, and computation.Electricity is unique among the many material sources of power. We can see waterrush over a wheel and turn paddles. Kerosene fills a lamp and ignites with amatch. Natural gas is invisible but still a state of matter, which can becaptured and measured out. In contrast, electricity must be generated; it is aphysical effect—rather than a solid, liquid, or gas—occurring through the wiresthat conduct it.Biographer Edmund Morris described electricity as “that fundamental force thatlights our nights and floods our nanocircuits.” It’s “easy enough to see andfeel what it does,” he wrote, “but when electricity isn’t going someplace, ithas no color, no character.”1 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-101]Since electricity does not exist naturally in quantities that can be manipulatedfor our benefit, producing and controlling this wonder has been an ongoingstruggle. Inventors, engineers, entrepreneurs, and businesses have all gotten inon the act. But Tesla’s advances, which began in Budapest, were key. Electricalpower became the foundation for our modern society largely because of hisinventions. (A more detailed review of electricity’s history and properties canbe found in the appendix.)images [Images/com.jpg]The Puskas brothers, friends of Tesla’s uncle and successful ­Europeanentrepreneurs, proved to be vital early supporters of both Edison and Tesla.Tivadar had met Thomas Edison a few years before at the inventor’s laboratory.Tivadar impressed the Wizard of Menlo Park with his fancy car, wads of cash, anddeep interest in the telegraph and telephone. The two agreed that the Puskasfamily, considered part of Transylvanian nobility, would promote Edison’sphones, electric lights, and phonographs in Europe. The Puskas started in Parisby creating a telephone network linking hundreds of subscribers via a singleswitchboard, an improvement over the private lines connecting just twolocations. They moved back home in late 1879 to do the same in Budapest.Ferenc Puskas couldn’t hire Tesla until he had arranged financing for the newproject. So Tesla took a low-paying job with the Central Telegraph Office of theHungarian government, where despite winning praise from the inspector-in-chief,he spent most of his time climbing poles to repair equipment, as well as doingroutine drafting and calculations. Although Budapest was cultured andcosmopolitan compared to Smilijan or even Gospic, Tesla slept in a smallapartment and, earning a meager salary of five dollars each week, lacked theresources to enjoy the city’s café society. Still, he relished long walks alongthe Danube River and through Budapest’s great parks with their fountains andlakes. Bored at work, however, he quit the telegraph job in order to concentrateon inventing, but the novice scientist did not attract any financial backers.The stress of his own uncertain future caught up with Tesla in Budapest, wherehe “suffered a complete breakdown of the nerves.” His fevered body shook and hispulse soared to 250 beats per minute. ­Perhaps hallucinating, he observed that“all the tissues of my body quivered with twitchings and tremors. A flyalighting on a table in the room would cause a dull thud in my ear. A carriagepassing at a distance of a few miles fairly shook my whole body. The whistle ofa locomotive twenty or thirty miles away made the bench or chair on which I satvibrate so strongly that the pain became unbearable.” Even in a dark room, Teslaclaimed he “could detect the presence of an object at a distance of twelve feetby a peculiar creepy sensation on the forehead.” A doctor “pronounced my maladyunique and incurable,” Tesla noted affectedly. “I clung desperately to life butnever expected to recover.”2 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-102]Later, Tesla regretted not being “under the observation of experts in physiologyand psychology at that time.” Although he claimed his hearing and sight were“always extraordinary,” the emerging scientist believed doctors could havelearned from his acute condition in Budapest.Tesla usually ascribed any positive turns to his own remarkable willpower, yethe credited this recovery from deep depression to Anthony Szigeti, a formerclassmate and talented engineer who joined him in Budapest. Tesla proclaimedSzigeti “a remarkable specimen” whose body “might have served for a statue ofApollo.” While Tesla’s friend was not handsome—he had a lump on his head and asallow complexion—he was “an athlete of extraordinary physical powers” whodragged the sickly Tesla through physical exercise. According to Tesla, “Hesaved my life.”3 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-103]The two friends played billiards together and spent each evening eating atlively cafés and walking along the Danube River or through Varosliget, the majorcity park that featured a famous castle. They developed a friendly competitionover who could drink the most milk, a contest Szigeti won after thethirty-eighth bottle.4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-104] According to Tesla, Szigeti gavehim a “powerful desire to live and to continue the work.”5[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-105] Tesla’s health slowly returned, as did “the vigor of mymind.”6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-106] Tesla swore he would make a gradual butsubstantial transformation from being “so helpless a physical wreck” to being “aman of strength and tenacity.”7 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-107]The recovered Tesla spent most of his waking hours focused on devising acommutator-less motor, trying to prove Professor Poeschl wrong. He reviewedarticles and performed numerous calculations, but mostly he imagined. “I startedby first picturing in my mind a direct-current machine, running it and followingthe changing flow of the currents in the rotor. Then I would imagine analternator [an AC generator] and investigate the processes taking place in asimilar manner. Next I would visualize systems comprising motors and generatorsand operate them in various ways. The images I saw were to me perfectly real andtangible.”8 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-108]Once again, the work became an obsession. “With me it was a sacred vow, aquestion of life or death,” he commented later. “I knew that I would perish if Ifailed.”9 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-109]During one of his evening strolls with Szigeti in February 1882, Teslaexperienced his eureka moment with respect to the electric motor. The inventorwas reciting poetry, having the capacity to recall “entire books by heart, wordfor word.”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-110] As the sun set, he turned to Goethe’sFaust.The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soilUpon its track to follow, follow soaring!Then would I see eternal Evening gildThe silent world beneath me glowing,On fire each mountain-peak, with peace each valley filled,The silver brook to golden rivers flowing.The mountain-chain, with all its gorges deep,Would then no more impede my godlike motion.11 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-111]While Tesla uttered these stanzas, “the idea came like a flash of lightning andin an instant the truth was revealed.” He grabbed a stick and quickly drew adiagram in the sand of an innovative motor that ­utilized a rotating magneticfield. “The images were wonderfully sharp and clear and had the solidity ofmetal and stone,” he said, “so much so that I told (Szigeti): ‘See my motorhere; watch me reverse it.’ ”12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-112]Years later the dramatic Tesla recounted the experience to the equally dramaticJohn O’Neill, the inventor’s first biographer: “Isn’t it beautiful? Isn’t itsublime? Isn’t it simple? I have solved the problem. Now I can die happy. But Imust live. I must return to work and build the motor so I can give it to theworld. No more will men be slaves to hard tasks. My motor will set them free. Itwill do the work of the world.”13 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-113]Said with less flourish, Tesla had figured out how to create a motor that couldutilize the undulating electrical rhythms of the more powerful alternatingcurrent. Discovering this rotating magnetic field could be considered theelectrical correspondent of producing the wheel. A reporter with the New YorkHerald Tribune later explained Tesla’s accomplishment as: “Up to this timeeveryone who tried to make an alternating current motor used a singlecircuit. . . . What Tesla did was to use two circuits, each one carrying thesame frequency of alternating current, but in which the current waves were outof step with each other. This was the equivalent of adding to an engine a secondcylinder. . . . [These alternating currents created] a rotating magnetic field[that] possessed the property of transferring wirelessly through space, by meansof its lines of force, energy.”14 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-114]Tesla described his rotating magnetic field as “a sort of magnetic cyclone whichgrips the rotable part [of the motor] and whirls it.”15 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-115]Late in life, he called this invention the closest one to his heart. “It was notonly a valuable discovery, capable of extensive practical applications,” hesaid. “It was a revelation of new forces and new phenomena unknown to sciencebefore.”16 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-116]The maverick inventor relished upending standard practices. It was almost aquixotic quest for Tesla. While other engineers working on analternating-current motor used a single circuit, Tesla utilized two circuitsthat generated dual currents ninety degrees out of phase with each other. Whenone current reached its maximum, the other had a zero value, creating a magneticfield that spun a piece of iron. Instead of churning up useless vibrations,Tesla’s rotating magnetic field produced a turning force, as well as suggestedrevolutionary properties. Until Tesla, no one imagined a magnetic field couldprovoke rotation. As explained by a scientific historian, “The net effect wasthat a receiving magnet [or motor armature], by means of induction, would rotatein space and thereby continually attract a steady stream of electrons whether ornot the charge was positive or negative.”17 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-117]Rather than change the magnetic poles in the rotor, the part of the motor thatrotates, Tesla also decided to change them in the stator, the motor’s stationarycomponent. As a separate science historian noted, “Tesla saw that if themagnetic field in the stator rotated, it would induce an opposing magnetic fieldin the rotor and thus cause the rotor to turn.”18 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-118]At times in his life, Tesla described men, even himself, as automatons thatsimply react passively to the world around them. “I was but an automaton devoidof free will in thought and action,” he wrote in 1919, “and merely responsive tothe forces of the environment.”19 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-119] Yet that evening inBudapest, and on numerous other occasions, the proactive Tesla inventedsomething completely new, or as he described it, he obtained insights bywrestling with nature “against all odds, and at the peril of my existence.”20[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-120]Despite Tesla’s bragging that he could visualize entire machines and systemsthat worked exactly as he planned, the alternating-current motor required yearsof testing and adjustments. As evidence that he might have practiced a bit ofrevisionist history when he later recalled the revelation in the park, Tesla didnot mention the eureka moment when he applied for a patent, and Szigeti saidnothing about the Budapest experience during his patent-defense testimony in1889.21 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-121]Tesla’s motor, which embodied totally new principles rather than refinements ofexisting work, represented a technological breakthrough that soon changed theworld. It dramatically expanded the potential market for electricity, allowingit to be sold not just at night for lighting but also during the day forfactories, appliances, and streetcar lines. For the first time, alternatingcurrent could be pumped hundreds of miles and efficiently power machines as wellas lamps.When demonstrating modesty, Tesla described his achievement simply: “A magnet,as it is well known, will attract a piece of wire and hold it. It was my goodfortune to discover a method of constructing a magnet in such a way that itwould not hold the iron, but spin it round and round.”22 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-122]Put another way, he figured out the difference between lifting and levitating anobject.With this innovation, Tesla had overcome the taunts from Jacob Poeschl, hisformer physics professor at the Polytechnic School in Graz, that acommutator-less motor was impossible. At only twenty-seven years old, hisself-confidence soared, and he boasted: “I had carried out what I had undertakenand pictured myself achieving wealth and fame.” More importantly, hedemonstrated to himself that he had become an inventor, “the one thing I wantedto be.”23 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-123] “The inventor,” he boasted, “gives to theworld creations which are palpable, which live and work.”24[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-124]Tesla in Budapest revealed a unique inventing style. Few discoverers quotedpoets while drawing diagrams in the sand. Few approached creating so cerebrally.Inventing became Tesla’s purpose and he perceived it as noble. “The progressivedevelopment of man is vitally dependent on invention,” he wrote. “It is the mostimportant product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the completemastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of natureto human needs.”25 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-125]A newly self-assured Tesla basked in the “intense enjoyment of picturingmachines and devising new forms.” Visions came at him in an uninterrupted streamand he experienced “a mental state of happiness as complete as I have ever knownin life.” The cerebral engineering—when “the only difficulty I had was to hold[the ideas] fast”—allowed him to conceive of apparatuses, including dynamos andtransformers, that were to him “absolutely real and tangible in every detail,even to the minutest marks and signs of wear.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-126] He evenenvisioned his motor operating on three or more alternating currentssimultaneously, what he described as a poly-phase system.Still, Tesla’s visions needed to be converted into working devices, so theinventor decided to visit Ganz and Company. This Budapest factory, which hadbegun as an iron foundry making wheels for railway cars, had recently convertedto constructing electrical equipment that powered arc and incandescent lights.There the young Serb became intrigued with a ring transformer—essentially alarge iron loop ­encircled by two coils—that had been discarded in a corner ofthe workshop. Perhaps playfully or maybe with insight, Tesla placed a ball atopthe device—and it began to wobble. He concluded the windings in the two coilsproduced two alternating currents, which created a rotating magnetic field thatturned the ball, thus confirming his visualization for an alternating-currentmotor capable of performing all kinds of work.Tesla was not the only scientist investigating rotating magnetic fields. Threeyears earlier, Walter Baily had demonstrated the principle before the PhysicalSociety of London, and Galileo Ferraris had designed an AC system in Turin,Italy. Tesla actually acknowledged it was “not new to produce the rotation of amotor by intermittently changing the poles of one of its elements,” but he alonediscovered “the model or method of utilizing such currents.”27[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-127] A U.S. judge eventually declared Baily’s ideas to be“impractical abstractions,”28 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-128] and Professor Ferrarisadmitted, “Tesla developed it much further than [I] did.”29[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-129]Tesla’s need for income eventually overwhelmed his glorious but uncompensatedvisions, so he joined Ferenc Puskas when construction began of the Edisontelephone exchange in Budapest. The young inventor worked diligently, evendeveloping an innovative conical-shaped amplifier or repeater, a precursor ofthe loudspeaker. Tesla never patented the ingenious device, although he laterbragged that its originality compared to his better-known inventions. Once theexchange became operational, Ferenc sold it, and his brother, Tivader, invitedTesla and Szigeti to come to Paris in late 1882 to help install an Edisonelectric lighting system.The previous year, Edison had amazed cosmopolitan Parisians with a light displayat the Electrical Exposition. He installed within the vast exhibit hall aworking lighthouse, jumbo generators, and a brilliant collection of five hundredincandescent lamps of sixteen candlepower each. About electricity, one baffledFrenchman wrote: “We are not yet in the habit of observing machines thatfunction without apparent cause. Their occult workings baffle us. The secret oftheir existence escapes us.”30 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-130] Although confused byelectricity’s actual workings, the impressed French conferred the Legiond’Honneur on Edison.Tesla enjoyed his time in Paris, a city he called “magic.” He spent his firstdays roaming “through the streets in utter bewilderment of the new spectacle.”The dining and drinking attractions, he said, “were many and irresistible,” butthe income, he lamented, “was spent as soon as received.” In fact, when Puskasasked how he was getting along, Tesla replied, “The last twenty-nine days of themonth are the toughest!”31 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-131]The young Serbian engineer rented a room on Boulevard St. ­Marcel, on the edgeof the picturesque Latin Quarter filled with students and professors. Teslarelished his morning routines, swimming twenty-seven laps (divisible by three)at a bathhouse on the Seine, devouring “a woodchopper’s breakfast” at half pastseven o’clock, and walking a half hour to the southeast in order to reach hiswork at the Ivry-sur-Seine lamp factory recently built by Compagnie ContinentaleEdison. His evenings were devoted to wandering the gaslit avenues, enjoying thenew electric lighting that he helped install at the gilded Paris Opera, andplaying billiards with his co-workers.32 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-132] He also savoredParisian nightlife; one evening the famous actress Sarah Bernhardt dropped herscarf near his dining table, which prompted an intense and flirty conversation.The two subsequently met on a few occasions in Paris and New York, although thehandsome inventor claimed the relationship was platonic. Still, Tesla savedBernhardt’s scarf, without washing it, his entire life.Once again drawing in the dirt with a stick, Tesla showed some Edison men hisvision for an AC motor that utilized several alternating currents. “My idea,” hesaid, “was that the more wires I used the more perfect would be the action ofthe motor.”33 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-133] Yet the pragmatic and cost-consciousEdison engineers scoffed at the scientist’s ideal, complaining copper wires werethe most expensive part of an electrical distribution system; they wanted less,not more, wiring.Still, the Paris assignment allowed Tesla to gain practical experience withexisting designs for dynamos and motors. The Edison Company, meanwhile, profitedfrom Tesla’s mathematical training and his ability to complete complexcalculations, such as the best length and diameter for a motor’s coils. Tesladeveloped an innovative automatic regulator that enhanced the performance ofEdison’s dynamo, and he traveled to install lighting systems at Berlin cafés anda Bavarian theatre. He also advanced arc lighting along the Avenue de l’Opéraand other streets, helping to transform Paris into the City of Light.Viewing the young scientist as their new problem solver, Edison executives senthim in February 1883 to the Strasbourg railway station. During a dedicationceremony with German Emperor Wilhelm I, the lighting system had short-circuitedand exploded. With his ability to speak German and French, Tesla tackled thecomplex setup of four direct-current generators and 1,200 incandescent lamps, aswell as five alternating-current generators and sixty arc lights. He determinedthe problem to be defective wiring within the underground conduits, which were arelatively new way to string electric lines.While in Strasbourg for almost twelve months, Tesla and Szigeti made time atnight to focus on their AC motor, working out of a closet in order to ensuresecrecy. They were after, as Tesla stated, “the simplest motor I could conceiveof . . . [having] only one circuit and no windings on the armature or thefields.”34 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-134] When their initial design did not work, thetwo engineers began fiddling. They tried iron and then steel instead of brasswithin the stator’s core, and then they positioned by trial and error a steelbar so its magnetic field repelled the induced currents and caused the disk torotate. By the summer’s end, a satisfied Tesla boasted to have “finally had thesatisfaction of seeing rotation effected by alternating currents of differentphase, and without sliding contacts or commutator—all as I had conceived a yearbefore.”35 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-135]Tesla consistently claimed to complete his inventing in his brain. Later inlife, he explained his creative process: “In my work, I first get a ‘feeling’that there is a solution to a problem. This feeling means a great deal to me,for when I get it I always succeed eventually in working out the problem.Probably it is an indication that the subconscious mind is diligently on thetrack or has already found a solution. Then I think generally over the problems,not concentrating on any one point. I may go for months, or even years, with anidea in such a state in the back of my head. Finally I close around on the idea,and the image that was at first blurred gets sharper and sharper—until in timeit becomes a reality. After the general form is ascertained, I proceed toperfect the machine or idea—decide whether one thing or another will improve it.The vision is so clear that I can tell if a certain part is out of balance! Andfinally I can give exact measurements to the workmen without having made even asketch. The models are not to experiment with, but are built simply to prove theideas were created in my mind.”36 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-136]That’s an exaggeration; Tesla spent hours tinkering with different models ofmotors and later admitted his initial ideas often needed adjustments before theybecame practical devices. Still, his inventing style was unique, a product ofhis vivid imagination and powers of memorization, and it differed substantiallyfrom Thomas Edison’s empirical process. To obtain pleasing indoor illumination,unlike the blazing and ugly glare from arc lights, Edison tested hundreds offilaments, from cotton to platinum, before settling on an incandescent bulbcomposed of a thin wire of carbon within a vacuum tube.Tesla tried to secure financing in Strasbourg to develop his AC motor. Heattracted the attention of a former mayor who approached several wealthybusinessmen, but in the end, no one was willing to finance an unproven inventorand a revolutionary design whose operation and value they did not understand.The best Tesla obtained was a fine bottle of St. Estephe wine of 1801, which themayor had buried when the Germans had invaded the country in 1870.Tesla also obtained little from the Edison Company, which he believed hadpromised him a bonus if he solved the Strasbourg train station mystery. What hegained was an introduction to corporate bureaucracy, where one administratorafter another suggested someone else was the decider. “After several laps ofthis circulus vivios,” a cynical Tesla finally concluded, “it dawned upon methat my reward was a castle in Spain.”37 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-137]Charles Batchelor—Thomas Edison’s closest advisor, a master electrician, anddirector of the Edison companies in France—subsequently invited the inventor totravel to New York, meet the Wizard of Menlo Park, and improve the dynamos beingdeveloped at the Edison Machine Works. Without many European options to advancehis alternating-current research, Tesla decided to try his fortunes in “the landof Golden Promise.”38 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-138] Tivadar Puskas encouraged thetransition and addressed a letter to his friend Edison, stating, “I know twogreat men and you are one of them; the other is this young man.”39[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-139]"},{"pageContent":"3. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch3]REVERBERATION OF HEAVEN’S ARTILLERY [06_Contents.xhtml#ch3]New YorkTesla’s journey to America proved rough. He lost his wallet and ticket on hisway to the dock and needed to recite from memory the voucher’s eleven-digitnumber, berth location, and even the first mate’s name in order for the agent toallow him aboard. The voyage itself presented “a mutiny in which I nearly lostmy life”1 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-140] as burly sailors protested filthy beds, thelack of clean water, and roaming rats. Tesla, however, spent most of his time“at the stern of the ship watching for an opportunity to save somebody from awatery grave.”2 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-141]Tesla arrived in New York City in early June 1884 on the City of ­Richmond. Hecarried little with him, only “remnants of my belongings, some poems andarticles I had written, and a package of calculations relating to solutions ofan unsolvable integral and to my flying machine.”3 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-142] Heclaimed his financial resources totaled only four cents.When Tesla set foot in Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty was under constructionand Thomas Edison’s first electric generating plant had opened on Pearl Streettwo years earlier. Like thousands of other immigrants—Germans, Italians, Irish,and Scandinavians—Tesla arrived with dreams. The United States, however, did notpresent the young immigrant with positive first impressions. Before Ellis Islandopened in 1892, immigrants came into Manhattan’s Castle Clinton depot, a gloomyformer fort at the southern tip of Manhattan Island. One customs officermisunderstood the new arrival and recorded Tesla’s place of birth as Sweden(rather than Smiljan), while another immigration official barked “Kiss theBible. Twenty cents!”4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-143] A burly policeman, perhaps angryat the growing wave of Eastern European immigrants, twirled his stick, which“looked to me as big as a log,” and delivered directions “with murder in hiseye.” Tesla recalled asking himself, “Is this America? . . . It is a centurybehind Europe in civilization.”5 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-144] Noting the absence ofbroad boulevards and public gardens, he further observed: “What I had left wasbeautiful, artistic, and fascinating in every way; what I saw here was machined,rough, and unattractive.”Yet America offered the new immigrant opportunity in the first few blocks. Whilewalking uptown on that pleasant Friday, Tesla encountered the foreman of a smallmachine shop who was trying to repair “an electric machine of European make.”The man had given up the task as hopeless, but Tesla undertook the challenge,stating, “It was not easy, but I finally had it in perfect running condition.”Although not expecting any compensation, Tesla claimed to have received from theforeman twenty dollars, a substantial sum (the equivalent of more than fivehundred dollars today) compared to the four pennies in his pocket. He expressedhis wish “that I had come to America years before.”6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-145]Five years later, he declared the United States “was more than one hundred yearsahead of Europe.”7 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-146]Tesla had been working for several years for Edison’s companies, and on hissecond day in the United States, the twenty-eight-year-old immigrant actuallymet thirty-seven-year-old Thomas Edison. What Tesla described as “a memorableevent in my life” was also an immediate clash of personalities and cultures.8[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-147] Although essentially broke, Tesla wore an immaculatebowler hat and white gloves. With a slim build and deep-set eyes, he presentedhimself as a worldly gentleman who spoke several languages fluently. Edison, incontrast, was frumpy and grumpy, about five inches shorter, and his English,muddled by chewing tobacco, revealed a Midwestern drawl.The Edison headquarters at 65 Fifth Avenue reflected the young company’sconfidence and practicality. Located in an impressive brownstone, the main floorfeatured sparkling electric chandeliers and lamps to impress potentialinvestors. Edison spent most of his time in a comfortable back office, reviewingpatent applications and smoking cigars. Since the expanding firm needed trainedmen, one floor served as a night school for fledgling engineers, while unmarriedemployees actually lived on the top floor.images [Images/com.jpg]As a youngster, Edison appeared destined to be neither prolific nor famous. Hedescended from a line of rebels. His grandfather, a prosperous Tory, foughtagainst George Washington, was convicted of treason, was sentenced to hang, andfled to Canada. His father also narrowly escaped, this time from Canada toMichigan after participating in an unsuccessful coup against the Royal Canadiangovernment.Thomas Alva Edison was born in February 1847 in Milan, Ohio, the family’sseventh and final child. Al, as he was called, spent his early years dreaming,drifting, and getting into trouble. Although possessing an encyclopedic memoryand vivid imagination, Edison performed poorly at his one-room school, with ateacher describing the student as “a little addled.” His mother eventuallyhomeschooled Al and nurtured his love of reading and science. “My mother was themaking of me,” Edison declared later, using words similar to Tesla’s for his ownmother. “She understood me. She let me follow my bent.”9 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-148]One of Edison’s first experiments created a spark that burned his father’s barnto the ground, yet his punishment in the public square failed to deter hispranks. He also shocked any friend or relative gullible enough to touch hiselectric generator.In his teens, Edison moved with his family to Port Huron, ­Michigan, where heproved to be a decent telegraph transmitter and adept tinkerer. At the age oftwenty-four, he settled in Newark, New Jersey, where, with growing confidence inhis own abilities, his dogged dabbling eventually produced useful products thatbrought him to the attention of industrialists and Wall Street financiers. Hisstock ticker, for instance, overcame many of the telegraph industry’sbottlenecks by operating at two hundred to three hundred words per minute, andhis automatic duplex allowed two messages to be sent simultaneously on a singlewire. His eventual list of discoveries reads like a litany of modern products:phonograph, motion picture camera, incandescent bulb, parallel circuit, andmimeograph machine.Unlike the isolated Tesla, Edison worked best when he cooperated with a team,yet he remained the lab’s driving force, whose persistence prompted continualexperimentation. He overflowed with ideas, yet his successes resulted more fromtrial and error than from envisioning finished products in his mind. The Wizardof Menlo Park fiddled, built scores of models, and tested hundreds of materials.As Edison himself put it: “Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percentperspiration.”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-149]The development of the incandescent lamp is illustrative. As noted brieflyabove, Edison tried almost every imaginable chemical (e.g., chromium,molybdenum, boron, silicon, and zirconium oxide) to coat almost every imaginablesubstance (e.g., fish lines, cotton, cardboard, wood shavings, bamboo, andbeards). He initially dismissed carbon as a possible “burner” because of itspresumed weakness when exposed to the 3,000-degree Fahrenheit heat of anelectric current, but he decided to bake carbonized sewing thread and to wirethe charred ribbon to a stem assembly within a globe. After his new pumpexhausted the bulb of its air, he turned on the electric current. The firsteight attempts produced only a broken thread, but on October 21, 1879, aslightly thicker thread burned for forty straight hours. It might have lastedlonger, yet Edison, ever the tinkerer, tested higher voltages until the filamentexpired.Edison even rejected Tesla’s trust in mathematics, bragging about notappreciating scientific theories. “At the time I experimented on theincandescent lamp I did not understand Ohm’s law,” admitted Edison. “Moreover, Ido not want to understand Ohm’s law. It would prevent me from experimenting.”11[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-150] (Understanding Ohm’s law, however, would have revealed acore problem with Edison’s direct-current approach, since the principle assertsthat the amount of electricity delivered, the current, is equal to voltagedivided by resistance; in other words, direct-current electricity—with its lowvoltages—requires heavy and expensive copper wire, faces resistance, can travelonly short distances, and is, therefore, limited in its applications to small,high-density areas.)While Tesla loved inventing for its own sake, Edison was first and foremost anentrepreneur. There was a clear purpose behind his experiments—to make money. Heunderstood and could navigate within the world of finance. In 1890, he and HenryVillard, a savvy investor and the force behind the Union Pacific Railroad,reorganized and capitalized at twelve million dollars the innovator’s variouscompanies into Edison General Electric.Despite their different styles and motivations, the two inventors shared severalcharacteristics, including their capacity for showmanship and boastfulness. OnSeptember 4, 1892, Edison scheduled the debut of his Pearl Street generatingstation, which he cleverly located near the stock exchange, major banking andfinancing houses, and leading newspapers. He knew that a successfuldemonstration would prompt brokers, bankers, and editors to advance hisfinancial success and fame. At precisely 3:00 p.m., an electrician threw theswitch that fed current from a Jumbo generator (named after the great elephantbrought to America by P. T. Barnum) to 106 lamps throughout Morgan’s office.Fifty-two additional bulbs glowed in the New York Times’ editorial office. Thenext day’s newspaper described the artificial light as “soft and mellow to theeye; it seemed almost like writing by daylight.”12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-151]Edison, obviously pleased with his performance, declared, “I’ve accomplished allI promised.”13 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-152]Both electrical wizards attracted skeptics as well. Professor Henry Morton ofthe Stevens Institute labeled Edison’s lamp “a conspicuous failure, trumpeted asa wonderful success. A fraud upon the public.” The London Times’ Sunday Reviewsuggested Edison’s results were based on trickery and declared, “There is astrong flavor of humbug about the whole matter.”14 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-153]The Menlo Park Wizard also had to battle the legal challenges of hiscompetitors. In part because Edison’s early applications were slipshod andchaotically drawn, patent commissioners in October 1883 ruled that WilliamSawyer’s incandescent lamp with a carbon filament preceded Edison’s. Theygranted Sawyer the legal monopoly to sell the lamp for the next seventeen years.Hiram Maxim, already the producer of the first portable fully automatic machinegun, tried to strengthen the fragile carbon filament by burning it within aSawyer bulb filled with hydrocarbon vapor. Commenting on this “flashingprocess,” ­Illustrated Science News predicted: “In connection with electricillumination [Maxim’s] name will be remembered long after that of his boastfulrival [Edison] is forgotten.”15 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-154]The pride and doggedness enabled both Tesla and Edison to triumph over thenaysayers and lawyers. Over the years, the two sometimes worked together andoften fought each other, but their stories and struggles reveal much about themaking of our modern economy.images [Images/com.jpg]Notwithstanding their awkward initial exchanges, Edison hired Tesla that sameafternoon to fix a lighting system aboard the SS Oregon, then the world’sfastest passenger liner and the first to use electric lighting. Tesla workedthrough the night to repair the short circuits and breaks in the ship’s dynamo.When walking home at five o’clock in the morning, he ran into Edison andBatchelor on Fifth Avenue, also leaving their work. The surprised Wizard ofMenlo Park listened silently to his new employee’s update, but, according toTesla, “when he walked some distance away I heard him remark: ‘Batchelor, thisis a damn good man,’ and from that time on I had full freedom in directing thework.”16 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-155] Edison quickly offered Tesla a job at hisMachine Works for eighteen dollars a week, where Tesla fixed incandescent andarc lamps and adjusted direct-current motors. In fact, Edison got far more thana talented mechanic. Within six months, Tesla had designed two dozen machinesthat replaced the less efficient versions used by the Edison companies, savingthe older inventor enormous sums of money.As it happened, Tesla shared Edison’s drive; they both thrived on work andneeded little rest. Edison was known to toil for days, taking only occasionalcatnaps on his office sofa or a tabletop, while Tesla’s working hours in theUnited States were ritualized and long, beginning at 10:00 a.m. one morning andgoing until 5:00 a.m. the next morning. (Tesla, even in old age, slept only twoto three hours a night.) Edison said of Tesla, “I have had many hard-workingassistants, but you take the cake.”17 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-156]The two inventors, however, were not equally sophisticated. ­Edison, in fact,could be downright crass. When, for instance, he could not locate Tesla’s smallvillage on a map, he assumed the Serb had grown up in an uncivilized land andasked, “Have you ever eaten human flesh?”18 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-157] The polishedand reserved Tesla was no doubt nonplussed.Tesla nonetheless worked tirelessly on Edison’s behalf. He tried to convinceEdison of AC’s advantages, suggesting it liberated the Edison systems from theshackles of their one-mile-radius limitation. According to Tesla, Edisonresponded “very bluntly that he was not interested in alternating current; therewas no future to it and anyone who ­dabbled in that field was wasting his time;and besides, it was a deadly current whereas direct current was safe.”19[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-158]The major rift between the inventors came after Tesla believed he’d been cheatedrather than overworked. When Tesla insisted that he could dramatically increasethe efficiency of Edison’s dynamos, his boss expressed skepticism, and then,according to Tesla, promised him fifty thousand dollars for success. That was alarge amount of money considering Edison’s reputation for stinginess and hiscompany’s own dire need for cash and capital. Tesla worked for six months untilhe discovered that shorter-core magnets yielded far more energy and tripled theMary-Ann dynamo’s output. Tesla had made good on his boast, but when he enteredEdison’s smoke-filled and cluttered office in early December 1884 asking to bepaid, the Wizard fell forward in laughter and declared his monetary offer hadbeen made in jest: “You are still a Parisian! When you become a full-fledgedAmerican you will appreciate an American joke.”No doubt Tesla should have recognized Edison’s exaggerations, yet he was stungby his hero laughing in his face, essentially mocking his accomplishment andmaking fun of immigrants. Tesla, in fact, had fixed Edison’s mistakes at theStrasbourg train station and on the SS Oregon, and he had vastly improvedEdison’s machines. Despite the boss’s subsequent offer of a raise of ten dollarsper week (a 55 percent increase), Tesla resigned, picked up his bowler hat, andwalked out. That evening Tesla scrawled in his notebook: “Good by [sic] to the­Edison Machine Works!”20 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-159]Not long after leaving Edison’s workshop, Tesla received a new offer. BenjaminVail, a town council member in Rahway, New Jersey, had long been fascinated withelectric lighting and wanted his village to be known for its moderntechnologies. He committed one thousand ­dollars and raised another fourthousand dollars from local businessmen to launch the Tesla Electric Light andManufacturing Company in late December 1884. Tesla moved into an apartment inLower Manhattan, where children regularly stole the colored glass balls he hadplaced on decorative sticks throughout his garden,21 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-160] andhe opened a small laboratory on Liberty Street that was surrounded by a bustlingwholesale food market.The scientist, expanding on the arc-lighting work he had done for Edison, toiledfor a year of “day and night application” to improve both generators and lamps,for which he obtained several patents that he assigned to the company inexchange for stock shares. By August 1886, the completed system lit Rahway’sstreets and powered its workshops. Rahway was featured on the front page ofElectrical Review, a trade journal, and the Tesla Electric Light andManufacturing Company advertised its system as “the most perfect Automatic,Self-regulating system of electric arc lighting yet produced . . . with noflickering or hissing.”22 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-161]Ultimately, Benjamin Vail, like Edison, took advantage of the inventor. Vaillost interest in manufacturing arc-lighting equipment, as that side of theoperation became dominated by the Brush and Thomson-Houston companies. Theexecutive instead preferred to focus on operating the Rahway system, whichdidn’t need Tesla’s expertise or inventions. As the company controlled Tesla’spatents, the scientist received no royalties, only “a beautifully engravedcertificate of stock of hypothetical value.”23 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-162] Tesladescribed the rejection as “the hardest blow I ever received. . . . I was forcedout of the company, losing not only all my interest but also my reputation as anengineer and inventor.”24 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-163] It would not be the last timeTesla was bested by a businessman.Virtually broke and without engineering job prospects, Tesla “lived through ayear of terrible heartaches and bitter tears, my suffering being intensified bymaterial want.” For many of those days he did not know “where my next meal wascoming from,” yet, “never afraid to work,” he approached a crew digging ditchesfor underground telephone and telegraph lines. Although the foreman initiallylaughed at his good clothes and white hands, Tesla claimed later, “I workedharder than anybody. At the end of the day, I had $2.”25 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-164]While Tesla (and thousands of other unemployed men) struggled during theeconomic recession of 1887–1888, Edison’s expanding company battled its ownemployees wanting better pay and conditions. At its New Jersey lamp factory, forinstance, eight filament workers joined a union and, according to Edison,“became very insolent, knowing that it was very impossible to manufacture lampswithout them.” The Menlo Park inventor responded by designing thirty machinesthat automated their tasks and then bragged: “The union went out. It has beenout ever since.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-165]Even in this dark period, Tesla could not stop imagining new machines. Hecompleted a patent application for a thermomagnetic motor that took advantage ofthe fact that iron magnets lose their magnetism when heated. Tesla’s motorfeatured a pivot arm that moved in and out of a flame, causing a flywheel tospin. The machine itself never proved to be profitable, but Tesla’sditch-digging foreman became impressed by the young man’s ingenuity andintroduced Tesla to Alfred Brown, superintendent of Western Union’s New YorkMetropolitan District. Brown was considered a “first class electrician andexpert in underground telegraph work.” He introduced Tesla to Charles Peck, apatent lawyer from Englewood, New Jersey, and secretary of the Mutual UnionTelegraph Company, which supplied and operated twenty-five thousand dedicatedtelecommunication lines in twenty-two states for banks wanting their dataexchanges secured.Peck and Brown offered the business acumen and temperament Tesla so desperatelyneeded. They ensured Tesla was grounded in reality, giving him license toimagine and invent. They understood how to finance companies, promote innovativetechnologies, and position inventions to receive the most publicity.Importantly, they also were honest and appreciated Tesla’s talents. According toTesla, “They were in all their dealings with me the finest and noblestcharacters I have ever met in my life.”27 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-166]Tesla, Peck, and Brown in April 1887 formed the Tesla Electric Company, with theinventor to receive a third of the profits, Peck and Brown to split a third, andthe final portion to be invested in developing new innovations. Tesla, moreover,obtained a monthly salary of $250 (the equivalent of about $78,000 annuallytoday) as well as access to a slightly larger laboratory in Manhattan’sfinancial district at 33–35 South Fifth Avenue (now West Broadway), not far fromEdison’s downtown office. Although furnished with only a stove, workbench, anddynamo, he relished his new engagement and struck a deal with the GlobeStationery & Printing Company, located on the ground floor, to obtain power atnight after Globe turned off its presses. Tesla and Szigeti, who landed in NewYork City in May 1887, also renewed their habits of strolling through parks,reciting poems, and discussing design options.Tesla promised to consider a variety of projects, not just an AC motor, and thenew firm quickly developed a commutator that reduced a dynamo’s sparking, aswell as a short-circuiting commutator that increased a DC motor’s efficiency.Tesla, however, focused most of his attention for almost a year on apyro-magnetic generator that aimed to convert the heat from burning coal intoelectricity with less waste. Tesla tried to alternately heat and then cool amagnet in order to directly induce a current in a conductor. This innovationbypassed the usual method, which was having coal-fired heat boil water toproduce steam to power an engine that spun the same dynamo, each step of whichwastes energy. Unfortunately, the inventor could not achieve sufficienttemperature differentials to provoke a current, and the patent office rejectedhis application.Tesla worried that Brown and Peck might abandon him, just as Vail had done inRahway. Yet Peck, the lawyer, showed faith in the inventor and saidcomfortingly, “Now do not be discouraged that this great invention of yours isnot panning out right; you may bring it to a success after all. Perhaps it wouldbe good if you would switch to some other of your ideas and drop this for awhile. I have had an experience that this is a very good plan.”28[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-167]Tesla shifted his attention back to his favorite idea from Budapest—an AC motorpowered by a rotating magnetic field—that he believed would help solve twochallenges facing electricity’s adoption. First, early power distributionpresented a dangerous and jumbled mess. Brooklyn residents became so familiarwith skirting the sparks from electric trolley tracks that they named theirbaseball team the Dodgers. Well before common standards, different wirestransmitted power at different frequencies; moving across the street oftenrequired purchasing new lights and appliances because that area might becontrolled by another electricity provider. A chaotic tangle of poles andcrisscrossing wires blocked the sky; some of those lines lost their insulation,releasing fiery discharges and even electrocuting several careless childrenplaying under the poles. Some uniformity was needed if electricity was toattract customers and gain market share.Second, some twenty different electrical “systems” operated in the UnitedStates, each with its own limitations. Charles Brush’s high-voltage,direct-current approach could supply power to arc lights for street lighting,but those lamps produced a ghastly white glare and buzzed disagreeably; thatsystem couldn’t run indoor lamps or appliance motors, nor could its power besent any significant distance. Thomas Edison’s low-voltage, direct-currentscheme lit incandescent lamps in densely populated New York neighborhoods, butit only distributed electricity short distances and without enough force topower large machines. George Westinghouse planned for a high-voltage,alternating-current system that could send power over long distances, but nomotors ran on AC. Each approach, in short, was designed to meet a specific need.None of them supplied electricity in substantial amounts for multiple uses.Tesla’s genius was to provide order to the electricity business and to create anefficient motor that allowed alternating current to meet numerous demands. Hisinventions helped bring needed uniformity to an emerging power industry. Whileother engineers tried to devise better commutators, Tesla envisioned a totallynew approach that linked alternating currents that were out of phase with eachother. According to Tesla, this “poly-phase” system overcame the limitations ofhis competitors.With Brown and Peck offering the time and resources to convert his idea for anAC motor into a prototype, Tesla initially tried to modify the Weston dynamo inhis workshop, experimenting with different windings. He eventually focused onsending separate currents to separate coils, and then he ensured those currentswere out of phase with each other, meaning that when one was at itspositive-value peak the other reached its maximum negative value. Not dissimilarto the wobbling ball atop an old ring transformer at Ganz and Company about fiveyears before, Tesla now placed a shoe-polish tin on a pin in the center of hisown innovative ring. The tin began to spin rapidly. Success!It was still a long way from a spinning tin can to a commercial AC motor. Teslaalso understood that a workable motor depended on an entire system, including atransformer that raised the voltage (the electric pressure in a line) and sentpower long distances, and then another transformer that reduced that voltagebefore the current entered a home, allowing the power to illuminate lamps andrun appliance motors.Such transformers also intrigued Westinghouse, who had already proved histechnical genius by developing air brakes for railroad cars. A skilledbusinessman, the Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse foresaw a profit opportunity foralternating-current systems to challenge ­Edison’s dominance in the electricityindustry. Because of DC power’s range restrictions, Edison’s markets werelimited to densely populated areas. However, the Edison system had the advantageof being the entrenched approach and was perceived as being the safest.Westinghouse argued AC systems could profitably serve more cities and towns, ifeffective transformers and motors could be developed. This dispute betweendirect current and alternating current—between Edison and­Westinghouse/Tesla—became known as the “War of the Currents.”The stakes were huge. The victor would reap enormous riches by controlling theinfrastructure and intellectual property of what was to become the nation’slargest industry. Yet the contest promised far more than personal wealth:whoever won would determine the speed and breadth of a new economic and culturalage. Electricity promised to power emerging industries as well as new appliancesthat could keep food fresh and buildings cool. The length of working days wouldno longer be determined by the sun. Elevators and streetcars would raise andexpand the urban landscape. Electric-powered street lamps even promised toreduce violent crime. Achieving those opportunities certainly requiredinventors, but also lawyers, publicists, and investors.While Peck and Brown certainly hoped Tesla’s alternating-current innovationswould win out, they initially pushed for an improved DC device; with theprevalence of DC systems in the United States, that innovation would find aready market. Stubbornly clinging to his AC vision, Tesla orchestrated adramatic demonstration to change their priorities and open up the wallets ofinvestors. He invoked the story of Christopher Columbus challenging his criticsto balance an egg on its end; when Columbus thought outside the box and crackedthe egg’s end slightly, so the tale goes, an impressed Queen Isabella investedin the explorer’s transatlantic project. Similarly, Tesla placed a copper egg ontop of a wooden table, beneath which he had placed a four-coil magnet producingalternating current. When the scientist flipped a switch, the egg began to spin,and as its rotation accelerated, the egg stopped wobbling and stood on its end,revealing both motion and stasis at the same time. The astonished Peck and Brownbecame fervent AC fans.By the fall of 1887, Tesla and his sponsors moved to the next phase—filing apatent on the AC motor in order to protect the invention. Peck turned to ParkerPage of the respected law firm of Duncan, Curtis & Page. The Harvard-educatedPage demonstrated substantial interest in Tesla’s motor: his own father haddabbled with electricity and battery-powered locomotives, and his mother hadsold an induction-coil patent to Western Union. Page and Tesla worked closelytogether for several months, deciding to file one application for an entireelectricity-transmission system rather than a series of patents for differentcomponents. The Patent Office, however, argued that the proposal was toosweeping and demanded separate applications for various apparatuses. In May 1888Tesla was granted seven patents covering his AC motor and other poly-phaseinventions.Despite Page’s expertise and demonstrated success, Tesla could be a testyclient. When the Reichsgericht later rejected two of his patent applications,the inventor complained: “I knew when the German patents were sent off that theomissions [of detailed drawing] were very important ones, but at that time youpaid no attention to my statements.” Tesla criticized: “I want you to understandthat I do not exactly blame you, but you must yourself admit that we have two orthree times had hard luck, if you want me to use this term, which could havebeen avoided by careful attention to all formalities.”29 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-168]This from the visionary who had disliked drafting; obviously, Tesla had grown tounderstand the importance of detailed drawings.Tesla spent the spring and summer of 1888 devising some twenty variations to hispoly-phase motor, some to start up under heavy loads, some to run at variablespeeds, and others to operate at constant speed. (Those AC motor designseventually found their niche powering heavy machinery as well as refrigerators,fans, and other appliances.) Page filed patent applications for each, while Peckand Brown developed a business plan to market the devices. Rather than open andmanage their own manufacturing plant, which the bureaucracy-hating Tesla wouldhave abhorred, the partners decided to sell the poly-phase patents to otherindustrialists. Convincing buyers that Tesla’s patents offered enormous profitpotential meant getting his inventions recognized by the media and scientists.Peck and Brown, in essence, became Tesla’s public relations agents.Unfortunately, the thirty-two-year-old inventor had kept a low profile duringhis four years in New York. He had not joined any of the professionalassociations, such as the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, ElectricalClub of New York, or National Electric Light Association. Peck and Brown feltTesla could use the endorsement of a respected expert, so they turned to WilliamAnthony, who had been a professor of physics at Cornell University. To protectagainst snooping competitors, the inventor and the professor exchanged visits inprivate, and Anthony came away impressed, claiming Tesla’s motors were 50–60percent more efficient than direct-current models. In a letter to a colleague,Anthony stated, “I [have] seen a system of alternating current motors in N.Y.that promised great things.”30 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-169]With the professor’s praise and the patents approved, Peck and Brown arrangedfor the two leading trade journalists—Charles Price of the Electrical Review andThomas Commerford Martin of Electrical World—to visit Tesla’s lab. Price quicklywrote a favorable story and Martin became entranced with the inventor, whom hedescribed as having “eyes that recall all the stories one has read of keennessof vision and phenomenal ability to see through things.” Finding Tesla to be a“congenial companion,” Martin styled their initial conversation as “dealing atfirst with things near at hand and next . . . rises to the greater questions oflife, and duty, and destiny.”31 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-170] With his handsome baldhead and sculpted mustache, Martin proved to be an effectivepromoter—flamboyant, aggressive, well-connected, and well-versed in electricalengineering. Known to his friends as Commerford, he had helped to establish theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers (the forerunner of today’s Instituteof Electrical and Electronics Engineers or IEEE).Tesla and Martin, both born in the same year, complemented each other, with theeditor gaining good copy from the brilliant inventor. The author could begushing and florid, saying “Mr. Tesla has been held a visionary, deceived by theflash of casual shooting stars; but the growing conviction of his professionalbrethren is that because he saw farther he saw first the low lights flickeringon tangible new continents of science.”32 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-171] Tesla, inturn, having admired how Edison attracted a steady stream of newspapermen topublicize his Menlo Park feats, relied on Martin for similar assistance. Thepublicist soon prompted a glowing profile in the New York World, Manhattan’swidest-circulation daily, with a headline reading “OUR FOREMOST ELECTRICIAN” anda subhead of “Greater Even Than Edison.”33 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-172] A few monthslater, the New York Times promoted a multi-columned profile of Tesla with thesubhead: “Advancing with Certainty to Greatest Triumphs.”34[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-173]Still, the reclusive inventor preferred isolation over mingling, and heinitially saw little advantage in giving speeches or writing articles. Martinpersisted, sensing that Tesla represented a new wave within the increasinglyglamorous field of electrical engineering. He wrote: “Tesla stood very muchalone, [as] the majority (of the electricians) were entirely unfamiliar with[the motor’s] value.”35 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-174]When convinced of the need to garner public attention, Tesla began to eat dinnerregularly at Delmonico’s, the posh restaurant where he could be seen by thecity’s wealthy and famous. It was “the one and only time in my life,” he saidlater, when “I tried to roar a little bit like a lion.”36[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-175] On occasion—with assistance from Martin, Peck, andBrown—he organized lavish duck dinners for financiers and reporters, followed bytours and demonstrations at his laboratory, which, according to one participant,became “filled with a terrific lightning display, with the snapping, cracklingsound, displacing the reverberation of heaven’s artillery, and all remarked onthe weird and awing effect of the exhibition.”37 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-176] Locatedin the graceful and triangular brownstone at 2 South William Street in New YorkCity, Delmonico’s grand dining room featured polished silverware, translucentchina, flowing purple curtains, and a bar of rich dark wood. The restaurantintroduced the Delmonico steak and lobster Newburg and reportedly launched bakedAlaska and eggs Benedict. It attracted the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, MarkTwain, “Diamond Jim” Brady and Lillian Russell, J. P. Morgan, Edward VII, andNapoleon III.Martin, Peck, and Brown also put Tesla on the lecture circuit, with thehighest-profile talk being to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers(AIEE) in May 1888. The inventor, feeling overworked and ill, initiallyexpressed reluctance; only after much prodding did he write out his speech—andthen only the night before the talk, in pencil, and hastily.Speaking in his high-pitched voice, the scientist promised to introduce “a novelsystem of electric distribution and transmission of power by means of alternatecurrent . . . which I am confident will at once establish [its] superioradaptability.”38 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-177] He offered a mathematical explanationof electromagnetic forces, as well as a basic description of the poly-phasemotor. He emphasized that the motor was adaptable and synchronous, meaning itcould run at a generator’s speed. Although Tesla had discovered revolutionarynew principles, his diagrams and explanations were clear and lucid, causing someengineers to believe after the lecture that they had known these approaches allalong.Professor Anthony described his positive tests on two of Tesla’s experimentalmotors, and Thomas Commerford Martin boasted about their efficiency. An awkwardsilence came over the room when Elihu Thomson, a distinguished inventor, stoodto describe his own AC motor that relied on a commutator to create a magneticrepulsive force and turn the rotor. Tesla acknowledged Thomson as “beingforemost in his profession,” yet he explained why the best AC motor would notemploy a commutator. Others agreed Thomson had been bested. The event ended withthe AIEE vice president declaring, “I believe that this motor—Mr. Tesla cancorrect me if I am not right—is the first good alternating current motor thathas been put before the public anywhere.”39 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-178]Tesla’s poly-phase motor enjoyed several advantages over Thomson’s concept. Itwas cheaper to build since its insulation and windings were simpler, and it didnot need costly brushes or commutators. It was less expensive to operate sinceit required fewer working parts that could wear out quickly. It also was morerugged and could be designed in various sizes, including ones utilizing highervoltages. The U.S. Patent Office confirmed Tesla’s primacy and rejectedThomson’s patent application, arguing Thomson’s “teaser current” approachactually was based on Tesla’s invention. (No doubt Thomson subsequently devisedimprovements for the induction motor, but the legal rejection failed to stop himfrom claiming to be the real inventor of an AC system. Thomson continued his ACenthusiasm even after his Thomson-Houston Company became part of GeneralElectric in 1892; the following year he helped to build a small hydroelectricfacility in Mill Creek, California, which first demonstrated three-phasetransmission.)With the major engineering journals reprinting Tesla’s lecture, his poly-phasepatent now enjoyed credibility and buzz, allowing Peck and Brown to begin themarketing process. Thomson-Houston had no interest since Elihu Thomson wasworking on his own AC motor and believed Tesla was a young upstart whose ideashad little value. The best prospect was Pittsburgh-based George Westinghouse,who was making a big bet on alternating-current equipment.Worried his own company had not been first to develop AC patents, Westinghousesent a lawyer to Turin, Italy, to secure control of Galileo Ferraris’s inductionmotor, and he purchased rights to the transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard ofFrance and John Dixon Gibbs of England. Intrigued by Tesla’s presentation,Westinghouse also sent his legal counselor, H. R. Gardner, to New York toexamine the inventor’s motors. After a demonstration, Gardner wrote to his boss,“The motors, as far as I can judge from the examination which I was enabled tomake, are a success.” Admitting Tesla’s visions were unique and evenrevolutionary, Gardner added: “Mr. Tesla struck me as being a straight-forward,enthusiastic sort of a party, but his description was not of a nature which Iwas enabled, entirely, to comprehend.” The lawyer admitted he kept the visitshort and tried “to avoid giving the impression that the motor was one whichexcited my curiosity.”40 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-179]Peck played the role of hard-ball negotiator, hinting that a San ­Franciscocapitalist, a Mr. Butterworth, was willing to put up $200,000 plus a generousroyalty of $2.50 for every horsepower sold. Gardner found such terms “monstrous”and he told Peck “there was no possibility of our considering the matterseriously.” Peck shot back “that unless [Westinghouse] can let them know by teno’clock, Friday of this week, whether or not we propose, seriously, looking intothe matter, they will accept Butterworth’s proposition.”41[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-180]Westinghouse remained interested. Eager for confirmation that Tesla’s motorsworked as advertised, he dispatched one of his chief scientists, WilliamStanley, Jr. A “nervous and agile” man of no small talent or arrogance, Stanleyarrived at Tesla’s workshop and declared the “Westinghouse boys” had alreadydeveloped an effective AC motor, to which Tesla calmly asked Stanley if he’dlike to see his latest model, and Stanley was won over. He admitted, “Theirmotor is the best thing of the kind I have seen. I believe it more efficientthan most DC motors. I also believe [the patent] belongs to them.”42[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-181]Westinghouse desperately wanted to avoid the risk of lawsuits: “If the Teslapatents are broad enough to control the alternating motor business, then theWestinghouse Electric Company cannot afford to have others own the patents.”43[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-182] Westinghouse argued the $2.50/horsepower charge “seemsrather high, but if it is the only method of operating a motor by thealternating current, and if it is applicable to streetcar work, we canunquestionably easily get from the users of the apparatus whatever tax is putupon it by the inventors.”44 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-183]In mid-July 1888, Westinghouse signed an agreement to own about twenty ofTesla’s poly-phase patents “for inventions of converters and alternating andcontinuous current electric generators, and kindred apparatus,” in exchange for150 shares of his company’s capital stock (then valued at some $315,000, orabout $7.7 million in today’s dollars) as well as the royalty of $2.50 perhorsepower for each alternating-current motor sold.45 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-184]Westinghouse, moreover, offered Tesla $2,000 per month (almost $600,000 annuallyin today’s dollars) if he moved to Pittsburgh to help his engineers construct anAC system.46 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-185]"},{"pageContent":"4. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch4]A WHIRLING FIELD OF FORCE [06_Contents.xhtml#ch4]PittsburghTesla traveled to western Pennsylvania in late July 1888, hopeful his brilliantwork would be appreciated and that he would finally get paid what he deserved.Yet rather than develop the various components of a complete poly-phase system,he and George Westinghouse had to spend substantial time defending their patentsfrom several litigants. Many inventors argued that they’d crossed the finishline before Tesla. Walter Baily, Charles Bradley, and Marcel Deprez, forinstance, contended their discoveries anticipated his. Charles ProteusSteinmetz, who would become General Electric’s chief scientist, proclaimed hehad created the first “monocyclic” AC system, and Elihu Thomson continued todeclare his supremacy. Contesting these claims proved to be expensive, and thevarious and contradictory assertions confused both the public and the courts.However, in September 1900, after some twelve years of legal wrangling, Teslawon a clear judgment from the U.S. Circuit Court of ­Connecticut, whichglowingly declared: “The search lights shed by defendant’s exhibits upon thehistory of this art only serve to illumine the inventive conception ofTesla. . . . It was he who first showed how to transform the toy of Arago intoan engine of power; the ‘laboratory experiment’ of Baily into a practicallysuccessful motor; the indicator into a driver; he first conceived the idea thatthe very impediments of reversal in direction, the contradictions ofalternations might be transformed into power-producing rotations, a whirlingfield of force.”1 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-186]In response to those suggesting Tesla simply offered minor modifications to theworks of others, Judge Townsend commented on the fundamental nature of Tesla’sinvention: “The apparent simplicity of a new device often leads an inexperiencedperson to think that it would have occurred to anyone familiar with the subject,but the decisive answer is that with dozens and perhaps hundreds of otherslaboring in the same field, it had never occurred to anyone before [Tesla].”2[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-187]Here at last was vindication. While the judge conceded that the field was packedwith inventors, he singled out Tesla as both the pioneer and problem solver whomade alternating current work.Tesla and Westinghouse, despite their different styles, proved to be a bettermatch than Tesla and Edison. Westinghouse complemented Tesla, providing guidanceand support. He also offered balance to the unconventional inventor, keeping himgrounded in the present so he could envision the future.Tesla grew to admire his latest partner, a talented inventor in his own right.He found him to be “always smiling, affable, and polite” and would not utter“one word which would have been objectionable, not a gesture which might haveoffended.” Yet, Tesla observed, Westinghouse displayed “tremendous potentialenergy—even to a superficial observer the latent force was manifest. . . . Nofiercer adversary than Westinghouse could have been found when he was crossed.”3[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-188]Both men invented profusely, with Westinghouse holding some four hundredpatents, most notably for railroad brakes. Previous devices, known by trainmenas the “arm-strong brake,” could barely halt a thirty-mile-per-hour train within1,600 feet. Westinghouse’s initial air brakes cut that distance to five hundredfeet, and his refinements—which garnered 103 patents—reduced the length further,avoiding train collisions and curtailing equipment damage.Westinghouse hoped Tesla’s motor could be integrated into his company’ssingle-phase circuits working on a 133-cycle current, since he and his team hadneither the money nor interest to develop an entirely new system. Although Teslapreferred his own poly-phase ideal, expecting engineers to adjust to hisbeautiful configuration, he obediently tried to alter his poly-phase motors.Unfortunately, the alternatives didn’t work effectively at 133 cycles. Aftermany frustrating failures, Westinghouse engineers backed down and changed theircentral-station frequency to suit Tesla’s design, trying to find one high enoughto keep the lights from flickering but low enough to run the motors efficiently.They settled on 60 cycles and began to manufacture an array of generators andelectric motors for trains, pumps, and appliances. Within a decade, the 60-cyclecurrent of the Westinghouse-Tesla partnership became the United States standardfor power production.For a time, Tesla felt happy and productive in Pittsburgh. Guided by a pragmaticboss yet relatively free to invent, he filed some fifteen patent applications in1889, his most productive patent-generating year. At the age of thirty-three, healso worked with the “Westinghouse boys” to electrify the city’s streetcarsystem and to test different amounts of copper and soft Bessemer steel withinhis designs, eventually doubling the system’s output. The Westinghouse Company,in turn, manufactured almost a thousand Tesla motors that year.images [Images/com.jpg]Westinghouse, like Edison, was a decade older than Tesla. His childhood, likeTesla’s, was spent with an inventive parent. George Jr. learned his skills athis father’s shop in Schenectady, New York. George Westinghouse, Sr., openedthat facility in 1856 to build small steam engines, farm machines, and millworks, and the ingenious mechanic eventually acquired several patents for sewingmachines, threshers, and winnowers.Although usually quiet in public, Westinghouse could be engaging and evencharismatic. A solid barrel-chested man of six feet, with brawny muttonchops andan abundant mustache, his eyes appeared both intense and genial. He often wore aformal dark-vested suit and sported an ever-present umbrella. In sartorialhabits, he and Tesla were well matched. According to a biographer, “With hissoft voice, his kind eyes, and his gentle smile, he could charm a bird out of atree.”4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-189] Tesla described Westinghouse as having “apowerful frame, well proportioned, with every joint in working order, an eye asclear as crystal, a quick and springy step—he presented a rare example of healthand strength.”5 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-190]Westinghouse sketched and dictated constantly. At home, he designed on abilliards table, and his limo and private train car served as roving offices.Each morning Westinghouse delivered reams of sketches and directives to histeams, and he demanded fast action. Throughout the afternoons, he dogged theengineers and workers, listening carefully to their concerns and suggestions andusing the corner of virtually any table to draw alternate approaches. Teslaobserved that the manufacturer loved his work: “Like a lion in a forest, hebreathed deep and with delight the smoky air of his factories.”6[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-191]Westinghouse had become a wealthy and successful inventor before he turned hisattentions toward electricity. That he survived and thrived in the ruthlessworld of railroad conglomerates testifies to his business skills andpersistence. Railroad barons—including ­Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jay Gould, andJames Hill—forced smaller lines into bankruptcy, consolidated nationwidemonopolies, and cold-bloodedly squeezed their suppliers and captive customers.Westinghouse learned of their ruthlessness early when he licensed his firstinvention—a “car replacer” that moved derailed trains back onto the tracks—torailroad companies, which quickly made slight “improvements” to his device andclaimed the resulting patents and profits. When it came to his brakes, however,a wiser Westinghouse refused to sell licenses to the railroads, deciding insteadto manufacture the equipment at his own factories in Pittsburgh.No doubt Westinghouse’s electricity work followed Edison’s. While the Menlo Parkteam opened the Pearl Street Station in 1882, Westinghouse’s first majorlighting projects—the Windsor Hotel in New York and the Monongahela Hotel inPittsburgh—started operations in 1886. Later that year, he installed in Trenton,New Jersey, his first “centralized” power station, composed of six 100-volt DCdynamos, each of which could power three hundred lamps. Yet Westinghouseexpanded rapidly. Within three years, his company had connected enoughgenerators to illuminate more than 350,000 incandescent bulbs.Westinghouse built his electric company largely by acquiring other people’spatents rather than relying on his own discoveries. Willing to try innovativetechnologies, the bold and ambitious businessman purchased well, buying thefloundering United States Electric Light ­Company, which owned the importantlamp patents of Hiram Maxim and William Sawyer. Also demonstrating anentrepreneur’s knowledge of the law, Westinghouse filed suit against the EdisonElectric Light Company for infringing on Sawyer’s patent. Edison, of course,fought back, but he remained stubbornly committed only to his own inventions,while Westinghouse courted new ideas.Tesla was initially content to be in Pittsburgh, yet Westinghouse engineers grewfrustrated with him. Some expressed envy of the generous deal he received for aninvention they thought they had developed. Others simply could not tolerate whatthey considered to be a pompous foreigner.And it wasn’t long before the inventor became bored with practical engineeringand the bureaucracy of running a business. This was a man who had visions ofchanging the world. He loathed the mundane tasks associated with tests andadjustments, and he disdained others second guessing his insights. Heincreasingly felt trapped in the present. In the early summer of 1889, whenWestinghouse engineers used graphite bearings despite Tesla’s insistence thatthey would overheat, Tesla abruptly left Pittsburgh for Paris. There he touredthe new Eiffel Tower, attended the Congrès internationale des électriciens, andheard lectures from some of the world’s leading scientists, including VilhelmBjerknes, a Norwegian physicist who had worked with Heinrich Hertz onelectromagnetic waves.The short French outing offered to Tesla an overview of otheralternating-current experiments that “opened up wonderful possibilities ifproducible in practical ways; there were the currents of many ­hundreds ofthousands of amperes, which appealed to the imagination by their astonishingeffects; and most interesting and inviting of all, there were the powerfulelectrical vibrations with their mysterious actions at a distance.”7[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-192] Largely because he learned European inventors weretackling high voltages, he decided to concentrate on high-frequency phenomenon,sensing that a larger number of cycles per second could make lamps glowbrighter, transmit electricity more efficiently, and send power as well ascommunications wirelessly.George Westinghouse tried to persuade him to return to Pittsburgh, offering aneven more generous salary and a well-equipped laboratory. No doubt Tesla wouldhave become a very rich man if he worked within such a large industrial concern,but he favored freedom. That decision proved to be a turning point for Tesla,particularly in terms of productivity.Tesla, who needed equilibrium between the worlds of idealism and reality andbetween the present and the future, felt in Pittsburgh that his balance hadtilted too much toward “this world.” And when he sensed being limited by themundane status quo, Tesla became unhappy and uncreative.“I was not free at Pittsburgh,” he declared. “I was dependent and could notwork.” Seeking to be unburdened from routine tinkering, he longed for “inventingmethods and devising means for enabling scientific men to push investigationsfar out into these practically unknown regions.”8 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-193] As aresult of leaving, he later claimed, “Ideas and inventions rushed through mybrain like Niagara.”9 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-194]"},{"pageContent":"5. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch5]AS REVOLUTIONARY AS GUNPOWDER WAS TO WARFARE [06_Contents.xhtml#ch5]New York CityWhen Tesla returned to New York City in mid-summer 1889, he asked Peck and Brownto locate a slightly larger laboratory space, and with initial revenue from hispatent sales to Westinghouse he moved into the Astor House, which had been thecity’s first luxury hotel. The scientist, moreover, hired a few specialists tohelp in the lab—including a glassblower, two mechanics, and an arc-lightingexpert—although he relied mostly upon Szigeti, “a man,” wrote Tesla, “who had aconsiderable amount of ingenuity and intelligence. . . . He was not exactly atheoretical man, as myself, but he could understand every idea fully.”1[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-195]Tesla each morning walked the sixteen blocks from his hotel, located on thecorner of Broadway and Vesey Street, to his lab within a five-story factorybuilding on the corner of Grand and Lafayette. Again demonstrating his livingbetween two worlds, Tesla dressed for the opera in his regular frock coat andgloves, but he passed an array of sweatshops filled with seamstresses andwoodworkers. He usually arrived around 10:00 a.m., sharing the streets withdouble-parked horse-drawn wagons and vendors hawking clothing, buttons, andglassware.The inventor spent most of his time at the lab either alone or with one or twoassistants; they often worked through the night so as not to be distracted.Other than periodic trips to Pittsburgh to check on the manufacturing of hismotors, he enjoyed the isolation, motivated by the belief he was on the cuttingedge of a new age of discovery.Tesla initially tried to obtain high frequencies by adapting rotary generatorsto operate at substantial speeds. At about twenty thousand cycles per second,however, those machines began to break down. Since rapid reversals of thecurrent caused damaging heat, Tesla had to strike a balance between speed andtemperature, what he described as “a thoroughly Wagnerian opera” in which hestruggled “to get from the Scylla to the Charybdis.”2 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-196]To deal with the heat, Tesla eventually replaced the melting insulation with anair gap, and he made sure the hot iron core couldn’t move to differentpositions. He then cleverly adjusted an induction coil—which produceshigh-voltage pulses from low-voltage current—in order to obtain resonance, inwhich one portion of the circuit drives another to oscillate with greateramplitude, allowing Tesla to produce a current alternating at thirty thousandtimes per second. Although he referred to this invention as an oscillatingtransformer, calling it “as revolutionary as gunpowder was to warfare,”3[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-197] the device quickly became known as the Tesla coil.That high-frequency device provided for the first time a smooth, continuouselectrical current at thousands of volts and at any specific frequency. Itopened the door to advances in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, X-raygeneration, electrotherapy, atom splitting, and the transmission of electricalenergy without wires. Until the 1920s and the advent of vacuum tube oscillators,that groundbreaking machine also formed the core of radio transmitters forwireless telegraphy.Tesla felt his coil would make electrical lighting more efficient. ­Edison’sincandescent bulb, essentially a burning filament within a vacuum, heated up andresulted in a huge waste of energy that Tesla was determined to avoid. Hedesigned various gas-filled cylinders that shone when energized by his newoscillating transformer, and he devised others with phosphorescent coatings thatglowed when excited by the coil’s thrusts. Tesla was doing the impossible—movingpower across a room with neither wires nor groundings. These wireless lamps,according to one reporter, were “devices of mystic origin.”4[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-198] (The glowing tubes, which Tesla called “flaming swords,”looked like the light-sabers imagined almost a hundred years later by GeorgeLukas in Star Wars.)The inventor initially kept his wireless lighting thoughts and efforts tohimself; one early morning he sent his lab assistants out to get some food andwhen they returned Tesla stood in the middle of the lab holding two glowing longglass tubes that were not connected by a wire to his high-frequency coil. “Iwaved them in circles round and round my head,” the enthusiastic Teslaexplained, as he would in later demonstrations at Columbia College. “My men wereactually scared, so new and wonderful was the spectacle. . . . They thought Iwas some kind of a magician or hypnotizer.”5 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-199]Tesla appreciated the popular lure of such new wonders. He enjoyed the wayspectators viewed his glowing tubes “with amazement almost impossible todescribe,” yet he worried that fickle crowds “soon become indifferent to them.The wonders of yesterday become today’s common occurrences.” Commenting on otherbarriers to innovation, he complained that people, particularly investors,resisted radical ideas, even ideas that improved the status quo. He alsogrumbled that entrenched interests opposed change, saying, “Perhaps the greatestimpediment (to invention) is encountered in the prejudicial opinions created inthe minds of experts by organized opposition.”6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-200]Despite such obstacles, Tesla developed more than fifty versions of his coil,some with windings that were cylindrical, conical, or flat, and some insulatedby oil or air. He also devised spark gap transmitters (that generatedelectromagnetic waves), oil-insulated transformers (that raised or loweredvoltages), and condensers (now known as capacitors, which store electricitytemporarily). His goal was simplicity, “doing away with all packings, valves andlubrication” and producing an “absolutely steady and uniform” current.7[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-201] By the start of the twentieth century, the Tesla coilwas a standard part of virtually every college science laboratory in the UnitedStates and Europe. (Almost thirty years later, scientists at the CarnegieInstitution of Washington used a 5-million-volt Tesla coil in their pioneeringattempt to smash the atom.)The experiments with Tesla’s coil were not without their dangers. One evening,the inventor, even after taking his normal precautions, claimed to have been“almost killed today” after receiving a 3.5-million-volt shock from one of hismachines. “The spark jumped three feet through the air,” Tesla revealed, “andstruck me here on the right shoulder. I tell you it made me feel dizzy. If myassistant had not turned off the current instantly it might have been the end ofme. As it was, I have to show for it a queer mark on my right breast where thecurrent struck in and a burned heel in one of my socks where it left my body.”8[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-202]The combination of Tesla’s AC motor and high-frequency coil catapulted him intothe front ranks of inventors, placing him on a par in public popularity andamong his scientific colleagues with Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. Hewas thirty-three years old and full of ideas and promise.Three unrelated events, however, tempered Tesla’s progress and outlook. Thefirst involved money, particularly the royalty provided by George Westinghouse.Tesla’s inventions had helped Westinghouse expand rapidly—from $800,000 in salesin 1887 to $4.7 million in 1890. To build factories and hire engineers, thePittsburgh businessman had borrowed heavily, and when the national economytumbled in November 1890, Westinghouse’s bankers called in their loans, and hewas forced to turn to Wall Street investors who demanded a financialreorganization that would rein in the firm’s spending.J. P. Morgan and other rich financiers, in fact, sought to starve Westinghouseout. In that era of robber barons and giant monopolies, they thought they coulddo to power generation what they had done to steel, oil, and sugar production.They essentially wanted Westinghouse to sell his company at a cheap price andallow them to create a conglomerate that would control the emerging electricityindustry.Westinghouse balked but had few options. His best hope was to ask Tesla torenegotiate their contract for a $2.50-per-horsepower royalty for each motorsold, so he approached the inventor directly and declared, “Your decisiondetermines the fate of the Westinghouse Company.” According to Tesla’s firstbiographer, who tended to glorify and dramatize the scientist’s actions andwords, Tesla responded, “If I give up the contract, you will save your companyand retain control? You will proceed with your plans to give my poly-phasesystem to the world?”Although the episode is not mentioned in Westinghouse’s official biography, thebusinessman supposedly replied, “I believe your poly-phase system is thegreatest discovery in the field of electricity. . . . It was my efforts to makeit available to the world that brought on the present difficulty. But I intendto continue, no matter what happens, with my original plans to put the countryon an alternating-current basis.”“Mr. Westinghouse,” Tesla responded theatrically, “you have been my friend; youbelieved in me when others had no faith; you were brave enough to goahead . . . when others lacked courage; you supported me when even your ownengineers lacked vision to see the big things ahead that you and Isaw. . . . You will save your company so that you can develop my inventions.Here is your contract and here is my contract—I will tear both of them topieces, and you will no longer have any troubles from my royalties. Is thatsufficient?”9 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-203]It’s hard to imagine how anyone would walk away from that much money. No doubtthe inventor was a poor bargainer and businessman; in this instance, he actuallyhad the negotiating advantage since he held the underlying patents and a signedcontract. Tesla also was a romantic, believing he needed to sacrifice in orderfor the world to enjoy his inventions; yet despite such selfless claims heclearly enjoyed the fancy meals and lodgings money could provide. No doubt hetruly respected Westinghouse, was grateful for the businessman’s early support,and believed he was “the only man on the globe who could take my alternatingcurrent system under the circumstances then existing and win the battle againstprejudice and money power.”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-204] Tesla, moreover, remainedextremely confident in his own ability to invent greater devices. Still, thedecision to tear up the Westinghouse contract changed Tesla’s life in ways hecouldn’t have imagined, forcing him to face financial challenges for the rest ofhis life.The contract termination helped Westinghouse attract new financing and maintainlimited control of his company. Yet the loss of royalties meant Tesla sacrificedsubstantial sums—probably hundreds of millions in today’s dollars—that mighthave allowed him to finance better laboratories and expensive experiments.Tesla, however, maintained his personal admiration of Westinghouse, and the twowould work together to power the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and totap Niagara Falls’ hydroelectric potential.Given that Tesla’s invention hugely benefitted the Westinghouse Electric &Manufacturing Company and that the chairman greatly admired the inventor, whydidn’t George Westinghouse reward Tesla when the company became prosperous? Theanswer seems to be that Wall Street bankers and investors, who increasinglycontrolled Westinghouse’s finances, paid only for understandings bound bylegality rather than loyalty.The second event that inhibited Tesla was the unexpected death of Charles Peck,a key supporter, promoter, and advisor. The lawyer became sick, moved toAsheville, North Carolina, and died there in the summer of 1890. As evidenced byhis successful promotion of Tesla’s AC-motor patent and his subsequentnegotiations with Westinghouse, Peck had provided the business acumen andreality check the idealistic inventor so desperately needed.And the third event that affected Tesla was deeply personal. Tesla had fewequals; however, Anthony Szigeti had been his “best friend” and confidante fornearly a decade. Szigeti was with Tesla in a Budapest park when he outlined hisalternating-current motor in the sand with a stick. The two of them worked sideby side in various laboratories and often shared long walks and lengthy dinners.Their relationship had become more than one of employer to employee. Theinventor referred to Szigeti as “the only one who had supported me during myfirst attempts and whom I loved dearly because of his virtues and respect.”11[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-205] In early 1890, Szigeti decided to independently develophis own inventions, particularly an innovative compass for ships. When the twofriends next met, after five months of separation, Tesla, who felt abandoned,scoffed at Szigeti’s efforts, saying the compass already had been developed bySir William Thomson (later to be known as Lord Kelvin), which prompted the proudSzigeti to leave for good, initially to South America. In late 1890, AnthonySzigeti died without warning. Tesla’s only initial reaction to what must havebeen a severe blow was in a note to his family: “I am completely alienated andsometimes it is difficult.”12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-206] Yet twenty years later,Tesla expressed intense pain associated with the loss: “I would have muchdesired to see him, because I would have wanted him.”13 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-207](Some biographers have pointed to such comments and claimed Tesla washomosexual. No doubt he enjoyed close relations with a few men throughout thislife, yet there’s no definite evidence to prove or disprove the assertion. Infact, Tesla’s germophobic refusal to touch others makes it hard to believe heenjoyed romance with either men or women.)Tesla buried his frustrations and anguish in work. In addition to increasing thefrequencies from his oscillating transformer, he developed a spherical carbonbutton that glowed when placed at the end of a wire connected to one terminal ofhis coil. Compared to Edison’s incandescent bulb, this button lamp providedtwenty times as much light for the same amount of current consumed. It featuredrefractory material within a closed and airless globe being bombarded bymolecules activated by his rapidly alternating current. As Tesla put it, themolecules struck the “carbon button” many times a second “and at enormousspeeds, and in this way, with trillions of invisible hammers, pound it until itgets incandescent.”14 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-208] This high-intensity button lamp—adirected ray, what Tesla described as a “pencil thin” line of light, that provedto be the precursor to a laser beam—also could “vaporize” matter and melt evenzirconia and diamonds, the hardest known substances. In what he called “astriking experiment,” Tesla zapped tinfoil, causing it to “not only melt, but itwould be evaporated and the whole process took place in so small an interval oftime that it was like a cannon shot.”15 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-209] The inventorpredicted his button lamp could heat and mold hard metals and thereby wouldrevolutionize the field of metallurgy.images [Images/com.jpg]Tesla increasingly got dragged into the “War of the Currents,” the high-stakesbattle between the advocates of direct and alternating current. In the late1880s, the outcome was not clear. Edison and his financial backers, includingthe powerful J. P. Morgan, held the advantage, certainly the most projects andthe most funding. Tesla and George Westinghouse had what they thought was a morepowerful and efficient system. Both electrical approaches, however, competedagainst natural gas companies that were not willing to cede their dominance overthe markets for lighting and heating. The stakes, and the potential profits,were substantial.Westinghouse had initially taken the high road in this “war” by inviting Edisonin 1888 to tour his facilities in Pittsburgh, writing him a personal note: “Ibelieve there has been a systematic attempt on the part of some people to do agreat deal of mischief and create as great a difference as possible between theEdison Company and The Westinghouse Electric Co. when there ought to be anentirely different condition of affairs.”16 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-210] Edisonrebuffed Westinghouse’s offer, claiming “my laboratory work consumes the wholeof my time.”17 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-211] And he doubled down on the distinctionbetween AC and DC, saying “direct current was like a river flowing peacefully tosea, while alternating current was like a torrent rushing violently over aprecipice.”18 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-212]Edison launched a public relations campaign in fall 1890 against alternatingcurrent, including an eighty-four-page diatribe that assailed Westinghouse andpleaded incongruously with “all electricians who believe in the future ofelectricity . . . to unite in a war of extermination against cheapness inapplied electricity, whenever they see that it involves inefficiency anddanger.”19 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-213] Westinghouse shot back with his own brochurechallenging Edison’s own safety record: “Of the 125 central stations of theleading direct current company [Edison’s] there were numerous cases of fire, inthree of which cases the central station itself was entirely destroyed.”20[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-214]The war then turned gruesome. Edison dispatched an associate—Harold Brown, whoEdison claimed was not an official employee but who had access to the Menlo Parklaboratory and regularly shared conspiratorial letters with the famousinventor—to orchestrate a public display in which he placed electric wires onthe head of a sixty-seven-pound dog described as vicious. Direct current, evenat varying voltages, did little to the black retriever, but high-voltagealternating current killed it immediately. According to one journalist, “Many ofthe spectators left the room unable to endure the revolting exhibition.”21[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-215] Not stopping with a single dog, Brown conducted the same“experiment” on fifty different creatures, including cats, calves, and a horse,in order to demonstrate AC was the perfect medium for electrocution.Thomas Edison actually suggested to the New York legislature that electrocutionby alternating current offered a more humane method of capital punishment thanhanging. The quickest and most painless death, he wrote, “can be accomplished bythe use of electricity, and the most suitable apparatus for the purpose is thatclass of dynamo-electric machine which employs intermittent currents. The mosteffective of those are known as ‘alternating machines’ manufactured principallyin this country by Geo. Westinghouse.” Edison went so far as to recommend thatthe new capital-punishment procedure be named “Westinghoused,” and he publishedpromotional brochures warning homeowners: “Don’t let your house getWestinghoused.”22 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-216]Edison himself outlined specific electrocution procedures, proposing “to manaclethe wrists with chain connections, place . . . the culprit’s head in a jar ofwater diluted with caustic potash and connect therein . . . to a thousand voltsof alternating current.”23 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-217] His lobbyists convinced NewYork State to power these electric chairs at the Auburn and Sing Sing StatePrisons with secondhand Westinghouse generators (Westinghouse refused to sellany). The first human electrocution took place on August 6, 1890, of WilliamKemmler, a thirty-year-old ­alcoholic who had murdered his common-law wife witha hatchet, smashing her skull twenty-six times. Although guilty of a heinouscrime, ­Kemmler suffered a death that was described as “an awful spectacle, farworse than hanging,” with witnesses saying the criminal’s spinal cord explodedinto flames as the current ran through his body for seventeen seconds.Furthermore, “to the horror of all present, the [prisoner’s] chest began toheave, foam issued from the mouth, and the man gave every evidence ofreviving.”24 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-218] A second jolt finally caused Kemmler to gorigid, but his clothes and skin caught fire and the New York Times reported,“The stench was unbearable.”25 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-219]The execution turned public opinion against Brown and Edison. One disgustedeyewitness declared, “I would rather see ten hangings than one such execution asthis.” Other newspapers likened the work to barbarians and torturers within “thedarkest chambers of the Inquisition of the 16th Century.”26[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-220] Edison embarrassed himself further by suggesting thatfuture electrocutions avoid placing the shock on the criminal’s head, since hairwas nonconductive; instead, he argued, “The better way is to place the hands ina jar of water . . . and to let the current be turned on there.”27[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-221]Tesla entered the debate by writing about his inventions. In the February 1891issue of Electrical Engineer, he described how alternating current could sendpower safely over long distances. Edison responded bitterly, and the twoinventors sparred in a series of trade-journal letters throughout the winter andspring. Raising the stakes, the scientist decided to lecture to the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers, this time on May 20, 1891, at ColumbiaCollege in New York City.As mentioned at the beginning of this book, Tesla, with a thick Eastern Europeanaccent but impeccable English grammar, started this lecture and show byexpressing wonder at the forces of nature: “What is electricity,” he askedprovocatively, “and is there such a thing as electricity?” He suggested the lawsof electricity change when power moves from direct to alternating currents.“When the currents are rapidly varying in strength,” he observed, “quitedifferent phenomena, often unexpected, present themselves, and quite differentlaws hold good.” He discussed electromagnetic waves, electrostatic thrusts, andthe muscle of high-frequency AC. One reporter described the scientist’s insightsas “epoch making.”28 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-222]Yet Tesla’s demonstrations were what captivated the crowd of experimenters,reporters, and financiers. For a man claiming to be shy, he became a mastershowman. As he increased the current’s frequency, he illuminated lamps andgas-filled tubes without wires, heat, or flames whenever he passed them betweenthe electrostatic field created by charged zinc plates on either side of thestage. Debunking ­Edison’s claims about AC’s dangers, the “magician” also sentthousands of volts of alternating current through his body, which caused hiscoat to radiate a soft blue and his fingers to release tiny sparkles, yet theinventor remained very much alive.The glowing tubes were a crowd favorite, with one reporter writing “theyappeared like a luminous sword in the hand of an archangel representingjustice.”29 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-223] The inventor’s ideal, in fact, was to createa powerful, rapidly alternating electrostatic field that would allow “anilluminating device” to be lighted anywhere in a room “without beingelectrically connected to anything.” Yet the dreamer admitted: “How far thisprinciple is capable of practical application, the future will tell.”30[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-224]These wireless transmissions inspired Tesla, who described them as “the firstevidence that I was conveying energy to a distance, and it was a tremendous spurto my imagination.”31 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-225] He had separated the energizedplates for the Columbia College lecture by fifteen feet but believed wirelesselectromagnetic charges could travel much farther.Tesla concluded his two-hour lecture with another tribute to electricity’swonder. “The field is wide and completely unexplored,” he said, “and at everystep a new truth is gleaned, a novel fact observed.” The concept of “availingourselves of [nature’s] energy more directly” gave him hope “humanity willadvance with great strides.” Ever the optimist, he concluded, “The merecontemplation of these magnificent possibilities expands our minds, strengthensour hopes, and fills our hearts with supreme delight.”32 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-226]Numerous other showmen were demonstrating scientific ­wonders and attractingenthusiastic crowds during this period. Con men abounded, such as Walter Honenauclaiming to obtain free energy from a “hydro-atomizer,” Gaston Bulmar sellingspecial pills that supposedly turned water into gasoline, and Victor “the Count”Lustig introducing a machine that purportedly converted white paper into crisptwenty-dollar bills. Perhaps the most noteworthy snake-oil salesman was JohnErnst Worrell Keely, a former “circus slight-of-hand performer” who claimed tohave developed a perpetual motion motor. With his scientific soundingexplanations—such as “the reflex action of gravity” or “depolar ethericwaves”—Keely obtained regular coverage from the New York dailies and aninvestment from none other than John Jacob Astor. Even luminaries like ThomasEdison advanced dubious but popular assertions, such as his professed ability tophotograph thoughts.No doubt Tesla, too, made outlandish claims, such as his prognostication that hewould communicate with other planets. Yet even though most of his visions wererealized, Tesla was forced to compete with bogus inventors for the public’sattention and the investment community’s resources.Still, Tesla’s reputation continued to grow and reports of his successes madeheadlines in both the United States and Europe, where he became something of ahero to his family and to Serbs in general. A brother-in-law wrote, “We thinkabout you even in [our] dreams.”33 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-227] Tesla began sendingmoney to his mother and sisters, although his letters back home were addressedto their husbands and he noted, “Somehow it is hard to correspond with theladies.”34 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-228] His sisters begged regularly for somecorrespondence, complaining “We all feel badly that you did not write,”35[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-229] or “a simple word from you with your handwriting wouldstop a million tears and strengthen me for future struggles.”36[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-230] One sibling even pleaded, “We do not have anyone exceptyou.”37 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-231]Tesla also received a string of requests for money or investments from uncles,nephews, cousins, and even great nephews—several of whom he did not know. Onecousin, who introduced herself as the youngest daughter of his Aunt Smiljana,begged: “We are now in the greatest need and by the end of the year [our bills]must be paid.”38 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-232] ­Others sought jobs in Tesla’slaboratory for themselves or relatives.Tesla’s family kept up with European newspaper accounts of his accomplishments,and they responded with commendations as well as concerns about the overworkedinventor who, sister Marica said, maintained a “frail body construction.”39[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-233] Tesla periodically would provide his own updates as wellas boasts: “It is difficult to give you an idea how I am respected here in thescientific community.”40 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-234]Although busy with his research and presentations, Tesla completed hiscitizenship requirements in late July 1891. He expressed great happiness inbeing an American, saying his official papers, which he kept in a safethroughout his life, were more important than any of his “diplomas, degrees,gold medals, and other distinctions [that] are packed away in old trunks.”41[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-235] When asked a few years later if he were a good American,he declared, “I was a good American before I ever saw this country . . . Whatopportunities this country offers a man! Its people are a thousand years aheadof the people of any other nation of the world.”42 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-236]Tesla, however, never abandoned his pride in being born and raised a Serb. Hismost valued title, “Grand Officer of the Order of St. Sava,” was bestowed inBelgrade, the Serbian capital, by King ­Alexander I ­Obrenovic. Remembering hisancestors’ struggles against the “unspeakable Turk,” he reflected on how Serbsdeveloped notable qualities of bravery and sagacity while maintaining a sense ofpatriotism and independence. “If [my] hopes [of bringing some of my ideas to thebenefit of all humanity] become one day a reality,” he said, “my greatest joywould spring from the fact that this work would be the work of a Serb.”43[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-237]"},{"pageContent":"6. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch6]ORDER OF THE FLAMING SWORD [06_Contents.xhtml#ch6]EuropeAs Tesla’s fame grew, so did the number of his legitimate competitors. Hispresentations and articles certainly spurred others to play off his ideas, yetnumerous inventors were independently pursuing their own approaches to apractical motor and power distribution. British journals continued to creditGalileo Ferraris with developing the first rotating-field motor. F. A.Haselwander, a German engineer, claimed to have invented the initial poly-phasemachine. Oskar von Miller, another German scientist, insisted that he offeredthe first demonstration of long-distance electricity transmission.Tesla in 1892, at the age of thirty-six, decided to travel to Europe to defendhis own patent claims, as well as to market his inventions to manufacturers inBritain and on the continent. Unlike his first trip across the Atlantic eightyears earlier, Tesla returned in a first-class cabin and with far more than fourcents in his pockets, thanks to the continued, although diminished, paymentsfrom Westinghouse. Building on the success of his Columbia College lecture, hesecured speaking invitations in both London and Paris.On the back end of his trip, he planned to visit his mother in ­Gospic. They hadnot been together for almost a decade, although they maintained fairly regularcorrespondence. He continued to refer to her as his inventing inspiration, andhe professed “a consuming desire to see her again.”1 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-238]The Atlantic Ocean crossing gave Tesla a chance to reflect on his achievementsand motivations. His New York City demonstration and the introduction of asuccessful motor had propelled him to become the toast of the town, yet he feltisolated after the deaths of his best friend and his valued business advisor.What would inspire him going forward? Although he enjoyed expensive dinners atDelmonico’s, his tearing up of the Westinghouse royalty contract demonstratedthat money was not his prime motivation. No doubt he worked hard to establishand maintain his image as a great inventor, yet he possessed a certain modesty.What Tesla recognized on the ship’s deck was that his real love was inventing,to pursue the uncertain but glorious process of trying to realize his visions.The inventor was invited to address the Institution of Electrical Engineers atthe Royal Institution in London on February 3, 1892. Some eight hundred peoplein evening dress filled the institution’s amphitheater. The audience includedthe leaders of England’s scientific community, and Tesla began by praising oneof their own, Sir William Crookes, the renowned chemist who had conducted earlyexperiments with radiation. Tesla revealed that his reading of a “fascinatinglittle book” by Crookes many years before had prompted his interest inelectricity.Tesla spoke humbly at first. “The results which I have the honor to presentbefore such a gathering I cannot call my own. There are among you not a few whocan lay better claim than myself to any feature of merit which this work cancontain.” One reporter who agreed wrote: “Seldom has there been such a gatheringof all the foremost electrical authorities of the day, on the tiptoe ofexpectation.”2 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-239]As in previous lectures, the scientist admitted astonishment at nature’s power.With enthusiasm and delight, he asked, “Can there be a more interesting studythan that of alternating current?” Electricity, he declared, “takes the manydifferent forms of heat, light, mechanical energy, and . . . even chemicalaffinity. . . . All of these observations fascinate us.”3[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-240] He claimed his goal was “to transform, to transmit, anddirect energy at will.” For the passionate Tesla, “the mass of iron and wires[associated with electricity generation and distribution] behaved asthough . . . endowed with life.”4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-241]Despite such awe, Tesla admitted the basics of electricity generation weresurprisingly ordinary: “We wind a simple ring or iron with coils; we establishthe connections to the generator, and with wonder and delight we note theeffects of strange forces which we bring into play, which allow us to transform,to transmit, and direct energy at will.” He argued, however, that his newfoundability to alternate the current to very high frequencies produced astonishingresults, which were just beginning to be revealed and appreciated.5[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-242]Tesla treated the two-hour lecture as a seminar for other inventors, providingadvice to aid their experiments. Based on his own trials, for instance, hesuggested researchers coat the bases of their lamps with aluminum “on account ofits many remarkable properties.” He also offered them motivation. “Each day wego to our work,” he said, “in the hope that someone, no matter who, may find asolution [to] one of the pending problems—and each succeeding day we return toour task with renewed ardor.”6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-243] Countering his previousclaims that he designed machines only in his head, Tesla admitted testing anarray of materials for the wire to his carbon button: “I have tried at firstsilk and cotton covered wires with oil immersions, but I have been gradually ledto use gutta-percha covered wires, which proved most satisfactory.”7[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-244]The showman began the evening’s entertainment portion, as he had at ColumbiaCollege, by walking around the stage between two electrified zinc sheets andholding a long glass tube that glowed “with a brilliant lambent flame from endto end.” Standing on an insulated platform, he directed electrical “streams uponsmall surfaces” and produced “magnificent colors of phosphorescent light” simplyby picking up tubes. Tesla, according to a reporter, “recalled to everyone theidea of the magician’s enchanted wand.”8 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-245]The inventor kept offering “wonder after wonder.” Six-inch sparks leapt betweentwo balls, foot-long wires glowed blue, and bulbs radiated within theelectrostatic field. He showed how his motor could run on a single wire, a novelfeat in itself, but he brashly suggested wires may not be needed at all sincepower could be drawn from the earth or atmosphere. He honored Lord Kelvin, therenowned physicist who was still living but not among the onlookers. Teslaspelled out his common name, William Thomson, in light, written with illuminatedglass tubing. The crowd applauded with each demonstration, and an ­Englishcommentator noted: “The interest of the audience deepened into enthusiasm.”9[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-246]For the lecture’s conclusion, reported Electrical Review, “Mr. Teslatantalizingly informed his listeners that he had shown them but one-third ofwhat he was prepared to do, and the whole audience . . . remained in theirseats, unwilling to disperse, insisting upon more.”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-247]His goal, he claimed, had been to “point out phenomena or features of novelty”in order to “advance ideas which I am hopeful will serve as starting points ofnew departures.”11 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-248] During the question-and-answerperiod, someone asked if the scientist felt pain as electricity flashed throughhim, and Tesla responded, “A spark, of course, passes through my hands, and maypuncture the skin, and sometimes I receive an occasional burn, but that is all;and even this can be avoided if I hold a conductor of suitable size in my handand then take hold of the current.”12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-249]Lord Rayleigh, who had isolated argon and would in 1904 receive the Nobel Prizefor physics, closed out the event by commending the inventor for having “thegenius of the discoverer.”13 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-250] Rayleigh’s memorable praisemotivated Tesla, who recalled, “[Rayleigh] said that I possessed a particulargift of discovery and that I should concentrate upon one big idea.”14[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-251] Although he still had to win the “War of the Currents,”Tesla pledged to focus on the wireless transmission of messages and power, theideal that would obsess him for the rest of his life.Most attendees, according to Electrical Engineer, were “spellbound” by Tesla’s“easy confidence and the most modest manner possible displaying his experiments,and suggesting, one after another, outlooks for the practical application of hisresearches.”15 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-252] That magazine ran a glowing profile anddeclared Tesla’s research on electrical motors and coils preceded Ferraris andHaselwander.16 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-253] A separate trade journal credited Teslawith giving many of those attending “for the first time apparently limitlesspossibilities in the applications and control of electricity.”17[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-254] Yet at least one participant wondered if thepresentation was more showmanship than science; The Electrician’s editorcomplained that Tesla “did not write and read a paper, nor did he give alecture, and he was so occupied in waving long glowing electrodeless tubes inthe air, and lighting up of ordinary incandescent lamps by a current takenthrough his body, that he had no time to explore ‘how it was done.’ Nor, Ithink, could he.”18 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-255]After Tesla’s Royal Institution debut, British notables lined up to meet the newsensation. Imagine the thrill for a young immigrant, whose own father neveracknowledged his talents or accomplishments, to suddenly be venerated by thescience nobility. Still, Tesla did his best to avoid shaking hands with orgetting too close to his admirers.Ambrose Fleming, inventor of the vacuum tube, invited Tesla to visit hislaboratory at University College and declared that “no one can doubt yourqualifications as a magician of the first order.” The English aristocrat went sofar as to dub the American inventor a charter member of his newly created “Orderof the Flaming Sword.”19 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-256]James Dewar, the Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution,begged Tesla to give a second lecture, and he proved to be very persuasive.According to Tesla, the Scotsman “pushed me into a chair and poured out half aglass of a wonderful brown fluid which sparkled in all sorts of iridescentcolors and tasted like nectar. ‘Now,’ said he, ‘you are sitting in Faraday’schair and you are enjoying whiskey he used to drink.’ ”20[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-257] The honor of being treated like Michael Faraday, thebrilliant scientist who in the 1830s discovered electromagnetism, overwhelmedthe thirty-six-year-old Tesla, who agreed to another two-hour talk anddemonstration.A few days later, a weary Tesla traveled to Paris to deliver a third lecture,this time before the Société française de physique and the Sociétéinternationale des électriciens. The City of Light had become even moreilluminated in the three years since he had attended the electrical congress,and Tesla himself had become something of a luminary. While he must have beenexhausted, he nonetheless won over the crowd with his showmanship, revolutionaryinsights, and wild predictions. One attending electrician noted, “The youngscientist is . . . almost as a prophet. He introduces so much warmth andsincerity into his explanations and experiments that faith wins us, and despiteourselves, we believe that we are witnesses of the dawn of a nearby revolutionin the present processes of illumination.”21 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-258]Reporters also commented on the scientist’s mesmerizing qualities. “Tesla’sbright eyes glowed as he spoke of his work,” wrote one journalist. “Leaningforward, peering almost each moment into the eyes of his [audience] to make surethat his meaning has been understood, he proved a talker from whose train ofreasoning there was no escape while a man was under his influence.”22[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-259] According to Electrical Review, “No man in our age hasachieved such a universal scientific reputation in a single stride as thisgifted young electrical engineer.”23 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-260]Still, Tesla attracted critics. William Stanley, the American physicist whoworked for George Westinghouse, argued that he was the true inventor of analternating-current system, and Thomas Edison continued to assert the advantagesof direct current. A few simply doubted Tesla’s claims, with one magazineproclaiming, “It is questionable whether the Tesla motor can ever be asuccess.”24 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-261]A persistent Tesla capitalized on his newfound fame to promote his foreignpatents to a variety of French manufacturers. This unceasing outreach hadalready begun to deplete the scientist when he received a telegram from hisUncle Petar that his mother was seriously ill. “[I] was just coming to from oneof my peculiar sleeping spells, which had been caused by prolonged exertion ofthe brain,” Tesla remembered, in a fashion similar to the prophetic anddisturbing visions he encountered in his youth. “Imagine the pain and distress Ifelt when it flashed upon my mind that a dispatch was handed to me at that verymoment bearing the sad news that my mother was dying.”25 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-262]Nikola rushed to Gospic, where his three sisters embraced him. He walked quicklyfrom the train station through town, which had changed little except for theaddition of electric street lamps. When he reached his mother’s side, shewhispered, “You’ve arrived, Nidzo, my pride.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-263] Teslacried at the sight of his beloved inspiration, now ashen and frail. The two hadnot spoken in about ten years, yet they said little. The son simply maintained aclose watch that day and evening by Djuka’s bed and witnessed her “agony.”Since Tesla was “completely exhausted by pain and long vigilance,”27[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-264] a family member eventually relieved him from the vigiland another took him to an apartment two blocks away in order to sleepuninterrupted. In the midst of his slumber, in what he later described as asupernatural experience, Tesla “saw a cloud carrying angelic figures ofmarvelous beauty, one of whom gazed upon me lovingly and gradually assumed thefeatures of my mother. The vision slowly floated across the room and vanished,and I was awakened by an indescribably sweet song of many voices. In thatinstant a certainty, which no words can express, came upon me that my mother hadjust died. And it was true.”28 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-265]Djuka was sixty years old when she passed away at three o’clock in the morningof April 4, 1892. Because she descended from three generations of religiousleaders, six Serbian Orthodox priests officiated at her funeral, and she wasburied next to her husband. Their white obelisk headstones are in the Jasikovaccemetery in Divoselo.Devastated, Tesla remained in Gospic for another six weeks. “I don’t have totell you that I am very sad and holding myself in restraint,” he wrote to arelative. “I was afraid of this event a while ago, but the blow was heavy.”29[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-266] Even thirty years later, Tesla declared, “The mother’sloss grips one’s head more powerfully than any other sad experience in life.”30[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-267]Tesla’s dream of his mother dying haunted him. While visions fed his inventing,for some reason he needed to explain away this “strange manifestation.” In fact,he never clarified the line between images that prompted his creativity andapparitions that he considered weird and demanded clarification. Numerouscontemporary and respected researchers would have accepted a paranormalexplanation for the dream about Djuka’s death.31 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-268] SirWilliam Crookes, known for his systematic research on cathode rays, alsoexperimented with mental telepathy, human levitation, and photographs fromséances, and he helped found the Society of Psychical Research with LordRayleigh, Oliver Lodge, and other notables. Even Thomas Edison studied telepathyand developed a “telephone” to help spiritualists communicate with the deceased.Tesla, however, sought a more rational account, and he eventually recalledhaving seen a year or so before a painting, an allegory of one of the seasons,that included a group of angels “which seemed to actually float in the air.” Healso remembered hearing a choir perform an early Mass for Easter morning. Thoseimages and sounds, he concluded, matched his dream, “with the exception of mymother’s likeness.” And he declared with relief, “Thus everything was explainedsatisfactorily, and in conformity with scientific facts.”32[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-269]Several years later, Tesla experienced a similar intuition regarding one of hissisters. From New York, he sent home a telegram, “I had a vision that Angelinawas arising and disappearing. I sensed all is not well.” In fact, she wasfatally ill, and a return telegram soon confirmed her death. This time when thescientist tried to explain his precognition, he decided that he simply was asensitive receiver capable of registering cosmic disturbances that conveyedimportant news. On a separate occasion, Tesla gave a dinner party for severalclose friends, but as they were about to depart for a late train toPhiladelphia, he had a premonition that “ill adventure would befall them.” Tesladelayed them, caused them to miss their connection, only to learn the followingday that the train experienced a terrible accident that killed many passengers.Tesla offered no scientific explanation for that forewarning.In Tesla’s life, the line between supernatural and inspirational was thin. Whileroaming in the mountains after his mother’s death, he saw an approaching stormand scrambled for shelter. From his perch, he witnessed a sudden lightning flashfollowed a few moments later by a deluge. “This observation,” he said, “set methinking.” If the lightning and storm were closely related, maybe lightningacted “much like that of a sensitive trigger.” That observation led to thisinsight: “If we could produce electric effects of the required quality, thiswhole planet and the conditions of existence on it could be transformed. If itwere in our power to upset it when and wherever desired, this mightylife-sustaining stream could be at will controlled.” And from that insight hecommitted to developing an even more powerful transformer to provide “electricforces of the order of those in nature.” With that “sensitive trigger”resonating upon the earth’s inherent energy flows, Tesla predicted he couldtransmit electricity and messages through the planet without wires.33[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-270]"},{"pageContent":"7. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch7]DIVINE ORGAN OF SIGHT [06_Contents.xhtml#ch7]ChicagoTesla keenly felt the loss of his mother—his inspiration and key supporter. Yetalongside the personal hardship, he made professional headway on his Europeantrip. Flush with funds from having sold licenses to British and Frenchmanufacturers, he returned to the United States in late August 1892 and switchedhis residence to the posh, eleven-story Gerlach Hotel on 27th Street, betweenSixth Avenue and Broadway. Built in the Queen Anne style with bowed bays alongthe sides and red brick walls trimmed with stone, the Gerlach was “an elegantstructure . . . [that] offers all that is possible for luxuriousness infurnishings and delight in cuisine.”1 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-271] Tesla’s dwellingwas referred to as a French flat to distinguish it from most New York“apartments” of the period that were squalid and crowded tenements. (Theresidential building, now with a few retail shops on the ground floor, has beenrenamed the Radio Wave Building and features a plaque commemorating NikolaTesla, who placed a receiver on the hotel’s roof in order to capture some of thefirst radio transmissions from his downtown workshop.)After arising at 6:30 a.m., having gotten three hours of sleep, Tesla enjoyed alight breakfast, performed a few gymnastic exercises, and began his dailythirty-block walk from his fancy hotel to his new and larger laboratory space onthe fourth floor of an uninviting huge ­yellowish brick building2[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-272] just south of Washington Square and in the heart ofGreenwich Village that was teeming with cheap restaurants, wine shops, andweather-beaten tenements.Tesla counted his steps, making sure they were divisible by three. The journeyinitially took him by the new Madison Square Garden, a massive indoor arenarecently designed by famed architect ­Stanford White and topped by a gilt-copperstatue of Diana sculpted by ­Augustus Saint-Gaudens. (White would become one ofTesla’s close friends, Saint-Gaudens would meet the inventor at dinner parties,and the statue would be moved to the World’s Columbian Exposition in ­Chicago,where Tesla would later organize a grand demonstration of hisalternating-current system.) Tesla strode past Madison Square Park, a lovelysix-acre public space, and then south on Fifth Avenue until the city reverted toa village. The upper sections of Fifth Avenue were lined by elegant gas lampsand spotted with fancy carriages. As Tesla moved south, horse-drawn carts movedan array of goods from markets to shops, and the street became more crowded andlouder with hawkers advancing their wares. Each new block featured stallspromoting different products, including emporiums of buttons and freshly blownglass. As Tesla wove his way through the crowds, the streets became lined withold brick residences of the pre–Civil War period. That journey marked another ofTesla’s alternating worlds, having his bed on elegant 27th Street and his headin the village among peddlers.Most of Tesla’s hours were spent in his shirtsleeves or dark frock coat, workingdiligently with his staff and on his instruments. He only used his small office,furnished with a rolltop desk and a rug, on the rare occasion when guests wantedto talk privately. According to a visiting reporter, that office, reflectingTesla’s personal orderliness, “was immaculate, not a speck of dust is to beseen; no papers litter the desk, everything just so.”3 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-273]Tesla joined the AC versus DC battle in 1891 with his presentation at New York’sColumbia College. Now he devoted himself to winning the “War of the Currents” bypowering the World’s Columbian Exposition scheduled for Chicago in 1893. He andhis partner, George Westinghouse, were determined to demonstrate theeffectiveness of alternating current at the international fair. Tesla wouldagain be facing Thomas Edison, who touted direct current (DC) for maintaining aconstant low voltage all the way from the power generator to the ultimatecustomer. Focused on safety (and his own profits), Edison argued his DC-basedsystem produced power not strong enough to cause dangerous electric shocks.“We’re set up for direct current in America,” he declared. “People like it, andit’s all I’ll ever fool with. . . . Spare me that nonsense. [Alternating currentis] dangerous.”4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-274] Direct current’s shortcoming, as notedpreviously, was that it lacked the force for long-distance transmission.The different approaches demonstrated different views about electricity’sfuture. Although he launched the Pearl Street Station that transmitted power tonearby offices, Edison tended to think electricity would remain a luxury itemenjoyed by those, such as J. P. Morgan, who could afford smaller generators intheir homes. Tesla’s vision was more democratic, with centralized power plantssending electricity throughout communities. For many years, Edison seemed to bewinning, since Pearl Street remained the only central station in 1883 andisolated plants had increased to 334.Several leading scientists—including Lord Kelvin, Werner von ­Siemans, and ElihuThomson—initially feared high-voltage power lines could electrocute innocentbystanders, yet it was Edison who led the charge. Unwilling to considertechnologies he did not develop, he had become, according to a biographer, “thestubborn, reactionary old man of the electrical industry.”5[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-275] Edison certainly had a clear financial motivation tochallenge Tesla’s disruptive notion that electricity did not need to flow onlyin one direction. The Wizard and his allies had sunk millions of dollars into adirect-current system that included generators, wires, and motors. That systemwas, as the novelist Starling Lawrence put it, “a kind of theology written insteel and copper, and all dedicated to a single false assumption.” Edison, hecontinued, “was shackled to his own success [and] could not jump, or chose notto.”6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-276]Out of the limelight, Tesla sought to prove the commercial effectiveness of hisAC motor and transmission system. L. L. Nunn, manager of the Gold King Mine,needed cheap power for his facility in the rugged San Juan Mountains aboveTelluride, Colorado. He was running out of nearby wood and coal was notavailable. He approached the Westinghouse Company in 1891 about transmittingelectricity three miles over rough mountain terrain from a generator near alarge waterfall. Tesla was called upon to install an AC generator in the valley,string $700 worth of copper wire up the steep hills, and place a transformer atthe mine that stepped down the current to run a hundred-horsepower Tesla motorthat would power the mine’s operations. Much to the delight of the Westinghouseengineers, the system withstood the mountain’s frequent storms and high winds,providing reliable power. Electrical Engineer declared the Tesla motor a successand that “work in this field is fast passing from experimental investigationinto practical electrical engineering.”7 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-277]William Stanley, Westinghouse’s chief scientist, had tested similar transformersin Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in 1886. In his small lab, he placed atwenty-five-horsepower steam engine, an alternator, and a transformer thatstepped up the voltage from five hundred to three thousand. He then nailed twoNo. 6 wires along the elm trees bordering the town’s sidewalks. In the cellarsof six buildings, he placed other transformers that stepped the voltage backdown to a pressure that would power lamps. Although the wealthy town alreadyfeatured a small Edison direct-current power system, Stanley demonstrated areliable and effective transformer for alternating current. (In 1890, Stanleyformed the Stanley Electric Manufacturing Company, in which General Electric in1903 purchased a controlling interest, and he would thereafter assert that Teslahad stolen his AC ideas from himself and Galileo Ferraris.)Edison, as noted earlier, tried for years to discredit AC as dangerous,escalating from pamphlets to gruesome electrocutions. Tesla responded by againtaking the stage with more shows highlighting the wonders of alternatingcurrent. In the battle to obtain the World’s Columbian Exposition contract,which promised to settle the “War of the Currents,” Tesla gave thought-provokinglectures and demonstrations at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia inFebruary 1893 and then in St. Louis in March, but he did not limit himself tothe glories of transmitting alternating current long distances. His mind wasalready racing to the next challenge.In Pennsylvania, he suggested, for the first time publicly, that electricitycould be transmitted wirelessly. “It is practicable,” he said, “to disturb bymeans of powerful machines [such as the Tesla coil] the electrostatic conditionsof the earth and thus transmit intelligible signals and perhaps power.” Teslaappreciated that this theory would puzzle the assembled scientists and admittedlater that “only a small part of what I had intended to say [about wirelesstransmissions] was embodied” in the speech. Yet it was this “little salvage fromthe wreck,” especially his principle of utilizing resonance to obtain maximumsensitivity and selective reception, that later would allow him to claim thetitle “Father of the Wireless.”8 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-278] In fact, these shortreferences to wireless, only a tiny portion of the hundred-page lecture, becamea key point in later legal battles over who invented the radio.In St. Louis, the scientist packed the Grand Music Entertainment Hall, whichseated four thousand but attracted a few thousand more willing to stand,creating a room “crowded to suffocation.”9 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-279] Tesla hadbecome a celebrity, and a bulletin summarizing his life sold more than fourthousand copies on the streets of St. Louis. Eager attendees, however, admittedthe lecture got off to a slow start, with Tesla rambling for almost twentyminutes about the “divine organ of sight.” According to the scientist, “Of theparts which constitute the material or tangible of our being, of all its organsand senses, the eye is the most wonderful.” He continued: “The eye is the meansthrough which the human race has acquired the entire knowledge it possess, thatit controls all our motions, more still, all our actions.”10[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-280]Tesla only slowly drew a connection between the eye and light, and thenproclaimed: “The phenomena of light and heat . . . may be called electricphenomena,” which he described as “the mother science of all and its study hasbecome all important.” Foreseeing the future accurately, he predicted: “Powertransmission, which at present is merely a stimulus to enterprise, will somedaybe a dire necessity.”11 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-281]Audience members became mesmerized by his words as well as his appearance. Hisjet-black hair covered a rather large head with a high broad forehead. Onereporter suggested his wedge-shaped face featured a chin as pointed as an icepick and a mouth that was too small. Several people noted his big hands andparticularly large thumbs; indeed, another journalist suggested these outsizedappendages were “a good sign [since] the thumb is the intellectual part of thehand.”12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-282]The experimenter finally began to entertain the gathering when he brought ametallic ball to within eight or ten inches of his coil’s free terminal,provoking “a torrent of furious sparks.” When he moved his free hand close tothe coil’s other terminal, the air became “more violently agitated and you seestreams of light now break forth from my fingertips and from the whole hand.”13[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-283] As Tesla increased the frequency, the streamers turnedfrom a purplish hue to bright white, and the pungent whiff of chlorine bleachpermeated the large auditorium as electric streamers disturbed the air andcreated ozone. Violet glowworms danced across the walls and ceiling, producing athick and wavy cobweb of light. To counter Edison’s claims about the dangers ofalternating current, Tesla offered himself as the subject of the experiment andhe assured the nervous crowd “the streamers offer no particular inconvenience,except that in the ends of the finger tips a burning sensation is felt.”14[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-284]As he had done in New York, London, and Paris, Tesla also waved differentlyshaped tubes that in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field provided“wonderfully beautiful effects . . . the light of the whirled tube being made tolook like the white spokes of a wheel of glowing moonbeams.” To the delight ofthe audience members, who shouted “Bravo” at his performance, Tesla held agas-filled bulb in one hand and touched his other to the oscillatingtransformer. When the lamp glowed brightly, he recalled, “there was a stampedein the two upper galleries and they all rushed out. They thought it was somepart of the devil’s work, and ran out. That was the way my experiments werereceived.”15 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-285]Tesla admitted his glowing tubes and spark-tinged fingertips offered noimmediate practical application, yet practicality was not the point. While somedisplays featured “only a few play things” that were of little value to thegreat world of science, he was introducing his audience to the future. He waschallenging, almost taunting, them to follow his mind.What was noteworthy in Tesla’s St. Louis lecture was his willingness to expandon his dreams for wireless transmissions. Suggesting this ideal “constantlyfills my thoughts,” he predicted “the transmission of intelligible signals orperhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires.” Engaging theaudience in his future plans, the inventor said he was working to “know what the[electrical] capacity of the earth is and what charge does it contain ifelectrified.”16 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-286]Several hundred fans swarmed the dramatic inventor in the Exhibition Theater’slobby, trying to shake his hand. The germophobic Tesla turned pale and tried tomove through the crowd quickly. He “had expected a little gathering of expertelectricians,” reported one newspaper. “Though he went through the ordealbravely, no power on earth would induce him to try anything like it again.”17[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-287]While Edison’s grotesque theatrics might have been more sensational, Tesla’sentertaining lectures were more persuasive. Tesla both debunked Edison’s claimsand demonstrated the widespread benefits available from long-distancealternating current. As a result, Westinghouse began to win the commercialcontest, selling AC systems in 1893 that powered twelve times more lights thanEdison. Even Edison’s own Detroit Edison station manager successfully advanced aresolution at the 1889 meeting of the Edison Illuminating Company to have theparent firm provide “a flexible method of enlarging the territory which can beprofitably covered from their stations for domestic lighting by higher pressuresand consequently less outlay of copper.”18 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-288]Meanwhile, robber barons were wrestling to control the nation’s electricalpower. Henry Villard, Edison’s largest backer (and the man who drove the goldenspike that linked the nation’s rail lines), had been working secretly with J. P.Morgan to consolidate the electrical equipment manufacturers. The two of themfirst approached George ­Westinghouse, who expressed initial interest in mergingwith the ­Edison General Electric Company, but Thomas Edison would have none ofit. “Westinghouse,” he said, “has gone crazy over sudden accession of wealth orsomething unknown to me and is flying a kite that will land him in the mudsooner or later.”19 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-289] After Edison won a court judgmentfor his invention of the incandescent lightbulb (reversing a previous decision),the equally competitive Westinghouse soured on a deal, prompting Villard toreach out to Tesla directly. While Tesla thought a merger would further advancehis AC system, he couldn’t convince Westinghouse, who owned many of his patents.“I have approached Mr. Westinghouse in a number of ways and endeavored to get toan understanding,” Tesla wrote to Villard, “[but] the results have not been verypromising . . . Realizing this, and also considering carefully the chances andprobabilities of success, I have concluded that I cannot associate myself withthe undertaking you contemplate.”20 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-290]Villard turned his merger-making attentions to Charles Coffin, a former shoemanufacturer who had bought the patent rights of Elihu Thomson and EdwinHouston, who had been high school classmates, and became chief executive officerof the Thomson-Houston Company. By offering easy credit and by accepting thesecurities of local companies generating and delivering electricity, thebrilliant and fast-talking Coffin had expanded Thomson-Houston’s business andincreased its value beyond that of Edison General Electric. A merger of thosetwo firms made both financial and technological sense, in part because thecompanies possessed complementary patent holdings. Edison General Electricdominated urban DC stations, DC power transmission, and street railways;Thomson-Houston’s strength lay in arc lighting and alternating currents. Namingthe merged company, however, sparked the most controversy. Thomson and Edisonvehemently opposed each other’s name in the title. The only solution was tosimply call the new firm “General Electric.” Although Edison, then forty-fiveyears old, maintained a position on the board, he was stunned and hurt by thechange.At this stage, the “War of the Currents” seemed to have Tesla winning the publicrelations struggle but General Electric (GE), now without Edison, assemblingsome serious money. The deciding battle would be waged in Chicago at the WorldColumbian Exposition of 1893. The international world’s fair—marking the 400thanniversary of Columbus landing in the Americas (admittedly one year late inorder to accommodate a presidential election)—ultimately attracted twenty-sevenmillion visitors (half Americans, half foreigners). Even in the midst of aneconomic recession, American boosters wanted to celebrate and highlight theircountry’s engineering superiority with a massive display of electricity’swonders.More than seven thousand workers spent more than a year converting a bleakswampy bog seven miles south of the city on Lake Michigan into an opulentfairground. The landscape artist Frederick Law Olmsted arranged a Venetian-stylesystem of canals and lagoons surrounding massive exhibition halls and ornatepalaces designed by architect Daniel Burnham. The classical Beaux Artsstructures suggested a model metropolis, even though Burnham was designingskyscrapers in Chicago and other cities that dramatically altered the urbanskyline. Common roof pediment lines and creamy marble integrated this surrealWhite City, which became the electricians’ greatest canvas for their modernwonders.The new General Electric Company misjudged the proud Chicago organizers whowanted to showcase their raw and vibrant metropolis and did not trust theeastern elite. Sensitive to being confused for rubes, they balked at thesky-high rates initially demanded by the ­“electrical trust.” Although the faircommittee had been paying only $11 per lamp to light the construction site fornight work, General Electric bid $38.50 per lamp for six thousand lights toilluminate the completed fairgrounds. Chicago organizers worked out a short-termand cheaper deal with several smaller firms, prompting the local papers toherald: ­“Electric Light Combine Humbled” and “Cannot Rob the Fair.”Seeing an opportunity, Westinghouse took a high-profile gamble and bid just halfof General Electric’s final quote of $1.7 million to supply and operate thefair’s lamps and motors. “There is not much money in the work at the figures Ihave made,” he admitted, “but the advertisement will be a valuable one and Iwant it.”21 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-291] Although Westinghouse won the criticalcontract, he immediately faced legal and technical challenges. ­General Electricthreatened patent-infringement lawsuits if Westinghouse used, or developedsomething close to, the Edison incandescent lightbulb, which featured a carbonfilament within an all-glass globe from which air was evacuated. Successfullitigation, boasted a hard-charging GE executive, would place Westinghouse“entirely in our power. He will not be able to make his own lamps, and he canonly buy them from us.”22 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-292]Rather than rely on his own lawyers, Westinghouse turned to Tesla and thecompany’s engineers to develop a unique two-piece lamp, in which a rubber“stopper” could be removed in order to replace burned-out filaments. Otherinventors had tried the approach and failed, largely because the design couldn’tseem to hold a vacuum, without which the filament would be exposed to air andburn out quickly. Tesla and the Westinghouse team tested scores of combinations,but even the strongest filament within the most reliable “stopper” bulb expiredrelatively quickly. To maintain a hundred thousand lighted bulbs, therefore,Westinghouse arranged for trains each evening during the fair to transportdamaged lights from Chicago to his Pittsburgh factories and others to return inthe morning with repaired replacements. The result, despite the effort andexpense, transformed the World Columbian Exposition into a glowing wonderland.Lamps were not Westinghouse’s only challenge. What Chicago required was on ascale far grander than anyone had attempted. The Westinghouse-Tesla teamupgraded motors and transformers, and they enlarged a dozen generators. WhatWestinghouse and Tesla assembled became the world’s largest AC system, poweringthe greatest concentration of artificial light, yet, amazingly enough, theirthousand-square-foot switchboard required only one engineer to operate the fortycircuits that delivered electricity throughout the park.The effect staggered wide-eyed visitors as well as skeptical engineers. WhenPresident Grover Cleveland pushed an ivory-and-gold button on May 1, 1893, theseven-hundred-acre fairground burst into light, elaborate fountains shot water ahundred feet into the air, accompanied by cannon fire, and a choir and orchestraperformed Handel’s “Hallelujah Chorus.” A shroud fell from Daniel ChesterFrench’s giant Statue of the Republic. Children’s writer L. Frank Baum claimedthe Chicago marvel inspired his Emerald City and the Wizard of Oz. Many visitorswept tears of joy.The fair, in fact, marked a turning point for the country. At the same timeBuffalo Bill’s Wild West shows were drawing sell-out crowds, Frederick JacksonTurner, a thirty-two-year-old University of Wisconsin history professor, waslecturing to his American Historical Association colleagues that the frontierhad closed. Mass marketing, moreover, was opening opportunities for nationalbrand products, including Cream of Wheat cereal, Aunt Jemima pancake mix,Cracker Jacks, and Juicy Fruit gum. Also previewed at the fair were the zipperand yellow pencils.The World Columbian Exposition and Tesla’s efforts need to be put in somehistorical context. In addition to displaying the new abundance of mass-producedproducts, what Louis Mumford would later refer to as “the goods life,”23[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-293] the Chicago fair highlighted a golden age of invention.Electricity, telephones, motion pictures, elevators, automobiles, typewriters(and the list goes on) altered the landscape and daily life, as well as conveyeda sense of progress and possibilities. Historian Thomas Schlereth referred tothis period in the late nineteenth century as the “age of modernization” thatincluded “industrial production, a commercial agriculture, technologicalinnovation, the accumulation of capital, an urban consciousness, bureaucraticorganization, occupational specialization, and widespread education.”24[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-294] Progress, of course, was not linear. Economicdepressions—including the Panic of 1893 in which railroad firms collapsed andhundreds of banks failed—slowed its development, but fair attendees felt theworld and their lives were changing.Each evening as twilight loomed within the White City a fabulous spectacleevolved. The gold-domed Administration Building was the first to glow, provokingsighs from the appreciative crowd. Then the columns surrounding the Great Basinburst forth from the growing shadows as thousands of Westinghouse “stopper”lamps illuminated the cornices, pediments, and statues. The crowd clappedwildly. New bulbs then set the palaces alight, offering radiant images of aglorified age. Arc lights illuminated the walkways, bright bulbs shimmeredacross the dark waters of the 1,500-foot Great Basin, ghostly gondolas suddenlyappeared from their docks, and two massive fountains shot into the airtwenty-two thousand gallons of water a minute. As if in a finale, which could beseen eighty-five miles away in Milwaukee, four massive searchlights raked thenight sky, switching from dazzling white to light blue, to green, and then toblood red.The fair’s electrical system powered two hundred fifty thousand lamps, scores ofcascades, hundreds of exhibits, the Intramural Elevated Railway, the launchesthat plied the lagoons, the Sliding Railway on the thousand-foot pier(essentially an early escalator), and the great Ferris wheel (rising 262 feet,with the capacity of carrying more than two thousand people, while chargingfifty cents for two revolutions). The exposition, in fact, generated andconsumed three times more power each day than did the entire city of Chicago,and it was declared “a magnificent triumph of the age of electricity.”25[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-295] Just three years before, the Paris Exposition’selectrical display had helped earn Paris the nickname City of Light. Incomparison, Chicago’s Columbian Exposition featured ten times the lamps andhorsepower of the French fair.The Electricity Pavilion itself covered the equivalent of more than two footballfields and was as wide as another. The second floor featured electrical devicesfor curing ailments and promoting personal hygiene, including electricalhairbrushes, charged belts to spur sexual activity, and body invigorators. Amodel home suggested the domestic future belonged to electric stoves,dishwashers, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, as well as electric doorbellsand fire alarms.The building’s main floor displayed the inventions of major companies andinventors, several of whom gave lectures and demonstrations. Elihu Thomson, forinstance, presented his own high-frequency coil that sent sparks five feet intothe air. Thomas Edison debuted his phonograph (or talking machine) andkinetescope (or moving picture projector); ironically, one of the only Edisonincandescent bulbs in the entire fairground was an eight-foot-tall, half-tonmodel at General Electric’s display. The Allegemeine Elektrizitats Gesellschaft(AEG) Company from Germany displayed the alternating-current equipment used inthe “epoch-making” 108-mile Lauffen-to-Frankfurt transmission. Yet leaving nodoubt about what company won the fair’s electrical contract and which inventorcontrolled the relevant patents, the center aisle of Electricity Hall featured amonument standing forty-five feet tall and spelling out in big bold letters:“Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. Tesla Polyphase System.”Introduced for his formal lecture on a sultry Friday night by white-hairedElisha Gray, a telephone pioneer, this “Wizard of Physics” appeared to be “atall, gaunt young man” dressed dapperly in a “neat four-button cutaway suit ofbrownish gray.” A few attendees noticed that his shoes featured thick soles ofinsulating cork. Tesla smiled but “modestly kept his eyes on the floor.” Onejournalist said “his cheeks were hollow, his black eyes sunken . . . butsparking with animation.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-296] Another, however, describedhis appearance as “somewhat like a resurrected cadaver.”27[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-297]More than a thousand engineers “crowded about the doors and clamored foradmittance,” most of them hoping to witness high-voltage AC electricity passthrough the inventor’s body. According to a newspaper reporter, “Mr. Tesla hasbeen seen receiving through his hands currents . . . [that vibrated] a milliontimes per second, and manifesting themselves in dazzling streams oflight. . . . After such a striking test, which, by the way, no one has displayeda hurried inclination to repeat, Mr. Tesla’s body and clothing have continuedfor some time to emit fine glimmers or halos of splintered light. In fact, anactual flame is produced by the agitation of electrostatically chargedmolecules, and the curious spectacle can be seen of puissant, white, etherealflames that do not consume anything, bursting from the ends of an induction coilas though it were the bush on holy ground.”28 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-298]Tesla’s machines offered dazzling flashes that, according to one writer,produced “the effect of a modified lightning discharge . . . accompanied by asimilar deafening noise.”29 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-299] Across a long table in hisown display room the inventor assembled an assortment of coils and motors,providing what another journalist described as “a fair idea of the gradualevolution of the fundamental idea of the rotating magnetic field.”30[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-300] Two distinguished professors, when asked by a reporterabout the various equipment, “gazed in wonder and confessed they could notguess” the purpose of what they referred to as “Tesla’s animals.” Phosphorescenttubes and lamps glowed in a darkened alcove. Twisted tubing, the prototype ofneon display lighting, radiated “Welcome, Electricians,” while other cursivelights honored great scientists such as Faraday and Franklin, as well as Tesla’sfavorite Serbian poet, Zmaj Jovan. To demonstrate how poly-phase currents createrotating fields, Tesla set ostrich-sized copper eggs twirling rapidly atop avelvet-covered table, under which hummed a four-coil magnet. Electric clocksdisplayed perfect synchronization.31 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-301]Tesla, thus, effectively challenged Edison’s claims of AC’s dangers,demonstrating that high-voltage currents, when frequencies also were high, couldbe completely harmless. According to one report from the event, “Professor Tesla[sent] a current of 100,000 volts through his own body without injury to life,an experiment which seems all the more wonderful when we recall the fact thatthe currents made use of for executing murderers at Sing Sing, NY, have neverexceeded 2,000 volts.”32 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-302]More importantly, both tourists and scientists came away from the fair convincedthe future of energy belonged to electricity and its future belonged toalternating current. They had glimpsed the outlines of a radiant electricalworld that would alter how they spent their evenings, how they commuted to work,how machines would take over the arduous tasks long performed by animals andbackbreaking human labor. One hundred twenty-five years later, today we realizethe Chicago World’s Fair illuminated our modern era.Tesla and Westinghouse had won the “War of the Currents”! After the World’sColumbian Exposition, some 80 percent of electrical devices ordered in theUnited States utilized Tesla’s designs.images [Images/com.jpg]With this success behind them, Westinghouse and Tesla turned to the enormoushydroelectric opportunities at Niagara Falls, where thundering green torrentsfell violently down a 160-foot cliff and made rainbows dance and the earthtremble. Engineers had long assumed the only options to move such power werepulleys, hydraulics, or waterwheels that provided limited service to buildingslocated no more than several hundred feet from the Niagara River’s rapids. Totransmit larger amounts of power beyond the small community of Niagara,hopefully to the industrial facilities twenty-two miles away in Buffalo, somescientists suggested sending pressurized water through pipes, while othersproposed using compressed air.The World’s Columbian Exposition expanded those options by demonstrating analternating-current system to be both possible and preferable. Still,Westinghouse and Tesla faced seventeen rival firms that submitted bids to tapthe torrent. The aggressive competition even prompted charges of industrialespionage. When Westinghouse suspected that General Electric engineers hadstolen his blueprints, he obtained a court order directing the local sheriff toenter GE’s Lynn plant. Lo and behold, the sheriff found the missing documents intheir possession. GE officials claimed they were just making sure Westinghousedid not pirate their own patented lightbulbs, and a jury split six to six on averdict. Ever the gentleman, Tesla described the spying controversy as “atrifle, to be sure, not worthy of any consideration.”33 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-303]Deciding among the various bids was Edward Dean Adams, a respected engineer andinvestment banker with close ties to J. P. ­Morgan and an indirect lineage totwo U.S. presidents. A slight man with a large handlebar mustache, Adams in 1890assembled 103 financiers, considered “one of the most powerful combinations ofNew York capitalists . . . ever . . . formed,”34 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-304] tocreate the Cataract Construction Company, which then launched the InternationalNiagara Commission to obtain expert engineering advice on harnessing theenormous hydroelectric potential from Niagara Falls.Westinghouse initially ignored Adams’s pleas for a bid, growling: “These peopleare trying to secure $100,000 worth of information by offering prizes, thelargest of which is $3,000. When they are ready to do business, we will showthem how to do it.”35 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-305] Westinghouse also was buying timefor his Pittsburgh-based engineers to devise a more ­efficient way to wind theAC motor’s rotor as well as to design an effective converter that enhanced thelong-distance transmission of power—refinements that would allow Westinghouse tomake full use of Tesla’s poly-phase system. This delay conveniently allowedAdams to witness AC’s benefits and safety in Chicago, and he increasingly turnedfor advice to Tesla, who encouraged the engineer to embrace alternating-currenttechnologies that would electrify and bring economic development to a wider areaof New York State. Tesla baldly declared, “It would be entirely impossible forany system to compete (with my) ideally simple one.”36 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-306]Adams kept posing both legal and engineering questions. When asked if aThomson-Houston patent superseded his, Tesla protested it had “absolutelynothing to do with my discovery of the rotating magnetic field and the radicallynovel features of my system of transmission of power disclosed in my foundationpatents of 1888. All the elements shown in the Thomson patent were well knownand had been used long before.”37 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-307] When asked aboutsupport for a direct-current ­system from the distinguished Sir William Thomson,whom Queen Victoria had recently elevated to become Lord Kelvin (and was notrelated to Elihu Thomson), a horrified Tesla declared “how disadvantageous, ifnot fatal, to your enterprise such a plan would be, but I do not think itpossible that your engineers could consider seriously such a proposition of thiskind.”38 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-308]Adams eventually agreed that rather than have the rushing waters simply turn aseries of small waterwheels, two massive Niagara electrical generators shouldsupply more power than all the central plants then operating in the UnitedStates. It was not an easy decision; as he noted, it was based on “faith andhope that electrical engineers could produce apparatus much larger in size thanever had been built and that new types which were then hardly beyond the stageof experiment would prove successful.”39 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-309] Adamsspecifically sought bids to divert the river’s turbulent waters into threeeight-foot-wide penstocks or pipes and then spin the wheels of gigantictwenty-nine-ton turbines, the world’s biggest. Those turbines, in turn, wouldwhirl attached steel shafts that would rotate the two electrical generators upon the project’s main floor, which was referred to as “the cathedral of power.”Westinghouse won the key contract in October 1893 with a bold plan to utilizeTesla-designed equipment to capture the power of a diverted Niagara River.General Electric, in large part because of J. P. Morgan’s clout, was not leftempty-handed, receiving smaller awards to construct the transformers and thetransmission line to Buffalo.To close out the “War of the Currents,” Westinghouse threw the switch onNovember 16, 1896, sending the power of Niagara Falls to run Buffalo’sstreetcars and illuminate its street lamps. Within weeks, the Tesla-Westinghousesystem was electrifying factories and high-temperature electric furnaces thatenabled the commercial production of lightweight aluminum and hard carborundum.(About a decade later, Scientific American ranked these electric furnaces as theera’s greatest invention, noting they allowed the creation of “many absolutelyor commercially new products.”)40 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-310]The availability of abundant electricity put the Buffalo/Niagara region on themap, attracting the world’s largest concentration of electrochemicalfirms—producing “acetylene, alkalis, sodium, bleaches, caustic soda, [and]chlorine.”41 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-311] Within a few years, ten generators atNiagara Falls were transmitting alternating current some four hundred miles toNew York City, where it powered new subways and lit Broadway, which became knownas the Great White Way.Although the Niagara Falls project was not the world’s first demonstration oflong-distance electricity transmission, it was certainly the most dramatic. Backin 1879, Charles Brush designed water-driven dynamos that sent power severalmiles to high-altitude gold mines in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where arclights enabled miners to work through the night and double their productivity.In 1889, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti transmitted what was then a remarkableeleven thousand volts over seven miles. Two years later, British engineer C. E.L. Brown of the Oerlikon Company and Russian engineer Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolskyfrom the AEG Company powered a small hundred-horsepower motor at the 1891International Electrotechnical Exhibition in Frankfurt with electricitygenerated by a waterfall at a cement factory on the Neckar River in Lauffen 108miles away. (Brown subsequently acknowledged that they succeeded only by usingTesla’s patents.)42 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-312]These early efforts were limited in scope, yet harnessing the power of NiagaraFalls demanded a complex feat on a grander scale. According to Westinghouse,“The conditions of the problems presented, especially as regards the amount ofpower to be dealt with, have been so far beyond all precedent that it has beennecessary to devise a considerable amount of new apparatus. . . . Nearly everydevice used differs from what has hitherto been our standard practice.”43[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-313]The New York Times referred to the project as “the unrivaled engineering triumphof the nineteenth century,” and the paper declared, “To Tesla belongs theundisputed honor of being the man whose work made this Niagara projectpossible.” The newspaper’s four-column spread, complete with a large portrait ofthe inventor, further commented: “Perhaps the most romantic part of the story ofthis great enterprise would be the history of the career of the man above allmen who made it possible, . . . a man of humble birth, who has risen almostbefore he reached the fullness of manhood to a place in the first rank of theworld’s great scientists and discoverers—Nikola Tesla.”44[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-314]The Westinghouse-Tesla poly-phase system at Niagara Falls marked the dynamicshift from a mechanical era to the age of electricity. Tesla was just forty-oneyears old when he achieved this lifelong goal, not even halfway through his longlife. When prominent businessmen gathered at Buffalo’s Ellicott Club tocelebrate the Niagara project’s inauguration, Tesla’s introduction prompted “amonstrous ovation.” According to newspaper accounts, “The guests sprang to theirfeet and wildly waved napkins and cheered for the famous scientist. It was threeor four minutes before quiet prevailed.”45 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-315]The acclaimed inventor, who had dreamed as a boy in Lika of tapping the power ofNiagara Falls, oddly chose to talk about his sense of inferiority. “Even now asI speak,” he claimed, “I shall experience certain well known sensations ofabandonment, chill and silence. I can see already your disappointed countenancesand can read in them the painful regret of the mistake of your choice.” InJanuary 1897, on the night of his great triumph, when he was celebrated forcreating history-changing technologies, Tesla’s introduction suggested anunderlying sense of self-doubt. “These remarks, gentlemen, are not made with theselfish desire of winning your kindness and indulgence of my shortcomings,” hecontinued, “but with the honest intention of offering you an apology for yourdisappointment.”46 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-316]Here in Buffalo we see Tesla again between two worlds. He’s at the top of hisgame, being applauded for a remarkable and practical electrical achievement. Yetin his head, where he’s moved on and is struggling to envision the wirelesstransmission of power, he’s uncertain and feeling inadequate. That conflictbetween pragmatism and visions will play out regularly as the inventor turned torobots, radio, and the wonders of high-frequency oscillations.The rambling speech at the Ellicott Club also provided insights into Tesla’swork ethic . . . and his disdain for the lazy. While declaring the capture ofNiagara’s power would “offer a guaranty for safe and comfortable existence toall,” he suggested the benefit should not be available to “the greatestcriminals of all—the voluntarily idle.” Toward the end of his address, hedescribed how invention was “the result of long-continued thought and work.”With a flourish, he professed: “With ideas it is like with dizzy heights youclimb: At first they cause you discomfort and you are anxious to get down,distrustful of your own powers; but soon the remoteness of the turmoil of lifeand the inspiring influence of the altitude calm your blood; your step gets firmand sure and you begin to look—for dizzier heights.”47 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-317]Tesla paid lengthy tribute to the engineer as an artist, as well as to theNiagara project’s noble purpose. “It was a happy day for the mass of humanity,”he said, “when the artist felt the desire of becoming a physician, anelectrician, an engineer, or mechanician.” This dual approach to electricalscience, he argued, “has disclosed to us the more intimate relation existingbetween widely different forces and phenomena and has thus led us to a morecomplete comprehension of Nature and its many manifestations to our senses.”Attendees had gathered to celebrate the commercial capture of Niagara’s power,to revel in the project’s profit potential; yet Tesla considered harnessingNiagara a moral advancement that “signifies the subjugation of natural forces tothe service of man, the discontinuance of barbarous methods, the relieving ofmillions from want and suffering.”48 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-318]The inventor, finally, used the occasion to predict more and greaterinnovations. One of his fondest dreams, for which he claimed “fresh hope,” was“the transmission of power from station to station without the employment of anyconnecting wire.”49 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-319] No doubt the assembled owners of thenew wires carrying Niagara power to New York City did not appreciate thatparticular prophecy.The banquet revealed the joys and wonders of the new electrical age. Withfanfare, the Buffalo Morning Express observed, “Great are the powers ofelectricity. . . . It makes millionaires. It paints devils’ tails in the air andfloats placidly in the waters of the earth. It hides in the air. It creeps intoevery living thing. . . . Last night it nestled in the sherry. It lurked in thepale Rhine wine. It hid in the claret and sparkled in the champagne. It trembledin the sorbet electrique. . . . Small wonder that the taste was thrilled and theman who sipped was electrified. . . . Energy begets energy.”50[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-320] As giddy attendees emerged from Buffalo’s Ellicott Club,within what was then the world’s largest office building, “there was not a manwho went home did not feel . . . the glorious knowledge that the introduction ofpower had been commemorated.”51 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-321]Even science fiction writer H. G. Wells expressed wonder at the Niagara project.The “softly humming turbines,” he wrote, “are altogether noble masses ofmachinery, huge black slumbering monsters. . . . There is no clangor, noracket. . . . All these great things are as silent, as wonderfully made, as theheart of a living body, and stouter and stronger than that. . . . I fell into adaydream of the coming power of men, and how that power may be used by them.”52[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-322]After being unceremoniously removed from the General Electric Company, ThomasEdison eventually acknowledged Tesla’s advancement. At the National ElectricalExposition in New York City in May 1895, the Wizard of Menlo Park observed thatthe conference’s power was coming from far-away Niagara Falls and commented: “Tomy mind it solves one of the most important questions associated with electricaldevelopment.” Alexander Graham Bell of telephone fame, also at the New York Citygathering, added: “This long distance transmission of electric power was themost important discovery of electric science that had been made for manyyears.”53 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-323]Tesla clearly had become a scientific superstar, with the New York Timesdeclaring the Niagara project “could be no better evidence of the practicalqualities of his inventive genius.”54 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-324] Another newspaperpraised Tesla’s spirit as “naturally hopeful. . . . He looks to a time whenpower shall be so cheap, so universal, that all labor shall be done by tirelessmachines and every man’s life be thus so much more worth living.”55[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-325] Yet amidst the cheers, some still expressed cautionabout Tesla’s ideas. One reporter observed, “His inventions already show howbrilliantly capable he is, [but his] propositions seem like a madman’s dream ofempire.”56 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-326]Tesla himself wanted to move on, largely to return to the comforts andstimulation of his isolated lab and new experiments. He needed to tilt hisbalance back a bit from admiring a real project, now the status quo, and towardenvisioning the future. The tour of the Niagara power plant also promptedanother of the inventor’s personal quirks, what he called “a curious thing aboutme.” “I cannot stay about big machinery a great while,” said this inventor ofgiant machines. “It affects me very much. The jar of the machinery curiouslyaffects my spine and I cannot stand the strain.”57 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-327]"},{"pageContent":"8. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch8]EARTHQUAKES AND FRIENDS [06_Contents.xhtml#ch8]New York CityDespite the remarkable advances at Niagara, prospects for electricity flickeredat the dawn of the twentieth century. Electric motors powered only one factoryin thirty since manufacturers were reluctant to abandon their steam-powered,belt-driven systems for what they viewed as unreliable generators. Incandescentbulbs—although they released no smoke, consumed no oxygen, and emitted nounpleasant odors—illuminated only one lamp in twenty as most homeowners favoredthe less expensive and more pleasing glow of gas lamps. Even ten years after theWestinghouse-Tesla achievement, electricity served only 8 percent of Americanhomes.As Tesla and Edison moved on to explore other ideas, engineers and marketersfought new battles over electricity. Engineers no longer offered revolutionaryproducts (e.g., incandescent lightbulb) or disruptive approaches (e.g.,alternating current). Instead, power advances in the twentieth century tended tobe incremental, with designers simply providing bigger generators and longertransmission lines.Particularly significant changes occurred in the marketing of power. Mostelectrical entrepreneurs in the early twentieth century believed electricitywould remain a luxury item and that natural gas companies would continue topower most stoves, water heaters, and furnaces. They feared more electricitycustomers would simply require the construction of more generators anddistribution lines, which might increase costs and decrease profits. Thepreferred business plan was to expand slowly in niche markets and to encouragewealthy consumers to deploy more lightbulbs.Was electricity for all or for the wealthy? Would power become a necessity orremain a luxury? Smart money favored small and dispersed generators for mansionsover central power stations for the masses. Even with the advance of alternatingcurrent and the ability for larger generators to transmit electricity overlonger distances, both General Electric and Westinghouse preferred the immediateprofits from selling isolated generators over the uncertainties of marketingelectricity from centralized generators.Yet even those dispersed generators presented challenges. J. P. ­Morgan wantedhis refurbished mansion on Madison Avenue to be the first residence to useEdison’s lights and generator. However, his neighbor, the aristocratic Mrs.James Brown, was not pleased and initially complained about how her house shookas a result of the dynamo in Morgan’s basement. To avoid his neighbor’s wrath,the banker ordered Edison to place thick rubber pads under the machinery and topile sandbags around his cellar walls. Mrs. Brown then declared the generator’sfumes were tarnishing her silver. Morgan responded by purchasing a differentkind of coal. Meanwhile, his in-house system was hardly reliable. Despite anon-site engineer, the electric lights flickered and even cut off regularly,forcing Morgan and his guests to search in the dark for candles and lanterns.Worse, a short-circuited electric wire sparked and prompted a fire thatdestroyed the desk and expensive rug in his library.Despite such problems with small generators, prospects of selling electricityfrom large power plants seemed even dimmer. General Electric focused onmarketing small units to hotels, banks, mills, ironworks, and theaters acrossthe country, while George Westinghouse was winning high-profile contracts toinstall isolated generators at the St. Louis post office and New York StateCapitol.Samuel Insull developed a different vision—bringing power literally to thepeople by piecing together a giant electric grid. Edison’s personal secretarysaw great promise in Tesla’s alternating current and he envisioned buildinglarger generators and creating giant electricity-selling monopolies. When theGeneral Electric merger of 1892 ousted Edison, Insull rejected the new firm’s$36,000-per-year job in favor of a $12,000-a-year position managing the ChicagoEdison Company, one of many struggling electricity-generating firms in the WindyCity. Sensing the potential for greater profits, he abandoned managing GE’sSchenectady Works and its six thousand employees for running a small Chicagofirm that then employed only three hundred.Insull’s genius was in seeing the potential to integrate and optimize thedemands of diverse electricity customers. To obtain a nighttime load, he tookover the isolated street-lighting generators. To obtain a steady demandthroughout the day, he provided special rates to large office buildings andindustries. He contributed to Chicago politicians and won the right to be thesole supplier of power to streetcar companies. As a result, his power plantscould operate regularly and efficiently, thus reducing his costs as well as hisrates, which only increased the demand for his electricity. According to Insull,“Every home, every factory, and every transportation line will obtain its energyfrom one common source, for the simple reason that that will be the cheapest wayto produce and distribute it.”1 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-328]The brilliant marketer inverted contemporary thinking that electricity must be ahigh-priced luxury item. Noting that rates for electricity at the turn of thecentury were almost 50 percent greater than those for gas, he cut prices fromtwenty cents per kilowatt-hour to ten cents in 1897, and he continued every yearuntil prices plummeted to just two-and-one-half cents per kilowatt-hour in1909.2 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-329]As Insull attracted more customers, he also convinced General Electric to buildlarger generators that would replace the size-limited, gasoline-powered,piston-driven engines. In October 1903, GE and ­Chicago Edison opened the FiskStreet Turbine Station that was powered by burning coal and provided aremarkable five megawatts of electricity. The turbine proved to be anengineering wonder since its blades were the first human-made devices to travelfaster than the speed of sound. By 1911, Insull added ten twelve-megawattturbines at the same site.In many ways, Insull and Tesla had much in common. Both were immigrants. Botharrived in the United States with little more than an introduction to ThomasEdison, and their initial sessions with the Wizard of Menlo Park proved to beremarkably similar. Both dressed and spoke well, and both found Edison to bedowdy and unkempt. According to the status-conscious Insull, Edison’s“appearance, as a whole, was not what you would call ‘slovenly:’ it is bestexpressed by the word ‘careless.’ ”3 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-330]Insull, however, held different views on inventing than either Tesla or Edison.Tesla appreciated invention for its own sake. For Edison, innovation could occuronly when competitive entrepreneurs were fighting for an edge. Insull preferredthe security of monopolies. No doubt these utilities electrified the nation but,without competition, they have become risk averse and more reliant on politicsthan on engineering advances. As a result, even though more than a century haspassed, both Edison and Tesla would recognize the basic components of today’selectric grid.Tesla, of course, could not be bothered with marketing electricity or buildingbigger generators. He decided to capitalize on his newfound fame and focus onhigh-frequency research. Rather than sell power to the masses, the inventorsought to provide it for free to the entire world.To attract more publicity and investors, Tesla turned again to Thomas CommerfordMartin, the editor of Electrical Engineer, who agreed to assemble Tesla’swriting and patent applications into a textbook entitled The Inventions,Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla. One reviewer called the publication “averitable bible for all engineers in the field.”4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-331] Thealmost five-hundred-page tome featured chapters on alternating-current motors,single-phase motors, rotating magnetic fields, and poly-phase systems. Martin’scompendium received glowing comments in Book News, Physics Review, and LondonElectrician, and was translated into Russian and German.Particularly noteworthy and prescient was the book’s description of thepotential for wireless transmission “of intelligent signals or perhaps evenpower.” Admitting this idea “consistently fills my thoughts and which concernsthe welfare of all,” Tesla described how wires became unnecessary when a sendingdevice and a receiver are tuned to the same frequency, allowing electricalimpulses to jump between them. This is similar to the striking of one tuningfork causing another in the same frequency to vibrate.Tesla also declared it “practicable to disturb by means of powerful machines theelectrostatic condition of the earth.”5 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-332] Why not have anenlarged Tesla coil send a resonating current through the planet, thereby makingsignals and power available to all, without the need for copper wires? Notingthe myth of Antaeus, the wrestling god who derived power from the earth, Teslaclaimed the idea of wireless electricity transmission was not novel.Yet even Tesla recognized the boldness, and bizarreness, of this suggestion. Headmitted that his friends had encouraged him not to speak in public aboutwireless transmission for fear “such idle and far-fetched speculations wouldinjure me in the opinion of conservative businessmen.”6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-333]Yet in an interview with Arthur Brisbane, a respected reporter with JosephPulitzer’s New York World, the excited inventor couldn’t stop himself andproclaimed: “You would think me a dreamer and very far gone if I should tell youwhat I really hope for. But I can tell you that I look forward with absoluteconfidence to sending messages through the earth without any wires. I have alsogreat hopes of transmitting electric force in the same way without wires.”7[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-334]Tesla became increasingly obsessed by the wireless ideal . . . and he wasincreasingly seen as a dreamer. He focused on resonance and vibration. Studyingthose concepts would help him understand the earth’s electrical capacity and thecharge it might contain if electrified. Just as a sound wave can be reinforcedor prolonged by the introduction of another vibration at the right frequency,Tesla tested various rates of electromagnetic waves. He actually built a smallbox—a receiver composed of several capacitors and an electromagnetic relay—thathe carried around New York City in order to detect vibrations from the­oscillating current produced by the transmitter located in his laboratory. Onsome occasions, he sensed such a current on the roof of the ­Gerlach Hotel,about 1.3 miles from his workshop, but the readings were not consistent, aresult, as he discovered, caused by slight changes in the speed of the steamengine powering the alternator. So to obtain a more constant speed and avoidunwanted vibrations, he experimented with reciprocating generators, which move apiston up and down, as well as various combinations of a steam engine and anelectric generator. Tesla labeled the resulting electric generator an“electro-mechanical oscillator,” although some referred to it as “Tesla’searthquake machine.”One unexpected application of the oscillator had to do with the process ofelimination, as in bowel movements. It seems when people stepped on a platformconnected to this new transmitter they experienced “minute oscillations” that,in the scientist’s graphic words, “stimulated powerfully the peristalticmovements which propel food-stuffs through the alimentary channels.” At first,the sensation was “as strange as agreeable,” but after a time, Tesla and hisassistants “felt an unspeakable and pressing necessity which had to be promptlysatisfied.” Looking for a commercial application, the inventor declared such“mechanical therapy,” if used regularly in short doses, eliminated constipation,flatulence, and other stomach ailments.8 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-335] Tesla latertouted electricity as a cure for dozens of ailments, from hair loss todepression.Mark Twain, who had met Tesla at the exclusive Players’ Club owned by actorEdwin Booth, was the most famous person to try this vibrating therapy. (Teslaand Twain struck up a friendship after the inventor revealed that the writer’searly novels helped him through a sick spell when he was fourteen years old, adisclosure that caused this “great man of laughter [to] burst into tears.”)9[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-336] Complaining one day of “a variety of distressing anddangerous ailments,” Twain initially felt the vibrations provided relief, yet,despite Tesla’s warnings, he stayed a little too long on the platform—and neededto rush to the bathroom. When Twain’s sessions were moderated, however, Teslanoted that “in less than two months he regained his old vigor and ability ofenjoying life to the fullest extent.”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-337]Twain quickly became impressed with Tesla’s scientific prowess, writing to acolleague: “I have just seen the drawings & description of an electrical machinelately patented by a Mr. Tesla, & sold to the ­Westinghouse Company, which willrevolutionize the whole electric business of the world. It is the most valuablepatent since the telephone.”11 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-338] The two enjoyed numerousdinners together, and Twain spent many an evening at Tesla’s lab reviewing theinventor’s latest experiments and comparing notes on a joint venture to developan automatic typesetting machine. Twain even appealed to Tesla for thecommission to sell in Austria and England some of Tesla’s inventions,particularly the radio-controlled boat, discussed later, that the writerdescribed as a “destructive terror.”12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-339]Tesla’s oscillator, when accelerated, could shake buildings. According to thescientist, “I had one of my machines going and I wanted to see if I could get itin tune with the vibration of the building. I put it up notch after notch. Therewas a peculiar cracking sound.”13 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-340] Tesla didn’t realizeit at the time, but the resonance was triggering an artificial earthquake thatshook nearby tenement flats throughout Little Italy and sent its residentsrunning into the street crying “Madredi Dio” and “Gesu Cristo.” Many in theneighborhood had come from Naples, near ­Vesuvius, and feared another disaster.As Tesla continued to increase the frequency in the early evening of August 11,1896, dishes rattled, chairs slid across rooms, and cascading plaster piled upon floors. Out in the street, water gushed from burst mains and telephone polesswayed.An oblivious Tesla continued increasing the frequency until everything aroundhim trembled dramatically, the way that a particular frequency of sound canshatter glass. Inside the laboratory, “suddenly all the heavy machinery in theplace was flying around.” The inventor quickly grabbed a hammer and smashed hisdevice, just before the police arrived and demanded an explanation. “I told myassistants to say nothing,” admitted a deceitful Tesla. “We told the police itmust have been an earthquake. That’s all they ever knew about it.”14[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-341]The police visit did not deter Tesla’s experimenting. He frequently took hisalarm clock–sized oscillator to construction sites. Placing this equipment onthe steel framework of a ten-story structure, Tesla said, “In a few minutes Icould feel the beam trembling. Finally, the structure began to creak and wave,and the steel-workers came to the ground panic-stricken, believing there hadbeen an earthquake.” Boyishly pleased the authorities were again called, hecasually “took off the vibrator, put it in my pocket and went away.” He laterboasted, “I could drop the Brooklyn Bridge into the East River in less than anhour.”15 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-342]Several years later, a magazine quoted Tesla suggesting “he could set theearth’s crust into such a state of vibration that it would rise and fallhundreds of feet and practically destroy civilization.” An accompanyingillustration showed the earth broken in two.16 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-343] Onanother occasion, the inventor asserted he could “split [the earth] as a boywould split an apple—and forever end the career of man.” Bragging about hisnewfound power, he also said: “For the first time in man’s history, he has theknowledge with which he may interfere with cosmic processes!”17[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-344] (The Discovery Channel’s Mythbusters television show inAugust 2006 tried to demonstrate oscillator-provoked vibrations on an oldbridge, but the experimenters measured only a bit of shaking rather than“earth-shattering” effects.)Tesla’s high-speed transmitter evoked less damaging and more practical results.It set the stage, as an example, for a new science of “telegeodynamics” thatlocates ore and petroleum deposits by studying vibrations reflected from stratafar beneath the earth’s surface. His oscillating transformer also couldconcentrate power to melt metals.images [Images/com.jpg]Tesla was at the top of his game in the mid-1890s. He was enjoying creativespurts, friendships, and financing. He was, in a word, balanced. For a man whogrew up in flux, he finally could envision his ideals while being attached topresent realities. When he could stay on that cusp, he was at his best.Tesla was also enjoying life. Having mastered billiards as a student, to thedetriment of his studies, Tesla reveled in snookering his wealthy New Yorkacquaintances. One night at his old haunt, Delmonico’s restaurant, he convincedthe manager he “had never played” but had only watched his friends for a littlewhile. According to the manager, Tesla “was very indignant when he found that wemeant to give him fifteen points. But it didn’t matter much, for he beat us alland got all the money.” The manager continued, “It wasn’t the money we caredabout, but the way he studies out pool in his head, and then beat us, after wehad practiced for years. [It] surprised us.”18 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-345]Tesla, despite the pranks, increasingly presented a cultured and respectedfigure. He spoke several languages and, as one sophisticated acquaintanceremarked, “is widely read in the best literature of Italy, Germany, and Franceas well as much of the Slavic countries, to say nothing of Greek and Latin. Heis particularly fond of poetry and is always quoting Leopardi or Dante or Goetheor the Hungarians or ­Russians. I know of few men of such diversity of generalculture, or such accuracy of knowledge.”19 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-346] According toa journalist, “I believe he could take up any portion of the second part of‘Faust’ and continue the quotation textually page by page.”20[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-347] Tesla had become a celebrity even outside cultured andscientific circles. According to the New York World, a shopkeeper “lowers hisvoice when he speaks of Mr. Tesla, as Boston cab drivers used to lower theirvoices in speaking of [the revered boxer] John L. Sullivan.”21[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-348]Fellow scientists often marveled at Tesla’s insights, even if they didn’t fullyunderstand them. “His work has been of such an advanced order of electricalapplication,” said one, “that comparatively few have a clear idea as to justwhat he has accomplished.”22 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-349]During this upbeat period, Tesla was introduced to Robert and Katharine Johnson,well-connected socialites who operated an intellectual salon in their stylishtownhouse at 327 Lexington Avenue, about a mile from the Gerlach Hotel in theexclusive Murray Hill neighborhood. Although not wealthy, the Johnsons livedthat way, with rooms carpeted in thick Oriental rugs and adorned with a grandpiano, harpsichord, and crystal candelabras designed to resemble Easter lilies.They were a handsome couple, with Robert’s close-cropped black beard andgold-rimmed glasses and Katharine’s red hair and lively manners. By the timeTesla met them, the Johnsons had a teenage son, Owen, and a slightly youngerdaughter, Agnes.Robert—an accomplished poet and author (most notably in the 1920s of hiswell-received memoir entitled Remembered Yesterdays)—served as editor of TheCentury Magazine, one of the country’s most popular monthly journals. TheJohnsons and Tesla enjoyed numerous dinners together, often joined by suchluminary writers as Rudyard Kipling and Mark Twain, the naturalist John Muir,the sculptor August Saint-Gaudens, the pianist Ignace Paderewski, and thethespian/comedian Joe Jefferson. Johnson’s connections and writings proved to beinfluential politically, as when he published John Muir’s reflections on hikingin Yosemite Valley and helped lobby Congress in 1890 to designate the site as anational park. Robert also persuaded Ulysses S. Grant to contribute a series ofarticles in The Century, entitled “Battles and Leaders of the Civil War,” and heedited the first installment of the future president’s classic memoir.Tesla’s relations with Robert and Katharine revealed a jovial and relaxed sideto the usually intense inventor. At Robert’s request, Tesla obtained permissionfrom Zmaj Jovanovich, his favorite Serbian poet whom he considered to be the“Longfellow of that country,” for his works to be featured in The Century. Oneevening in the Johnsons’ living room, Tesla dramatically recited a translationof the poet’s ballad “Luka Filipov,” about the Montenegrin battle of 1874 inwhich the warrior Luka captures an enemy Turk and marches him back to hisprince.One more hero to be partOf the Servians’ glory!Lute to lute and heart to heartTell the homely story:Let the Moslem hide for shame,Trembling like the falcon’s game,Thinking on the falcon’s name—Luka Filipov.23 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-350]From that moment on, Tesla would address Robert as “Dear Luka” and Katharinewould be known as “Mrs. Filipov.”Robert and Tesla exchanged several notes a week, some dealing with the editingof a Tesla article or a request for the inventor to review pieces from otherscientists. Some letters simply arranged logistics for dinners, although theJohnsons, particularly Katharine, extended many more invitations than the busyTesla accepted. Katharine issued regular appeals: “Come and shed the radiance ofyour happy countenance upon us all, especially the Johnsons.”24[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-351] Tesla often apologized for being deep within hislaboratory work, writing, on one occasion: “I fear that if I depart very oftenfrom my simple habits I shall come to grief.”25 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-352] AfterTesla turned down an invitation to vacation with the Johnsons in Maine, Robertwrote jokingly of Tesla’s strict regimentation: “You know it isn’t safe for youto get more than three miles away from Delmonico’s.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-353]On another occasion, Robert gently taunted Tesla for not vacationing by sayingthe scientist was “joined to your idols of copper and steel.”27[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-354]Robert exchanged news with Tesla about his health: “My buncle [or boil] is on myleg and I walk with much difficulty.”28 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-355] And they sharedpublications, poetry, and ideas, with Robert writing, “I am much touched by yourremembrance of me in sending the book on Buddhism. I did not know you wereenlisted on that side of the campaign but now when I read it I shall think ofyou even more frequently than usual—which is by no means seldom, let me assureyou.”29 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-356]Tesla liked the Johnsons to schedule dinners with potential investors, whom theyjokingly referred to in letters among themselves as “the millionaires.” TheJohnsons also arranged for Tesla to meet eligible women. Katharine, forinstance, wrote: “A very charming girl is to be here who wants very much to meetMr. Tesla. A real one, I assure you.”30 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-357] Robert tried adifferent tack: “Mrs. Johnson expects you tomorrow evening when our lovely Mrs.Anthony is to be with us.”31 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-358] Tesla did seem to enjoy acouple of the introduced ladies, as evidenced by his response to one invitation:“I happen to be free this evening. If you have visitors [ordinary mortals] Iwill not come. If you have . . . Mrs. Anthony—I will come. Please confirm.”32[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-359]One of Tesla’s favorite dining companions was Marguerite ­Merrington. A“dramatic author” and pianist, born in England but schooled at a convent inBuffalo, she wrote plays and operas and was considered to be “tall, graceful,and charming.” The inventor often would ask Katharine about the woman’s possibleattendance at parties, once writing, “Remember to suggest Miss Merrington—if shewould come. I know I could be her victim.”33 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-360]Despite his wooing, Tesla kept these relationships, whether with married orsingle women, casual and focused on lively conversation. Speaking of theinventor’s hesitations around acquaintances of the opposite sex, one colleaguesaid, “I fear he will go on in the delusion that woman is generically a Delilahwho would shear him of his locks.”34 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-361] Commenting on thetall and handsome scientist, a reporter observed, “Impressionable maidens wouldfall in love with him at first sight, but he has no time to think ofimpressionable maidens.”35 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-362] Other friends noted that hisaversion to germs and touching other people did little to foster intimaterelationships. A journalist suggested, “Anyone that talks with him for only afew minutes will get the impression that science is his only mistress.”36[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-363] Tesla, moreover, claimed some philosophicaljustification for his sexual reluctance by referencing the writings of SwamiVivekananda—who won notoriety for lecturing at the Columbian Exposition inChicago on world religions and the role Vendantic Prana (life force) and Akasa(ether) played in modern science. In addition to declaring that Buddhisttheories could be “proved mathematically by demonstrating that force and matterare reducible to potential energy,” the inventor claimed the Hindu preacherdeclared chastity offered a clear path to self-discipline and enlightenment.Tesla could be almost scientific about his views on marriage. He suggested anartist, musician, or writer could enjoy both matrimony and achievement, “but aninventor has so intense a nature with so much in it of wild, passionate quality,that in giving himself to a woman he might love, he would give everything, andso take everything from his chosen field.”37 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-364] On anotheroccasion, he observed that “the thinker is confronted with the problem ofperpetuating either the species or the mind.”38 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-365] Suchreasoning, however, could turn to pathos, as when Tesla admitted: “It’s a pity,too, for sometimes we feel so lonely.”39 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-366]Dinners at the Johnson home began at 8 p.m. The slender ­Katharine, bedecked ina Parisian gown and long white gloves, greeted guests when they arrived. Sheregaled each with a comment, perhaps about the season, and then led them intothe drawing room, where she graciously introduced the new arrival to the otherguests, offering kind insights on their common interests. With her lightreddish-blond hair flowing, she’d then glide away back to the front door. Somedescribed her captivated eyes as “slightly coquettish” and displaying “a daringsense of play beneath a wistful stare.”40 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-367] She exhibitedcharm, that mysterious combination of tact, poise, sympathy, and manners.Robert ensured that the servants provided each guest with the drink of his orher choice. The host moved purposefully through the growing crowd, a commandingpresence in his rich dark beard, hair dramatically parted in the middle, andpince-nez spectacles. He sported a long black coat but avoided neckties in favorof white starched collars. Even the “mountain man” John Muir dressed for theoccasions in a three-piece suit, a gold watch chain dangling from his vestpocket.Despite the elegant attire of the gathered, theirs was a relaxed salon andlaughter quickly filled the space. Children Owen and Agnes made briefappearances and then disappeared upstairs.The dining room was more structured. Katharine arranged seat assignments andplaced name cards at each setting. Her own card was at one end of the longtable, where she could direct the servants, with Robert opposite her. On eitherside of her, Katharine positioned her two favorite gentlemen, which on manyevenings were Nikola Tesla and Mark Twain. Other guests were arranged aftercareful consideration of how conversations could flourish.Striving to appear wealthy on a limited budget, the Johnsons’ dining roomfeatured French gray plastered walls with watermelon pink taffeta curtains and agilt mirror over the mantel. The drop-leaf wooden table and chairs were paintedlight green. They did splurge on a pressed tablecloth of white damask and acenterpiece with colorful flowers, even during the winter. A brilliantlypolished silver salad fork was placed next to each plate, with the meat forknext and then the fish fork. On the right side of the plate, on which a dinnernapkin had been folded flat and square, were the meat knife and the fish knifeand then the soup spoon. Katharine made sure Tesla had extra napkins placedbehind his plate so he could further sanitize the silverware.Despite the name cards and six-piece place setting, the Johnsons consideredtheir dinners to be informal so they usually avoided the hors d’oeuvre andentrée, leaving the meal order: soup, fish, roast, salad, dessert, and coffee.The key part of the dinner, from their perspective, was the conversation that onnights with talkers like Twain, Muir, and Tesla wandered wondrously.The Johnsons and Tesla were contemporaries, with Robert being three years older,and Katharine one year older, than Tesla. They provided each other comfort andprotection. Learning Tesla was not feeling well, Robert wrote, “It has been awhole week since we saw you and this time you need cheering up. Come as early aspossible and get cheered. We are in a jolly mood and the fire is lighted on thehearth and we only need you.”41 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-368] The correspondencereveals a warm relationship, Tesla’s most significant outside of his family. Inresponse to a holiday invitation, for instance, Tesla wrote (referring toKatharine by his pet name for her): “I am, as you know, very fond ofmillionaires, but the inducements you offer are so great that I shall put [them]aside . . . to partake in the splendid lunch which Mme. Filipov will [preparefor] Christmas. I want to be at home—327 Lexington Avenue—with my friends, mydear friends—the Johnsons. If you will prepare a dinner for a half dozen andinvite nobody, it will suit me. . . . We shall talk of blessed peace and bemerry until then.”42 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-369]Katharine worried herself over Tesla’s health. During a heat spell, she begged,“I am so troubled about you. . . . I am haunted by the fear that you may succumbto the heat. . . . Find a cool climate. Do not stay in New York.”43[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-370] Robert was more jovial, writing, “The rumor is that youhave melted in your laboratory.”44 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-371]Although the men exchanged most of the notes, Tesla enjoyed flirty but innocentexchanges with the ebullient Mrs. Filipov, which Robert seemed to be aware ofand referenced in his own letters. ­Katharine McMahon Johnson was a strikingbeauty of Irish descent and an accomplished conversationalist. She appeared“poised, with shoulders swept back, her head held erect.” While her hairfeatured a few streaks of gray, she “still exuded an air of youth.”45[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-372]Yet Katharine also was considered selfish, egocentric, and histrionic at times.She had a dominant streak that “not only pulled people to her but manipulatedthem to her needs.”46 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-373] She sometimes viewed the famousscientist as a trophy for her salon, something to impress her friends. In fact,she could be blunt about her social motives. “Another charming lady is to behere who does not believe that you are my friend, that I even know you,” shewrote to Tesla. “I wish to convince her that you are on my list.”47[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-374]According to her daughter, Katharine revealed “an Irish personality” and couldbe “gay and lively and fun loving, but also depressive underneath.” When“Katharine would go into one of her moods, [she would] just stay in her room andwouldn’t come down even for meals.” Agnes also suggested Katharine was attractedto the “imaginative and exciting” Tesla, particularly in comparison to Robert,whom, she said her mother felt was “boring, very formal with old worldmanners . . . a fine old gentleman.” Tesla, Agnes reasoned, “might have broughtmore gaiety into the house.”48 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-375]Katharine might demand Tesla’s appearances, with something like: “Dear Mr.Tesla, I shall expect to see you tomorrow evening.”49 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-376] Orshe could be pleading: “Will you come to see me tomorrow evening and will youtry to come a little early. . . . I want very much to see you and will be reallydisappointed if you do not think my request worthy [of] your consideration.”50[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-377] After a few rejections, she could sound desperate, aswith: “You do not need anybody, inhuman that you are; how strange it is that wecannot do without you.”51 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-378] She also teased, declaring herdesire to be “hypnotized” by Tesla’s presence.52 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-379] Sheeven complained about competing with her husband for the inventor’s attentions,writing: “Why do you not come to see ME instead of always dropping into TheCentury to see Robert? . . . I must have done something to offend you, but what?How can you be indifferent to such devotion?”53 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-380]Tesla often demurred. “I cannot come tomorrow,” he once explained, “because Ialready accepted an important engagement with an English Millionaire. I canthink of you and rejoice—knowing that you are having an agreeable evening.”54[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-381] After apologizing on another occasion for not being ableto drop by, he offered his more typical excuse: “My head is full of thoughts onsome new inventions and I do not dare to interrupt them for fear of losing thethread.”55 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-382] Tesla understood Katharine’s displeasure withhis excuses and recognized her temper; after demurring about a Christmas dinnerinvitation, for instance, he wrote to Robert: “Your charming wife is evidentlydispleased. If she were not Irish I would remonstrate, but under thecircumstances I can do no more than wait till her ire is spent.”56[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-383]To compensate for his absences, Tesla would invite the Johnsons periodically outfor nights on the town, such as the gala performance of Dvorak’s New WorldSymphony. “Nothing better than the 15th row!” he lamented in an invitation toRobert. “Very sorry, we shall have to use telescopes. But I think the better forMrs. Johnson’s vivid imagination. Dinner at Delmonico’s.”57[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-384]Tesla greatly enjoyed Katharine’s company and their banter. He usually addressedher formally, often as “Mrs. Johnson” or “Mrs. Filipov,” but on a few occasionsit was “Cher Mademoiselle Johnson,”58 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-385] when writing hisletters in French, or “my dear Kate.”59 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-386] According to amutual friend, Katharine’s “spell is now a potent one, I fancy, with him, so faras any woman’s can be, next [to] his sisters.”60 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-387] Yetnothing seemed to be hidden from Robert. Once when Katharine sent flowers toTesla commemorating the Serbian Christmas, Tesla responded to her husband: “Ihave to thank Mrs. Johnson for the magnificent flowers. I havenever . . . received flowers [before], and they produced upon me a curiouseffect.”61 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-388]The Johnsons frequently visited Tesla’s laboratory, which they described as the“magician’s den” where, according to Robert, “lightning-like flashes ofelectrical fire of the length of fifteen feet were an every-day occurrence, andhis tubes of electric light were used to make photographs of many of his friendsas a souvenir of their visits.”62 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-389] Johnson and Mark Twainwere among the first to be photographed with phosphorescent light, and Robertbecame “the medium of the passage of an electric current of a million volts ofthe Tesla system of high frequency, whereas I believe twenty-five hundred voltsof the ordinary current is sufficient to kill. Lamps were thus lit brilliantlythrough my body.”63 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-390]Robert even wrote and published a poem entitled “In Tesla’s Laboratory”:Here in the dark what ghostly figures press!—No phantom of the Past, or grim or sad;No wailing spirit of woe; no specter, cladIn white and wandering cloud, whose dumb distressIs that its crime it never may confess;No shape from the strewn sea; nor they that addThe link of Life and Death,—the tearless mad,That live nor die in dreary nothingness:But blessed spirits waiting to be born—Thoughts to unlick the fettering chains of Things;The Better Time; the Universal Good.Their smile is like the joyous break of morn;How fair, how near, how wistfully they brood!Listen! That murmur is of angels’ wings.64 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-391]As Tesla did with journalists and possible investors, he treated the Johnsons tohis constant financial hopefulness. “My new machine will be a wonder,” he wrotein a typical letter. “There are millions in it.”65 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-392] Inanother note the inventor declared his talent “can be transformed into car-loadsof gold. I am doing that now.”66 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-393] Tesla also declared,“You will be pleased to know that I am successfully developing my undertakingsand the time for that notice from my bankers [about my new wealth] is near athand.”67 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-394]In addition to articles by Johnson in The Century, Tesla in the mid-1890s wasfeatured regularly in the New York Times, New York Herald, and New York World,as well as regional papers—such as the Detroit News and Savannah MorningNews—across the country. The inventor sought such attention, yet he tried toconvey modesty. “It is an embarrassment to me,” he claimed to one reporter,“that my work has attracted as much public attention, [in part] because Ibelieve that an earnest man who loves science more than all should let his workspeak for him.”68 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-395]Still, awards followed the publicity. The Franklin Institute in ­Philadelphia in1893 bestowed upon him the Elliott Cresson Gold Medal, and Columbia Universityand Yale University followed with honorary doctorates.Notoriety also attracted some financing. Edward Dean Adams, the engineer andinvestor who organized the syndicate of Wall Street banks that underwrote theNiagara Falls hydroelectric project, now joined forces with Tesla. In February1895, they formed the Nikola Tesla ­Company to “manufacture and sell machinery,generators, motors, electrical apparatus, etc.”69 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-396] Thefirm appeared to have bright commercial prospects with Tesla’s technicaladvances on cold light (fluorescent bulbs), high-frequency oscillators, andradio transmissions."},{"pageContent":"9. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch9]FIRE AND ROBOTS [06_Contents.xhtml#ch9]New York CityThe good times would not last. Adams was far too busy with other projects toprovide the critical business guidance that Charles Peck once offered to thequixotic Tesla. Even during their infrequent encounters, the financier and theinventor did not bond. Adams was not a modest man and his biographer claimed thefinancier had helped “struggling geniuses who afterward saw [with] clearer eyesand performed with greater zeal and skill because they took counsel with EdwardDean Adams.”1 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-397] Tesla, as a result, was becominguntethered from realism; he lacked checks on his envisioning.Unfortunately, Tesla also suffered from bad timing. With the world’s economiesstruggling to emerge from the Panic of 1893 and the United States on the vergeof bankruptcy, investors were extremely cautious toward any new venture. Morecritically, Tesla could not stop dreaming. Rather than manufacture practicalproducts like more efficient lamps, his passion remained inventing, and he wasbecoming fixated with transmitting messages and power through the earth.No doubt Tesla’s genius was his ability to view challenges from new angles.While Marconi, Hertz, and other wireless forerunners were trying to sendelectromagnetic waves through the atmosphere, Tesla looked to the ground.Describing Tesla as a maverick thinker, one ­technology historian observed,“Just as in an AC motor he had decided to have the magnetic field change in therotor rather than in the stator, now he decided that the ground current shouldtransmit energy and the electromagnetic waves should simply serve as the returnneeded to complete the circuit.”2 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-398]So while Westinghouse was completing the Niagara Falls project in the mid-1890s,Tesla was asking: Why not take advantage of the earth’s natural resonantfrequency to propel electricity everywhere on the planet? Why not pump atriggering amount of power into the ground in order to transmit electricity,sound, and data around the world? Why not send waves of current into the earth,have a receiver extract them, and then transmit electromagnetic waves throughthe atmosphere to complete the circuit? Tesla realized he would need a morepowerful oscillator.What he really needed was rest. The mental strain of inventing and fundraisingwas showing, with one reporter observing the “pallid, drawn, and haggardappearance of [his] face.”3 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-399] Tesla admitted, “I amcompletely worn out, yet I cannot stop my work. These experiments of mine are soimportant, so beautiful, so fascinating, that I can hardly tear myself away fromthem to eat, and when I try to sleep I think about them constantly. I expect Ishall go on until I break down altogether.”4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-400]He was tipped over the edge suddenly on March 13, 1895, beginning at 2:30 in themorning when a fire swept through his Fifth Avenue laboratory. Although notinjured, having been asleep at his hotel, Tesla lost everything, including hisequipment and notes. The uninsured scientist was, according to ElectricalReview, “utterly disheartened and broken in spirit. . . . Nikola Tesla, one ofthe world’s greatest electricians, returned to his rooms in the Gerlachyesterday morning [after reviewing the damage] and took to his bed. He has notrisen since. He lies there, half sleeping, half waking. He is completelyprostrated.”5 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-401] Tesla told the New York Times, “I am intoo much grief to talk. What can I say? The work of half my lifetime, verynearly; all my mechanical instruments and scientific apparatus, that has takenyears to perfect, swept away in a fire that lasted only an hour or two. How canI estimate the loss in mere dollars and cents? Everything is gone.”6[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-402]The fire had started in the downstairs storeroom for Gillis & ­Geoghegan,manufacturers of steamfitter supplies, which often were soaked in oil. Onenewspaper suggested a careless night watchman, named Mahoney, discarded astill-burning cigarette, and although he tried to douse the blaze using pails ofwater, the oil-soaked materials burned like a tinderbox. Firemen made littleheadway against the intense heat, which destroyed the six-story building andeven damaged the nearby elevated railroad.Examining the stark devastation, a reporter described the scene: “Two totteringbrick walls and the yawning jaws of a somber cavity aswim with black water andoil were all that could be seen [that fateful] morning . . . of a laboratorywhich to all who had visited it was one of the most interesting spots onearth.”7 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-403]Charles A. Dana, then managing editor of the New York Tribune, suggested theloss of Tesla’s temple of invention had international ramifications. “Thedestruction of Nikola Tesla’s workshop, with its wonderful contents, issomething more than a private calamity,” he wrote. “It is a misfortune to thewhole world. It is not in any degree an exaggeration to say that the men livingat this time who are more important to the human race than this young gentlemancan be counted on the fingers of one hand; perhaps on the thumb of one hand.”8[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-404]The fire’s greatest misfortune, however, might have been to delay Tesla’sefforts, particularly on the wireless transmission of intelligence, or radio. Inthe race to discovery, this postponement afforded ­Guglielmo Marconi anopportunity to advance unchallenged his devices and patents.Tesla suffered debilitating depression, which he battled, appropriately enough,through electricity or, more specifically, electrotherapy. It was not unusual atthe time to deploy mild shocks to treat an array of ailments—“promote heartaction and digestion, induce healthful sleep, rid the skin of destructiveexudations, and cure colds and fever by the warmth they create”—but Teslaaccelerated the treatments over several months in order to avoid “sinking into astate of melancholia.” Each morning he would disrobe, stand naked upon his“vitality booster,” and administer higher and higher doses. He later declaredelectricity “puts into the tired body just what it most needs—life force, nerveforce. It’s a great doctor, I can tell you, perhaps the greatest of alldoctors.”9 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-405] Claiming credit for the procedure’sdevelopment and popularity, he bragged, “Leaders in the profession have assuredme that I have done more for humanity by this medical treatment than all myother discoveries and inventions.”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-406]Despite the staggering setback and mental strain, Tesla struggled back. Don’tforget that Tesla had endured depression and cholera some twenty years before.Showing compassion, Edison offered his own laboratory temporarily to thedistraught scientist, and within two months of the fire, Tesla was ordering newequipment from Westinghouse. (Ironically, it was Edison, Tesla’s frequentcompetitor, who offered space for free while the Westinghouse Company, which hadprofited so much from Tesla’s inventions, began to bill him for equipment lostin the fire and to charge him for new machinery.) “I am so very anxious to beginanew my interrupted experiments,” he wrote to Pittsburgh officials. “This kindof work is almost essential to my health, and I hope that its resumption willhave a good effect upon me.”11 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-407] Over the next few months,the inventor kept up a regular stream of equipment replacement orders, usuallyrequesting haste. In one letter, he wrote: “Will you kindly forward, as speedilyas possible, rings of sheet iron, 9-1/2 inches inside, and 11 inches outsidediameter. The thickness of the sheet iron should be between 1/64 and 1/32 of aninch, or whatever thickness you use in your armatures. The iron should be of thehighest quality and best annealed, and I shall want about 100 pounds of theseplates.”12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-408]Tesla expressed flexibility, and Westinghouse offered sympathy. When ordering amotor, for instance, the scientist said, “I may use a machine of say 110 voltsif one should be in stock. Furthermore, I am not limited exactly as to thecapacity, and it might be something more than 25 H.P, but not very much more.”13[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-409] Company officials responded, “The order will receive ourbest attention.” A Westinghouse vice president compassionately added, “I haveregretted every time I have thought of your misfortune that you should have metwith such a loss. I am very glad to know that you took off your coat and went towork again.”14 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-410]As he rebuilt his workshop, Tesla also rebuilt his relationship with GeorgeWestinghouse, who was losing control of his company to bankers who felt far lessgenerous to Tesla. The businessman invited Tesla to come again to Pittsburgh to“observe the operation of your motors in daily practice as well as to get acomprehension of our facilities.”15 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-411] The two exchangedregular notes about job seekers or about logistics for meeting representativesof the U.S. Navy or Prince Albert of Belgium. Tesla increasingly was confidentand bold enough to suggest strategies to protect his patents and bolster hisreputation: “I am prompted by a feeling of friendship to point out to youpersonally that your advertisements do not bring out clearly the fact that thesepatents cover not one, but a number of lines of almost equivalentimportance. . . . You can readily see that with a few words your statements maybe rendered much stronger, and will more exactly express the state of things.”16[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-412] The ever diplomatic Westinghouse responded quickly: “Weare anxious to give as much prominence as possible to every feature inconnection with your inventions.”17 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-413]The equipment arrived at a new workshop Tesla rented on two floors of 46 EastHouston Street, located just east of Greenwich Village. While focused onwireless transmissions, the inventor kept his eyes open for new opportunities.Slightly before Wilhelm Roentgen in December 1895 announced his discovery ofX-rays, Tesla witnessed the effects of electrical discharge tubes on film, buthe didn’t recognize the significance of this new form of energy. “Too late,”Tesla lamented later. “I realized that my guiding spirit had again prompted meand that I had failed to comprehend his mysterious signs.”18[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-414]After reading Roentgen’s articles, Tesla quickly repeated and expanded on theGerman physicist’s experiments. It’s possible that Tesla took the first X-rayimage, this one of Mark Twain’s hand. Such “black light and very specialradiation,” Tesla said, fashioned “Shadowgraphs” on plates inside metalcontainers. In one exposure of forty minutes, he revealed “not only the outline,but the cavity of the eye, the lower jaw and connections to the upper one, thevertebral column, and connections to the skull, the flesh and even the hair.”19[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-415] Initially dismissing the dangers, he came to realizethat radiation produced bad headaches for himself and severe blistering and skininflammation for an assistant.Tesla also devised several innovative devices to produce X-rays, and he claimedhis instruments would “enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greaterpower than obtainable with ordinary apparatus.”20 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-416]Several years before observations by quantum physicists, he also suggestedinsightfully that these powerful energy rays had both particle-like andwave-like properties. X-rays, he further observed, provided a wonderful “gun tofire, projecting missiles of a thousand fold greater penetrative power than thatof a cannon ball, and carrying them probably to distances of many miles.”21[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-417]Thomas Edison also came to recognize the usefulness of this newfound energy, andhe focused particularly on how X-rays could cause the blind to “see a light.”Tesla expressed skepticism of that claim, asking, “Is it not cruel to raise suchhopes when there is so little ground for it? What possible good can result?”22[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-418] Reporters responded by trying to provoke another battlebetween the electrical wizards, with headlines suggesting “Tesla OpposesEdison.”23 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-419] The argument, however, was short-lived as theKentucky School of Medicine combined their devices to examine the birdshot in awounded person’s foot, finding “every bone was distinctly shown, and the shot,about thirty in number, were plainly located.” The sometimes combatants andsometimes friends celebrated by enjoying a day of fishing, sponsored by theSafety Insulated Wire and Cable Company, on a topsail schooner off Sandy Hook.According to one press report, they were “as happy and well satisfied a party asever rode the waves of the Atlantic’s billows,” with Tesla nabbing “a flounderof large dimensions [and] Edison caught a shocking big fluke.”24[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-420]images [Images/com.jpg]Recognizing that numerous other scientists and well-financed companies werebeginning to dabble with X-rays, Tesla returned to concentrate on wirelesstransmissions. It was during this period in late 1896 and early 1897 thatWestinghouse flipped the switch at the Niagara Falls generating station andTesla received praise at ­Buffalo’s Ellicott Club. Tesla’s mind, however, waselsewhere as his wireless efforts opened a totally new field that he called“telautomatics” (which we now refer to as “robotics”). He predictedelectromechanical devices could be regulated from a distance without interveningwires and, more remarkably, to even think for themselves.The inventor’s initial project was a radio-controlled model boat, measuringapproximately four feet in length and three feet high, which could receiveelectromagnetic signals from a transmitter. Other engineers had devisedrudimentary wireless systems that transmitted in only one frequency, yet Tesladeveloped an extraordinary disk that could distinguish among multiple signalsand direct an independent boat to flash its lights, rotate the rudder, as wellas engage the propeller. “The mechanism found in this invention is among themost sophisticated devices Tesla created in his career,” declared a scientifichistorian. “And up to 1897, no one had conceived of using electromagnetic wavesto operate an unmanned vehicle; Tesla introduced the idea into popular cultureand engineering practice.”25 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-421]Ever the showman, Tesla arranged for the telautomaton’s debut at the massiveMoorish-style Madison Square Garden during the Electrical Exposition in May1898, three months after the Spanish sank the battleship Maine in Havana Harbor.The inventor had erected a small indoor pond and invited scientists, possibleinvestors, and the general public, whom he tantalized with progressivelyentertaining demonstrations. After directing the battery-powered boat to motoraround the pool, moving it backward and forward, causing it to dance like awater bug, he asked mesmerized audience members to ask the vessel a question.When one wanted to know the cube root of sixty-four, Tesla ­quietly flickedlevers on a small box hidden next to his podium that made the boat’s lightsflash four times. “It created a sensation,” he remarked, “such as no otherinvention of mine has ever produced.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-422]Shocked witnesses to Tesla’s demonstration assumed the iron-hulled model movedby magic, telepathy, or, according to one observer, a trained monkey hiddeninside the small vessel.27 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-423] Even government officialsexpressed skepticism. When Tesla tried to offer the ­invention to a militaryofficer, “he burst out in laughter. . . . Nobody thought then that there was thefaintest prospect of perfecting such a device.”28 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-424]Moreover, after reading Tesla’s startling patent submission, entitled “Method ofand apparatus for controlling mechanisms of moving vessels or vehicles,” theskeptical chief examiner traveled to New York in November 1898 to see theinvention for himself . . . and quickly approved the application.Using military terms in order to attract a Navy contract, Tesla admitted hisnext telautomaton, what he called a “torpedo boat without a crew,” sounded“almost incredible.” Nonetheless, he declared, “My submarine boat, loaded withits torpedoes, can start out from a protected bay or be dropped over a ship’sside, make its devious way below the surface, through dangerous channels of minebeds, into protected harbours and attack a fleet at anchor. . . . Through allthese wonderful evolutions it will be under the absolute and instant control ofa distant human hand on a far-off headland, or on a war ship whose hull is belowthe horizon and invisible to the enemy.”29 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-425] The inventoralso devised a loop antenna that could be enclosed in the vessel’s hull,allowing the boat to submerge, become invisible, yet still receive signals. Hefiled for patents in thirteen countries.According to the New York Sun, the small robotic boat would “revolutionizewarfare.”30 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-426] Tesla, ever the optimist, claimed, “Itsadvent introduces into warfare an element which never existed before—a fightingmachine without men as a means of attack and defense. The continuous developmentin this direction must ultimately make war a mere contest of machines withoutmen and without loss of life.”31 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-427] In an article entitled“Torpedo to Revolutionize Warfare,” he is quoted as saying, “We shall be able,availing ourselves of this advance, to send a projectile at a much greaterdistance; it will not be limited in any way by weight or amount of explosivecharge; we shall be able to submerge it at command, to arrest it in its flightand call it back, and to send it out again and explode it at will; and more thanthis, it will never make a miss.”32 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-428]The telautomaton, Tesla alternatively proposed, “will tend to bring about andmaintain peace among nations.” Through demonstrations and interviews, theinventor described how his tub-like boat could destroy battleships, but heclaimed to have “no desire that my fame should rest on the invention of a merelydestructive device.” He announced, “I prefer to be remembered as the inventorwho succeeded in abolishing war.” Armed battles, he suggested, “will cease to bepossible when all the world knows tomorrow that the most feeble of nations cansupply itself immediately with a weapon which will render its coast secure andits ports impregnable to the assaults of the united armadas of the world.”33[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-429]Tesla’s success was further highlighted by Marconi’s failure. The Italian haddevised his own wireless detonation system. In a separate pool he placed a modelfrigate that was to blow up when it came near a “Spanish ship.” Unfortunately,Marconi had not figured out how to send individualized messages on differentfrequencies so when his assistant—actually Thomas Edison’s son, TomJunior—pushed a button on his control box, an explosion rocked a back room thatstored Marconi’s miniature bombs, sending shocks and smoke throughout theexhibition hall.Tesla’s imagination, not surprisingly, envisioned something grander than just arobotic boat or weapon. “Had I accomplished nothing more than [a torpedo steeredwithout wires], I should have made a small advance indeed,” he said. “But theart I have evolved does not contemplate merely the change of direction of amoving vessel; it affords a means of absolutely controlling, in every respect,all the innumerable translator movements, as well as the operations of all theinternal organs, no matter how many, of an individualized automaton.”34[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-430] When a reporter called the boat a weapon of war, Teslasternly countered: “You do not see there a wireless torpedo. You see there thefirst of a race of robots, mechanical men which will do the laborious work ofthe human race.”35 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-431]Even Tesla’s U.S. patent application foresaw broad applications, noting that thewireless device could control “boat, balloon, or carriage”; be operated bydirect conduction through the earth or by electromagnetic radiation through theair; and be used “for other scientific, engineering, or commercial purposes.”From our modern perspective, the ­telautomaton combined advancements in wirelesstransmission and selective tuning and represented one of the great technological­achievements of the late nineteenth century. By using combinations of radiowaves in different frequencies, something Tesla called “individualization,” hecould coordinate tuning devices in order to transmit multiple signals andprevent interference—a major advancement over Marconi’s efforts. As a result ofTesla’s work, a sender could be confident a message would be obtained only bythe intended receiver and would also be decipherable amidst the cacophony ofunrelated radio traffic.Tesla obtained this individualization by placing two circuits within the boatand tuning and combining them “so as to cause the operation of the controllingmechanism when both of these circuits were energized by their respectivevibrations” from his oscillating transformer.36 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-432] As aresult, he could generate scores of separate frequencies and control multiplevessels simultaneously.For Tesla, the robot further characterized a mechanical creation that couldthink. Independent of any operator and left entirely to itself, he said, afuture telautomaton would be able “to perform, in response to externalinfluences affecting its sensitive organs, a great variety of acts andoperations as if it had intelligence.”37 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-433] Going one stepfurther, the robotic boat represented to Tesla the first nonbiological form oflife, a machine “embodied” with a “borrowed mind”—his own. Forseeing artificialintellgence, the telautomaton not only would be able “to follow a course laidout or . . . obey commands given far in advance, it will be capable ofdistinguishing between what it ought and what it ought not to do.”38[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-434]Electrical Review proclaimed the radio-controlled boat to be one of the “mostpotent factors in the advance of civilization of mankind.” Yet such boldpronouncements, even if accompanied by a rather remarkable working model, didnot impress some of Tesla’s scientific contemporaries. Cyrus Brackett, aPrinceton physics professor, scoffed, “There is nothing new about this. Thetheory is perfect, but the application is absurd. . . . Do you suppose that inthe din of battle it would be possible to put into execution those minute andcarefully adjusted mechanical experiments, all of which are presupposed by histheory, which require the quiet of an uninterrupted laboratory to worksuccessfully?”39 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-435] Amos Dolber of Tufts College grumbled,“He is getting to be like the man who called ‘Wolf! wolf!’ until no one listenedto him. Mr. Tesla has failed so often before that there is no call to believethese things until he really does them.”40 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-436]Even his friend Thomas Commerford Martin at the Electrical ­Engineer was growingweary of Tesla’s unfulfilled claims for cold lighting, radio, and wireless powertransmissions; he complained, “Within the last year or two Mr. Tesla has, itseems to us, gone far beyond the possible in the ideas he has put forth, and hehas today behind him a long trail of beautiful but unfinished inventions.”41[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-437] Martin’s dismissal of Tesla’s latest work was no doubtaggravated by the editor’s mounting interest in other inventors. Needing new anddramatic stories for his magazine, Martin became particularly intrigued with thewireless efforts of ­Marconi. In fact, he pushed to have Edison’s son, TomJunior, become Marconi’s representative in the United States, an effective wayfor the Italian to obtain more credibility for his patents and strengthen hisclaim to being the true wireless pioneer.The growing strain was not only personal but also financial. ­Martin’s 1893compilation of Tesla’s speeches and patent applications had been a relativelypopular publication, but the inventor promptly borrowed and never returnedMartin’s profits, causing the journalist to complain that “two years of workwent for nothing.”42 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-438] Tesla, who could get testy, did notappreciate such criticism. Demanding “a complete and humble apology,” he huffilywrote: “On more than one occasion you have offended me, but in my qualities bothas Christian and philosopher I have always forgiven you and only pitied you foryour errors. This time, though, your offense is graver than the previous ones,for you have dared to cast a shadow on my honor.”43 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-439]Although some of the carping can be attributed to competitive and enviousscientists, as well as to growing conflicts among rival journals, even Teslarecognized the truth within some of the criticism. He embraced being an idealistand declared, “I want to go down to posterity as the founder of a new method ofcommunication. I do not care for practical results in the immediate present.”More telling, Tesla did little to push government or millionaire investors toadvance his remote-control electronics and multichannel broadcasting systems.­Undisturbed, the inventor saw his role as revealing principles while leaving itto others to develop the associated applications.44 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-440]Not long after introducing his robot-controlled boat, Tesla was introduced bythe Johnsons to Richard Pearson Hobson, a Naval Academy graduate, maritimeengineer, and a southerner from a prominent family who had worked for the Officeof Naval Intelligence. Hobson also had experience with naval warfare. In earlyJune 1898, near the beginning of the Spanish-American War, the young lieutenantdrove the frigate Merrimac on a “dash” into Santiago Harbor under “a livelycannonade of fire” in order to attack the Spanish armada. According to anewspaper account, “Everyone is astounded at the audacity of the Americanvessel.”45 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-441] Hobson, it seems, deliberately scuttled hisvessel in order to lock Admiral Cervera and his fleet in the harbor. Althoughcaptured and imprisoned in the dungeon of Morro Castle, Hobson became an instantcelebrity, with another newspaper proclaiming: “In a day, in an hour, thepotent, all-pervading force of electricity . . . flashed his fame over the roundworld.”46 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-442] (Several years later, Hobson received theMedal of Honor for his bravery.)The famous and muscular officer—striking in his uniform and possessing deep-seteyes, prominent chin, thick beard, and handlebar mustache—often shared dinnerwith Tesla at the Johnsons’, and the two exchanged regular notes, with Hobson inone suggesting: “Now, my dear fellow, if you are doing nothing over the next ¾of an hour come over for a short tête-à-tête—I feel I have not seen half enoughof you on this visit and I have so much to talk with you about.”47[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-443]Tesla even bantered with the Johnsons over access to the good-looking militaryhero. The scientist wrote to Robert using their pet names: “Remember, Luka,Hobson does not belong to the Johnsons exclusively. I shall avenge myself onMme. Filipov by introducing him to Mme. ­Kussner and somebody will beforgotten.”48 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-444] He separately teased ­Katharine: “We mustexhibit Hobson. I know he likes me better than you.”49 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-445]Tesla found Hobson to be “a fine fellow” who possessed a keen mind.50[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-446] The two spent “delightful” hours together in thelaboratory and at the movies. For Tesla, Hobson offered male companionship,perhaps a substitute for Anthony Szigeti, while Hobson enjoyed the intellectualexchanges about boats, science, and wireless transmissions.images [Images/com.jpg]In response to the criticism from a few journalists and scientists, the lack ofcommercial prospects for his automatons, and the encouragement of Hobson andother friends, Tesla decided to return to focusing on his one big idea—wirelesstransmissions. Taking to heart Lord Rayleigh’s recommendation in 1892 to addresssomething grand, Tesla rejected the scientific consensus about Hertzian orelectromagnetic waves moving through the atmosphere and doubled down on sendingmessages and power by electrostatic forces [referring to static electriccharges], preferably through the earth, which he claimed to be the “ideal methodof transmission.”51 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-447]Tesla could display a competitive spirit when it came to this grand ideal.Comparing his wireless approach to the Hertz-wave system, he said, “The firstenables us to transmit economically energy to any distance and is of inestimablevalue; the latter is capable of a radius of only a few miles and is worthless.”(He had made similar distance comparisons between his alternating-current andEdison’s direct-current arrangements.) Although claiming not to have the“slightest ill-feeling” toward other experimenters, he snidely suggested “howmuch better it would have been if the ingenious men . . . had invented somethingof their own instead of depending on me altogether.”52 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-448]Achieving Tesla’s goal of wireless transmission required raising even furtherthe voltage and frequency from his coils. Within the Hudson Street laboratory,he increased his system’s output to a remarkable four million volts, whichgenerated stunning sixteen-foot sparks. By early 1895, he also detectedoscillations from his lab-based transmitter at West Point, more than fifty milesup the Hudson River, a noteworthy achievement. Yet he still didn’t fullyunderstand how to create “a ­transmitter of adequate power” that might “bridgethe greatest terrestrial distances.”53 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-449] To address thatchallenge, Tesla needed to leave the laboratory, “to go into the open” and builda larger project."},{"pageContent":"10. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch10]LIKE A GOD CONTROLLING NATURE’S POWER [06_Contents.xhtml#ch10]Colorado SpringsIn his search for more space to generate bigger lightning bolts, Tesla asked foradvice from his patent attorney, whose law partner, ­Leonard Curtis, suggestedColorado Springs, about sixty miles south of ­Denver. Curtis, who had moved tothe area a few years before in order to enjoy its crisp air and dry climate,argued the mile-high town’s thin atmosphere would be particularly conducive tothe wireless transmission of power and messages. A bit of a local booster,Curtis enticed the famous scientist with free power at night from El Paso PowerCompany, the local utility with which he was associated.Curtis recommended Knob Hill—a slight rise within a cow pasture on the city’seastern outskirts, not far from the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind—for asixty-by-seventy-foot barn that would serve as an office and experimentalstation. He arranged for a local carpenter to design a telescoping mast thatcould raise a thirty-inch-diameter, copper-covered ball up to 142 feet, atwenty-five-foot tower to stabilize the mast, as well as a retracting roof thatwould help prevent the laboratory from catching on fire when Tesla’s electricalstreamers soared.Tesla also needed financing, and he set his sights on John Jacob Astor IV, amember of Teddy Roosevelt’s Rough Riders and a great-grandson of the wealthy furtrader and real-estate investor. “Jack” Astor was a likely target because hisassets of some ninety million dollars were three times those of J. P. Morgan,and he appreciated inventors, noting his own patents for a bicycle brake,pneumatic walkway, and storage battery. Like Tesla, Astor also enjoyedprophecies, as evidenced by the science fiction novel he wrote in 1894, at theage of thirty, about space travel, entitled A Journey in Other Worlds. Yet Astorwas known as an aimless dilettante, and not a nice one at that. A biographerdescribed him as “cold-hearted, humorless, weak-minded and almost completelyabsent of personality.”1 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-450]Tesla proved to be a better inventor than fundraiser. During a couple ofmeetings in New York City, Astor made it quite clear any investment he mightmake should help develop and market a new and profitable lighting system, yetthe scientist persistently asked that the funds be used for his wireless powerexperiments. In addition to not respecting his investor’s wishes, Teslaundiplomatically told Astor: “I am often and violently attacked because myinventions threaten a number of established industries,” a statement thatprobably did not endear him to a cautious investor in those enterprises. Teslaeven informed this militaristic Rough Rider that his inventions would “renderlarge guns entirely useless, and will make impossible the building of largebattleships.”2 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-451]Astor, not surprisingly, would have none of it, at least initially. “You aretaking too many leaps for me,” complained the investor. “Let us stick tooscillators and cold lights [the precursor of florescent lamps]. Let me see somesuccess in the marketplace with these two enterprises, before you go off savingthe world with an invention of an entirely different order, and then I willcommit more than my good wishes.”3 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-452]Not discouraged, Tesla responded with blandishment, calling Astor “a princeamong wealthy men, a patriot ready to risk his life for his country, a man whomeans every word he says.” Such flattery prompted the egotistical investor tobegin negotiating. “Your letter offering me some of your oscillator stock [hasbeen] received,” he wrote. “ 95 [dollars per share] seems rather a high price;for though the inventions covered by the stock will doubtless bring about greatchanges, they may not pay for some time as yet, and, of course, there are alwaysa good many risks.”4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-453]After the scientist lowered his price, promised to focus on fluorescent lights,and obtained small risk-reducing contributions from George Westinghouse andEdward Dean Adams, Astor agreed to provide one hundred thousand dollars(equivalent to almost three million dollars today) for five hundred shares ofTesla Electric Company and a seat on the board of directors. (Tesla’s subsequentdiversion of funds to his wireless project would prompt Astor to stop paymentsafter his first installment of thirty thousand dollars.)With a site and financing, Tesla, then almost forty-three years old, made hismove in May 1899. On his way by train to Colorado, the inventor stopped inChicago to address the Commercial Club, composed of the city’s thirty-two mostpowerful businessmen. Showing an “apparent difficulty in expressing his ideas,”Tesla’s “disjointed and disconnected” speech suggested that the inventor waslosing some of his magic. Club members, reported one journalist, were “greatlymystified by the lecture and the experiments.” Misreading his audience, whowanted to understand investment opportunities associated with electricity, Teslabegan vaguely: “There is no one who does not speculate about the questions ofhis existence, asking whence he comes, whither he is going and what in realityhe is.”5 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-454]Having missed a golden opportunity to raise more money in ­Chicago, Teslatraveled on to Colorado Springs, where he moved into room 207 (divisible bythree) of the Alta Vista Hotel, within walking distance of the new ColoradoSprings lab. His windows looked out over the Rocky Mountains, and the hotelsupplied him each morning with eighteen fresh towels. Town leaders welcomed thescience celebrity with a grand banquet at the El Paso Club, where the inventorsuggested he would be conducting wireless telegraphy experiments and trying tosend signals from Pikes Peak to Paris. “I propose,” he added, “to propagateelectrical disturbances without wires.”6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-455]While Tesla moved to Colorado, George Scherff, his office manager, stayed in NewYork to supervise a team of craftsmen. Virtually each day, the two exchangedletters or telegrams, with the scientist frequently drawing diagrams for how hewanted equipment devised. Far away from friends and social activities, Teslacraved contact, asking Scherff to “write as often as possible”7[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-456] and “make your correspondence more interesting.”8[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-457] He also issued his directives firmly: “All work must bedone first class. Tell the workmen not to lose sight of this.”9[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-458] Despite imposing such pressure, Tesla inspired hisstaff, with Scherff commending “your wonderful work [in Colorado], and we knowthat, instead of a century, you are a thousand years ahead of the others.”10[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-459]Most of the manager’s notes responded to the scientist’s instructions: “Thesketches mentioned were not quite ready last night and could only be mailed thismorning,” Scherff wrote in one of the regular updates. “The work on thecondenser is being pushed. Mr. Clark is milling down the teeth of the disk forthe break. . . . Willy has finished grinding out the necks of the bottles and isnow making salt solution.”11 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-460]As would be expected with any long-distance business operation, somecommunications focused on finances. In this case, they demonstrated Tesla’stight resources. “As I have had to pay cash for everything,” wrote Scherff, “thedrain on the funds has been rather heavy,” to the point where he needed anadvance of two hundred dollars from the Chatham Bank in order to meet thatweek’s payroll.12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-461] Some letters dealt with personnelissues, as when Tesla noted that one employee “has turned out very badly and Iam compelled to send him away. . . . [We] were deeply abhorred to discover hischaracter.”13 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-462] A few notes simply kept up on personalnews, as when Scherff asked, “Permit me to inquire about your health. I hopethat you may speedily recover from your cold.”14 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-463]Away from the electrical interference within New York City’s power and telephonysystems that made it difficult to tune sensitive transmitters and receivers,Tesla set out to measure if the earth maintained an inherent electrical charge.If so, he reasoned, inserting a relatively small amount of power, and takingadvantage of resonance, could transmit electricity and messages through theentire planet. Using a device called a coherer, which measures variations inenergy forces, Tesla concluded that the earth was “literally alive withelectrical vibrations.”15 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-464]Colorado Springs, which adopted the nickname “Little London,” also offered Teslarelief from snooping competitors. On the open plain, he built fences and placedsigns around his property, declaring “Great Danger: Keep Out!” and he wrylyinserted a quotation above the laboratory door from Dante’s Inferno, warning:“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.” One enterprising reporter jumped thefence and ignored the signs in order to peer through the lab’s window—only toconfront Tesla’s growling assistant: “Your life is in peril and you would be agreat deal safer if you would remove yourself from the vicinity.”16[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-465]Most mornings, Tesla worked at his office in the laboratory’s southwesterncorner, sending notes to Scherff, answering other correspondence, and preparingpatent applications. The inventor and his on-site assistants, Kolman Czito andFritz Lowenstein, would engage in endless discussions. Lowenstein, atwenty-five-year-old immigrant from Czechoslovakia, spent significant time withthe inventor, eating lunches and dinners together, until September 1899, when,according to a biographer, a jealous Tesla became angry after discoveringletters from his assistant’s fiancée.17 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-466]Experiments would begin about three or four in the afternoon, and when theswitch was thrown, enormous sparks and loud crashes would dance across theinterior. Each evening, Tesla would record his day’s notes, complete withdetailed diagrams and mathematical formulas. (According to Aleksandar Marincic,who several decades later compiled approximately 375 pages of notes, theinventor devoted about 56 percent of his time in Colorado to the transmitter orhigh-frequency generator, about 21 percent to receivers for small signals, 16percent to measuring the capacity of the vertical antenna, and the remaining 6percent to other research.)18 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-467]One young part-time assistant, who swept the lab and ran errands, rememberedTesla as “tall and thin and nervous in manner.” The inventor one day called thislocal lad into the office and asked how much he thought he was worth. Theassistant was “tongue-tied with embarrassment,” which Tesla supposedly watched“in amusement” and then asked if four dollars a week [about one hundred dollarstoday] would be about right. Since this was the young man’s first job, hethought the sum was “princely,” and became overwhelmed when the generous Teslagave him eight dollars.19 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-468] The inventor, however, couldbe very abrupt, as when he called that assistant “a little fool” when he made aminor mistake.The Colorado plateau offered a stark environment and a dry and rarefiedatmosphere. According to Tesla, “The sun’s rays beat the objects with fierceintensity” and caused his tinfoil coatings to shrivel. Yet the “perfect purityof the air, the unequaled beauty of the sky, the imposing sight of a highmountain range, the quiet and restfulness of the place . . . [also] contributedto make the conditions for scientific observations ideal.”20[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-469]The experiments, however, presented dangers. One day when assistant Czito hadwalked into town to pick up supplies, Tesla closed a special switch he haddesigned to handle heavy currents and went behind the coil to examine something.When the switch accidentally opened, “the whole room had filled with streamers,and I had no way of getting out.” He tried breaking a window but could notlocate any tools. With five hundred thousand volts breaking down the air andmaking it hard to breathe, he fell on his stomach and began to crawl.Sixteen-foot streamers sparked above him, yet he finally managed to shut theswitch. Later he would note calmly, “The building [had] begun to burn. I grabbeda fire extinguisher and succeeded in smothering the fire.”21[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-470]Tesla’s experiments, according to one local writer, produced “the convictionthat hell was breaking loose and belching into the building.”22[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-471] After Tesla fired up his equipment, a low rumble builtinto a “roar that was so strong it could be plainly heard ten miles away.” Thebarn regularly emitted a ghostly blue light, sulphurous fumes of ozone filledthe air, and the Tesla coils emitted fiery flashes, some more than a hundredfeet in length.Even the natural environment provided striking—and revealing—lightningdischarges, “sometimes of inconceivable violence.” On one occasion, noted Tesla,“approximately twelve thousand discharges occurred in two hours.”23[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-472] A particularly strong storm broke loose in the earlyevening of July 3, 1899, a day Tesla claimed he would never forget. Thescientist’s sensors recorded the fiery blasts hitting the earth, and after thestorm passed, as expected, the indications became fainter and fainter. Yet thoserecordings soon returned and grew stronger, until they gradually decreased andceased once more. The cycle continued, even though the storm had moved on sometwo hundred miles. To Tesla, this “wonderful phenomenon” proved the planetbehaved like an electrical conductor that reflected the lightning’s disturbancesand created stationary waves.24 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-473] He had worried the earthmight act as a vast reservoir and the electrical waves would slowly dissipate,yet the evening’s observations caused him to conclude the earth is “responsiveto electrical vibrations of definite pitches, just as a tuning fork isresponsive to certain waves of sound.”25 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-474] Tesla suggestedthe resonating electromagnetic charges acted “like an immense pendulum, storingindefinitely the energy of the primary exciting impulses” (i.e., the lightningstrikes), and then he argued: “Not only was it practicable to send telegraphicmessages to any distance without wires, as I recognized long ago, but also toimpress upon the entire globe the faint modulations of the human voice, far morestill, to transmit power, in unlimited amounts, to any terrestrial distance andalmost without loss.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-475] If stationary waves could beprompted by lightning, he reasoned, “it is now certain that they can be producedwith an oscillator.”27 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-476]The July 3 observations prompted Tesla to abandon his initial idea “to erect twoterminal stations, one in London and one in New York,” and to suspend greatdisks from a series of balloons that floated five thousand feet above the earth.He had planned to flash messages from an oscillator atop one of the towers tothe first disk, which then would transmit it thousands of miles through thestrata of rarefied air to the second disk, until the message reached the othertower. Unfortunately, Tesla’s New York workshop initially could not apply enoughvarnish to stop leakages and achieve full inflation of the balloons, with one ofthe craftsmen complaining: “One of them has now twelve coats of varnish, but itis still impossible to fill it up with air. The varnish remains sticky and comesoff in patches.”28 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-477] Even when Tesla finally launchedballoons, they proved to be too heavy, being weighed down by the lengthyelectrical wires attached to the ground station.After abandoning the balloon approach, Tesla turned instead to directing hisartificial lightning into the ground. Taking advantage of his previousobservation of the earth’s natural electrical vibrations, he sensed hisearthbound discharges produced stationary waves—when two ripples of identicalfrequency but traveling in opposite directions interfere with one another. Thatremarkable measurement led him to declare, “Impossible as it seems, this planet,despite its vast extent, behaves like a conductor of limited dimensions,”29[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-478] meaning a low-frequency stationary wave generated by hisoscillator, similar to a lightning strike, could prompt enough resonance to sendmessages and power around the world. Tesla described his observation as “thegreat truth accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed.” This planet, heconcluded, “with all its appalling immensity, is to electric currents virtuallyno more than a small metal ball.”30 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-479]More specifically, Tesla theorized he could reinforce the electrical echo fromhis initial artificial lightning and, as a result of resonance, send it backthrough the earth even more powerfully. He suggested that anyone on the planetcould plug into the ground and draw off some of this energy from the pulsingwaves prompted by Tesla’s oscillators in order to light lamps or run machines.To describe this resonance, while expanding on his “sensitive trigger”observation made during a thunderstorm in Lika, Tesla offered a sports analogy,suggesting his power-thrusting plan was similar to a pump forcing air into anelastic football. “At each alternate stroke the ball would expand and contract,”he explained. “But it is evident that such a ball, if filled with air, would,when suddenly expanded or contracted, vibrate at its own rate. Now if thestrokes of the pump be so timed that they are in harmony with the individualvibrations of the ball, an intense vibration or surging will be obtained.”31[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-480] Similarly, the inventor planned to pump electricalenergy at the right resonance into the earth in order to transmit power andmessages around the world.Tesla, however, needed a stronger pump, or, more accurately, a more powerfulmagnifying transmitter. In his New York lab, his equipment had reached fourmillion volts and produced sixteen-foot discharges, but in Colorado he soughtfifty million volts and hundred-foot-long sparks. The inventor adjusted numerousvariables. He changed the size of the capacitors that fed the primary coil andtried several different coils for the secondary. He tested extra coils placed indifferent places around the transmitter’s circuit. He raised the height of thespherical terminal atop the station’s roof. He increased the voltage coming intothe barn from the Westinghouse transformer. He also tried different tunings foreach of the coils in order to enhance resonance. The result was longer andlonger streamers that jumped ever-expanding gaps between his coils.Tesla’s most dramatic demonstration of his new power occurred on a clear autumnevening when the confident inventor claimed he would obtain “the first decisiveexperimental evidence of a truth of overwhelming importance for the advancementof humanity.”32 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-481] Dressed elegantly in a black PrinceAlbert coat, gloves, and a dark derby hat, Tesla discussed a plan with his braveassistant, Kolman Czito, to explode millions of volts from the top of his mast.Czito would be in charge of the switch, while Tesla went outside to view thecopper dome.Tesla commanded: “When I give you the signal, I want you to close the switch andleave it closed until I give you the signal to open it.” Czito complied and asthe heavy current surged, snakes of flames writhed up the mast. A blue aura,dancing sparks, vicious snaps, and the sharp smell of ozone filled thelaboratory. Although Czito couldn’t see the scientist standing outside, ablissful Tesla stared at the man-made bolts shooting an estimated 135 feet fromthe top of the mast. The inventor had created his own lightning, somethingpreviously reserved for Mother Nature.Suddenly, and with no warning, the roar and blazes ceased. All became dark. Anangry Tesla yelled to Czito: “Why did you do that?” Yet the assistant pointed atthe still closed switch.Tesla then called the El Paso Power Company, screaming: “This is Nikola Tesla.You have cut off my power! You must give me back power immediately! You must notcut off my power!”The town’s distraught power manager yelled back, “You’ve thrown a short circuiton our line with your blankety-blank-blank experiments and wrecked our station.You’ve knocked our generator off the line, and she’s now on fire.”33[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-482]Tesla’s artificial lightning, while it lasted, had produced strange effects onthe planet’s surface. The energized ground around the laboratory, for instance,snapped as he walked across it; he was protected by shoes with six inches ofinsulating cork attached to the soles. Scores of animated butterflies swirledhypnotically in tight circles above the charged earth. Horses with iron shoes innearby fields became agitated and reared up on their hind legs. Independentlightning rods on neighboring buildings flashed when Tesla’s coil discharged,and water faucets emitted sparks. Perhaps most significant, three bulbs placedatop a square of wire sixty feet from the experimental station glowed.Tesla compared the phenomenon of the earth’s conductivity to the echo heard whenthe sound of a voice is reflected off a distant wall. In Colorado Springs, hefelt he reflected an energy wave from within the earth and produced “anelectrical phenomenon known as a ‘stationary’ wave—that is, a wave with fixednodal and ventral regions.” Such waves in the earth, he concluded, would enablean array of wireless effects. According to Tesla, “By their use we may produceat will, from a sending station, an electrical effect in any particular regionof the globe; we may determine the relative position or course of a movingobject, such as a vessel at sea, the distance traversed by the same, or itsspeed; or we may send over the earth a wave of electricity traveling at any ratewe desire, from the pace of a turtle up to lightning speed.”34[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-483]These insights convinced the scientist his wireless system would have fargreater reach than Marconi’s apparatus, which in March 1899 successfully sent amessage across the English Channel from France to England. Although Tesla neverprovided a public demonstration, he boasted to the New York Journal that hewould soon be able to transmit private, wireless communications around theentire world. “You will be able to send a 2,000 word dispatch,” he declared,“from New York to London, Paris, Vienna, Constantinople, Bombay, Singapore,Tokyo, or Manila in less time than it takes now to ring up ‘central.’ ”35[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-484]Tesla later would claim the title of “Father of the Wireless” because his radioefforts had begun eight years before and had achieved “a number of radicalimprovements.” He appreciated early on that his first requirement was to develophigh-frequency generators and electrical oscillators. For the next step, hesaid, “the energy of these had to be transformed into effective transmitters andcollected at a distance in proper receivers.” Tesla, in fact, seems to have beenthe first to propose using transmitting and receiving antennas tuned to the samefrequency. Also needed were systems to ensure each transmission could be keptseparate and free of extraneous interference. The scientist expressed greatpride in his advances and declared boldly: “I gave to the world a wirelesssystem of potentialities far beyond anything before conceived.” He went on tobrag he had “overcome all obstacles which seemed in the beginning unsurmountableand found elegant solutions of all the problems which confronted me.”36[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-485]Tesla argued that no one, including Marconi, could transmit a message anyappreciable distance “without the use of my apparatus.” He claimed five of hisdiscoveries were necessary for such transmission: “First, my method ofoscillatory conversion by means of condensers; second, the so-called ‘Teslatransformer’; third, my apparatus for the transmission of energy without wire,comprising grounded, resonant circuits; fourth, my methods and apparatus forindividualizing signals; and, fifth, my discovery of the stationary waves.”37[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-486]Tesla had filed his basic radio patent application in the United States in 1897,and it was granted three years later. He had proposed a wireless “system oftransmission of electrical energy” that would “transmit intelligible messages togreat distances.”38 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-487] (Tesla submitted other radiopatents, focused on transmissions through the earth, after his Colorado Springsexperiments.) Although Marconi had applied in England in 1896, he did not filein America until November 1900, and he was turned down. The Italian inventorresubmitted his claim over the next three years, consistently arguing he wasunaware of Tesla’s ideas or devices. The U.S. Patent Office kept rejecting thepleas and in 1903 bluntly concluded: “Marconi’s pretended ignorance of thenature of a ‘Tesla oscillator’ being little short of absurd. The term ‘Teslaoscillator’ has become a household word on both continents [Europe and NorthAmerica].”39 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-488] A Marconi associate later admitted theItalian also did not understand the earth’s role in conveying electrical energy;“we knew nothing,” he stated, “about the effect of the length of a wavetransmitted governing the distance over which communication could beaffected.”40 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-489]Still, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company—in part because of the youngItalian’s dramatic demonstrations, his business acumen, and his familyconnections with wealthy English aristocrats—thrived on stock markets, withBritish shares rising quickly from three dollars to twenty-two dollars. In theUnited States, the inventor attracted investments from Andrew Carnegie andengineering advice from Thomas Edison. For reasons never explained, but probablybecause of pressure from such financial and scientific backers, the U.S. PatentOffice retreated from its previous rejections and in 1904 granted a radio patentto Marconi.Tesla tried to remain stoic as the Italian gained more and more attention. Whenan engineer said, “Looks as if Marconi got the jump on you,” Tesla replied,“Marconi is a good fellow. Let him continue. He is using seventeen of mypatents.”41 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-490] In fact, Tesla early in hiswireless-development process graciously met with the Italian scientist toexplain “the function of my transformer for transmission of power to greatdistances.” On other occasions, however, Tesla bluntly asserted his system’ssuperiority and argued, “Mr. Marconi was experimenting with my apparatusunsuccessfully.” He once called the Italian scientist “a donkey.”As Marconi became more famous, it seems he avoided Tesla. When the Italianscientist traveled to New York to raise money and license his own patent, Teslatried to confront Marconi at one of his presentations but wrote: “When helearned that I was present he became sick, postponed the lecture, and up to thepresent time has not delivered it.”42 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-491]Tesla’s system initially offered more privacy and noninterference of messages.When Marconi in 1901 tried to cover the America’s Cup race off New York City,the American Wireless Telephone & Telegraph Company, a rather aggressivecompetitor, sent ten-second transmissions that jammed the Italian scientist’ssignals. Marconi’s radio broadcasts also could be picked up by other receivers,a real drawback for the U.S. military worried about the enemy interceptingmessages. In contrast, Tesla drew on the “individualization” advances he madeduring his robotic boat experiments. He claimed his transmitter “is notprimitively characterized by a single note, or peculiarity . . . but representsa very complex and, therefore, unmistakable individuality, of which the receiveris the exact counterpart, and only as such can it respond.”43[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-492]Even though Tesla enjoyed a reasonable claim to being the first to theorize anddevelop wireless communications equipment, Marconi was winning the publicrelations battle and demonstrating actual transmissions. More and more reportersheard Tesla making promises while Marconi achieved progress. The gossipy TownTopics went so far as to disdainfully describe Tesla as “America’s Own and OnlyNon-Inventing Inventor, the Scientist of the Delmonico Café.”44[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-493]What was happening to Tesla? No doubt he was increasingly isolated. Encamped inColorado, he failed to network with his fellow inventors and trade-journalwriters who became more and more skeptical when his prophesying nevermaterialized. The laboratory fire in March 1895 certainly set back Tesla’sefforts and allowed others, particularly Marconi, to make unchallenged progress,and it also diverted his focus away from realizing his wireless transmissionideal. Tesla’s lectures seemed to suggest he was stuck on displays of artificiallightning, producing brighter snaps and louder crackles rather than practicalapplications.The public skepticism increased after Tesla’s highly sensitive receiver inColorado Springs detected weak oscillations in the form of rhythmic beeps, whichthe scientist suspected came from outer space. “My first observations positivelyterrified me,” wrote Tesla later, calling the sounds “something mysterious, notto say supernatural.” As he thought about the phenomenon, he rejected anypossible solar or terrestrial cause and admitted “the feeling is constantlygrowing on me that I have been the first to hear the greeting of one planet toanother.”45 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-494]Tesla initially kept such observations to himself. Yet when asked by the localRed Cross Society to opine on the “greatest possible achievements of the nexthundred years,” he could not hold in his excitement. “I have observed electricalactions, which have appeared inexplicable,” he gushed. “Faint and uncertainthough they were, they have given me a deep conviction and foreknowledge, thatere long all human beings on this globe, as one, will turn [their] eyes to thefirmament above, with the feelings of love and reverence, thrilled by the gladnews: ‘Brethren! We have a message from another world, unknown and remote. Itreads: one . . . two . . . three.’ ”46 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-495]Although Tesla merely suggested the signals were extraterrestrial, scornfuljournals ridiculed him for having conversations with Martians, and scientistsscoffed. The former director of the University of California’s Lick Observatorycomplained, “Until Mr. Tesla has shown his apparatus to other experimenters andconvinced them as well as himself, it may safely be taken for granted that hissignals do not come from Mars.”47 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-496]Tesla, of course, was not the only scientist who claimed to hear communiquésfrom outer space or the beyond. Marconi almost twenty-five years later said he“had often received strong signals out of the ether which seemed to come fromsome place outside the earth and which might conceivably have proceeded from thestars.”48 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-497] Edison made an even more bizarre claim ofhaving devised a “spirit phone” that could contact the dead.49[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-498] The editor Robert Johnson, trying to protect his friendfrom criticism, concluded that the moral was: “Better to be second than first insome things.”50 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-499]Notwithstanding such diversions and criticisms, Tesla achieved some successesduring his eight months in Colorado Springs. He reached his goal of fiftymillion volts from a magnifying transmitter, an advanced version of the Teslacoil, by carefully tuning and synchronizing his equipment. He created artificiallightning, with thunder heard fifteen miles away in Cripple Creek and streamersstretching 135 feet. After fixing the El Paso Power Company’s dynamo, hemanipulated different-sized streamers flying off the sphere rising above theroof of his barn. Tesla certainly enjoyed the show, commenting that “at night,this antenna, when I turned on to the full current, was illuminated all over andit was a marvelous sight.”51 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-500] More importantly, hedemonstrated the power of high-voltage transmissions, yet he only suggestedtheir potential to transmit electricity and messages.Tesla sometimes complained in Colorado that his “concentration of mind strainedto so dangerous a degree the finest fibers of my brain.”52[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-501] Yet he regularly conveyed his enthusiasm to friends inNew York. “My experiments here have been a source of great pleasure andsatisfaction,” he wrote, “and if I never came here I would never had discoveredfacts which I did.”53 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-502]The most striking results from Colorado Springs proved to be the series ofsixty-eight pictures taken at the experimental station by Dickenson Alley, aphotographer sent from New York by The Century Magazine. Among the more dramaticwere of the lengthy streamers emitted by Tesla’s transmitter. Perhaps the mostmemorable image was of Tesla calmly reading a book in front of a deluge ofsparks; yet this photograph proved little about the inventor’s experiments.Alley had cleverly used a double exposure since it would have been too dangerousfor the scientist to actually sit so close to such an electrical storm. Teslalater admitted, “The streamers were first impressed upon the plate in dark orfeeble light, then the experimenter placed himself on the chair and an exposureto arc light was made and, finally, to bring out the features and other detail,a small flash powder was set off.”54 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-503] Thepublicity-conscious experimenter claimed he didn’t like such trick photography,but he argued, unconvincingly, that “some people find such photographsinteresting.”55 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-504]Tesla also asserted that the high-frequency current he sent into the ground littwo hundred 50-watt incandescent lights in the mountains twenty-six miles fromColorado Springs, but no evidence supports that assertion. An Alley photograph,however, does show three glowing lamps—placed on the ground atop asixty-two-foot square network of wire—that were said to be sixty feet from thetransmitter in the laboratory. (The Prestige, a 2006 movie starring Hugh Jackmanand Christian Bale, exaggerated the Tesla claim with a scene complete with afog-drenched field and soaring music, which showed the inventor walking amidst ahundred lighted bulbs he had screwed into the ground.)Why would Tesla exaggerate? One explanation is that he tried to compensate fornot achieving his one grand ideal—the wireless transmission of power. Twohundred bulbs twenty-six miles away over the Rocky Mountains must have soundedfar more dramatic to this consummate showman than only three bulbs a mere sixtyfeet away. Yet the false claim suggests that Tesla, for perhaps the first time,was willing to go beyond showmanship to embellish the truth.The inventor maintained that the photographs effectively documented his work,saying “nothing could convey a better idea of the tremendous activity of thisapparatus.”56 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-505] Unfortunately, he had no independentwitnesses to his wireless transmission tests, something out of character withhis earlier experimentations.57 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-506] Even Tesla’s chiefassistant admitted during a subsequent patent trial that he had remained in thelab and had never personally seen man-made lightning during the high-frequencyexperiments. That lack of verification prompted critics, as well as investors,to increasingly question the value of the inventor’s wireless transmissionclaims.This dearth of independent verification is odd for a careful scientist likeTesla. Why would he feel that his notes and photographs were sufficient toimpress financiers and other scientists? Was he so ensconced in his own littleworld in Colorado Springs that he simply got sloppy? Was he so addicted to hisown pyrotechnics that he abandoned the practical? It seems Tesla was losing hisrigor, his focus. He was not, however, losing his self-confidence.Tesla expressed complete satisfaction with his Colorado achievements, arguinghis aim had been simply “to perfect the apparatus and make generalobservations.”58 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-507] He had created lightning and pushedpower into the earth. He even believed his large oscillator had set the earth inelectrical resonance, opening up the possibility for people around the world toplace receptors into the ground in order to obtain signals and power. As thetwentieth century arrived, still committed to his one big idea, Tesla wanted tomove on to even higher frequencies and unlimited wireless transmissions."},{"pageContent":"11.

As part of his investment deal with John JacobAstor, who was one of the hotel’s owners, Tesla would live there for the nexttwo decades.Tesla filed three patents that year for wireless communication devices andbragged to the media that “my experiments have been most successful, and I amnow convinced that I shall be able to communicate by means of wirelesstelegraphy not only with Paris during the [upcoming] Exhibition [Universelle of1900], but in a very short time with every city of the world.”1[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-508]A key part of the inventor’s public relations blitz featured his article andDickenson Alley’s photographs from Colorado Springs for The Century Magazine,that well-respected venue edited by his good friend Robert Johnson. Tesla’spiece was to be in the same issue as an article on political reform by TheodoreRoosevelt, then nominated to be vice president. In front of this wide audience,Johnson hoped Tesla would explain the historical importance of his discoveries;instead, the inventor used this platform to pontificate.Tesla’s first draft highlighted lifestyle advice. “Whisky, wine, tea, coffee,tobacco, and other such stimulants are responsible for the shortening of thelives of many, and ought to be used in moderation,” he wrote. “But I do notthink that rigorous measures of suppression of habits followed through manygenerations are commendable. It is wiser to preach moderation than abstinence.”2[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-509] In the same article, however, he admitted that he’dconsumed enough alcoholic beverages to “form a lake of no mean dimensions.”3[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-510]Tesla even offered recommendations about hygiene: “Uncleanliness, which breedsdisease and death, is not only a self-destructive but a highly immoral habit. Inkeeping our bodies free from infection, healthful and pure, we’re expressing ourreverence for the high principle with which they are endowed. He who follows theprecepts of hygiene in this spirit is proving himself, so far, trulyreligious.”4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-511]Why would Tesla offer lifestyle and hygiene advice? In his mind, the suggestionshad something to do with inventing. The Scientific Man, as he envisioned thatideal, needed to be moderate and clean.Of course, that model inventor also had to offer broad thinking, and Teslaproposed later in the article a global system of wireless communications. Hepredicted controlling the weather with electrical energy. He foresaw a world inwhich machines eliminated the need for war.The ever-expanding article became a source of conflict with ­Johnson, whocomplained that Tesla’s ramblings offered more visions than facts. “Trust me inmy knowledge of what the public is eager to hear from you,” the seasoned editorwrote. “Keep your philosophy for a philosophical treatise and give us somethingpractical about the experiments themselves.”5 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-512]Tesla responded testily: “My opinion is that no extraordinary intelligence, suchas possessed by every Century reader, is needed to follow my ideas and torecognize in them a connected whole.” With sarcasm, he asked, “How then does theCentury differ from other magazines?”6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-513]Ignoring Johnson’s advice, Tesla provided thirty-six pages of florid prose andobservations about human progress, including an incomprehensible formula: E =mV2/2—where “E” equaled total human energy, “m” the mass of humanity, and “V”the velocity of human change. He even concluded with a poem entitled “Hope” fromJohann Wolfgang von Goethe: “Lo! These trees, but bare poles seeming, yet willyield both fruit and shelter.”Johnson protested again. “I will do anything but see you write an ineffectivearticle when you have a chance to make so good an impression.” The editoroffered numerous suggestions and complained the writer was “making a task of asimple thing.” He also pressed for quick action: “Give us somethingpractical . . . and do it soon.” He even tried flattering Tesla: “Forgive myclumsy way of saying it because of my love and respect for you and because Ihave had nearly thirty years of judging what the public finds interesting.”7[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-514]Tesla answered with a mix of affection and humor: “I learned with great regretjust now, that you are not feeling well, and I shall cherish the two hopes, thatyou will soon get well and that it is not my article which made you sick.”8[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-515] Tesla demanded keeping the complex formula and Goethepoem in his article, but he tried to appease Johnson by agreeing “that topreserve unity, I must have only three chapters after the first introductorypart. Each of the chapters will thus deal with a specific problem and itssolution, and they ought to be, to preserve balance, of not widely differentlengths. You will recognize the great advantage of this mode of treatment.”9[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-516] Johnson described the modified text to be “a vastimprovement.”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-517]Tesla titled the Century article “The Problem of Increasing Human Energy, withSpecial References to the Harnessing of the Sun’s Energy.” He paid particularattention to energy efficiency, or eliminating waste in the generation and useof electricity; he calculated that we “do not utilize more than two per cent of[coal’s] energy.” The inventor, probably thinking of himself, declared: “The manwho should stop this senseless waste would be a great benefactor of humanity.”Yet Tesla recognized that even burning coal more efficiently would “ultimatelylead to the exhaustion of the store of the material.” Needed, instead, was “toturn to the uses of man more of the sun’s energy.” He estimated thoseinexhaustible or renewable rays “supply energy at a maximum rate of over fourmillion horsepower per square mile.”11 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-518]Although he discussed at length the potential to generate electricity from thesun, wind, and geothermal resources, the scientist came to the conclusion that“the ‘solar engine,’ a few instances excepted, could not be industriallyexploited with success.”12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-519] Yet he offered a grandersustainable-energy proposal, one that would utilize the temperature differencesbetween the earth’s internal heat and the cold of the cosmos. “Imagine athermopile consisting of a number of bars of metal extending from the earth tothe outer space beyond the atmosphere,” he wrote. “The heat from below,conducted upward along these metal bars, would cool the earth . . . and theresult, as is well known, would be an electric current circulating in thesebars.”13 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-520]Near the end of his article, Tesla shared his vision of the inventor’s role—tofocus on long-term fundamental ideals rather than short-term practical results.“The scientific man,” he wrote, “does not aim at an immediate result. He doesnot expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is likethat of a planter—for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation for thosewho are to come, and point the way.”14 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-521]The Century article attracted a lot of attention in the popular press,reflecting Tesla’s growing reputation in both the United States and Europe as ascientific genius. Yet engineering journals tended to be less kind, with onesuggesting “the public should be protected from such wild speculation passingfor scientific fact.”15 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-522]Skepticism was justified. Tesla had been given the opportunity to address a wideaudience, but he couldn’t stay on message, and he focused far more on visionsthan practicalities. One explanation is his self-confidence had grown so muchthat he overestimated his readers’ interest and the power of his ownpontificating. It also could be said that he was losing his filter, with hismind jumping wildly from hygiene to geothermal energy to wireless transmissions.The article, however, hinted at the next phase of Tesla’s life and work. Inflowery terms, he resolved to develop “an efficient apparatus for the productionof powerful electrical oscillations.” Such a “venturesome task,” he declared,involved “great sacrifice,” yet it was “the key to the solution of other mostimportant electrical and, in fact, human problems.”16 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-523]Tesla, in a subsequent interview, argued that the insights he obtained in theRocky Mountains could be realized only if he built a larger and more powerfulsystem. “The plant in Colorado,” he explained, “was merely designed in the samesense as a naval constructor designs first a small model to ascertain all thequantities before he embarks on the construction of a big vessel.”17[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-524]Building something big, however, required big investments. While Astor hadabandoned Tesla as a fickle scientist, he allowed him to remain rent-free in theWaldorf Astoria. Tesla felt his best hope was George Westinghouse, with whom hehad developed a personal relationship and whom he called “my friend,” eventhough he addressed his letters formally to “Dear Mr. Westinghouse.” The twoexchanged regular notes, with Tesla once suggesting a portrait painter with “adeep idea of your personality such as would enable him to make of you a portraitwhich would be a very valuable addition to the art.”18 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-525]Westinghouse was all business. On several occasions, the Pittsburgh manufacturerasked about a “device for commutating alternating into direct current: . . . Iwould like to know if you have advanced far enough with your patents andexperiments to be now in a position to let the Westinghouse ­Electric & Mfg. Co.undertake the manufacture of such apparatus upon reasonable terms.”19[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-526]Tesla wanted to talk about little else than his wireless experiments. Not longafter returning from Colorado Springs, he wrote a three-page “personal” letterto Westinghouse proclaiming that his “success has been even greater than Ianticipated, and . . . I have absolutely demonstrated the practicability of theestablishment of telegraphic communication to any point of the globe by the helpof a machine I have perfected.” Tesla then bemoaned that he hadn’t securedsufficient funding beforehand and inadvertently revealed his lack of businessskills: “I have been so enthused over the results achieved and have worked withsuch a passion, that I have neglected to ask such provisions for money, as wouldhave been dictated by prudence.” He concluded by admitting, “I make no secrecyof needing the money.”20 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-527]The different motivations of Tesla and Westinghouse were on display after acourt ruled in their favor on a patent lawsuit regarding ­Tesla’salternating-current motor. Westinghouse argued Tesla sought recognition while hewanted profits: “The courts have awarded to you the credit for a greatinvention; and because we are likely to have our rights respected [theWestinghouse company] may reap some of the advantages due to the largeexpenditures we have made in the commercial development of your inventions.”21[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-528]Still, Westinghouse didn’t see the business potential in Tesla’s latest wirelessresearch and refused to support him, although his company did offer a loan onthe condition the scientist used Westinghouse equipment. Tesla kept pleading, tolittle avail. “Has anything happened to mar the cordiality of our relations?” heasked earnestly. He ardently argued that wireless transmissions would “very sooncreate an industrial revolution such as the world has never seen before.” Withthat would come the possibility for great profits, and he appealed toWestinghouse’s instincts as an inventor: “This far advanced work [is] now in thedelicate stage of a sprout. It is easy to destroy and difficult to succeed.”22[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-529]Tesla could have made money by working with the United States Lighthouse Board,which wanted the scientist in spring 1899 “to establish a system of wirelesstelegraphy upon the Light-Vessel No. 66, ­Nantucket Shoals, Mass., which liesoff about 60 miles south of Nantucket Island.”23 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-530] Thegovernment “preferred to award home talent”—meaning Tesla over Marconi—but theproud American citizen disliked being compared in any way to the Italianscientist and claimed he “would never accept a preference on any ground.”24[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-531] Such stubbornness meant Tesla missed the chance todevelop wireless communication on someone else’s dime. According to onehistorian, the inventor’s refusal became “one of the most significant blundersof his career,” since the project would have brought in needed funds as well asoffered high-profile publicity for ­Tesla’s sophisticated long-distance wirelesstelegraphy.25 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-532]Thinking on a grander, if less practical, scale, Tesla proposed a “world system”of wireless communications. He envisioned sending telephone messages, music,stock market reports, pictures, and even secure military messages to any part ofthe planet. The man even foresaw the Internet access that did not becomeavailable, at least in the form of the World Wide Web, until 1990 and that wenow take for granted. “When wireless is fully applied,” Tesla predicted, “theearth will be converted into a huge brain, capable of response in every one ofits parts.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-533]With that vision, Tesla eventually obtained a loan of $150,000 (equivalent toabout $4.3 million today) from J. P. Morgan. Wall Street’s most powerfulfinancier was in the midst of forming a billion-dollar steel industry trust, andthe amount he loaned Tesla was equal to what he’d paid for a single painting,The Duchess of Devonshire by Thomas Gainsborough. In supporting Tesla’s devotionto wireless research, Morgan could have been trying to protect his investmentsin existing telegraph, telephone, and electricity businesses, including theGeneral Electric Company. Or he could have been trying to gain control of anyfuture wireless industry. He also could have simply wanted a way to signal hissteamships at sea or to obtain up-to-date quotes from the New York StockExchange when he traveled in Europe. Perhaps Morgan considered the contribution“philanthropic,” as Tesla hinted in a letter,27 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-534] similarto his charitable support for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other artistsand intellectuals.Whatever the motivation, Morgan cut a hard bargain, shamelessly adding demandsto obtain control of Tesla’s previous lighting patents. The scientist complainedmodestly to one of Morgan’s assistants, writing: “I need scarcely say that Iwould sign any document approved by Mr. Morgan, but believe that there exists amisunderstanding in regards to my system of lighting which was not in theoriginal proposition.”28 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-535]As when Tesla tore up his royalty contract with George ­Westinghouse, here theinventor again does the irrational—giving away control of key and unrelatedpatents. Was he simply a poor negotiator? Because he was low on money, the Astorfunds having run out, was he vulnerable to being tricked by a business superman?Was he doubting his own abilities and worrying he had no other options? Did hesimply abhor the world of finance and want to get back to inventing? Somecombination of such charges offers a perspective on Nikola Tesla in the earlytwentieth century.Morgan usually ended up controlling the conglomerates he created, a processsometimes referred to as “Morganization.” The investor, said Tesla, towered“above all the Wall Street people like Samson over the Philistines.”29[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-536] The man was imposing, standing a stocky six feet twoinches tall with broad shoulders and piercing eyes. He suffered from a rare skindisease that caused his nose to grow huge and glow purple (the vain bankeravoided pictures and required portraits be touched up), yet he flaunted his DonJuan conquests. The arrogant and feared banker cared little for his employees,competitors, the public, or even the inventors he bankrolled.Tesla had little choice but to express appreciation for the “great man’s” loan.“How can I begin to thank you in the name of my profession and my own, greatgenerous man!” he wrote gushingly after signing the financing agreement. “Mywork will proclaim loudly your name to the world. You will soon see that notonly am I capable of appreciating deeply the nobility of your action, but alsoof making your primarily philanthropic investment worth a hundred times the sumyou have put at my disposal in such a magnanimous and princely way!”30[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-537]Tesla also tried to endear himself to the Morgan family. Louisa, J.P.’sdaughter, invited the scientist to her wedding in the autumn of 1900, an eventalso attended by John Jacob Astor and Theodore Roosevelt. Anne, J.P.’s youngerdaughter, took a fancy to Tesla at that party and invited him to the grandThanksgiving dinner at the Morgan mansion on Madison Avenue, where Tesladelighted the gathered with displays of streamers, wands of light, and variouswireless robots.Another fundraising success occurred in August 1901 when Tesla received fromJames S. Warden, a lawyer and real estate investor, a low-cost mortgage for atwo-hundred-acre parcel of wooded and isolated land on the north shore of LongIsland. Warden had purchased 1,600 acres of farmland in Suffolk County,sixty-five miles from New York City along the recent extension of the LongIsland Railroad’s Northern Branch, where he hoped to entice New Yorkers to buildsummer retreats. The plot, mostly surrounded by potato farms, was just a fewmiles from a charming beach at the hamlet of Wading River on Long Island Soundand not far from the town of Southampton on the Atlantic Ocean side. Wardenchristened the development “Wardenclyffe” (although the village’s name changedin 1906 to “Shoreham”). No doubt the developer admired Tesla’s brilliance but healso bet that the scientist’s new project might attract other businesses andemploy hundreds, if not thousands, of workers who would need new homes nearby.Tesla convinced Stanford White—the famed and flamboyant architect he had met atThe Players, the historic private social club facing New York’s Gramercy Park—todesign an imposing laboratory, a ninety-six-foot-square, one-story, red-brickbuilding with a center chimney topped with a cast-iron wellhead. A principal inthe influential design firm of McKim, Mead, and White, the architect, describedin social columns as “the dashing man with the red moustache,” had won praisefor his work on the Washington Square Arch (1889), the second Madison SquareGarden (1890), the Vanderbilt family residence (1905), the New York HeraldBuilding (1894), as well as the “cathedral of power” at Niagara Falls. Duringthe design and construction of the Wardenclyffe laboratory, White and Teslabecame good friends, enjoying long walks together through Long Island’s woods.White would drive up from his Long Island estate in his fashionable electrictwo-seater runabout, and Tesla sometimes would spend nights at the Whitecompound, where, according to White’s son, Tesla “used to wander around at nightin the garden in the moonlight; and when my mother asked him why he wasn’tasleep, he replied: ‘I never sleep.’ ”31 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-538] It was an oddcombination—an inventor who abhorred physical contact and an architect whosponsored “Girl-in-the-Pie Banquets” that featured topless young women.Tesla bet big on Wardenclyffe. The laboratory and tower culminated his drivetoward wireless transmissions, his one big idea.White initially estimated the project’s construction expenses at fourteenthousand dollars, but they continued to rise, in part because the stock marketpanic of 1901 pushed up the cost of building materials. Oblivious to suchincreases, Tesla demanded enhancements, including handsome woodwork and a widebalcony. The structure, he said, was to be “divided into four compartments, withan office and a machine shop and two very large areas.” In one of those largeareas sat two 300-horsepower boilers. In the opposite room, there were “fivelarge tanks, four of which contained special transformers created so as totransform the energy for the plant.”32 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-539] Tesla alsoinstalled a control unit that could “give every imaginable regulation that Iwanted in my measurements and control of energy,”33 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-540] andhe arranged for the Long Island Railroad to build a spur that could deliverequipment and coal.The scientist spared little expense personally as well. During the lab’sconstruction, he commuted by train daily from the Waldorf Astoria toWardenclyffe, accompanied by a man servant carrying a heavy hamper with lunchprepared by the fancy hotel’s chefs. The hour-and-a-half trip aboard a luxurytrain car—past Manhasset, Oyster Bay (where Vice President Theodore Rooseveltlived), and Smithtown (where Stanford White had his family estate)—gave Tesla achance to review mail and articles. When the Wardenclyffe facility becameoperational, he rented a lavish cottage on the shore of Long Island Sound.Tesla, moreover, spent heavily on laboratory equipment and personnel. Heemployed nearly twenty highly skilled workmen, as well as armed guards toprevent competitors from spying.Tesla in the early years of the twentieth century showed every sign ofsuccess—with an apartment at the Waldorf, funding from the greatest financier,and designs from the foremost architect. Despite hints of trouble associatedwith the lack of verifications for his Colorado Springs experiments and hisramblings in the pages of The Century, most reporters and fellow scientistspredicted more and more achievements—particularly because the brilliantinventor, with an impressive track record, was putting all of his energies intoa single spectacular idea.The tower at Wardenclyffe, Tesla argued, would have to be massive in order tosuccessfully transmit signals and power through the earth. Wanting to uselow-frequency long waves, he initially calculated the assembly should rise sixhundred feet, about twice the height of the iconic Flatiron Building that openednear Madison Square in 1903 (and more than three times taller than many oftoday’s cell phone towers). Noting that a sphere stored more electrical chargethan other profiles, he called for topping the tower with a molded set ofhemispheres. However, the ever-rising costs were now estimated by White at fourhundred fifty thousand dollars—more than thirty times his original estimate.Tesla reluctantly accepted redesigns and settled on a 187-foot-tall tower toppedwith a simple dome, 68 feet in diameter.The escalation of Wardenclyffe’s costs from fourteen thousand dollars to fourhundred fifty thousand dollars is an apt metaphor for Tesla’s grandiosity,deserved or not. It demonstrates both his total commitment to this wirelessideal as well as his lack of business sense or even of moderation when it cameto money. This brilliant man—born between one day and the next, between thepresent and the future—usually had a foot in both this world and the world onlyenvisioned. Yet at Wardenclyffe, Tesla veered untethered toward the future. Withlittle anchor to reality, let alone anyone to check his impulses, the inventorlost his way.Although smaller than Tesla had hoped, the cupola still weighed fifty-five tonsand could act like a sail in the strong winds from Long Island Sound and theentire tower might topple. To obtain the needed support, White designed aningenious eight-sided structure that tapered as it rose. To ensure it didn’ttransmit electric shocks, Tesla ordered unfinished pine timbers rather thanconductive iron or steel girders. For the system to transmit power through theground, the inventor declared that the tower had “to have a grip on the earth sothat the whole of this globe can quiver.”34 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-541] To gain sucha grip, Tesla sank a shaft below the water table, constructed a 120-foot spiralstaircase around it, and then drilled sixteen iron pipes an additional 300 feetinto hard rock. The site’s designs also called for a series of four tunnelsrising to the surface from the bottom of the well, yet their actual location andpurpose remain a mystery. Local villagers observed the enigmatic excavation was“as deep as the tower is high, with walls of masonwork and . . . that Teslaspends as much time in the underground passages as he does on the tower or inthe handsome laboratory.”35 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-542]Even though the inventor had trimmed Wardenclyffe’s size, it was audacious inNovember 1901 to begin construction of such an expensive project when hisfinances were so uncertain. It also suggested imprudence when Tesla’s chiefsupporter, a tycoon capable of making and breaking corporations, let alonedreamy inventors, showed displeasure in Tesla’s idealism. Maybe theever-confident scientist believed his tower would indeed launch a worldcommunications enterprise. Maybe he remembered how his previous inventions hadprovided riches for Morgan and other financiers (if not for himself directly).Maybe his myopic focus on this one grand idea of wireless transmissions wassimply foolhardy.Undaunted, Tesla simply maintained that this “grip of the earth” would allow hismagnifying transmitter to send an electrical wave through the earth and have itbounce back. Building on the theory of resonance, he assumed he could transmitanother charge that would be in phase with the original, thus creating astationary wave. With the earth humming at this electromagnetic resonantfrequency and with his tower offering a return for the circuit, the scientistbelieved anyone could connect a receiver into the ground and obtaintransmissions of messages and power. Expressing total confidence in his design,he assured Morgan the Wardenclyffe project would produce “electrical effects ofvirtually unlimited power, not obtainable in any other ways heretofore known.”36[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-543] Tesla even began making plans for a series of similartowers around the world, the second to be placed outside Glasgow, Scotland.Yet Tesla faced growing competition from Marconi, who by early 1900 was sendingmessages up to 185 miles and who was building large circular antennas inCornwall in England and St. John’s in Newfoundland in order to transmit radiowaves across the Atlantic Ocean. The tenacious Marconi pressed on aftergale-force winds destroyed both initial towers. On December 12, 1901, during alull in another hailstorm, the Italian inventor and his colleagues in St. John’sreceived a Morse code message for the letter “S” that had been sent fromCornwall. Even with no independent witnesses, Marconi announced the achievementtwo days later to international acclaim; the New York Times pronounced thismovement of messages through the air, without wires, “the most wonderfulscientific development of recent times.”37 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-544]An embittered Tesla argued Marconi’s demonstration was predicated on his ownoscillators, coils, and designs. The Italian scientist, in contrast, arguedTesla’s equipment was ineffectual and unnecessary. Their arguments would ragefor years and only accelerated after ­Marconi received the Nobel Prize inPhysics in 1909.Building on the laudatory press reports, Thomas Commerford ­Martin organized acelebratory banquet with three hundred scientific luminaries at the Waldorf’sAstor Gallery, and he decorated the hall with a large map of the Atlantic Ocean,placed model transmission towers at each table, and draped an Italian flagaround Marconi’s portrait on the dais. Michael Pupin offered a qualifiedendorsement, saying “If I did not know him personally, I would not believe him,because the proof which Signor Marconi has furnished is not sufficiently strongfrom a purely scientific point of view.” The Columbia University professor usedthe occasion to take a swipe at his fellow Serb, suggesting Tesla simply claimedhe could transmit “wireless signals by the wobbling of the change of the earth”but never offered “an engineering specification of [his] apparatus.”38[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-545]Despite the event being at his own residence, Tesla sent his regrets and apolite note: “I wish to join the members in heartily congratulating Mr. Marconion his brilliant results. He is a splendid worker, full of rare and subtleenergies. May he prove to be one of those whose powers increase and whose mindfeelers reach out farther with advancing years for the good of the world andhonor of his country.”39 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-546] Yet Tesla proved to be lesstactful when the New York Times subsequently asked for comment. Suggesting hisown innovative equipment and pioneering theories of wireless telegraphypredicated Marconi’s accomplishment, the inventor moaned that the Italian hadsent only a tiny message while bragging that he, Tesla, soon would reveal a moresophisticated and useful system.The newspaper also requested a statement from Thomas ­Commerford Martin, editorof Electrical World, who praised Marconi and bluntly dismissed Tesla. “I amsorry,” he said, “that Mr. Tesla, who has given the matter so much thought andexperimentation, and to whose initiative so much of the work is due, should notalso have been able to accomplish this wonderful feat.”40[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-547] Martin, however, went out of his way later to mend hisrelationship with Tesla, writing in a personal note: “I know of no changewhatever in my sentiments towards you these many years from the beginning untilnow. I shall always be very proud of my modest association with your earlierwork.”41 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-548] Relations improved a bit more in 1903 whenMartin sent to Tesla a book he dedicated to the scientist, prompting Tesla toreply: “Many thanks for the book. It was a pleasure to read the dedication whichtells me that your heart is true to Nikola.”42 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-549]While Marconi amassed more and more acclaim, Tesla merely amassed more debt. Heapproached Morgan for a larger loan, but the financier refused and even delayedby two months making his final payment on the initial agreement. Tesla persistedwith more letters regaling the wonders of his “World Telegraphy System” and its“tremendous money-making power.”43 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-550] His plan called forWardenclyffe-like towers near “large centers of civilization” that “as fast asthey receive the news, they pour them into the ground, through which they spreadinstantly.”44 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-551]Tesla even described a handheld, inexpensive receiver that would allow someoneto listen to anything virtually anywhere.45 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-552] Well beforethe age of mass production, not to mention some seventy years before theintroduction of cell phones, he proposed manufacturing millions of thesedevices.The inventor defended his leadership on wireless transmissions, arguing that“all the essential elements of the [Marconi] arrangements . . . are broadlyanticipated by my patents of 1896 and 1897.”46 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-553] He thendished out more idealism. “I have never attempted, Mr. Morgan, to tell you evena hundredth of what can be readily accomplished by the use of certain principlesI have discovered,” he wrote. “If you will imagine that I have found the stoneof the philosophers you will be not far from the truth. They will cause arevolution so great that almost all values and all human relations will beprofoundly modified.” The ever pragmatic Morgan, however, wanted to hear aboutfinancial returns rather than revolutionary visions.47 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-554]Tesla resorted again to flattery and pleading. “Now, Mr. Morgan, am I backed bythe greatest financier of all times?” he asked. “And shall I lose great triumphsand an immense fortune because I need a sum of money?48 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-555]He then begged: “Are you going to leave me in a hole?!! I have made a thousandpowerful enemies on your account, because I have told them that I value one ofyour shoe-strings more than all of them.”49 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-556] He alsoadded a little nationalism: “Is it not due to the honor of this country that itbe identified with this achievement? Have I not contributed to its greatness andprestige and have my inventions not exercised a revolutionary effect upon itsindustries? These are not my claims, Mr. Morgan, only my credentials.”50[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-557]Tesla later attempted more bravado. “I hope you will never for a moment confoundmy art with the incompetent efforts of my imitators. I could do better than anyof them, if ninety-nine parts of me were paralyzed.”51 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-558]He also dismissed the profit potential of Marconi’s efforts, suggesting “therewas no money” in reporting yacht races or signaling incoming steamers. “This wasno business for a man in your position and importance,” he told Morgan.52[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-559]The persistent (and somewhat pathetic) scientist then issued threats. “What adreadful thing,” he wrote, “it would be to have the papers come with your namein red letters—A MORGAN DEAL DEFAULTS. It would be telegraphed all over theglobe.”53 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-560] Tesla candidly admitted to Morgan:“Financially, I am in a dreadful fix.”54 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-561]The inventor knew on some level that his pleas were ineffective. He admittedwriting often “in moments of despondence with the pain [was] too hard tobear.”55 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-562] This once disciplined thinker, however,couldn’t stop himself.Hearing nothing, a frantic Tesla decided to go public, writing asix-thousand-word treatise for Electrical World & Engineer about the value ofhis ideas, hoping the financier would suddenly realize the potential and changehis mind. The effort probably had the opposite effect, in part because the wayhe expressed his vision—that “the entire earth will be converted in a hugebrain”—seemed outlandish and impractical. And the less-than-tactful Tesla endedhis essay with a public jab at Morgan’s judgment: “Perhaps it is better in thispresent world of ours that a revolutionary idea or invention instead of beinghelped and patted, be hampered and ill-treated in its adolescence . . . byselfish interest, pedantry, stupidity and ignorance; that it be attacked andstifled; that it pass through bitter trials and tribulations, through theheartless strife of commercial existence.”56 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-563]When he still heard nothing, Tesla lashed out and criticized the “Great Man,”declaring, “You are no Christian at all, you are a fanatic musoulman [Muslim].Once you say no, come what may, it is no.”57 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-564]Morgan finally replied, in his own handwriting, “I regret to say that I shouldnot be willing to advance any further amounts of money as I have already toldyou. Of course I wish you every success in your undertakings.”58[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-565]Tesla continued pleading, insensitive to Morgan’s logical observation thatTesla’s wireless dream was more costly and less practical than Marconi’sachievement. “You fire me like an office boy,” Tesla complained, “and roar sothat you are heard six blocks away; not a cent. It is spread all over town, I amdiscredited, the laughing stock of my enemies.”59 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-566]Several months later, Morgan’s assistant firmly responded: “Dear Sir, Referringto your letter of the 13th October, Mr. J. P. Morgan wishes me to inform youthat it will be impossible for him to do anything more in the matter.”60[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-567]During this period, Tesla tried to secure backing from numerous other financialand business magnets, including Henry Clay Frick (an industrialist who alsolived in the Waldorf), H. O. Havemeyer (of American Sugar Refining Company),Jacob Schiff (a Wall Street banker), Oliver Payne (a colleague of J. D.Rockefeller), and John Sanford Barnes (president of the St. Paul and PacificRailroad). They all rejected Tesla’s proposal, often asking why Morgan wasn’tinvesting more. Potential investors found Tesla’s proposals to be “vague andnebulous.” For instance, after Tesla’s pitch to the Independent Lamp and WireCompany, a vice president noted the inventor “had no concrete ideas, much lesspractical data, which would indicate the direction of the research he wanted toconduct.”61 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-568]Despite his complicated and strained history with General Electric, Tesla evenmade a presentation to its president, Charles Coffin, and later wrote: “If [theGE people] refuse they are simply snoozers.” Nothing came of that meeting.62[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-569] Thomas Fortune Ryan (an insurance and tobacco magnate)initially agreed to provide some financing, but it appears Morgan talked him outof it. Tesla then repetitioned George Westinghouse, who claimed to have becomeonly the titular head of his company without access to investment funds.Part of Tesla’s problem was Morgan controlled 51 percent of his patent rights onany wireless transmission system. Since the financier would obtain adisproportionate share of any future profits, new investors anticipated littleincentive.Tesla also reached out to his family, including his previously supportive unclesas well as his two surviving sisters—Milka and Marica—each of whom had married apriest, which would suggest they had few resources to share. Since Tesla hadsent funds to relatives when he was financially flush, he felt it appropriate toask for some when stretched. The largest contribution, several thousand dollars,came from Nikola Trobojevic, Tesla’s nephew who engineered a steering gear forwhich he obtained a royalty contract with General Motors. Yet when Trobojevicstopped the contributions after he lost his GM deal and his wife became ill,Tesla responded bitterly, “When I was in most dire straits you did not help. Icannot forget that you denigrated my integrity.”63 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-570]A desperate Tesla continued to press J. P. Morgan: “You let me struggle on,weakened by shrewd enemies, disheartened by doubting friends, financiallyexhausted, trying to overcome obstacles which you yourself have piled up beforeme. Will you let a property of immense value be depreciated, let it be said thatyour own judgement was defective, simply because you once said no?”64[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-571]In a lengthy and lucid thirteen-page letter, Tesla described the history of hispatents and plans. He admitted altering his initial agreement with Morgan tomanufacture oscillators and cold lightbulbs. He claimed his switch towardwireless transmissions was necessary because the “audacious schemer” Marconi hadpirated his radio patents and because he envisioned an opportunity to transmitfar more than Morse-coded messages. Tesla acknowledged other financiers avoidedhim after he’d lost support from Morgan, who was understandably “skeptical ofgetting hundred-fold returns.” He ended with a weak plea: “If you will help meto the end, you will soon see that my judgment is true.”65[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-572]The financier himself replied “no” once again, declaring Tesla’s trials were ofhis own making. “I am not willing to advance you any more money as I havefrequently told you,” Morgan wrote. “I have made and carried out with you ingood faith a contract and having performed my part, it is not unreasonable thatI expect you to carry out yours.”66 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-573]Stoking an image of Tesla as a visionary and benevolent genius oppressed byentrenched interests, some historians have suggested Morgan blocked furtherinvestments for fear the inventor would devise systems that threatened thefinancier’s stake in General Electric as well as in copper mines that suppliedthe wire for transmitting electricity. One such someone-said-to-someone-elsesuggestion came from Andrija Puharich, an inventor and physician who knewTesla’s friend and first biographer, John (Jack) O’Neill. According to Puharich,O’Neill “said that Bernard Baruch [a successful stock investor] told J.P.Morgan, ‘Look, this guy is going crazy. What he is doing is, he wants to givefree electrical power to everybody and we can’t put meters on that. We are justgoing to go broke supporting this guy.’ And suddenly, overnight, Tesla’s supportwas cut off, the work was never finished.”67 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-574]If this account is accurate, Tesla should not have been surprised by such areaction from Morgan, having several years before revealed the economicallydisruptive nature of his inventions. Bragging his wireless system would providecheap electrical energy throughout the world, he declared that “all monopolies”that depend on wires to distribute power—including utilities, electricalequipment manufacturers, and copper mine owners—“will come to a sudden end.”68[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-575]Another explanation, as Morgan himself wrote, is that Tesla had not deliveredand the financier was unwilling to waste more money. It had been two and a halfyears since Tesla promised to span the Atlantic, and it instead was Marconi whodelivered on that promise. The financier mostly wanted a practical means tosignal ocean liners and send Morse code to Europe, whereas Tesla keptenvisioning a worldwide web of communications and power.Morgan also had more important things brewing, from merging firms intoInternational Mercantile Marine and International ­Harvester to defendinghimself against President Theodore Roosevelt’s antitrust investigation of hisNorthern Securities Company. Perhaps more importantly, the stock market fall of1903, referred to as the “Rich Man’s Panic,” disrupted financing for virtuallyall projects. Four years later, the Bankers’ Panic of 1907 further promptedshares on the New York Stock Exchange to plummet, sparking another round ofinvestment cutbacks.Still, Tesla issued yet another missive, labeling Morgan as “the biggest WallStreet monster” who had broken their contract for what he labeled “the greatestinvention of all times.” He described the financier as “a big man, but your workis wrought in passing form, [while] mine is immortal.” Egotistical and frantic,Tesla boasted: “I have more creations named after me than any man that has gonebefore not excepting ­Archimedes and Galileo—the giants of invention. Sixthousand million dollars are invested in enterprises based on my discoveries inthe United States today.”69 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-576]Tesla childishly cranked up the power at Wardenclyffe, heaving streamers intothe sky and prompting neighbors, according to a newspaper, to fret about “allsorts of lightning . . . from the tall tower. Until after midnight the air wasfilled with blinding streaks of electricity that seemed to shoot off into thedarkness on some mysterious errand.”70 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-577] People inConnecticut, some twenty miles across the Long Island Sound, witnessed theartificial lightning and the cupola glow an eerie blue.(In the 1930s, when Tesla was in his seventies and growing senile, he seems tohave forgotten his frustrations with Morgan, bragging to his secretary that he“could get money from him just by asking for it.” Supposedly, Tesla casuallywalked into the mighty banker’s office and “Mr. Morgan asked if he could writeout a check for me and called for the boy to bring his book. Morgan signed ablank check and asked me to fill in the amount I needed.”)71[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-578]Finances weighed heavily on Tesla. “The obstacles in my way,” he wrote to hisassistant, “are a regular hydra. Just as soon as I chop off a head, two new onesgrow.”72 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-579] In June 1904, the Colorado Springs powercompany won a $180 judgment that allowed them to tear down Tesla’s lab and sellthe lumber.73 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-580] To make matters worse, after seventeenyears Tesla’s fundamental poly-phase patents expired in May 1905, reducing asource of royalties and payments from various manufacturers that had utilizedhis inventions.Despite his financial woes, Tesla continued to live rather regally at theWaldorf Astoria. He shifted his regular dinners from Delmonico’s to the hotel’sgrand Palm Room, where guests ate beneath an ornate three-storied dome of amberglass, from which hung a sculpted chandelier. The lavish dining room was filledwith large palms and decorated in the Italian style and finished in terracottaand Pavonazzo marble. In order to be seen and keep up appearances, thewell-dressed Tesla entered the restaurant each evening after walking through theglamorous, three-hundred-foot-long marble corridor that was nicknamed PeacockAlley. His table, at which he would dine regularly for eighteen years, stoodnear the wall and was set only for one.The less-than-pragmatic inventor turned down a few lucrative contracts,including a request by Lloyd’s of London to use his wireless system to report onan international yacht race. The inventor asserted he could not be bothered byminor projects.“I confess my low commercial interests dominate me,” he moaned to his friendRobert Johnson, whose home he continued to periodically visit for dinners andconversation. Tesla signed the letter “Nikola Busted.”74 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-581]He expressed humiliation in going from door to door “to solicit funds from someJew or promoter.” Frustrated and with few options, he cried, “I am tired ofspeaking to pusillanimous people who become scared when I ask them to invest$5,000 and get the diarrhea when I call for ten.”75 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-582](This was not Tesla’s only anti-Semitic comment. His secretary remembered theinventor complaining about Fritz Lowenstein, a former assistant, making a profitfrom Tesla’s radio inventions. According to Dorothy Skerritt, Tesla “drew closeand whispered, as he always did when he had something important to say,‘Miss—Never trust a Jew!—Never trust a Jew!’ ”76 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-583] Apriest, moreover, recalled the inventor saying, “I am born idealist, notmaterialist; there is no Jewish blood in me.”77 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-584] Incontext, such comments were not uncommon among contemporary business andengineering leaders, and it doesn’t appear Tesla discriminated against anyonebased on religion. He later would rail against Hitler, although his criticism offascists was limited to their treatment of Serbs.)Claims on his limited money seemed limitless. James Warden demanded back taxeson the Long Island land, the phone company threatened to cut off service, andthe Westinghouse Company wanted some thirty thousand dollars for its equipmentat the laboratory. Since Tesla had failed to pay his bills and taxes, theColorado Springs sheriff put his remaining electrical equipment there up forsale; an electrical transformer went “for about $10, or one-tenth of its marketvalue.”78 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-585] To a friend Tesla declared, “I SWEAR if I everget out of this hole, nobody will catch me without cash!”79[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-586] Colleagues were becoming worried about his outlook.George Scherff, after one of the scientist’s visits to Wardenclyffe, remarked:“I have scarcely ever seen you so out of sorts as last Sunday and I wasfrightened.”80 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-587]The only thing that cheered Tesla up was a visit from Richmond Hobson, the warhero and naval engineer. In a letter to another acquaintance, Hobson revealed,“I went to see dear Tesla. He kissed me on the cheek, as once before, and when Ileft him at one o’clock last night, I felt he was prepared and ready for anotheryear and for future years.”81 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-588]About a year and a half later, in spring 1905, Hobson startled Tesla with newsof his plan to marry Grizelda Houston Hull, from a well-connected Kentuckyfamily. Hobson’s letter revealed the close relationship between the engineer andthe inventor. “Do you know, my dear Tesla,” he wrote, “you are the very firstperson, outside of my family that I thought of . . . I wish to feel you presentin standing close to me on this occasion so full of incoming in my life. Indeed,I could not feel the occasion complete without you. You occupy one of thedeepest [places] in my heart.”82 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-589]Tesla, a self-described celibate, tried to talk Hobson out of marrying. “Yourcareer will be over once you marry,” he argued—to no avail.83[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-590] With some prodding, Tesla served as an usher in thewedding at the Hobson home in Tuxedo Park, New York. Yet it took several years,according to Grizelda Hobson, for Tesla to finally become “reconciled to hisdear friend ‘Hobson’ getting married.”84 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-591](Hobson became a rear admiral in the U.S. Navy as well as a Democratic member ofthe U.S. House of Representatives from Alabama during the years 1907 to 1915. Heand Tesla remained close for years, often going to dinner or the cinema.According to Grizelda, “These two dear friends, about once a month or sometimesoftener, would meet and go to a movie and then sit in a Park, and talk tillafter midnight! Richmond always came home with enthusiasm over some newinvention of Tesla’s and well I recall the night he told Richmond, ‘I can shakethe world out of its orbit, but I won’t do it, Hobson!’ ” When Hobson was buriedin Arlington Cemetery in March 1937, Tesla sent a “gorgeous flowering azalea” toMrs. Hobson at her New York apartment.)85 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-592]By the fall of 1905, a stressed Tesla suffered “abused nerves (that) finallyrebelled and I suffered a complete collapse.”86 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-593] Hestruggled for months with ominous dreams, particularly about the deaths of hisbrother and mother, finding those visions, he later wrote, “almost unbearableand every night my pillows were wet from tears.”87 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-594] Thefrustrated scientist lashed out bitterly at the “blind, fainthearted, doubtingworld.”88 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-595]Nothing seemed to be going well for Tesla. In June 1906, his friend andcolleague, Stanford White, was shot three times and killed at ­Madison SquareGarden by the jealous husband of a former chorus girl, Evelyn Nesbit, who wasWhite’s mistress. Perhaps fittingly, noting White’s numerous dalliances, themillionaire husband, Henry Thaw, aimed his pearl-handled pistol between the eyesof White, whom he called “the Beast,” while the entertainer at the Roof TopGarden sang “I Could Love a Thousand Girls.” The scandal kept most colleaguesand acquaintances from the funeral, but Tesla arose from his sickbed to attend.Tesla had lost several key figures in his life, most notably Anthony Szigeti in1890 and his mother in 1892, but the death of White, with whom he shared dinnersat The Players and leisurely walks on Long Island, distressed the inventorduring a rocky period and accelerated his sense of isolation. “I’m ever in somuch trouble,” he confessed in erratic penmanship to his friend KatharineJohnson.89 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-596] He blocked all sunlight from entering hishotel room. He refused to eat. Electrotherapy to his brain became his onlytreatment. “I have passed [150,000 volt]) through my head and did not loseconsciousness,” he wrote, “but I invariably fell into a lethargic sleep sometimeafter.”90 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-597] Sadly, his ongoing trials prompted Tesla toabandon some of his ambitions and to temper his drive. “The practical lesson ofall this,” he wrote, is “to beware of concentration and be content with mediocreachievement.”91 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-598]"},{"pageContent":"12. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch12]TOO MUCH OF A POET AND VISIONARY [06_Contents.xhtml#ch12]New York CityTesla slowly recovered his strength but not his Wardenclyffe project. Debtsmounted, the Port Jefferson Bank demanded loan repayments, and workers trickledaway or sued him for back wages. On a foggy morning, the Westinghouse Company,bolstered by a court order, sent horse-drawn wagons to collect its equipment.Tesla described that day as the saddest of his life. A newspaper referred to theLong Island venture as “Tesla’s million-dollar folly.”In April 1912, when John Jacob Astor died aboard the Titanic, Tesla lost anotherkey contact. Although Astor had stopped supporting ­Tesla’s research yearsbefore, he’d allowed the scientist to live rent-free in the Waldorf Astoria. By1915, Tesla was forced to sign the Long Island property’s deed over to theWaldorf Astoria Company, whose new proprietor had demanded three years of rent.The hoteliers failed to convert the Wardenclyffe property into a touristattraction, and the War Department rejected a plan to use the tower forreconnaissance against enemy submarines. Some unverified news reports suggestedGerman spies deployed the structure to communicate with their ships off the U.S.coast. By July 1917, a salvage company dynamited the tower—multiple timesbecause of its sturdy construction—and sold the scrap for only $1,750.Bringing down the tower also brought down Tesla’s dream of delivering wirelesscommunications and power to the world. Bitter and frustrated, he blamed“small-minded and jealous individuals” who “are to me nothing more than microbesof a nasty disease.” Despite overreaching on the science and under-reaching onfunding, he was right to declare, “The world was not prepared for it. It was toofar ahead of time, but (it) will prevail in the end and make it a triumphalsuccess.”1 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-599]The financial stress led to a change in Tesla’s tone, expressing a more frequentwillingness to belittle and boast. He started calling his competitors “feeblemen,” including Professor Ferraris, even though, as noted earlier, he hadadmitted “Tesla developed [an AC poly-phase system] much further than [I] did.”2[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-600] Tesla increasingly discounted Edison and Marconi aspioneers, particularly compared to himself: “I had to cut the path myself, andmy hands are still sore.” His references to his own work became more and morevain, as when he insisted his system to send power wirelessly through thisplanet “is so perfect now that it admits of but little improvement. . . . Wouldyou mind telling a reason why this advance should not stand worthily beside thegreat discoveries of Copernicus?”3 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-601]No doubt Tesla had reasons to be bitter. He had invented the induction motor,the poly-phase system for transmitting alternating current, remote control,robots, wireless communications, and the “individualization” of messages. Whilea slew of businessmen using his insights had made millions, he lamented nothaving received his due in credit or compensation. In a letter to the New YorkWorld, he complained: “Had the Edison companies not finally adopted my inventionthey would have been wiped out of existence, and yet not the slightestacknowledgment of my labors has ever been made by any of them, a remarkableinstance of the proverbial unfairness and ingratitude of corporations.”4[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-602] Tesla also lashed out at the Westinghouse Company forallegedly pirating his wireless patents for its radio machinery. “You haverobbed me of the credit that is due and injured me seriously in business,” hewrote to the firm’s vice president. “Instead of showing a willingness to adjustthe matter in an equitable way, you say you want to fight.”5[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-603] The embittered inventor was becoming increasinglyisolated.Adding to that loneliness was the death of George Westinghouse in March 1914 inNew York City at the age of sixty-seven. (Tesla then was almost fifty-eight.) Asa Civil War veteran, Westinghouse was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.Despite Tesla’s periodic complaints against the company, George Westinghouse hadperhaps been his most stalwart supporter. The firm had for many years beeneasing out its founder and that process culminated with the financial panic of1907 when financiers forced Westinghouse’s resignation. Before his ouster,George had remained an active inventor, developing steam turbines, shockabsorbers for automobiles, and heat pumps that provided both heating andcooling.Despite being financially strapped, more and more alone, and mentally unstable,Tesla, even in his late fifties and early sixties, kept his looks and agilebuild. His weight did not vary by even a single pound for almost thirty-fiveyears, and his suits continued to fit him “like a glove.” When the inventor wasfifty-nine, one reporter observed: “Where he keeps his years, no one knows. Theyare not in his face, for his face looks like forty. They are not in his hair,for his hair is black. If they are anywhere, they are in his eyes, for his eyesare sad.”6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-604] To demonstrate his strength and agility,Tesla recalled, probably with a good bit of exaggeration, walking back to hisNew York hotel on a cold, slippery night. When he lost his balance and his legswent out from under him, there was, he said, “a flash in my brain, the nervesresponded, the muscles contracted, I swung 180 degrees and landed on my hands.”Brushing himself off, he resumed his march. A man walking behind him marveled atTesla’s feat. “ ‘How old are you?’ he asked critically. When told fifty-nine,according to Tesla, the man observed, ‘I have seen a cat do this, but never aman.’ ”7 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-605]Without a major donor, Tesla finally was forced to take on varied projects, suchas working with Budd Manufacturing of Philadelphia on a petrol-powered turbine;in Detroit, he helped Ford, General Motors, and other automakers design a flyingcar. He spent nine months in ­Chicago trying to develop headlights for railroadengines. In contrast to his early claims of perfecting devices in his mind, henow admitted, “As we advance we recognize the crudity of our first conceptions.New problems presented themselves which had to be solved and they were so hardthat they consumed about all the energy I could command.”8[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-606] Such projects allowed him to hire an assistant or two,but the funds were never enough to restart another Wardenclyffe.More problematic, scientists began to realize Tesla was wrong about the earth’sability to transmit messages and power. Nikola had assumed electrical powerwould flow through the planet and be available to receivers atop it. Comparingthe earth to a balloon (and sometimes to a metal ball), he believed the globe’sinterior would act like water, or any incompressible fluid, where waves flowback and forth with little loss of power. Yet the earth’s interior behaves morelike a giant ocean, with energy waves dissipating and eventually disappearing.Put another way, although Tesla never acknowledged it, the earth proved to be aninefficient conductor of electricity or messages.Another fundamental error was Tesla’s belief that power and telegraphicengineering needed complete circuits. Focusing on the electrostatic thrusts fromhis oscillator, he largely dismissed the electromagnetic theory advanced byJames Clerk Maxwell in 1865, proved by Heinrich Hertz in the late 1880s, andpromoted in the 1890s by so-called Maxwellians—including Oliver Lodge, JohnPerry, and George Francis FitzGerald. We now know that these waves ofelectromagnetic field—including visible light, gamma radiation, and radiowaves—radiate through space and don’t require electricity’s return circuit.Being wrong periodically, of course, is a natural part of inventing. ThomasEdison, for instance, spent substantial sums and time trying to improve theiron-ore milling process, but his technological developments proved to beunprofitable. The Wizard of Menlo Park, however, carried on, commenting on hisfinancial losses: “It’s all gone, but we had a hell of a good time spendingit.”9 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-607]Tesla tried to carry on as well. He reluctantly acknowledged the criticism fromthose he called “my enemies” that he was too much of “a poet and visionary”rather than the producer of “something commercial,”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-608]yet in his heart, he most enjoyed imagining the ideal. Age was tempering theprecision of his mind, yet he also had tilted his balance toward tomorrow andvisions. His thoughts progressively became viewed as prophetic or delusional,depending on the viewer’s perspective. Some criticized him as a scientifichuckster, but there’s no doubt he continued to think deeply and broadly about arange of challenges and opportunities.Foreseeing the Internet and even the smart watch, for instance, he predicted in1908 “it will be possible for a business man in New York to dictateinstructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London orelsewhere. . . . An inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, will enableits bearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land, music or song, the speech of apolitical leader, the address of an eminent man of science, or the sermon of aneloquent clergyman, delivered in some other place, however distant. In the samemanner, any picture, character, drawing, or print can be transferred from one toanother place.”11 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-609]Tesla got many things right; however, he also made predictions that proved to beembarrassing. In 1908, five years after the Wright brothers’ demonstration inNorth Carolina but nineteen years before Charles Lindbergh’s transatlanticflight, he proclaimed that the “aeroplane is altogether too heavy to soar.” Thebetter alternative, he reasoned, was the dirigible balloon being developed byCount Zeppelin that was “safe and reliable, [able] to carry a dozen men andprovisions, and with a speed far in excess of those obtained with aeroplanes.”12[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-610] Yet even with this miscalculation, Tesla offered theinsight that “the propeller is doomed” at high velocities and would be replacedby “a reactive jet.”13 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-611]While Tesla prophesized, other inventors produced. Lee de Forest, for instance,boosted the speed of Morse-code transmissions to six hundred words per minute,and he signed a contract with Bell Telephone to build a “radio wireless” systembetween New York and Philadelphia. (De Forest as a young man had asked Tesla fora job, but the inventor turned him down, predicting he needed his independencein order to achieve great things. De Forest went on to develop the three-element“Audion” vacuum tube that enabled radio broadcasting and became the basis forelectronics, but he maintained throughout his life that Tesla had been hisgreatest inspiration.)Perhaps Tesla’s most ingenious product during this challenging period was abladeless turbine that was to create a more efficient electrical system and morepowerful airplane engines. Rather than rely on the complex rotating blades orbuckets used in conventional turbines, which resembled windmills withinchambers, Tesla designed a machine that would press fluid, steam, or air througha series of carefully racked disks, and as the fluids or gases spiraled down,they dragged and rotated a shaft with them. In reverse, the fluid or gas wouldspiral out from the center and act as a pump.Tesla, returning to a theme underlying many of his inventions, claimed his goalfor the turbine was “simplicity itself.” The machine, he declared, would have“no exciter, no commutator, brush or sliding contact whatever, no centrifugalregulator, voltage controller or any such complicated and hazardous devices.” By“its adaptability to high temperatures far beyond those practicable in bucketturbines,” Tesla’s device promised significantly higher efficiencies. Theinnovative turbine, moreover, would “adjust itself instantaneously to pressurechanges . . . without the slightest observable change in the intensity of thelight.”14 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-612]From 1911 to 1918, he devised several such turbines—ranging in size from onehundred to five thousand horsepower—at the Waterside Power Station of the NewYork Edison Company. Their key advantage proved to be the ability to produce farmore horsepower per pound of weight, making them lighter and smaller, yet morepowerful, than bladed turbines. “I have an engine that will give ten horse powerto a pound of weight,” the inventor explained. “This is twenty-five times aspowerful as the lightest weight engines in use today.”15 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-613]The engine, moreover, could be small and portable, what he called “a powerhousein a hat.”16 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-614]Tesla again demonstrated his unique perspective on nature. While most engineerswanted to limit the “skin friction” that put a drag on boats and vehicles, theinventor sought to make use of this force, what he called “viscous shear.” Heunderstood that gases and liquids can be sticky substances. If you pour water ona smooth surface, for instance, most will roll off but some will stick and causeresistance. By “transforming that old hindrance into a new help,” one journalistobserved, “Tesla’s turbine balances a wheel in a current of steam or gas in sucha manner that it is caused to rotate, not by the push but by the pull of thesteam.”17 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-615]For at least a moment, Tesla could again bend nature to his will. He creativelyenvisioned harnessing negative forces to his advantage. Unfortunately, hecouldn’t turn this ideal into something practical.This scientist who’d been known as a master showman failed to devise aconvincing demonstration. Instead, his tug of war between two linked turbinesproduced loud straining but no motion. Unimpressed audiences declared the testto be unsuccessful.On the business front, the independent inventor could not locate a manufacturerwilling to accept the risks associated with producing a novel machine. The majorproducers of turbines, Westinghouse Manufacturing and General Electric Company,were not interested in a design that might compete with their bladed turbines.“I have been striving . . . to have a strong and well equipped manufacturingestablishment putting on the market improvements as I may make them,” Teslawrote in May 1918. When he targeted a small manufacturer, the inventor noted“they have extraordinarily efficient personnel—mostly young and aggressive menand the factory is large, quite modern, and up to date.”18[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-616] Yet he soon realized the industrialist had interestsother than his turbine, and he disappointingly concluded they were “awfully busypeople, hustlers who are away most of the time.”19 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-617]On the technical front, the shaft’s high speeds put significant stress on thethin disks, often causing them to warp. Steel alloys strong enough to withstandthe strain had not yet been developed. According to one engineer several yearslater, “Tesla was about twenty-five to thirty years ahead of his time.Metallurgy was not what it is today. Magnetic bearings are a whole new science.He didn’t have the right materials.”20 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-618]Tesla, once again, proved to be his own worst enemy. When he finally discoveredinterest from the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company of Milwaukee, he demandedto work only with the firm’s president, ignoring the engineers who had to buildand test the device. When those piqued workers pushed for several modifications,Tesla simply walked away and haughtily declared, “They would not build theturbines as I wished.”The bladeless turbine would have been considered a significant advancement ifmodern metallurgy had been available in the early twentieth century. Still, thedevice, with its process reversed, operated efficiently as a pump, and Teslasold a license to the Alabama Consolidated Coal & Iron Company. Withrediscovered optimism and humor, Tesla ordered from a friend at the WestinghouseCompany a million induction motors to drive his new turbines, though he jokinglyadmitted, “But as I have learned to go slow, I shall take only one at first.”21[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-619]Tesla also suggested the basic concepts for what became known as radar. In orderto detect enemy aircraft and ships, he proposed in August 1917 to “shoot out aconcentrated ray comprising a stream of minute electric charges vibratingelectrically at tremendous frequency, say millions of cycles per second, andthen intercept this ray, after it has been reflected by a submarine hull forexample, and cause this intercepted ray to illuminate a fluorescent screen onthe same or another ship, then our problem of locating the hidden submarine willhave been solved.”22 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-620] Seventeen years later, when Teslawas still alive, Dr. Emile Girardeau and his French team built and installedradar on ships and land stations, using, he said, “precisely apparatusesconceived according to the principles stated by Tesla.”23[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-621] Girardeau added that Tesla may have been “prophesying ordreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but onemust add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly.”24[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-622]Another prophetic idea was for a small but powerful winged aircraft that couldrise like a helicopter straight into the air and then proceed straight like anairplane. With a wingspan of eight feet, the five-hundred-pound vehicle would bepowered by a turbine engine and be capable of carrying two people. The pilotcould tilt the propeller “through manipulation of the elevator devices,”25[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-623] and his seat would swivel to remain upright as the wingsmoved into horizontal positions. The aircraft would land by reversing theseprocesses. Tesla’s vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) proposal, for which heobtained a patent in 1928 (which would be his last filing, at the age ofseventy-two), was the first known design for a VTOL. Although no one was willingto finance its production, Tesla’s plan became several decades later the basisfor aircraft manufactured by aerospace giants for the United States Navy andMarines.Tesla missed out on practical opportunities to develop his robots ortelautomatons, largely because of his stubbornness and egocentricities. Thewealthy Hammond family, which had given ten thousand dollars to Tesla in 1898for the advancement of selective tuning devices, wanted to form theTesla-Hammond Wireless Development Company, as Jack Hammond explained, in orderto “perfect an automatic selective system, to perfect the [submersible] torpedo,and eventually to carry out your magnificent projects that will wirelesslyelectrify the world.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-624] Hammond maintained the scientisthad filed a “prophetic genius patent” in 1903 that allowed for combinations offrequencies to send specific directions to machines or lights. Thesignal-sending devices, analogous to modern television scramblers, ensuredprivacy as well as allowed for a virtually unlimited number of signals.Jack Hammond should have been a perfect match for Tesla. He began his owninventing at a New Jersey prep school at the age of sixteen, when he designed areverse switch that turned off his light when the headmaster opened his own doorto check on curfew violators. While an engineering student at Yale University,he became interested in remote control and found Tesla and Bell to be “myscientific godfathers.” Hammond would accumulate more than eight hundred patentsfrom the United States and other countries, became known as the “father of radiocontrol,” and laid the foundation for modern missile guidance systems.27[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-625]Hammond, moreover, admired Tesla as a true inventor and claimed his approachcould neither be duplicated by regimented research nor by the simple expenditureof millions of dollars. “It takes a profound personal dedication for a man toachieve high inspiration,” Hammond concluded, “and this Nikola Tesla had.”28[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-626]Tesla, however, feared Hammond was stealing his telautomatics ideas. After anewspaper reported that Hammond was demonstrating remote-controlled torpedoes tothe military, Tesla sent a bad-tempered note: “I think that you are playing awireless possum. Notwithstanding your assurances, I will watch your progress andbring a friendly suit for infringement as soon as I ascertain that you are infunds.”29 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-627]Hammond subsequently praised Tesla for having, a decade earlier, questioned thepower of Hertzian waves and demonstrating “that waves propagated at atransmitting station travelled along the ground as a conductor.” Yet Teslafretted that Hammond gave too much credit to his archrival Marconi fordeveloping “a complete and practical system of space telegraphy.”30[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-628] Hammond’s wealthy father, meanwhile, didn’t trust Tesla,sensing he “tends to spend gold as if it were copper.”31 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-629]Still, the Hammonds offered Tesla substantial additional investments, but theypleaded for the telautomaton or robot to be evaluated independently. Jack’sbrother wrote to the inventor: “As you know, we have advanced a great manythousands of dollars in the development of this [device] and have expected eachweek the past year to be in a position to have tested it.” Tesla essentiallyignored the appeals, still far more interested in wireless power transmission,despite the technical problems associated with it. The Hammonds persisted,highlighting the “splendid opportunity of having it thoroughly and honestlytested by people who would be the greatest benefit to us should these tests besuccessful.”32 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-630] Tesla, wanting more funds without anyprogress reports, haughtily responded, “The sacrifices which I have beencompelled to make and the losses which I have suffered are such that if I weredealing with a man less attractive to me than yourself, I would disdain toanswer.”33 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-631]So once again, despite his financial struggles, Tesla walked away fromsubstantial backing, as well as from the chance to actually develop his wirelesssystem, in part because he couldn’t work well with others and largely because heremained tunnel-focused on rebuilding his doomed tower. The Hammonds, as goodbusinessmen, got their revenge by submitting their own wireless patents justafter Tesla’s ran out. They made millions and Tesla once more failed to profitfrom his invention.The inventor’s arrogance was becoming a noticed trait. A respected journalistwho interviewed Tesla for Scientific American said the inventor had turned intoa “temperamental genius.”34 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-632] A business colleaguecomplained, “I have had contact with people who found him so difficult to dealwith and so inconsistent and unreliable in his business relations andengagement.”35 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-633]Tesla continued to respond to the growing criticism by arguing he simply wasahead of his time. “Perhaps I was a little premature [with the wireless deliveryof electricity],” he told a group of reporters. “We can get along without it aslong as my poly-phase system continues to meet our needs. Just as soon as theneed arises, however, I have the system ready to be used with completesuccess.”36 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-634] Despite facing fundamental problems, Teslapersistently maintained that the wireless transmission of power was “thegreatest invention of all time.”37 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-635]Tesla’s confidence in his abilities, in fact, rarely flagged. With each newidea, he wrote something like: It “cannot help but prove a colossal success.”Finding financing, however, remained both a challenge and a fantasy. “The onlytrouble is where and when to get the cash,” he often said, “but it cannot lastvery long before my money will come in a torrent.”38 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-636]With little revenue and dwindling energy, Tesla in 1928 closed his office,retired his longtime secretaries, Dorothy Skerritt and Muriel Arbus, and sentthirty trunks of correspondence, papers, and models to the basement of the HotelPennsylvania (where they remained until moved again in 1934 to the ManhattanStorage Warehouse located at Seventh Avenue and 52nd Street).The sorting of Tesla’s financial woes fell to George Scherff, the manager whoseexpanding responsibilities included accountant, advisor, and fundraiser. Most oftheir daily exchanges involved business information, with Scherff forwardingnotes similar to: “If you will kindly send me the information regarding royaltyearned by the Nikola Tesla ­Company . . . I can prepare the tax report and willthen call on you to have the same executed.”39 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-637]Yet Scherff had also loaned money to Tesla (some biographers suggest fortythousand dollars, but that’s equal to almost one million dollars today, whichseems impossibly high for an accountant/office manager), and his repaymentrequests became increasingly anxious. Although Tesla’s secretary once said theinventor “seemed to have Mr. Scherff hypnotized,”40 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-638]Scherff pleaded: “I have bought a house in the country and am somewhat infinancial difficulty. If you could let me have a small payment on account, itwould aid me very much at this time.”41 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-639] In another note,Scherff said his creditors “are hounding me hard, and anything that you can dofor me will be very much appreciated.”42 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-640] When Scherffcomplained that the scientist had forwarded a check for Mrs. Schwartz, a minorinvestor, rather than for him, Tesla scoffed, “I am sorry to note you are losingyour equanimity and poise. Mrs. Schwartz is weak, and you are fully able tofight your own battles. You must pull yourself together and banish the evilspirits.”43 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-641]Most of the time, however, Tesla blithely responded to Scherff’s pleas with histrademark optimism: “I have great prospects which I expect to materialize duringthe next two or three weeks. As soon as they do I shall communicate with you andyou may rest assured that I shall do all in my power to meet the situation.”44[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-642]Scherff needed more than Tesla’s hopefulness. “It is impossible for me to existwithout a steady income,” he finally wrote. “In view of your statement made weekbefore last, that you might perhaps suspend operations here, I am very sorry toinform you that I am compelled to seek other employment.”45[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-643] Still, the two remained close, with Tesla writingletters of recommendation and Scherff continuing to complete the scientist’sfinancial reports while working full-time for the Union Sulphur Company.In fact, Scherff was one of the few colleagues to maintain contact as Tesla agedand his mental health declined. The inventor’s penmanship became more and moresloppy and cross-outs began filling his letters; nonetheless, the accountanttried to cheer up his former boss with regular messages: “I hope sincerely thatyour trials will soon have an end and that in the coming year you will see yourlabors rewarded.”46 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-644]Tesla increasingly failed to keep up with—or accept—advances made by modernscientists, including Albert Einstein, who was more than two decades youngerthan Tesla. Tesla wrongly argued cosmic rays and radio waves could move fasterthan light. He claimed to have “split atoms but no energy was released,” and hedeclared “the idea of atomic energy is illusionary.”47 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-645]Rejecting the premise of Einstein’s E = mc2 formula, Tesla asserted, “The ideathat mass is converted into energy is rank nonsense.”48 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-646]He also repeatedly scoffed at Einstein’s ­theory of relativity, declaring, “I amabsolutely ignoring every one of the tenets of the relativity theory, which tome is just a mass of error. . . . The relativity theory wraps all these errorsand fallacies and clothes them in a magnificent mathematical garb, whichfascinates, dazzles, and blinds people to the underlying errors. The relativitytheory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom the ignorant take for a king.”49[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-647] ­(Einstein, despite such critiques, used Tesla’sseventy-fifth birthday celebration to pay tribute to the inventor as “asuccessful pioneer in the field of high frequency currents.”)50[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-648]Tesla maintained a nineteenth-century view of physics, rejecting the role ofelectrons and believing electrical energy moved through an “ether” thatpermeates space. While Einstein declared “the ether cannot be detected” and wasnot needed to explain how light travels through space, Tesla never abandoned hisbelief in the medium and maintained space cannot be curved because “somethingcannot act upon nothing.”51 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-649]It is odd that this man who was born and lived his life partially in the futurerefused to consider, let alone embrace, new visions of nature. Although he keptforeseeing modern developments, the aging Tesla became less and less willing toview the world from new angles.Tesla’s reality became his lack of money, particularly when World War I stoppedhis royalty payments from European manufacturers. New York City in 1916 sued himfor $935 in back taxes. After admitting under oath that he was penniless andliving on credit, Tesla had the ­following exchange with Justice Finch:“How do you live?” asked the court.“Mostly on credit,” replied Tesla. “I have a bill at the Waldorf that I have notpaid in several years.”“Are there other judgments against you?”“Scores of them.”“Does anybody owe you any money?”“No, sir.”“Have you any jewelry?”“No, sir; jewelry I abhor.”“Any automobiles?”“No, sir.”“Any horses?”“No, sir.”52 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-650]Finding Tesla “possessed no real estate or stocks and that his belongings, alltold, were negligible,” the judge ordered a receiver to manage the scientist’saffairs. Perhaps more embarrassing to Tesla was the fact that the New York Timesand several other journals reported the news. The proud inventor tried to keepup appearances, but according to one account, “this event would mark the turningpoint in his life. Now he began the slow but steady turning away fromsociety.”53 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-651]The New York City lawsuit prompted others. Although resulting in few actualfinancial losses for Tesla, they diverted his attention and accelerated hisanxiety. If he could have found humor in his stressful state, he might havelaughed at a Mrs. Tierstein who was confined to an asylum and sued him for“throwing electricity at her.”54 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-652]During this period, Robert Johnson’s finances also declined—largely because TheCentury Magazine faced increased competition—to the point he asked Tesla formoney, claiming, “I am holding on to my house by the skin of my teeth anddesperately in need of cash.”55 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-653] Tesla tried to cheer uphis friend, writing: “Do not worry about finances. Remember while you sleep Iwork and am solving your problems.”56 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-654] A few days later,the inventor expanded: “Please take my words seriously and do not worry andwrite your splendid poetry in perfect serenity. I will do away with alldifficulties which confront you.”57 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-655] Yet Tesla couldn’thide his own difficulties, to which Johnson, when he finally realized the depthof his friend’s plight, responded, “I did not know how tenuous things are withyou. Do not think me unfeeling, and I shall let my own troubles go hang, ratherthan write you again on the subject. We can sympathize with each other atleast.”58 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-656] It’s telling that Tesla’s best friend was apoet who also had few money-management skills.To obtain a little cash, Tesla prepared a detailed prospectus, printed on vellumpaper and adorned with a red-wax seal and his initials, advertising his“professional services in the general capacity of consulting electrician andengineer.” He also took on odd jobs, including a controversial effort to improvestudent performance by releasing high-frequency charges into classrooms. Workingwith the superintendent of New York City’s public schools, he deployed his coilin a pilot project to excite a group of “fifty mentally defectiveschoolchildren,” hoping the pervasive energy would increase their aptitude testscores and introduce “a new era of education.”59 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-657] Hetried a similar approach at Broadway theaters, creating highly charged dressingrooms in order to stimulate performers before they went on stage."},{"pageContent":"13. [06_Contents.xhtml#ch13]SO FAR AHEAD OF HIS TIME [06_Contents.xhtml#ch13]New York CityDespite his age and financial problems, Tesla attracted more and more publicity.The New York Times in early November 1915 mistakenly suggested Tesla and Edisonwould share the Nobel Prize in Physics. Although he had heard nothing directlyfrom the Nobel Committee, Tesla declared “the honor has been conferred upon mein acknowledgment of a discovery announced a short time ago which concerns thetransmission of electrical energy without wires. This discovery means thatelectrical effects of unlimited intensity and power can be produced, so that notonly can energy be transmitted for all practical purposes to any terrestrialdistance, but even effects of cosmic magnitude may be created.”1[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-658] Edison, in contrast, wisely avoided making anystatement.When it became clear the newspaper report was false, Tesla claimed he would haverefused the award since he wouldn’t share it with Edison and couldn’t accept aprize already given to Marconi. Hearing such, the Nobel Committee went out ofits way to declare: “Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prizebecause he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous.”2[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-659] A few weeks later, the panel formally announced thephysics award for 1915 would go to Sir William Henry Bragg and his son WilliamLawrence Bragg for their use of X-rays to analyze the structure of crystals.Despite their genius and accomplishments, neither Edison nor Tesla would ever berecognized by the Nobel Committee.Tesla was not gracious upon hearing of the panel’s decision. To a New York Timesreporter, he mockingly complained, “A man [Sir Bragg] puts in a kind of gap[into my coil]—and he gets a Nobel Prize for doing it. . . . I cannot stop it.”3[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-660] In a letter to a friend, he boasted, “In a thousandyears, there will be many recipients of the Nobel Prize, but I have not lessthan four dozen of my creations identified with my name in the technicalliterature. These are honors real and permanent, which are bestowed, not by afew who are apt to err, but by the whole world which seldom makes a mistake andfor any of those I would give all the Nobel Prizes which will be distributedduring the next thousand years.”4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-661]The following year Tesla, then aged sixty-one, received an actual award, theEdison Medal from the American Institute of Electrical Engineering. With sometestiness, he initially rejected the honor because it was named after hissometimes nemesis and because the AIEE had for so long ignored his achievements.“It is nearly thirty years since I announced my rotating magnetic field andalternating-current system before the Institute,” he wrote to Bernard A.Behrend, the distinguished Westinghouse engineer who was pushing Tesla to acceptthe AIEE’s highest accolade. “I do not need its honors and someone else may findit useful.”5 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-662] The persistent Behrend, however, eventuallyconvinced Tesla to attend the white-tie ceremony at the Engineers’ Club and thesubsequent tribute across the alley at the United Engineering Societies. Behrendalso needed to convince a few of the AIEE engineers to attend since, accordingto one member, “The stories of Tesla’s sexual episodes were at one time the talkof the Institute, and we didn’t know how to deal with it if the matter shouldsomehow become publicized.”6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-663] (No other members backed upthat claim, and sexual exploits seem unlikely for a germophobe unwilling totouch anyone.)A large crowd gathered on the night of May 18, 1917, including appreciativescientists and his dear friends Robert and Katharine Johnson, MargueriteMerrington (his frequent dining companion), and Edward Dean Adams (his earlyfinancial backer). Tesla appeared at the initial gala to be alert, engaged,straight-backed, and well-dressed. Yet somewhere on the way to the presentationevent across the alley, the guest of honor disappeared. Waiters checkedrestrooms. Assistants investigated nearby buildings.Eventually, on a hunch, Behrend decided to look in nearby Bryant Park, in whichhe remembered Tesla frequently took walks. There, in the shadows, stood thedapper and famous scientist—covered in pigeons. Birds fed from his outstretchedarms. They sat on his head. They swarmed across his black evening pumps. Behrendquietly and carefully removed the creatures, and the two men walked slowly backto the United Engineering Societies building on 39th Street.As if nothing had happened, Behrend offered his formal, though delayed,testimonial. “So far reaching is his work that it has become the warp and woofof industry,” he said of Tesla. “His name marks an epoch in the advance ofelectrical science. From that work has sprung a revolution.” ParaphrasingAlexander Pope’s line about Sir Isaac Newton, Behrend concluded: “Nature andnature’s laws lay hid by night. God said, ‘Let Tesla be and all was light.’ ”7[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-664]When Tesla rose, he offered gracious comments about other inventors,particularly Edison, whom he called “this wonderful man, who had had notheoretical training at all, no advantages, who did all himself, getting greatresults by virtue of his industry and application.”8 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-665] Hehumbly suggested other speakers had “greatly magnified my modest achievements,”and expressed his determination to “continue developing my plans and undertakenew endeavors.” Reflecting on his own life, he rambled a good bit and declared:“I have managed to maintain an undisturbed peace of mind, to make myself proofagainst adversity. . . . I have fame and untold wealth, more than this, andyet—how many articles have been written in which I was declared to be animpractical unsuccessful man, and how many poor, struggling writers have calledme a visionary? Such is the folly and shortsightedness of the world!”9[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-666]How much did Tesla believe of what he said? One minute he was communing withpigeons as his own award ceremony took place and the next he was telling thosegathered that he had “fame and untold wealth.”Tesla then spoke at length about his inventing process. He initially contrastedthis “new method” to Edison’s consistent “improving and reconstructing” until“your force of concentration diminishes and you lose sight of the greatunderlying principle.” Instead, Tesla did “not rush into constructive work. WhenI get an idea, I start right away to build it up in my mind. I change thestructure. I make improvements. I experiment. I run the device in mymind. . . . In this way, you see, I can rapidly develop and perfect aninvention, without touching anything. When I have gone so far that I have putinto the device every possible improvement I can think of, that I can see nofault anywhere, I then construct this final product of my brain.”10[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-667]Tesla also used the occasion to reflect on mortality. “I come from a very wiryand long-lived race,” he said. “Some of my ancestors have been centenarians, andone of them lived 129 years. I am determined to keep up the record and pleasemyself with prospects of great promise. Then again, nature has given me a vividimagination.”11 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-668] (Vivid indeed, since there’s no evidencea relative of his lived 129 years.)Tesla promised to continue battling the “darker side of life, the trials andtribulations of existence,” by trying to maintain “an undisturbed peace ofmind . . . and to achieve contentment and happiness.”12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-669]And he kept inventing. In 1918, he licensed the world’s first air-frictionspeedometer to the Waltham Watch Company, which installed those devices inluxury cars such as the Cadillac, Rolls-Royce, and Pierce-Arrow; acknowledgingthe aging inventor’s continued popular appeal, Waltham mentioned Tesla’s name inits advertisements.13 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-670] The scientist also devised othermeters to measure frequencies and flows, and he developed an innovative processfor refining metals that he sold to American Smelting and Refining Company, acopper-mining giant. Inventing inspired Tesla, even during tough financialtimes. In the first segment of his serialized autobiography, published in 1919in the Electrical Experimenter, he boasted, “I have already had more than myfull measure of this exquisite enjoyment, so much that for many years, my lifewas little short of continuous rapture.”14 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-671] While mostworkers suffered an idle boredom or faced rigid and repetitive tasks, Tesla“thrived on my thoughts.” The only downside of being a prolific inventor, hesaid, was that “so many ideas go chasing through his brain that he can onlyseize a few of them as they fly, and of these he can only find the time andstrength to bring a few to perfection. And it happens many times that anotherinventor who has conceived the same ideas anticipates him in carrying out one ofthem. Ah, I tell you, that makes a fellow’s heart ache.”15[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-672]Some friends were becoming impatient with Tesla’s aching heart. Hugo Gernsback,editor of Electrical Experimenter, had helped Tesla serialize his memoirs andprovided needed attention and funds during this tough period, yet when Gernsbacksuggested featuring Tesla in a new futuristic magazine, the increasinglyirritable scientist complained the monetary reward was too small: “I appreciatedyour unusual intelligence and enterprise, but the trouble with you seems to bethat you are thinking only of H. Gernsback first of all, once more, and thenagain.”16 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-673] When Gernsback, who also published sciencefiction, asked Tesla to write an article on earth conduction, the inventorhuffed: “Your statement that an article from me would be worth to your paper$100 might be flattering if my friend . . . had not offered me $2500 for twohundred words. On this occasion, I painfully remember that my contributions tothe Electrical Experimenter cost me a few thousand dollars.”17[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-674]Tesla’s touchiness resulted in part from the consistent need to protect hisinventions through the legal system. Believing his were the first patents andarticles explaining the concepts for radio communications, he filed patentinfringement lawsuits against Marconi in August 1915. Telefunken, the Germantelephone company, also sued Marconi, and the following year, the MarconiWireless Telegraph Company of America responded by charging the U.S. governmentfor its alleged unauthorized use of wireless during World War I. That chargeprompted Franklin Roosevelt, then acting secretary of the Navy, to suggest thegovernment’s case against Marconi would be strengthened by Tesla’s oldcorrespondence with the Light House Board that demonstrated Tesla’s “ability tosupply wireless telegraph apparatus.”18 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-675]The first case was adjudicated before France’s highest court. Tesla testifiedthat Marconi’s patent of June 2, 1896, was “but a mass of imperfection anderror. . . . If anything, it has been the means of misleading many experts andretarding progress in the right direction.”19 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-676] Judge M.Bonjean agreed, declaring Tesla’s invention had come before Marconi’s.The government’s lawsuit wound through the U.S. courts for years, with aBrooklyn district judge siding with Marconi and then the Court of Claims in 1935overturning that ruling, invalidating the Italian’s fundamental patent, andclaiming it had been preceded by Tesla. Almost another decade would pass beforethe U.S. Supreme Court weighed in on Tesla’s claim of invention.Ironically, despite his efforts to establish primacy as radio’s inventor, Teslanever embraced the actual device. “The radio, I know I’m its father, but I don’tlike it,” he said. “It’s a nuisance. I never listen to it. The radio is adistraction and keeps you from concentrating.”20 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-677]Experts took different sides in the court battles. Coming to Tesla’s defense wasJohn Stone Stone, a respected research scientist for Bell Labs in Boston.Marconi, he testified in 1916, focused incorrectly on electric radiation and “itwas a long time before he seemed to appreciate the real role of theearth. . . . Marconi’s view led many to place an altogether too limited scope tothe possible range of transmission.” Calling Tesla’s work “trail blazing,” Stonedeclared modern radio technology had “returned to the state where Tesladeveloped it.” Stone also offered what was becoming a frequent observation: “Ithink we all misunderstood Tesla. He was so far ahead of his time that the restof us mistook him for a dreamer.”21 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-678]Meanwhile, Columbia professor Michael Pupin stepped forward to take credit forthe radio: “I invented wireless before Marconi and Tesla, and it was I who gaveit unreservedly to those who followed!”22 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-679] Acknowledginghe failed to file a patent for such an important invention, Pupin thentestified, “In my opinion, the first claim for wireless telegraphy belongs toMr. Marconi absolutely, and to nobody else.”23 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-680]Tesla could not hide his shock and outrage. “Watching his fellow Serb upon thestand,” reported one newspaper, “Tesla’s jaw dropped so hard, it almost crackedupon the floor.”24 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-681] When Tesla finally testified, hesystematically documented his assertions for being the original inventor withtranscripts from public articles and speeches as well as reports from hiswireless demonstrations to large audiences in St. Louis in 1893. Tesla alsocompared the diagrams within his and Marconi’s patent applications and declared,“You will find that absolutely not a vestige of that apparatus of Marconiremains” in contemporary radio systems.25 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-682]A fellow immigrant and inventor, Michael Pupin should have been Tesla’s ally.Like Tesla, Pupin had grown up on a farm in Serbia’s military frontier. Both oftheir fathers were village leaders, their grandfathers had been war heroes, andeach had avoided military service. Pupin first arrived in the United States in1874, at the age of fifteen with only a few pennies in his pocket, and he spentseveral tough years shoveling coal for fifty cents a ton. The two youngscientists met in New York City and often discussed their early struggles, andTesla even helped Pupin master American English in order to help him hold hisjob at the telephone company.Both inventors wore their dark hair swept back and sported brush mustaches, butthey displayed different personalities, different visions, and differentapproaches to science. As one friend of both men put it, “Telsa was anintrovert, very much closed in himself and his science. Pupin was a worldlyextrovert who married in wealth and believed in wealth. Tesla was a poor saintlyman for whom science was his only reality. Our great sculptor Ivan Mestrovicused to tell me that Tesla was tormented and complex while Pupin was very jovialand easy to be with. But Tesla was deeper in his scientific efforts thanPupin.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-683]Pupin eventually won scholarships to the University of Berlin and CambridgeUniversity and he returned to America in 1889 as a respected physicist whohelped start Columbia College’s electrical engineering program. The professorinitially defended Tesla’s alternating-current system, to the point he almostlost his teaching position for “eulogizing” this new technology. The competitionbetween the immigrants developed when Pupin sided with Elihu Thomson’s claimthat he had developed the first and most effective AC motor. Even when JudgeTownsend in 1900 declared Tesla’s primacy, Pupin persisted in his criticism andincreasingly aligned himself with Tesla’s rivals, especially Thomson andMarconi.The two Serbs also had a fundamental difference of opinion regarding telephoneand telegraph lines. Pupin sought incremental improvements to the existingsystems and Tesla wanted to replace them outright with wireless technology.Tesla thrived on inventing and charmed patent regulators. Pupin worked primarilyas a professor and suffered contentious relations with the commissioner ofpatents. Pupin, for instance, filed a submission in February 1894 claiming to be“the first to make a practical application of this principle in multipletelegraphy,” but the unimpressed commissioner rejected Pupin’s claims, arguinghis ideas had been preceded by “patents by Thomson and Rice [and by] Tesla’sarticle ‘Experiments in Alternating Currents.’ ” The official went further tosay Pupin had simply “multiplied Mr. Tesla’s electric light circuits” and showedno new invention.27 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-684]Pupin retaliated with a four-hundred-page autobiography—From Immigrant toInventor—that completely ignored Tesla’s contributions to electrical science.Pupin’s book won the Pulitzer Prize in 1924, bringing attention to his versionof history. In expansive sections on alternating current, Pupin applaudedMichael von Dobrowolsky for being the first to use a three-phase system andElihu Thomson for developing the AC motor. Overlooking Tesla’s pioneeringleadership, he asserted, “If the Thomson-Houston Company had contributed nothingelse than Elihu Thomson to [General Electric], it would have contributed morethan enough.”28 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-685](Almost all other leading scientists disagreed with Pupin’s oversight. EvenCharles Steinmetz, the General Electric scientist who spent years trying tousurp or discount Tesla’s efforts, declared, “I cannot agree with [Pupin] in theleast for [a three-phase system] already existed in the old Tesla motor. . . . Icannot see anything new . . . in the new . . . ­Dobrowolsky system.”29[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-686] Bernard A. Behrend, who wrote a definitive work on theAC motor, also concluded, “The induction motor, or rotary field motor, wasinvented by Mr. Nikola Tesla, in 1888.”)30 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-687]From Tesla’s perspective, Pupin betrayed him during the Marconi patent trial.Tesla actually had asked Pupin “to testify on my behalf as a countryman,” yet hesided with the Italian. Tesla later huffed, “Let the future tell the truth andevaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present istheirs, the future, for which I really worked, is mine.”31[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-688]The Columbia College professor even refused to offer a tribute for Tesla’sseventy-fifth birthday celebration, complaining, “In the beginning of the WorldWar a difference of opinion created a split between Mr. Tesla and myself.Neither he nor I have ever had, since that time, the opportunity to cure thatsplit.”32 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-689] Yet when Pupin fell ill in 1935, he reachedout and his Serbian colleague visited. According to one account, “Teslaapproached the sick man and held his hand out and said, ‘How are you, my oldfriend?’ Pupin was speechless from emotion. He cried and tears were coming downhis face.”33 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-690] Two years after the visit, Pupin died, andTesla attended the funeral.Another scientist who should have been close to Tesla was Charles ProteusSteinmetz. Also an immigrant, born in Prussia nine years after Tesla, he, too,was a brilliant outsider. While Tesla displayed quirks, Steinmetz simplyappeared different—he was an uneven-legged, hunchback dwarf, who stood only fourfeet tall and whose feet, hands, and head appeared too big. Both men builttowers—Tesla to send wireless transmissions, Steinmetz to attract naturallightning. Both also had the capacity to do complex mathematical calculations intheir heads.Although Steinmetz defended Tesla against some of Pupin’s and Elihu Thomson’sclaims, he worked for thirty years at General Electric trying to obtainrecognition for his own alternating-current advances. In fact, he was hired byGE in 1893 to engineer his way around Tesla’s patents, and when he wrote his ownhistory of alternating current he too virtually ignored Tesla.The “little giant,” as he was known, fled Germany in 1888 when police beganharassing him for joining a socialist university group and writing articles fora local socialist newspaper. He arrived in the United States a year later.Although immigration officials initially turned Steinmetz away because of hisphysical deformities, an ­American friend argued convincingly that his mentalprowess would benefit the country. ­Steinmetz Americanized his first name from“Karl August Rudolph” to simply “Charles,” and added a middle name of “Proteus,”the shape-shifting sea god from the Odyssey who knew many secrets and oftenreturned to his human form as a hunchback.Charming and spry, often with a Blackstone panatela cigar hanging from his lipsand his pince-nez glasses perched on his nose, Steinmetz regaled scientists andsocialites alike. In his massive greenhouse, he collected rareplants—particularly cacti, ferns, and orchids as well as lethal creatures,including rattlesnakes, black widow spiders, and alligators.For many years, Steinmetz was the face of General Electric, which provided himwith a football-field-sized laboratory. Company ads exaggerated that hedeveloped alternating current, that he installed the transformers and strung thewires that made the Niagara Falls project possible, and that he was “one of themen most responsible for the electrification of America.”34[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-691]No doubt Steinmetz was responsible for innovative discoveries in hysteresis, thediscipline that studies “the lag in response exhibited by a body in reacting tochanges in the forces, especially magnetic forces, affecting it.”35[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-692] The scientist, for instance, calculated for how muchtime an iron rod maintains some of its magnetization after it has been removedfrom a magnetic field. Such mathematical formulae enabled engineers to improveelectric motors and other electromagnetic equipment.Like Tesla, Steinmetz relished thunderbolts, both generating his own andcapturing those from nature. Unlike the reclusive Tesla, however, Steinmetzoperated within a large corporate structure and understood, despite his enormousself-confidence, that inventing was collaborative.Tesla’s financial troubles continued to increase. After twenty years, theWaldorf in July 1917 asked him to leave for unpaid bills surpassing $400,000 intoday’s dollars. The Hotel St. Regis did the same seven years later in 1924. Tosatisfy a judgment, it sent a deputy sheriff to seize Tesla’s laboratoryfurnishings, but the clever inventor talked his way out of trouble by claiminghe needed his last five dollars to buy feed for hungry pigeons. The PennsylvaniaHotel also kicked him out in 1927 because the scientist’s wild pigeons, whichother residents referred to as “flying rats,” were stinking up his room andcovering the windowsills with excrement.Pigeons, in fact, became virtually Tesla’s only companions. “I have been feedingpigeons, thousands of them for years,” he admitted. The inventor even arrangedfor hotel chefs to prepare special mixes of seeds, and he visited these wingedfriends regularly, as noted previously, in Bryant Park, behind the New YorkPublic Library, often at midnight. (A corner of that park, at West 40th Streetand Sixth Avenue, now features a plaque designating it as “Nikola TeslaCorner.”) According to a reporter who spotted Tesla one evening sporting hisderby, cane, and white gloves, “Tall, well-dressed, of dignified bearing, hewhistles several times, a signal for the pigeons on the ledges of the buildingto flutter down about his feet. With a generous hand, the man scatters peanutson the lawn from a bag.”36 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-693] Another journalist joinedTesla on one of those evening walks when a policeman greeted him, “Hello, Mr.Tesla,” and confirmed that the aged scientist and his pigeon-feeding habits werewell known in the neighborhood.37 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-694]What had been an innocent attraction became a delusional obsession. Tesla spentmore than two thousand dollars once to construct, “using all my mechanicalknowledge,” a device that supported an injured bird until its bones healed. Tohelp another pigeon with a crossed beak and unable to pick up food, he broughtit back to his hotel room and fed it gently for weeks. “To care for thosehomeless, hungry or sick birds is the delight of my life,” he said. “It is myonly means of playing.”38 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-695]Finally, one particular feathered friend became his fixation, a bizarre talethat he described to John O’Neill, his first biographer, and William Laurence,science writer for the New York Times. That pigeon, Tesla said, was a “beautifulbird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. Itwas a female. I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. Iloved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. As long as I hadher, there was purpose to my life.”39 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-696]A few years later, while Tesla was lying in bed in the dark, “solving problemsas usual,” that white bird “flew through the open window and stood on my desk.As I looked at her I knew she wanted to tell me—she was dying. And then, as Igot her message, there came a light from her eyes—powerful beams of light. Whenthat pigeon died, something went out of my life. I knew that my life’s work wasfinished.”40 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-697]Tesla became increasingly remote, particularly after Robert and KatharineJohnson moved to Italy in 1920. Robert had been appointed the U.S. Ambassador toItaly—with President Woodrow Wilson rewarding the writer for his large-scalerelief efforts in that country after World War I. Katharine had been sick mostof the previous year, having been one of the first to succumb to the greatinfluenza epidemic that killed twenty million people worldwide; she died fouryears later, at the age of sixty-nine, and in a final note ordered her husbandto keep in close touch with Tesla.One old friend and a new one tried to fill the void. Long-time supporter BernardA. Behrend convinced the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company it shouldbe embarrassed by Tesla’s financial suffering in light of the benefits he hadbrought to the firm. Beginning in 1934, the firm paid Tesla a piddling onehundred twenty-five dollars a month and covered his lodging at the Hotel NewYorker, payments that Behrend and Westinghouse labeled as a “consultingcontract” since Tesla would have rejected charity. (For some comparison, GeneralElectric was paying William Stanley, another electrical pioneer on hard times, astipend of one thousand dollars a month.) The hotel at 34th Street and EighthAvenue offered some semblance of the luxury Tesla had grown used to. Costingover twenty-two million dollars to construct, the forty-three-story structurefeatured an acre-sized kitchen, five restaurants, two ballrooms, and even ahospital with its own operating room. Tesla’s suite, numbered 3327 (necessarilydivisible by three), included two rooms—sleeping quarters and a workspace. Darkdrawers, filled with papers and equipment, lined one wall, while a neat desk andchair squeezed into a tiny alcove.The new friend was Kenneth Swezey, a boyish-faced nineteen-year-old sciencewriter, who took the scientist on as a cause to protect him from obscurity.Almost fifty years Tesla’s junior, the young man developed a specialrelationship that lasted until the inventor’s death. Born and raised inBrooklyn, he had dropped out of secondary school and begun to write freelancescience articles for various journals, eventually including Popular ScienceMonthly, Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, and Life.Tesla became the focus of Swezey’s efforts, and the two often spent hours in thescientist’s apartment discussing inventions and ideas, with Tesla in hisfavorite lounging outfit of a red robe and blue slippers. They shared dinners,went to movies, and took long walks, often feeding pigeons. Swezey essentiallybecame Tesla’s assistant, publicist, confidant, and friend.Swezey recalled Tesla regularly calling him in the middle of night, “just totell me something on his mind.” The inventor, said Swezey, “spoke nervously,with pauses, animatedly, enthusiastically. He was figuring something, workingout a problem. He was comparing one theory to another, commenting, and when hefelt he had arrived at the solution he was seeking, he suddenly closed thetelephone.” Such early-morning, one-way conversations led the writer toconclude: “Tesla lived 365 days of the year in his own world, in that fantasticcombination of poetic imagination and scientific fact.”41[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-698]The independent scientist, according to Swezey, “almost never mentioned anyother friends [and] would not let me introduce him to anyone.”42[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-699] Still, the young writer became part of the informalfamily, befriending Tesla’s nephew, Sava Kosanovic, and Robert Johnson’sdaughter, Agnes.The relationship became so familiar, commented Swezey, that Tesla took togreeting him at the door stark naked. One biographer suggested Swezey washomosexual, but, other than noting the writer had never been married and hadlived his entire life in the same Brooklyn apartment, there seems to be noevidence one way or the other. Swezey himself declared Tesla to be “an absolutecelibate,” and Kosanovic, perhaps protecting his uncle (and Yugoslavia’s nativeson), went out of his way to affirm that observation.Swezey clearly admired the scientist but was not blind to his faults. If someonewere a friend, said the writer, “Tesla is all graciousness. Polite,enthusiastic, caustic at times—but always well intentioned—he looks out upon theworld, at seventy-one, with the keen insight, health, and vigor of a man offorty-five.”43 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-700] Yet Swezey admitted Tesla during his lasttwenty years “could be cantankerous at times and hard to get anything out of.”Still, the young journalist observed, “In the midst of it all, he often camethrough with periods of his old brilliance.”44 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-701]Tesla spoke to Swezey, for example, of a future with cell phones. “When wirelessis perfectly applied . . . we shall be able to communicate with one anotherinstantly, irrespective of distance,” he said. “Not only this, but throughtelevision and telephone we shall see and hear one another as perfectly asthough we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands ofmiles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will beamazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able tocarry one in his vest pocket.” Tesla even suggested one key application of theInternet by saying, “It is more than probable that the household’s dailynewspaper will be printed ‘wirelessly’ in the home during the night.”45[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-702]The inventor also talked with automobile manufacturers about a “carriage which,left to itself, would perform a great variety of operations involving somethingakin to judgment.”46 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-703] That prediction came more than ahundred years before Elon Musk began manufacturing an electric car he called theTesla and which is perfecting self-driving features, or “a great variety ofoperations involving something akin to judgment.”In 1931, Swezey organized an elaborate party to celebrate Tesla’s seventy-fifthbirthday, complete with tributes from many of the world’s leading scientists andengineers. Lee de Forest, a pioneer of radio whose Audion vacuum tube made voicetransmissions possible, observed, “No one so excited my youthful imagination,stimulated my inventive ambition, or served as an outstanding example ofbrilliant achievement in the field I was eager to enter, as did yourself.” W. H.Bragg, a winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, wrote, “I shall never forget theeffect of your experiments which came first to dazzle and amaze us with theirbeauty and interest.” Hugo Gernsback, the noted science editor, went so far asto declare: “If you mean the man who really invented, in other words, originatedand discovered—not merely improved what had already been invented by others—thenwithout a shade of doubt Nikola Tesla is the world’s greatest inventor, not onlyat present but in all history. . . . His basic as well as revolutionarydiscoveries, for sheer audacity, have no equal in the annals of the intellectualworld.”47 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-704]Swezey’s collection of tributes revealed Tesla’s poly-sided personality. Thescientist clearly inspired others, as evidenced by an executive with anelectrothermic company recalling, “I began to give consideration to the variouselectrical methods that might be employed for melting metal, my mind at oncewent back to those early demonstrations by you and the electric currents whichyou described.”48 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-705] A Cal Tech professor, who won theNobel Prize in 1923 for his work on cosmic rays, remembered the long-agodemonstration at Columbia College of Tesla’s coil and wrote, “Since then I havedone no small fraction of my research work with the aid of the principles Ilearned that night.”49 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-706]One science journal editor suggested Tesla’s mind “raced ahead so fast that itwas just impossible [with his temperament] to get everything down on paper. Thatneglect turned out to be his and our loss.” On a related note, an editorobserved, “Tesla had an exasperating way of giving evidence to anyone who couldread between the lines that he knew a whole lot more about a subject than heactually put down. He also had a perverse tendency to explain the theoreticalbasis of some of his inventions in terms contrary to those commonly held.”50[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-707]Tesla used the anniversary to reflect on aging. He avowed that “man reaches hismaximum power in his old age, not in middle life. Everyone should have a decadeor so to sum up his life work after seventy-five.”51 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-708] Healso discussed his latest idea for an ocean thermal energy conversion system,writing a paper on the opportunity entitled “On Future Motive Power.”Time magazine, learning from Swezey of the scientists’ accolades, devoted acover story in July 1931 to Tesla, whom it described as “atall . . . eagle-headed man” looking a bit like a ghost but still alert and witha sparkle in his blue eyes.52 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-709] The cover portrait waspainted by the experienced but provocative Princess Vilna Lwoff-Parlaghy,daughter of Baroness von Zollerndorff, who shared many odd traits with Tesla.While the inventor enjoyed pigeons, for instance, she kept “two dogs, an Angoracat, a bear, lion cub, alligator, ibis, and two falcons.” Also living elegantlybut on the edge financially, she had recently been kicked out of the Plaza Hotelfor unpaid bills.53 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-710]The veteran innovator, in that article, highlighted his past inventions as wellas his plans to disprove Einstein’s theory of relativity and to develop a newsource of power, to which, he claimed, “no previous scientist has turned.” Healso predicted interplanetary communication “will produce a magic effect onmankind, and will form the foundation of a universal brotherhood that will lastas long as humanity itself.”54 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-711] Communicating with otherplanets became something of an obsession, and he declared, “I would willinglysacrifice all my other achievements to realize this dream.”55[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-712]Tesla claimed in that feature article to be “leading a secluded life” but onefilled with “continuous, concentrated thought and deep meditation,” whichallowed him to develop a “great number of ideas.” The inventor said his mostserious concern “is whether my physical powers will be adequate to working themout and giving them to the world.”56 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-713]The Time magazine cover story attracted the attention of another journalist,John (Jack) O’Neill, who was a correspondent for the Herald Tribune. Thejournalist became an ardent admirer, even writing gushing poems to Nikola Tesla.Most glorious man of all agesThou wert born to forecast greater daysWhere the wonders thy magic presagesShall alter our archaic ways.Your coils with their juice oscillatingSent electrical surges through the earthSent great energy reverberatingFrom the center to the outermost girthIs the mind a power omnipresentThat fathoms the depths of all spaceThat speaks to an adolescentThe future triumphs of the race?57 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-714]Tesla thanked the young journalist “heartily” but claimed “your opinion of me isimmensely exaggerated.”58 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-715] O’Neill became an acclaimedwriter. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1937, and he wrote the firstTesla biography in 1944, entitled Prodigal Genius, which expanded on hisglorification of Tesla as a “superman” and a “scientific saint.”59[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-716]Despite enjoying such publicity and attention, Tesla rarely provided too muchpersonal information. “He was a perfect gentleman, the perfect host, courtesypersonified,” wrote O’Neill, who spent extended hours with the scientist, “butadamant in his determination to say nothing concerning himself or his work inthe presence of those who would not understand him. As a result many spectacularbut false stories have been printed about him.”60 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-717]Age seemed to have prompted more quirks. Increasingly fearful of germs, Teslacommanded the hotel staff to stay at least three feet away, and he refused totouch others, although he washed his own hands compulsively. He discarded glovesand collars after only one use. As he grew older and became more gaunt, his dietshrank, moving from meat to vegetables and then to warm milk and a concoction hecalled “factor actus,” which consisted of white turnips, cabbage hearts, whiteleeks, and about ten other vegetables. He eschewed coffee, tea, and all otherstimulants, but he continued to enjoy a bit of alcohol, which he described as a“veritable elixir of life.” He demanded his restaurant table not be used by anyother diner. According to the captain of waiters, “I had to bring him his fooddirect from the kitchen in an earthen pot and covered so nobody could look intoit. He had to have nine napkins that he could use, one by one.”61[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-718]Tesla overlooked his germ phobia with pigeons and family members. The chiefwaiter, for instance, joked about Tesla allowing the dirty birds to land allover his body and the inventor’s habit of providing them with“casseroles—Germ-free.” William Terbo, Tesla’s grandnephew who claimed in 2014to be the scientist’s only living relative, remembered meeting the elderlyinventor when he was nine. Tesla greeted the young Terbo with a traditionalSerbian hug and three kisses and went out of his way to rub the lad’s shorthair.62 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-719]Finances were never Tesla’s forte, and money increasingly confused him. “Money?What do I need it for?” he asked late in life. “I would enjoy it only if I had aroomful of this paper and I would throw it out the window.”63[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-720] One Westinghouse executive recalled Tesla picking up afew magazines at a newsstand, taking a “big roll of bills out of his outsideovercoat pocket,” handing the top bills to the newsman, and walking away withoutwaiting for change.64 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-721] On the few occasions he was flush,he bought expensive clothes, claiming “Money is a heavy burden to carry.”65[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-722]According to journalist and supporter Hugo Gernsback, “The man, who, by theignorant onlooker has been called an idle dreamer, has made a million dollarsout of his inventions—and spent them as quickly on new ones. But Tesla is anidealist of the highest order and to such men, money itself means but little.”66[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-723] A virtually penniless Tesla could do little but watchcompanies grow hugely profitable by commercializing radio, selling lightingdevices, devising robots, and developing electrotherapies—all based on hisinventions.Despite his increasing isolation from humans and modern practices, Tesla soenjoyed the media’s attention he decided to host annual press conferences oneach of his birthdays. According to one journalist, “Tesla, who all his life hasworked in seclusion and struggles to avoid publicity with all the vigor withwhich movie stars court it, permits a handful of ‘science writers’ to violatethe rules as a sort of birthday party.”67 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-724]At least one of his remaining friends feared the press was taking advantage ofTesla, that they, in order to sell more newspapers, were portraying the inventoras an eccentric old man with wild ideas. Robert Johnson complained, “Theimaginative character of Tesla’s work made him the prey of the sensationalpress, which . . . did everything it could to exploit him for its cruel andsordid purposes, with the result of making him ridiculous only to those who hadneither knowledge nor the responsibility of sober judgment.”68[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-725]Johnson, however, did appreciate that the annual gatherings informed a broaderpublic who “remained ignorant of the principles of which [Tesla] was a profoundmaster and which technically were beyond their ken.” As evidence of the need forsuch education, Johnson recalled an English lady who said to Tesla, even afterhe was famous for capturing the power of Niagara and sending electricity tolight New York City:“And you, Mr. Tesla, what do you do?”“Oh, I dabble a little in electricity.”“Indeed! Keep at it, and don’t be discouraged. You may end by doing somethingsomeday.”69 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-726]At the 1932 press event, Tesla introduced his concept for a new motor powered bycosmic rays. In 1934, he outlined, with detailed diagrams, a weapon that could“send concentrated beams of [mercury] particles through the free air, of suchtremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes ata distance of two hundred fifty miles from a defending nation’s border and willcause armies of millions to drop dead in their tracks.”70[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-727] The seventy-eight-year-old scientist, while drinking aquart of boiled milk, predicted his “death beam” would offer every country an“invisible Chinese wall” and make war impossible. The following year, for hisseventy-ninth birthday, Tesla announced a pocket-sized but powerful oscillatorthat could destroy buildings. The eightieth birthday conference featured aten-page statement, largely about cosmic rays, that also revealed his exerciseregimen, which included several hundred toe wriggles each night before bed, andhis prediction of living for 135 years.71 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-728]It was the 1933 event that offered particularly poignant insights into the agingyet insightful scientist. Aware many scoffed at his ideas, Tesla stated, “Theycalled me crazy in 1896, when I announced the discovery of cosmic rays. Againand again they jeered when I developed something new and then, years later, sawI was right. Now, I suppose, it will be the same old story when I say I havediscovered a hitherto unknown source of energy—unlimited energy that can beharnessed.”72 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-729]Asked if he were satisfied with his accomplishments, Tesla responded, “If I weresatisfied, I’d be lost. It is the challenging problems that remain that keep megoing.”73 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-730]Thomas Edison died in 1931—at the age of eighty-four and at his home “Glenmont”in West Orange, New Jersey—leaving Tesla without his one-time hero and oft-timesrival. Despite their different styles, the two in their later years hadmaintained a cordial exchange of letters, with Tesla congratulating Edison on“the marriage of your charming daughter” and Edison often addressing his notesto “Friend Tesla.”74 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-731] In public, Tesla could becomplementary, as when he applauded the Wizard of Menlo Park during the EdisonAward ceremony. Yet in Edison’s New York Times obituary, Tesla alone offeredcriticism, saying his competitor’s “method was inefficient in theextreme . . . [and he] had a veritable contempt for book learning andmathematical knowledge.” Tesla called Edison “by far the most successful and,probably, the last exponent of the purely empirical method of investigation,”and he reproached the great experimenter’s approach by saying, “If he had aneedle to find in a haystack, he would not stop to reason where it was mostlikely to be, but would proceed at once, with the feverish diligence of a bee,to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search.”75[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-732] The ever-tidy Tesla even mocked Edison’s slovenlyhabits: “If he had not later married a woman of exceptional intelligence, whomade it the one object of her life to preserve him, he would have died manyyears ago from consequences of sheer neglect.”76 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-733]No doubt the two experimenters took different paths. Edison ended up rumpled butrich, while Tesla became poor but dapper.77 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-734] Yet theywere among the last of the independent, cross-disciplinary, industrial ageinventors, and both watched the arrival of corporate research centers and a newgeneration of nuclear physicists.In what became almost a parlor game, journalists and scientists compared the twogeniuses. Gernsback with Electrical Experimenter argued Edison “is not so muchan original inventor as a genius in perfecting existing inventions. In thisrespect, Tesla has perhaps been the reverse for he has to his credit a number ofbrilliant as well as original inventions which, however, have not beensufficiently perfected to permit commercial exploitation.”78[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-735] Tesla, in one of his more prideful moments, defined thecontrast by saying: “Edison’s work on the incandescent lamp and direct-currentsystem of distribution was more like the performance of an extraordinarilyenergetic and horse-sensed ­pioneer than that of an inventor; it was prodigiousin amount, but not creative.” He would praise Edison for his “vigorous pioneerwork” but Tesla complained that all the Wizard of Menlo Park “did was wrought inknown and passing forms” while he, Tesla, contributed “a new and lastingaddition to human knowledge.”79 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-736]Tesla further suggested the distinction was between “the inventor, who refinedpreexisting technology, and the discoverer who created new principles.” He puthimself in the second group and Edison in the first and argued “placing the twoin the same category would completely destroy all sense of the relative value ofthe two accomplishments.”80 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-737] Edison, of course, probablywould have said it differently; many scientists and journalists highlighted hisproven ability to bring original discoveries to commercial fruition.Although Edison lost the “War of the Currents,” he clearly won the struggle forpublic recognition. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, forinstance, features six large pictures of Edison in the center of its extensiveelectricity exhibit, but only a small portrait of Tesla hangs on a side wall.Tesla’s revolutionary AC motor is not even included in the case of innovativedevices. Sensing a plot, Samuel Mason with the Tesla Science Foundation saidSmithsonian Institution officials told him the museum displayed little aboutTesla because they thought the scientist was not a United States citizen.81[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-738] They told Mason they simply viewed Edison to be “anAmerican icon” whose prominent images would attract more visitors.Tesla deserves more popular attention. While Edison produced ubiquitous consumerproducts such as incandescent lights and phonographs, Tesla devised systemsusing alternating current and wireless high-frequency transmissions. No doubtthose systems underpin our modern economy, even if they are little understood bythose of us who benefit from them.Increasingly withdrawn, Tesla kept up with—and sometimes commented on—currentaffairs. Despite his previous frustrations with J.P. Morgan, he came to thatbank’s defense when it fell under federal investigation. He commended theEvening Post for criticizing the government’s actions: “The undignifiedcharacter is brought into evidence more and more, and it is becoming apparenteven to the dullest observer that the honor and reputation of this famousbanking house is resting on a foundation as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar.”82[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-739]While the scientist wasn’t particularly political, he periodically offered hisopinions. He considered prohibition, for instance, to be “a drastic, if notunconstitutional, measure.”83 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-740] Years later, he foundFranklin Roosevelt’s New Deal to be “destructive to established industries, anddecidedly socialistic,” yet he incongruously followed Roosevelt “with admirationbordering on awe,” declaring the president to be “the greatest genius whoappeared in the potential arena in five hundred years.”84[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-741] Shocking to today’s readers, Tesla in his old ageembraced eugenics and proposed “sterilizing the unfit and deliberately guidingthe mating instinct. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal personto mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.”85[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-742] The inventor’s hard-to-label political views also couldbe surprisingly reformist, as when he said the “struggle of the human femaletoward sex equality will end in a new sex order, with the female assuperior. . . . It is not in the shallow physical imitation of men that womenwill assert first their equality and later their superiority, but in theawakening of the intellect of women.”86 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-743]As evidence of his multiple interests, Tesla also kept up with boxing, afascination that began when he battled a bully in Lika and grew after he metJohn L. Sullivan, the heavyweight champion whom he referred to as a friend and“a great, baby-minded fellow, very likable.”87 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-744] Teslaclaimed close relationships with Jimmy “Midland Mauler” Adamick as well as theYugoslav Fritzie Zivic, the former welterweight boxing champion who dined withthe scientist whenever he visited New York City.Tesla, of course, approached boxing as a scientist, suggesting his “mechanicalprinciples” allowed him to predict winners. Declaring Gene Tunney to be “atleast a ten-to-one favorite” over Jack Dempsey, Tesla observed, “What counts ina contest of this kind is quickness of response. The more skillful man who can[move backward], while at the same time defending himself, can reduce greatlythe intensity of his antagonist’s blows while keeping his own effective. Toillustrate: If a fighter attacked back with half the speed of the assailant’sblow, the force of the impact will be reduced to one-half, while the energy ofthe impact will be reduced by one-quarter. Tunney is far superior in quicknessof response.”88 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-745] (Tunney indeed won the fight, but onlyafter the referee offered a “long count” while Tunney was floored in the seventhround.)Year after year, reporters continued to attend the inventor’s birthday pressconferences, eager to fascinate readers with the eccentric genius’s visions ofthe future. A writer with New York World-Herald provided some color to the 1935event: “Twenty-odd newspapermen came away from his Hotel New Yorker birthdayparty yesterday, which lasted six hours, feeling hesitantly that something waswrong either with the old man’s mind or else their own, for Dr. Tesla was serenein an old-fashioned Prince Albert and courtly in a way that seems to have goneout of this world.”89 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-746] As Tesla’s thoughts became moreprescient than practical, journalists obtained good copy but scientistsincreasingly mocked the aging inventor as an “idealist” with “fantastic”notions.Reporters paid particular attention to the so-called death beams because itappeared Tesla was actually developing a high-powered gun. Inside this weapon,Tesla claimed, his magnifying transformer and a unique vacuum chamber chargedminute mercury or tungsten pellets and shot them out in a narrow stream. In1937, he wrote a treatise—The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersiveEnergy through the Natural Media—which described his “superweapon that would putan end to all war.”90 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-747] Hugo Gernsback popularized Tesla’sidea in Electrical ­Experimenter by hiring the illustrator Frank Paul,considered the century’s most gifted science fiction artist, to prepare coverdrawings of Tesla’s superweapon showering death beams onto incoming ships. (Thedrawings and Tesla’s serialized memories helped boost the newsletter’scirculation to about one hundred thousand readers.)Tesla tried unsuccessfully to sell the gun’s design to military officials invarious countries, including the United States and Britain. Records suggestTesla in 1935 received twenty-five thousand dollars (equivalent to almost fourhundred fifty thousand dollars today) from the Amtorg Trading Company, analleged Soviet front firm for developing weapons, to “supply plans,specifications, and complete information” for producing a death beam gun.91[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-748] (Such an alleged payment is hard to reconcile withTesla’s documented poverty.) The weapon also gained the attention of a couple ofthieves, or spies, who broke into his laboratory and scrutinized his papers;Tesla argued they “left empty-handed” and could learn nothing because he keptall the device’s important details in his head.92 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-749] Again,the world eventually caught up with Tesla’s ingenuity, for as one media outletseveral years later put it, “His death beam bears an uncanny resemblance to thecharged-particle beam weapon developed by both the United States and the SovietUnion during the cold war.”93 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-750]The annual publicity attracted an assortment of players wanting to capitalize onTesla’s fame and ideas. One was Titus deBobula, a Hungarian-born arms dealer andarchitect of churches, apartment buildings, and mansions. The racketeer,however, rarely paid taxes, aligned himself with pro-Hitler organizations, andwas charged with selling rifle grenades and gas bombs in an effort to overthrowthe Hungarian government. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover even put him on a watchlist. Still, deBobula tried to befriend Tesla, commending the scientist forrejecting the Jewish Albert Einstein’s relativity theories and even offeringblueprints and financing to reconstruct Wardenclyffe. Tesla eventually declinedthe offer and “resolved to fight my own battles.”94 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-751]As Tesla developed his “machine to end war,” he reflected on the link betweenreligion and science, the latter, he said, being “opposed to theological dogmasbecause science is founded on fact.” Although raised by a family of priests andsometimes calling himself “deeply religious,” he rejected the Christian view ofan all-powerful god, suggesting instead that “the universe is simply a greatmachine which never came into being and never will end.” To Tesla, the “soul” or“spirit” was “nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. Whenthis functioning ceases, the ‘soul’ or the ‘spirit’ ceases likewise.”95[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-752] He did concede to a few superstitions, including hispreference “to make important communications on Fridays and the thirteenth ofeach month.”96 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-753]Tesla’s one religious ritual was recognition of his Slava day, perhaps the mostimportant annual event for a Serbian family. This partly religious and partlysocial festival pays tribute to one’s patron saint, which for Tesla wasNicholas, a bishop in Myra in the fourth century honored for miraculously savingfrom death three unjustly condemned men. (Some accounts say Nicholas’s saintlydeed instead was to rescue three girls from prostitution by throwing three bagsof gold as dowry into their window at night.) In the Julian calendar used by theSerbian Orthodox Church, Tesla’s Slava day occurred on December 17, when theinventor often would dine with the Johnsons and receive greetings from GeorgeWestinghouse and other colleagues. The inventor admitted praying periodically tohis patron saint, although he lamented that in his later years St. Nicholasseemed to have “forgotten me.”97 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-754]The inventor continued to seek money . . . and be rejected. He tried to interestthe U.S. government in the death beam, saying he would work on it “until Icollapsed,” yet he added something obviously unacceptable: “I would have toinsist on one condition—I would not suffer interference from any experts. Theywould have to trust me.”98 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-755]As early as 1913, not long after J. P. Morgan died, Tesla approached his sonJack but made little headway. He initially tried flattery, suggesting the youngfinancier was “moved by the same great spirit of generosity which has animatedyour father, and I am more than ever desirous of enlisting your interest andsupport.” He subsequently tried to convince the investor that he had learned tobe a pragmatist, even while revealing he remained a financial romantic. “I am nolonger a dreamer but a practical man of great experience gained in long andbitter trials. If I had now twenty-five thousand dollars to secure my propertyand make convincing demonstrations, I could acquire in a short time colossalwealth.” He then made his pitch—“Would you be willing to advance me this sum ifI pledged to you these inventions?” The younger Morgan declined.99[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-756]Despite financial frustrations, Tesla regularly expressed joy and hopefulness.In a 1935 letter to a friend, he wrote: “My life, despite some adversity, washappy and even now I have the same love for work I had in my youth.”100[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-757] On another occasion, he said, “My life has been sowonderful that it almost surpasses fiction. Every great desire I have ever hadhas invariably materialized.”101 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-758] Tesla acknowledged hisbouts with depression but also boasted: “In the main my life is very happy,happier than any life I can conceive of.”102 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-759]Tesla had much to be proud of. By the late 1930s, just as the inventorpredicted, most American towns were wired for electricity, and families spenttheir evenings in bright rooms listening to radio broadcasts. They enjoyed suchlaborsaving motorized devices as vacuum cleaners, washing machines, stoves,toasters, irons, and hot-water heaters. To appreciate electricity’s popularity,consider that in Muncie, Indiana, a midsized Midwestern town, 95 percent ofhomes by 1930 had electricity, even though more than a third lacked a bathtuband a fifth still relied on outhouses.The inventor, however, was not without regrets, even if he expressed themrarely. After Robert Johnson assembled and mailed early newspaper articles aboutTesla’s alternating-current inventions, Tesla admitted, “The old clippings youhave forwarded are a sad reminder of my former folly. I had thirty-six patentson my system of power transmission in which billions are invested now. I havewon every suit without exception and had it not been for a ‘scrap of paper’ [thecontract he tore up for George Westinghouse] I would have received in royalties­Rockefeller’s fortune.”103 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-760]The financial strain led to Tesla’s declining health; moreover, in 1937, at theage of eighty-one, he was hit by a taxi and thrown to the ground while on hisdaily walk in Manhattan. He rejected medical treatment and managed to limp home,where he virtually stayed in bed for six months. (On the night of this accident,even though suffering from shock, a wrenched back, and three broken ribs, Teslaarranged for a Postal Telegraph messenger to purchase pigeon feed and bring itto his hotel.) He never fully recovered from these injuries, and he walkedthereafter with a cane.In that same year, Tesla lost his longtime friend, Robert Johnson, who hadfulfilled his wife’s demand that he stay in touch with Tesla; he died at the ageof eighty-four. The sequestered Tesla showed more and more signs of senility,often getting lost or forgetting addresses and events. One morning, for example,he fervently directed a messenger to deliver an envelope with money to 35 SouthFifth Avenue for Mark Twain—although the address did not exist and SamuelClemens had died years before. Growing heart problems, moreover, occasionallycaused him to faint.Tesla claimed to have been born from long-living stock, yet, recognizing hisnumerous youthful brushes with death and his strenuous work schedule, it’ssomewhat remarkable he survived into his eighties. The average life expectancyfor males was then only sixty years. Noting Thomas Edison lived untileighty-four and Alexander Graham Bell until seventy-five, there might be somehealth benefits to an inventor’s lifestyle.A Westinghouse company representative talked with Tesla in 1939, when theinventor was eighty-three, and found him “to be thoroughly clear-headed” and hisvoice “sounded buoyant and enthusiastic.” Although Tesla wouldn’t let thisassistant to a vice president upstairs, they chatted on the Hotel New Yorkerline for about ten minutes and the inventor “was profuse in his thanks for mycalling.”104 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-761]Tesla spent most of that and subsequent years in his room. By 1942, he wasconfined to bed. He avoided former colleagues and permitted no visitors, exceptfor summoned hotel staff. Insisting he was not ill, he refused to see a doctor.Nikola Tesla died in his sleep in room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker on the snowyevening of January 7, 1943, the Serbian Christmas Eve, at the age of eighty-six.A floor maid, Alice Monaghan, discovered the scientist’s body the followingmorning, and an assistant medical examiner, Dr. Weinberg, ruled he had diedsuddenly of natural causes and the “police say nothing suspicious.” Theyreported his sunken and emaciated face appeared composed, which is reflected ina death mask made later that day.More than two thousand people attended the services at four o’clock on January12 at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Episcopal Bishop William Manningagreed to hold the event but, noting the simmering conflicts between Croats andSerbs, demanded that there would be no political speeches made. For the firsttime in twenty years, the New York City landmark unlocked its great “goldendoors” in order to accommodate the crowd. American and Yugoslav flags draped thecasket, and the ceremony was conducted in Serbian by Orthodox priests. Thefuneral was considered an official state function by the Yugoslav government,which posted a dozen soldiers around the casket.New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia offered a tribute on the radio. Thepresident and Eleanor Roosevelt sent a letter expressing their gratitude forTesla’s contributions “to science and industry and to this country.”105[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-762] Vice President Henry Wallace wrote, “In Tesla’s deaththe common man lost one of his best friends.”106 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-763] ThreeNobel Prize winners in physics eulogized the inventor as “one of the outstandingintellects of the world who paved the way for many of the importanttechnological developments of modern times.”107 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-764] DavidSarnoff, president of RCA, said, “Tesla’s mind was a human dynamo that whirledto benefit mankind.”108 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-765]The honorary pallbearers provide a sense of the regard key scientists had forthe eccentric inventor. They included Dr. Ernest F. W. Alexanderson of theGeneral Electric Company, inventor of the Alexanderson alternator; ProfessorEdwin H. Armstrong of Columbia University, inventor of frequency modulation andmany other important radio devices; Dr. Harvey C. Rentachler, director of theresearch laboratories, Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company; ColonelHenry Breckenridge; Dr. Brando Cubrilovich, Yugoslav Minister of Agriculture andSupply; Consul General D. M. Stanoyavitch of Yugoslavia; and Professor WilliamH. Barton, curator of the Hayden Planetarium.The New York Times’ obituary described Tesla as the “father of radio and ofmodern electrical generation and transmission systems.”109[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-766] John O’Neill, the award-winning science writer andTesla’s first biographer, called him “a superman who created a newworld . . . [and] unquestionably one of the world’s greatest geniuses.”110[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-767] Dr. Edwin Armstrong commented, “The world, I think, willwait a long time for Nikola Tesla’s equal in achievement and imagination.”Commenting on Tesla’s place in history, Hugo Gernsback in ElectricalExperimenter wrote, “Important as were his accomplishments, he deservesattention as a dreamer.” Noting “there was no limit to the range of hisimagination,” the journalist predicted historians “will bracket Tesla with DaVinci or with our own Mr. Franklin. . . . One thing is sure, the world, as werun it today, did not appreciate his peculiar greatness.”111[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-768]That theme of being a man ahead of his time appeared again and again in thetributes. Tesla indeed had lived in flux. He was born during a lightning stormat the stroke of midnight, between today and tomorrow. He was raised a Serb intoan Orthodox family in a region dominated by Croats and Roman Catholics. Hisfather instilled religion while Tesla embraced science. This inventor cravedisolation but could be a master showman. He enjoyed lavish living but walkedaway from lucrative contracts. He won the “War of the Currents” but died almostpenniless and feeding pigeons. Tesla was one paradox after another. Maybe we allare, but Tesla’s personality seemed based on paradox.One science writer concluded, “He was so far ahead of his contemporaries thathis patents often expired before they could be put to practical use.”112[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-769] Another calculated that Tesla made at least fiveoutstanding scientific discoveries—cosmic rays, artificial radioactivity,disintegrating beam of electrified particles, electron microscope, andX-rays—that others “rediscovered” up to forty years later and for which theythen won Nobel Prizes.113 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-770] Speaking of Tesla’s visionarywork, Major General J. O. Mauborgne, former chief signal officer for the U.S.Army, stated: “Those of us who grew up with the early wireless art and arefamiliar with his researches and contributions to science revere his memory asthe greatest genius in the early wireless field. He was so far ahead of his dayin the concept of the transmission of intelligence through space that the worldnever fully realized that Tesla was the real inventor of wireless transmissionand reception as well as many other wonderful developments.”114[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-771]Perhaps the most balanced tribute came from the New York Sun: “He was aneccentric, whatever that means. A nonconformist, possibly. At any rate, he wouldleave his experiments and go for a time to feed the silly and inconsequentialpigeons in Herald Square. He delighted in talking nonsense; or was it? Grantingthat he was a difficult man to deal with, and that sometimes his predictionwould affront the ordinary human intelligence, here, still, was an extraordinaryman of genius. He must have been. He was seeing a glimpse into that confused andmysterious frontier which divides the known and the unknown. . . . but today wedo know that Tesla, the ostensibly foolish old gentleman, at times was tryingwith superb intelligence to find the answers. His guesses were right so oftenthat he would be frightening. Probably we shall appreciate him better a fewmillion years from now.”115 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-772]Numerous scientists added their praises for Tesla’s pathbreaking work onelectricity, radar, and robots, while still others suggested that more of thisgenius’s insights—on topics ranging from interstellar communication to thewireless transmission of power—would soon bear fruit, and he would be recognizedas prophetic. Eight months after his death, in fact, the U.S. Supreme Courtfinally ruled Tesla as the true inventor of radio."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE [06_Contents.xhtml#bm1]BOLDNESS OF IGNORANCE [06_Contents.xhtml#bm1]While Nikola Tesla died peacefully, his passing and his lack of a will sparkedboth international intrigue and conspiracy theories. The world in 1943 writhedin the midst of war, and the inventor’s designs for death beams suggestedpowerful weapons that could benefit the military of any country obtaining them.The resulting scheming was perhaps most pronounced in the Slavic countries,where Tesla had become something of a hero. According to one writer, “Everypeasant is familiar with Nikola Tesla, who left ­Yugoslavia as an emigrant boyto become a famous scientist in ­America.”1 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-773] A priestrecalled “that Serbs loved to buy cigarette papers on whose cover is a pictureof Nikola Tesla with his name printed, and on the back of the cover thispoetical verse was printed: ‘Be happy all Serbs, especially those in Lika, whichhas given us such a Serb—genius.’ ”2 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-774]That fame placed Tesla unwittingly in the center of political debates. Perhapshis last formal meeting in the Hotel New Yorker was with King Peter II ofYugoslavia. Peter had become king in 1934, when he was only eleven, but hisfather’s cousin served as regent. Prince Paul signed a pact with the Nazis inMarch 25, 1941; two days later, a British-supported coup d’état overthrew theregent and placed the seventeen-year-old Peter in charge; yet within two weeks,German-led forces invaded ­Yugoslavia, which surrendered on April 17, and Peterfled by climbing down a drainpipe. In 1942, the now-eighteen-year-old exiledmonarch came to the United States to plead, unsuccessfully, for aid from­President Franklin Roosevelt. To garner popular support for his cause, themonarch also met with Tesla. Although shocked by the aged Tesla’s ashenappearance, Peter discussed his country’s plight and his hope the inventor wouldreturn and help save Yugoslavia from the Nazis. The king, in his diaries,claimed the two men wept together “for all the sorrows that had torn apart[their] homeland.”3 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-775]At least, according to the exiledYugoslav government, Tesla responded to the king: “I am proud to be a Serb andproud to be a Yugoslav. Preserve Yugoslavia for us.”4 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-776](Peter fled in April 1941 to Egypt and then to London, where he married a Greekprincess, his third cousin. Leading the opposition to the Nazis withinYugoslavia was Joseph Tito, who tried to finance his efforts by freezing theking’s overseas assets. Peter returned briefly to his country and attempted toreassert his authority and gain access to his family’s gold, but Tito in 1945disbanded the monarchy; the United States immediately recognized the newgovernment, although it acknowledged “with some reservations on its domesticpolicies.” Peter fled to the United States, where he eventually got a job at theSterling Savings & Loan Association in Los Angeles; he died in ­Denver inNovember 1970 after suffering for many years from cirrhosis of the liver.)5[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-777]Sava Kosanovic, Tesla’s nephew (the son of his younger sister, Marica), played akey and controversial role in the inventor’s final months—and the subsequentdistribution of his papers. He had been a member of the Royal YugoslavGovernment in 1941, fled into exile when the country was invaded, and organizedPeter’s meetings in 1942 with Roosevelt and Tesla. After the war, however,Kosanovic backed Joseph Tito, a rising Croat leader and Communist supporter, andhe became the ambassador to the United States for the Federal People’s Republicof Yugoslavia. Kosanovic convinced his ailing uncle, who had supported KingPeter, to send a letter to Tito encouraging his efforts to form a socialistgovernment.The nephew also pushed to have himself named administrator of Tesla’s estate andto have the famous inventor’s papers sent to Belgrade, where Yugoslavia hadproudly established a Tesla museum. In the midst of a war, however, the U.S.government expressed skepticism of ­Kosanovic’s allegiances. The FBI and otheragencies also were well aware that Tesla claimed to have developed a death beam;allegedly, this weapon could whip our armies and aircraft—something the Americanauthorities did not want to fall into the hands of their adversaries. Tesla,moreover, had sparked concern within the FBI when he gave an innocent speech in1922 on his scientific discoveries to the Friends of Soviet Russia. Unconfirmedrumors suggested Tesla had kept two secret laboratories (to which no journalistwas invited) on Manhattan’s East Side underneath the 59th Street Bridge, nearSecond Avenue.6 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-778] Also troubling to the FBI, although theinventor had offered his death-beam designs to the U.S. military, was the beliefthat he’d sold the construction plans to a Soviet agent of the Amtorg TradingCorporation. J. Edgar Hoover went so far as to title a memo “Espionage” andwrote that he feared Kosanovic “might make certain material available to theenemy.”7 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-779]Shortly after Tesla’s death, Kosanovic, Kenneth Swezey, and George Clark,director of an RCA museum and laboratory, entered Tesla’s apartment with alocksmith and the hotel’s managers. They claimed to have removed only threepictures and the testimonial book Swezey had compiled for the inventor’sseventy-fifth birthday. Kosanovic, however, later complained that some journalswere missing from his uncle’s rooms, including a large black notebook he knewTesla kept, and he hired a lawyer to investigate and obtain control of all hisuncle’s possessions. The FBI, meanwhile, arrived at the apartment shortlythereafter and alleged someone had taken “valuable papers, electrical formulas,designs, etc.” Of particular interest was a missing “large box or container inhis room near the pigeon cages” that the inventor had told someone “containedsomething that could destroy an airplane in the sky.”8 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-780]The Bureau declared the government to be “vitally interested” in preservingTesla’s documents and turned the case over to the Office of the Alien PropertyCustodian (OAPC), which had jurisdiction since Kosanovic claimed control of thepapers and was not a U.S. citizen. The OAPC spent weeks trying to locate andimpound all of Tesla’s papers and belongings, and officers even searched thevarious hotels where Tesla had resided. Investigators eventually seized “ 12locked metal boxes, 1 steel cabinet, 35 metal cans, 5 barrels and 8 trunks.”9[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-781]The FBI interviewed scores of Tesla acquaintances, including a hotel manager whodescribed Tesla as “very eccentric, if not mentally deranged during the past tenyears, and it is doubtful if he has created anything of value during thattime.”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-782] Kenneth Swezey, who had spent substantial timewith the aging inventor, described the potential for state secrets to be a“legend” that resulted from Tesla being a “recluse . . . who liked to talk inmystifying terms during his later years.”11 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-783]Still, the War Policies Unit of the Department of Justice ruled the inventor’spapers needed to be scrutinized by military experts. To evaluate the sensitivityof Tesla’s writings, OAPC hired John Trump, director of the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology’s High Voltage Research Laboratory. Trump was a safe butodd choice: safe because he was a respected engineer who served as a technicalaide to what is now the CIA’s Office of Scientific Intelligence; odd becauseTesla had mocked the effectiveness of MIT’s Van de Graaff generator, whichfeatured two thirty-foot towers and two fifteen-foot-diameter balls. Much toTrump’s and MIT’s dismay, Tesla contended that his own relatively tiny coil,standing only two feet tall, provided more voltage and current.(Trump’s résumé came to feature several other distinctions. He received theNational Medal of Science, was elected to the National Academy of Engineering,and was the uncle of Donald Trump, the forty-fifth president of the UnitedStates. While campaigning, Donald Trump said of his relative: “I had an unclewent to MIT who is a top professor. Dr. John Trump. A genius. It’s in my blood.I’m smart. Great marks. Like really smart.”)12 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-784]John Trump initially investigated a trunk at the Hotel Governor Clinton, whosemanager years earlier had accepted as payment for Tesla’s debt. Tesla claimedthat inside was a “device” worth ten thousand dollars, which would detonate ifopened by an unauthorized person. When Trump and the government officialsapproached the trunk, “the hotel manager and employees promptly left the scene.”Even Trump expressed reluctance to proceed, and he tried to muster courage bylooking outside and remarking on the day’s pleasant weather. He slowly removedthe surrounding brown paper and discovered “a handsome wooden chest bound withbrass.” Trump cautiously opened the lid and found, much to his relief, a “box ofthe type used for Wheatstone bridge resistance measurements—a common standarditem found in every electric laboratory before the turn of the century.”13[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-785]In the presence of two investigators from the OAPC and three from NavalIntelligence, the professor also spent three days at Manhattan Storage reviewingthe contents of numerous boxes and trunks. Trump reported, “It is my opinionthat the Tesla papers contain nothing of value for the war effort, and nothingwhich would be helpful to the war.” He went further, saying Tesla’s “thoughtsand efforts during at least the past fifteen years were primarily of aspeculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character often concernedwith the production and wireless transmission of power; but did not include new,sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results.” In closing,Trump wrote, “I can therefore see no technical or military reason why furthercustody of the property should be retained.”14 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-786]Despite that conclusion, John Trump asked for a top secret classification ofTesla’s 1937 paper entitled The New Art of Projecting ConcentratedNon-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, which offered equations andschematics for how a particle-beam weapon could destroy planes and tanks. Thedocument, which one biographer described as “written virtually as a patentapplication,”15 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-787] outlined a system to propel minutemercury particles at forty-eight times the speed of sound, something Trump saidwas “succinctly described” but would “not enable the construction of workablecombinations of generator and tube even of limited power.”16[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-788]Trump’s findings did little to retard conspiracy theories. One, according tobiographer Marc Seifer, asserted: “Secret agents break into Tesla’s New YorkerHotel safe without Kosanovic knowing, remove keys to his Hotel Governor Clintonvault, and steal the death-ray prototype, substituting the equipment Trump founda week or two later.”17 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-789] Seifer also interviewed ananalyst supposedly working with the Office of Strategic Services (now theCentral Intelligence Agency) who claimed to have interviewed Tesla and read hisunpublished papers during the scientist’s final months. Angry those papers were“hauled away . . . behind the Iron Curtain,” this analyst said, “the conspiracy[to block access to Tesla’s writings] was massive and extremely complex, goingback to J. Pierpont Morgan and his wish to suppress Tesla’s wireless powerdistribution inventions because they threatened to provide cheap or free powerfor the masses.”18 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-790] Leland Anderson, an engineer andwriter who gushingly considered Tesla to be “a super-nova in the galaxy of thehuman race,” argued it was common knowledge at the time of Tesla’s death thatthe “FBI confiscated, withheld, or examined Tesla’s estate.”19[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-791]Filmmakers Joseph Sikorski and Michael Calomino wrote a screenplay, Fragmentsfrom Olympus: The Vision of Nikola Tesla, highlighting a mysterious plane crashover the Atlantic Ocean on January 15, 1943, which killed FBI agents PercyFoxworth and Harold Dennis Haberfeld. The previous day, according to thefilmmakers, those investigators had reviewed Tesla’s papers and devices andreportedly were on “a secret mission of critical importance” to brief GeneralDwight D. Eisenhower when their military transport fell from the sky forunexplained reasons.20 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-792]Perhaps the most bizarre conspiracy theory suggests that George Scherff, Tesla’slongtime office manager, had settled in Germany, where his son was recruited byAdolf Hitler to return to the United States to spy on and eventually kill Tesla.This incredible tale then had George Scherff, Jr., change his name to GeorgeHerbert Walker Bush and become the forty-first president of the United States.21[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-793]Even though the FBI marked its Tesla file “Closed” in late 1943, the U.S.government did not release any of the scientist’s belongings and notes to theBelgrade museum until the fall of 1951. Tesla’s body, meanwhile, was taken afterthe funeral ceremony to Ferncliffe Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, where it wascremated, which is unusual in the Orthodox Church, although Tesla’s favoriteSerbian poet, Zmai Iovan Iovanovich, strongly advocated for it. Tesla’s ashesremained in the United States until February 1957, when they were returned tothe land of his birth.images [Images/com.jpg]We might not be able to unravel the various conspiracy theories, yet NikolaTesla did reveal a great deal about inventing. Tesla’s style certainly wasunconventional, as evidenced by his envisioning a revolutionary electric motorwhile walking in a Budapest park reciting Goethe poems. His creative processfocused on both dreaming and investigating. “After experiencing a desire toinvent a particular thing,” Tesla allowed an idea to “roam around in myimagination and think about the problem without any deliberate concentration.”Only then would he “choose carefully the possible solutions of theproblem . . . and gradually center my mind on a narrowed field ofinvestigation.”22 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-794]No single process or form of intelligence dictates inventiveness. As for theEdison-Tesla debate, Tesla possessed an eidetic memory, able to recall images inhis mind, while Edison tended to sketch and revise. Tesla imagined prototypes,Edison tinkered. Tesla’s neat office reflected his cerebral efforts, in contrastto Edison’s workbench, which was littered with wires and coils he could piecetogether.Tesla argued that inventing was hard work. “My belief in a law of compensationis firm,” he said. “The true rewards are ever in proportion to the labor andsacrifices made.”23 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-795] Tesla, however, went further,suggesting invention could even be painful. That day quoting Goethe in aBudapest park, the inventor claimed to have wrestled from nature the vision ofan alternating-current motor “against all odds, and at the peril of myexistence.”24 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-796]He maintained inventing also required patience. “The trouble with manyinventors,” he contended, is “they lack the willingness to work a thing outslowly and clearly and sharply in their mind.” Tesla argued experimenters shouldnot try their first idea right off. “We all make mistakes,” he said, “and it isbetter to make them before we begin.”25 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-797]Tesla, moreover, argued an effective inventor possessed “instinct,” which hedefined as “something which transcends knowledge. We have, undoubtedly, certainfiner fibers that enable us to perceive truths when logical deduction, or anyother willful effort of the brain, is futile.”26 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-798]He believed the joy of inventing went beyond the accumulation of profits. “Thedesire that guides me in all I do,” he said, “is the desire to harness theforces of nature to the service of mankind.”27 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-799]Despite discovering totally new concepts, Tesla sometimes leaned toward amechanistic theory of life, similar to what Descartes propounded three hundredyears before. As evidence, Tesla referenced the contemporary experiments inheliotropism that “clearly [establish] the controlling power of light in lowerforms of organisms.”28 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-800] “We are automata,” he wrote,“entirely controlled by the forces of the medium, being tossed about like corkson the surface of the water, but mistaking the effects of the impulses from theoutside for free will.”29 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-801]Tesla may have been the last of the individual inventors. Today’s science isdone mostly by groups within national laboratories or giant corporations. LelandAnderson, who also assembled a comprehensive Tesla bibliography, observed thatthe “day of the lone pioneer and wealthy patron had passed, and for Tesla theadjustment to working with a developmental staff was untenable.”30[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-802]John Hays Hammond, Jr., an inventor and investor who had tried to work withTesla, lamented the demise of “curiosity-driven” research in the face of “theoverly focused research setting of today’s corporate and academic structure.”31[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-803] He suggested that “for Tesla scientific research was anemotional experience.” Tesla himself described his exhilaration for inventing:“I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart likethat felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding tosuccess,” he exclaimed. “Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends,love, everything.”32 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-804]Despite the shift toward institutional inventing, the United States remainsenamored with its entrepreneurs and their breakthroughs. Steve Jobs and SteveWozniak have become legends for developing the personal computer in a Palo Altogarage, and the same is true for Larry Page and Sergey Brin launching anInternet search engine while still college students and raising their initialfunds from family and friends. Yet these modern entrepreneurs are known mostlyfor their commercial successes and their abilities to build large corporationsthat often incorporate or perfect the inventions of others—attributes that werenot ­Tesla’s strong suits. Still, like these innovators, Tesla struggled tothink creatively, secure financing, protect patents, and market ideas. Althoughborn more than one hundred-sixty years ago, his story remains relevant to ournation’s character and future technological innovations.In fact, we have great need today of Tesla’s example of selfless out-of-the-boxthinking if we are to tackle our twenty-first-century challenges. Hiscreativity, his fresh perspectives on nature, would be particularly valuable inthe electric-power industry he helped create. In the century since Samuel Insullconverted electricity generators into regulated monopolies, risk-averseutilities have become the chief source of pollution and are resistant tocreative entrepreneurs. Tesla understood the enormous waste and pollutionassociated with generating electricity, and he championed efficiency. Heappreciated the inexhaustible power of the sun’s rays, wind, falling water, andheat from within the earth, and he consistently sought new means to captureclean energy. He appreciated the need to bring drudgery-reducing power toeveryone, which now includes some two billion people around the world withoutelectricity access. He understood the negative health consequences of burningcoal and other fossil fuels.Although Tesla, living today, might not devise the means to transmit powerwithout wires or cost, he probably would lead a charge for sustainability andagainst the carbon pollution that is changing our climate. His drive forinnovation and efficiency also would improve the generation and delivery of akey component of our electronic-centric economy.images [Images/com.jpg]It’s tempting to use modern psychological labels to describe Tesla. His ritualssuggest obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). His social awkwardness and hisliving in his own world could be symptoms of Asperger’s syndrome. Hislate-in-life fixation with pigeons might signify dementia or Alzheimer’sdisease. His frequent withdrawals into himself suggest schizophrenia. While suchdiagnoses probably have some degree of accuracy, Tesla was more complex than anylabels. Beyond the presence of quirks and obsessions, his early story was markedby cultural isolation, the loss of a beloved brother, and the failure to meethis anguished father’s hopes. He compensated with strict self-discipline, andthat myopic focus advanced both brilliant insights as well as odd passions.One psychology professor argued Tesla “suffered repressed guilt feelingsassociated with the untimely death of his older brother Dane when Tesla was fiveyears old. In the throes of the Oedipal complex and admittedly over-attached tohis mother, young Niko experienced great trauma not only because Dane wasDjouka’s favorite son but also because Niko was at that age of gaining hissexual identity.” Although Tesla’s traumatic childhood experiences certainlyinfluenced him throughout his life, this New Age analyst went too far to suggestTesla sought “older brother/mother surrogates [in] strong, maturing authorityfigures, such as Westinghouse and Pierpont Morgan.”33 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-805]No doubt this unconventional intellect struggled with depression. Tesla could behighly charming but then become withdrawn. He enjoyed spurts of great energy,followed by spells of deep despondency. Perhaps that struggle actually fueledhis creativity. Tesla’s mind, suggested his admirer Kenneth Swezey, had “to besomewhat unbalanced to overcome the momentum of flighty enthusiasm or theinertia of destructive conventionalism.”34 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-806]Even outside of psychiatry, Tesla was hard to label. He was criticized for beingharsh, arrogant, and egotistical. As evidenced by his time in Pittsburgh, he hada hard time working well with others. Yet a longtime assistant fondly recalled,“His genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanlycharacteristics that were so ingrained in his soul.”35 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-807]Another colleague claimed he had “a magnetic personality, but was quiet, almostshy.”36 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-808] A friend acknowledged his “distinguishedsweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force.”37[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-809] Several reporters described him as mesmerizing andcapable of conveying an enthusiasm for life and discovery. Another journalistobserved “he has that supply of self-love and self-confidence that usually goeswith success. And he differs from most of the men who are written and talkedabout in the fact that he has something to tell.”38 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-810]Contemporaries often commented on Tesla’s strict and obsessive routines. Hisdinners—first at the ritzy Delmonico’s restaurant and later at the lavishWaldorf Astoria Hotel—began promptly at 8:10 p.m. He or an assistant would havecalled in his order ahead of time—often thick steaks, preferably filetmignon—and only the head waiter would be allowed to serve the meals. He usuallyread the afternoon paper at his regular table by the window. Tesla dined alone,except when he entertained a group of reporters or investors, and he oftenreturned after dinner to his lab for several hours of additional work. Hevisited barbers three times a week for half-hour scalp massages. He never atelunch. He took warm baths, followed by lengthy cold showers. To stimulate hisbrain cells, he walked regularly, often up to ten miles a day, and he would flexhis toes one hundred times before going to bed in order to relieve stress.Concerned about neatness, he dressed meticulously, regularly in a black derby,silk shirt, cane, green suede high-tops, and gray suede gloves—but absolutely nojewelry.When overwhelmed by stress, Tesla deployed “a safety device” that served as hisalternative to vacations. Reflecting the era’s racism, he said, “When I am allbut used up, I simply do as some of the colored races, who naturally fall asleepwhile white folks worry.” Since Tesla believed tension pushed his body toaccumulate a toxic agent, he compensated by sinking “into a nearly lethargicstate, which lasts for exactly half an hour.” Upon awakening, Tesla claimed “afreshness of mind and ease with which I overcome obstacles that had baffled mebefore.”39 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-811]It could be said that Tesla’s eccentricities eclipsed his genius. Yet Tesla’svarious habits and quirks do not detract from what that freshness of mindenvisioned. He saw nature differently, offered insights that changed our world,and created the core foundations of our modern economy. As one writer observed,“Tesla figuratively saw the world in ways that no one else did in part becauseTesla literally saw the world in ways that no one else did.”40[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-812]Tesla, perhaps because he was an outsider in so many ways, paid little heed tothe scientific establishment’s views about what was impossible. This interloperwith a vivid imagination claimed to possess the “boldness of ignorance.”41[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-813]Tesla’s was an often misjudged brilliance. He enjoyed both practical successesas well as prophetic visions. No doubt some of the inventor’s suggestions werejust plain crazy, yet he proved consistently able to foresee technologies of thefuture. “I think we all misunderstood Tesla,” wrote one contemporary scientist.“We thought he was a dreamer and visionary. He did dream and his dreams cametrue; he did have visions but they were of a real future, not an imaginaryone.”42 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-814]In the seventy-five years since his death, Tesla has become something of ageek’s hero. This loner and polymath is admired for directing mysteriouselectricity to do his bidding. He’s revered for offering major and disruptiveinsights, particularly when today’s technological advances tend to be boringlyincremental and devised by specialized teams within large organizations.Like all lives, Tesla’s was filled with “what ifs.” What if Charles Peck hadlived longer and offered Tesla the level-headed business guidance he so needed?What if J. P. Morgan had not been distracted by his mergers and provided Teslawith another contribution? What if Tesla’s brother Dane had not died? What ifWestinghouse had not asked to cancel ­Tesla’s royalty payments?Perhaps most interestingly, what if Tesla had married Anna? We know this prodigyenjoyed the company of both women and men but he believed an effective scientistneeded to be isolated. “Be alone, that is the secret of invention,” he declared.“Be alone, that is where ideas are born.”43 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-815] Teslaadmitted falling in love with Anna as a young man, and he later exchangedregular and personal correspondence with the wife of his best friend, yet heasserted, “I never touched a woman.”44 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-816] Only near the endof his life did Tesla question his seclusion, telling one reporter: “Sometimes Ifeel that by not marrying, I made too great a sacrifice to my work.”45[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-817]images [Images/com.jpg]The inventive and unconventional Tesla has attracted his share of eccentrics.Margaret Storm, for instance, maintained that the transcripts for her biography“were received on the Tesla set, a radio-type machine invented by Tesla in 1938for interplanetary communication.” According to Storm, whose book was printed ingreen ink, “Tesla was a Venusian, brought to this planet as a baby in 1856 andleft in a remote mountain province in what is now Yugoslavia.”46[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-818] Another biographer, Arthur Matthews, contended he andTesla had worked together and “traveled many times to nearby planets aboardVenusian spacecraft and that Tesla, as late as 1970, was still alive, living asan extraterrestrial.”47 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-819] Yet another biographer suggestedTesla was “a wizard from another world who threw thunderbolts from the sky.”48[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-820] One New Age writer described Tesla as an “illuminati,”49[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-821] part of a secret society allegedly pulling the levers ofpower and controlling world events. The terrorist responsible for releasingsarin gas in Tokyo’s subway system admired Tesla and planned to steal from theTesla Museum in Belgrade Tesla’s schematics for an earthquake-provokingoscillator. Mystic healers, running expensive seminars entitled TeslaMetamorphosis, have claimed long-distance therapeutic rays could cure cancer andbirth defects. Some conspiracy theorists even suggested Tesla’s death beamaccidentally caused the Tunguska Event on June 30, 1908, that destroyed some twothousand square kilometers of the Siberian taiga.50 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-822]The inventor, however, seems to be gaining increased recognition within popularculture. The U.S. Postal Service dedicated a stamp to Tesla, EncyclopediaBritannica ranked him among the ten most interesting historical figures, andLife magazine placed him among the one hundred most famous people of the lastmillennium. He was played by David Bowie in The Prestige (2006), a movie aboutdueling magicians, and he is the focus of The American Side (2016), a film thathas an actor asking if Tesla invented something and the lead characterresponding, “Yeah, the 20th Century.” Tesla’s name graces Nvidia’s new line ofadvanced microchip processors. The International Electrotechnical Conferencenamed the unit used to measure the strength of a magnetic field—the “tesla,”symbol “t”—after him, only one of three Americans ever so honored. He’s featuredin a comic strip by Matthew Inman, creator of the popular website“TheOatmeal.com,” that explains why Tesla (and not Edison) is history’s greatestscientist. And Tesla is a character in the video game “Dark Void Saga,”prompting one commentator to observe: “You know you’d gone into mainstream popglory when you’re in a videogame aimed at eighteen-year-old boys.”51[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-823] Perhaps most notably, Elon Musk used Tesla’s name forhis high-end electric car—distinguished for its technological mastery, sleeklines, and environmental vision—which uses a version of the AC motor Tesladesigned.Wardenclyffe on Long Island also is getting a new lease on life. The propertywas purchased in 1939 by the Peerless Photo Company that manufactured emulsionsfor photographic film and paper; in 1969, Agfa, a giant German firm, took overthat operation, but production ceased in 1987 and the facility began to decay.Decades of pollution landed the site on the state’s Superfund list, from whichit was finally released, after substantial cleanup, in spring 2012. About a yearlater, a nonprofit group, originally known as Friends of Science East and now asthe Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, raised through crowd funding almost$1.4 million to purchase the scientist’s laboratory and surrounding property,with the goal of restoring and converting it into a science museum. Adocumentary film entitled Tower to the People reports on that effort andincludes an appearance by Penn Jillette of the comic team Penn & Teller. Thepresident of the Republic of Serbia visited the site in September 2013 todedicate a statue of Nikola Tesla. In July 2014, Elon Musk, responding to anemail appeal from the nonprofit group, contributed one million dollars to therestoration effort. Hundreds of volunteers from around the world have helpedclear debris, with one man referring to the site as a cathedral and anotherclaiming it was an “honor to mow Tesla’s grass.”52 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-824]Tesla’s Lika birthplace also has been rebuilt after the Ustashi, theultranationalist Croatian group, riddled his home with bullets and toppledseveral structures as part of its ethnic and religious war in the 1990s againstSerbs and Jews. Now the site—including Tesla’s home, his father’s church of St.Apostles Peter and Paul, as well as a multimedia center—is a popular touristattraction.Tesla’s growing profile reflects in part his principled belief that technologyshould transcend the marketplace and that invention should not just be tied toprofits. He aimed high, perhaps higher than any other inventor. He workedtirelessly to offer electric power freely to the world, to build automatons thatwould reduce life’s drudgery, and to provide machines that could abolish war. Henever accepted the status quo. Whether or not his discoveries enriched himpersonally, he persevered, with optimism and a love of his process.Hypersensitive and eccentric, ingenious and starry-eyed, he was, concludedScience magazine, “driven by inner forces which made sheer creation the mostimportant thing in his life.”53 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-825]"},{"pageContent":"ILLUSTRATIONSimages [Images/i-13.jpg]Tesla at twenty-three.images [Images/i-1.jpg]Tesla at twenty-five.

Ancient Egyptian texts from 2750 B.C.E.described electric fish as the “Thunderers of the Nile.” Thales, a brilliantGreek philosopher, wondered some 2,600 years ago at the ability of amber, ayellowish-brown and translucent resin, to attract straw when it had been rubbedagainst a piece of fur or wool, the same property Tesla noted when he pet hisbeloved cat. In fact, the Greek word for amber is “elektron.”William Gilbert, one of Queen Elizabeth’s physicians, explored the connectionbetween electricity and magnetism, and Otto von ­Guericke in the mid-seventeenthcentury constructed the first machine to generate bursts of power. During thatsame period, German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist and Dutch scientist Pieter vanMusschenbroek independently developed a device—named a Leyden jar after the cityof ­Musschenbroek’s experiment—that could “store” static electricity betweenlayers of foil in a glass jar. In addition to being a key tool for scientists,that rudimentary battery allowed electricity to become something of a sideshowwonder. To bedazzle King Louis XV, Abbe Jean-Antoine Nollet assembled sevenhundred friars at a monastery in Paris and somehow convinced them to join handsin a large circle, the first man gripping one electrical contact of a Leydenjar. When the last friar touched the other electrical contact, he completed thecircuit, allowing the electric charge to flow through them all. Seven hundredmonks simultaneously hopped into the air, and the king and his court gasped withdelight.In September 1752, Benjamin Franklin supposedly flew a kite in a gentle rainwith a metal key attached to the end of the string, drawing the electricalcharge within the storm cloud to flow from the kite to the key. A Swedishscientist who tried a similar experiment a year earlier died when lightningstruck the rod he was holding above his head. A bit smarter, Franklin stoodinside a doorway and took hold of a dry silk ribbon rather than the wet string.An entranced public sought more sparks and crackles, but almost no one thoughtelectricity could do anything useful. Even Franklin was “chagrined that we havebeen hitherto able to produce nothing in this way of use to mankind.”1[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-826] In fact, the Leyden jar’s output was limited, and thedischarges from static electricity and lightning came in bursts that were hardto control. A ready and steady movement of electrons is needed for a dependablepower source, and a series of scientists and inventors spent decades figuringout how to generate and control that movement.Michael Faraday in 1821, for instance, demonstrated that spinning magnets withina loop of wire generated an electric current. James Clark Maxwell, a professorat Cambridge University, tackled the problem mathematically; he proved thatlight was electromagnetic radiation, or electricity vibrating at a very highfrequency. Joseph Henry, an American scientist and first secretary of theSmithsonian Institution, built an embryonic electric motor in 1829. ThomasDavenport, a Vermont blacksmith, devised a battery-powered machine in 1837 thatdrove a small printing press. Heinrich Hertz proved that electric sparkspropagate electromagnetic waves into space, envisioning the potential for radioand wireless communication.Perhaps the first practical application of this mysterious form of energy camefrom Humphrey Davy, an English chemist who in the early nineteenth centurydemonstrated an electric-arc lamp, consisting of two carbon rods separated by athin gap; when Davy applied an electric current to one of the electrodes, aglowing arc leaped across the gap and provided light. Some sixty years later,Charles Brush installed twelve outdoor arc lamps to brighten Cleveland’sdowntown, but they could not capture the residential market, in part because thedangerously high electric currents had to be kept well away from people, andbecause the lamp’s four thousand candlepower created a glare too bright for anyhome. Enter Tesla, Thomas Edison, and scores of other inventors andentrepreneurs.images [Images/com.jpg]To get a sense of what electricity and Tesla wrought, consider the first hour ofyour day. You wake to an electrically triggered alarm, take a shower madepossible by an electric water pump and water heater, and perhaps use a blowdryer or electric shaver. You drink coffee from an electric coffee maker, whichis also on a timer, pour orange juice from a carton stored in the refrigerator,and slide bread into the toaster. You check your emails on a smart phone orcomputer and listen to the weather report and news on a radio. You may push abutton on your keys to unlock your car or in your car to lift the garage door.It was Tesla’s inventions that paved the way not only for our all-electric homesbut also for radio and remote control.The MIT School of Engineering challenges its students to think “of five thingsyou do or touch in a day that do not involve electricity in any way, were notproduced using electricity, and are not related to your own body’s internal usesof electricity.” After a pause, the professor declares, “Nice try, but no way,you can’t do it.”2 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-827]While electricity pervades our modern society, its profound impacts are recent.Only two or three generations ago, rural residents lived in houses that reliedon candles and kerosene lamps for light and on wood-burning stoves for heat andhot water. The first cooler often was a leaky chest on the back porch into whichfifty-pound blocks of ice had to be hefted. Only one or two generations ago,families began to enjoy running water warmed by an electric heater. Wash stillhad to be run through a hand-powered wringer and clothes were hung outside todry. Just in the 1960s did wall-mounted air conditioners make hot summer daysmore tolerable. Meanwhile, today’s teenagers cannot imagine how their parentssuffered through school without computers, electronic games, or cell phones.Life without abundant electricity required fatiguing work. Rural residentschopped wood, which they stacked and carried inside to boil water. Starting andregulating the stove proved to be an art form, and burning wood producedunbearable temperatures in the summer. Even lighting a kerosene lamp proved tobe tricky; if the wick was too high, the lamp would smoke, and it regularly hadto be readjusted. Most chose to keep their residences dark after sunset. (Sometwo billion people—mostly rural residents in Africa, Latin America, andAsia—still lack access to electricity and its laborsaving powers.)Contemporary fuels also limited a city’s design. Only a hundred years ago, teamsof horses or smoky locomotives pulled the only forms of public transportation,rendering impossible a commute from the suburbs. Stairs curtailed buildingheights to just a few stories. Factories and their workers were forced to locatenear waterways where power wheels could be constructed. Inventors and investorsrecognized fortunes were to be made with a lighting and power system thateliminated these limitations.The switch to electricity, however, was not guaranteed. Thomas ­Edison viewedgas companies as his “bitter enemies,” and he complained that they were “keenlywatching our every move and ready to pounce upon us at the slightest failure.Success meant world-wide adoption of our central-station plan. Failure meantloss of money and prestige and setting back our enterprise.”3[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-828] Gas lighting systems had evolved throughout theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries as wicks, enclosed containers, and polishedreflectors continued to improve. The 1859 discovery of oil sparked a boom inkerosene lighting, displacing whale oil and volatile compounds drawn from heatedcoal, and investments in the gas industry had soared from $6.5 million in 1850to $72 million in 1870. Yet Edison understood a gas system’s shortcomings—eachgas lamp, for instance, had to be lighted and snuffed out individually; theflame flickered and emitted small quantities of ammonia and sulfur; fumes wouldblacken the glass globe, as well as the interior of homes; and people often feltsick after a gaslight sucked the oxygen from a room. The innovator arguedelectricity offered a clearly better alternative.Electricity’s advance altered everyday routines. When the only option was coldwater from a tap or outside well, many people used commercial laundries to washtheir clothes or public bathhouses to clean themselves. With the arrival ofelectric water heaters and pumps, according to historian David Nye, “bathingbecame more frequent, laundering at home required less work, and washing disheswas easier.” Even the accepted standards of cleanliness were altered: “Peoplechanged their clothes more often, and one bath night or one laundry day a weekwas no longer enough. Instead of dragging rugs outside a few times a year andbeating them, the whole house could be vacuumed once a week.”4[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-829]Electrical terms and the concept of being connected even invaded common speechin the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As Nye explained, amusical performance could be “electrifying” and would “recharge” the listener.An intelligent man could usually “make the connection” and seldom “got his wirescrossed.” An effective organizer was “plugged in” to a “network.”5[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-830]The growing electrification also changed a home’s orientation. Families had beenrelatively independent when they relied on wood they chopped or kerosene theybought from a store. Yet the growing network of power cables, according tohistorian Thomas Schlereth, “required political and economic decisions bygovernment and corporate enterprises” that captured additional authority throughzoning ordinances, fire regulations, and building codes.6[12_Notes.xhtml#fn-831]images [Images/com.jpg]An electric current results from the mysterious movement of electrons betweenatoms, the basic building blocks of matter. As we’re taught in elementaryscience classes, electrons are the negatively charged particles orbiting thenucleus of an atom. Electricity basically features excited electrons that travelinfinitesimal distances to displace each other in their orbits, but the currenttravels at nearly the speed of light, a staggering 186,000 miles per second. Itdoes not move through hollow power lines; instead these solid, usually copper,wires enable stimulated electrons to bump into their atomic neighbors, creatinga force.One analogy is to line up a dozen pool balls, each one touching the next, in aperfectly straight line. When you hit the ball on one end the ball at the otherend will almost immediately move. The other balls, in this case similar tojumping electrons, move only a little, often back and forth, but the rippleeffect—in this case, the forward-moving electric current or electromagneticforce—is lightning fast.Another comparison can be made to a tidal wave, which essentially is a vibrationthat moves a large amount of energy through the ocean without moving a largeamount of actual water. As explained by science historian Christopher Cooper,“Electrons themselves do not have to move from one place to another in order tocreate an electrical current. Rather, what we observe as the flow of electricalcharge is an impulse of energy that moves through a collection of electrons (andother charged particles) like a kind of vibration, passing from electron toelectron.”7 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-832]Unlike other fuels or forms of energy, we can’t see electricity. We only get toobserve the work it does.We’ve only known how to use electricity less than one hundred fifty years. Infact, when engineers were asked to name the twentieth century’s greatestaccomplishment, they passed over the automobile, internal combustion engine,airplane, and computer chip in order to vote for the system that generates anddistributes electricity.Most of us share a rudimentary understanding of electricity generation andconsumption. A power plant may burn coal or catch the wind, and the resultingelectricity travels over wires hung on poles and threaded into our homes. We tapthis current by flicking switches or plugging cords into wall outlets. We’refamiliar with some of the engineering terms, too. Electricity, for instance, canbe measured in volts (essentially the pressure through the wires), withhousehold electricity at 120 volts, car batteries at 12 volts, and flashlightbatteries at 1.5 volts. Electricity use is measured in watts (essentially therate at which electricity is consumed), with incandescent lightbulbs at 60 or100 watts and microwave ovens and hair dryers at 1,000 or 1,200 watts.We’re less familiar with several other terms. “Frequency,” which Tesla keptincreasing, refers to the rate of an alternating current’s oscillations.“Resistance,” tracked in ohms, measures how something, particularly a wire,reduces the current flowing through it. “Ampere,” or amp, represents thestrength of the current, or the amount of charge transiting over time; one ampof current flows through a typical incandescent bulb, while a hair dryer usesabout twelve amps. A “joule,” having a bit more complicated definition, is “theenergy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes througha resistance of one ohm for one second.”8 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-833] “Horsepower”is a term James Watt, a Scottish engineer, devised in the early nineteenthcentury to compare the output of steam engines to the power of draft horses; itmeasures the rate at which work is done. A “kilowatt-hour” equals the amount ofpower consumed in an hour by ten 100-watt lightbulbs. Finally, materials thatallow current to flow easily, such as copper wires, are called “conductors” andthose that don’t, such as cotton, are referred to as “insulators.”The basic electrical formula is P = I × V. “P,” as you might guess, measures theamount of power, or the work done by an electric current; it is measured inwatts. “I” refers to the current, although it references the French term“intensité de courrant,” and is measured in amperes or amps. “V” stands forvoltage or pressure and, as you might guess, is measured in volts. The formulaessentially means power (watts) equals current (amps) times voltage (volts). Asan example, a lightbulb is doing one watt of work when it is connected to aten-volt power supply and one-tenth of an ampere of current is flowing throughthe lamp. That formula would read: P = 0.1I × 10V = 1 W (watt). Put another way,a 100-watt lightbulb in your house would need ten amps at ten volts.The truth is that even physicists don’t fully understand the ­fundamentalproperties of an electrical charge. At a high level, the engineering behindgenerating electricity usually begins with spinning—burning fuel, flowing water,or blowing wind turns a turbine. That mechanical energy then spins loops ofcopper wire inside a magnet (or a magnet past a coil of wire), forcing electronsalong the wire to jump from one copper atom to another and create an electricalcharge.The symmetry of electricity can seem magical. Wind a wire around an iron coreand then spin it between the poles of a large magnet and you have generatedelectricity. Reverse the process, run the current through the core, and you haveproduced mechanical rotation. One novelist described this balance by noting an“electrical motor is simply the generator’s inverse.”9 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-834]Those motors now power our computers, air conditioners, elevators, subways, andvirtually every other aspect of our modern economy. As noted previously, Tesladescribed electricity generation: “We wind a simple ring or iron with coils; weestablish the connections to the generator, and with wonder and delight we notethe effects of strange forces which we bring into play, which allow us totransform, to transmit, and direct energy at will.”10 [12_Notes.xhtml#fn-835]The power coming from such an electric generator is called alternating current(AC) since the direction of its flow alternates like a wave (specifically, asine curve). Think of a point on a waterwheel; mapping its change of directionalong a straight line would give you the same wave (half the time, the point onthe wheel is moving up and the other half it’s moving down). Sixty times persecond according to standards in the United States and fifty times per second inEurope. AC’s big advantage is that it can travel—its voltage (or pressure) canbe adjusted fairly easily with a transformer, allowing generating companies tosend high-voltage power efficiently over long distances, saving money andallowing the use of large motors and machines. Another transformer—the oftensilvery gray cylindrical boxes atop some distribution poles along your street orback alley—steps the power down to the safe voltage used by lightbulbs and mostappliances in your home."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS [06_Contents.xhtml#bm3]Writing often is a lonely process, but this book has benefited from lots ofhelpful people.Special thanks to Leona and Jerry Schecter, my literary agents who have beenpatient, persistent, and thoughtful.
