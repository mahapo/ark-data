Recent work implies that the ZPF may play an even more signiØcant role as the source of inertia and gravitation of matter. Furthermore, this close link between electromagnetism and inertia suggests that it may be fruitful to investigate to what extent the fundamental physical process of electromagnetic radiation by accelerated charged particles could be interpreted as scattering of ambient ZPF radiation. This could also bear upon the origin of radiation reaction and on the existence of the same Planck function underlying both thermal emission and the acceleration-dependent Davies-Unruh eÆect. If these Øndings are substantiated by further investigations, a paradigm shift would be necessitated in physics. An overview of these concepts is presented thereby outlining a research agenda which could ultimately lead to revolutionary technologies. Keywords: zero-point Øeld; ZPF; stochastic electrodynamics; quantum electrodynamics; quantum vacuum; inertia; gravitation; dark matter; mass; relativity Introduction and Overview In 1901 Planck was successful in deriving a closed mathematical expression that Øt the then recent measurement of the spectral distribution of thermal radiation by hypothesizing a quantization of the average energy per mode of oscillation [1]. This new formulation avoided the so-called ultraviolet catastrophe , the unphysical prediction of classical theory readily derivable from energy equipartition that the blackbody spectrum should diverge to inØnity as ∫ 3 . Planck derived the well-known blackbody function, Ω ( ∫;T ) d∫ = 8 º∫ 2 c 3 μ h∫ e h∫=kT ° 1 ∂ d∫; (1) in which the ∫ 3 catastrophe is overcome by the exponential denominator resulting from his substitution of discrete for continuous energy intervals. The expression is factored here to show the two components of density of modes (i.e. number of degrees of freedom per unit volume) times the thermal energy per mode in the frequency interval d∫ . As discussed in detail in Kuhn's monograph Black Body Theory and the Quantum Discontinuity: 1894{1912 [2], Planck himself remained skeptical of the physical signiØcance of his mathematical assumption and of his apparently new constant, h , for over a decade. In 1913 Bohr [3] made quantization of atomic energy levels a postulate, thereby laying a foundation for quantum physics based upon Planck's unit of quantization. That same year Einstein and Stern published a paper [4] studying the interaction of matter with radiation using classical physics and a model of simple dipole oscillators to represent charged particles. They remarked 1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"that if, for some reason, such a dipole oscillator had a zero-point energy, i.e. an irreducible energy even at T =0, of h∫ , the Planck formula for the radiation spectrum would result without the need to invoke quantization. a In 1916 Nernst published an article [6] in which he proposed that the Universe might actually contain enormous amounts of such zero-point radiation. In fact, the existence of such a zero-point Øeld (ZPF) had been Ørst envisaged by Planck around 1910 when he formulated his so-called second theory: namely an attempt to derive the blackbody spectral formula with a weaker quantization assumption. It was Nernst who captured the paramount thermodynamic implications and relevance of such a sea of background radiation and became the main proponent of this concept. Both Planck and Nernst used the correct (1 = 2) h∫ form for the average energy of the zero-point electromagnetic ∞uctuations instead of the h∫ value assumed later by Einstein and Stern; the h∫ assumption is correct for the sum of interacting harmonic oscillators plus the energy of the electromagnetic Øelds. The electromagnetic blackbody spectrum including ZPF would then be: Ω ( ∫;T ) d∫ = 8 º∫ 2 c 3 μ h∫ e h∫=kT ° 1 + h∫ 2 ∂ d∫: (2) While this once again appears to result in a ∫ 3 ultraviolet catastrophe, that is not the case because this component now refers not to measurable excess radiation from a heated object, rather to a uniform, isotropic background radiation Øeld that cannot be directly measured because of its homogeneity. This approach to understanding the blackbody spectrum was not developed further thereafter, and was in fact essentially forgotten for the next Øfty years. What happened instead was that with the success of quantum mechanics, and then quantum electrodynamics, the generalization and existence of an equivalent to the ZPF, the quantum vacuum, was taken to be a consequence of quantum laws. In other words, a quantum version of the ZPF became an accepted part of physics whose existence was interpreted as being due to quantum laws. In recent years there has been a growing interest in reviving the original semi-classical approach and exploring its ramiØcations. The motive until recently, besides gaining intuitive insights and calculational ease, has been to see to what extent various quantum phenomena could be explained solely on the basis of classical physics with a random perturbing radiation Øeld | the ZPF | providing quantum-like ∞uctuations. This would (again) reverse the cause and eÆect of ZPF vis-a-vis quantum physics. This area of physics is known as Stochastic Electrodynamics , SED. For a recent short but still comprehensive review see [7] which also gives valuable references to other older but thorough reviews. SED is also discussed in the monograph by Milonni [8]. The general idea that the origin of quantization was to be found in some classical stochastic subquantum background was very much in the air among the founders of modern physics [9]. In 1966, Nelson published a seminal paper [10] stating: We shall attempt to show in this paper that the radical departure from classical physics produced by the introduction of quantum mechanics forty years ago was unnecessary. An entirely classical derivation and interpretation of the Schrƒ odinger equation will be given, following a line of thought which is a natural development of reasoning used in statistical mechanics and in the theory of Brownian motion. Examining the Heisenberg uncertainly principle Boyer [11] showed that for the harmonic oscillator the ∞uctuations caused by the ZPF on the positions of particles are exactly in agreement with quantum theory. Recently Rueda [12] has arrived at the Schrƒ odinger equation, albeit in a restrictive context that invokes a ZPF-induced Brownian-motion model. The most optimistic outcome of the SED approach would be to demonstrate that classical physics plus a classical electromagnetic ZPF could successfully replicate all quantum phenomena, a situation which would undermine some of the present ontological basis of quantum physics. While successful up to a point, SED has not yet achieved this. As dramatic as a substitution for quantum physics would be on the part of SED, recent studies have identiØed even more profound roles that the ZPF may play in the foundation of physical laws, the constitution of matter, and the structure of the Universe. (1) The inertia of matter may be due to a Lorentz force-like electromagnetic interaction between charge at the quark or fundamental lepton level and the ZPF [13, HRP]. (2) There appears to be an analogous electromagnetic vacuum origin for gravitation | as there would neces- sarily be from the principle of equivalence | an idea originally proposed by Sakharov [14] [15]. It needs a Several such derivations of the blackbody function using classical physics with a real zero-point Øeld but without quantization have been published by Boyer; cf. [5] and references therein. 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to be shown that this can be made mathematically equivalent to curved space-time. The approach that Einstein took in 1911 [16] (with later corrections [17]) involving a speed of light which is dependent on gravitational potential, c (©), suggests a promising avenue. (3) Matter and the concept of mass would appear to be secondary phenomena arising out of charge-ZPF interactions: energy, charge and electromagnetic Øelds being primary. (4) The creation of electromagnetic radiation by accelerated charge may possibly be interpretable as scattering of ambient ZPF radiation. In stationary frames the scattering of ZPF radiation by a dipole is an equilibrium process [18]; the asymmetry in the scattering process when an accelerated dipole is viewed from a stationary laboratory frame would appear to be the source of what is customarily interpreted as radiation emitted by accelerated charge (see pp. 114{120 of [19]). (5) In the ideal case of the Bohr atom, the stability of the ground state of the hydrogen atom can be attributed to energy absorption from the ZPF rather than Bohr's postulated quantum prohibition [11] [20]. (6) Spontaneous emission can be interpreted at least in part (one half of it to be precise) as emission stimulated by the background ZPF. As McCrea has argued [21], this places the ZPF in the role of a kind of universal clock governing seemingly spontaneous phenomena. (7) Even within general relativity, non-gravitational accelerations require a frame of rest that is absolute in either the Newtonian or the Machian sense [22][23][24]. However owing to special relativity, such a frame cannot be absolute with respect to uniform rectilinear motions. This seemingly impossible requirement is actually met by the ZPF. Owing to its ∫ 3 spectrum it has a Lorentz invariant energy density spectrum, yet acquires certain asymmetries as viewed from an accelerating frame ::: which leads, among other things,we think, to inertia, thus providing a quantitative, modern version of Mach's principle [HRP]. (8) The structure of the Universe on the largest scale | voids and sheets | can be attributed to the ZPF via an Einstein-Hopf type acceleration process [25][26][27]. The same acceleration process may also underlie cosmic rays [5][28]. The objective of this paper is not to establish the veracity of these paradigm-shifting possibilities; some are clearly speculative at this time, e.g. in the case of (8), caveats exist concerning the Einstein-Hopf process. A recent evaluation of this appears in a review published by de la Pe~ na and Cetto after acceptance of this paper [29]. Our goal is to present an overview of reasonably justiØed conclusions concerning the ZPF based upon published work and to extrapolate to new research programs that may come about, clearly identifying speculations as such. The intellectual and perhaps even technological rewards that would be forthcoming should such a research agenda succeed may attract innovative scientists to examine these possibilities in su±cient detail so that in a few years we may know whether this approach has been an intoxicating but illusory deadend or the path to a new paradigm for the next millenium. If the ZPF is real, why is it not detectable? The most universal real radiation Øeld we are familiar with today is the cosmic micr owave bac kground (CMB). While the NASA COBE measurements, published in 1992, Ønally found minute inhomogeneities, to high precision the CMB can be considered as quite uniform and isotropic, yet readily detectable. That being the case, why is the ZPF not equally evident? The ratio of the two is simply the ratio of the two terms in eqn. (2) taking T =2 : 73 K. At the 53 GHz-frequency middle band of the COBE DiÆerential Micr owave Radiometer this ratio would be Ω ZPF =Ω CMB =0 : 77. Even more dramatically, in the optical spectrum, eqn. (2) predicts that the ZPF should be about two orders of magnitude brighter than the Sun. Why are we not blinded by the ZPF? To Ørst order, in the absence of special conditions (discussed below), the ZPF is isotropic and homogeneous in its spatial distribution. This must be the case even inside matter due to the characteristics of the ZPF that dipole transitions absorb and re-emit this isotropic, ∫ 3 radiation without change in spatial or spectral distribution [11][18]. Therefore matter that might ordinarily be considered opaque to radiation of a given frequency eÆectively passes on the ZPF radiation without attenuation, i.e. the radiation may be absorbed and re-emitted many times, but the net eÆect is nil. In such fashion the ZPF resists direct observation. Only deviations \\above\" the ZPF are measurable. To second order, however, the presence of the ZPF can be registered indirectly, not on the basis of absorption and reemission, but rather by correlation or interference eÆects. In the case of closely-spaced atoms or molecules, 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"for example, the absorption and reemission of the ZPF radiation results in the generation of secondary short- range Øelds (even at temperatures of absolute zero) that, because of their correlating eÆects, result in short-range attractive forces: the so-called van der Waals forces. Similarly, in a macroscopic version of the same phenomenon, a unique attractive quantum force (the Casimir force) between dielectric or conducting plates can be shown to exist on the basis that absorption and reemission of the ZPF radiation by the plates results in interference and cancellation of certain electromagnetic modes between the plates. The result is an imbalance in the associated ZPF radiation pressures interior and exterior to the plates, hence a net force of attraction between the plates; a close parallel can be drawn between this phenomenon and the familiar concept of radiation pressure [30a]. Again, the ZPF background is inferred from its consequences rather than from direct observation. Indeed, at a deeper level, the various phenomena listed above in (1) through (8) can all be taken as conØrmation and perhaps even as indirect \\observations of the ZPF\" in the sense that their elucidation is most parsimonious in terms of the ZPF interpretation. Inertia and Mach's Principle That matter should have the property of inertia is so fundamental to our conception of physical reality that it is di±cult to imagine how matter could not have such an innate property. How could one have a stable, solid (including liquid and gas in this context) reality without inertia? Put another way, how could ~ F 6 = m~ a ? Newton's equation of motion is a good starting point for discussion. Consider a slight variation of it. Some of the largest scale motions in the Universe involve extremely small accelerations: The v 2 =r acceleration of the Sun around the Milky Way galaxy amounts to a ª 2 £ 10 ° 8 cm s ° 2 (taking v ª 250 km/s and r ª 10 kpc). This is typical of rotational accelerations in outer galactic regions. Accelerations of galaxies within clusters are on a similar scale. Such small accelerations would be extremely di±cult to create and measure in a laboratory, and to that extent, the ~ F = m~ a relation is terra incognita in this regime. Without implying any judgement as to the validity of the proposal, we note that an alternate explanation to the existence of dark matter as a cause of non-Keplerian galactic rotation curves, etc., involves hypothesizing a non-linear ~ F = m~ a relationship for accelerations in this regime [30b]. The point is not to promote this particular hypothesis, merely to point to a conceivable application for a more complex view of inertia. b A discussion of Mach's principle could Øll volumes [31]; it was an important consideration for Einstein in his development of general relativity (GR) [17] [32], and while he initially thought that GR incorporated Mach's principle, a GR-solution for a universe devoid of matter was discovered by Einstein himself [33], and a solution for a rotating universe by Gƒ odel, both demonstrating that Mach's principle was not compatible with GR. Mach argued that all motions must be relative. That being the case, whether one chooses for purposes of analysis a rotating earth or a stationary earth and a counter-rotating universe should not matter. But what would be the origin of centrifugal force in the latter view, deforming the shape of the earth to make it equivalent to the rotating-earth perspective. Mach proposed that the solution lies in the circumstance that the local property of inertia of any material object is caused by the surrounding matter. In this way a rotating universe could conceivably induce an equivalent of centrifugal force in a stationary earth. This view would also be consistent with the idea that it should not make sense to allow a measurable perception of rotation (again from centrifugal or Coriolis forces) if an object were rotating in an empty universe, i.e. rotating with respect to what? In Mach's view such rotation would be an absurdity, and without the presence of other matter available to create inertia the conundrum is avoided. The only long-range force available being gravitation, a Machian inertia must somehow be related to gravity. A preliminary Newtonian model of this was proposed by Sciama [33] in which gravitation arises via the usual scalar potential, © = ° R V ( Ω=r ) dV , while inertia arises via the next higher extension, a vector potential, ~ A = ° (© =c ) ~ v ( t ). It can readily be shown that in this view matter on a cosmological distance scale would predominate in the origin of (local) inertia. No entirely satisfactory formulation of Mach's principle has been developed [34]. Moreover, asymmetries such as those measured by the NASA Cosmic Background Explorer, the mass-asymmetry due to our location in the Milky Way, etc., do not give rise to a measurable asymmetry in inertia, i.e. mass is not a vector quantity. Remarkable upper limits can be placed on this thanks to the Hughes-Drever experiments: ¢ m=m ∑ 10 ° 20 [35] whereas Sciama's approach [33] would predict ¢ m=m ª 10 ° 7 due to the Milky Way. The concept developed by us [HRP] is diÆerent. Inertia does result from something external: not other matter but the ZPF, with the eÆect, at the Ørst level of the analysis at least, being entirely local. In HRP we b Should the ZPF inertia theory result in a prediction of a non-linear inertia in the regime hypothesized by Milgrom, this would of course be a plus for the theory resolving a major astrophysical puzzle | the nature of dark matter | in a quite unexpected way. 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"analyzed the forces on a Planck oscillator when subject to acceleration using the methods of SED. Analytically, we set a point-charge (termed a parton: this could represent a quark or an electron for example) into harmonic motion driven by the random ∞uctuations of the ZPF. These ∞uctuations are perfectly symmetrical in stationary or uniform-motion frames. It was discovered by Davies [36] and by Unruh [37] that acceleration-dependent terms arise in the spectral energy density of the ZPF (cf. equation 3 of HRP). One of these is a pseudo-Planckian component of the ZPF involving an acceleration-temperature (cf. equation 2 of HRP), a very small term under ordinary accelerations. The other term is an acceleration-squared modiØcation of the spectral energy density. In HRP we investigate this term. Following the technique of Einstein and Hopf and the identical conØguration used by Boyer [38] to derive the Davies-Unruh eÆect in the context of SED, we investigated the heretofore unexplored ~ v £ ~ B ZP force that the driven-oscillator would experience in an accelerating frame. The ~ v are the oscillatory motions in a plane due to the electric driving forces, ~ E ZP , of the ZPF. The oscillator is then forced to undergo a uniform acceleration, ~ a , in a direction perpendicular to the plane of oscillation ; the resulting Lorentz force after proper stochastic averaging turns out to be such that <~ v £ ~ B ZP > / ~ a . The Lorentz force resists acceleration in a linear way. We interpret the inertial resistance to acceleration of matter to be this electromagnetic Lorentz force; inertia would thus be electromagnetic in origin . This is, in eÆect, a derivation of ~ F = m~ a from the electrodynamics of ZPF-charged particle interactions. The inertial mass, m i , is then a function of electrodynamic parameters, m i = °π h! 2 c 2 ºc 2 (3) where ° is a damping constant for the oscillations and ! c relates to a characteristic frequency of particle-ZPF interactions. In HRP, ! c was taken to be either a ZPF cutoÆ frequency (the Planck frequency) or a re∞ection of the minimum parton size (the Planck length) which would translate into the same cutoÆ frequency. We speculate that in more reØned future versions of the theory this simple ! c cut-oÆ parameter will actually be replaced by a resonance frequency, ! 0 , and that diÆerences in resonance are factors determining diÆerences in masses of fundamental particles, i.e. the factor of ª 200 diÆerence between an electron and a muon in spite of their identical charge. For a composite particle such as a proton (made of uud quarks) or neutron (made of udd quarks) the inertia-producing interactions would take place with the individual quarks; at very high frequencies quarks would oscillate essentially independently given the nature of the strong interaction, so-called asymptotic freedom (\\At close range, jostling around inside a proton, quarks barely notice one another's presence and act like independent particles.\" [39]); diÆerences in the sign of the charge would only change the phase of the oscillations giving rise to the Lorentz force, not the direction, thus making the eÆect on the individual quarks in a nucleon additive. The HRP analysis has been criticized for using an Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equation of motion as a basis, the argument being that we are \\using Newton's law to derive Newton's law.\" This is not the case since the ALD equation is phenomenologically invoked as an SED resource solely to bring about oscillations in a plane with the Lorentz force arising independently out of the magnetic component of the ZPF in a perpendicularly- accelerating direction. Other justiØed criticisms involve the use of an ideal parton to represent charged matter and general mathematical complexity. All of these problems will be addressed and hopefully swept aside by a new approach in which one considers solely the time evolution of the momentum-∞ux derived from the Poynting vector of the ZPF in a uniformly accelerating coordinate system [40][41]. This new analysis does not concern itself with particle-ZPF interactions other than to assume that ZPF radiation can be scattered by charged matter. Using entirely straightfor- ward Lorentz transformations of the electromagnetic Øeld one can derive the analogous result to HRP: viz, an acceleration-dependent resistance originating in such scattering of radiation. Moreover this analysis has the merit of not only being analytically simpler than HRP, but also of being relativistic, i.e. one can derive the relativistic form of Newton's law in this fashion: F = d P =dø , the well-known four-vector form applicable to particles accelerated to high speeds. Gravitation All experiments and observations to date are consistent with predictions of general relativity. The math- ematical treatment of gravitation as a space-time curvature works well. However if it could be shown that a diÆerent theoretical basis can be made analytically equivalent to space-time curvature, with its prediction of gravitational lensing, black holes, etc. this would reopen the possibility that gravitation is a force. Einstein himself \\did not think that electromagnetism and gravity should remain separate, and spend the later years of his life searching for a theory of `electro-gravity' to complete the work begun by Maxwell\" [39]. The following 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"points are also worth noting: (1) general relativity and quantum physics are at present irreconcilable, therefore something substantive is either wrong or missing in our understanding of one or both; (2) the propagation of gravitational waves is not rigorously consistent with space-time curvature. c If inertial mass, m i , originates in ZPF-charge interactions, then, by the principle of equivalence so must gravitational mass, m g . In this view, gravitation is a force originating in ZPF-charge interactions analogous to the HRP inertia concept. Sakharov [14] was the Ørst to conjecture this interpretation of gravity. If true, gravitation would be uniØed with the other forces: it would be a manifestation of electromagnetism. Although there were some early attempts to link gravity to the ZPF from a quantum Øeld theoretical viewpoint (by Amati, Adler and others, see discussion and references in [67]) as well as within SED [42], the Ørst step in developing Sakharov's conjecture in any detail within the classical context of nonrelativistic SED was the work of PuthoÆ [15]. Gravity is treated as a residuum force in the manner of Casimir or van der Waals forces. Expressed in the most rudimentary way this can be viewed as follows. The ZPF causes a given charged particle to oscillate. Such oscillations give rise to secondary electromagnetic Øelds. An adjacent charged particle will thus experience both the ZPF driving forces causing it to oscillate, and in addition forces due to the secondary Øelds produced by the ZPF-driven oscillations of the Ørst particle. Similarly, the ZPF-driven oscillations of the second particle will cause their own secondary Øelds acting back upon the Ørst particle. The net eÆect is an attractive force between the particles. The sign of the charge does not matter: it only aÆects the phasing of the interactions. Unlike the Coulomb force which, classically viewed, acts directly between charged particles, this interaction is mediated by extremely minute secondary Øelds created by the ZPF-driven oscillations, and so is enormously weaker than the Coulomb force. The ZPF-driven ultrarelativistic oscillations were named Zitterbewegung (\\trembling motion\" in German) by Schrƒ odinger [43]. The PuthoÆ analysis consists of two separate parts. In the Ørst, the energy of the Zitterbewegung motion is equated to gravitational mass, m g (after dividing by c 2 ). This leads to a relationship between m g and electrodynamic parameters that is identical to the HRP inertial mass, m i , apart from a factor of two. This factor of two is discussed in the appendix of HRP, in which it is concluded that the PuthoÆ m g should be reduced by a factor of two, yielding m i = m g precisely. The second part of PuthoÆ's analysis is more controversial. He quantitatively examines the van der Waals force-like interactions between two driven oscillating dipoles and derives an inverse square force of attraction. This part of the analysis has been challenged by Carlip [44], to which PuthoÆ has responded [45], but, since prob- lems remain, this aspect of the ZPF-gravitation concept requires further theoretical development, in particular the implementation of a fully relativistic model. Clearly the ZPF-inertia and the ZPF-gravitation concepts must stand or fall together, given the principle of equivalence. However that being the case, the Sakharov-PuthoÆ gravity concept does legitimately answer the objection that \\the ZPF cannot be a real electromagnetic Øeld since the energy density of this Øeld would be enormous and thereby act as a cosmological constant, §, of enormous proportions that would curve the Universe into something microscopic in size.\" This cannot happen in the Sakharov-PuthoÆ view. This situation is clearly ruled out by the elementary fact that, in this view, the ZPF cannot act upon itself to gravitate. Gravitation is not caused by the mere presence of the ZPF, rather by secondary motions of charged particles driven by the ZPF. In this view it is impossible for the ZPF to give rise to a cosmological constant. d The other side of this argument is of course that as electromagnetic radiation is not made of polarizable entities one might naively no longer expect deviation of light rays by massive bodies. We speculate however that such deviation will be part of a fully relativistic theory that properly takes into account the polarization of the vacuum by passing light rays through the particle-antiparticle Dirac vacuum that should act, in eÆect, as a medium with an index of refraction modiØed in the vicinity of massive objects. This is very much in line c This point is most readably discussed in chap. 3 of Lindley's book [39]. Eddington dismissed the possibility of gravitational waves, declaring that they would have to travel \\at the speed of thought.\" The issue revolves around whether gravitational waves can be made to vanish in a properly chosen coordinate system. The discovery of apparent gravitational energy loss by the Hulse-Taylor pulsar provides indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational waves. Calculations have not yet been done to examine whether the Sakharov-PuthoÆ model would predict gravitational waves, but the coordinate ambiguities of GR should not appear in a ZPF-referenced theory of gravitation. d The possibility of non-gravitating vacuum energy has recently been investigated in quantum cosmology in the framework of the modiØed Born-Oppenheimer approximation by Datta [46]. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"with the original Sakharov concept [14] and with the approach Einstein took in 1911 [16] (with later corrections [17]) involving a speed of light which is dependent on gravitational potential, c (©). Radiation from Accelerated Charges As demonstrated by Boyer [11] and PuthoÆ [18], dipole scattering of the ZPF is an equilibrium process for stationary scatterers. The rederivation of the inertia eÆect from considerations of time evolution of the Poynting vector in a uniformly accelerating coordinate system [40][41] points to similarities with the classical derivation of radiation from uniformly accelerated charges [19]. Based upon this, we speculate that the phenomenon of radiation by accelerating charge may be associated with scattering of ambient ZPF radiation. The isotropic scattering of ZPF radiation by an accelerating particle would appear as creation of emitted radiation from the perspective of a stationary laboratory frame. This same process could also be interpreted as the source of radiation reaction. Thermal radiation of course also originates in accelerated motions in the form of particle oscillations. This may explain why the Davies-Unruh component of the ZPF that appears in accelerated frames and the thermal blackbody radiation have the same spectral form, viz. the Planck function. A major obstacle to such an interpretation of accelerated charge radiation as a ZPF scattering process is that at \\normal frequencies\" the energy density of emission may easily be such that Ω ( ∫ ) ¿ Ω ZPF ( ∫ ), which would vitiate this interpretation unless there were some process capable of rapidly downshifting energy from higher frequencies, where Ω ZPF can be much larger. Stability of the Bohr Atom The snowball that triggered the avalanche of quantum physics started with Bohr's resolution of the problem of radiative collapse of the hydrogen atom. SED analysis of this classical problem has yielded a surprising result that motivates a new look at what has appeared to be a long-resolved issue. Rutherford's discovery of the atomic nucleus in 1911 together with Thomson's previous discovery of the electron in 1897 led to the obvious, but fatally ∞awed, analogy between atomic structure and planetary orbits about the Sun. Electrons, being charged, would radiate away their orbital energy and quickly collapse into the nucleus in this naive analogy. Bohr recognized that Planck's constant, h , could be combined with Rydberg's empirical relationship among the spectral lines of hydrogen to solve the problem of atomic stability by postulating that only discrete transitions are allowed between states whose angular momenta are multiples of h . The ground state of the hydrogen atom would then have angular momentum mvr 0 =π h , or equivalently m! 0 r 2 0 =π h , and would be forbidden to decay below this \\orbit\" by Bohr's Øat. A more complex picture quickly developed from this that substituted wave functions for orbiting point particles, and in that view the orbital angular momentum of the ground state is actually l = 0: the wavefunction is spherically symmetric and has a radial probability distribution whose most probable value is r 0 . (The expectation value is (3 = 2) r 0 .) PuthoÆ [20] improved upon an analysis Ørst carried out by Boyer [11] that demonstrated that while a classically circularly orbiting electron would indeed radiate away energy, if one takes into account the ZPF as a source of energy to be absorbed (again via ~ E ZP -driven oscillations), at the Bohr orbit, r 0 , a condition of balance would take place in absorbed and emitted power, i.e. <P abs > circ = <P rad > circ . In other words, a classically orbiting and radiating electron would pick up as much energy as it loses, and thus be stabilized. This simple analysis has been shown to work not only for the ground state of hydrogen but for the ground state of the harmonic oscillator as well, and is now being explored with regard to ground states in general [47]. It does not apply, however, to excited states. A more sophisticated analysis to examine whether analogous arguments might apply to those circumstances has not been seriously attempted. e The most speculative interpretation of this peculiar result is that it may eventually be shown that matter is stabilized at the atomic level by the ZPF. Presumably the quantum probability distribution would then have to correspond to some kind of time-average of the ∞uctuation-induced perturbations of the electron position. e Extensive but unsuccessful attempts were made by the late Pierre Claverie and collaborators [48], but their work, though mathematically accurate, was based upon what in our opinion was an inadequate physical model for the situation beyond the ground state of hydrogen. We contend that for such analysis to be successful one has to include a more detailed description of the ultrarelativistic Zitterbewegung oscillations of the electron that give rise to the electron spin in the context of what we call \\SED with particle structure\" [12]. A classical non-spinning electron is found to display a nonstationary behaviour that eventually leads to ionization. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The ZPF as a Universal Clock and Spontaneous Emission In the 9th Milne Lecture, delivered at the University of Oxford in 1985, Sir William McCrea concerned himself with the question of whether there is a need for some mechanism that acts as a kind of universal time- keeper, and his conclusion was that that role can only be played by what is called the ZPF [21]. Consider the situation of spontaneous emission. What triggers such an event, or at even more fundamental level, what is it that informs the atom that time is passing and something should occur. All one need do is examine the relations among the Einstein coe±cients to implicate the ZPF in this: A 21 = 2 h∫ 3 c 2 B 21 (4 a ) Ω ∫ = 4 º c I ∫ (4 b ) B 21 I ∫ + A 21 = B 21 ° I ∫ +2 I ZP ∫ ¢ (4 c ) Writing the spontaneous emission coe±cient, A 21 , in this fashion indicates that the spontaneous emission appears to be stimulated emission with the stimulating radiation Øeld being the ZPF. The factor of 2 discrepancy has to do with the intimate relationship between the ZPF and radiation reaction, each of which can be interpreted as contributing equally to the spontaneous emission [49][50]. It is now well known and has been frequently veriØed that spontaneous emission can be altered (both enhanced and reduced) by placing atoms in a cavity [51]. Further discussion of the hypothesized time-keeping function of the ZPF may be found in McCrea's article. The ZPF as a Lorentz Invariant Electromagnetic Component of Dirac's Ether In 1951 Dirac published a short but provocative article entitled: \\Is there an Aether?\" [52] He concluded: \\Thus with the new electrodynamics we are rather forced to have an aether.\" Ether is a loaded term today because it is so widely described as an outmoded, discredited idea. The 19th-century ether was an ill-deØned \\substance\" providing a universal frame of rest and a medium for propagation of light waves. The ZPF is not an ether of this sort. The ZPF is light waves and is therefore not akin to the mysterious substance called ether in the late-19th century. Moreover the ZPF is Lorentz invariant, a crucially important property. Being Lorentz invariant it cannot and does not act as a universal frame of rest for rectilinear motion (which we do not want in physics). However it does provide a universal frame of rest vis-a-vis acceleration. Contrary to a widespread belief, acceleration in general is not relative in general relativistic mechanics; only gravitational acceleration is relative. This point has been made by Rohrlich [24], Rindler and Mishra [53] and Mashhoon [54]. In today's physics one does need a type of \\absolute space\": viz, one that is absolute with respect to acceleration, but not with respect to rest or uniform motion. Mashhoon [54] states: \\Absolute space-time must be invoked to explain inertial accelerations. ::: general relativity renders the acceleration of gravity relative while maintaining the absolute character of any nongravitational acceleration.\" The Lorentz invariant ZPF provides this, and in providing this also gives rise to inertia thus providing a substantive form for Mach's principle. The can be rigorously expressed as follows (Mashhoon, priv. comm.). Newton's equation of motion in special relativity can be written: m d 2 x π dø 2 = F π (5 a ) where these are four-vectors and F π represents a non-gravitational force. In general relativity this becomes m μ d 2 x π dø 2 +° π ∫Ω dx ∫ dø dx Ω dø ∂ = F π : (5 b ) The velocity dx π =dø is a time-like four-vector; the force F π is a space-like four-vector. The two are orthogonal to each other (see Møller [68]). If the space-like four-vector force F π 6 = 0 in any coordinate frame, it will be non-zero in all coordinate frames. The ° π ∫Ω represent the gravitational force and indeed can be set equal to zero by a coordinate transformation. The non-gravitational force F π cannot be transformed away. Thus, turning the arguments around, the absolute nature of non-gravitational acceleration is demonstrated by the manifestation of a force that cannot be transformed away. It is in this sense that there is a need for a special reference frame that is not perceptible on account of uniform motion, but that is perceptible on account of non-gravitational acceleration. We propose that the (Lorentz invariant) ZPF plays this role. 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Cosmic Voids and Cosmic Rays An important consequence of allowing a real ZPF{matter interaction is the prediction of a systematic growth of the translational kinetic energy of relatively isolated, electromagnetically interacting particles. ZPF acceleration can be intuitively understood as follows. A drag force exists for particle motion in any ordinary radiation Øeld, since in the rest frame of the particle the higher the velocity, the greater will be the opposing radiation pressure owing to the Doppler shift, which increases the opposing drag strength of the radiation Øeld in the direction of motion and decreases it in the opposite direction. The ZPF spectrum, however, is Lorentz invariant, which precludes such a radiation drag force that would otherwise limit the velocity. There is thus no dissipative eÆect to compensate the excitations of the ∞uctuating Øeld. A detailed description of the prediction of the ZPF acceleration and of its implementation in astrophysical environments may be found in the review of Rueda [55]. The thermodynamics of this predicted phenomenon is discussed by Cole [56] in some detail. The acceleration eÆect is more pronounced on charged particles than on neutral, polarizable particles. This ZPF-acceleration eÆect is quenched when the ZPF-induced oscillations become relativistic, due to a time-dilation eÆect [57]. This situation occurs for electrons. Since electrons undergo ZPF-induced Zitterbewegung at relativistic speeds, <v zb > º c , they are not signiØcantly accelerated, whereas protons and nuclei, oscillating with <v zb ><< c , can be accelerated. In regions of intergalactic space where densities are extremely low there will be very few particle collisions to damp accelerations. It has therefore been proposed that this may be the origin of the most energetic cosmic rays. The highest energy cosmic ray event detected to date was measured to be 3 £ 10 20 eV [58]. If one assumes the presence of primordial magnetic Øelds in the Universe, this same ZPF-acceleration mechanism will lead to a second phenomenon. Since the mechanism is most eÆective where there is the least matter to damp the accelerations via collisions, large regions of low density will be swept out. Primordial magnetic Øelds will be carried along and wind up being concentrated along with the swept-out matter in regions of higher density which start to aggregate. Eventually the magnetic pressure will build up to the point where it will resist further concentration of the accompanying matter. The end result of this process is proposed to be the formation of the large scale ( d ª 100 Mpc) cosmic sheets and voids discovered within the past decade or so [26][27]. As mentioned above, somewhat diÆerent assumptions on the stochastic processes that lead to acceleration may vitiate this concept [29]. It is too early to decide on this one way of the other. Miscellaneous Considerations Classical electrodynamics takes as a boundary condition that all electromagnetic Øelds originated in some physical process such as the Big Bang or subsequent circumstances such as thermonuclear energy generation in stars, etc. Stochastic electrodynamics assumes that there is, in addition, a uniform, isotropic background elec- tromagnetic zero-point Øeld. It is postulated that the ZPF is just part and parcel of the Universe. Presumably it originated together with the rest of the Universe. This same question can be phrased in a more rigorous way in terms of boundary conditions on Maxwell's equations as discussed by Boyer [11]. The ∫ 3 ZPF spectrum is the unique spectrum that remains invariant under an adiabatic compression or expansion of a cavity [11][59] thus one may surmise that it should not change as the Universe expands. As to the origin of Planck's constant, h , the ZPF as a real electromagnetic Øeld is completely deØned by two properties. First, it must have Lorentz-invariant averaged statistical properties, e.g. the energy density spectrum: This uniquely deØnes the spectral shape as a ∫ 3 spectrum. This leaves only the absolute value to be determined, i.e. having the energy distribution deØned leaves only the energy density. The energy density is measurable in various ways, for example from the macroscopic Casimir force (poorly measured so far in practice) or from the Lamb shift. The constant that results is Planck's constant, h . In other words, in the SED perspective, h is an empirically determinable scale-factor for the strength of the ZPF. It is no coincidence that this same constant is the fundamental one in quantum physics: In the SED view, the perturbations caused by the ZPF are the source of quantum indeterminacy. That is why the Heisenberg uncertainly relation contains π h , because the ZPF ∞uctuations provide the irreducible stochastic noise that are conventionally interpreted as innate uncertainty. It is also of interest to consider the size of the electron in this context. As discussed in the monograph by MacGregor [60], The Enigmatic Electron , there are arguably seven \\correct values\" of the electron radius, ranging from the Compton radius, R C =3 : 86 £ 10 ° 11 cm, to the \\real\" radius of the electric charge measured by high energy scattering experiments, R e ø 10 ° 16 cm, and for all one knows R e could be truly point-like. The smearing out of the electron charge by the ZPF involves the two phenomena of vacuum polarization and Zitterbewegung . 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Both of these together yield a radius equal to the Compton radius. Thus one defensible interpretation is that the electron really is a point-like entity, smeared out to its quantum dimensions by the ZPF ∞uctuations. In the ZPF inertia concept the electron should be massless at the level of the Zitterbewegung motions; only accelerations of the already oscillating electron give rise to inertia. If one thus sets the Zitterbewegung velocity to c , the radius that results from the Heisenberg relation is R C , again consistent with the view of an electron as an oscillating point charge. It was long-ago suggested by Huang [43] and Weisskopf [61] that the spin of the electron could follow from Zitterbewegung , a concept that has received some support from recent work by Rueda [12]. An important point to make is that at the present time the ZPF theory deals only with photons, not the W + ,W ° and Z 0 massive bosons mediating the weak interaction, nor the gluons of the strong interaction. This is certainly a deØciency which a generalization of the ZPF concept in the direction of a uniØed Øeld embodying the electromagnetic, weak and strong Øelds should be able to remedy. Also the question of how quantum non- locality could be reconciled with a purely SED explanation of quantum phenomena has barely begun to be addressed (cf. [62] and references therein). Tests and Applications These radical new concepts open the door in principle to (1) modiØcation of inertia and gravity and (2) extraction of energy from the ZPF. However even if these possibilities do materialize, the eÆects may be inØnitesimally minute. Take for example the credible theoretical quantum electrodynamics prediction that between two conducting (Casimir-type) plates the speed of light perpendicular to the plates should be greater than c [63]. This appears to be a correct prediction, but the most optimistic circumstances for plate separation of 100 ∫ A would yield an excess of only ¢ c º 10 ° 24 c . In the views presented herein inertial mass should also change under such circumstances. Indeed the two eÆects are not unrelated. If one assumes that the E = mc 2 relationship would still hold exactly, m i would also change, decreasing by 2¢ c=c . We speculate that a more robust possibility would result from understanding the origin of ° and ! 0 (assuming a resonance in place of a cutoÆ) determining m i . A thought experiment by Forward [64] involving the Casimir force to do work nicely demonstrated the formal possibility of extracting energy from the ZPF. The thermodynamics of energy extraction from the ZPF has now been studied by Cole and PuthoÆ [65] and there appears to be no obvious impossibility. The ZPF is not a thermal reservoir, and so, in spite of the \\zero-point\" name, it does not amount to attempts to extract usable thermal energy from a T = 0 reservoir. The mysterious phenomenon of sonoluminescence has been suggested to originate in ZPF-related energy [66]. The possibility of an Einstein-Hopf acceleration of particles discussed above would be an example of energy extraction. Whether this could be utilized in some practical way is entirely unknown, but it does appear that this could serve as a test. Sealed cyrogenically cooled vacuum traps have succeeded in conØning large numbers of antiprotons. The proposal of Rueda, Haisch and Cole [26] suggests that individual antiprotons should undergo accelerations on the order of 1 keV s ° 1 in a totally collision-free trap of this sort. Injecting antiprotons into such a trap should then result in ZPF acceleration of these particles which would then readily be detectible via annihilation signatures upon striking the walls of the trap. This would constitute extraction of energy from the ZPF, and indeed the acceleration of certain high-energy cosmic rays may be a naturally occurring process of such energy extraction [29]. Unfortunately the gap between a present-day laboratory high-vacuum density (10 8 cm ° 3 ) and the intergalactic density (10 ° 6 cm ° 3 ) is formidable. The views presented herein involve a radical change in perspective. It is our hope that this article will elicit the interest of other researchers to investigate these possibilities so that we may soon know whether the exciting prospects implicit in this approach are real or illusory.
