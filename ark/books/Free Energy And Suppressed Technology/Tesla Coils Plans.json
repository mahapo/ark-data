[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Altair - Nikola Tesla and How to Make a Tesla Coil Nikola Tesla And His Celebrated Tesla Coil Nikola Tesla, Serbian-American inventor, remains shrouded in controversy and mystery sixty years after his death. Establishment historians try to sweep Tesla under the rug. Cult followers believe Tesla was centuries ahead of today's technology, inventing antimatter, antigravity, free energy, and that Tesla and his followers left Earth to live on another planet. Coilers just love to design and build versions of the famous Tesla Coil. By any measure Tesla was eccentric and brilliant, and his patents founded empires of industry and technology. Yet other men rode to fame and fortune on Teslas inventions. Teslas AC generators and motors power the wheels of industry, while the name of Tesla was all but forgotten. Tesla died in poverty in a New York hotel in January 1943, his papers were quickly siezed by the FBI. For years after the death of Tesla, lawsuits raged over Tesla patents. Out of only eleven patent suits ever heard by the US Supreme Court in its history before 1960, two were suits over tesla inventions, and the Court found that Tesla was indeed the inventor of Polyphase AC, and of practical Radio Frequency Transmission. Tesla's Avengers John Wagner, school teacher, mobilized his third grade classes to raise thousands of dollars to create this commemorative bronze bust of Tesla. Wagner accuses the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History of presenting \"a deliberate assault on factual history\" and is crusading to set the record straight. Read how Tesla was Erased at the Smithsonian and get a kewul Tesla Tshirt while helping the class raise funds for more busts like this one at Yale University. \"In a single burst of invention he created the polyphase alternating current system of motors and generators that powers our world. He gave us every essential of radio, and laid the foundation for much of today’s technology.\" -- Epitath on bronze bust of Tesla, refused by the Smithsonian, now displayed at Yale University. Tesla Coiling While Teslas polyphase AC system spans the world today, a different invention, the Tesla Coil, never saw commercial use. The Tesla Coil however is the most awe inspiring electrical device, transforming ordinary power into high frequencies at tremendous voltages. During his brief peropd of poularity Tesla with his coil created spectacular displays of live electricity, such as the 1893 Worlds Fair in Chicago. Tesla coils are still individually hand made by intrepid Coilers following in Teslas footsteps. I discovered the Tesla Coil in 1978 while reading a 19th century article by Tesla in a cracked, leather and wood bound volume from an obscure corner at Georgia Tech. Back in my dormitory, I began building a Tesla Coil. Several nights later, I powered up the coil. My terrified roomate fled in panic. The Tesla Coil was delightfully awe inspiring, with its shattering roar and streamers of purple fire writhing in the air. I was in love. http://www.altair.org/tesla.htm (1 of 7) [10/02/03 10:17:09 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Altair - Nikola Tesla and How to Make a Tesla Coil Call Me Sparky !

The prototype withstands 33kV AC in spark gap duty. i pulled out about 5\" by 18\" strip, i rolled it around the cup at about 1\" from the top holding the overlap of about 1\" tightly, then tearing off the excess. holding the seam i started rubbing the foil tightly around the cup with the other hand, then folding it under the cup and pressing flat. then i put the cup inside another cup and putting my hand inside i pressed, squeezed, pushed, twisted, and rubbed the two cups together. when i pulled the cups apart i was surprised at how flat and form fitting the foil had become. i then rubbed the foil even smoother with a sharpie marker, burnishing the bottom folds tightly against the cup. i took the foil cup and pushed it inside the other cup and did the rub, twist, push routine again then pulled them apart one more time, i took the torn off piece and folded it over twice to make the contact strip, i slid it under the foil about 1\" then put the cups back together. this made one cell.

It is still Quick and Hawg cheap, but it includes a simple method of continuously and simultaneously varying the gap spacing in an (almost) uniform manner. Multiple spark gaps are used to improve 'quenching' which is the gaps' ability to stop conducting after it has delivered the proper amount of charge. In high power Tesla coils, the RF energy in the primary may cause the gap to continue conducting RF after the capacitor is discharged, which depletes the energy from the primary-secondary system. Multiple gaps are optimized by three main parameters: number of gaps, gap spacing, and airflow. Airflow is optimized by a blower, number of gaps is optimized by a selectable tap in a chain of gaps. In this version, the spacings are also adjustible by bowing a flexible substrate. SuckerGap The SuckerGap is an idea from. It is a static gap using two hollow tubular electrodes with air being sucked into the electrodes. The air promotes good quenching and cools the gap. This gap is sucked by a ShopVac. The blower of the ShopVac is mounted onto a plastic bucket which has a two-horned PVC manifold. The electrodes are copper pipe fittings at the ends of the manifold facing each other. Cone Primary Coil Primary coils spirally wound in the shape of an inverted cone allow the coupling to be adjusted by raising or lowering the secondary. This inverted conical spiral primary uses coil supports cut from pegboard to form notches for the wire to be laid into. I use pegboard with 1/4 in holes which fits #6 copper ground wire. Later, I used 3/4 inch copper tubing on the same coil form. Extending MOT Stacks Many experimenters stack MOTs (Microwave Oven Transformers) with their primaries in parallel and secondaries in series to get several kV. Usually with more than 4 MOTs in series, the secondary to core insulation begins to fail. Those who have PLENTY of MOTs might try this hookup to extend their MOT stack farther before insulation failure. This connection allows four MOTs to be stacked with only a 2x overstress of the insulation, even in one end of the stack is grounded. Two such stacks oppositely phased will give eight MOTs in series with a grounded center tap with only 2x overstress. This connection allows four MOTs to be stacked with NO overstress of the insulation.

In his own words: (Our 1,000 KV Tesla coil) was a pulsed device with a pulse input power of about 6.5 MW. ( 13 Kv @ 500 A. ) Just the kind of toy you'd expect a teenager to build. (The average was about 1 KW). (We also built a \"Jacob's ladder that was 10 feet high with a 2 foot gap...but that was one of our low voltage gadgets...160 KV). No pix of it. How big a spark are these guys after ? ( Mine did about six feet ! ...Limited by distance to grounded objects. ) Heres more from Kip : The tesla coil that I and Vic made used a rug core for the coil form. I still have some of the wire we used...I think it's #26. My memory is a little flaky, but I believe it was about 6 feet long and 6 in (more or less) diameter. The primary was about 2 feet in diameter. We operated with one end grounded and the freq was about 135 KHz. It used a tungsten rotary spark gap (homemade) and had a 13.5 KVDC , 500 watt power source. The arc was limited by the 6 foot distance to ground. I have a picture...somewhere. If I can find it, I'll send you a copy. I think Vic lost it during a move a few years ago. The cap was a very high voltage indeed WWII surplus unit. Kip Kip supplied the info to draw a schematic of Vic and Kip's unusual Tesla Coil. Note the high voltage supply is DC and the coil runs at a low rate of about 10 BPS. The 3B24 rectifiers and transformer required no RFI protection. Please email Kip and bug him to dig up his old TC photo for this page. Bert Behlow made an unusual secondary coil which was immersed in mineral oil. This secondary had LOTS of turns of very fine wire. A valiant effort, but fell short of our grand expectations. Bert, if you're out there somewhere, it would be really good to hear from you. I have collected materials for a secondary coil about 60\" tall and 9\" in diameter. Would like to resonate it at 184.32 KHz so it could double as an output stage for Lowfer beacon YWK.

A Serbian immigrant, he arrived in America a pauper, earned fame and fortune as an eccentric but flambouyant genius, and died in poverty. Nikola Tesla's patents still today are the core of our electrical power distribution and use. Royalties from his many inventions founded empires of industry and technology for those shrewd enough to have obtained them cheaply, such as Morgan, Westinghouse and Edison. The celebrated Tesla Coil has found little commercial use, but is still the hands down favorite for producing awesome and beautiful electrical displays. Grote Reber Grote Reber (1911-2???) a ham radio operator and engineer who founded the science of Radio Astronomy in his spare time. In 1937 he built a 31 ft parabolic dish antenna with a 20 ft focal length in his backyard in Wheaton, Illinois. With his third homemade radio receiver, he successfully recorded extraterrestrial signals at 160 MHz in 1938. Reber worked long into the night when interference was reduced. By aiming his dish in declination and using the rotation of the planet earth, Reber had completed the first radio map of the sky by 1943, clearly showing not only our own galactic core, but discovering new sources in Cygnus and Cassiopeia. When a delegation of distinguished scientists came to verify his accomplishment, he had to delay them because it was laundry day and his dish antenna was supporting one end of Mrs Reber's clothesline. When the movie Contact was filmed at the VLA Radio Astronomy Observatory, ham operators there contacted Reber, by then very aged but continuing research and living in Tasmania. Reber permitted his ham radio callsign to be used by Jodie Foster in the movie. James Clerk Maxwell James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) received much of his formal http://www.altair.org/lexicon.htm (1 of 4) [10/02/03 10:17:11 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Lexicon of Electromagnetic Terms technical education in London, but his heart continually drew him to poetry, and to his family home in the hills of Scotland. Maxwell was a child prodigy; his first paper, on the mathematics of arbitrary curved shapes in rolling contact, was published when he was sixteen years old. More mathematical treatises on an astonishing variety of subjects followed. Although famous for his equations of electromagnetics, they comprised a small part of his life works. His papers include the mathematics of human perception of colors, kinetic theory of gasses, the dynamics of a spinning top, thoeries of soap bubbles, and others. During his career, he would repeatedly discover scientists and experimenters wrestling with knotty theoretical problems, whereupon he would step in and set the math right, before moving on to some other problem which drew his interest. As astronomers argued over the physical composition of the newly discovered rings of Saturn, Maxwell deduced the answer by purely mathematical reasoning; nearly a hundred years after his death NASA space probes proved him right. Classical Physics Classical Physics is the physics up to the Thoery of Relativity. If you dont know what kind of physics you studied, it was classical physics. John Wheeler taught a freshman college physics course that started with the Theory of Relativity and commenced to describe the whole of classical physics as a condition of relativity. His wild approach was quickly suppressed. Continuity conditions Continuity conditions say that flux density is proportional to field strength. The constants of this proportionality are the permitivity (for electric force) and permeability (for magnetic force). These two constants represent the elasticity of spacetime. From these two numbers we get the impedance and velocity of a wave in space. The impedance is 377 ohms, the velocity is 186000 miles/second. Scot Q: Why did God create whiskey ?

If we look into matter, we find it composed of molecules and atoms, which in turn are composed of protons, neutrons and electrons. Virtually everything our senses perceive are elaborate structures of protons, neutrons and electrons and the electromagnetic fields that bind them. These particles are quite small and have powerful electric and magnetic charges. Picture our solar system seen in the night sky; the planets are very small compared to the vast distances separating them. The structure of the solar system is held together by gravity as the structure of the atom is held together by electromagnetic forces.

Unfortunately, neither of the Wright brothers lived long enough to know that their own country officially acknowledged their great accomplishment.

Use tweezers to handle superconductors, magnets, or other small, cold objects. Plastic tweezers are useful but should be tested for embrittlement (see last caution) before use in classroom. Wear insulating gloves when handling liquid nitrogen or large, cold objects. Use liquid nitrogen only in well ventilated places. Do not allow any liquid nitrogen to touch any part of your body. Item in contact with liquid nitrogen becomes Extremely Cold. Do not touch any item that has been immersed in liquid nitrogen until it has warmed to room temperature. Do not store liquid nitrogen in any container with a tight fitting lid. A tightly sealed container will build up pressure as the liquid boils and may EXPLODE after a short time. Many substances become brittle and may shatter when cold, sending pieces of the material flying. Avoid common glass and large, solid plastics.

Polychlorinated Biphenyls PCB oils have excellent dielectric properties, stability and are non-flammable and were used in manufacture of certain high voltage transformers, capacitors and other devices. PCBs were developed in the late 1940s and since the mid 1970s manufacturers have phased them out due to toxicity. Newer oil filled High Voltage components will be labeled PCB-free. PCB oils are TOXIC NASTY BAD STUFF for living beings. If you suspect an old component uses PCB oils, you can call the EPA or hire a test lab, or CAREFULLY do the following three simple tests for PCBs : 1 A droplet held in a flame on a piece of nichrome etc. will give a green color signalling the presence of chlorine. 2 PCB oils are much heavier than mineral oils. Specific gravity of PCBs is about 1.5, and they will sink in water. 3 PCB-based transformer oils have a pronounced sweet-solvent odor, like benzene. Mineral oils lack the strong odor, will float in water, and burn yellow. If PCBs are present, the component, the oil, and anything they have touched should be considered TOXIC.

The first Hawg project, popularized by the illustrious Kip, is an 11 dB gain 1250 MHz antenna made from hardware cloth, or here in Georgia, \"Hawg Fence Wire\" In keeping with Hawg tradition, here is an investigation of high voltage capacitor banks suitable for use in small Tesla Coils. The high voltage dielectric of Hawg Capacitors are plastic soda pop bottles. A capacitor is two conductors separated by an insulator (dielectric). In the Hawg capacitor, a plastic bottle separates two conductive salt solutions. Salt water capacitors are common among novice Tesla Coilers, although most experienced hands graduate to surplus capacitors or more sophisticated homegrown capacitors. The main problem with plastic soda bottles is they cannot withstand the electrical stress, and the dielectric will soon puncture, short- circuit, leak, etc. The Dielectric : The operating life of a capacitor is roughly inversely proportional to the 5th power of the applied voltage, and is halved for every 10 C temperature rise. Dielectric in thin layers will stand more voltage per mil than in thicker layers. Plastic soda pop bottles are usually made of Polyethylene Terpthalate ( PET or Mylar ) with a wall thickness of 0.010 +- 0.0005 inches. \"Reference Data for Radio Engineers, 4th Edition\" (1957) list of Material Properties : Polyethylene DE-3401 with 0.1% antioxidant additive : Freq K TAN K 60 Hz 2.26 <.0002 http://www.altair.org/projects/hawgcaptheo.htm (1 of 3) [10/02/03 10:18:46 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Tesla Coil Hawg Capacitor 1 kHz 2.26 <.0002 1 MHz 2.26 <.0002 100 MHz 2.26 <.0002 3 GHz 2.26 0.00031 25 GHz 2.26 0.0006 Dielectric Strength (0.033\") is 1200 V/mil at 25C. Softening point is 95 - 105 C Moisture absorption 0.03% Factors that promote failure of the dielectric are : concentration of E-field at sharp corners, corona discharge (bewaare of corona in trapped bubbles) and heating. PET bottles are blown into molds which 'orients' the molecules and improves the dielectric strength. Heating will cause the plastic to shrink and molecularly disorient, leading to dielectric rupture. The Conductors : A common technique using bottles is to wrap the outside with foil and put a condusctive liquid inside. With a foil wrapping, my 2 liter bottle measured 2.4 nF, I fully expected to get one or two nF more with electrolyte replacing the outer foil, but to my surprise the capacitance increased to 8.5 nF !! By putting liquid inside and out, a smooth, close contact is made, increasing capacitance, reducing field concentrations and corona. Corona is BAD NEWS for capacitors. I dont know a lot about electrolyte conductivity, but ion concentration, ion mobility and valence will be important. However I suspect in this case the major portion of resistance is contact resistance. I normally use table salt (sodium chloride) and/or Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate). Jim Lux suggests copper sulfate for compatibility with copper electrodes. Watch out for generation of dangerous chemicals, for instance sodium chloride may decompose into chlorine. Floating a layer of oil over the top of the liquid, both inside and out, reduces corona discharge at the edges. http://www.altair.org/projects/hawgcaptheo.htm (2 of 3) [10/02/03 10:18:46 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Tesla Coil Hawg Capacitor Experiments THE HAWG CAPACITOR EXPERIMENTS TEST FIXTURE A: the Test Article is connected across a 450VA, 15 kV neon sign transformer (NST) in parallel with a 2cm fixed spark gap.

A dead ant was allowed to remain in the electrolyte. #14 Cu wire was immersed in the interior and exterior electrolyte. TEST 1 : When the PSWC was clip leaded across the gap, the arc became a very loud and satisfying roar. The internal electrolyte level was about 2 in above the external level, and streamers were observed over the exterior of the dielectric in a band between the inner and outer electrolyte levels. Especially bright discharges were seen on the dielectric close to the outer electrode wire, and the test was terminated. TEST 2 : Extra dielectric was placed as a spacer between the outer electrode and the bottle dielectric, and high voltage was reapplied. Corona and surface streamers were seen in the band previously mentioned. After about one minute, the PSWC shorted out very suddenly. A small dielectric puncture was found several inch below the surface, under a fragment of the bottle label. TEST 3 : Another PSWC was prepared with a well- stripped 2l coke bottle. This failed after about 3 minutes at the inner (upper) electrolyte level by arcing thru to the outer electrode wire. Conclusions : Everybody is right. Polyethylene Terpthalate is a great dielectric. Soda pop bottle PSWCs are vulnerable to dielectric rupture, puncture and leak.

Equalize inner and outer electrolyte levels. Use an oil layer above the electrolyte. Cleanliness is next to Godliness and Saint Tesla, get bottles 'squeaky clean' before use. Keep electrodes clear of dielectric to allow current density to diffuse thru electrolyte. Symmetric current diffusion and smooth, clean dielectric seem to be essential. No failures were attributed to the dead ant, although bits of label and glue were suspected in several failures. TEST ARTICLE : Outer electrode and vessel was a cheap K-mart stainless steel stock pot, the bottom of which was lined with disk cut from plastic ceiling light grille. The soda bottle was thoroughly stripped and all label adhesive removed with methanol. The inner electrolyte started out as carbonic acid, magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride. The outer electrolyte was magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride in a solution of water and fermented Gatorade. The inner electrode was 10 inch of 1/2 in copper pipe suspended in the bottle neck by a copper tee. The dead ant from last night was retired from duty. Electrolyte levels were equalized within a mm, and no oil layer was added. TEST 4 : The test article was connected in parallel with a 450 VA, 15,000 Volt NST bridged by a 2 cm static arc gap. During the test, intermittent streamers were observed on the upper dielectric, which mostly appeared internal. Some condensation was also observed on the internal surface. After several minutes the streamers subsided although condensation remained. The plastic bottle dielectric failed at about t+30 min, with a small rupture at the electrolyte surface.

TEST ARTICLE : Same as test 4, but with 5mm mineral oil film on electrolyte surface inside and outside dielectric. TEST 5 : The test article with oil layer was tested for 30 seconds. A slight foam of gas bubbles was generated around the dielectric at or near the surface. A milky cloud began spreading in the oil layer or interface which appeared to be composed of tiny gas bubbles.

A phenomenon that has surprised many. Ruby mica has such a high dielectric strength partly because it is composed of many very uniform very thin layers stuck together. I would consider one hour as the minimum acceptable life of a disposable dielectric capacitor. I would still like to compare notes with any other folks who attempt to use plastic soda bottle SWCs, the more experience i can gather from others, the further/quicker I can progress. Rules of thumb: dielectric life goes as 1/e^5 with voltage and 1/2 with each 10 degree temperature rise. Any comment ? From: Kip Turner[SMTP:kip@mindspring.com] Your extrapolation is interesting but may not work. You have to look at the BIG picture. Capacitors are usually tested at twice working voltage to weed out obvious defects. In going to very high voltages, you may excite other failure modes, such as arcing other than through the dielectric. Also, using your 6x example, you will get 36 times the normal internal heating, and most dielectrics are poor thermal conductors. Yes, but I control the construction to eliminate other modes. Your point about heat is well taken. I have made PET (mylar film) capacitors for AC operation at 1 KVA per cubic inch. This produces about 10 watts of heat per cubic inch and the units would increase in temperature at a rate of several degrees C per second. The units were rated for 30 seconds on-time per 10 minutes and required a internal cooling arrangement to even survive that. I consider min acceptable life = 1 hour.

Since you are operating at a higher frequency and very high fields, I would expect a much more rapid rise to the failure point (150-200 C). It is possible that, even with a cooling liquid for electrodes, the interior of the PET is overheating. The plastics are not very good thermal conductors. My observations above point to localized heating at the liquid surface. Oil layer may/not help. You might want to look it up, and calculate what happens to the internal temperature, assuming that the heat input is uniform and about 1 % of the reactive power in the capacitor. You should be able to integrate that and estimate the hot spot maximum temperature. You should keep PET well below 150 C, to avoid damage that weakens it and drastically increases the loss. You might want to check the \"bottle\" to be sure it does have the lower loss. It may not be as good as the film...which you can buy easily as \"drafting mylar\". Mylar (PET) is non-linear with voltage. It's resistance has a significant field intensity related effect, with the resistivity dropping at high voltages. This can help, in some cases, but you are above the fields which give long life. Remember that there are several other causes for failure. Not just the voltage. You may reach gradients which produce field emission, especially at discontinuities. Hey, I don't care if you pass along my \"OPINIONS\". Or you can take the credit ( or blame ) if you want to ! Kip I'm probably running 2 to 3 kV per mil, but maybe this is still possible. So far I have blowed up two PSWCs, the first lasted 10 sec the second one survived 3 min.

According to you, if I take a PET plastic dielectric capacitor with a rated life of 100,000 hours to 3x its design voltage, it should survive 400 hours. At six times over voltage, it should survive 10 hours. Corona problems are still my main concern, although none of the Tesla List responses specifically mentioned corona in their PSWC attempts. Since the Tesla list is generally interested in high voltage caps and especially home grown ones, I'm forwarding your experience to the Tesla list server unless someone objects. Will ps : Mike Foster tells me the PET in soda bottles is molecularly oriented as a byproduct of the blowing process. My CRC handbook does not list the real part of the vector permittivity nor the dielectric strength. Yes, I know about teflon, but unfortunately have no source of cheap Teflon soda bottles ;-) From: Kip Turner[SMTP:kip@mindspring.com] As mentioned by one of your respondents, Mylar dielectric film is grain oriented PET. I don't know if the soda pop bottles are or not. The DF (Dissipation Factor) is about 1 % at low frequencies(the dielectric stuff). If heated above about 150 C, it will un-orient and the DF (DF= watts/VA... like power factor) will increase to 3 or 4 %. I never checked it at RF frequencies. Obviously, it's rather lossy for RF use. Teflon as a DF of about 0.01%...a factor of 100 lower. I highly recommend the oil floating on the electrolyte, to reduce corona which is very damaging to the dielectric. You may have a higher than average field at the edge of the electrolyte. Life on a dielectric varies approximately as 1/(E^5) where E is the field intensity in the dielectric.

Hope this helps you to estimate life. Remember...corona in a capacitor is a NO-NO ! Kip Well, if 6u PET holds 600v then 9 mil PET should hold 900 kV, no? I should be able to get a pop bottle to stand up to a 15 kV Tesla coil, even with 15 kV of LF riding ont he 15 kV of 60 Hz. I notice the CRC handbook lists the dielectric constant of PET the same value for all three frequencies in their table. Thats gotta be a good sign for low dissipation. I dont have a microwave oven for dielectric loss testing right now. Will That does not confirm my experiences with PET. I have been able to get 6 micron PET coated with 0.025 micron aluminum to operate at 600 VDC, but that is a \"self healing thickness of aluminum. ( It will evaporate around a fault ).

Mike you were right about my skill at the subtle art of bottle-foiling ! From: Payne, Will E [SMTP:will.e.payne@lmco.com] My recent query on use of plastic soda pop bottles for SW caps reaped two sets of responses. Some folks warned me about their bad experiences with soda pop bottle SW caps, which perforate, arc thru and dribble SW on the floor. However, Mike Foster is a fount of useful knowledge on sucessful use of PET dielectric bottles at very high DC voltages. From: Michael Foster[SMTP:michael.foster@mailexcite.com] If your 2-liter Coke bottle only had a capacitance of a little over 2nf, then the bottle walls must be thicker than the mineral water bottles, or you are not as good as I am at applying the foil. Pop bottles have to withstand 6 atmospheres of pressure because of the carbonation, so they might be thicker than mineral water bottles. Why don't you try immersing the pop bottle in a larger container of salt water and see the both made of the same stuff, polyethylene terphthalate. PET has a dielectric constant of about 3.2. Both the dielectric constant and the dielectric strength vary a bit with the average molecular weight of the polymer and with the stress of molding, or how far the plastic is stretched when it is blown into the mold. Similar effects are taken into consideration when rating commercial metallized polyester caps as the film used is the same material as the pop bottles. In this case, the film is \"biaxially oriented\" meaning that it is stretched in two directions while it is hot. This increases both the mechanical and dielectric strength, which are really the same thing. I find that it is important to have the salt water at near saturation to work really well. In fact, one of my favorite tech- niques is to saturate the solution with both salt and http://www.altair.org/projects/hawgcapemail.htm (5 of 6) [10/02/03 10:18:49 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Tesla Coil Reference Data for Design and Experiment Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate.) Just to see what would happen, I made a salt water cap which was two cells separated by PET film only .00048 inch thick (12 microns.) And no, that's not an extra zero. Anyway, I charged this up to 25kv repeatedly with no trouble at all. The reason I bring up all this stuff about the stress and orientation of PET, is that if you heat up a spot on this plastic, it tends shrink there and get a little thicker. I just thought that with the addition of water cooling on both sides of the polyester, this might constitute a \"self-healing\" dielectric. I guess I'm just going to finally break down and build a coil myself to test it out. And by the way, I will cut apart some 2-liter Coke bottles and measure the wall thickness with a micrometer, which is how I know the thickness of the mineral water bottles.

Veteran coilers can delete this now to save time! :^) 1. Why do we use high primary circuit voltages? And why the spark gap in the primary circuit? Capacitor-discharge Tesla Coils use a high voltage transformer to charge up (temporarily store energy in) the primary (tank) capacitor (Cp). Once the voltage on the capacitor rises to a sufficient level to ionize the main spark gap (Vgap), the gap \"fires\", and acting as a switch, electrically closes the loop between the primary winding (Lp) and charged tank capacitor. The gap's firing causes the primary LC circuit to oscillate, or \"ring\", much like a bell getting struck by a hammer, creating an oscillating electromagnetic field around the primary. The amount of energy available to \"ring\" the primary system is a function of the tank capacitance and voltage at the time the gap fired, and is typically called the \"bang\" size. Bang size represents the maximum amount of primary tank cap energy that's available for transfer to the secondary each time the gap initially fires. Mathematically, the bang size will be Ep = 0.5*Cp*(Vgap*Vgap) in Joules. Doubling the tank cap size doubles the bang size... BUT, doubling the main gap breakdown voltage QUADRUPLES the bang size. This is one reason why higher power systems tend to use higher operating/gap breakdown voltages and larger value tank caps. Now, only a relatively small portion of the primary's electromagnetic field, typically 10-25%, interacts with the secondary. This fraction, called the coupling coefficient (k), is purely a function of the geometries and relative placement of the primary and secondary windings. The secondary and top terminal also form an LC circuit, made up of the secondary inductance (Ls), the self-capacitance of the secondary to ground (Cs), plus the effective capacitance of any top terminal we've added (Ct). The magnetic coupling betwwen the primary and secondary permit us to transfer energy between the two LC systems. A 2-coil Tesla Coil is properly tuned when the primary's ringing frequency is made equal to that of the secondary, forming a dual-tuned resonant transformer. This condition can be expressed mathematically as Lp*Cp = Ls*(Cs+Ct), and the natural ringing frequency Fo of each is approximately 1/(2*Pi*Sqrt(LpCp)). 2. Where does the high voltage output come from?? Here's where it gets a bit more complex... When the main gap fires, the energy initially stored in the ringing primary LC circuit begins to electromagnetically couple into the secondary LC circuit, causing it to \"ring\". However, any energy which transfers to the secondary MUST reduce the amount of energy that remains in the primary, since Tesla Coils do NOT violate Conservation of Energy, and all we've got to play with is the initial \"bang\" energy stored in the primary tank cap at the instant the gap fired. Because of the relatively loose coupling between the primary and secondary, it takes time for the primary's energy to fully transfer to the secondary. Called the secondary \"ring-up\" time, it is typically 2-4 cycles at Fo - the greater the coupling corefficient (k), the less time it takes. During this transfer time, we're also losing energy to gap resistance, skin effect, and other losses in the system, and the maximum http://www.altair.org/projects/TCBasics.txt (1 of 3) [10/02/03 10:19:10 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"http://www.altair.org/projects/TCBasics.txt energy that we can practically transfer to the secondary is typically no more than 60-85% of the initial bang size. At some point near the completion of the secondary's \"ring-up\", we'll ideally get \"breakout\" of the top terminal, forming one or more streamer discharges. Once this occurs, we'll typically begin losing significant energy to the streamers (a very desirable loss!). Once we've transferred all the available energy from the primary to the secondary, ALL the system's energy resides in the secondary's LC system. If we now \"open up\" the primary gap (called first notch quenching), we will prevent any of this energy from coming back into the primary LC circuit, and the secondary's remaining energy will hopefully dissipate into the streamers as it \"rings down\". However, if we are not successful in quenching the main gap, it reignites, and much of the secondary's energy then transfers back to the primary until all the remaining system energy again resides in the primary LC circuit. This energy interchange process can repeat (often many times) until the gap finally does quench. Irrespective of when we quench, ALL the original bang energy will eventually be be dissipated, and the gap extinguished. The HV source then begins recharging the tank cap for the next bang. One important thing to remember: In a disruptive system, there is never any energy \"carried over\" from one bang to the next; secondary energy does NOT build up from one bang to the next. The high output voltage that you see is actually due to the comparatively small capacitance in the secondary LC circuit compared to the primary and the Conservation of Energy. If there were no system losses, ALL of the bang energy would be transferred to the secondary. In practice, a well-constructed coil may deliver over 85% of this energy to the secondary. For now, let's call this fraction the energy transfer efficiency, or X. Let's assume that we transfer X% of the primary bang energy to the secondary. The maximum energy in the secondary, and thus the maximum output voltage, will be directly limited to X*Ep. And we can thus find Vout as a function of the othter variables: Let Ep = Initial Primary Bang Energy = .5Cp*Vgap^2) Let Es = Energy transferred to the Secondary = 0.5*(Cp+Ct)*(Vout^2) And, let's assume Es = X*Ep. Solving for Vout: Vout = Vgap*SQRT(X*Cp/(Cs+Ct)) In typical 2-coil systems, Vout will be in the range of 10-30 times Vgap. Your mileage may vary! Notice that the turns ratio between the primary and secondary windings has no direct bearing on Vout! However, it CAN be shown that there is a relationship between the relative primary and secondary coil inductances: Vout = Vgap*SQRT(X*Ls/Lp) And that's the BASIC theory behind a 2-coil system! Reality-Check Time: ================== In practice, the actual interrelationships that govern coil operation are considerably more complex thant implied above. Simply aiming for higher Vout will NOT generally deliver better performance! The actual efficiency of \"incinerating the air\" (that is, getting the LONGEST sparks for the MINIMAL input power or coil size) is a very complex, and still rather poorly understood, combination of bang-size, primary and secondary impedances, coupling coefficient, gap quenching, streamer loading, top-load capacitance, operating frequency, breakrate, charging circuit,... well, you get the picture! http://www.altair.org/projects/TCBasics.txt (2 of 3) [10/02/03 10:19:10 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"http://www.altair.org/projects/TCBasics.txt The process of predetermining these interrelationships and tradeoffs to arrive at an optimal coil design is not yet fully understood.

A similar quandary is created by Terry Fritz's recent tests which imply that, under some conditions, 2nd-notch quenching may actually deliver longer sparklength than the more theoretically optimal 1st-Notch quench. Most experienced coilers end up developing a \"feel\" for what's optimal through hard-won experience...

It is interesting to note that he was a Serbian of \" Valachian\" descent. Tesla was proud of his Croatian motherland and Serbian descent. When his mother died in 1892, he paid a visit to Croatian capital Zagreb, and gave a lecture about alternating current. On that occasion Tesla said: \"As a son of my homeland, I feel it is my duty to help the city of Zagreb in every respect with my advice and work\" - ( \"Smatram svojom duznoscu da kao rodeni sin svoje zemlje pomognem gradu Zagrebu u svakom pogledu savjetom i cinom\" ). Nikola Tesla, besides being a great inventor and an outspoken Serbian patriot, had sincerely adored free Serb states, Serbia and Montenegro, and the rest of the Serbdom which pinched unliberated under Austro-Hungarian and Turkish yoke. He had never hidden his patriotic feelings, on the contrary-he stressed them! On 1st of June 1892, Tesla arrived in Belgrade due to the call from Belgrade municipality. Several thousand people greeted him at the Belgrade train station. He addressed the gathered crowd, who saluted him: \"There is something within me that might be illusion as it is often case with young delighted people, but if I would be fortunate to achieve some of my ideals, it would be on the behalf of the whole of humanity. If those hopes would become fulfilled, the most exiting thought would be that it is a deed of a Serb. Long live Serbdom!...\" Tesla further said to the students of Belgrade University: \"As you can see and hear, I have remained a Serb overseas where I have done some researches. You should do so and by your knowledge and hard work you should glorify Serbdom over the world.\" One of Tesla's proudest moments was when he was granted his United States citizenship; he never lost his love of his homeland, however. His monument, carved by Ivan Mestrovic (who knew Tesla personally), can be seen in Zagreb. Another monument, carved by Croatian sculptor Frano Krsinic, can be seen on \"Goat Island\", near the former Tesla Hydropower Plant on Niagara Falls, in the middle of the Niagara River, between the United States and Canada boarders. It is purposely left un-illuminated at night (for the effect, and, to provoke thought of what the world would be like without Tesla's contributions). A part of the Technical Museum in Zagreb is dedicated to Nikola Tesla. Even today, so many years after Tesla's death in 1943, his numerous manuscripts are kept as \"top secret\" by the US Ministry of Defense (see Margaret Cheney, \"Tesla: Man Out of Time\", Prentice Hall, 1981) Nikola Tesla , an American inventor and engineer, whose mastery of electricity came at a time when electricity was changing American life. Tesla is the unsung creator of the electric age, without whom our radio, auto ignition, telephone, alternating current power generation, alternating current transmission, radio, and television, would all have been impossible. He discovered the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current machinery, and held more than 700 patents. His inventions make him one of the foremost pioneers in the distribution of electric energy. Born into a family of Serbian origin, Tesla’s father was an Orthodox priest. He had several sisters and one older brother, Dane, who died when Nikola was five. In his autobiography ( \"My Inventions\"), Tesla tells of the early workings of his mind in a description that we can only regard with amazement. He began seeing flashes of light that interfered with his physical vision. When a word was spoken, he would envision the object so http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (1 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. clearly that he had trouble distinguishing between the imagined (spoken) object and the real. In later years, he would build a machine in his mind, run it to see where it was flawed, and make whatever repairs and adjustments were needed, before he ever began his construction. At night and in solitude, Tesla had an inner world of personal vision where he made journeys to distant places, studies, carried on conversations and met people that seemed as real to him as his outer world. By the time he was a teenager he spoke four languages. At about age 17, he found to his delight that he could create things in his mind, picturing them as the finished product without models, drawings or experiments. He invented such things as a low friction finless waterwheel and a motor driven by June bugs. He trained to be an engineer, attending the Technical University at Graz, Austria and the University of Prague. Beginning his studies in physics and mathematics at Graz Polytechnic, he then took philosophy at the University of Prague. After finishing the studies at the Polytechnic Institute, doing two years of study in one, working 19 hours a day and sleeping only two, he suffered a complete nervous breakdown. During the malady, he observed many phenomena, both strange and unbelievable. His vision and hearing intensified beyond any normal human capacity. He could sense objects in the dark in the same way as a bat. It was a period in which his sensitivities were so heightened that the flashes of light that he had seen from the time he was a youth now filled the air around him with tongues of living flame. Their intensity, instead of diminishing, increased with time, and seemingly attained a maximum when he was about twenty-five years old. His responses were so keenly tuned that a word would become an image that he could feel see and taste. It was during this time that he had one of his most famous ideas; the rotating magnetic field and alternating current induction motor. Bringing himself back to the world as it is, Tesla began work as an electrical engineer with the Central Telegraph Office in Budapest, Hungary in 1881 and the following year, he went to work in Paris for the Continental Edison Company. In 1883 he constructed, after work hours, his first induction motor. He sailed to America in 1884, arriving with four cents in his pocket. He found immediate employment with Thomas Edison - who quickly became a rival - Edison being an advocate of the inferior DC power transmission system. For the remainder of his life, Tesla would have, at times, difficulty getting his ideas and inventions funded because most financiers were in Edison’s corner. Even later in his life, many of his ideas and inventions could not get funding, and so remained in notebooks, which are still examined to this day, by engineers searching for clues from his brilliant scientific mind. Edison and Tesla parted company within a year due to a false promise made by Edison. Tesla was told (by Edison) that if he could repair all of the faulty and broken down motors and generators in the Edison plant that he would receive $50,000.00 for his effort. This Tesla did, and in record time, no less. At the completion of the repair work, Tesla approached Edison for the monies that were promised, at which time Edison replied that he was only \"joking\" about the money. Tesla did not find it very \"funny\" and left his employ. Perhaps the lowest point in his life was in 1884-85 after he left Edison, and without recognition or a mentor, had to take manual labor to survive. He was digging ditches at $2.00 a day when he met Mr. A. K. Brown of the Western Union Telegraph Company who put up some of his own money and interested a friend in joining him in Tesla's project. Shortly thereafter, Tesla was commissioned with the design of the AC generators installed at Niagara Falls. Tesla and Edison have often been represented as rivals. They were rivals, to a certain extent, in the battle between the alternating and direct current in which Tesla championed the former. He won; the great power plants at Niagara Falls and elsewhere are founded on the Tesla system. Otherwise the two men were merely opposites. Edison had a genius for practical inventions immediately applicable. Tesla, whose inventions were far ahead of the time, aroused antagonisms which delayed the fruition of his ideas for years. However, great physicists like Kelvin and Crookes spoke of his inventions as marvelous. \"Tesla,\" said Professor A. E. Kennelly, of Harvard University, when the Edison medal was presented to the inventor, \"set wheels going round all over the world. . . . What he showed was a revelation to science and art unto all time.\" In May 1885, George Westinghouse purchased the patents to his induction motor, his polyphase system of http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (2 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. alternating-current dynamos, transformers and motors and made this the basis of the Westinghouse power system which still underlies the modern electrical power industry today. When Westinghouse found that they could not stay in business if they paid him his due of Twelve Million Dollars, Tesla tore up the contract. Tesla did this, quite simply, so people could have the benefit of financially attainable electricity. Tesla made his first million before he was 40, but gave up the royalties on his most profitable invention as a humanitarian gesture. In April 1887, he established his own laboratory, where he experimented with shadowgraphs similar to those involved in the discovery of x-rays. In 1888 his discovery that a magnetic field could be made to rotate if two coils at right angles are supplied with AC current 90 degrees out of phase made possible the invention of the AC induction motor. The major advantage of this motor being its brushless operation, which many at the time was believed impossible. By 1890, Tesla was a young, striking and desirable bachelor. Handsome, magnetic and elegant, he was the \"catch\" of New York society, yet remained unmarried and a misanthrope. He was wealthy, gifted, accomplished and recognized. He wore his clothes well and was quiet and modest. Many a designing matron with a marriageable daughter was eager to capture him for her salon. Social leaders and businessmen considered him a good contact and the intellectuals of his day found him an inspiration. However, Tesla proved to be impervious, an unattainable prize. Except at formal dinners he always dined alone, and never under any circumstances would he dine with a woman at a twosome dinner. At the Waldorf-Astoria and at the famous Delmonico's restaurant, he had picked out particular discrete tables, which were always reserved for him. In spite of all of the adulation that was heaped upon him, Tesla had but one desire – to continue his work. He lived the life of a celibate and a hermit. He enjoyed poetry and the opera and though he was not a drinker, he appreciated a glass of beer and advocated the limited consumption of liquor as an elixir of life. In 1915 he was severely disappointed when a report that he and Edison were to share the Nobel Prize proved erroneous. Tesla was the recipient of the Edison Medal in 1917, the highest honor that the American Institute of Electrical Engineers could bestow. When others claimed credit for the revolutionary ideas that came from his extraordinary mind, he did not contest them. Impractical in financial matters, eccentric and compulsive, Tesla had few friends, but those included Mark Twain, John J. O’Neill and Francis Marion Crawford. He never married, and cited on at least one occasion that marriage wasn’t good for inventors. He was driven by compulsions and had a progressive germ phobia, washing his hands frequently and avoiding shaking hands and measuring the volume of his food before he ate it. He liked a fresh tablecloth with every meal. Always a fastidious dresser, he wore new gloves weekly and a new tie daily. He maintained the same weight through his lifetime, 142 pounds, and always slept only four hours per night. The Inventions: Tesla believed that alternating current was vastly superior to (Edison's) direct current, but the problem was the lack of a practical motor. Alternating current is practical because of the fact that it can be altered, or converted, to suit a variety of situations. For example, if the voltage is made quite high, then the current necessary for a specific level of power is very low. This low current then becomes very efficient when sending electrical power over very long wires. (This is the reason why the power lines running across the countryside are at very high voltages.) Tesla also worked with radio-frequency electromagnetic waves, and, despite the claims made by Marconi, actually did invent the idea of Radio as we know it today. (There are numerous patents which bear this out. Even today, many texts still credit Marconi with the invention of radio, despite the Supreme Court decision which overruled the Marconi patent, awarding it to Tesla. Unfortunately, this decision came two years after Tesla's own death.) In working with radio waves, Tesla created the Tesla coil as a means to generate and receive this form of energy. Every time you start your automobile ( or virtually any type of vehicle, for that matter) the device that provides \"spark\" to the spark plug, thus enabling the engine to start, is a unit either wholly or in part, a Tesla Coil. Tesla postulated the ability to locate objects in the air or in the ground by using radio waves. Today, we call it \"RADAR\", and when used to peer into the human body, \"MRI\". Tesla also created radio controlled devices., or http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (3 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. \"Teli-autonomotons\". His work with special gas filled lamps set the stage for the creation of fluorescent lighting, and neon lights. Tesla patented dozens of devices ranging from speedometers to extremely efficient electrical generators. One unique device was his bladeless boundary disk turbine. Instead of using fan-type blades, Tesla's turbine utilized solid disks of metal, and relied on what is called the \"boundary layer effect\". His turbine ran on either compressed air or steam or gasoline explosions, and was so efficient that a device held in the hand could produce well over 10 horsepower! One of the largest turbines that Tesla designed pumped out 10,000 Horse-power, and was about one fifth the size and weight of the engines of its day. Today, this bladeless technology is being used in a special type of non-clogging pump designed for the oil industry. The turbine is awaiting commercial use, and public acceptance., but developments are rapidly making it again seem attractive. Frank Germano, of International Turbine And Power , of Cody Wyoming, USA is pioneering the design of a special Tesla-Type turbine for the commercial power markets. This turbine can be run on any combustible fuel (propane, methane, gasoline, diesel, hydrogen), steam, or even water under pressure. Read an article appearing in the \"Bulletin of Atomic Scientists\" January 2003 to see what Frank Germano is doing to bring this technology into commercial reality. To see how you - the reader - could actually HELP me bring this technology to commercial reality - click on this link - How Can You Help Bring This Technology to The Commercial Market?! It has been said that Tesla is the \" Forgotten Father of Technology. \" It is hard to believe that a man who gave the world so much, received so little for his efforts. History books have been equally unkind. In many parts of this country, people still refer to the electric utility as the 'Edison Company', even though they use the Tesla-Westinghouse alternating current system, not Edison's direct current. At the Niagara Falls power generating station, a small statue of Tesla is purposely left un-illuminated at night. I have visited this statue, and it is a quite stunning statement to witness the statue in complete darkness, with the surrounding area ablaze with lighting supplied from Tesla's own inventions. Tesla also had a deep desire to provide wireless electricity across the globe. First, there was the patent infringement issue, which made millionaires of others, particularly the Marconi Company. But Tesla maintained a single-minded focus on developing global wireless communications and energy systems. Working in Colorado Springs in 1899, Tesla developed a transmitter to perfect a method by which transmitted energy could be channeled through natural media. In Colorado Springs, Colorado, Tesla built a laboratory to develop this. The Colorado Springs lab contained the largest Tesla Coil ever built. Called the Magnifying Transmitter, it was capable of generating some 300,000 watts of power, and could produce a bolt of lightning over 130 feet long. According to local accounts, Tesla actually managed to successfully transmit about 30 to 50 thousand watts of power, without wires, using the Transmitter. There are detailed accounts of these feats, below. Two years later, 1901, working on Long Island at Wardenclyffe, he set to work on his ultimate goal: construction of a \"world telegraphy center\" that was to have a lab, a wireless transmitter and production facilities for manufacturing oscillators and vacuum tubes. Constructed on the \"model city's\" 1,800 acres would be homes, stores and buildings to accommodate 2,500 workers... at least, that was the dream... By that year's end, however, Marconi had usurped the inventor by transmitting an overseas signal. That left Tesla at the mercy of his financier, J.P. Morgan, who literally pulled the plug on his vision. Morgan, at the time the prime force behind General Electric Co., may have been unnerved by Tesla's claims that the technology http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (4 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. could transmit \"unlimited power\" by wireless means. The word \"free\" did not translate well to Morgan. Again, the money flow came to a halt. Some Tesla devotees suspect he may have been a pioneer of the transistor. \"Inventors of the modern computer have repeatedly been surprised, when seeking patents, to encounter Tesla's basic ones already on file,\" noted Tesla historian Leland Anderson, a former EE and a board member of the Wardenclyffe project. Indeed, two of Tesla's patents from 1903 contain the basic principles of the logical \"AND\" circuit element. Tesla went on to experiment with actual wireless transmission of electrical power. Despite his accomplishments, by 1915, at age 60, Tesla was living on credit and drifting from one cheap hotel another, a victim of his own poor business decisions, underdeveloped ideas and inability to create another innovation as profound as the AC paradigm. In 1931, at the age of 75, Tesla received birthday greetings from Lee de Forest and Albert Einstein. In his later years he spent most of his time at the New York Public Library or feeding pigeons that he called- “my sincere friends\". By 1943, he had begun suffering heart trouble and fainting spells along with some mental confusion. On January 1st, 1943 he complained of chest pains during an experiment and returned to the hotel room where he lived. The last person to see him alive was a hotel maid on January 5th, 1943. It is assumed that he died January 7th, 1943 in New York City and his body was discovered on the following day. Over 2,000 people attended his funeral in Manhattan. So, at age 86, the great inventor died alone, nearly penniless and all but forgotten. Years earlier, however, Tesla had appeared to predict the posthumous recognition that today's scientific community would afford him when he wrote: \"Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments.\" And what accomplishments they were, Dr. Tesla. The world would be a very dark place, without you. \" The present is theirs ; the future, for which I really work , is mine. \" Nikola Tesla \"Quick-click\" Index to this Page.

In an article which appeared recently in The Electrical World Mr. Tesla explains the theories on which the world telegraphy system is founded and what he expects to accomplish by it. http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (5 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. His plans involve the establishment of stations for the transmission of messages and power, \"preferably near important centers of civilization.\" Oddly enough, what Mr. Tesla proudly designates as the first of his commercial \"world telegraphy\" stations has been established at Wardenclyffe, L.I., which is not in any sense an important \"centre of civilization,\" but a place described by train hands of the Long Island Railroad as a way station where \"a passenger alights occasionally.\" Tesla's \"Magnifying Transmitter\", at Wardenclyffe, Shoreham, LI (New York). The transmitting station is an octagonal tower, pyramidal in shape, and some 187 feet in height. It consists of huge wooden stilts, heavily braced, and reinforced, and surmounted by a cupola of interlaced steel wires, bent so as to form an arc. In the cupola there is a wooden platform occupying its entire width. Mr. Tesla began work on his transmitting station about eighteen months ago. When he first came there, and it was understood that J. Pierpont Morgan had become interested in his odd enterprise and furnished him with financial assistance, a thrill of vague expectancy ran through the little settlement, The Wardenclyffe Land Company, which owns practically all the available ground in the vicinity, gave the inventor a free grant of some 175 acres of fine land, and then settled down to wait for the day when Wardenclyffe would become the centre of the universe. Some of the farmers who come to Wardenclyffe to send their products to this city look at Mr. Tesla's tower, which is situated directly opposite the railroad station, and shake their heads sadly. They are inclined to take a skeptical view regarding the feasibility of the wireless \"world telegraphy\" idea, but yet Tesla's transmitting tower as it stands in lonely grandeur and boldly silhouetted against the sky on a wide clearing on the concession is a source or great satisfaction and of some mystification to them all. \"It is a mighty fine tower,\" said one food farmer to a visitor last week. \"The breeze up there is something grand on a Summer evening, and you can see the Sound and all the steamers that go by. We are tired, though, trying to figure out why he put it here instead of at Coney Island. \" While the tower itself is very \"stagy\" and picturesque, it is the wonders that are supposed to be hidden in the earth underneath it that excite the curiosity of the population in the little settlement. In the centre of the wide concrete platform which serves as a base for the structure there is a wooden affair very much like the companionway on an ocean steamer. The tower and the enclosure in which it has been built are being carefully guarded these days, and no one except Mr. Tesla's own men are allowed to approach it. Only they have been allowed as much as the briefest peep down the companionway. Mr. Scherff, the private secretary of the inventor, told an inquirer that the companionway led to a small drainage passage built for the purpose of keeping the ground about the tower dry. But such of the villagers as saw the tower constructed tell a different story. They declare that it leads to a well- like excavation as deep as the tower is high with walls of mason work and a circular stairway leading to the bottom. http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (6 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. From there, they say, tunnels have been built in all directions, until the entire ground below the little plain on which the tower is raised has been honeycombed with subterranean passages. They tell with awe how Mr. Tesla, on his weekly visits to Wardenclyffe, spends as much time in the underground passages as he does on the tower or in the handsome laboratory and workshop erected beside it, and where the power plant for the world telegraph has been installed. No instruments have been installed as yet in the transmitter, nor has Mr. Tesla given any description of what they will be like. But in his article he announces that he will transmit from the tower an electric wave of a total maximum activity of ten million horse power. This, he says, will be possible with a plant of but 100 horse power, by the use of a magnifying transmitter of his own invention and certain artifices which he promises to make known in due course. What he expects to accomplish is summed up in the closing paragraph as follows: \"When the great truth, accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed, is fully recognized, that this planet, with all its appalling immensity, is to electric currents virtually no more than a small metal ball and that by virtue of this fact many possibilities, each baffling imagination and of incalculable consequence, are rendered absolutely sure of accomplishment; when the first plant is inaugurated and it is shown that a telegraphic message, almost as secret and non-interferable as a thought, can be transmitted to any terrestrial distance, the sound of the human voice, with all its intonations and inflections faithfully and instantly reproduced at any other point of the globe, the energy of a waterfall made available for supplying light, heat or motive power, anywhere...on sea, or land, or high in the air...humanity will be like an ant heap stirred up with a stick. See the excitement coming!\" \"Cloud born Electric Wavelets To Encircle the Globe: This Is Nicola Tesla's Latest Dream, and the Long Island Hamlet of Wardenclyffe Marvels Thereat,\" New York Times, 27 March 1904. Let's continue: As a young man, Nikola Tesla talked often of the possibility of interplanetary communication. Influenced by Buddhist philosophy and the thinking of Ernst Mach, Tesla began to develop a cosmology that tried to get at the heart of what life was and simultaneously discover electricity's role in the process. He believed in the concept of an all-pervasive aether and also believed that machines could be developed that would have the capability of thinking for themselves. \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\", which was published 100 years ago (as of June 2000) in Century Magazine spells out Tesla's thoughts and visions for the future of mankind. This was written at the pinnacle of Tesla's life, when he was full of vigor, fresh from his startling accomplishments with the complete victory of his alternating current system over Edison's direct current system. In a radical departure from his previous writings which were of a technical nature, Tesla reveals his philosophy and hopes for humankind. In the article, Tesla expressed his belief that all of us are responsible for increasing the human mass, morally, intellectually, and physically. It was a radical article then... and in some circles... still be considered radical. Nonetheless it caught the eye of JP Morgan who financed Tesla's biggest dream... and most devastating disappointment.. Wardenclyffe!

Tesla's life changed dramatically after Wardenclyffe. Initially his focus was on developing his bladeless turbine; but always his thoughts turned towards the revival of Wardenclyffe and his beloved Magnifying Transmitter. In 1925, his ideas on the wireless transmission of power were briefly entertained by the Bureau of Standards, but were abruptly rejected out of hand... due to the ignorance of how Tesla's system worked. As an elderly man, Tesla discussed controversial topics such as free energy, particle beam weapons, cosmic rays that travel faster than light speed, a new magnifying transmitter which could harness these cosmic rays, interplanetary communication and also the claim that he could transmit energy at twice the speed of light. The identification of each separate invention became a somewhat confusing task for journalists and researchers because each of these ideas involve the transmission of energy to distant places: and the so called “death ray” apparently, in its final form, comprised features from some, if not all of the other inventions above. It is these exotic inventions that interest and fuels the free energy researchers imagination. It was Tesla's claim that he could transmit energy at twice the speed of light that brought Tesla in direct conflict with Einstein's suggestion that space was curved--the conventional mode of thought at the time. Tesla's unique views on the nature of radioactivity also placed him out of the mainstream scientific world. Was Tesla simply delusional ... or did he indeed have a keen insight into the wheel work of Nature? Time will tell.

The Complete Tesla. Back To INDEX THE WIRELESS TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICAL POWER It is possible that Nikola Tesla is best known for his remarkable statements regarding the wireless transmission of electrical power. His first efforts towards this end started in 1891 and were intended to simply \"disturb the electrical equilibrium in the nearby portions of the earth... to bring into operation in any way some instrument.\" In other words the object of his experiments was simply to produce effects locally and detect them at a distance. By 1899 the electrical potential of his transmitter had increased to the point that more room was needed for the sake of safety. This and other considerations led him to temporarily shift his wireless experiments to a location just outside of Colorado Springs. At this Colorado \"Experimental Station\" Tesla had some early success in wireless power transmission. One photograph shows that \"a small incandescent lamp was lighted by means of a resonant circuit grounded on one end, all the energy being drawn through the earth [from a nearby transmitter].\" In 1907 he even went as far as to make this statement: \"... to make the little filament glow, the entire surface of the planet, two hundred million square miles, must be strongly electrified. This calls for peculiar electrical activities, hundreds of times greater than those involved in the lighting of an arc lamp through the human body [a far more spectacular demonstration]. What impresses him most, however, is the knowledge that the little lamp will spring into the same brilliancy anywhere on the globe, there being no appreciable diminution of the effect with the increase of distance from the transmitter.\" (One of Tesla's favorite pictures of himself- above, Left) It is not at all clear that Tesla was referring to effects produced by his large Colorado transmitter. It is quite possible that he was writing about what could be done with an even bigger transmitter such as the one that he was developing in New York. If the Wardenclyffe communications facility had been finished, the 187 foot tall mushroom-shaped tower would have permanently housed a set of large coils including an immense helical resonator that would have served as the main transmitting element. Directly below the wooden tower there was a 120 foot shaft where deep underground Tesla had installed a radial array of iron pipes that served as a connection between the oscillator and the earth. The Wardenclyffe plant was a major milestone in Tesla's researches into the application of alternating electrical currents to wireless communications and power transmission, an effort which drew a considerable amount of Tesla's attention during the period between 1891 and 1912. In the article \"The Future of the Wireless Art\" which appeared in Wireless Telegraphy & Telephony, 1908, Tesla made the following statement regarding the Wardenclyffe project on which he was then working: \"As soon as completed, it will be possible for a business man in New York to dictate instructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London or elsewhere. He will be able to call up, from his desk, and talk to any telephone subscriber on the globe, without any change whatever in the existing equipment. An inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, will enable its bearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land, music or song, the speech of a political leader, the address of an eminent man of science, or the sermon of an eloquent clergyman, delivered in some other place, however distant. In the same manner any picture, character, drawing, or print can be transferred from one to another place. Millions of such instruments can be operated from but one plant of this kind. More important than this, however, will be the transmission of power, without wires, which will be shown http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (9 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. on a scale large enough to carry conviction. These few indications will be sufficient to show that the wireless art offers greater possibilities than any invention or discovery heretofore made, and if the conditions are favorable, we can expect with certitude that in the next few years wonders will be wrought by its application.\" In the end, Tesla was never able to complete the Wardenclyffe plant, although he was able to conduct some performance tests. Nevertheless, if the above stated predictions were to be true, an interesting feature of Tesla's World System for global communications, had it gone into full operation, would have been its capacity to provide small but usable quantities of electrical power at the location of the receiving circuits. A MUSEUM AT WARDENCLYFFE - THE CREATION OF A MONUMENT TO NIKOLA TESLA The year was 1900 and following 9 productive months of wireless propagation research in Colorado, Nikola Tesla was anxious to put a mass of new found knowledge to work. His vision focused on the development of a prototype wireless communications station and research facility and he needed a site on which to build. In 1901 he cast his eyes some 60 miles eastward to the north shore village of Woodville Landing. Only six years before the north branch of the Long Island Railroad had opened, reducing travel time to the locality from a horse drawn five hours to less than two. Seeing an opportunity in land development a western lawyer and banker by the name of James S. Warden had purchased 1400 acres in the area and started building an exclusive summer resort community known as Wardenclyffe-On-Sound. With an opportunity for further development in mind, Warden offered Tesla a 200 acre section of this parcel lying directly to the south of the newly laid track. It was anticipated that implementation of Tesla's system would eventually lead to the establishment of a \"Radio City\" to house the thousands of employees needed for operation of the facility. The proximity to Manhattan and the fairly short travel time between the two, along with the site's closeness to a railway line must surely have been attractive features and Tesla accepted the offer. The Wardenclyffe World Wireless facility as envisioned by Tesla was to have been quite different from present day radio broadcasting stations. While there was to be a great similarity in the apparatus employed, the method in which it was to be utilized would have been radically different. Conventional transmitters are designed so as to maximize the amount of power radiated from the antenna structure. Such equipment must process tremendous amounts of power in order to counteract the loss in field strength encountered as the signal radiates out from its point of origin. The transmitter at Wardenclyffe was being configured so as to minimize the radiated power. The energy of Tesla's steam driven Westinghouse 200 kW alternator was to be channeled instead into an extensive underground radial structure of iron pipe installed 120 feet beneath the tower's base. This was to be accomplished by superposing a low frequency baseband signal on the higher frequency signal coursing through the transmitter's helical resonator. The low frequency current in the presence of an enveloping corona-induced plasma of free charge carriers would have pumped the earth's charge. It is believed the resulting ground current and its associated wave complex would have allowed the propagation of wireless transmissions to any distance on the earth's surface with as little as 5% loss due to radiation. The terrestrial transmission line modes so excited would have supported a system with the following technical capabilities: 1. Establishment of a multi-channel global broadcasting system with programming including news, music, etc; 2. Interconnection of the world's telephone and telegraph exchanges, and stock tickers; 3. Transmission of written and printed matter, and data; 4. World wide reproduction of photographic images; 5. Establishment of a universal marine navigation and location system, including a means for the synchronization of precision timepieces; 6. Establishment of secure wireless communications services. http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (10 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. The plan was to build the first of many installations to be located near major population centers around the world. If the program had moved forward without interruption, the Long Island prototype would have been followed by additional units the first of which being built somewhere along the coast of England. By the Summer of 1902 Tesla had shifted his laboratory operations from the Houston Street Laboratory to the rural Long Island setting and work began in earnest on development of the station and furthering of the propagation research. Construction had been made possible largely through the backing of financier J. Pierpont Morgan who had offered Tesla $150,000 towards the end of 1900. By July 1904, however, this support had run out and with a subsequent major down turn in the financial markets Tesla was compelled to pursue alternative methods of financing. With funds raised through an unrecorded mortgage against the property, additional venture capital, and the sale of X-ray tube power supplies to the medical profession he was able to make ends meet for another couple of years. In spite of valiant efforts to maintain the operation, income dwindled and his employees were eventually dropped from the payroll. Still, Tesla was certain that his wireless system would yield handsome rewards if it could only be set into operation and so the work continued as he was able. A second mortgage in 1908 acquired again from the Waldorf-Astoria proprietor George C. Boldt allowed some additional bills to be paid, but debt continued to mount and between 1912 and 1915 Tesla's financial condition disintegrated. The loss of ability to make additional payments was accompanied by the collapse of his plan for high capacity trans-Atlantic wireless communications. The property was foreclosed, Nikola Tesla honored the agreement with his debtor and title on the property was signed over to Mr. Boldt. The plant's abandonment sometime around 1911-1912 followed by demolition and salvaging of the tower in 1917 essentially brought an end to this era. Tesla's April 20, 1922 loss on appeal of the judgment completely closed the door to any further chance of his developing the site. Note: Tesla had predicted that further advances would have permitted the wireless transmission of industrial amounts of electrical energy with minimal losses to any point on the earth's surface. Had he been able to complete the prototype station on Long Island and use it to demonstrate the feasibility of wireless power transmission then a plan would have been implemented for the construction of a pilot plant for this larger system at Niagara Falls, site of the world's first commercial three phase AC power plant.

He wrote confidentially: \"I have just returned from Colorado, where I have been carrying on some experiments since a few months past. The success has been even greater than I anticipated, and among other things I have absolutely demonstrated the practicability of the establishment of telegraphic communication to any point on the globe by the help of the machinery I have perfected.\" http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (11 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. The experiments Tesla referred to were preliminary steps taken toward the construction of a prototype global communications facility on eastern Long Island -- a place known as Wardenclyffe. They centered around a unique form of electrical oscillator that Tesla had developed for the production of high voltage, high frequency alternating electrical currents, an invention which his contemporaries dubbed the \"Tesla Coil.\" Also known as the disruptive discharge coil, these devices initially served as power supplies for various experimental high frequency electric lamps and other high frequency apparatus. The Tesla coil was subsequently adapted to the generation of radio frequency currents for Tesla's then decade long investigation into wireless transmission, offering a superior alternative to the high frequency electrical alternators that he had also constructed for the same purpose. Nikola Tesla's historic laboratory and wireless communications facility (left) known as Wardenclyffe, located about 65 miles east of New York City on the North Shore of Long Island. It was here this creative genius worked out the final details related to his \"World System\" for ground-based global communications. The distinctive 187 foot tall tower was demolished in 1917, but the sturdy 94 foot square building still remains standing in silent testimony to Tesla's unfulfilled dream. The main component of the classic Tesla coil is an air core electrical step-up transformer -- an assembly of two concentric wire coils positioned in fairly close proximity to each other. When an alternating current passes through the first coil or primary winding a time varying magnetic field is established which allows the transfer of energy by electromagnetic induction to the second coil or secondary winding. The transformer's primary is excited by the rapid discharge of a high voltage capacitor through a high speed switching device known as a break or circuit controller . The potential which appears at the secondary's high voltage terminal is developed through a process known as resonant rise. It can greatly exceed the voltage that would be expected from a conventional iron core transformer, using a simple calculation based upon the ratio of primary to secondary turns, that is to say, ratio of transformation. While in operation, the oscillator's primary capacitor is continuously recharged by a regular high voltage transformer, allowing for an uninterrupted flow of radio frequency current in the primary and secondary circuits. The magnifying transmitter, which was the focus of Tesla's investigations in Colorado, is an advanced form of radio frequency oscillator specifically designed for wireless transmission. In addition to the primary and secondary inductors which made up the classic Tesla coil, Tesla added a third inductor, actually a helical resonator, known as the extra coil. Power from the grounded primary / secondary combination, now known as the master oscillator, was fed to the lower end of the extra coil helical resonator through a heavy electrical conductor. This centrally located extra coil was separated by a wide space from the other two coils, which comprised the master oscillator section. Such spacing minimizes inductive coupling between the extra coil and the master oscillator, preventing, for the most part, a portion of the energy that is continuously flowing into the resonator from passing backward through the system and becoming lost. In addition to maximizing the efficiency of the system, allowing development of the highest possible power output for power consumed, the extra coil also served as the device's main transmitting element. (Operational Tesla Coils - Left and right)) While Tesla's wireless transmitter and present day radio transmitters are fundamentally the same, the method in which Tesla preferred to use his apparatus was radically different from that which is employed in present day radio systems. Conventional radio transmitters are set up so as to maximize the amount of power radiated from the antenna. When used http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (12 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. for long range transmission, such equipment must process tremendous amounts of power in order to counteract the reduction in field strength (P = 1/R2) encountered as the signal radiates outward from its point of origin. In contrast, Tesla's magnifying transmitter was configured so as to minimize the power which was radiated out into space. Instead of being directed into an elevated antenna, the electrical energy flowing through Tesla's transmitter was sent instead into the extra coil. Rather than acting as a radiator, the large metallic spheroid, now known as an isotropic capacitance, which Tesla positioned above the extra coil was intended only as a reservoir for electrical charge. Another important component of Tesla's Long Island apparatus was an underground array of iron pipes which extended outward from the bottom of a deep shaft beneath the transmitter tower. When coupled with the transmitter these pipes provided a connection to the earth through which a powerful oscillating electrical current would flow. Unlike a conventional radio transmitter with an antenna that radiates dissipating electromagnetic waves out into space, the magnifying transmitter's extra coil excites a low-frequency ground wave called the Zenneck surface wave. In this case the propagating energy does not radiate into space but is concentrated near the earth's surface. Furthermore, Tesla asserted that it is possible to periodically disturb the equilibrium of the earth's electrical charge and cause it to oscillate with his apparatus. This would be accomplished by superposing an extra low frequency baseband signal on the somewhat higher frequency signal coursing through the resonator -- the low frequency current in the presence of an enveloping corona-induced plasma of free charge carriers produced by the oscillator in effect \"pumping\" the earth's charge. (Pike's Peak Power Station, in Colorado, left) It is believed the resulting ground current with the associated Zenneck surface wave complex would have propagated wireless transmissions to any distance around the earth with as little as 5% loss due to radiation. Using a global array of these magnifying transmitters, it was Tesla's plan to establish what he called the World System, providing multichannel global broadcasting, an array of secure wireless telecommunications services, and a long range aid to navigation, including means for the precise synchronization of clocks. In a more highly developed state he envisioned the World System could expand to include the wireless transmission of electrical power. Telsa at work, left. The shot was taken without Tesla actually in the room with the coil in operation, and the images were combined using a technique similar to a \"time delay\", double exposure shot. No one could survive in the room with the voltage present, not even Tesla, himself. It does make for a great effect, though, which is exactly what the picture did, at the time. Back to INDEX The World System of Power; \"Wardenclyffe\" Shoreham, Long Island, New York THE year 1900 marked to Tesla not only the opening of a new century but also the beginning of the world- superpower and radio-broadcasting era. With the encouragement of J. P. Morgan to spur him on--if he could accommodate any more spurring than his own inner drive furnished--and with $150,000 in cash from the same source, he was set to embark upon a gigantic venture, the building of a world wireless-power and a world broadcasting station. The cash on hand would be totally inadequate to finance the project to completion, but this did not deter him http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (13 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. from making a start. He needed a laboratory both to replace the Houston Street establishment, which had become entirely inadequate, and to include equipment of the type employed at Colorado Springs, but designed for use in the actual world-broadcasting process. The location was determined as the result of an arrangement he made with James S. Warden, manager and director of the Suffolk County Land Company, a lawyer and banker from the West who had acquired two thousand acres of land at Shoreham, in Suffolk County, Long Island, about sixty miles from New York. The land was made the basis of a real-estate development under the name Wardenclyffe. Tesla visualized a power-and-broadcasting station which would employ thousands of persons. He undertook the establishment, eventually, of a Radio City, something far more ambitious than the enterprise in Rockefeller Center in New York which bears this name today. Tesla planned to have all wavelength channels broadcast from a single station, a project which would have given him a complete monopoly of the radio-broadcasting business. What an opportunity nearsighted businessmen of his day overlooked in not getting in on his project! But in that day Tesla was about the only one who visualized modern broadcasting. Everyone else visualized wireless as being useful only for sending telegraphic communications between ship and shore and across the ocean. Mr. Warden saw possibilities of a sort in Tesla's plan, however, and offered him a tract of two hundred acres, of which twenty acres were cleared, for his power station, with the expectation that the two thousand men who would shortly be employed in the station would build homes on convenient sites in the remainder of the 2,000-acre tract. Tesla accepted. Stanford White, the famous designer of many churches and other architectural monuments throughout the country, was one of Tesla's friends. He now disclosed to the famous architect his vision of an industrial \"city beautiful'' and sought his cooperation in realizing his dream. Mr. White was enthusiastic about the idea and, as his contribution to Tesla's work, offered to underwrite the cost of designing the strange tower the inventor sketched, and all of the architectural work involved in the general plan for the city. The actual work was done by W. D. Crow, of East Orange, N. J., one of Mr. White's associates, who later became famous as a designer of hospitals and other institutional buildings. It was a fantastic-looking tower, with strange structural limitations, which Mr. Crow found himself designing. Tesla required a tower, about 154 feet high, to support at its peak a giant copper electrode 100 feet in diameter and shaped like a gargantuan doughnut with a tubular diameter of twenty feet. (This was later changed to a hemispherical electrode.) The tower would have to be a skeletonized structure, built almost entirely of wood, metal to be reduced to an utter minimum and any metal fixtures employed to be of copper. No engineering data were available on wood structures of this height and type. The structure Tesla required had a large amount of \"sail area,'' or surface exposed to wind, concentrated at the top, creating stresses that had to be provided for in a tower that itself possessed only limited stability. Mr. Crow solved the engineering problems and then the equally difficult task of incorporating esthetic qualities in such an edifice. When the design was completed another difficulty was encountered. None of the well-known builders could be induced to undertake the task of erecting the tower. A competent framer, associated with Norcross Bros., who were a large contracting firm in those days, finally took over the contract, although he, too, expressed fears that the winter gales might overturn the structure. (It stood, however, for a dozen years. When the Government, for military reasons decided it was necessary to remove this conspicuous landmark during the First World War, heavy charges of dynamite were necessary in order to topple it, and even then it remained intact on the ground like a fallen Martian invader out of Wells' War of the Worlds.) The tower was completed in 1902, and with it a large low brick building more than 100 feet square which would provide quarters for the powerhouse and laboratory. While the structures were being built, Tesla commuted every day from the Waldorf-Astoria to Wardenclyffe, arriving at the nearby Shoreham station shortly after eleven am and remaining until three-thirty. He was always accompanied by a man servant, a Serbian, who http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (14 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. carried a heavy hamper filled with food. When the laboratory transferred from Houston Street was in full operation at Wardenclyffe, Tesla rented the Bailey cottage near the Long Island Sound shore and there made his home for a year. The heavy equipment, the dynamos and motors, that Tesla desired for his plant were of an unusual design not produced by manufacturers, and he encountered many vexatious delays in securing such material. He was able to carry on a wide range of high-frequency current and other experiments in his new laboratory, but the principal project, that of setting up the worldwide broadcasting station, lagged. Meanwhile, he had a number of glass blowers making tubes for use in transmitting and receiving his broadcast programs. This was a dozen years before De Forest invented the form of radio tube now in general use. The secret of Tesla's tubes died with him. Tesla seemed to be entirely fearless of his high-frequency currents of millions of volts. He had, nevertheless, the greatest respect for the electric current in all forms, and was extremely careful in working on his apparatus. When working on circuits that might come \"alive,'' he always worked with one hand in his pocket, using the other to manipulate tools. He insisted that all of his workers do likewise when working on the 60-cycle low- frequency alternating-current circuits, whether the potential was 50,000 or 110 volts. This safeguard reduced the possibility of a dangerous current finding a circuit through the arms across the body, where there was chance that it might stop the action of the heart. In spite of the great care which he manifested in all of his experimental work, he had a narrow escape from losing his life at the Wardenclyffe plant. He was making experiments on the properties of small-diameter jets of water moving at high velocity and under very high pressures, of the order of 10,000 pounds per square inch. Such a stream could be struck by a heavy iron bar without the stream being disrupted. The impinging bar would bounce back as if it had struck another solid iron bar...a strange property for a mechanically weak substance like water. The cylinder holding the water under high pressure was a heavy one made of wrought iron. Tesla was unable to secure a wrought-iron cap for the upper surface, so he used a heavier one of cast iron, a more brittle metal. One day when he raised the pressure to a point higher than he had previously used, the cylinder exploded. The cast-iron cap broke and a large fragment shot within a few inches of his face as it went on a slanting path upward and finally crashed through the roof. The high-pressure stream of water had peculiar destructive effects on anything with which it came in contact, even tough, strong metals. Tesla never revealed the purpose or the results of these high-pressure experiments. Tesla's insistence on the utmost neatness in his laboratory almost resulted in a tragedy through a case of thoughtlessness on the part of an assistant. Arrangements were being made for installing a heavy piece of machinery which was to be lag bolted to the thick concrete floor. Holes had been drilled in the concrete. The plan called for pouring molten lead into these holes and screwing the heavy bolts into the metal when it cooled. As soon as the holes were drilled, a young assistant starting cleaning up the debris. He not only swept up the stone chips and dust: he got a mop and thoroughly washed that area of the floor, thoughtlessly letting some of the water get into the holes. He then dried the floor. In the meantime Tesla and George Scherff, who was his financial secretary but also served in any way in which he could be helpful, were melting the lead which would hold the lag screws in the holes in the floor. Scherff took the first large ladleful of lead from the furnace and started across the laboratory to where the holes had been drilled, followed shortly by Tesla bearing another ladle. Scherff bent down, and as he poured the hot liquid metal into one of the holes an explosion followed instantly. The molten lead was blown upward into his face in a shower of searing hot drops of liquid metal. The water which the assistant used to swab the floor had settled into the holes and, when the melted lead come in contact with it, it was changed to steam which shot the lead out of the hole like a bullet out of the barrel of a riffle. Both men were showered with drops of hot metal and dropped their ladles. Tesla, being several feet away, was only slightly injured; but Scherff was very seriously burned about the face and hands. Drops of the http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (15 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. metal had struck his eyes and so severely burned them that it was feared for a while that his sight could not be saved. However, despite the almost unlimited possibilities for accidents in connection with the vast variety of experiments which Tesla conducted in totally unexplored fields, using high voltages, high amperages, high pressures, high velocities and high temperatures, he went through his entire career with only one accident in which he suffered injury. In that a sharp instrument slipped, entered his palm and penetrated through the hand. The accident to Scherff was the only one in which a member of his staff was injured, with the exception of a young assistant who developed X-ray burns. He had probably been exposed to the rays from one of Tesla's tubes which, unknown to Tesla and everyone else, had been producing them even before Roentgen announced their discovery. Tesla had given them another name and had not fully investigated their properties. This was probably the first case of X-ray burns on record. Tesla was an indefatigable worker, and it was hard for him to understand why others were incapable of such feats of endurance as he was able to accomplish. He was willing to pay unusually high wages to workers who were willing to stick with him on protracted tasks but never demanded that anyone work beyond a reasonable day's labor. On one occasion a piece of long-awaited equipment arrived and Tesla was anxious to get it installed and operating as quickly as possible. The electricians worked through twenty-four hours, stopping only for meals, and then for another twenty-four hours. The workers then dropped out, one by one, picking out nooks in the building in which to sleep. While they took from eight to twelve hours' sleep, Tesla continued to work; and when they came back to the job Tesla was still going strong and worked with them through his third sleepless twenty-four-hour period. The men were then given several days off in which to rest up; but Tesla, apparently none the worse for his seventy-two hours of toil, went through his next day of experiments, accomplishing a total of eighty-four hours without sleep or rest. The plant at Wardenclyffe was intended primarily for demonstrating the radio-broadcasting phase of his \"World System''; the power-distribution station was to be built at Niagara Falls. Tesla at this time published a brochure on his \"World System'' which indicates the remarkable state of advancement he had projected in the wireless art, now called radio, while other experimenters were struggling to acquire familiarity with rudimentary devices. At that time, however, his promises seemed fantastic. The brochure contained the following description of his system and his objectives: The World System has resulted from a combination of several original discoveries made by the inventor in the course of long continued research and experimentation. It makes possible not only the instantaneous and precise wireless transmission of any kind of signals, messages or characters, to all parts of the world, but also the interconnection of the existing telegraph, telephone, and other signal stations without any change in their present equipment. By its means, for instance, a telephone subscriber here many call up any other subscriber on the Globe. An inexpensive receiver, not bigger than a watch, will enable him to listen anywhere, on land or sea, to a speech delivered, or music played in some other place, however distant. These examples are cited merely to give an idea of the possibilities of this great scientific advance, which annihilates distance and makes that perfect conductor, the Earth, available for all the innumerable purposes which human ingenuity has found for a line wire. One far reaching result of this is that any device capable of being operated through one or more wires (at a distance obviously restricted) can likewise be actuated, without artificial conductors and with the same facility and accuracy, at distances to which there are no limits other than those imposed by the physical dimensions of the Globe. Thus, not only will entirely new fields for commercial exploitation be opened up by this ideal method of transmission, but the old ones vastly extended. The World System is based on the application of the following important inventions and discoveries: 1. The Tesla Transformer. This apparatus is, in the production of electrical vibrations, as revolutionary as http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (16 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. gunpowder was in warfare. Currents many times stronger than any ever generated in the usual ways, and sparks over 100 feet long have been produced by the inventor with an instrument of this kind. 2. The Magnifying Transmitter. This is Tesla's best invention--a peculiar transformer specially adapted to excite the Earth, which is in the transmission of electrical energy what the telescope is in astronomical observation. By the use of this marvelous device he has already set up electrical movements of greater intensity than those of lightning and passed a current, sufficient to light more than 200 incandescent lamps, around the Globe. 3. The Tesla Wireless System. This system comprises a number of improvements and is the only means known for transmitting economically electrical energy to a distance without wires. Careful tests and measurements in connection with an experimental station of great activity, erected by the inventor in Colorado, have demonstrated that power in any desired amount can be conveyed clear across the Globe if necessary, with a loss not exceeding a few per cent. 4. The Art of Individualization. This invention of Tesla is to primitive tuning what refined language is to unarticulated expression. It makes possible the transmission of signals or messages absolutely secret and exclusive both in active and passive aspect, that is, non-interfering as well as non-interferable. Each signal is like an individual of unmistakable identity and there is virtually no limit to the number of stations or instruments that can be simultaneously operated without the slightest mutual disturbance. 5. The Terrestrial Stationary Waves. This wonderful discovery, popularly explained, means that the Earth is responsive to electrical vibrations of definite pitch just as a tuning fork to certain waves of sound. These particular electrical vibrations, capable of powerfully exciting the Globe, lend themselves to innumerable uses of great importance commercially and in many other respects. The first World System power plant can be put in operation in nine months. With this power plant it will be practical to attain electrical activities up to ten million horsepower and it is designed to serve for as many technical achievements as are possible without undue expense. Among these the following may be mentioned: 1. Interconnection of the existing telegraph exchanges of offices all over the World; 2. Establishment of a secret and non-interferable government telegraph service; 3. Interconnection of all the present telephone exchanges or offices all over the Globe; 4. Universal distribution of general news, by telegraph or telephone, in connection with the Press; 5. Establishment of a World System of intelligence transmission for exclusive private use; 6. Interconnection and operation of all stock tickers of the world; 7. Establishment of a world system of musical distribution, etc.; 8. Universal registration of time by cheap clocks indicating the time with astronomical precision and requiring no attention whatever; 9. Facsimile transmission of typed or handwritten characters, letters, checks, etc.; 10. Establishment of a universal marine service enabling navigators of all ships to steer perfectly without compass, to determine the exact location, hour and speed, to prevent collisions and disasters, etc.; 11. Inauguration of a system of world printing on land and sea; 12. Reproduction anywhere in the world of photographic pictures and all kinds of drawings or records. Thus, more than forty years ago, Tesla planned to inaugurate every feature of modern radio, and several facilities which have not yet been developed. He was to continue, for another twenty years, to be the only \"wireless'' inventor who had yet visualized a broadcasting service. While at work on his Wardenclyffe radio-broadcasting plant, Tesla was also evolving plans for establishing his world power station at Niagara Falls. So sure was he of the successful outcome of his efforts that he stated in a newspaper interview in 1903 that he would light the lamps of the coming international exposition in Paris with power wirelessly transmitted from the Falls. Circumstances, however, prevented him from making good this promise. His difficulties and his plans were outlined in a statement published in the Electrical World and Engineer, March 5, 1904: (Below) Compliments: Gary Peterson of 21st Century Books, http://www.tfcbooks.com ; used by permission http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (17 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. Back To INDEX TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY WITHOUT WIRES by Nikola Tesla as communicated to the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Electrical World and Engineer, March 5, 1904 It is impossible to resist your courteous request extended on an occasion of such moment in the life of your journal. Your letter has vivified the memory of our beginning friendship, of the first imperfect attempts and undeserved successes, of kindness and misunderstandings. It has brought painfully to my mind the greatness of early expectations, the quick flight of time, and alas! the smallness of realizations. The following lines which, but for your initiative, might not have been given to the world for a long time yet, are an offering in the friendly spirit of old, and my best wishes for your future success accompany them. Towards the close of 1898 a systematic research, carried on for a number of years with the object of perfecting a method of transmission of electrical energy through the natural medium, led me to recognize three important necessities: First, to develop a transmitter of great power; second, to perfect means for individualizing and isolating the energy transmitted; and, third, to ascertain the laws of propagation of currents through the earth and the atmosphere. Various reasons, not the least of which was the help proffered by my friend Leonard E. Curtis and the Colorado Springs Electric Company, determined me to select for my experimental investigations the large plateau, two thousand meters above sea-level, in the vicinity of that delightful resort, which I reached late in May, 1899. I had not been there but a few days when I congratulated myself on the happy choice and I began the task, for which I had long trained myself, with a grateful sense and full of inspiring hope. The perfect purity of the air, the unequaled beauty of the sky, the imposing sight of a high mountain range, the quiet and restfulness of the place--all around contributed to make the conditions for scientific observations ideal. To this was added the exhilarating influence of a glorious climate and a singular sharpening of the senses. In those regions the organs undergo perceptible physical changes. The eyes assume an extraordinary limpidity, improving vision; the ears dry out and become more susceptible to sound. Objects can be clearly distinguished there at distances such that I prefer to have them told by someone else, and I have heard, this I can venture to vouch for, the claps of thunder seven and eight hundred kilometers away. I might have done better still, had it not been tedious to wait for the sounds to arrive, in definite intervals, as heralded precisely by an electrical indicating apparatus, nearly an hour before. In the middle of June, while preparations for other work were going on, I arranged one of my receiving transformers with the view of determining in a novel manner, experimentally, the electric potential of the globe and studying its periodic and casual fluctuations. This formed part of a plan carefully mapped out in advance. A highly sensitive, self-restorative device, controlling a recording instrument, was included in the secondary circuit, while the primary was connected to the ground and an elevated terminal of adjustable capacity. The variations of potential gave rise to electric surging in the primary; these generated secondary currents, which in turn affected the sensitive device and recorder in proportion to their intensity. The earth was found to be, literally, alive with electrical vibrations, and soon I was deeply absorbed in the interesting investigation. No http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (18 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. better opportunities for such observations as I intended to make could be found anywhere. Colorado is a country famous for the natural displays of electric force. In that dry and rarefied atmosphere the sun's rays beat the objects with fierce intensity. I raised steam, to a dangerous pressure, in barrels filled with concentrated salt solution, and the tinfoil coatings of some of my elevated terminals shriveled up in the fiery blaze. An experimental high-tension transformer, carelessly exposed to the rays of the setting sun, had most of its insulating compound melted out and was rendered useless. Aided by the dryness and rarefaction of the air, the water evaporates as in a boiler, and static electricity is developed in abundance. Lightning discharges are, accordingly, very frequent and sometimes of inconceivable violence. On one occasion approximately twelve thousand discharges occurred in two hours, and all in a radius of certainly less than fifty kilometers from the laboratory. Many of them resembled gigantic trees of fire with the trunks up or down. I never saw fire balls, but as compensation for my disappointment I succeeded later in determining the mode of their formation and producing them artificially. In the latter part of the same month I noticed several times that my instruments were affected stronger by discharges taking place at great distances than by those near by. This puzzled me very much. What was the cause? A number of observations proved that it could not be due to the differences in the intensity of the individual discharges, and I readily ascertained that the phenomenon was not the result of a varying relation between the periods of my receiving circuits and those of the terrestrial disturbances. One night, as I was walking home with an assistant, meditating over these experiences, I was suddenly staggered by a thought. Years ago, when I wrote a chapter of my lecture before the Franklin Institute and the National Electric Light Association, it had presented itself to me, but I dismissed it as absurd and impossible. I banished it again. Nevertheless, my instinct was aroused and somehow I felt that I was nearing a great revelation. It was on the third of July--the date I shall never forget--when I obtained the first decisive experimental evidence of a truth of overwhelming importance for the advancement of humanity. A dense mass of strongly charged clouds gathered in the west and towards the evening a violent storm broke loose which, after spending much of its fury in the mountains, was driven away with great velocity over the plains. Heavy and long persisting arcs formed almost in regular time intervals. My observations were now greatly facilitated and rendered more accurate by the experiences already gained. I was able to handle my instruments quickly and I was prepared. The recording apparatus being properly adjusted, its indications became fainter and fainter with the increasing distance of the storm, until they ceased altogether. I was watching in eager expectation. Surely enough, in a little while the indications again began, grew stronger and stronger and, after passing through a maximum, gradually decreased and ceased once more. Many times, in regularly recurring intervals, the same actions were repeated until the storm which, as evident from simple computations, was moving with nearly constant speed, had retreated to a distance of about three hundred kilometers. Nor did these strange actions stop then, but continued to manifest themselves with undiminished force. Subsequently, similar observations were also made by my assistant, Mr. Fritz Lowenstein, and shortly afterward several admirable opportunities presented themselves which brought out, still more forcibly, and unmistakably, the true nature of the wonderful phenomenon. No doubt, whatever remained: I was observing stationary waves. As the source of disturbances moved away the receiving circuit came successively upon their nodes and loops. Impossible as it seemed, this planet, despite its vast extent, behaved like a conductor of limited dimensions. The tremendous significance of this fact in the transmission of energy by my system had already become quite clear to me. Not only was it practicable to send telegraphic messages to any distance without wires, as I recognized long ago, but also to impress upon the entire globe the faint modulations of the human voice, far more still, to transmit power, in unlimited amounts, to any terrestrial distance and almost without loss. With these stupendous possibilities in sight, and the experimental evidence before me that their realization was henceforth merely a question of expert knowledge, patience and skill, I attacked vigorously the development of my magnifying transmitter, now, however, not so much with the original intention of producing one of great http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (19 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. power, as with the object of learning how to construct the best one. This is, essentially, a circuit of very high self-induction and small resistance which in its arrangement, mode of excitation and action, may be said to be the diametrical opposite of a transmitting circuit typical of telegraphy by Hertzian or electromagnetic radiation. It is difficult to form an adequate idea of the marvelous power of this unique appliance, by the aid of which the globe will be transformed. The electromagnetic radiation being reduced to an insignificant quantity, and proper conditions of resonance maintained, the circuit acts like an immense pendulum, storing indefinitely the energy of the primary exciting impulses and impressions upon the earth of the primary exciting impulses and impressions upon the earth and its conducting atmosphere uniform harmonic oscillations of intensities which, as actual tests have shown, may be pushed so far as to surpass those attained in the natural displays of static electricity. Simultaneously with these endeavors, the means of individualization and isolation were gradually improved. Great importance was attached to this, for it was found that simple tuning was not sufficient to meet the vigorous practical requirements. The fundamental idea of employing a number of distinctive elements, cooperatively associated, for the purpose of isolating energy transmitted, I trace directly to my perusal of Spencer's clear and suggestive exposition of the human nerve mechanism. The influence of this principle on the transmission of intelligence, and electrical energy in general, cannot as yet be estimated, for the art is still in the embryonic stage; but many thousands of simultaneous telegraphic and telephonic messages, through one single conducting channel, natural or artificial, and without serious mutual interference, are certainly practicable, while millions are possible. On the other hand, any desired degree of individualization may be secured by the use of a great number of cooperative elements and arbitrary variation of their distinctive features and order of succession. For obvious reasons, the principle will also be valuable in the extension of the distance of transmission. Progress though of necessity slow was steady and sure, for the objects aimed at were in a direction of my constant study and exercise. It is, therefore, not astonishing that before the end of 1899 I completed the task undertaken and reached the results which I have announced in my article in the Century Magazine of June, 1900, every word of which was carefully weighed. Much has already been done towards making my system commercially available, in the transmission of energy in small amounts for specific purposes, as well as on an industrial scale. The results attained by me have made my scheme of intelligence transmission, for which the name of \"World Telegraphy\" has been suggested, easily realizable. It constitutes, I believe, in its principle of operation, means employed and capacities of application, a radical and fruitful departure from what has been done heretofore. I have no doubt that it will prove very efficient in enlightening the masses, particularly in still uncivilized countries and less accessible regions, and that it will add materially to general safety, comfort and convenience, and maintenance of peaceful relations. It involves the employment of a number of plants, all of which are capable of transmitting individualized signals to the uttermost confines of the earth. Each of them will be preferably located near some important center of civilization and the news it receives through any channel will be flashed to all points of the globe. A cheap and simple device, which might be carried in one's pocket, may then be set up somewhere on sea or land, and it will record the world's news or such special messages as may be intended for it. Thus the entire earth will be converted into a huge brain, as it were, capable of response in every one of its parts. Since a single plant of but one hundred horsepower can operate hundreds of millions of instruments, the system will have a virtually infinite working capacity, and it must needs immensely facilitate and cheapen the transmission of intelligence. \"The first of these central plants would have been already completed had it not been for unforeseen delays which, fortunately, have nothing to do with its purely technical features. But this loss of time, while vexatious, may, after all, prove to be a blessing in disguise. The best design of which I know has been adopted, and the transmitter will emit a wave complex of a total maximum activity of 10,000,000 horsepower, one percent of which is amply sufficient to \"girdle the globe.\" This enormous rate of energy delivery, approximately twice that of the combined falls of Niagara, is obtainable only by the use of certain artifices, which I shall make known in http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (20 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla.

Pierpont Morgan, which was all the more welcome and stimulating, as it was extended at a time when those, who have since promised most, were the greatest of doubters. I have also to thank my friend Stanford White, for much unselfish and valuable assistance. This work is now far advanced, and though the results may be tardy, they are sure to come. Meanwhile, the transmission of energy on an industrial scale is not being neglected. The Canadian Niagara Power Company have offered me a splendid inducement, and next to achieving success for the sake of the art, it will give me the greatest satisfaction to make their concession financially profitable to them. In this first power plant, which I have been designing for a long time, I propose to distribute 10,000 horsepower under a tension of 10,000,000 volts, which I am now able to produce and handle with safety. This energy will be collected all over the globe preferably in small amounts, ranging from a fraction of one to a few horsepower. One of the chief uses will be the illumination of isolated homes. It takes very little power to light a dwelling with vacuum tubes operated by high frequency currents and in each instance a terminal a little above the roof will be sufficient. Another valuable application will be the driving of clocks and other such apparatus. These clocks will be exceedingly simple, will require absolutely no attention and will indicate rigorously correct time. The idea of impressing upon the earth American time is fascinating and very likely to become popular. There are innumerable devices of all kinds which are either now employed or can be supplied and by operating them in this manner I may be able to offer a great convenience to the whole world with a plant of no more than 10,000 horsepower. The introduction of this system will give opportunities for invention and manufacture such as have never presented themselves before. Knowing the far reaching importance of this first attempt and its effect upon future development, I shall proceed slowly and carefully. Experience has taught me not to assign a term to enterprises the consummation of which is not wholly dependent on my own abilities and exertions. But I am hopeful that these great realizations are not far off and I know that when this first work is completed they will follow with mathematical certitude. When the great truth accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed is fully recognized, that this planet, with all its appalling immensity, is to electric current virtually no more than a small metal ball and that by this fact many possibilities, each baffling the imagination and of incalculable consequence, are rendered absolutely sure of accomplishment; when the first plant is inaugurated, and it is shown that a telegraphic message, almost as secret and non-interferable as a thought, can be transmitted to any terrestrial distance, the sound of the human voice, with all its intonations and injections, faithfully and instantly reproduced at any point of the globe, the energy of a waterfall made available for supplying light, heat or motive power, anywhere on sea, or land, or high in the air...humanity will be like an ant heap stirred up with a stick: See the excitement coming. \" -End- Summation: The Niagara Falls plant was never built; and difficulties, soon enough, were encountered at the Wardenclyffe plant not only in securing desired equipment but also finances. Tesla's greatest oversight was that he neglected to invent, so to speak, a device for making the unlimited quantities of money that were necessary to develop his other inventions. As we have seen, he was utterly lacking in the phase of personality that made possible the securing of financial returns directly from his inventions. An individual with his ability could have made millions out of each of a number of Tesla's minor inventions. If he had taken the trouble, for example, to collect annual royalties on twenty or more different kinds of devices put out by as many manufacturers employing his Tesla coil for medical treatments, he would have had ample income to finance his World Wireless System. http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (21 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla.

Armed guards were always stationed around the laboratory to prevent spying on his inventions. His payroll was heavy, his bank balance became dangerously low, but he was so immersed in his experimental work that he continuously put off the task of making an effort to repair his finances. He soon found himself facing judgments obtained by creditors on accounts upon which he could not make payments. He was forced, in 1905, to close the Wardenclyffe laboratory... The fantastic tower in front of the laboratory was never completed. The doughnut-shaped copper electrode was never built because Tesla changed his mind and decided to have a copper hemisphere 100 feet in diameter and 50 feet high built on top of the 154-foot cone-shaped tower. A skeleton framework for holding the hemispherical plates was built, but the copper sheeting was never applied to it. The 300-horsepower dynamos and the apparatus for operating the broadcasting station were left intact, but they were eventually removed by the engineering firm that installed them and had not been paid. \"Prodigal Genius. by, John O'Neil\" excerpt.

Tesla's Earthquake Machine Excerpt from the New York World Telegram, July 11, 1935 - Nikola Tesla revealed that an earthquake which drew police and ambulances to the region of his laboratory at 48 E. Houston St., New York, in 1898, was the result of a little machine he was experimenting with at the time which \"you could put in your overcoat pocket.\" The bewildered newspapermen pounced upon this as at least one thing they could understand and \"the father of modern electricity\" told what had happened as follows: \"I was experimenting with vibrations. I had one of my machines going and I wanted to see if I could get it in tune with the vibration of the building. I put it up notch after notch. There was a peculiar cracking sound. \"I asked my assistants where did the sound come from. They did not know. I put the machine up a few more notches. There was a louder cracking sound. I knew I was approaching the vibration of the steel building. I pushed the machine a little higher. \"Suddenly all the heavy machinery in the place was flying around. I grabbed a hammer and broke the machine. The building would have been about our ears in another few minutes. Outside in the street there was pandemonium. \"The police and ambulances arrived. I told my assistants to say nothing. We told the police it must have been an earthquake. That's all they ever knew about it.\" Some shrewd reporter asked Dr. Tesla at this point what he would need to destroy the Empire State Building and the doctor replied: \"Vibration will do anything. It would only be necessary to step up the vibrations of the machine to fit the natural vibration of the building and the building would come crashing down. That's why soldiers break step crossing a bridge.\" His early experiments in vibration, he explained, led to his invention of his \"earth vibrating\" machine.

Cosmic ray investigation is a subject that is very close to me. I was the first to discover these rays and I naturally feel toward them as I would toward my own flesh and blood. I have advanced a theory of the cosmic rays and at every step of my investigations I have found it completely justified. The attractive features of the cosmic rays is their constancy. They shower down on us throughout the whole 24 hours, and if a plant is developed to use their power it will not require devices for storing energy as would be necessary with devices using wind, tide or sunlight. All of my investigations seem to point to the conclusion that they are small particles, each carrying so small a charge that we are justified in calling them neutrons. They move with great velocity, exceeding that of light. More than 25 years ago I began my efforts to harness the cosmic rays and I can now state that I have http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (23 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:06 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. succeeded in operating a motive device by means of them. I will tell you in the most general way, the cosmic ray ionizes the air, setting free many charges ions and electrons. These charges are captured in a condenser which is made to discharge through the circuit of the motor. I have hopes of building my motor on a large scale, but circumstances have not been favorable to carrying out my plan. Device to Harness Cosmic Energy Claimed by Tesla: New York American November 1st, 1933 \"This new power for the driving of the world's machinery will be derived from the energy which operates the universe, the cosmic energy, whose central source for the earth is the sun and which is everywhere present in unlimited quantities.\" This is a diagram of Tesla's first radiant energy receiver. It stored static electricity obtained from the air and converted it to a usable form. Tesla's invention is a simple version of T.H. Moray's device. Moray's device used a unique rectifier (RE-valve) to efficiently capture the static electricity from the surrounding air. Moray's oscillator tubes (magnetron transducers) utilized this high-voltage energy to generate an internal secondary \"cold\" fusion reaction. Stick an antenna up in the air, the higher the better, and wire it to one side of a capacitor, the other going to a good earth ground, and the potential difference will then charge the capacitor. Connect across the capacitor some sort of switching device so that it can be discharged at rhythmic intervals, and you have an oscillating electric output. T.H. Moray simply expanded on Tesla's idea to use high-voltage to create ionic oscillation. Tesla's free-energy concept was patented in 1901 as an \"Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy.\" The patent refers to \"the sun, as well as other sources of radiant energy, like cosmic rays,\" that the device works at night is explained in terms of the nighttime availability of cosmic rays. Tesla also refers to the ground as \"a vast reservoir of negative electricity.\" Tesla was fascinated by radiant energy and its free-energy possibilities. He called the Crooke's radiometer, a device which has vanes that spin in a vacuum when exposed to radiant energy \"a beautiful invention.\" He believed that it would become possible to harness energy directly by \"connecting to the very wheel-work of nature.\" On his 76th birthday at his yearly ritual press conference, Tesla announced a \"cosmic-ray motor\" when asked if it was more powerful than the Crooke's radiometer, he answered, \"thousands of times more powerful.\" In 1901 Nikola Tesla was one the first to identify \"radiant energy.\" Tesla says that the source of this energy is our Sun. He concluded that the Sun emits small particles, each carrying so small of a charge, that they move with great velocity, exceeding that of light. Tesla further states that these particles are the neutron particles. Tesla believed that these neutron particles were responsible for all radioactive reactions. Radiant matter is in tune with these neutron particles. Radiant matter is simply a re-transmitter of energy from one state to another. How his radiant energy receiver worked: From the electric Potential that exists between the elevated plate (plus) and the ground (minus), energy builds up in the capacitor, and, after \"a suitable time interval,\" the accumulated energy will \"manifest itself in a powerful discharge\" that can do work. The capacitor, says Tesla, should be \"of considerable electrostatic capacity,\" and its dielectric made of \"the best quality mica, for it has to withstand potentials that could rupture a weaker dielectric.\" http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (24 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:07 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. Tesla gives various options for the switching device. One is a rotary switch that resembles a Tesla circuit controller, another is an electrostatic device consisting of two very light, membranous conductors suspended in a vacuum. These sense the energy buildup in the capacitor, one charging positive, the other negative, and, at a certain charge level, are attracted, touch, and thus fire the capacitor. Tesla also mentions another switching device consisting of a minute air gap or weak dielectric film that breaks down suddenly when a certain potential is reached. Tesla received two patents for this radiant energy device, \"Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy,\" number 685,957, that was filed for on March 21, 1901 and granted on November 5, 1901. The other, \"Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy,\" number 685,957, that was filed for on March 21, 1901 and was granted on November 5, 1901. In these patents he explains: \"The sun, as well as other sources of radiant energy throw off minute particles of matter positively electrified, which, impinging upon the upper plate, communicate continuously an electrical charge to the same. The opposite terminal of the condenser being connected to ground, which may be considered as a vast reservoir of negative electricity, a feeble current flows continuously into the condenser and inasmuch as the particles are charged to a very high potential, this charging of the condenser may continue, as I have actually observed, almost indefinitely, even to the point of rupturing the dielectric.\" The Earth's Electrostatic Charge Tesla's intent was to condense the energy trapped between the earth and its upper atmosphere and to transform it into an electric current. He pictured the sun as an immense ball of electricity, positively charged with a potential of some 200 billion volts. The earth, on the other hand, is charged with negative electricity. The tremendous electrical force between these two bodies constituted, at least in part, what he called cosmic energy. It varied from night to day and from season to season but it is always present. The positive particles are stopped at the ionosphere and between it and the negative charges in the ground, a distance of 60 miles, there is a large difference of voltage - something on the order of 360,000 volts. With the gases of the atmosphere acting as an insulator between these two opposite stores of electrical charges, the region between the ground and the edge of space traps a great deal of energy. Despite the large size of the planet, it is electrically like a capacitor which keeps positive and negative charges apart by using the air as a non-conducting material as an insulator. The earth has a charge of 96,500 coulombs. With a potential of 360,000 volts, the earth constitutes a capacitor of .25 farads (farads = coulombs/volts). If the formula for calculating the energy stored in a capacitor (E =1/2CV2) is applied to the earth, it turns out that the ambient medium contains 1.6 x 1011 joules or 4.5 megawatt-hours of electrical energy. In order to utilize this high-voltage energy you must do two things -- make an energy sink and then devise a way of making the \"sink\" oscillate. \"Zero-Point Energy?\" Such a \"sink\" has to be at a lower energy state than the surrounding medium and, for the energy to continually flow into it, the energy must be continually pumped out of it. Additionally, this \"sink\" must maintain a lower energy state while meeting the power requirements of the load attached to it. Electrical energy, watt-seconds, is a product of volts x amps x seconds. Because the period of oscillation does not change, either voltage or current has to be the variable in this system's energy equation. Bifilar wound coils are used in the system because a bifilar wound coil maximizes the voltage difference between its turns, the current is then minimized. A coil in our system, then, will be set into oscillation at its resonant frequency by an external power source. During the \"zero-point\" portion of its cycle the coil will appear as one plate of a capacitor. As the voltage across the coil increases, the amount of charge it can siphon will increase. The energy that is taken into the coil http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (25 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:07 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla. The Complete Tesla. through the small energy window (zero-point), call it what you will, appears to be the key to the success of this system. It is at this zero-point where energy is condensed into positive and negative components of current. When energy escapes from the \"sink\" the magnetic field collapses and a strong magnetic quake is created in it's wake. A properly tuned system can capture and convert radiant energy in such a prescribed arrangement. Energy Directly from the Atom The radiant energy system is a self-oscillating capacitive system. Once it is set into oscillation, very little power is expended in keeping it going. Because it is an electrostatic oscillating system, only a small amount of charge moves through the system per cycle, that is, the coulomb per seconds = amps are low. If the charge is used at a low rate, the energy stored in the system will be turned into heat at a slow rate enabling the oscillations to continue for a long period of time. Tesla's \"COIL FOR ELECTRO MAGNETS,\" patent #512,340 is a very special coil design because, unlike an ordinary coil made by turning wire on a tube form, this one uses two wires laid next to each other on a form but with the end of the first one connected to the beginning of the second one. In this patent Tesla explains that the double coil will store many times the energy of a conventional coil.[1] Measurements of two coils of the same size and with the same number of turns, one with a single, the other with a bifilar winding, show differences in voltage gain. These bifilar Tesla's coils can be explained solely on the basis of their electrical activity. A bifilar coil is capable of holding more charge than a single wound coil. When operated at resonance, the distributed capacitance of the bifilar coil is able to overcome the counter - electromotive force (e.m.f.) normal to coils, inductive reactance. Because of the electrical activity, a bifilar coil does not work against itself in the form of a counter - e.m.f., the potential across the coil quickly builds to a high value. The difference between the turns becomes great enough that the energy is practically all potential, at this point, the system becomes an electrostatic oscillator. Minimal work is done in my radiant energy system due to the absence of wasted displacement currents. As small heat losses occur, oscillations are maintained by surplus charge generated by atomic catalytic reactions, energy is siphoned from the kinetic moments of these charges. Very low energy expenditure allows power delivery to an electrical load over an extended time period without an external fuel supply. After an initial input of energy from an outside source, the radiant energy electrical generator will operate as a very efficient device. By reviewing history it is understandable why some inventions are not commercialized. It is economics, not science, that is the main factor. It will be remembered that alternating current was opposed by powerful financiers in Tesla's time. Michael Pupin, noted in his autobiography: \"...captains of industry...who were afraid that they would have to scrap some of their direct current apparatus and the plants for manufacturing it, if the alternating current system received any support. A most un-American attitude...but ignorance and false notions prevailed in the early nineties, because the captains of electrical industries paid small attention to highly trained scientists.\"[2] Philadelphia Public Ledger November 2, 1933: Tesla 'Harnesses' Cosmic Energy Inventor announces discovery to displace fuel in driving machinery. Calls Sun main source. A principle by which power for driving machinery of the world may be developed from the cosmic energy which operates the universe, has been discovered by Nikola Tesla, noted physicist and inventor of scientific devices, he announced today. This principle, which taps a source of power described as \"everywhere present in unlimited quantities\" and which may be transmitted by wire or wireless from central plants to any part of the globe, will eliminate the need of coal, oil, gas or any other of the common fuels, he said. Dr. Tesla in a statement today at his hotel indicated the time was not far distant when the principle would be http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (26 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:07 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla.

Asked whether the sudden introduction of his principle would upset the present economic system, Dr. Tesla replied, \"It is badly upset already.\" He added that now as never before was the time ripe for the development of new resources. While in its present form, the theory calls for the development of energy in central plants requiring vast machinery. Dr. Tesla said he might be able to work out a plan for its use by individuals. The central source of cosmic energy for the earth is the Sun, Dr. Tesla said, but \"night will not interrupt the flow of new power supply.\" Clearly Tesla is not talking about an atomic reactor. He is directly converting ionized particles generated by radiant matter. It is not nuclear energy as we know it today. Radiant Energy is directly converted to electrical power! Tesla believed that the Sun generates highly charged particles and that radiant matter is a re- transmitter of energy, it is this transfer of energy that could be used for practical purposes. To continue the journey through the amazing life of Nikola Tesla, let's see what Tesla himself had predicted for our time: Please click on these links [ The Wonder World To Be Created By Electricity ] and [ A Machine To End War ] [ The Lost Inventions of Nikola Tesla] Back To INDEX Help Frank Germano References : [1] Nikola Tesla, U.S. Patent #512,340, \"COIL FOR ELECTRO MAGNETS,\" he explains that a standard coil of 1000 turns with a potential of 100 volts across it will have a difference of .1 volt between turns. A similar bifilar coil will have a potential of 50 volts between turns. In that the stored energy is a function of the square of the voltages the energy in the bifilar will be 502/.12 = 2500/.01 = 250,000 times greater than the standard coil.

The ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of human nature to human needs. Of all the frictional resistance, the one that most retards human movement is ignorance, what Buddha called \"the greatest evil in the world.\" The friction which results from ignorance can be reduced only by the spread of knowledge and the unification of the heterogeneous elements of humanity. No effort could be better spent. Universal peace as a result of cumulative effort through centuries past might come into existence quickly -- not unlike a crystal that suddenly forms in a solution which has been slowly prepared.

Yet, no fiercer adversary could have been found when aroused. Westinghouse welcomed the struggle and never lost confidence. When others would give up in despair, he triumphed. The last 29 days of the month [are] the hardest. No matter what we attempt to do, no matter to what fields we turn our efforts, we are dependent on power. We have to evolve means of obtaining energy from stores which are forever inexhaustible, to perfect methods which do not imply consumption and waste of any material whatever. If we use fuel to get our power, we are living on our capital and exhausting it rapidly. This method is barbarous and wantonly wasteful and will have to be stopped in the interest of coming generations. The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of a planter -- for the future. His duty is to lay foundation of those who are to come and point the way. Even matter called inorganic, believed to be dead, responds to irritants and gives unmistakable evidence of a living principle within. Everything that exists, organic or inorganic, animated or inert, is susceptible to stimulus from the outside. Science is but a perversion of itself unless it has as its ultimate goal the betterment of humanity. We are confronted with portentous problems which can not be solved just by providing for our material existence, however abundantly. On the contrary, progress in this direction is fraught with hazards and perils not less menacing than those born from want and suffering. If we were to release the energy of the atoms or discover some other way of developing cheap and unlimited power at any point of the globe this accomplishment, instead of being a blessing, might bring disaster to mankind... The greatest good will come from the technical improvements tending to unification and harmony, and my wireless transmitter is preeminently such. By its means the human voice and likeness will be reproduced everywhere and factories driven thousands of miles from waterfalls furnishing the power; aerial machines will be propelled around the earth without a stop and the sun's energy controlled to create lakes and rivers for motive purposes and transformation of arid deserts into fertile land...

In our dynamo machines, it is well known, we generate alternate currents which we direct by means of a commutator, a complicated device and, it may be justly said, the source of most of the troubles experienced in the operation of the machines. Now, the currents, so directed cannot be utilized in the motor, but must - again by means of a similar unreliable device - be reconverted into their original state of alternate currents. The function of the commutator is entirely external, and in no way does it affect the internal workings of the machines.

In view simply of this fact, alternate currents would commend themselves as a more direct application of electrical energy, and the employment of continuous currents would only be justified if we had dynamos which would primarily generate, and motors which would be directly actuated by, such currents. (Adopted from T.C. Martin, \"The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla,\" New Work: Electrical Engineer, 1894, pp. 9-11.) On George Westinghouse: George Westinghouse was, in my opinion, the only man on this globe who could take my alternating-current system under the circumstances then existing and win the battle against prejudice and money power. He was a pioneer of imposing stature, one of the world's true nobleman of whom America may well be proud and to whom humanity owes an immense debt of gratitude. (Speech, Institute of Immigrant Welfare, Hotel Baltimore, New York, May 12, 1938, read in absentia.) On Edison: If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack, he would proceed at once with the diligence of the bee to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search. ... I was a sorry witness of such doings, knowing that a little theory and calculation would have saved him ninety per cent of his labor. (New York Times, October 19, 1931.) On Voltaire: I had a veritable mania for finishing whatever I began, which often got me into difficulties. On one occasion I started to read the works of Voltaire when I learned, to my dismay, that there were close on one hundred large volumes in small print which that monster had written while drinking seventy-two cups of black coffee per diem. It had to be done, but when I laid aside the last book I was very glad, and said, \"Never more! (Nikola Tesla, \"My Inventions: the autobiography of Nikola Tesla\", Hart Bros., 1982. Originally appeared in the Electrical experimenter magazine in 1919.) On Mark Twain: I had hardly completed my course at the Real Gymnasium when I was prostrated with a dangerous illness or rather, a score of them, and my condition became so desperate that I was given up by physicians. During this period I was permitted to read constantly, obtaining books from the Public Library which had been neglected and entrusted to me for classification of the works and preparation of the catalogues. One day I was handed a few volumes of new literature unlike anything I had ever read before and so captivating as to make me utterly forget my hopeless state. They were the earlier works of Mark Twain and to them might have been due the miraculous recovery which followed. Twenty-five years later, when I met Mr. Clemens and we formed a friendship between us, I told him of the experience and was amazed to see that great man of laughter burst into tears.

My key reasons for writing the book were to try and answer many of the questions left unanswered by the other authors, such as why Tesla's name dropped into obscurity, whether or not he really received signals from Mars, how his magnifying transmitter really worked, what exactly happened to cause his failure with JP Morgan, what happened to his secret particle beam weaponry papers, and would his particle beam weapon have really worked. The book is set up completely chronologically, and begins with a quote for each chapter. It also differs from the other biographies in a number of other ways mainly because I had access to hundreds of documents which had never been published before, many received through the Freedom of Information Act. For instance, for the first time ever, WIZARD explains why Tesla stopped working for Edison, why Steinmetz dropped Tesla's name from his textbooks on AC power, why Michael Pupin never mentioned Tesla's name in his physics courses at Columbia University, how Tesla pre-dated Rutherford, Bohr and Einstein in theories on the structure of the atom and on what came to be called Quantum physics, how Marconi pirated Tesla's apparatus, why Tesla had a falling out with his editor TC Martin, John Jacob Astor, JP Morgan and John Hayes Hammond Jr, what Tesla's link to the Navy was, how Franklin Roosevelt used the Tesla patents to block payments on wireless apparatus to Marconi, yet at the same time cut Tesla out of the Marconi/Sarnoff/Westinghouse deal to create RCA, how Tesla interacted with Telefunken, the German wireless concern during WWI and the US War Department during WWII to help them design a particle beam weapon, and how and why Tesla's name has been picked up by cult circles.

Nikola Tesla's Earthquake Machine ~ Usually ships in 24 hours Dale Pond, et al / Paperback / Published 1995 Our Price: $16.95Reviews : Book Description In 1935, Nikola Tesla revealed that an earthquake in the region of his New York laboratory in 1898 was the result of a machine he had been experimenting with. This book presents his technology based on sonic vibrations. Now for the first time the secrets of the Tesla Oscillator are available to both the layman and advanced researcher. INTRODUCTION: ,This manual presents a new technology. It is based on SONIC VIBRATIONS which can be produced by a comparatively simple apparatus. Although sonic vibrations can be similar in their effects and in their wave mechanics like electro-magnetic oscillations, the writer has good reason to believe that this proposed system is fundamentally different in so far as the MANNER OF PRODUCTION of sonic vibrations is concerned. There is much sonic equipment available now on the market for different purposes. It all has nothing to do with the system in this manual. In the oscillators or transmitters described in this report, a RESONANCE EFFECT can be observed. Since resonance appears to be an ever expanding, magnifying effect with these transmitters, to the extent that they would self destruct the apparatus if uncontrolled, it can be deduced that there must be a great source of energy available to them. The very opposite is the truth of the matter however - very little input energy is required to set the device in motion and build that motion to tremendous levels of useable energy. The principle employed is called \"Amplitude Modulation Additive Synthesis\" by the music industry engineers. We have included a full chapter on the vibration physics to explain what happens and how. With a few simple formulas and a few basic concepts the writers propose to show why certain resonance effects concerning this type of apparatus go on ever increasing in amplitude. Many measurements have yet to be performed by qualified and competent engineers in their different fields of expertise to derive a complete understand of the http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm (30 of 32) [10/02/03 10:20:07 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Nikola Tesla.

Much experimentation has been done with the sonic transmitters by Nikola Tesla from whom some of the basic principles have been taken by the writers and further elaborated on. Many of Tesla's earlier experiments have been repeated and we believe that it is he who deserves the credit for having discovered these very fundamental principles of the device and its functions. Further elaboration has been brought in from John Keely's work with the fundamental principles of vibration physics and from a number of conventional sources dealing with vibration, sound and noise fundamentals. In modern times sound and vibration are being used more and more. The physics of these forces are becoming more known and useable. Sound is a rich source of energies and forces not completely understood and harnessed yet.

Tesla was famous at the turn of the century for inventing the alternating current system still in use today. But his later inventions, documented in some 30 U.S. patents between 1890 and 1921, have never been utilized as Tesla intended despite their obvious potential for advancing in fundamental ways the technology of modern civilization. Among these lost inventions: the disk-turbine rotary engine, the Tesla coil, electric energy magnifier, high-frequency lighting systems, the magnifying transmitter, wireless power, and the free-energy receiver. Born Yugoslavia, 1956. Educated at the polytechnic school at Graz and at University of Prague. Worked as telephone engineer in Prague and Paris. Conceived new type of electric motor having no commutator, as direct current. motors have, but works on principle of rotating magnetic field produced by poly phase alternating currents. Constructed prototype. Found nobody interested in Europe. Emigrated to U.S. (1884). Worked briefly and unhappily with Thomas Edison. Established own lab and obtained patents on poly phase motors, dynamos, transformers for a complete alternating current power system. Formed alliance with George Westinghouse, who bought poly phase patents for $1 million plus royalty. With Westinghouse, engaged in struggle against Edison to convince public of efficiency and safety of AC over DC, and succeeded in getting Alternating Current accepted as the electric power system worldwide. Also with Westinghouse, lit the Chicago World's Fair, built Niagara Falls hydropower plant, and installed AC - Alternating Current - systems at Colorado silver mines, and other industries. By turn of the century was lifted to celebrity status comparable to Edison's as media promoted him along with the expanding electric power industry. Experimenting independently in Manhattan lab, developed and patented electric devices based on superior capabilities of high-potential, high-frequency currents: Tesla coil, radio, high-frequency lighting, x-rays, electrotherapy. Suffered lab fire. Rebuilt, and continued. Moved lab to Colorado Springs for about one year (1899). Built huge magnifying transmitter. Experimented with wireless power, radio, and earth resonance. Studied lightning. Created lightning. Returned to New York. With encouragement of financier J.P. Morgan, promoted a World System of radio broadcasting utilizing magnifying transmitters. Built huge tower for magnifying transmitter at Wardenclyffe, Long Island as first station in World System. Received enough from Morgan to bring station within sight of completion, then funds cut off, project collapsed. Continued to invent into the 1920's, but flow of patents meager compared to earlier torrent, which amounted to some 700 patents worldwide. High-frequency inventions ignored by established technology, as were disk turbine, free energy receiver, and other inventions. Shut out by media except for birthday press conferences. At these conferences, predicted microwaves, TV, beam technologies, cosmic-ray motor, interplanetary communications, and wave-interference devices that since have been named the Tesla howitzer and the Tesla shield. In the 1930's, he was involved in wireless power projects in Quebec. Last birthday media appearance in 1940. Died privately and peacefully at 87 in New York hotel room from no apparent cause in particular. Personal papers, including copious lab notes, impounded by U.S. Government, surfaced many years later at the \"Tesla Museum\", in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Of these notes, only a fragment, \"Colorado Springs Notes\", has been published by the Museum. the inventions: 1. Disk-Turbine Rotary Engine http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (1 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla Tesla called it a powerhouse in a hat. One version developed 110 h.p. at 5000 RPM and was less than ten inches in diameter. Tesla believed larger turbines could achieve 1000 HP. The disk-turbine rotary engine runs vibration free. It is cheap to manufacture because nothing but the rotor bearings needs to be fitted to close tolerances. It requires little maintenance. If necessary, the rotor can be replaced with ease. The turbine can run on steam, compressed air, gasoline, or oil. How it works Unlike conventional turbines that use blades or buckets to catch the flow, Tesla's uses a set of rigid metal disks that, instead of battling the propelling stream at steep angles, runs with smooth efficiency in parallel with the flow. What drives the disks is a peculiar adhesion that exists between the surface of a body and any moving fluid. This adhesion, is, in Tesla's words, caused by the shock of the fluid against the asperities of the solid substance (simple resistance) and from internal forces opposing molecular separation (a sticking phenomenon). The propellant enters the intake and is directed through a nozzle onto the disks at their perimeter. It travels over the spinning disks in a spiral fashion, exiting at the disks' central openings and is exhausted from the casing. Tesla notes in his patent that, in an engine driven by a fluid, changes in the velocity and direction of movement of the fluid should be as gradual as possible. This, he observes, is not the case, though, in existing engines where sudden changes, shocks, and vibrations are unavoidable. The use of pistons, paddles, vanes and blades, notes Tesla, necessarily introduces numerous defects and limitations and adds to the complication, cost of production, and maintenance of the machines. We who are stuck with the piston engine know this all too well. The Tesla turbine is vibration-free because the propelling fluid moves in natural paths or stream lines of least resistance, free from constraint and disturbance. Conducting the propellant through the intake valve on the other side easily reverses the turbine. Internal combustion A hollow casting is bolted to the top of the turbine for the internal combustion mode. A glow plug or spark plug screws into the top of this chamber. Sticking out of the sides are the intake valves. Interesting thing about these valves, there are no moving parts. They work on a fluidic principle. The Tesla turbines' only moving part is its rotor. Imagine, a powerful internal combustion engine with only one moving part. Fluidics The fluidic valve, which Tesla calls a valvular conduit, allows easy flow in one direction but in the other the flow gets hung up in dead-end chambers (buckets) where it gets spun around 360 degrees, thus forming eddies, or countercurrents that stop the flow as surely as if a mechanical valve were moved into the shut position. The spinning rotor creates plenty of suction to pull fuel and air into the combustion chamber. Tesla notes that after a short lapse of time the chamber becomes heated to such a degree that the ignition device may be shut off without disturbing the established regime. In other words; it diesels. The disk-turbine motor principle in reverse becomes a very efficient pump. (Tesla's Patent No. 1,061,142) Fluid drive The disk turbine principle is employed in the speedometer, which presents the problem of having to turn the rotary motion of a vehicles wheels to angular motion in order to push a spring-loaded indicator needle over a short arc. Tesla's solution: the speedometer cable connects to a disk which spins in interface with a second disk, imparting spin to the fluid in between and, hence, to the second disk which moves the needle. Interface two disks of different sizes in a fluid medium and any desired ratio between speeds of rotation may be obtained http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (2 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla by proper selection of the diameters of the disks, observes Tesla in his patent, thus anticipating in 1911 the fluid-drive automatic transmission. Tesla First worked on his turbine early in his career, believing it would be a good prime mover for his alternating-current dynamos, far superior to the reciprocal steam engines that were the workhorses of that era. But he did not get down to perfecting and patenting it until after the collapse of his global broadcasting scheme (1909). By this time the internal-combustion piston engine was firmly rooted in Western power mechanics. Tesla referred to organized opposition to his attempts to introduce the superior engine, and so have others who have made the attempt since. But Tesla still saw a glorious future for his turbine. To his friend, Yale engineering professor Charles Scott, Tesla predicted, \"My turbine will scrap all the heat engines in the world.\" Replied Scott, \"That would make quite a pile of scrap.\" 2. Spark-Gap Oscillator: Tesla was central in establishing the 60 cycle alternating current power system still in use today. Yet he suspected that the more striking phenomena resided in the higher frequencies of electric vibration. To reach these heights, he first tried dynamos spun at higher speeds and having a greater number of poles than any that had existed before. One having as an armature a flat, radially grooved copper disk achieved 30,000 cycles, but Tesla wanted to go into the millions of cycles. It occurred to him that this vibratory capability was to be found in the capacitor. With a capacitor circuit, the spark-gap oscillator, he did indeed achieve the higher frequencies, and he did so by non mechanical means. The circuit was promising enough for him to patent it as A Method of and Apparatus for Electrical Conversion and Distribution, for Tesla saw in it the possibility of a whole new system of electric lighting by means of high frequencies. Though it was quickly succeeded by the Tesla coil and is not numbered among the more famous of the lost inventions, the spark-gap oscillator is pivotal for Tesla as the invention that launched him into his career in high frequencies. How it works The capacitor. There are only a few basic building blocks of electrical circuitry. The capacitor is one of them. Tesla didn't invent it, it had been around for some time, arguably for millennia, but he did improve upon it in three of his patents. Also called condenser, the common capacitor is just a sandwich of conductive and nonconductive layers that serves the purpose of storing electrical charge. The simplest capacitor has just two conductive sheets separated by a single sheet of insulation. In the capacitor shown, the conductive elements are two metal plates. The insulation between them is oil. In the official vocabulary, the plates are indeed called plates and the insulative layer (oil, glass, mica, or whatever) is called the dielectric. Connect the two terminals of a capacitor into a circuit where there is plus-minus electrical potential, and charge builds on the plates, positive on one, negative on the other. Let this charge build for a while, and then connect the two plates through some resistance, a coil, say, and the capacitor discharges very suddenly. Tesla said, The explosion of dynamite is only the breath of a consumptive compared with its discharge. He went on to say that the capacitor is the means of producing the strongest current, the highest electrical pressure, the greatest commotion in the medium. The capacitor's discharge is not necessarily a single event. If it discharges into a suitable resistance, there is a rush of current outward, then back again, as if it were bouncing off the resistance, then out, and back and so forth until it peters out. The discharge is oscillatory, a vibration. The vibration can be sustained by recharging the capacitor at appropriate intervals. When Tesla talks of the capacitor's discharge causing commotion in the medium, he means a vibration or mix of vibrations. The character of this vibration is determined in part by the capacity of the capacitor, that is, how much charge it will hold. This is a function of it size, the distance between plates, and the composition of the dielectric. Upon discharge there would be, typically, a fundamental vibration, http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (3 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla some harmonics, and perhaps other commotion, maybe musical, maybe not. Additional circuitry can tame the vibration to a pure tone. The medium When Tesla speaks of commotion in the medium, what is the medium? In Tesla's time it was an article of faith that there existed a unified field that permeated all being called the ether. The ether as the electric medium still is an article of faith in some circles, but in official science its existence is presumed to have been disproved in the laboratory. Nevertheless, this conviction about an ether ran very deep, not only among scientists but among all thinkers, until only about forty-some years ago when particle theory, E=MC 2 , and, finally Hiroshima firmly established the new faith. Tesla said the electron did not exist. The materialistic concept of these little particles running through conductors is alien to Tesla electric theory. Here is the Quaker writer Rufus Jones on the ether in 1920: An intangible substance which we call ether - luminiferous (light-bearing) aether - fills all space, even the space occupied by visible objects, and this ether which is capable of amazing vibrations, billions of times a second, is set vibrating at different velocities by different objects. These vibrations bombard the minute rods of the retina... It is responsible also for all the immensely varied phenomena of electricity, probably, too of cohesion and gravitation... The dynamo and the other electrical mechanisms, which we have invented do not make or create electricity. They merely let it come through, showing itself now as light, now as heat, now again as motive power. But always it was there before, unnoted, merely potential, and yet a vast surrounding ocean of energy there behind, ready to break into active operation when the medium was at hand for it. Jones, who was not a scientist but a religious thinker and communicator, was making a point about the nearness of God's power and could do so by invoking the physics of his time. This would be difficult using the Einsteinian physics in fashion today, which W. Gordon Allen has called atheistic science. Although the ether is intangible, it is assumed to have elastic properties, so that Tesla can say a circuit with a large capacity behaves as a slack spring, whereas one with a small capacity acts as a stiff spring vibrating more vigorously. This elastic character of the ether, which you experience palpably when you play with a pair of magnets, is due to the medium's lust for equilibrium. Distorted by electrical charge (or by magnetism or by the gravity of a material body), the ether seeks to restore a perfect balance between the polarities of positive- negative, plus/minus, yang/yin. Voltage is the measure of ether strain or imbalance, called potential difference, or just potential. Balance is not restored from this strained condition in one swing-back. As we have seen with the capacitor, the disturbed electric medium, like a plucked guitar string, over-swings the centerline of equilibrium to one side, then to the other, again and again, and this we know as vibration. In this way of looking at nature, vibration is energy; energy is vibration. So you could say that the commotion in the medium caused by the capacitors discharge is energy itself. Thus, you can speak of the capacitor as an energy magnifier. Even though a feeble potential may charge it, the sudden blast of the capacitor's release plucks the medium mightily. The capacitor is common in modern circuitry, but Tesla used it with much greater emphasis on its capability as an energy magnifier and on a scale almost unheard of today. It's difficult to find commercial capacitors that meet Tesla specifications. Builders of tesla coils and other high-voltage devices usually must construct their own capacitors. Fortunately, this can be done using readily available materials. How it works The spark gap: A simple way to discharge a capacitor is through a spark gap. The spark-gap oscillator is just a capacitor firing into a circuit load (lamps or whatever) through the spark gap. The opening between the spark- http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (4 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla gap electrodes determines when the capacitor will fire. This setting is one determinant of the frequency of the circuit. The others are capacity and the reactance, or bounce characteristics, of the load. The potential needed to bridge the gap is in the tens of thousands of volts. It takes a potential of about 20,000 volts to break down the resistance of just a quarter of an inch of air. The gap doesn't necessarily have to be air. Tesla has referred to a gap consisting of a film of insulation. A spark gap is a switching device, a semiconductor in fact. But the spark gap is problematic, particularly the common two-electrode air-gap version. Heating and ionizing of the air cause irregularities in conduction and premature firing. This arcing must be quenched. It can be to a great degree by using a series of small gaps instead of one larger one, or by using a rotary gap. Tesla also immersed the gap in flowing oil, used an air blowout, and even found that a magnetic field helps to quench. For the gap Tesla substituted high-speed rotary switches, which he called circuit controllers. One has a rotor that dips into a pool of mercury, and another uses mercury jets to make contact. You can operate a spark gap without a capacitor by connecting it directly to a source of sufficient voltage. This is, of course, how our automotive spark plugs work, directly off the coil. (The capacitor in that circuit is used to juice the ignition coil primary.) The auto distributor, incidentally, is a rotary gap, pure Tesla. Early radio amateurs used spark-gap oscillators as transmitters. The capacitor was, more often than not, left out of the circuit, but with it the transmitter could create a greater commotion in the medium. 3. Tesla Coil Tesla's best-known invention takes the spark-gap oscillator and uses it to vibrate vigorously a coil consisting of few turns of heavy conductor. Inside of this primary coil sits another secondary coil with hundreds of turns of slender wire. In the Tesla coil there is no iron core as in the conventional step-up transformer, and this air-core transformer differs radically in other ways. Recounting the birth of this invention, Tesla wrote, Each time the condenser was discharged the current would quiver in the primary wire and induce corresponding oscillations in the secondary. Thus, a transformer or induction coil on new principles was evolved Electrical effects of any desired character and of intensities undreamed of before are now easily producible by perfected apparatus of this kind. Elsewhere Tesla wrote, There is practically no limit to the power of an oscillator. The conventional step-up transformer (short primary winding, long secondary on an iron core) boosts voltage at the expense of amperage. This is not true of Tesla's transformer. There is a real gain in power. Writing of the powerful coils he experimented with at his Colorado Springs lab, coils with outputs in excess of 12 million volts, Tesla wrote, It was a revelation to myself to find out that ... a single powerful streamer breaking out from a well insulated terminal may easily convey a current of several hundred amperes! The general impression is that the current in such a streamer is small. How it works A Tesla coil secondary has its own particular electrical character determined in part by the length of that slender coiled wire. Like a guitar string of a particular length, it wants to vibrate at a particular frequency. The secondary is inductively plucked by the primary coil. The primary circuit consists of a pulsating high-voltage source (a generator or conventional step-up transformer), a capacitor, a spark gap, and the primary coil itself. This circuit must be designed so that it vibrates at a frequency compatible with the frequency at which the secondary wants to vibrate. The primary circuit's frequency is determined by the frequency and voltage of the source, the capacity of the capacitor, the setting of the spark gap, and the character of the primary coil, determined in part by the length of its winding. Now when all these primary-circuit components are tuned to work in harmony with each other, and http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (5 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla the circuit's resulting frequency is right for plucking the secondary in a compatible rhythmic manner, the secondary becomes at its terminal end maximally excited and develops huge electrical potentials, which if not put to work, boil off as a corona of bluish light or as sparks and streamers that jump to nearby conductors with crackling reports. Unlike the conventional iron-core step-up transformer, whose core has the effect of damping vibrations, the secondary of the Tesla transformer is relatively free to swing unchecked. The pulsing from the primary coil has the effect of pushing a child in a swing. If it's done in a rhythmic manner at just the right moment at the end of a cycle, the swing will oscillate up to great heights. Similarly, with the right timing, the electrical vibration of the secondary can be made to swing up to tremendous amplitudes, voltages in the millions. This is the power of resonance. Manmade earthquake Tesla was fascinated with the power of resonance and experimented with it not only electrically but on the mechanical plane as well. In his Manhattan lab he built mechanical vibrators and tested their powers. One experiment got out of hand. Tesla attached a powerful little vibrator driven by compressed air to a steel pillar. Leaving it there, he went about his business. Meanwhile, down the street, a violent quaking built up, shaking down plaster, bursting plumbing, cracking widows, and breaking heavy machinery off its anchorage. Tesla's vibrator had found the resonant frequency of a deep sandy layer of subsoil beneath his building, setting up an earthquake. Soon Tesla's own building began to quake, and, just at the moment the police burst into the lab, Tesla was seen smashing the device with a sledgehammer, the only way he could promptly stop it. In a similar experiment, on an evening walk through the city, Tesla attached a battery-powered vibrator, described as being the size of an alarm clock, to the steel framework of a building under construction and, adjusting it to a suitable frequency, set the structure into resonant vibration. The structure shook, and so did the earth under his feet. Later Tesla boasted that he could shake down the Empire State Building with such a device, and, as if this claim were not extravagant enough, he went on to state that a large-scale resonant vibration was capable of splitting the Earth in half. No details of Tesla's vibrators are available, but they probably resembled one of Tesla's reciprocating engines (such as Patent No. 511,916). These exploited the elasticity of gases, just as his electrical vibrators, like the Tesla coil, exploit the elasticity of the electric medium. A new power system Tesla invented his resonant transformer, as the Tesla coil is sometimes called, to power a new type of high- frequency lighting system, as his 1891 patent drawing shows. This was the first Tesla coil patent. There followed a series of other patents developing the device. All of these are for bipolar coils: both ends of the secondary are connected to the working circuit (usually lamps), as opposed to the mono polar format favored by today's basement builders in which the top is connected to a ball or other terminal capacitor, the bottom to ground. The mono polar format emerges later in patents for radio and wireless power, including Tesla's magnifying transmitter. The 1896 patent drawing shows an evolved bipolar coil using tandem chokes to store energy for sudden release into the capacitor, enabling the device to be powered by relatively modest inputs. Chokes are coils wound on iron cores. They store energy as magnetism. When the charging current is interrupted, the magnetic field collapses inducing current in the coils, which rushes in to charge the capacitors.

This is why Tesla's early 60- cycle system triumphed over Edison's direct current. The high frequency, high-potential output of a Tesla coil can travel over relatively light conductors for vastly greater distances than conventional 60-cycle AC Losses occur to some degree from corona discharge but hardly at all from ohmic resistance. This type of current also renders conductive materials that are normally nonconductive, rarefied gases, for example. You might say these currents make a medium superconductive. Although super-magnetism is not in the picture because high-frequency vibrations would be severely damped by an electromagnet's iron core, it is revealing to reflect upon the unexploited superconductivity of Tesla energy these days when science is congratulating itself on new advances in the field. Prior to recent breakthroughs, superconductivity and super magnetism were low-temperature (cryogenic) phenomena, occurring when circuits were cooled down to near absolute zero. The new superconductivity at less drastically reduced temperatures developed out of the cryogenic work of the last twenty years, and this may be in debt to Tesla, who patented a similar idea way back in 1901. Tesla's patent shows that the deep cooling of conductors with agents like liquid air results in an extraordinary magnification of the oscillation in the resonating circuit. Imagine the performance of a super cooled Tesla coil. No electrocution. Since we tend to associate high voltage with possibly fatal electric shock it may be puzzling to learn that the output of a well-tuned Tesla coil, though in the millions of volts, is harmless. This is customarily thought to be because the amperage is low (it's not) or it's explained in terms of something called the skin effect, which means that the current travels over you instead of through. But the real reason is a matter of human frequency response. Just as your ears cannot respond to vibrations over about 30,000 cycles, or the eyes to light vibrations at or above ultra violet, your nervous system cannot be shocked by frequencies over about 2,000 cycles. Electrotherapy Now that you know it's harmless, would you believe these currents are even good for you? Fact is that a whole branch of medicine was founded on the healing effects of certain Tesla coil frequencies. Tesla understood the therapeutic value of high-frequency vibrations. He never patented in the area but did announce his findings to the medical community, and a number of devices were patented and marketed by others. Patients, by focusing certain frequencies on afflicted areas, or, in some cases, just sitting in the vicinity of vibrations from a device like the Lakhovsky Multi wave Oscillator, which produced a blend of specific frequencies, were said to have experienced relief from rheumatism and other painful conditions. It was even considered a cure for certain types of paralysis. Such radiation's increase the supply of blood to the area with a warming effect (diathermy). They enhance the oxygenation and nutritive value of the blood, increase various secretions, and accelerate the elimination of waste products in the blood. All this promotes healing. Electrotherapists even spoke of broadcasting vitamins to the body. Reversals of cancer tumor growths have been documented. Lakhovsky predicated science will discover, some day, not only the nature of microbes by the radiation they produce, but also a method of killing disease within the body by radiation. Electrotherapy devices were sold directly to the public via ads in popular magazines and in the Sears catalogs. Self-treatment was widespread. This easy access to treatment of all sorts of conditions led to the eventual suppression of the technology by the medical establishment. Electrotherapy, however, is making a big comeback. In chiropractic and sports medicine, low-frequency AC and DC pulses are being used to kill pain and exercise muscles. High-frequency electrotherapy is coming back in alternative healing practices. There is an increasing appreciation of the electrical nature of biological functioning and that some electric vibrations in the environment are harmful while others are healing. Reprints of Lakhovsky's works are widely read. There is a growing conviction that cancer can be effectively treated with high-frequency therapies. In his experimenting over an eight-year period, Tesla made no fewer than 50 types of oscillating coils.

He also experimented with novel shapes for the normally cylindrical coils, getting satisfying results from cone shapes and flat spirals. At Colorado Springs Tesla achieved phenomenally increased outputs by using a third coil resonantly tuned to the secondary. Observing the tremendous magnification this achieved, he gave much of his attention to integrating this extra coil, as he called it, into an evolved outsize tesla coil called the magnifying transmitter. 4. Magnifying Transmitters; Wireless Power In 1893 Tesla told a meeting of the National Electric Light Association that he believed it practical to disturb, by means of powerful machines, the electrostatic conditions of the earth, and thus transmit intelligible signals, and, perhaps, power. He said, It could not require a great amount of energy to produce a disturbance perceptible at a great distance, or even all over the surface of the earth. The ultimate powerful machine for these tasks is Tesla's magnifying transmitter. How it works An extra coil gives the resonant boost of a Tesla coil secondary but has the advantage of being more independent in its movement. A secondary, being closely slaved to the primary, is inhibited somewhat by it, its oscillations slightly damped. The extra coil is able to swing more freely. Extra coils, writes Tesla, enable the obtainment of practically any EMF, the limits being so far remote that I would not hesitate to produce sparks of thousands of feet in this manner. The engineering challenge of the magnifying transmitter, then, becomes one of containing and properly radiating its immense electrical activities, measured in the tens and even hundreds of thousands of horsepower, as Tesla put it. Containment and effective radiation of this power is the whole point of the design shown, for which Tesla applied for patent in 1902. The heavy primary is wound on top of the secondary at the base of the tower. The extra coil extends upward through a hooded connection to a conductive cylinder. The antenna is a toroid, a donut-shaped geometry that allows for a maximum of surface area with a comparative minimum of electrical capacity. Since this is a high-frequency device, a relatively low capacity is desirable. To increase the area of the radiating surface, the outside of the toroid is covered with half-spherical metal plates. A subtlety of the design is that the conductive cylinder is of larger radius than the radius of curvature of these plates, since a tighter curve would allow escape of energy. The cylinder is polished to minimize losses through irregularities in the surface. At the center of the top surface sits a pointy plate that serves as a safety valve for overloads so the powerful discharge may dart out there and lose itself harmlessly in the air. Tesla advises bringing the power up slowly and carefully so pressure does not build at some point below the antenna, in which case a ball of fire might break out and destroy the support or anything else in the way, an event that may take place with inconceivable violence. Current in the antenna could build to an incredible 4000 amperes. A.C. / D.C. Wireless power transmission via the magnifying transmitter was the ultimate development of the inventor who had earlier brought alternating-current power to the world with his poly phase system. The predecessor of A.C. was a direct-current system developed, manufactured, and marketed chiefly by Thomas Edison. Direct current was adequate for serving small areas but was unworkable for long distance transmission. By contrast, A.C. could be transmitted for long distances over lighter wires and its voltage could be stepped up for transmission and down for consumption by means of transformers. Tesla invented from scratch a new kind of motor (poly phase) that could utilize A.C., and he greatly evolved earlier concepts of dynamos to generate A.C. as well as transformers to step voltage up and down. Whereas Edison's D.C. would have been suitable for a society of http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (8 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla small, autonomous communities, the evolving system of industrial rule wanted centralized power and needed A.C.'s long distance capability to serve huge sprawling populations. George Westinghouse, an inventor (the air brake) who, like Edison, turned industrialist (having found that to profit from an invention one must undertake manufacturing and marketing as well) saw the promise in Tesla's poly phase inventions and formed an alliance with the young prodigy. Westinghouse paid Tesla one million dollars and contracted to pay a royalty of one dollar per horsepower for the poly phase inventions. Later Westinghouse was forced to renege on the royalty. Together, Westinghouse and Tesla triumphed over Edison's D.C. system and installed the first A.C. power facilities, the most notable being the hydra plant at Niagara Falls. Tesla believed in hydropower. His ultimate energy-magnifying, wireless power system would have been hydro-based. The centralized A.C. electric power system we have today was forced into existence on a colossal scale by utility magnates of that era, the most prominent being Samuel Insull, who became infamous in some circles for his massive bilking of the investing public and famous in others for hammering together the electric power complex now in place. This complex has developed into a federally protected monopoly with greater capital wealth than any other industry in the U. S. In the order of energy sources used, Tesla's hydropower has been left well behind the burning of fossil fuels, a process that dumps 24 million tons of pollutants into the nation's air supply each year. Hydropower even runs way behind the nukes in kilowatt-hours produced. So went another Tesla dream. Tesla was a celebrity in his poly phase heyday, but today his celebrity is as an underground cult figure known for his radically progressive energy-magnifying, free-energy, and wireless power inventions, which, of course, have no place in the established system. Power by wire Prior to his wireless power inventions, Tesla patented in 1897 a high frequency system that transmitted power by wire. The system used previously unheard of levels of electric potential. He notes that at these voltages, conventional power would destroy the equipment, but that his system not only contains this energy but is harmless to handle while in use. This system is not a circuit in the usual sense but a single wire without return. It employs the familiar Tesla coil configurations at both sending and receiving ends. The primary circuit (power source, capacitor, spark gap) is represented in the drawing by the generator symbol. The secondary coil is a flat spiral. An advantage in this coil design is that the voltage adjacent to the primary, where arcing across could occur, is at zero and soars to high values as the coil spirals inward. The same patent also shows a cone- shaped secondary in which the primary is at the base of the cone, which is at zero potential. Wireless power The drawing for Tesla's wireless power patent looks like the earlier power-by-wire patent except now spherical antennas replace the transmission lines, which are dropped out of the picture almost as if they were redundant. The ball antenna is peculiarly Tesla, as is the toroid, and you wonder why nothing like them have appeared since. In this 1900 patent, wireless power is not represented as an earth-resonant system. Here Tesla talks about transmission through elevated strata. The patent contains much discussion of how rarefied gases in the upper atmosphere became quite conductive when there is applied many hundred thousand or millions of volts. Balloons are suggested to send the antennas aloft. Appreciate that Tesla in this patent has invented nothing less than the principles of radio. Tesla recognizes only a quantitative difference between sending radio signals and broadcasting electric power. Both involve sending and receiving stations tuned to one another by means of tesla coil circuits. Tesla's wireless power would be the ultimate centralized electric system, a capitalist dream, but for the fact that the technology is too simple. Just raising an antenna, planting a ground, and connecting simple Tesla coil circuitry in between could achieve reception of power. http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (9 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla Although Tesla himself patented a couple of electric meters for high frequencies, it would be all too easy for consumers to tune in for free, just as many today bootleg pay TV signals using illicit equipment far more sophisticated. It is no wonder, then, that the electric power establishment didn't welcome this invention. This was one problem. Another was that the established electric power system would have to be relegated to another great pile of scrap, and maybe the established system of political power as well. Tesla's announced dream was to use hydra sources where available and through wireless power broadcast that energy around the planet, thus liberating the world from poverty. Such a scheme would not be readily embraced by powers that sustain their rule by keeping populations poor and weak. Centralized control of energy, as well as other resources, is, of course, believed to be essential to civilized rule, at least as far as thinking on that subject has progressed in this era. Moreover, no multinational political system was in existence, or is now for that matter, that could implement a technology of such global implications. Tesla was blind to such considerations. His commitment, his overriding priority as a technological purist, was to take machine possibilities to their logical conclusions. Today, if wireless power were seriously proposed, there would no doubt be at least one political problem that would not have arisen in Tesla's time: resistance from environmentalists. What would an environmental impact report have to say about biologic hazards? A Navy submarine communication system that uses extremely low frequency (ELF) waves, down to below 10 cycles, has been challenged by environmentalists, as have microwave and 60 cycle high-voltage transmission lines. Engineering details Patents normally don't give many quantitative specifics, but Tesla's wireless power patent does give some about the big prototype power-transmission Tesla coil (which was, incidentally, used to conduct a demonstration before skeptical patent examiners). A 50,000-volt transformer charged a capacitor of .004 mfd., which discharged through a rotary gap that gave 5,000 breaks per second. The eight-foot diameter primary had just one turn of stout stranded cable. The secondary was 50 turns of heavily insulated No. 8 wire wound as a flat spiral. It vibrated at 230-250,000 cycles and produced 2 to 4 million volts. This coil evolved into the huge experimental magnifying transmitter Tesla describes in his Colorado Springs notes. Housed in a specially built lab 110 feet square, the device used a 50,000 volt Westinghouse transformer to charge a capacitor that consisted of a galvanized tub full of salt water as an electrolyte, into which he placed large glass bottles, themselves containing salt water. The salt water in the tub was one plate of this capacitor, the salt water inside the bottles the other plate, and the bottle glass the dielectric. Various capacities were tried, incremental changes being made by connecting more or fewer bottles. A variable tuning coil of 20 turns was connected to the primary, which consisted of two turns of heavy insulated cable that ran around the base of the huge fence like wooden secondary framework. The secondary had 24 turns of No. 8 wire on a diameter of 51 feet Various extra coils were tried, the final version being 12 feet high, 8 feet in diameter, and having 100 turns of No. 8 wire. The antenna was a 30-inch conductive ball adjustable for height on a 142-foot mast. The huge transmitter could vibrate from 45 to 150 kilocycles. Even with the big transformer, this bill of materials does not seem inaccessible to enterprising people, and the technology does not seem so abstruse, so it is no wonder that people have gotten together to build magnifying transmitters and experiment with wireless power without support from corporations or government. One such group was the People's Power Project in central Minnesota in the late 70's. This group, largely farmers, objected to high voltage power lines trespassing on their land and set out to build an alternative. Limited by the sketchy information then available, the project was not successful. Another attempt, called Project Tesla, is being set up in Colorado. Endowed with more precise calculations and more experienced personnel, Project Tesla will try to repeat Tesla's wireless-power experiment and verify his theory by taking measurements at various remote locations. http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (10 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla Earth resonance Among the appealing features of Colorado Springs for Tesla was the region's frequent and sensational electrical storms. For Tesla, lightning was a joyous phenomenon. Biographers report that, during storms back East, Tesla would throw open the windows of his New York lab and recline on a couch for the duration, muttering to himself ecstatically. In Colorado Springs he tuned in and tracked lightning storms using rudimentary radio receiving equipment. He thereby determined that lightning was a vibratory phenomenon, which set up standing waves bouncing within the earth at a frequency resonantly compatible with the earth's electrical capacity. This earth-resonant frequency, he reasoned, was the ideal frequency for wireless power transmission, and he tuned his ultimate magnifying transmitter accordingly. The literature contains various reports on exactly what this frequency is. Some say 150 kilocycles, which would be at the upper range of the Colorado Springs transmitter. Others give frequencies considerably lower, 11.78 cycles, 6.8 cycles, frequencies Tesla's transmitter may have achieved harmonically. With reinforcement from the earth resonance, the power would actually increase in the process of transmission. In one memorable experiment with the Colorado Springs transmitter, Tesla shot from the antenna ball veritable lightning bolts of 135 feet, producing thunder heard 15 miles distant, and, in the process, pulled so many amperes that he burned out the municipal generator. In another experiment he lit up wirelessly, at a distance of 26 miles from the lab, a bank of 10,000 watts worth of incandescent bulbs. Two years after Colorado Springs, Tesla applied for patent for the far more refined magnifying transmitter shown at the opening of this chapter, a patent that was not granted until a dozen years later. In this patent he no longer speaks of energy broadcast through the upper strata of the atmosphere but of a grounded resonant circuit. Tesla predicted that his magnifying transmitter would prove most important and valuable to future generations, that it would bring about an industrial revolution and make possible great humanitarian achievements. Instead, as we shall see, the magnifying transmitter became Tesla's Waterloo. 5. Magnifying Transmitter II ; Grounded Radio: With the backing of J. P. Morgan, Tesla began, soon after returning from Colorado Springs, the construction of a magnifying transmitter tower at Wardenclyffe, near Shoreham, Long Island. Though closely related to a wireless power propagator and intended for further experimentation in that area, the tower was built specifically as the first station in Tesla's proposed World System of broadcasting. The system was to carry programming for the general public as well as private communications. Tesla was the first to suggest the broadcasting of news and entertainment to the public; only point-to-point signaling had been experimented with up to then. The fully realized World System was to serve as a multi- frequency wireless interconnects for all existing telephone, telegraph, and stock ticker services around the planet. Exclusivity and noninterference of priority private communications was to be assured by multiplex techniques. The giant transmitter was also to carry a universal time register, navigation beacons, and facsimile transmissions. This was in 1902. As we shall see, Tesla's massive contribution to radio is still largely unrecognized. The Wardenclyffe tower's rugged wooden structure, designed by Stanford White, stood at 187 feet. It was topped by a mushroom-like terminal 68 feet in diameter. A separate brick building at the foot housed generating and other equipment. The entire project was to cover 200 acres and include housing for 2,000 employees of the facility. Tesla estimated that the tower would emit a wave complex of a total maximum activity of 10 million horsepower. The top of the tower was outfitted with a platform that may have been intended to accommodate powerful ultraviolet lamps, which Tesla could have used for an experimental beam system of electric power transmission that was on his mind.

From: A MUSEUM AT WARDENCLYFFE - THE CREATION OF A MONUMENT TO NIKOLA TESLA The year was 1900 and following 9 productive months of wireless propagation research in Colorado, Nikola Tesla was anxious to put a mass of new found knowledge to work. His vision focused on the development of a prototype wireless communications station and research facility and he needed a site on which to build. In 1901 he cast his eyes some 60 miles eastward to the north shore village of Woodville Landing. Only six years before the north branch of the Long Island Railroad had opened, reducing travel time to the locality from a horse drawn five hours to less than two. Seeing an opportunity in land development a western lawyer and banker by the name of James S. Warden had purchased 1400 acres in the area and started building an exclusive summer resort community known as Wardenclyffe-On-Sound. With an opportunity for further development in mind, Warden offered Tesla a 200 acre section of this parcel lying directly to the south of the newly laid track. It was anticipated that implementation of Tesla's system would eventually lead to the establishment of a \"Radio City\" to house the thousands of employees needed for operation of the facility. The proximity to Manhattan and the fairly short travel time between the two, along with the site's closeness to a railway line must surely have been attractive features and Tesla accepted the offer. The Wardenclyffe World Wireless facility as envisioned by Tesla was to have been quite different from present day radio broadcasting stations. While there was to be a great similarity in the apparatus employed, the method in which it was to be utilized would have been radically different. Conventional transmitters are designed so as to maximize the amount of power radiated from the antenna structure. Such equipment must process tremendous amounts of power in order to counteract the loss in field strength encountered as the signal radiates out from its point of origin. The transmitter at Wardenclyffe was being configured so as to minimize the radiated power. The energy of Tesla's steam driven Westinghouse 200 kW alternator was to be channeled instead into an extensive underground radial structure of iron pipe installed 120 feet beneath the tower's base. This was to be accomplished by superposing a low frequency baseband signal on the higher frequency signal coursing through the transmitter's helical resonator. The low frequency current in the presence of an enveloping corona-induced plasma of free charge carriers would have pumped the earth's charge. It is believed the resulting ground current and its associated wave complex would have allowed the propagation of wireless transmissions to any distance on the earth's surface with as little as 5% loss due to radiation. The terrestrial transmission line modes so excited would have supported a system with the following technical capabilities: 1. Establishment of a multi-channel global broadcasting system with programming including news, music, etc; 2. Interconnection of the world's telephone and telegraph exchanges, and stock tickers; 3. Transmission of written and printed matter, and data; 4. World wide reproduction of photographic images; 5. Establishment of a universal marine navigation and location system, including a means for the synchronization of precision timepieces; 6. Establishment of secure wireless communications services. The plan was to build the first of many installations to be located near major population centers around the world. If the program had moved forward without interruption, the Long Island prototype would have been followed by additional units the first of which being built somewhere along the coast of England. By the Summer of 1902 Tesla had shifted his laboratory operations from the Houston Street Laboratory to the rural Long Island setting and work began in earnest on development of the station and furthering of the propagation research. Construction had been made possible largely through the backing of financier J. Pierpont Morgan who had offered Tesla $150,000 towards the end of 1900. By July 1904, however, this support had run out and with a subsequent major down turn in the financial markets Tesla was compelled to pursue alternative methods of financing. With funds raised through an unrecorded mortgage against the property, additional http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (12 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla venture capital, and the sale of X-ray tube power supplies to the medical profession he was able to make ends meet for another couple of years. In spite of valiant efforts to maintain the operation, income dwindled and his employees were eventually dropped from the payroll. Still, Tesla was certain that his wireless system would yield handsome rewards if it could only be set into operation and so the work continued as he was able. A second mortgage in 1908 acquired again from the Waldorf-Astoria proprietor George C. Boldt allowed some additional bills to be paid, but debt continued to mount and between 1912 and 1915 Tesla's financial condition disintegrated. The loss of ability to make additional payments was accompanied by the collapse of his plan for high capacity trans-Atlantic wireless communications. The property was foreclosed, Nikola Tesla honored the agreement with his debtor and title on the property was signed over to Mr. Boldt. The plant's abandonment sometime around 1911-1912 followed by demolition and salvaging of the tower in 1917 essentially brought an end to this era. Tesla's April 20, 1922 loss on appeal of the judgment completely closed the door to any further chance of his developing the site. Tesla; the Father of Radio? As we have seen, Tesla's earliest oscillators were dynamos, but, having determined that he could not reach the higher frequencies by this means, he went on to develop the spark gap oscillator, the Tesla coil, and the magnifying transmitter. But did any of these devices become the first to be used for overseas radio transmission? No, ironically, the first commercial overseas transmitter was a 21.8 kilocycle GE Alexanderson alternator operated by RCA, a design evolved straight out of Tesla's early dynamos. Such was Tesla's luck in radio. Official histories often credit Tesla with the poly phase system and either ignore his later inventions altogether or dismiss them as the work of. a crackpot. But among those who have published honest research on the subject, there is one hundred percent consensus that Tesla was cheated out of his rightful place in history, particularly his status as the leading inventor of radio technology. Radio simplified Early radio devices are fascinating and worthy of study if only because they remind us that powerful radio technologies can be so simple and accessible to anyone, the present-day micro complexity notwithstanding. As we have seen, the earliest transmitters in wide use by amateurs were not alternators but spark-gap oscillators. To get on the air all you needed was a battery, a telegraph key, an induction coil, a spark gap, a length of wire as an antenna, and a ground. Of course, the addition of a capacitor juiced it up considerably. The very earliest experiments in radio receiving used spark gaps as receivers. When you saw an arc across the gap, this was the detection of a disturbance in the medium. This evolved into a detector called a coherer. This is just a horizontal glass tube loosely filled with metal chips (iron, nickel). It is placed in series with a battery and a telegraph sounder, and one side of the coherer goes to the antenna, the other to ground. The coherer is a switch (a semiconductor, really) that conducts when there is a disturbance of the medium. The more easily conducted radio-frequency energy triggers conduction of this almost conductive material. To get the coherer back to a non conducting state requires a tap that can be accomplished manually or by mechanical linkage to the telegraph sounder. Tesla comes into the technology about here. He improves the coherer by putting it into continual rotation (rotating coherer) so it didn't need a tap to reset. Tuned radio The spark gap transmitter was indiscriminate as to the frequency of the disturbance. It put out a dirty complex of frequencies consisting of a rough fundamental determined by width of gap, together with parasitic http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (13 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla oscillations, harmonics splatter what-have-you. The coherer was set off by any disturbance. In Colorado Springs, Tesla used a rotating coherer to track electrical storms. The celebrated Marconi units employed nothing more evolved than this crash method of signaling. So why is Marconi so famous? It is because, like Edison and Westinghouse, he built up an industry around the invention and made himself famous in the course of promoting his enterprise. Marconi's company was ultimately incorporated into RCA (now incorporated into General Electric). It owed much of its technological development to ideas lifted from the likes of Tesla. Tesla's contribution was nothing less than selective tuning. He set forth the principle of resonantly tuned circuits in his Tesla coil patent of 1896, and the principles of transmitter-receiver tuned circuits a year later in his wireless power patent. The Tesla coil is a powerful and simple radio transmitter. If the primary circuit is smoothly vibrating well above the audio range, its signal can even be modulated for voice transmission by varying some circuit element. Tesla's few published notes on modulation describe crude ways of varying spark gaps, but, conceivably, an inductance core mechanically linked to a loudspeaker transducer might modulate the signal with some fidelity. Tesla and his supporters waged a fight for recognition of Tesla as the founder of radio. The struggle was finally won in the Supreme Court, but this did not happen until shortly after Tesla's death. Tesla vs. Hertz Tesla was not a theoretician by calling, but he made plenty of observations on the electrical nature of the universe that put him at odds with of official theory. In fashion then (and even now) was the theory of Heinrich Hertz, an interpreter of the physics of James Maxwell. Hertz explained radio propagation as transverse waves akin to light. Tesla was convinced that radio disturbances were standing waves in the ether akin to sound. When you drop a pebble into water, the disturbances you see in the form of concentric circles are standing waves. Both Tesla and Hertz assumed the existence of an aetheric medium, but differed as to its energy transmitting properties. Tesla believed that the ether was a gas like medium, that electric propagation was very much like that of sounds in air, alternate compression's and rarefaction's of the medium, and that Hertzian waves could only take place in a solid medium. Tesla once said that Hertz waves are radiation and that no energy could be economically transmitted to a distance by any such agency. He said, In my system, the process is one of true conduction which can be effected at the greatest distance without appreciable loss. When quantum physics and particle theory came into vogue, the aetheric medium was dropped out of electric theory altogether, but Hertz's theory was more compatible with the new concepts of propagation and therefore survived. By way of rubbing this in, the unit of frequency, formerly cycles per second (cps), was renamed in honor of Hertz (Hz), while only an obscure unit of magnetic flux density remembers Tesla. It is in respect to Tesla that I have reverted to the old unit in this book. Hertzian radio is straight-line, light-like radiation's that bounce off hills and mountains. Long distance Hertzian transmissions are explained in terms of radiation's bouncing off a radio reflective upper layer called the ionosphere. Tesla thought this was all nonsense and declared in 1919 that Hertzian thinking has stifled creative effort in the wireless art and retarded it for 25 years. Hertzian radio is aerial. Most of us are conditioned to thinking in terms of aerial radio; the air waves, on the air. Tesla's radio is grounded; the lower end of the energized coil is rooted in the earth. Pure Hertzian radio has no such natural load. Tesla doesn't speak of antennas as such; the element he places aloft is an elevated capacity. Tesla said radio devices should be designed with due regard to the physical properties of this planet and the electrical conditions obtaining in same. Grounded radio is indeed more powerful than the Hertzian aerial. But this is true particularly for the frequencies Tesla was using. The higher frequencies do behave in a Hertzian manner. Yet grounding is all but a lost concept in consumer electronics. Up through the 1940's, AM radio receivers customarily had a terminal one was encouraged to connect to a cold water pipe or other deep earth http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (14 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla connection. Ground the chassis of any of today's receivers, and, unless there is some kind of interference coming up through the ground (from fluorescent circuits, light dimmers, which are oscillators, or from the local Tesla coil), you will usually improve signal strength and range. Among Tesla's contributions to radio was remote control. Tesla demonstrated a radio-controlled boat before crowds at Madison Square Gardens and sent another robot craft 25 miles up the Hudson River. Grounded radio works particularly well through water. Tesla's basic radio tuning tank circuit for receiving (coil plus capacitor between antenna and ground) was, and is, all by itself, a powerful signal amplifier, and a beautifully simple one, at that. But as radio developed over the years, the tank circuit shrank in size and the result was a loss in gain. This was compensated for by the addition of stage upon stage of complex amplification circuitry. Tesla watched this development with bewilderment. Tesla knew that the most efficient long-distance radio took place in the lower frequencies, especially those close to the earth-resonant frequency. Frequencies well below the AM broadcast band were the favored ham frequencies in the early days prior to World War I. In fact, waves of 600 meters (500 kc) were considered short while considered fairly long were the waves of 1200 meters (25 kc). Like a lot of good real estate, many of these more radio-effective frequencies below the AM broadcast band have been appropriated for military use, but also for navigation beacons, weather stations, and time registers. Underground radio The mind conditioned by Hertzian aerial radio concepts has trouble grasping the idea that signaling can take place without any above-surface antenna, totally through the ground. James Harris Rogers, taking a cue from Tesla, circa World War I, built a radio system in which both sending and receiving antennas were sunk completely into the ground or submerged in bodies of water. He found this system far more effective and far less vulnerable to interference than any aerial radio Signal strength has been said to be 5,000 times stronger The military is on to this, as evidenced in the Navy's ELF and by a U. S. Air Force project underway called Ground Wave Emergency Network. GWEN is a low-frequency communications system designed for used during a nuclear war. The network will have a cross-continent series of 600-foot diameter underground copper screens connected to 300-foot towers reminiscent of Tesla's Wardenclyffe. Among the advantages of the system is its invulnerability to the effects of the electric pulse sent out by nuclear blasts. Such a pulse fries at one stroke any and all solid-state electronics within its extensive range. (Strong electric vibrations from a Tesla coil or magnifying transmitter have a similar effect on solid state and will scramble or disable such circuitry temporarily or even dud it permanently.) It's revealing that for last-ditch doomsday communications, the government reverts to Tesla's grounded radio. J. P. Morgan sinks Tesla Tesla's ambitious World System came to an end when its principal financier, J. P. Morgan pulled the plug on funding. Morgan, the financial giant behind the formation of many monopolies in railroads, shipping, steel, banking, etc., was a major conduit of European capital into U. S. industrial development in the Robber Baron era. He looms large in Tesla's life. Morgan money was in the Niagara Falls project. He backed Edison, too. It was Morgan's pressure on Westinghouse, whom he also financed, that caused the cancellation of Tesla's dollar-a-horsepower contract and the loss of millions in royalties to Tesla for his poly phase. When Tesla's lab burned down (arson was suspected), one of Morgan's men promptly arrived with aid, as well as with the offer of a partnership with Morgan interests. Acceptance would have put Tesla firmly under Morgan's control. Tesla refused. And Tesla succeeded in preserving his autonomy until he became possessed with overwhelming ardor to fulfill the dream of his World system. Tesla was ready to sell his soul to finance Wardenclyffe, and J. P. Morgan was right there to buy it. http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (15 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla In 1901, Tesla signed over to Morgan controlling interest in the patents he still owned, as well as all future ones, in lighting and radio. Morgan then put about $150,000 startup funding into Wardenclyffe. Later he invested more, just enough to bring the project within sight of completion. Morgan then became elusive. Tesla tried desperately to communicate with the investor, but to no avail. When word was out on Wall Street that Morgan had withdrawn support, no one would touch the project. This finished Tesla as a functioning inventor. Work on the Wardenclyffe tower came to a halt. Left to dereliction, the tower remained only as a curiosity to passersby. During World War I, the tower was unceremoniously dynamited to the ground. 6. Lighting In 1891 Tesla said that existing methods of lighting were very wasteful, that some better methods must be invented, some more perfect apparatus devised. Tesla went and did just that. Yet, here we are today, in a world lit predominantly by the same Edison bulb! Edison's bulb burns with six percent efficiency, the rest going off as heat, while the high resistance filament cooks at 4,000 degrees and eventually breaks without warning. Today's fluorescent tube, though inspired by Tesla, is no model of efficiency either. Its inner surfaces are stimulated to phosphorescence by energy-consuming filament-like cathodes that also burn out, and the lit-up tube would present a dead short to the current if it were not for the so-called ballast transformer, an inductance placed in the circuit to oppose and thus eat up yet more current. What sent Tesla into an exploration of high frequency phenomena was his conviction that these rapid vibrations held the key to a superior mode of lighting. The explorations were not Tesla's first venture into lighting. His very first U. S. patent (1885) is for an improvement in the arc lamp. He used an electromagnet to feed carbons to the arc at a uniform rate to produce a steadier light (No. 335,785). Early arc lamps produced a brilliant blue-white light, good for street lighting but not for the home, and they emitted noxious fumes. Home lighting was by gas. Street arc lighting used series circuits. Edison introduced the parallel circuit, and designed his lamp for such a circuit. Edison introduced the big scale production and sale of electric power itself on the model of gas lighting, a major industry at the time. He wanted to be first in the business and announced to the press that he had an operable bulb before he actually had a bulb that worked. When Tesla's a.c. system was established, it was grafted on to Edison's, greatly extending its range and efficiency. But, essentially, it was still Edison's parallel circuit, high consumption, incandescent lighting system, and this is what we have to live with today. A better way Tesla patented both his spark-gap oscillator and his Tesla coil specifically as power sources for a new lighting system that used currents of high frequency and high potential. Lest you get the impression that a lone genius named Tesla invented this new form of lighting out of the blue, you should know that others before him had used high frequencies to stimulate light, and others, like Sir William Crookes, had done the same with high potentials, but Tesla was the first on record to put the two together. In Jules Verne's 1872 novel A Journey to the Center of the Earth, the narrator tells of a brilliant portable battery lamp used by the underground explorers. The device was powered by a Ruhmkorf coil; a high voltage buzzer- type induction coil (step-up transformer) popular among early electrical experimenters. The Ruhmkorf coil stimulated a lamp (type unspecified but probably a gas tube), which produced the light of an artificial day. The lamp had such a low current draw that the battery lasted throughout the subterranean adventure. Verne evidently was drawing, at least in part, on experimental knowledge of his day for what he calls this ingenious application of electricity to practical purposes. Perhaps somebody should reinvent such a high potential lamp to replace today's flashlight, which seems to exist for the purpose of enriching the Eveready division of Union Carbide. Modern neon lighting is high potential at 2,000 to 15,000 volts. (Neon sign transformers are good for powering tesla coils, but a low- http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (16 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla frequency, high voltage device: caution.) Neon, as well as its cousin, 7,500-volt cold cathode (filament's) fluorescent, which is used in some industrial lighting, is as close as we get to Tesla lighting today. Circa 1900, Tesla experimented with luminous tubes bent into alphabetic characters and other shapes. Although today's neon is simplistic Tesla, being driven by 60-cycle high-voltage transformer power alone without the benefits of high-frequency excitation, it should suggest to us the amazing efficiency of high- potential lighting, since a single 15,000-volt neon transformer drawing only 230 watts can light up a tube extending up to 120 feet. How superior is the economy of Tesla high potential, high frequency lighting over Edison incandescent? Tesla says certainly 20 times, if not more light is obtained for the same expenditure of energy. \"Pure\" light Tesla invented a variety of lamps, not all of which show up in his patents. He lit up solid bodies like carbon rods in vacuum bulbs, or in bulbs containing various inert gases at low pressure (rarefied). He noted that tubes devoid of any electrodes may be used, and there is no difficulty in producing by their means light to read by. But he noted that the effect is considerably increased by the use of phosphorescent bodies, such as yttrium, uranium glass, etc. Here Tesla lays the foundation for fluorescent lighting. Applied to such lamps were currents at potentials ranging from a lower limit of 20,000 volts up to voltages in the millions and vibrations of 15,000 cycles per second and up. Tesla dreamed of creating what he called pure light or cold light by generating electric vibrations at frequencies that equaled those of visible light itself. Light produced by this direct and efficient means would require vibrations of 350 to 750 billion cycles, but Tesla believed such oscillations, far above those attainable by his coils, would someday be achieved. Even so, his rarefied gas-tube lamps produced a light that more closely approximated natural daylight than any other artificial source Tesla's light is like the full-spectrum light that is coming to be recognized as far more healthful than Edison incandescent and particularly more healthful than conventional fluorescent. Full-spectrum lighting is believed by some health practitioners actually to have healing properties. No sudden burnout Tesla's gas tube lamps burn indefinitely, as do today's neon tubes, for there is nothing within to be consumed. Tesla's lamps that contain electrodes like carbon rods, however, do undergo some deterioration. In Tesla's words, a very slow destruction and gradual diminution in size always occurs, as in incandescent filaments; but there is no possibility of sudden and premature disabling which occurs in the latter by the breaking of the filament, especially when incandescent bodies are in the shape of blocks. In vacuum lamps, the life of the bulb depends upon the degree of exhaustion, which can never be made perfect. Also, the higher the frequency applied to such a lamp the slower the deterioration. Electrodes glow at high temperatures, and this raises the problem of how to conduct energy to them since wires or other metallic elements will melt. The problem must be addressed in lamp design. For example, in the incandescent lamp shown at the opening of this chapter, the lead-in wires connect to the hot electrodes via bronze powder contained in a refractory cup. Tesla may have designed his capacitor-base bulbs to help address this same problem. High heat Tesla's search for the ideal electrode is reminiscent of Edison's search for the long lasting filament: The production of a small electrode capable of withstanding enormous temperatures, said Tesla, ìI regard as the greatest importance in the manufacture of light. One of the electrodes he tried was a small button of carbon, which he placed in a near vacuum. Tesla regarded the high incandescence of the button to be a necessary evil. For lighting purposes, it was the incandescence of the gas remaining in the mostly evacuated chamber that was important. But the carbon-button lamp proved to have some remarkable properties beyond its use for illumination. When the voltage was turned up, the lamp produced such tremendous heat that the carbon button http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (17 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla rapidly vaporized. Tesla experimented extensively with this fascinating phenomenon. For the button of carbon he substituted zirconium, the most refractory substance available at the time. It fused instantly. Even rubies vaporized. Diamonds, and, to a greater degree, carborundum, endured the best, but these could also be vaporized at high potentials. Tesla worked on the problem of heating. I have read that he contributed to the development of a high- frequency induction heating. Did Tesla work on the problem of space heating? Certainly the huge current draw of conventional electric heaters, which use resistive elements, argues for some inventiveness in this area. Tesla did observe that the discharges from a tesla coil resembled flames escaping under pressure and were indeed hot. He reflected that a similar process must take place in the ordinary flame, that this might be an electric phenomenon. He said that electric discharges might be a possible way of producing by other than chemical means a veritable flame which would give light and heat without material consumed. The behavior of the carbon-button lamp suggests that a new heating mode might be found in the effects of high-frequency currents in a vacuum. Lighting up the sky Hold a fluorescent tube near a Tesla coil and it will light up in your hand. This is true of any tube or bulb with vacuum or rarefied gas. A more efficient way is to ground one end of the tube and put a length of wire as a sort of antenna on the other. Better yet, put a coil of wire that resonates with the secondary in series with the tube and ground and you have the optimal wireless power arrangement. Tesla conducted many experiments with different arrangements like this, using on some occasions the widely available Edison filament incandescent, which lighted up more brilliantly than usual because of the effects of high frequencies on the bulbs rarefied interior. Inside his New York lab Tesla strung a wire connected to a tesla coil around the perimeter of the room. Wherever he needed light he hung a gas tube in the vicinity of this high frequency conductor. Tesla had a bold fantasy whereby he would use the principle of rarefied gas luminescence to light up the sky at night. High frequency electric energy would be transmitted, perhaps by an ionizing beam of ultraviolet radiation, into the upper atmosphere, where gases are at relatively low pressure, so that this layer would behave like a luminous tube. Sky lighting, he said, would reduce the need for street lighting, and facilitate the movement of ocean going vessels. The aurora borealis is an electrical phenomenon that works on this principle, the effects of cosmic eruptions such as those from the sun being the source of electric stimulation. I, for one, am grateful that this particular Tesla fantasy never materialized since it is difficult enough to see the stars with existing light pollution, and there might be undesirable biological impacts as well. Rotating brush Tesla took an evacuated incandescent type lamp globe, suspended within it at dead center a conductive element, stimulated that element with high voltage currents from an induction coil, and thus created a beam- like emanation, a brush discharge that was so eerily sensitive to disturbances in its environs that it seemed to be endowed with an intelligent life of its own. The device works best if there is no lead-in wire. In the bulb shown, every measure has been taken to construct it so it is free from its own electrical influence. The bulb could be stimulated inductively by applying energy to metal foil wrapped around its neck. Thus excited, an intense phosphorescence then spreads at first over the globe, but soon gives place to a white misty light, observes Tesla. The glow then resolves into a directional brush or beam that will spin around the central element. So responsive is it to any electrostatic or magnetic changes in its vicinity that the approach of an observer at a few paces from the bulb will cause the brush to fly to the opposite side. A small, inch-wide permanent magnet will affect it visibly at a distance of two meters, slowing down or accelerating the rotation according to how it is held relatively to the brush. Tesla never patented the rotating brush or used it in any practical application, but he believed it could have http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (18 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla practical applications. He saw one use in radio where the device could conceivably be adapted to being a most sensitive detector of disturbances in the medium. The rotating brush appears to be a precursor of the plasma globe toys now in fashion; these are sometimes called Tesla globes. Tesla's new lighting was famous in its time. Tesla, the promoter, saw to it. He conducted demonstrations at lectures before the electric industry associations, before large audiences in rented halls, and before select groups of influential New Yorkers in his Manhattan lab. His articles about the new lighting were published in the popular scientific press and it was reported in the newspapers. Still, it did not catch on with the powers-that-be who no doubt saw in it Tesla's perennial pile-of scrap problem. But, I wonder, would the whole electric distribution system have to be scrapped to implement the efficiencies of Tesla lighting? Conceivably, the new lighting could be run off of local oscillators at the consumer end, the old power distribution system remaining intact. This is still a possibility, as it has been for about one hundred years. 7. Transportation Tesla speculated, that, perhaps the most valuable application of wireless energy, will be the propulsion of the flying machine, which will carry no fuel and be free from any limitations of the present airplanes and dirigibles. The possibility of electric flight intrigued Tesla, though he never did patent an electric aircraft. But he did patent an electric railway using his high frequency, high-potential electricity in a by-wire mode, and also patented a radical aircraft that, while not electric, did have an advanced power plant: his disk turbine. Tesla's railway and aircraft can be numbered among the lost inventions. The closest transport technology has come to putting any of Tesla into actual practice is with diesel-electric power using Tesla poly phase motors, an early and notable example of which was the ocean liner Normandy. In the field of transport, Tesla is more commonly identified with antigravity flight and UFOs. Although this identification is based upon nothing more than a few public utterances, his suggestions charge the imagination with possibilities. High-frequency railway Tesla's high-frequency, high-potential railway picks up its power inductively without the use of the rolling or sliding contacts used in conventional trolley or third-rail systems. A pickup bar travels near a cable carrying the oscillating energy. This cable, which Tesla specifically invented to carry such currents, is the precursor of the grounded shielded cable used today to carry TV and other high-frequency signals. But unlike today's cables, which carry energy only of signal strength and shield by means of a continuous grounded static screen of fine braided copper wire, Tesla's high voltage cable uses metal pipe or screen that is broken up into short lengths, very much shorter, says Tesla in his patent, than the wave lengths of the current used. This feature reduces loss. Since the shielding must not be interrupted, the short sections are made to overlap but are insulated from one another. To further reduce loss to ground, an inductance of high ohmic resistance or a small capacity is placed in the ground line. Motor mystery A conundrum raised by Tesla's railway patent is that the vehicle is powered by an electric motor, but nowhere among Tesla's inventions is to be found an electric motor that runs off of high-frequency currents. Was Tesla planning to use a lower frequency here, something under 1,000 cycles? Did he have a converter in mind that could bring the frequency down? Or did Tesla invent a high-frequency motor that never made it into patent, an invention that may be among his unpublished notes? Anyway, Tesla proceeds in many of his discussions of high-frequency power as if this problem were solved. I've seen references post-Tesla to the existence of such a motor. Free-energy inventor, Hermann Plauson, (next chapter) refers to high-frequency motors. These motors have magnetic cores made of very thin laminations insulated from each other, a design that would limit damping effects.

Advances in helicopter design may have mitigated some of these problems, but at least the last one still holds true: Tesla's craft, which has a large wing area, is powered by two disk turbines, rotating in opposite directions. The engineering problem of swinging the pilot and passengers around 90 degrees after takeoff, is solved at least to Tesla's satisfaction. There have been some experimental VTOL's but nothing in production. Electric flight Tesla's dream electric aircraft would be powered by means of magnifying transmitters: Aerial machines will be propelled around the earth without a stop. Also, in 1900, he predicted a cold coal battery with such output that a practical flying machine would be possible. Such a battery also would enormously enhance the introduction of the automobile. Tesla fantasized a personal aerial taxi which could be folded into a six-foot cube, and would weigh under 250 lb.: It can be run through the streets and put in a garage, if desired, just like an automobile. Explaining how his earth-resonant wireless-power system could energize vehicles aloft, he said, power can be readily supplied without ground connection, for, although the flow is confined to earth, an electromagnetic field is created in the atmosphere surrounding it. Tesla believed such a system to be the ultimate method of man- made flight: With an industrial plant of great capacity, sufficient power can be derived in this manner to propel any kind of aerial machine. This I have always considered the best and permanent solution to the problems of flight. No fuel of any kind will be required as the propulsion will be accomplished by light electric motors operated at great speed. Antigravity Tesla wrote in 1900 of an antigravity motor: Imagine a disk of some homogeneous material turned perfectly true and arranged to turn in friction less bearings on a horizontal shaft above the ground. Now, it is possible that we may learn how to make such a disk rotate continuously and perform work by the force of gravity. To do so, he said, we have only to invent a screen against this force. By such a screen we could prevent this force from acting on one-half of the disk, and rotation of the latter would follow. Does it not follow then, that such a gravity screen could also be used to levitate a vehicle? Tesla held no patent on such a device or on any other antigravity device, and there are no published notes on experimentation in the area. Nevertheless, Tesla inevitably pops up in the literature of antigravity and UFOs. This may be because Tesla was a prominent exponent of a physics in which antigravity seems more feasible because gravity is better explained. A researcher-theorist of today, Thomas Bearden, allows for gravity control in the physics he calls the new Tesla electromagnetic. Scalar (standing) waves in time itself can be produced electrically and this becomes a magic tool capable of directly affecting and altering anything that exists in time, including gravitational fields, says Bearden. In 1931 the editor of Science And Mechanics, Hugo Gernsback reported, It is believed by many scientists today that the force of gravitation is merely another manifestation of electromagnetic waves. Edward Farrow, a New York inventor, reported in 1911 an antigravity effect produced by a ring of spark gaps. When the gaps were fired, the device, called a condensing dynamo, lost one-sixth of its weight. T. Henry Moray wrote, Frequencies may be developed which will balance the force of gravity to a point of neutralization. Antigravity researcher Richard Lefors Clark places the frequency of gravity's vibrations right at Nature's neutral center in the radiant energy spectrum, above radar and below infrared, at l0 12 cycles per second. http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (20 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla 8. Free-Energy Receiver For starters, think of this as a solar-electric panel. Tesla's invention is very different, but the closest thing to it in conventional technology is in photovoltaic. One radical difference is that conventional solar-electric panels consist of a substrate coated with crystalline silicon; the latest use amorphous silicon. Conventional solar panels are expensive, and, whatever the coating, they are manufactured by esoteric processes. But Tesla's solar panel is just a shiny metal plate with a transparent coating of some insulating material, which today could be a spray plastic. Stick one of these antenna-like panels up in the air, the higher the better, and wire it to one side of a capacitor, the other going to a good earth ground. Now the energy from the sun is charging that capacitor. Connect across the capacitor some sort of switching device so that it can be discharged arrhythmic intervals, and you have an electric output. Tesla's patent is telling us that it is that simple to get electric energy. The bigger the area of the insulated plate, the more energy you get. But this is more than a solar panel because it does not necessarily need sunshine to operate. It also produces power at night Of course; this is impossible according to official science. For this reason, you could not get a patent on such an invention today. Many an inventor has learned this the hard way. Tesla had his problems with the patent examiners, but today's free-energy inventor has it much tougher. Tesla's free-energy receiver was patented in 1901 as An Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy. The patent refers to the sun, as well as other sources of radiant energy, like cosmic rays. That the device works at night is explained in terms of the nighttime availability of cosmic rays. Tesla also refers to the ground as a vast reservoir of negative electricity. Tesla was fascinated by radiant energy and its free-energy possibilities. He called the Crooke's radiometer (a device which has vanes that spin in a vacuum when exposed to radiant energy) a beautiful invention. He believed that it would become possible to harness energy directly by connecting to the very wheelwork of nature. His free-energy receiver is as close as he ever came to such a device in his patented work. But on his 76 th birthday at the ritual press conference, Tesla (who was without the financial wherewithal to patent but went on inventing in his head) announced a cosmic-ray motor. When asked if it was more powerful than the Crooke's radiometer, he answered, thousands of times more powerful. how it works From the electric potential that exists between the elevated plate (plus) and the ground (minus), energy builds in the capacitor, and, after a suitable time interval, the accumulated energy will manifest itself in a powerful discharge which can do work. The capacitor, says Tesla should be of considerable electrostatic capacity and its dielectric made of the best quality mica, for it has to with stand potentials that could rupture a weaker dielectric. Tesla gives various options for the switching device. One is a rotary switch that resembles a Tesla circuit controller. Another is an electrostatic device consisting of two very light, membranous conductors suspended in a vacuum. These sense the energy buildup in the capacitor, one going positive, the other negative, and, at a certain charge level, are attracted, touch, and thus fire the capacitor. Tesla also mentions another switching device consisting of a minute air gap or weak dielectric film, which breaks down suddenly when a certain potential is reached. The above is about all the technical detail you get in the patent. Plauson's converter Tesla's invention may have helped to inspire the many other inventors who have worked in the field of free energy. At least a dozen are on record. Let's look at one in particular. In 1921 Hermann Plauson, a German experimenter, succeeded in obtaining patents, including one in the U. S., for Conversion of Atmospheric Electric Energy. In school, every introduction to electricity touches on the phenomenon of so-called static (or electrostatic) electricity, and this is what Plauson means by atmospheric. Static electricity is built-up charge, http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (21 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla electricity in a raw state, and it comes easy in Nature, as evidenced by lightning and the aurora borealis. If you have ever seen a frictional static machine in operation, it's not difficult to imagine the tremendous potential in artificially produced static. A rotating disk type of static machine or the silk belt type, as in the Van de Graff generator, produces discharges like those from a tesla coil. Unfortunately, in school, the subject of static electricity is briefly touched upon and then abruptly dropped, never to be mentioned again. Electrical power sources thereafter are limited to the battery or the wall socket. How it works In the Plauson drawing the free energy converter on the left interfaces with a disk type static machine via special pick up combs. When the static collecting disk is rotated, the combs pick up the charge, one comb going positive, and the other negative. The combs, in turn, charge up their respective capacitors until sufficiently high potential builds to jump the spark gap. The oscillatory discharge is induced into the transformer primary. This is high-voltage, high frequency electric energy. The familiar spark-gap oscillator has turned charge into dynamic energy. The transformer steps down the vibrating high voltage to practical levels to power lighting, heating, and special high-frequency motors. The Plauson patent drawing shows a device that works on the same principle but collects energy by means of an antenna, as does Tesla's receiver. Since the higher the antenna the better, and the more area the better, Plauson favors big metallic helium balloons. Plauson says the safety gap, which has three times the resistance of the working gap, is absolutely necessary for collecting large quantities of charge. The capacitors across the gaps in the series safety gap allow for uniform sparking. Plauson's device suggests that Tesla's might be explained in terms of electrostatics. Tesla, at the press conference honoring his 77 th birthday in 1933 declared that electric power was everywhere present in unlimited quantities and could drive the worlds machinery without the need of coal, oil, gas, or any other fuels. A reporter asked if the sudden introduction of his principle wouldn't upset the present economic system... Tesla replied, \"It is badly upset already.\" END http://www.frank.germano.com/lostinventions.htm (22 of 23) [10/02/03 10:42:59 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Tesla and Schauberger based Technology; International Turbine And Power, LLC International Turbine & Power, LLC Bladeless Disk, Vortex & Implosion Technologies Welcome to the most exciting part of this website.

The Tesla Turbine itself, is a very simple device, consisting http://www.frank.germano.com/thecompany.htm (1 of 7) [10/02/03 10:44:40 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Tesla and Schauberger based Technology; International Turbine And Power, LLC of basically, a number of very thin disks, mounted on a shaft, with their centers cut out in sections...this assembly is then enclosed in an air tight case. Pure simplicity. The turbine is powered by steam or combustion gas; virtually any combustible fuel will work. Tesla's steam turbine (an 18\" diameter unit) was documented at achieving a 68% efficiency level, with an output of 330 HP. With a \"multi - stage\" turbine, Tesla hoped to achieve a 97% efficiency level, with an output of well over 1,000 HP. Tesla's only limiting factor was a shaft and case incapable of withstanding the forces. With our current modern technology, this is no longer an issue. Such a machine is a \"thermodynamic transformer\" of an activity surpassing, by far, that of any other prime mover, it being demonstrated in practice that each single disk of the rotor is capable of performing as much work as a whole bucket-wheel of a conventional turbine. Besides, a number of other advantages, equally important, make it especially adapted for operation as an internal combustion motor. With our patent pending Thermodynamic Transformer (BDT TT) engine design, as well as our patented Tesla/Schauberger type Pump system - our \"Centrifugal Molecular Pump\"® (CMP) , our newest line - the patent pending \"Centrifugal Molecular Turbine ®\" (CMT) , and our \"Fresh-Cool®\" Air conditioning and Heat-Pump Systems , and our revolutionary \"InVAID®\" (Vortex Accelerated Implosion Drive), and \"Mighty-tiny TT\" Water Powered Systems , we are in a position to offer GLOBAL energy solutions. All of our systems use environmentally sensible and sustainable technology. Our mission statement - \"Bringing fresh air and fresh ideas to a dying planet.\" ITP is actively seeking investors and interested partners to join with us thus allowing the introduction of this amazing technology to the world.

This is not only happening in the United States, but appears World-Wide. We have relied on outdated forms of \"prime movers\" and inefficient forms of power generation and supply for nearly a century. The technology, in the form of the original Tesla Bladeless Boundary Disk Turbine, was applicable in Tesla's time...it is not only beneficial, but may be critical to implement this technology in OUR time! Everyone hears the buzzwords - \"decentralized power stations\"...I do not have the space here to amplify on the exact definition, however, it is quite probably the most cost effective solution to our current electrical energy situation. Small, efficient \"powerhouses-in-a-hat\" (the term coined by the media of Tesla's day for the Tesla Turbine) will be employed in towns, communities, groups of houses, and around large cities, augmenting the current Utilities. We (ITP) are in the enviable position of being quite able to assist end consumers in this energy crisis. ITP's BDT TT engine has a weight to output horse power ratio of up to an unbelievable 10 HP per pound. It has the ability to run on almost any fuel. It is incredibly compact and lightweight. Pollution output from the exhaust of even the propane version is FAR below that of even today's best standard engines. The system also lends itself in use as an \"air to air\" refrigeration system without the need for harmful Freon gasses. The engine, by its very nature of operation is perfectly suited to \"Turbo/Electric\" applications. The BDT-TT engine is unequaled in it's simplicity and output, far exceeding any other conventional engine to date. Almost a quarter of the air pollution today comes from the coal being burned to generate electricity. Fuel consumption, resulting in air pollution and acid rain, could be significantly reduced simply by replacing the conventional blade steam turbines currently used by utilities with the Bladeless Tesla Steam Turbine (ITP BDT). This also would have the added bonus of drastically reducing maintenance. But the real solution lies in using low temperature wet steam occurring naturally from the ground in the form of geothermal energy . This energy would destroy a conventional bladed steam turbine, unless expensive steam drying is employed. However, the Bladeless Tesla Steam Turbine (ITP BDT) requires no drying and can be connected directly to the geothermal source . It has been estimated that the geothermal potential in just Southern California alone , could power the entire North American Continent with NO POLLUTION! Add to this the large geothermal potential of Wyoming (think of the geysers in \"Yellowstone National Park\" - that's geothermal energy), Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana, and you will begin to get the picture of the enormous geothermal potential available in the Northwestern states alone. Large oil companies have comprehended the potential of geothermal energy and have purchased many of these large tracks of prime geothermal land. Due to the revolutionary concepts embodied in this engine, we can easily end the so called energy crisis and dramatically reduce pollution. Even the vested energy interests are beginning to understand that now is the time for change, realizing their future health and wealth is directly linked to that of the environment. Environmentally sensible usage of available resources - \"some fresh air for a dying planet\"; ITP's credo. There are a number of individuals and young companies now interested in building and designing Tesla-type engines. Many have their own approaches to design. One thing to keep in mind is this: follow Tesla's designs first, and after achieving a working, efficient engine design, then begin modifying. Far too many builders have claimed that the Tesla Turbine is somehow \"faulty,\" or flawed... however, upon examination, it is clear that it was the builders mistakes and/or changes that caused the failure of being unable to attain Tesla's amazing results. I began this venture with the premise that the Tesla design was absolutely correct, and that by following the patent information faithfully, we would end up with a working turbine. That has proved more than true. Industry will almost definitely be forced to look further at our engine, as it will soon present itself to be a \"best available technology.\" When that day comes, as it certainly will, International Turbine And Power will be capable of implementing the engine into commercial use.

This remarkable turbine does away with all the troubles and complexity to the former attempted types. Stated briefly, the invention consists in the production of a peculiar shape conduit, thru which the gases are admitted into the turbine, and which has the singular property of permitting their passage in that direction only; in other words, uni-directionally. This device when used in conjunction with the bladeless turbine produces an engine which may be explosively operated by gasoline, alcohol, or other fuels and is absolutely devoid of all valves. It is the simplest internal combustion motor conceivable. Owing to the tremendous output of the turbine, one single disk being practically equivalent in performance to a whole bucket wheel, a very small machine of this kind is capable of developing an astonishing amount of power... The upper part of the turbine casing has bolted to it a separate casting, the central cavity of which forms the combustion chamber. To prevent injury thru excessive heating, a water jacket may be used, of else water injection, or air cooling, this all the more readily as very high temperatures are practicable. The top of the casting is closed by a plate with a spark-plug inserted and in it's sides are screwed two of the valvular conduits communicating with the central chamber. One of these is , normally, open to the atmosphere while the other connects to the fuel source. The bottom of the chamber terminates in a suitable nozzle which consists of separate member of heat-resisting material. To regulate the influx of the explosive constituents and secure the proper mixture the air and gas conduits are equipped with regulating valves. The exhaust openings are in communication with a ventilator...\" Quotes from Nikola Tesla, circa 1911... \"It is a radical departure in the sense that its success would mean the abandonment of the antiquated types of prime movers on which billions of dollars have been spent. Under such circumstances the progress must needs be slow and perhaps the greatest impediment is encountered in the prejudicial opinions created in the minds of experts by organized opposition.\" \"I have developed 110 horsepower with disks nine and three quarter inches in diameter and making a thickness of about two inches. Under proper conditions the performance might have been as much as 1,000 horsepower. In fact there is almost no limit to the mechanical performance of such a machine. This engine will work with gas, as in the usual type of explosion engine used in automobiles and airplanes, even better than it did with steam. Tests which I have conducted have shown that the rotary effort with gas is greater than with steam.\" \"It is the lightest prime mover ever produced and can be operated without trouble at red heat, thereby obtaining a very high economy in the transformation of energy.\" Click here for the Nikola Tesla and Viktor Schauberger Bookstore, from \"AMAZON.COM\" NIKOLA TESLA: http://www.frank.germano.com/thecompany.htm (6 of 7) [10/02/03 10:44:40 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"http://www.frank.germano.com/images/wardencliff.gif http://www.frank.germano.com/images/wardencliff.gif [10/02/03 10:59:03 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"http://www.frank.germano.com/images/tesla1c.jpg http://www.frank.germano.com/images/tesla1c.jpg [10/02/03 10:59:28 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"http://www.frank.germano.com/images/worldwireless.gif http://www.frank.germano.com/images/worldwireless.gif [10/02/03 10:59:43 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"http://www.frank.germano.com/images/teslacoil1.jpg http://www.frank.germano.com/images/teslacoil1.jpg [10/02/03 10:59:58 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"http://www.frank.germano.com/images/teslacoil2.jpg http://www.frank.germano.com/images/teslacoil2.jpg [10/02/03 11:00:01 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"http://www.frank.germano.com/images/pikespeaklab.gif http://www.frank.germano.com/images/pikespeaklab.gif [10/02/03 11:00:08 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"http://www.frank.germano.com/images/teslaatwork_coil.gif http://www.frank.germano.com/images/teslaatwork_coil.gif [10/02/03 11:00:33 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"http://www.frank.germano.com/images/tower_destruction.jpg http://www.frank.germano.com/images/tower_destruction.jpg [10/02/03 11:01:00 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"http://www.frank.germano.com/images/warden_today.jpg http://www.frank.germano.com/images/warden_today.jpg [10/02/03 11:01:10 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"http://www.frank.germano.com/images/Charlie%20disk%20pack.jpg http://www.frank.germano.com/images/Charlie%20disk%20pack.jpg [10/02/03 11:06:32 p.m.]"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"http://www.frank.germano.com/images/CMP2%20PUMP2%20open.jpg http://www.frank.germano.com/images/CMP2%20PUMP2%20open.jpg [10/02/03 11:06:58 p.m.]"}]
