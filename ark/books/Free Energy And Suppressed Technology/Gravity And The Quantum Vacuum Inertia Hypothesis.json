Sp eci\fcally , in the previously cited work, the prop erties of the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum as exp erienced in a Rindler constan t acceleration frame were investigated, and the existence of an energy-momen tum \rux was disco vered whic h, for con venience, we call the Rindler \rux (RF). The RF, and its relativ e, Unruh-Da vies radiation, both stem from event-horizon e\u000bects in accelerating reference frames. The force of radiation pressure pro duced by the RF pro ves to be prop ortional to the acceleration of the reference frame, whic h leads to the hypothesis that at least part of the inertia of an object should be due to the individual and collectiv e interaction of its quarks and electrons with the RF. We call this the quantum vacuum inertia hyp othesis . We demonstrate that this approac h to inertia is consisten t with general relativit y (GR) and that it answ ers a fundamen tal question left open within GR, viz. is there a physical mec hanism that generates the reaction force kno wn as weigh t when a speci\fc non-geo desic motion is imp osed on an object? Or put another way, while geometro dynamics dictates the spacetime metric and thus speci\fes geo desics, is there an iden ti\fable mec hanism for enforcing the motion of freely-falling bodies along geo desic tra jectories? The quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis pro vides suc h a mec hanism, since by assuming the Einstein principle of local Loren tz-in variance (LLI), we can immediately sho w that the same RF arises due to curv ed spacetime geometry as for acceleration in \rat spacetime. Th us the previously deriv ed expression for the inertial mass con tribution from the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum \feld is exactly equal to the corresp onding con tribution to the gra vitational mass, m g . Therefore, within the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum viewp oin t prop osed in [1,2], the Newtonian weak equiv alence principle, m i = m g , ensues in a straigh tforw ard manner. In the weak \feld limit it can then also be sho wn, by means of a simple argumen t from poten tial theory , that because of geometrical reasons the Newtonian gra vitational force law must exactly follo w. This elemen tary analysis however does not pin down the exact form of the gra vitational theory that is required but only that it should be a theory of the metric type, i.e., a theory like Einstein's GR that can be interpreted as curv ature of spacetime. While the presen t analysis sho ws that our previous quan tum vacuum inertial mass analysis is consisten t with GR, the extension of these two analyses to comp onen ts of the quan tum vacuum other than the electromagnetic comp onen t, i.e. the strong and weak vacua, remains to be done. 1. INTR ODUCTION Using the semiclassical represen tation of the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum em bodied in Sto chastic Electro dynamics (SED), it has been sho wn that a con tribution to the inertial mass, m i , of an object must result from the interactions of the quan tum vacuum with the electromagnetically-in teracting particles (quarks and electrons) comprising that object [1,2]. Sp eci\fcally , the prop erties of the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum as measured in a Rindler constan t acceleration frame were investigated, and the existence of an energy-momen tum \rux was disco vered whic h, for con venience, we now call the Rindler \rux (RF). The RF, and its relativ e, Unruh-Da vies radiation, both stem from event-horizon e\u000bects in accelerating reference frames. Ev ent horizons create an asymmetry in the quan tum vacuum radiation pattern. 1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The force of radiation pressure on a massiv e object pro duced by the RF pro ves to be prop ortional to the acceleration of the reference frame attac hed to the object. This leads naturally to the hypothesis that at least part of the inertia of an object is due to the acceleration-dep enden t drag force that results from individual and collectiv e interactions of the quarks and electrons in the object with the RF. For simplicit y of reference, we refer to this concept, and an earlier deriv ation of a similar result using a completely di\u000beren t approac h (in volving a perturbation tec hnique due to Einstein and Hopf on an accelerating Planc k oscillator [3]), as the quantum vacuum inertia hyp othesis . SED is a theory that includes the e\u000bects of the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum in physics by adding to ordinary Loren tzian classical electro dynamics a random \ructuating electromagnetic bac kground constrained to be homogeneous and isotropic and to look exactly the same in every Loren tz inertial frame of reference [4,5]. This replaces the zero homogeneous bac kground of ordinary classical electro dynamics. It is essen tial that this bac kground not change the laws of physics when exc hanging one inertial reference system for another. This translates into the requiremen t that this random electromagnetic bac kground must have a Loren tz invarian t energy densit y spectrum. The only random electromagnetic bac kground with this prop ert y is one whose spectral energy densit y, \u001a ( ! ), is prop ortional to the cub e of the frequency , \u001a ( ! ) d! \u0018 ! 3 d! . This is the case if the energy per mo de is \u0016 h!= 2 where ! is the angular frequency . (The \u0016 h!= 2 energy per mo de is of course also the minim um energy of the analog of an electromagnetic \feld mo de: a harmonic oscillator.) The spectral energy densit y required for Loren tz invariance is thus iden tical to the spectral energy densit y of the zero-p oin t \feld of ordinary quan tum theory . For most purp oses, including the presen t one, the zero-p oin t \feld of SED ma y be iden ti\fed with the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum. Ho wever SED is essen tially a classical theory since it presupp oses only ordinary classical electro dynamics and hence SED also presupp oses special relativit y (SR). According to the weak equiv alence principle (WEP) of Newton and Galileo, inertial mass is equal to gra vitational mass, m i = m g . If the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis is correct, a very similar mec hanism involving the quan tum vacuum should also accoun t for gra vitational mass. This novel result, restricted for the time being to the electromagnetic vacuum comp onen t, is precisely what we sho w in x 2 by means of formal but simple and straigh tforw ard argumen ts requiring physical assumptions that are uncon tro versial and widely accepted in theoretical physics. In x 3 the consistency of this argumen t with so-called metric theories of gra vit y (i.e. those theories characterized by spacetime curv ature) is exhibited. In addition to the metric theory , par exc ellanc e , Einstein's GR, there is the Brans-Dic ke theory and other less well kno wn ones, brie\ry discussed by Will [6]. x 4 brie\ry discusses a non-metric theory . Nothing in our approac h poin ts to any new discriminan ts among the various metric theories. Nev er- theless, our quan tum vacuum approac h to gra vitational mass will be sho wn to be entirely consisten t with the standard version of GR. Next, in x 5, we tak e adv antage of geometrical symmetries and presen t a short argumen t from standard poten tial theory to sho w that in the weak \feld limit a Newtonian inverse square force must result from our approac h. A new persp ectiv e on the origin of weigh t is presen ted in x 6. In x 7 we discuss an energetics asp ect, related to the deriv ation presen ted herein, and resolv e an apparen t parado x. A brief discussion on the nature of the gra vitational \feld follo ws in x 8, but we infer that the presen t dev elopmen t of our approac h does not pro vide any deep er or more fundamen tal insigh t than GR itself into the abilit y of matter to bend spacetime. We presen t conclusions in x 9. A full dev elopmen t within GR is left for the accompan ying article [7]. 2. ON WHY THE ELECTR OMA GNETIC VACUUM CONTRIBUTION TO GRA VIT ATIONAL MASS IS EXA CTL Y THE SAME AS FOR INER TIAL MASS Table 1 compares the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis with the standard view on mass. We intend to sho w { in this and a companion pap er [7] { not only that the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis is consisten t with GR, but that it answ ers an outstanding question regarding a possible physical origin of the force manifesting as weigh t. We also intend to sho w that just as it becomes possible to iden tify a physical pro cess underlying the f =m a postulate of Newtonian mec hanics (as well as its extension to SR [1,2]), it is possible to iden tify a parallel physical pro cess underlying the weak equiv alence principle, m i = m g , viz. interaction of matter with the RF. Within the standard theoretical framew ork of GR and related theories, the equalit y (or prop ortionalit y) of inertial mass to gra vitational mass has to be assumed. It remains unexplained. As correctly stated by 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Rindler [8], \\the prop ortionalit y of inertial and gra vitational mass for di\u000beren t materials is really a very mysterious fact.\" Ho wever here we sho w that { at least within the presen t restriction to electromagnetism { the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis leads naturally and inevitably to this equalit y. The interaction between the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum and the electromagnetically-in teracting particles constituting any physical object (quarks and electrons) is iden tical for the two situations of acceleration with resp ect to constan t velo city inertial frames or remaining \fxed above some gra vitating body with resp ect to freely-falling local inertial frames. A related theoretical lucuna involv es the origin of the force whic h manifests itself as weigh t. Within GR theory one can only state that deviation from geo desic motion results in a force whic h must be an inertia reaction force. We prop ose that it is possible in principle to iden tify a mec hanism whic h generates suc h an inertia reaction force, and that in curv ed spacetime it acts in the same way as acceleration does in \rat spacetime. Begin by considering a macroscopic, massiv e, gra vitating object, W , whic h is \fxed in space and for simplicit y we assume to be solid, of constan t densit y, and spherical with a radius R , e.g. a planet-lik e object. At a distance r >> R from the cen ter of W there is a small object, w , that for our purp oses we ma y regard as a poin t-lik e test particle. A constan t force f is exerted by an external agen t that prev ents the small body w from falling into the gra vitational poten tial of W and thereb y main tains w at a \fxed poin t in space above the surface of W . Exp erience tells us that when the force f is remo ved, w will instan taneously start to mo ve toward W with an acceleration g and then con tin ue freely falling toward W . Next we consider a freely falling local inertial frame I \u0003 (in the customary sense giv en to suc h a local frame [6]) that is instan taneously at rest with resp ect to w . At w prop er time \u001c , that we select to be \u001c = 0, object w is instan taneously at rest at the poin t ( c 2 =g; 0 ; 0) of the I \u0003 frame. The x -axis of that frame goes in the direction from W to w and, since the frame is freely falling toward W , at \u001c = 0 object w app ears accelerated in I \u0003 in the x -direction and with an acceleration g w = ^ xg . As argued belo w, w is performing a uniformly-accelerated motion, i.e. a motion with a constan t prop er acceleration g w as observ ed from any neigh boring instan taneously como ving (lo cal) inertial frame. In this resp ect we intro duce an in\fnite collection of local inertial frames I \u001c , with axes parallel to those of I \u0003 and with a common x -axis whic h is that of I \u0003 . Let w be instan taneously at rest and co-mo ving with the frame I \u001c at w prop er time \u001c . So the \u001c parameter represen ting the w prop er time also serv es to parametrize this in\fnite collection of (lo cal) inertial frames. Clearly then, I \u0003 is the mem ber of the collection with \u001c = 0, so that I \u0003 = I \u001c =0 . At the poin t in time of coincidence with a giv en I \u001c , w is found momen tarly at rest at the ( c 2 =g; 0 ; 0) poin t of the I \u001c frame. We select also the times in the (lo cal) inertial frames to be t \u001c and suc h that t \u001c = 0 at the momen t of coincidence when w is instan taneously at rest in I \u001c and at the aforemen tioned ( c 2 =g; 0 ; 0) poin t of I \u001c . Clearly as I \u001c =0 = I \u0003 then t \u0003 = 0 when \u001c = 0. All the frames in the collection are freely falling toward W and when any one of them is instan taneously at rest with w it is instan taneously falling with acceleration g = \u0000 g w = \u0000 ^ xg with resp ect to w in the direction of W . It is not di\u000ecult to realize that w app ears in those frames as uniformly accelerated and hence performing a hyperb olic motion with constan t prop er acceleration g w . This situation is equiv alen t to that of an object w accelerating with resp ect to an ensem ble of I \u001c reference frames in the absence of gra vit y. In that situation, the concept of the ensem ble of inertial frames, I \u001c , eac h with an in\fnitesimally greater velo city (for the case of positiv e acceleration) than the last, and eac h coinciding instan taneously with an accelerating w is not di\u000ecult to picture. But how does one picture the analogous ensem ble for w held stationary with resp ect to a gra vitating body? We are free to bring reference frames into existence at will. Imagine bringing a reference frame into existence at time \u001c = 0 directly adjacen t to w , but whereas w is \fxed at a speci\fc poin t above W , we let the newly created reference frame immediately begin free-falling toward W . We immediately create a replacemen t reference frame directly adjacen t to w and let it drop, and so on. The ensem ble of freely-falling local inertial frames bear the same relation to w and to eac h other as do the extended I \u001c inertial frames used in the case of true acceleration of w . For con venience we intro duce a special frame of reference, S , whose x -axis coincides with those of the I \u001c frames, including of course I \u0003 , and whose y -axis and z -axis are parallel to those of I \u001c and I \u0003 . This frame S sta ys collo cated with w whic h is positioned at the ( c 2 =g; 0 ; 0) poin t of the S frame. For I \u0003 (and for the I \u001c frames) the frame S app ears as accelerated with the uniform acceleration g w of its poin t ( c 2 =g; 0 ; 0). We will assume that the frame S is rigid. If so, the accelerations of poin ts of S su\u000ecien tly separated from the w poin t ( c 2 =g; 0 ; 0) are not going to be the same as that of ( c 2 =g; 0 ; 0). This is not a concern however since 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"we will only need in all frames ( I \u001c , I \u0003 , and S ) to consider poin ts in a su\u000ecien tly small neigh borho od of the ( c 2 =g; 0 ; 0) poin t of eac h frame The collection of frames, I \u001c , as well as I \u0003 and S , corresp ond exactly to the set of frames intro duced in [1]. The only di\u000berences are, \frst, that now they are all local, in the sense that they are only well de\fned for regions in the neigh borho od of their resp ectiv e ( c 2 =g; 0 ; 0) space poin ts; and second, that now I \u0003 and the I \u001c frames are all considered to be freely falling toward W and the S frame is \fxed with resp ect to W . Similarly to [1], the S frame ma y again be considered to be, relativ e to the viewp oin t of I \u0003 , a Rind ler noninertial frame . The lab oratory frame I \u0003 we now call the Einstein lab oratory frame , since now the \\lab oratory\" is local and freely falling. We call the collection of inertial frames I \u001c the Bo yer family of frames as he was the \frst to intro duce them in SED [9]. The relativit y principle as form ulated by Einstein when prop osing SR states that \\all inertial frames are totally equiv alen t for the performance of all physical exp erimen ts.\"[6] Before applying this principle to the freely-falling frames I \u0003 and I \u001c that we have de\fned above it is necessary to dra w a distinction between these frames and inertial frames that are far away from any gra vitating body, suc h as W . The free-fall tra jectories, i.e. the geo desics, in the vicinit y of any gra vitating body, W , cannot be parallel over any arbitrary distance owing to the fact that W must be of \fnite size. This means that the principle of relativit y can only be applied locally . This was precisely the limitation that Einstein had to put on his in\fnitely-extended Loren tz inertial frames of SR when starting to construct GR [6,8,10]. We adopt the principle of local Loren tz invariance, (LLI) whic h can be stated, follo wing Will [6], as \\the outcome of a local nongra vitational test exp erimen t is indep enden t of the velo city of the freely falling apparatus.\" A non-gra vitational test exp erimen t is one for whic h self-gra vitating e\u000bects can be neglected. We also adopt the assumption of space and time uniformit y, whic h we call the uniformit y assumption (UA) and whic h states that the laws of physics are the same at any time or place within the Univ erse. Again, follo wing Will [6] this can be stated as \\the outcome of any local nongra vitational test exp erimen t is indep enden t of where and when in the univ erse it is performed.\" We do not concern ourselv es with physical cosmological theories that in one way or another violate UA, e.g. because they involv e spatial or temp oral changes in fundamen tal constan ts [11]. Lo cally , the freely falling local Loren tz frames whic h we now designate with a subscript L | I \u0003 ;L and I \u001c;L | are entirely equiv alen t to the I \u0003 and I \u001c extended frames of [1]. The free-falling Loren tz frame I \u001c;L locally is exactly the same as the extended I \u001c . Invoking the LLI principle we can then immediately conclude that the electromagnetic zero-p oin t \feld, or electromagnetic quan tum vacuum, that can be asso ciated with I \u001c;L must be the same as that asso ciated with I \u001c . From the viewp oin t of the local Loren tz frames I \u0003 ;L and I \u001c;L the body w is undergoing uniform acceleration and therefore for the same reasons as presen ted in [1] an acceleration-dep enden t drag force arises. These formal arguments demonstr ate that the analyses of of [1,2] which found the existenc e of a RF in an acceler ating refer enc e frame translate and corr esp ond exactly to a refer enc e frame \fxe d above a gravitating body. In the same manner that ligh t rays are deviated from straigh t-line propagation by a massiv e gra vitating body W , the other forms of electromagnetic radiation, including the electromagnetic zero-p oin t \feld rays (in the SED appro ximation) are also deviated from straigh t-line propagation. Not surprisingly this creates an anisotrop y in the otherwise isotropic electromagnetic quan tum vacuum. This is the origin of the RF in the gra vitational case. In [1] we interpreted the drag force exerted by the RF as the inertia reaction force of an object that is being forced to accelerate through the electromagnetic zero-p oin t \feld. Accordingly , in the presen t situation, the asso ciated nonrelativistic form of the inertia reaction force should be f zp \u0003 = \u0000 m i g w (1) where g w is the acceleration with whic h w app ears in the local inertial frame I \u0003 . As sho wn in [1] the coe\u000ecien t m i is m i = \u0014 V 0 c 2 Z \u0011 ( ! ) \u0016 h! 3 2 \u0019 2 c 3 d! \u0015 (2) where V 0 is the prop er volume of the object, c is the speed of ligh t, \u0016 h is Planc k's constan t divided by 2 \u0019 and \u0011 ( ! ), where 0 \u0014 \u0011 ( ! ) \u0014 1, is a function that spectralwise represen ts the relativ e strength of the interaction 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"between the zero-p oin t \feld and the massiv e object whic h acts to opp ose the acceleration. If the object is just a single particle, the spectral pro\fle of \u0011 ( ! ) will characterize the electromagnetically-in teracting particle. It can also characterize a much more extended object, i.e. a macroscopic object, but then the \u0011 ( ! ) will have much more structure (in frequency). We should exp ect di\u000beren t shap es for the electron, a giv en quark, a comp osite particle like the proton, a molecule, a homogeneous dust grain or a homogeneous macroscopic body. In the last case the \u0011 ( ! ) becomes a complicated spectral opacit y function that must extend to extremely high frequencies suc h as those characterizing the Compton frequency of the electron and even beyond. No w, however, what app ears as inertial mass, m i , to the observ er in the local I \u0003 ;L frame is of course what corresp onds to gra vitational mass, m g , and it must therefore be the case that m g = \u0014 V 0 c 2 Z \u0011 ( ! ) \u0016 h! 3 2 \u0019 2 c 3 d! \u0015 : (3) As done in [1], App endix B, it can be sho wn that the righ t hand side indeed represen ts the energy of the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum enclosed within the object's volume and able to interact with the object as manifested by the \u0011 ( ! ) coupling function. A more thorough, fully covarian t dev elopmen t can also be implemen ted to sho w that the force expression of eqn. (1) can be extended to the relativistic form of the inertia reaction force as in [1] , App endix D. (This dev elopmen t also serv ed to obtain the \fnal form of m i giv en above in eqn. (3) eliminating a spurious 4/3 factor.) * Summarizing what we have sho wn in this section is that if a force f is applied to the w body just large enough to prev ent it from falling toward the body W , then in the non-relativistic case that force is giv en by f = \u0000 m g (4) where we have dropp ed the nonessen tial subscripts i and g and sup erscripts, because it is now clear that m i = m g = m follo ws from the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis. 3. CONSISTENCY WITH EINSTEIN'S GENERAL RELA TIVITY The statemen t that m i = m g constitutes the weak equiv alence principle (WEP). Its origin goes bac k to Galileo and Newton, but it now app ears, as sho wn in the previous section, that this principle is a natural consequence of the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis. The strong equiv alence principle (SEP) of Einstein consists of the WEP together with LLI and the UA. Since the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis and its extension to gra vit y allo w us to obtain the WEP assuming LLI and the UA, this approac h is consisten t with all theories that are deriv ed from the SEP . In addition to GR, the Brans-Dic ke theory is deriv ed from SEP as are other other lesser kno wn theories [6], all distinguished from eac h other by various particular assumptions. All theories that assume the SEP are called metric the ories . They are characterized by the fact that they con template a bending of spacetime asso ciated with the presence of matter. Tw o imp ortan t consequences of the LLI-WEP-UA com bination are that ligh t bends in the presence of matter and that there is a gra vitational Doppler shift. Since the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis is consisten t with this same com bination, it would also require that ligh t bends in the presence of gra vitational \felds. This can, of course, be interpreted as a change in spacetime geometry , the standard interpretation of GR. 4. A RECENT AL TERNA TIVE VACUUM APPR OACH TO GRA VITY The idea that the vacuum is ultimately resp onsible for gra vitation is not new. It goes bac k to a prop osal of Sakharo v [12] based on the work of Zeldo vic h [13] in whic h a connection is dra wn between Hilb ert-Einstein * We use this opp ortunit y to correct a minor transcription error that app eared in the prin ted version of Ref. [1]. In App endix D, p. 1100, the min us sign in eqn. (D8) is wrong. It should read \u0011 \u0017 \u0011 \u0017 = 1 (D8) and the corresp onding signature signs in the line just above eqn. (D8) are the opp osite of what was written and should instead read (+ \u0000\u0000 \u0000 ). 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"action and the quan tum vacuum. This leads to a view of gra vit y as \\a metric elasticit y of space\" (see Misner, Thorne and Wheeler [14] for a succinct review of this concept). Follo wing Sakharo v's idea and using the tec hniques of SED, Putho\u000b prop osed that gra vit y could be construed as a form of van der Waals force [15]. Although interesting and stim ulating in some resp ects, Putho\u000b 's attempt to deriv e a Newtonian inverse square force of gra vit y pro ves to be unsuccessful [16,17,18,19] . An alternativ e approac h has recen tly been dev elop ed by Putho\u000b [20] that is based on earlier work of Dic ke [21] and of Wilson [22]: a polarizable vacuum mo del of gra vitation. In this represen tation, gra vitation comes from an e\u000bect by massiv e bodies on both the permittivit y, \u000f 0 , and the permeabilit y, \u0016 0 , of the vacuum and thus on the velo city of ligh t in the presence of matter. This is clearly an alternativ e theory to GR since it does not involv e curv ature of spacetime. So it is not a metric theory of gra vit y. It can be seen that it does not entail the SEP of Einstein. On the other hand, since spacetime curv ature is by de\fnition inferred from ligh t propagation in relativit y theory , the polarizable vacuum gra vitation mo del ma y be lab elled a pseudo-metric theory of gra vitation since the e\u000bect of variation in the dielectric prop erties of the vacuum by massiv e objects on ligh t propagation are appro ximately equiv alen t to GR spacetime curv ature as long as the \felds are su\u000ecien tly weak. In the weak-\feld limit, the polarizable vacuum mo del of gra vitation duplicates the results of GR, including the classic tests (gra vitational redshift, bending of ligh t near the Sun, adv ance of the perihelion of Mercury). Di\u000berences app ear in the strong-\feld regime, whic h should lead to interesting tests. 5. DERIV ATION OF NEWTON'S LA W OF GRA VIT ATION Our approac h allo ws us to deriv e a Newtonian form of gra vitation in the weak-\feld limit based on the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis, local Loren tz invariance and geometrical considerations. In [1] we sho wed how an asymmetry that app ears in the radiation pattern of the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum, when view ed from an accelerating reference frame, leads to the app earance of a non-zero momen tum \rux, the Rindler Flux (RF), opp osing any accelerating object. Individual and collectiv e interaction between the electromagnetically-in teracting particles (quarks and electrons) comprising a material object and the RF generates a reaction force that ma y be iden ti\fed with the inertia reaction force as it has the righ t form for all velo city regimes. In particular in the low velo city limit it is exactly prop ortional to the acceleration of the object. In x 2 we sho wed from formal argumen ts based on the principle of local Loren tz invariance (LLI) that an exactly equiv alen t force must originate when an object is e\u000bectiv ely accelerated with resp ect to free-falling Loren tz frames by virtue of being held \fxed above a gra vitating body, W . We infer that the presence of a gra vitating body must distort the electromagnetic quan tum vacuum in exactly the same way at any giv en poin t as would the pro cess of acceleration suc h that a = \u0000 g . Simple geometrical argumen ts [23] now su\u000ece to sho w that the gra vitational force can only be the Newton inverse-square law with distance (in the weak \feld limit). It has been sho wn ( x 2) that (outside W ) the g \feld of eqn. (4) generated by W has to be cen tral, i.e., cen trally distributed with spherical symmetry around W . It has to be radial, with its vectorial direction parallel to the corresp onding radius vector r originating at the cen ter of mass of W where we locate the origin of coordinates. The spherical symmetry implies that g is radial in the direction \u0000 ^ r , and dep ends only on the r -co ordinate. The \feld is clearly generated by mass. A simple symmetry argumen t, here omitted for brevit y [24], sho ws that indeed if we scale the mass M of W by a factor \u000b then the resulting g must be of the form \u000b g . If M goes to zero, g disapp ears. The mass M must be the source of \feld lines of g , and these \feld lines can be discon tin uous only where mass is presen t. The \feld lines can be neither generated nor destro yed in free space. Since g is the force on a unit mass, we must exp ect that g beha ves as a vector, and speci\fcally that g follo ws the laws of vector addition. Namely , if two masses M 1 and M 2 in the vicinit y of eac h other generate \felds g 1 and g 2 resp ectiv ely , the resulting g at any giv en poin t in space should be the linear sup erp osition g = g 1 + g 2 : (5) Finally , from the argumen t that leads to eqn. (4) we can see that the \feld g must be unbounded, extending essen tially to in\fnit y. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"With all of these considerations, clearly the lines of g must obey the con tin uit y prop ert y outside W . If there is no mass presen t inside a volume, V , enclosed by a surface S , we exp ect that 0 = I S ( V ) g \u0001 n dS = Z V r\u0001 g dV; (6) but since V is arbitrary this tells us that outside the massiv e body W r\u0001 g = 0 ; r > R : (7) In the presence of our single massiv e body, W , but outside that body, g is radial from the cen ter of mass, and therefore from eqn. (7) we conclude that g \u0018\u0000 ^ r 1 r 2 (8) where the restriction r > R is hereafter understo od. Since the \feld g is also prop ortional to the mass M whic h is its origin, we conclude that g must be of the form g = \u0000 ^ r GM r 2 : (9) where G is a prop ortionalit y constan t and from eqn. (4) we have that f = \u0000 ^ r GMm r 2 : (10) whic h is Newton's law of gra vitation. It is remark able that after \fnding the cen tral and radial charater of g by means of the vacuum approac h of our quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis, one can immediately obtain Newtonian gra vitation, an endea vour keenly but unsuccessfully pursued for quite some time from the viewp oin t of the vacuum \felds [12,13,14] and in particular of SED [15,16,17,18, 19] . In this last case (SED), it was prop osed that gra vit y was a force of the van der Waals form, a view whic h has been sho wn to be unsuccessful [19]. 6. ON THE ORIGIN OF WEIGHT We have established that the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis leads to a force in eqn. (10) whic h adequately explains the origin of weigh t in a Newtonian view of gra vitation. Ho w is this consisten t with the geometro dynamic view of GR? Geometro dynamics speci\fes the e\u000bect of matter and energy on an assumed pliable spacetime metric. That de\fnes the geo desics whic h ligh t rays and freely-falling objects will follo w. Ho wever there is nothing in geometro dynamics that poin ts to the origin of the inertia reaction force when geo desic motion is prev ented, whic h manifests in special circumstances as weigh t. Geometro dynamics merely assumes that deviation from geo desic motion results in inertial forces. That is, in fact, true, but as stated is dev oid of any physical insigh t as discussed in detail in [25]. What we have sho wn above is that an iden tical asymmetry in the quan tum vacuum radiation pattern will arise due to either true acceleration or to e\u000bects on ligh t propagation by the presence of gra vitating matter. That iden tical asymmetry leads to iden tical non-zero RFs in the electromagnetic zero-p oin t \feld, whic h generate iden tical forces. In the case of true acceleration, the resulting force is the inertia reaction force. In the case of being held stationary in a non-Mink owski metric, the resulting force is the weigh t, whic h is also the enforcer of geo desic motion for freely-falling objects. 7. A PHANTOM ANOMAL Y Follo wing the reasoning of x 6 one would conclude that at every poin t of \fxed r above W there is an in\ro wing RF. This would seem to imply a con tin uous energy \rux toward and into W , an apparen tly para- doxical situation consisting of quan tum vacuum-originating energy streaming toward W from all directions in space. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The resolution to this apparen t parado x comes from the realization that we are naiv ely summing energy \rows from incompatible reference frames. Tw o observ ers at the same r but 180 degrees apart will rep ort energy \rows in opp osite directions. These energy \rows are locally true, but they come from opp ositely- directed reference frames. Only in a freely-falling frame in whic h all of the energy \ruxes could sim ultaneously be prop erly de\fned could we legitimately simply sum them up. Ho wever it is mathematically improp er and non-ph ysical to add up over vectors de\fned in di\u000beren t reference frames, whic h moreo ver in the presen t case can be said to even be incompatible. For the sak e of de\fniteness, let us locate ourselv es and w not very far away from the surface of W , and for simplicit y let W be perfectly spherical with radius R and homogeneous in densit y. Let the test body w be, as before, much smaller than W and assume that it is prev ented from falling toward W by a supp orting force f as in eqn. (4). We need only realize two facts. The analysis leading to the RF that app ears for w is only consisten t for a giv en freely-falling LLI frame or at most for the Bo yer family of frames I \u001c , where I \u001c =0 = I \u0003 , along the particular straigh t radius vector going from W to w . (For simplicit y of notation we drop the L -index subscript that indicates the localit y of the frames as there is no source of confusion at this poin t.) For example, consider a small body w 0 (resting at the ( c 2 =g; 0 ; 0) poin t of S 0 ) and asso ciated set of frames I 0 \u001c and I 0 \u0003 falling freely toward W and de\fned exactly the same as I \u001c and I \u0003 were de\fned with resp ect to w but whose radius vector of free fall toward W is along the widely di\u000beren t direction that goes from W to w 0 . As occurs with the observ ers of unprimed frames I \u001c and I \u0003 , observ ers in the primed frames I 0 \u001c and I 0 \u0003 also claim there app ears a RF in S 0 along the radial direction or x 0 -axis and hitting the body w 0 in the direction poin ting toward W . But for the primed frame, the unprimed frame's direction of fall toward W is not a direction of any net RF. The rev erse conclusion also holds. For the unprimed frame there is no net RF along the radial direction ( x 0 -axis) of the primed frame. Therefore all this sho ws that those RFs only can be inferred as suc h from a selectiv ely restricted class of LLI frames. The only way we could pro duce a consisten t conclusion about this odd thermo dynamics situation is if we could \fnd a single freely-falling LLI frame from whic h we could sim ultaneously mak e a consisten t conclusion about the nature of all suc h RFs, i.e. a frame from whic h we can de\fne sim ultaneously and hence be able to add up over all those di\u000beren t RFs. Fortunately there exists suc h a frame. Consider W as the sphere of the Earth. As one goes more and more deeply inside, the strength of g decreases. So freely-falling frames ever deep er within the Earth fall with ever smaller accelerations, and at the exact cen ter of mass of the Earth g is exactly zero. We can actually quan tify this in full precision since we have already disco vered that the gra vitational force must go as r \u0000 2 . There is one single freely-falling LLI frame that is a mem ber of all radial families of freely-falling frames and that is the LLI frame exactly at the cen ter of the Earth that we shall call C . From that frame C we can observ e and dra w consisten t conclusions about the nature of all the RFs along all possible radial directions toward the cen ter of W . But C is not only freely falling with exactly zero acceleration, but also has alw ays been at rest at the cen ter of the Earth. Furthermore conclusions made from this freely-falling frame can be univ ersal since it has zero acceleration and, at least from this limited persp ectiv e, can be extended inde\fnitely , i.e. need not be strictly local. Then for that frame, C , we can consisten tly look in all possible radial directions. Consider the direction from the cen ter of W to w . Since w is at a \fxed distance from the cen ter of W and this is \fxed and not mo ving with resp ect to an observ er in C , there cannot be any RF due to quan tum vacuum radiation of C impinging on w , because w does not app ear accelerated as view ed from C . So the RF disapp ears along the particular radial direction. But for that matter, it disapp ears along all radial directions from the cen ter of W and the parado x is resolv ed. The only single frame from whic h a consisten t conclusion referring to all RFs along all possible radial directions from the cen ter of W can be dra wn yields that suc h RFs exactly vanish. The observ er in C does not infer any net radiation in\rux toward W from any direction in space. We also note that any observ er in orbit around W will detect no RF. Suc h an observ er will detect a RF should he attempt to change orbits, i.e. deviate from geo desic motion. Indeed, he must apply a force to overcome the e\u000bect of the RF when he attempts to change orbits. 8. DISCUSSION In ligh t of what has been prop osed herein, what can we elucidate about the nature of the gra vitational \feld? In the low \felds and low velo cities version, or the Newtonian limit, we have seen above that gra vit y 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"manifests itself as the attractiv e force per unit mass, g , of eqn. (9) that pulls any massiv e test body presen t at a giv en poin t in space towards the body W that originates the \feld. Since we assumed the Einstein LLI principle and from this deriv ed the WEP , this, together with the very natural UA of invariance in the laws of physics throughout univ ersal spacetime, lead us to the Einstein SEP whic h necessarily implies the spacetime bending represen tation of the generalized gra vitational \feld [6,8]. A simple though t exp erimen t (Einstein's lift) immediately sho ws that ligh t rays propagate along geo desics, and more speci\fcally along null geo desics [8,14,26]. The spacetime bending is dramatically eviden t when a ligh t ray goes from one side to the other of the freely falling elev ator. For the observ er attac hed to the elev ator's frame that indeed acts as a LLI frame, the ligh t ray propagates in a straigh t line from one side to the other of the elev ator. But for the stationary observ er who sees the elev ator falling with acceleration g , the ligh t ray bends along a path that locally is seen as a parab olic curv e. Undoubtedly the most natu- ral explanation for the stationary observ er is that spacetime bends and therefore the asso ciation that this bending is a manifestation of the gra vitational \feld of W , or rather that this bending of spacetime is the gra vitational \feld itself [26]. Starting from the above fact tak en as a giv en, the various metric theories pro ceed from there to form ulate their equations. In the version of Brans and Dic ke a scalar-tensor \feld is assumed. In Einstein's GR only a tensor \feld is prop osed. Follo wing this maximally simplistic prop osal and guided by general considerations of general covariance (the need of arbitrary coordinates and tensor laws) Einstein was led to his \feld equations in the presence of matter. And then GR naturally unfolded [6,8,14,26] . We have sho wn here that our inertia prop osal of [1] leads us, when limited by the LLI principle, to the metric theories and therefore that it is consisten t with those theories and in particular with Einstein's GR. In addition, there is the follo wing interesting feature of our prop osal. From our analysis in [1], and in particular in App endix B of [1], it was made clear that within the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis there prop osed, the mass of the object, m , could be view ed as the energy in the equiv alen t vacuum electromagnetic zero-p oin t \feld captured within the structure of the object and that readily interacted with the object. This view prop erly and accurately matc hed with the complemen tary view, thoroughly exp osed in other parts of the pap er [1], that presen ted inertia as the result of a vacuum reaction e\u000bect, a kind of drag force exerted by the vacuum \feld on accelerated objects. Quan titativ ely , both approac hes lead to exactly the same inertial mass and moreo ver they were partly complemen tary . Both viewp oin ts were needed. One could not exist without the other. They were the two sides of the same coin. The question is now wh y massiv e objects, when freely falling, also follo w geo desic paths. The tempt- ing view suggested here is that, as massiv e bodies (according to our analysis of [1], App endix B) have a mass that is made of the vacuum electromagnetic energy con tained within their structure and that readily interacts with suc h structure, it is no surprise that geo desics are their natural path of motion during free fall. Electromagnetic radiation has been sho wn by Einstein to follo w precisely geo desic paths. The only di\u000berence now is that, as the radiation sta ys within the accelerated body structure and is con tained within that structure and thereb y its energy cen ter mo ves subrelativistically , these geo desics are just time-lik e and not null ones as in the case of freely propagating ligh t rays. We illustrate this with an example. Imagine a freely-falling electromagnetic cavit y with perfectly re- \recting walls of negligible weigh t, so that all the weigh t is due to the enclosed radiation. A simple plane wave mo de decomp osition sho ws that although individual wavetrains do still mo ve at the speed of ligh t, the cen ter of energy of the radiation inside the cavit y mo ves subrelativistically as the wavetrains re\rect bac k and forth. The wavetrains do indeed propagate along null geo desics, but the cen ter of energy propagates only along a time-lik e geo desic. Neither our approac h nor the con ventional presen tations of GR for that matter, can o\u000ber a physical explanation of the mec hanism of the bending of spacetime as related to energy densit y. Misner, Thorne and Wheeler [14] presen t six di\u000beren t prop osed explanations. The sixth is the one we already men tioned due to Sakharo v [12,13] whic h starts from general vacuum considerations. As our approac h starts also from vacuum considerations, it naturally \fts better the concept of the conjecture of Sakharo v [12] and Zeldo vic h [13] than the other prop osals but it is not inconsisten t with any of them. In particular the strictly formal prop osal of Hilb ert [14] that intro duces the so-called Einstein-Hilb ert Action, is also at the origin of the Sakharo v prop osal. We plan to dev ote more work to exploring the connection of our inertia [1,2] and gra vit y approac h to the approac h prop osed by Sakharo v [12]. This we lea ve for a future publication. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"9. CONCLUSIONS The principal conclusions of this pap er are: (1) Identity of inertial mass with gravitational mass, m i = m g . It has been sho wn that the approac h of [1] con tains this peculiar feature that, so far and as we kno w, has nev er been explained. Rindler [7] calls this feature \\a very mysterious fact,\" as indeed it has been up to the presen t. We exp ect with this work to have shed some ligh t on this peculiar feature. (2) Consistency of the quantum vacuum inertia hyp othesis with Einstein 's GR. We have already com- men ted above, in particular in x 7, on this interesting feature presen ted in x 3 that puts the vacuum inertia approac h of [1] within the mainstream though t of con temp orary gra vitational theories, speci\fcally within that of theories of the metric type and in particular in agreemen t with GR. The full GR dev elopmen t of gra vitation within the scop e of the quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis is presen ted in [7]. (3) Newton 's gravitational law from the quantum vacuum inertia hyp othesis. By means of a simple argumen t based on poten tial theory we sho w how to obtain in a natural way Newton's inverse square force with distance from our vacuum approac h to inertia of [1]. The simplicit y of our approac h con trasts with previous atempts to accomplish this within the framew ork of SED theory [15,16,17,18 ,19 ]. (4) Origin of weight and a physic al me chanism to enfor ce motion along geodesic traje ctories for freely- fal ling obje cts . We have sho wn how this approac h to inertia answ ers a fundamen tal question left open within GR, viz. is there a physical mec hanism that generates the inertia reaction when non-geo desic motion is imp osed on an object and whic h can manifest speci\fcally as weigh t. Or put another way, while geometro- dynamics dictates the spacetime metric and thus speci\fes geo desics, is there an iden ti\fable mec hanism for enforcing motion along geo desic tra jectories? The quan tum vacuum inertia hypothesis represen ts a signi\f- can t \frst step in pro viding suc h a mec hanism. ACKNO WLEDGEMENTS We thank D. C. Cole, Y. Dob yns and M.
