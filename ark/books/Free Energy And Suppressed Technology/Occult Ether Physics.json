Many are worrie d that their own organizations, groups, or re ligions may fall into th is category. Since the w ord \"occult\" merely refers to \"secret\" or \"hidden\", it is used by doctors to describe unknown bacteria as be ing \"occult\". As for a religion, philosophy, organizati on or other group activity, it is a \"cul t\" if it utilizes \"secret teachings\", made known only to a select few initiates or \"priests\". Is it possible that an entire area of physics has been declared virtually \"occult\" an d \"off-limits\" to the public or to private individuals, by a powerful group, so th at all science educati on or data generally available to the public ha s been \"screened\" to elim inate references to it? Is it possible that the act ual science involved in \"electro-propulsion\", has heen replaced with a \"bogus scienc e\", which has been promoted and promulgated to the extent that no one ex cept the 'esoteric elite' knows the truth? And if so, has the \"occult\" science become the exclusive province of a very few specially selected corporate/government \"priests\"? I began studying this controversy—including the science involved— when I was but a child of eight years, in 1946, after intervie wing oil field pumpers who had seen silvery \"flying disk s\" in the remote oil fields in the west Texas and sout hern New Mexico desert. At the age of 13, I spent a couple of days visiting with fa mily friends and their neighbor, astrophysicist Dr. Lincoln La Paz, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. La Paz was then employed by th e U.S. government to help cover up Nazi flying saucer technology brought to Ne w Mexico after WWII. My early convictions were later corroborated wh en I acquired a piece of hardware from a 1943 German flying saucer at Sandia Base where La Paz worked. Since the truth about electropropul sion is based on \"ether\" (A.K.A. \"aether\") physics, which has been collected, hi dden away, or declared \"national security secrets\", or intentionally obliterated by false propaganda which is so intense that the general public remains unaware of the facts which are ri ght under their noses, I have dubbed the ether physics ultimately connec ted to electro-propul sion, \"Occult Ether Physics\". This book is dedicated to the rediscovery of, examination of, and the integration of these secr ets into the public knowledge. The high priests of this occult know ledge are the elit e owners of the coercive monopolist corporate bankin g, industrial, mineral and related interests, who in tu rn allow the initiation of cer tain scientists, military and "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"government officials into their secret teachings only insofar as it is necessary, to execute and maintain a conspiracy of giant proportions, so that the technology can be classified as a \"state secret\" which can be controlled and enforced by means of unconstitutional \"national security laws\", military and civilian legal authority, and police. These measures are intended to protect the archaic techno logy and resources controlled by the elite, from the competition of a truly free market society. Because of the last 76 or more year s of progressively intensifying false propaganda and manipulation of knowle dge and science, a majority of scientists ridicule the concepts of th e existence of an ether and of flying saucers, as if such thinking belonge d in the category of a \"flat earth\" theory and the \"little green men\" from outer space babblings, but the reverse is true. The proponen ts of Relati vism and the Big Bang (the \"Big Bangers\") want you to believe that the universe is finite, so that, if you go \"too far\", you will \"fall off the universe\" , rather than off a \"flat earth\". What's the difference? Flat earth. ..finite universe... they're both dumb theories. And what do the \"little gr een men\" lies have to do with exclusively man-made electric flying machines, and technology based on sound and well-established electrical science and physics, but which, like the existence of the ether, has been tucked away in secret vaults, to keep you from using it, while you are being fe d false and useless \"theor ies\"?

If you believe in re lativism, I should point out that \"time- travel\" is an integral part of that, which is a very incredible impossibility which makes the so-called \"science\" you rely on a worthless piece of pseudo- intellectual crap concocted by someone who wa nted to sabotage your mind 2"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"on behalf of the self-ap pointed high priests of \"Occult Ether Physics\".

The flying saucer is a product of Nikola Tesla's life work, his most fundamentally important invention, for which all his other inventions were in pursuit of, t hough you probably ha ve never heard this fact from anyone else. How do I know? I have documented it in many years of research, tracing Tesla's developmen ts and his own words uttered and published during his lifetime, in scatte red, sparse yet sufficient sources, as he placed a crowning achievement on to p the work of the world's greatest scientific minds of the ni neteenth century, who were Tesla's inspirations. It was supposedly proved, on Ma y 29, 1919, \"...that we live in a curved four-dimensional space-time\". Albert Einste in said a massive body spinning in space \"...wou ld drag space and time around with it...\", the origin of so-called \"fra me-dragging\" and \"space cu rvature\". \"Gravity is no longer a mysterious force acting at a distance but the result of an object trying to travel in a stra ight line through space cu rved by the presence of material bodies\" (Gary Taubes, Relativists in Orbit, Discover , March, 1997). Even such theories...R elativistic bromides interlaced with such phrases as \"the 'fabric' of 'space-time'\", \"space curvature\", and \"frame- dragging\", although off-the-wall flaky, suggest the existen ce of an ether, albeit an erroneous concept of the ether. Since 1919, Nikola Tesla's electro propulsive discoveries have been concealed by government s uppression, theft, and ridicule, while \"science\" has become a pseudo-scientific mathem atical shell-game which bears little new fruit, and less resemb lance to reality. It is time for the truth. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION: NIKOLA TESL A'S ORIGINAL 1875 PLAN Tesla's original vision, in his 1870' s student days, of his \"ideal flying machine\", was of an electropulsive one, the realization of which is why he said he originally entered the field of electrical science in 1875 in the first place. This was the problem which he had assigned to hi mself as his main lifelong work. (Frank Parker Stockbridge, The Tesla Turbine. The World's Work , march, 1912, pp. 543-48.) Originally anticipating that the electrical power needs for an electropropulsive craft would be t oo great for an on- board power plant (since his ship was to be devoid of sustaining planes), he initially embarked on developing his \"wireless tr ansmission of power\" system, so as to transmit the anticipated power needed from ground-based power generators and stations. Some of thes e earlier Tesla ideas turned out to be unnecessary for his flying machine, so he turned them for intended commercial purposes. Since his concepti on of the ether was of a relatively low-density one, and his c onception of the electromagnetic force not nearly so much stronger than the gravitationa l one, his later discovery that his prior anticipation of greater electrical power needs than ac tually required, led to changes in his electropropuls ive craft, and pr oduced plenty of surplus \"spin-off' technology. During the 1920's, at a time when he was in great need of money to complete his electropropulsive shi p, he unsuccessfully attempted to interest the U.S. governmen t in some of th is surplus \"spin off' technology. In an unpublished article prepared but never published, Tesla said: \"...we should push the development of flying machines and wireless transmission of energy without an instant's delay and with all the power and resources of the nation\". The im mediate association here is between \"flying machines\" (not \"aeroplanes\") and \"wir eless transmission of energy\". Tesla had piles of patents wh ich produced him no money, because the Morgans and Rockefellers had declared them off limits. No one could borrow money from the banks to put one of these sy stems into practice, and anyone who was foolish enough to do so on their own money co uld expect the wrath of the gods to come down on them like lightening bolts from Zeus. Due to his imminent discovery that his on-board power needs would not be so great, and a failure to inte rest anyone in the development of his wireless energy transmission system, Tesla obtained a patent in 1913 on a remarkable turbine he had invented about 1909. This was probably in view of encouraging deve lopments and awareness which showed that the "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"electromagnetic interaction is 10 40 times stronger than the gravitational interaction (George Gamow, Gravity, Anchor Books, N.Y. [1962], p. 138). According to Hendrick Lorenz, the electrical a ttractive force is 2 x 10 39 times stronger than the gravitational attractive force. The change in Tesla's strategy seems to have occurred between his 1915 test of an electropropulsive mi ssile using wireless energy projected to it by a power beam from the ground, and his 1934 birthday announcement. These new developments were probably s purred on by the mother of invention, since without a wireless energy system, the prior conception would be rath er useless. The power monopolists could fight that off forever, so Tesla was left to his own devices, unable to count on anyone else. The earlier misconceptions were still somewhat in Tesla's mind when he developed the turbine comme rcially under the Tesla Propulsion Company slogan, \"20 Horsepower Per Pound\", with the undisclosed intention of also using the turbine to drive one of his specially designed high frequency alternators to power the shi p. After having developed such a light and powerful turbine, whic h could turn upwards of 30,000 rpm., with a twenty pound uni t producing over 200 br ake horsepower on gasoline, he also designed and received a patent in 1928 for a new kind of \"VTOL\"-type propellor-driven airplane , to be powered by two turbines mounted in tandem, which would count eract the torque of the prop, and eliminate the need for th e stabilizing props that he licoptors have on their back fuselages. This airc raft, if built, would have had a superior weight- to-horsepower ratio—perhaps three-to -one—and would have been very fast in level flight, taking off vertically. Tesla, on seeing the inne fficient use of heavier aircraft engines then in use, and the requirements of more cumbersome aircraft with greater wing area, apparently wished to commercialize on the turbine by designing and patenting the new airplane, which specifically used his turbine, to raise needed capital to complete his more expensive electropropulsive project. In his experiences with prior patents, he had learned that a patent would be worthless unless he could get the needed capital to carry the project out before the patent period expired, and that the disclosure in a patent would allow others to do so only 17 years after a patent might be granted to him, during which time his invention could languish for lack of f unding on his part, because the mono lithic financial interests were set against him. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"While in the initial stages of de velopment, Tesla seemed quite unaware of the true power of \"the fo rce\", until his earl y field tests of 1915 proved that it was \"tremendous\". In the years 1893 and 1894, Tesla had \"completely worked out\" his Dynamic Theory of Gravity, that is, at least in \"theory\". Inherent to that theor y, was his electropro pulsion system, yet in the formative and theoretical st ages. To publish his theory however, would have been tantamount to disc losing the basic technology as well, which would have allowed his competitors with th e money and resources, to complete and take credit for the most important work of Tesla's life, and the greatest inventio n of mankind. Tesla lack ed the necessary money, and could not raise it. He could not protect himself by patent, until he completed and tested a wo rking model of large enoug h scale to impress the aircraft industry and the government. Fatefully, it was dur ing this time of greatest financial need, wh en he still had the physical stamina to carry the project out, that he was run ragged by bill collectio ns and foreclosures, at the behest of J.P. Morgan and his c ohorts, all with the intent of crushing Tesla because he kept coming up with new electric power systems which made his prior systems obsolete. Si nce the systems would have ruined Morgan and Rockefeller, and since any invention which Tesla marketed for great profit would have allowed hi m the resources to build his energy systems, he had to be crushed. Tesla never seemed to fully realize that Morgan's pseudo-philantropism was nothing more than a scheme to compromise Tesla's contract with hi mself, and a way of falsely inducing Tesla's reliance on others rather than on his own self-reliance. This treatment set Tesla back emotionally as well as financially and technically, and reduced him at one point to a h eap of groveling nerves, literally begging Morgan to make good on his promises, to no avail, but like all truly tragic figures, there was a peripides —a reassertion of the tragic hero's excellent and untarnished Arturian powers—before he passed heroically into the obliv ion of death, as his di scoveries, like the sword Excalibur, sank beneath the waters of the lake of'national security' lies, to the inurement of corporat e greed, coercion and extortion. The only power that Tesla seemed to have left, was that of withholding his discoveries from the wo rld, to protect his secrets from the pilfering paws of the looters, unless he could receive the compensation and credit which he deserved, but that di dn't matter, because they got it all before his corpse was cool , and never paid him so much as a dime for his trouble. After becoming aware of the true power of \"the fo rce\"—one hundred"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"billion thousand trillion thousand tr illion times stronge r than gravity— Tesla began to pursue the idea of an \"on-board\" power system for a manned craft to be used for tran sportation, with his \"wireless transmission of power\" to be relega ted to a robotic, remote controlled, electropropulsive \"missile\", for use in warfare, with electric power to be transmitted to missiles from the gr ound. After a long period of silence following his field testing of a working model of the electrically propelled missile in 1915, Tesla be gan referring to the propelling force as \"tremendous\" in his later announcemen ts which began in the '30's. \"Tremendous\" does not mean something wh ich reacts feebl y, to barely get off the ground, but to something whic h rises with great and astounding force, such as the way I saw a flyi ng saucer perform in 1953...only ten years after Tesla's death. If \"tre mendous\" meant something like an airplane or conventional rocket—a s the CIA/NASA misinformationists have idiotically attempte d to misconstrue— then what would be the word to describe a force which propels a flying saucer at 9,000 mph in three seconds? The words \"means of propulsion\", used by Tesla in his 1940 interview with William L. Laurence of the New York Times, are of the utmost importance for those intere sted in unders tanding both the misinformational conspiracy, as we ll as the scanty documentation of Tesla's concealed discoveries. In their context, these word s denoted an on- board electropropulsive means to be used on his \"ideal\" flying machine, either manned or unmanned, controll ed \"mechanically\" by a pilot on board, or \"remotely by wireless energy\" by a controller from the ground. It did not refer to a \"projectile\" such as a \"pellet\" or \"bullet\", which had no \"propulsion system\", an d was merely \"repelled\" by a gun of some sort, and it did not refer to any kind of \"airplane\"—hence \"flying machine\"— since his machine was to have no wi ngs, ailerons, propellors, or outer appurtenances of any kind. \"Propulsion\" here means an on-board system for perpetuation of motion, by elect romagnetic means, supplied with electrical power by either on-board generator, or by electrical energy and control signals transmitted by power be am from the ground. The idea of interplanetary travel app ealed to Tesla, with the idea that, so long as the electrical energy for pro pulsion could be transmitted from the earth, a space ship would require no fuel tanks. In a letter to his friend and financial supporter B.A. Behrend in the 1930's, Tesla referred cryptically to his electropropulsive discovery: \"What I shall accomplish by that other invention I came specially to see "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"you about, I do not dare to tell you. This is stated in all seriousness.\" Tesla apparently was inferring a plan to di scover \"other worlds\" in outer space with his electrical machines. Tesla realized that all solid bodies contain \"electri cal content\", and that they behave as resonant cavitie s, which interact electromagnetically with rapidly varying electrostatic fo rces and ether to determine their gravitational interactions and moveme nts in space. Thes e theories were tested and confirmed to some de gree in his 1899 Colorado Springs experiments. The U.S. government neve r gave Tesla the time of day, and his great electropropulsive discovery slipped into the eager hands of the Nazi elite, when Wernhe r von Braun acquired an d began development of the \"p2\" project at Los Alamos, New Mexico in 1936, taking the project back to Germany in the fall of 1937, where it was developed at Peenemunde in the Baltic, until these secrets and others were traded to American corporations and the U.S. government in exchange, under Operation Paperclip, just after the armistice, for amnesty for many war criminals, along with an agreement for several thousand people to work for the U.S. government and Amer ican corporations. Anyone having important technical info rmation was protected. The REAL Cover-up Ever since Tesla's saucer discov ery came under the control of the U.S. government in 1945, there has b een in effect a false propaganda program—originally developed by the RSHA Amt VI (Reichsicherheithaupt Amt VI —which translates to \"National Security Agency Division 6\"—the organization within the Gestapo which was invested with the highest secrets of the German Re ich, and which controlled in Nazi Germany the equiva lent to our own UFOlogy, new age, and pseudo-sceptic misinformation dissemination network). The government simply employed the whole Nazi saucer counterintelligence apparatus, and it was some of the original Nazi misinformationists, employed at Holloman A.F.B., New Mexico, who designed and implemented the 1947 \"Roswell Hoax\". Though shadowed with ostensible military and \"national security\" vestiges, this cover-up has been protracted on behalf of a coercive monopolist cor porate state, even since the acquisition of the s ecrets by the Nazis in 1936, for if the technology had gotten even into the hands of priv ate Germans at that time, the Nazi state's days would have been ever much more so shortly numbered. 8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Can you imagine the effect of this kind of transportation in private hands?

"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CHAPTER I: THE OCCUL T ETHER THEORY AND ELECTROPULSION The theory which I espouse in th is book is based on what can be corroborated throughout th e words and developments of Nikola Tesla and their logically construed implic ations, in combination with other special information linked to that, as presented here and in my prior book, Space Aliens From the Pentagon. This theory is close to Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity, and I like to think th at it even makes some corrections that Tesla himself made or would have ma de, had he lived long enough. Like most theories, th is theory is incomple te, may contain errors, and will require further development, tests, correcti ons, and revisions, either by myself of by others in the future. I have stat ed here my basic thinking on the subject up to this time, which has progressed somewhat since my prior book, using my own terminology involving \"Omni Matter\" (A.K.A., \"the Ether\"). If you will notice in my title to this chapter, I have alrea dy created another new word—\"Electropulsion\"— to shorten the word \"Electropropulsion\". Since this book is for the greatly uninformed public, as well as for the researcher, I will make an effort to couch it in layman's terms—for I am myself a layman—and will provide some illustrations where helpful, to give a reasonable grasp of my concepts, rather than a \"quantum mechanical\" mathematical orgy, whic h is usually comb ined with pages of dull equations and numbers wh ich proceed logically from the contradictory and unproven illogical premises whic h are so prized by that ilk. It is as if to say, \"Hey! Look at me Ma , I can do lots of math!\" \"Ether Physics\", by its very nature and name, is subatomic physics, which to me means \"sub-protonic\" and \"sub-electronic\". I am not so concerned with sub-atomic nuclear par ticles per se, but rather with what I believe are the finite building blocks of the proton and electron, which exist within the et her in simpler form. I will le ave all the quarks, muons, mesons, leptons, etc., to the \"Relativistic Quantum Mechanics\" (hence, \"R.Q.M.s\"), and their \"elegant equations\". Characteristics of Basic Ether Particles My basic ether particle is called the \"Omni\", which has a positive nucleus—a \"protette\" called an \"Omnion\" —and a negative sub- 10"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"electron—an \"electrette\" called an \"Omnitron\". As you may have noticed, this scheme is a scaled-dow n version of the basic hydrogen atom, with its proton and electron. Like most atoms, the Omni is normally neutral and in equilibrium, but is much smaller, being ultra-fine. Due to its tiny size and neutrality, it can pass easily thr ough \"solid bodies\" (except the solid bodies are actually passing by and through it), yet it behaves like a solid in respect to high frequency electromagnetic radiation of specific range, from the infra-red through the visible light frequencies, which distur b its equilibrium, yet, th ough we can feel it, it appears to be transparent a nd invisible to the naked eye. Like hydrogen gas, there is some elasticity, due to the compressibility of the magnetic fields , so it is an \"elastic solid\" as Faraday said. Due to the tiny Omni size, so-called \"empty space\" is actually packed almost so lid with this very fine matter, which oscillates at such high frequencies—well beyond that of x-rays —yet the tiny size and normal neutrality allows it to penetrate \"solid mass\"—which is mostly \"space\"(which is also saturated with Omni which must be moved through by a mass to make room for more Omni). Since interstellar 'space' is equiva lent to a vacuum containing little gaseous matter—such as a Lenard tu be in which charges easily move— the Omni in interstellar space is highly conductive, with charges moving freely from body to body, alo ng magnetic lines of force. Omni-packed space is also omnidirectionally interpenetrated by ultra-fine radiation, wh ich is normally in equilibrium, ca lled \"Zero Point Radiation\" (\"ZPR\"). This ZPR constantly \"twangs\" the electron clouds of atomic matter, creatin g the illusion of \"electron orbits\", which are in fact standing waves in the undulatin g layers of electronic clouds surrounding atoms and molecules. Since the matter with which these electron clouds are associated is in constant motion, the clouds are currents, since a \"charge carried around is a current\". The driving force behind the currents is the motion, whic h, so long as uniform, is \"force- free\". Any lost momentum is 'made up' by the ZPR. The Omni has an almost balanced charge-to-mass ratio (\"1:1\"), and responds to both positive and negative impulses. Electros tatic generators provide a good example of the electr ical behavior of the Omni. At sufficiently high voltages, the posit ive and negative dynamic sub-charges are separated by magnetic fields and condensed to form electrons and protons. There is some unknown unde rlying reason why these charges are of specific magnitude, which is ye t to be explained, but the quantum 11"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"theory practically admits that there are subdivisions of basic electrical charges, and that electrons are not \"indivisible\". This the basic bone of contention, since if electrons are divisible, Relativi sm must fall. The \"basic charge\" which has been perceived as that of the electron, appears to be time-related, sin ce electrical current move s at the same speed as light, therefore, the electron charge is probably the quantity of charge accumulated from a discrete number of Omni over some discrete unit of time, which reflects in turn the distance traveled through space of a proton during that time, with the charges actually circulating between the Omni and matter. High voltage force—either in electrical discharg es or in radiation— is necessary to break the Omnion- Omnitron bond. The same principle applies to electropulsion. Strong, high voltage, high frequency negative pulses are necessary to penetrate th e negative Omnitronic cloud barriers, to react with the positive Omnions, to cause the \"inertia resistance\" of the Omni to be \"asserted\" , so as to access its ma ss to be pulled against, to propel a space ship through Omni-packed space, using a microhelical \"screwing\" force of rotating electro magnetic tubules around irrotational, vacuous Omni cores. The tubules are the product of the rotation imparted by magnetic flux to electrical currents, which are co nsolidated by changes in momentum. The great number of Omni per volum e of space represents a much greater density of posit ive matter than normal 'solid' mass possesses, hence the Omni function as \"virtually stationary anchors\" which an electropulsive craft can lock onto to propel itself through space. The Omni 'anchors' are in f act dynamic relative to earth, with a relative velocity of thousands of miles per hour which represen ts the ultimate velocity of the earth through the ether at any given time. Since the \"accessing\" electropulsive force, when in effect, is transmitted at near the velocity of light however , the comparative differen ce in velocity between the Omni and the earth is almost insigni ficant It is practically \"as if the earth is stationary relativ e to the ether, except fo r the effects of so-called gravity. To an effect which travels at 186,000 miles per second, a body traveling at about 20 miles per second is virtually \"at rest\". The difference in density between liquid hydrogen and the Omni, for example, is relative to the difference in size between the hydrogen atom and the tiny Omni, as well as to the volume of space actually occupied by the Omnion in relation to its Omnitron. It can be assumed that a tiny Omnion, being a subdivision of the proton, has a much 12"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"greater density per unit of space, du e to the relative lack of space between the Omni, which assemble to form protons, much like the space between bricks which is filled with mort ar. This 'mortar' is probably some of Tesla's \"insulative fluid\" which \"wets\" positive bodies and •particles', as a \"perfect fluid\". Ju st as the magnitude of the electron charge may be time-relative, the magnitude of the proton may be likewise, being composed of a disc rete number of Omnions accumulated over a discrete period of time. While the Omni is invisible to the eye—because its period of vibration is beyond the visible frequencies—it is not imperceptible. As we move, we can feel th e Omni accelerating, decel erating, or changing directions within our bodies. When running, we feel the resistance (\"inertia\") created within our body, to changes in momentum, as the Omni tubules are forced in different directions or in accelerating or decelerating pathways through the atoms and molecules of our body. Once we reach a constant velocity, we can feel how the microhelices— created by the constant-pitch spins of the Omnitrons—'bore' through the Omni, creating the \"momentum\" which tends to ca rry us along in level and straight lines. Once in cons tant velocity, we must supply only whatever energy is lost through wind or mechanical fric tion, or erratic movement, in order to maintain cons tant velocity. We can also see the effects of the Omni in the behavior of everyday objects—the way they resist changes in move ment, fall, accelerate, gain momentum, tumble, roll, collide, shatter, bounce , or come to rest. I an alogize a solid mass to a flock of geese, maintaining its \"for mation\" (\"shape\"), as it flies through the \"air\" (\"Omni\"): "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The earth and everything on it is m oving through ethe r-filled space, at tremendous speed. In addition, th e earth spins and orbits, which gradually changes the microhelical pa tterns relative to th e polarity of an interpenetrating \"etheric wind\". The magnitude of the so-called \"force of gravity\", measured from the center of mass of a body, is greater at sea level than on top Mt. Everest, where the distance between its center and that of the earth is greater, but this statement—based on Newton's law— -fails to tell us \"why\" gravity exists, what forces create it, or why the force varies \"directly proportional to the masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the dist ance between (the centers of the) two bodies\". Even Newt on explicitly admitted that his laws failed to address causes, and only claimed to mathematically describe effects. \"Electrical content\" is inherent to all solid matter. Atoms contain nuclei composed of posi tive protons and neutral neutrons, composed of protons and electrons. Around these nuc lei are negative \"electrons\". All matter which contains electrostatic ch arges and is in motion, represent \"electric charges carried around\", he nce currents, which create magnetic fields. Since magnetic fields impart rotation to electromagnetic fields, this creates rotatory mi crohelical electromagnetic tubules within bodies, around irrotational vacuou s ether cores. These t ubules are al igned by the relative motion of a body, along the ax is of a uniform or changing movement, and create momentum by \"boring through\" the ether. Since at any given time the pitch and diamet er of a microhelix is constant, it is not a \"vortex\", which involves a logarithmic spiral, either inward or outward. Each time the velocity or direction changes, the microhelical pitch and orientation resists, th en adjusts to th e new momentum. The earth has a minimu m negative surface char ge of approximately 20 esu/cnr (20 electrostatic units per square centimeter). This is an atmospheric phenomenon due in part to the ionizing effects of cosmic radiation, but cannot be explained wit hout reference to the velocity of the earth through the Omni. The re latively non-conducti ve, insulative and dielectric properties of the at mosphere play a part. Beneath the earth's surface charge, the semi-conductive crust contains a vast ocean of surplus electrons. The earth's su rface charge is more or less a constant, due to earth's surface area, varying somewhat by altitude due to the changes in atmospheric pressure and moisture content of the air, as well as the incidence of cosmic radiation and its frequencies. All atoms—including hydrogen—possess net positive charge. This is because the basic positive charge of a proton exceeds the magnitude 14"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"of the basic negative charge of an electron. Hydrogen, with its single proton and single electron, has the highest charge-to- mass ratio and the lowest gravity of all elements. As one moves up the periodic chart of elements, progressively increasi ng in complexity above hydrogen, elements possess progressively lowe r charge-to-mass ratios, since the comparative ratios of electrons matc h the number of only the protons in the nuclei. Since the neutrons are not negative, they add to the positive mass relative to the electron, but cont ribute nothing to electrical charge, and the ratio of neutrons increases up the chart. This leaves an excess positive mass of the earth, the semi-conductive surface of which is capable of receiving and maintaining a large negative charge surplus, mostly brought to earth by the thousands of light ening bolts per second, and retained due to the dielectric and insulative properties of the atmosphere. The constant electrical discharges from the atmosphere are driven by the cosmic motion of the earth, which converts the electrostatic charges to currents. This was conf irmed by H.A. Rowl and's experiment. Since atmospheric gases are insulators, the mostly alkaline, semi- conductive crust of the earth is larg ely an electron d onor material, which maintains a large rese rvoir of negative ch arges insulated by the atmosphere. Cosmic rays striking the rarified light gases of the ionosphere, maintain its po sitive charge. The effect s of gravity also help, since helium and hydrogen, both light, electropositiv e gases, gravitate to the ionosphere. Between the ionosphe re, c. 620 miles above, and the earth's surface, there is a gradient of c. 150 volts/meter, totaling about 176 million volts, creating a considerable electric field, but the electric field extends far beyond the ionosphere . This electric field creates electrical displacement in the Omni within its reach, which is the cause of gravity. The effects of the elect ric field on the Omni is almost instantaneous, since near the speed of light, as the Om ni pass from \"free space\" into mass, where the gravita tional force is exerted downward, toward the source of the electric field. There is no significant gravitational effect of earth's field above this electric field. Since earth's magnetic field encompasses the moon, so does the electric field. When a \"sub-ion\" (the Omni) is placed within an electric field, the sub- negative charge (Omnitr on) is attracted by the positive pole (ionosphere) and repelled by the nega tive pole (earth). The effect of these attractive/ repulsive forces is to \"d isplace\" each Omni, and to place the dielectric atmosphere and the Omni within a strain, so that, 15"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"near the earth, the Omnitronic clouds around each Omnion are forced eccentrically upward, while the ne utral zone would be over 300 miles from earth. The Cause of the Apparent \"Inv erse Square\" Law of Gravity As earth spins, the surface velocity — and atmospheric velocity with it—at any point varies according to its distance from earth's center. An object sitting at sea level moves through the Omni slower than a body on top Mt Everest The voltage potential between the atmospheric gases at higher altitude and the io nosphere is lower, bu t the voltage potential between the atmosphere and the su rface of Mt. Everest is higher. Accordingly, for an object at s ea level, the displacement of the Omnitronic cloud is gr eater, due to the greater total electric field strength. The increase in velocity o ffsets the increase in field effects on the Omni so that the gr avitational force is more or less equalized between low and high altitude fo r objects on th e earth, but the gravitational effects decrease for ai rborne objects beyond the earth's surface charges ab ove Mt. Everest The differences in these electrical potentials illustrates why there are differences in relative displacement of the Omnitronic clouds, within both earth's \"gravity fiel d\", and within bodies movi ng within that field, with a degree of displacement which is directly proportional to difference in so-called \"gravitational forc e\" and the dielectric strain. This comparison shows th at a body at a higher altitude and velocity has a lower gravity because the elec tric field has a lower displacing influence on the Omnitronic cloudlets, and vice-versa. Th is is pertinent to electropulsion, because we must diminish, reverse, magnify and otherwise control this displacement in order to instantly synthesize and control inertia, momentum, and \"gra vity\". The displacement influences the momentum because it affects the vibrating mi crohelical tubules and the way they \"bore\" through etheric space. Since the el ectric field is somewhat blocked out inside solid bo dies, the tubules te nd to drop to concentric rotation, thus transferri ng a downward force to the mass of which they are a part. \"Gravity\" is a product of the re sistance to this change in displacement. The reason why a moving sphere when charged experiences an increase in its \"virtual mass\"—that is, an increase in the work required to move it, but not in its grav ity— is because the \"Faraday cage\" effect of the incr eased charges tends to increase the 16"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"resistance to the movement of the Omni through the mass, affecting the negative charges on the Omni. Since the electric field and its displ acing influence is altered by the difference in dielectric constant within and without solid bodies, the microhelical tubules tend to drop to concentric rotation, thus transferring a downward force to the mass of which they are a part. \"Gravity\" is a product of the resistance to this change in displacement. Microhelical Tubes of Force Due to the cosmic motion of earth, electrostatic, molecular charges become currents, which create magne tic fields within ponderable bodies. The currents and fields in atomic or molecular \"domains\" are unified by momentum or magnetic fields. As a body moves through the ether/Omni field with the earth, there is an \"etheric wind\" effect, which \"blows through\" mass constantly from a regularly changing direction. Since Omnitrons are \"sub-elect rons\", they also reso nate. As the electric content forms pathways through the Omni within the body, the resonant motions of the molecular currents form magnetic fields which impart the microhelical rotation of the plane of polarization around irrotational Omni cores. These microhelical \"tubes\" have \"pitch\" which is determined by the rate of linear movement per second, in conjunction with the diameters of their rotations (or \"waves\") at near the speed of light. These tiny waves have spherical fronts, which can combine to form larger spherical waves. The microhelical tubes of electrom agnetism, having pitch, function like drills, tending to bore straight pa ths at a constant pitch and linear velocity, around the irrotational vacuous Omni cores (consistent with Newton's laws for inertia and moment um). Any change in direction or velocity is met by a resistance (\"in ertia\"). Since all mass is already in motion, it always has momentum. The inertia exhibited by a body at rest relative to earth, is really a product of its momentum, so this inertia is really momentum. Inertia is therefore a resistance of a body to change in its state of momentum. The two wo rds are used in different ways, to define \"relative changes\" in velocity and/or orientation. Since the Omni near the spinni ng earth are subjected to the stronger negative charges and the positive mass of the earth, the Omnions are attracted dow nward, while the Omnitrons around them are repelled upward, forming eccentric 'clo udlets'. For a body (\"at rest\") at 17"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"sea level, as the Omni enter its surface, the effects on the Omni of the electric field of the earth is altered by the change in dielectric constant, forcing the microhelical tubes in the mass to jump down ward to a more concentric rotation, since the densit y and rigidity of the Omni resists such a change. Since the electromagne tic tubes are part of the mass, a downward force is created by the downward pressu re of the Omitrons, which we call \"gravity\". The effect is similar to a water hose carrying a high pressure stream of water. The helical force of the water creates a gyroscopic stability and te nds to straighten it out into a line, with a regular precession. The \"straightening\" action is analogical to the so- called \"gravity force\". This is true no matter which direction the solid body is moving through the et her, because of the re lative speed of the electromagnetic interaction at virt ually the speed of light, and the polarity of earth's electric field. Gravity, therefore, is the product of a body's reaction to the Omni's resistance to a change in its moment um, transferred to a mass due to its difference in dielectric constant, an d its constantly changing movement, orientation and velocity as it moves through uni versal etheric space. In addition to the Omni Matter, all space is omnidirectionally interpenetrated by ubiquitous Ze ro Point Radiation (\"ZPR\"), of extremely high frequencies, power, and density. One scientist has attributed so-called \"b lackbody radiation\" to the ZPR (T.H. Boyer, Derivation of Blac kbody Radiation Spectru m Without Quantum Assumptions, Phys. Rev . 182 [5], pp. 1374-83 [1969]). Boyer also found that a nonlinear dipole can absorb energy from pa rticular modes of the ZPR spectrum (Random Electrodynamics: The theory of classical"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"electrodynamics with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation, Phys. Rev. D 11 [4], pp. 790-808 [1975]). Anothe r scientist claimed to measure the energy density of ZPR at 10 94 gram/cm 3 , for individual fluctuations of random ZPR, on the scale of the Planck length (10 -33 cm.), by means of a standard radiation detector, the frequency response of which was specially altered to extend into the super high fr equency spectrum involved (J.A. Wheeler, Geometrodynamics, Academic Press , N.Y. [1962]). In my last chapter, I deta il the extraction of ZPR energy in the atomic hydrogen process. These particular researches of 1962 to 1975 are ex post facto, coming long after Tesla's great discoveries. They merely re-confirm that, in order for such intense, super high frequency radiation to pass through space, it would require a space literally packed with an even finer ether, consisting of dense, super high fre quency, ultrafine bundles of positive mass, surrounded by sub-el ectronic negative charge s. This combination, like the continously in terlinked tetrahedronal silicon dioxide atoms which make up solid quartz crystals, is capable of reacting to and conducting electromagnetic radiatio n from the infin itely fine in frequency, to the coarsest frequencies, simultaneously in all directions (\"omnidirectionally\"). This dense ma tter behaves as a solid to lower frequency radiation betw een the x-ray spectrum down to the lower infra- red, yet behaves as an all-pervadi ng, interpenetrating and all-wetting \"perfect fluid\", in respect to (the atomic content of) moving solid bodies, the atomic structures of which cont ain so much room that they are mostly \"space\". Electropulsion utilizes ex ternally projected IR -to visible frequency radiation, of very high voltage, to cause the Omni to assert its \"inertia resistance\", combined with low frequency internal waves to create the (polarized) rotatory el ectromagnetic tubules, which instantaneously synthesize momentum, by boring thro ugh the ether-filled space, to propel a spacecraft through it. An Old Wooden Box and a German Inertial Guidance System In 1979, at a Santa Fe flea market , I examined an old wooden box belonging to an elderly Pojoaque man who was employed as a workman in 1937 at a secret project called \"p2\", which was run by Wernher von Braun. The man had built th e box to hold tools used in his job there.

Be low is my drawing of the old box: The following weekend, in the spring of 1979, I went to an Albuquerque salvage company—\"King's Surplus City\"—on east Central, where I often bought militar y surplus things related to my research and inventing, and was pleased to find a very unusual pile of material all stacked in a separate little pile. On top the pile was a device which I immediately recognized as a type of navigational \"compass\" which would be require d on the early flying sa ucers I had witnessed during my back yard sleepouts in Kermit, Texas, between 1949-53, which turned in incremen ts of multiples of thir ty degrees. The device showed thirty-degree in crements, and had 14 contacts—twelve for each of the directions, and two for th e six-volt motor which rotated the compass ring—and the label showed it was manufactured in Nazi Germany by Lizt on Oct. 1, 1943, in lot 127-178 (52 devices), for a project named \"KT-p2\" (\"Kreisel Te ller - p2\", which meant \"Gyrating Saucer - p2\"). The device was called a \"Peiltocht erkompass\" (a \"polar slave compass\"), which was co ntrolled by signals from a \"Meisterkreiselkompass\" (a \"master gyro-compass\"), which means that the device was half of an inertial guidance system.

On discovering 200 celestial guidanc e systems (A.K.A., \"inertial\" guidance systems) deep underground in a salt cave, General Patton was infuriated on being ordere d to destroy these syst ems by his superiors, being unaware of the fact that the technical draw ings and specifications for the systems were alread y in American possession. Development of the systems was im perative for the flying saucer, since a magnetic compass would be worthless due to the \"Faraday cage\" effect of the electric field surrounding the saucer , which would block out the magnetic field of th e earth. The master gyro was calibrated to true north prior to take off, and would continue to hold that position during flight, so that the \"slave\" compass w ould have that as a reference, in order to actuate the six-volt motor an d turn the geared compass heading ring to reflect the correc t direction of flight.

Low and High Frequency Electromagnetic Waves And Tesla's Wireless Tr ansmission of Energy Low frequency electromagnetic waves can pass through solid bodies, and tend to \"hug the earth\" , while high frequency waves don't penetrate solid bodies, causing a \"skin effect\" on them, and don't \"hug the earth\", but tend rather to travel outward away from the earth in straight lines. Ni kola Tesla, in his Colorado Springs Experiments, was the first person to investigate high volta ge waves of high and low frequency, and their terrestrial, atmospheric, and solid-body effect s. The scope of Tesla's Colorado Springs experiments were so far-reaching, that very little or nothing was sa id in science journals about them, because they left other scientists so dumbfounde d that they were paralyzed by miscomprehension. Many of Tesla's tests in Colorado were related to electropulsion. A long wave affects the internal ma ss of a space ship, \"synthesizing momentum\", by invoking the rotatory motion of elect romagnetism, to create the drill-like electromagne tic microhelices (\"tubes of force\") which \"bore through\" the ether as the mass moves. At the same time, a higher frequency at th e opposite end of the ship, opposite to the direction of travel, causes the ether to be accelerated as it passes through the mass of the ship and its contents, w ith an increased angle of pitch, so the microhelical boring action pr opels the ship through space. Low frequency waves also make it possible to project forceful longitudinal electromagnetic pulses to a specific, distant point, by sending the wave along a conductor or polarized atmos pheric \"carrier beam\" of U.V. or highe r frequency radiation. The high voltage long wave, carried directionally to a distan t point by the carri er beam, can in turn carry additional higher frequenc y waves superimposed on it, to deliver the high frequen cy exciting energy, at the powerful long-wave peaks. This was the basi s for Tesla's \"Transmission of Electrical Energy Without Wires\" inventi ons, as well as his \"e nergy beam\" and \"death ray\" inventions, as the same system can be us ed for all three. The manipulation of these wave characteri stics is inextri cably involved in electropulsion, stimulated by Tesla's study of the works of 19th century \"ether physicists\", and his own brilliant creative intuitions of the 24"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"rotating magnetic field, in Budapest Hungary, in 1882. This rotating magnetic field discovery was involved in his electropulsion discovery, because Tesla realized that the rotatory force of magnetic fields could be used to synthesize the rotating \"tubes of force\", the naturally occurring phenomena in solid bodies spoken of by Faraday and Maxwell and known to Tesla, to prope l a ship through space. The tubes had also been discussed in 1881, by J.J. Thoms on in England, but Thomson had never related the tubes specifically to the ether until after Nikola Tesla had connected the tubes to his intended electropulsion. Tesla discovered that by using a low frequency beam-directed pulse, he could cause, at the quarter wa velength, the erupti on of a large electromagnetic pulse which could, by carrying a much higher exciting wave, excite the atmospheric gases in a region, to explosively expand them, followed by a tremendous impl osion and the abso rption of a great amount of heat in the area, causing immediate freezing. This process would create an initial explosive sh ock wave followed by the implosive return wave, similar to nuclear detonation. For example, by using a low frequency of 60 cps, with a wavele ngth of 3,100 miles, directed by carrier-beam, a pulse could be made to erupt at one-quarter wavelength- —775 miles, corrected to 751 miles by ve locity factor. By superimposing an exciting frequency of say 50 mega hertz or so, the atmospheric gases could be excited to cause a \"cold implosion\" which absorbs heat. By altering the wavelength and the di rection of propag ation, the results could be delivered to any terrestrial point. The Tesla ion bulb, fundamental to Tesla's \"beams\", is a solid aluminum hemisphere, encl osed in a glass vacuum envelope, excited by high voltage D.C. applied to the ce nter of the hemispherical end. A polarized beam is emitted normal to the flat face center. The frequency is determined by the voltage. The ion beam polarizes, concentrates, and guides a spherical, long wave front, amplified by Tesla's \"extra coil\", to a distant target, which amplifies a higher freque ncy wave front superimposed upon it, whic h will \"ring\" in-the targ et area at one-quarter wavelength, in fact ring many times. Outside the bulb, in close proximity to the beam, the high voltage alternating current (\"power wave\") of low frequency, is emitted by a ring-shaped electrode, and is directed along the beam's atmospherically created conductive path, and is projected toward the distant target where the one-quarter wave peak delivers it at its \"point\" of greatest potential.

It should also be po inted out that th is method involved the absorption of energy \"from the e nvironment\", since heat moves from hot to cold. This was ye t another great energy di scovery. Tesla's method \"opened up\" the atmosphere to this possibility, consistent with what he said about nuclear energy coming from \"the environment\". The Tungushka explosion may also have been the impetus for a \"very tempting offer\" made to Tesla years before by V.I. Lenin, mentioned in retrospect in a Novemb er 29,1934 letter fro m Tesla to J.P. Morgan (microfilm, Library of Congress).

Laurence, New York Times, Sept. 22,1940,11, p. 7). These four \"new\" discoveries—a ll of which could work together—were actually a juxtaposition of and different appl ication of Tesla' s devices already tested separately in th e Colorado Springs experiments or later in New York or Wardenclyffe, w ith the exception that by 19 15, he had tested the electropulsive missile powered by b eam-projected electrical energy, and had tested a small, one-man elect ropulsive prototype in which he ventured out his hotel window at night over New York City in experimental test flights, and which served as an experimental basis for a much larger and more ambitious set of space ships which he had designed, which were re peatedly rejected by the U.S. government, probably because they thought he was nuts. Even the Nazis were sk eptical that the Tesla electro-propulsive technology might work, being unc onvinced until We rnher von Braun had actually tested the concepts at Los Alamos in 1936 and 1937, and obtained the final appr oval of Hitler. Almost immediately after von Braun's return to Germany in late 1937, construction was begun on large \"cigar-shaped\" ship s, using at first the ir on pressure hulls of U- boats, which were already equipped wi th a hermetically sealable system carrying diesel generators for use in the atmosphere, and batteries for use in outer space.

The fact that I was a personal frien d to an American rocket scientist named Peter van Dresser, who was angered by Dr. Robert Goddard's pre-war work with von Braun, and who was present in New Mexico since the '20's and was intimately fa miliar with the 1930' s liaisons to von Braun's secret Los Alamos activities, left little remainin g to be proven, since there is no longer any security basis for concealing such liaisons, if \"rocket research\" was the only thi ng von Braun's pre-war American presence involved.

The first edition was printed in Scotland, under the title A History of the Theories of the Ether and Electricity, front the age of Descartes to the close of the nineteenth century. The second edition incorporated \"n ew material\" related to quantum mechanics. Classical theo ry was in Vol. I, while Vols. II and III gave the origins of relativity and quantum theory up to 1926. Neither the 1910 first edition nor the 1951 revision men tioned Tesla, but the chronological sequence appeared to be \"skewered' in the revised edition, with little or no attempt to point out what the scie ntists were actually aiming at in terms of electropulsion. Though inform ation regarding Nikola Tesla was omitted, there is much va luable related information. In his preface, Whittaker stated th at where space is now considered \"emptiness\"—except fo r its property of propa gating electromagnetic waves—the development of quantum electrodynamics referred to a vacuum with a new status as the loca tion of 'zero point' oscillations of the electromagnetic fields and zero point fluctuations of electric charge and current, as well as a polarization conforming to that of a dielectric constant, which is non-unity (i.e., wh ich contains energy). This implies awareness of the ZPR, but quantum theory inherently excludes the possibility of \"zero-point\" fluctuatio ns, since all such waves are always regarded as possessing one-half \"quantum\". Whittaker said that an alleged failure by ether theory proponents to observe the earth's motion relati ve to the ether, caused the downfall of the theory, but the facts show that the rela tivists, backed by corporate publishing interests, hastily dug th e grave and threw the dirt over the 29"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"corpse of ether theory while it was still aliv e, for the wrong reasons. Much of the error wa s due to focusing on the weakest proponents who believed that a portion of the ether is \"carried along\" by the earth, and that an optical aberration would have to be observed at some point away from the earth, in order for an ether to exist. It was asserted that the failure of this observation was the \"death\" of \"the\" ether theory. By advertising ether theory 's weakest and most er roneous proponents and ideas, the media made the RQM's hasty funeral of ether theory easy, and paved the way for the gullible publ ic's acceptance of relativism. I concluded that Whittaker's 1951 edition intentionally skewered important facts concerning electropul sion, which I have attempted to straighten out for you in this book. I now feel more comfortable with my version of Tesla's theory, than I di d prior to reading Whittaker's book, but that was only because I knew wh at I was looking for. The facts I found are almost exactly as I said in my se cond edition of Space Aliens. By reorganizing Whittake r's material into mo re proper order, I discovered much \"new\" (\"old\") documentation, that 19th century scientists were in pursuit of elec tropropulsion, and that there were interesting similarities between the thinki ng of certain scie ntists of the era and my own, which could eliminate some erroneous concepts about what they actually said, and shows similarities to what I observed on numerous occasions in th e behavior of electropul sive \"flying saucers\", since the \"proof of the pudd ing\" is when it flies ac ross the dinner table. It was my intent to examine known th eory leading up to Tesla, to see what he contributed to their discoveries, and to determine what happened since that time to obscure, misinterpret and ultimately conceal it. To this end, I present for you a brief history and documentation of pertinent ether physics. J.J. Thomson's \"Electromagnetic Momentum\" Returning to the concept of the \"carry-along\" ether, Max Planck, originator of quantum mechanics, conscr ibed to this form of ether theory in part, saying that the ether had to be irrotational, carried along at the same velocity as earth near its surface, and compressible and subject to gravity like the atmosphere , in order for the theory to be true. At best, Planck's beliefs showed a weak mechanical conceptualization, something unexpected from one purpor tedly so adept at \"mechanics\". J.J. Thomson (1856-1942), discover er of the electron, conscribed to 30"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"a different and more plausible ethe r theory. Thomson had theorized— based on Maxwell's earlie r theory—that a charge d spherical conductor moving in a straight line must produc e displacement currents in the medium (Phil. Mag. xi [1881], p. 229). In 1893, twelve years later, he claimed to have discovered \"elect romagnetic momentum \", saying \"...in an electromagnetic field there is stor ed in every unit volume an amount of mechanical momentum, proporti onal to the vector product of the electric and magnetic vectors\". (J .J. Thomson, Recent Researches in Elect. And Mag. [1893], p. 13.) Thomson also was said to have developed the theory of moving tubes of forc e—which harked back to Faraday's earlier work—saying in 1891 that molecular structure is closely connected with tubes of electrostatic force, with magne tism regarded as a secondary force. He stat ed that \"...the aether itself is the vehicle of mechanical momentum, of amount (1/4*pi*C) [DB] per unit volume.\" (Phil. Mag. xxxi [1891], p. 149; Recent Researches in Elect. and Mag. [1893], chap. 1.) Tesla Shows Up It is interesting to note that these \"discoveries\" by Thomson however, although following his in itial speculations ba sed on Maxwell's theory, also followed Tesl a's lecture before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers at Columbia Colleg e, N.Y., on May 20, 1891, in which he described expe riments in which he ha d earlier pre-empted Thomson's work with experimental verification, together with a demonstration of techniques and ma chinery built by him which obtained frequencies and voltages which W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) had said earlier in England, were \"impossible to achieve\". In that sense, the \"good old boys\" in Britain shoul d have admitted that Tesla's work was prior, after having acquiesced in the admiss ion without rebutta l, that \"they\" were unable to create th e equipment to produce th e required frequencies to investigate and to experime ntally verify these phenomena. J.J. Thomson's theory, which linked electromagnetism with momentum in a mathematical and unified way, on pap er, somewhat repeated Tesla's earlier lecture of 1891, proven by his earlier experiments, but Tesla's theory wa s different from Thomson's, whose theory was incorrect. Thomson's el ectromagnetic mome ntum could be created instantaneously only with Tesla's contri vances, which existed before Thomson's \"discovery\", only in Tesla's laboratory , so there is no 31"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"way that Thomson could have reduced \"his\" theory to practice or experimentally verified it. Though the facts show that T homson was prior to Tesla in attempting to publish a valid theory, Tesl a could not publ ish prior to perfection of his invention, which wa s not a factor affecting Thomson. Tesla was first to prove his theory by experimental results. Tesla remained more th an a gentleman about it, de ferring often to Thomson, though Thomson even attempted late r to dishonestly claim Tesla's alternating current and high frequenc y discoveries. Thomson's earlier work (Phil. Mag. xi [1881], p. 229), concer ning a charged spherical conductor, moving in a straight lin e, had commanded Tesla's respect and probably influenced his work, but Tesla's 1884 discovery of the rotating magnetic field had already b eaten them all to the punch, and documentation shows that he ha d arguments with his \"learned professors\" in Graz, who said he must be \"crazy\", from his 1870's student days, to prove it. It must have worked a horrible hardship on Tesla, to remain silent about his complete theo ry, which he could not publish without giving away his technology, before he coul d perfect a working model to get patent protection. It was like the Wardenclyffe towe r, turning in the wind of incompleteness for lack of m oney, created by having been falsely induced into building an expensive system wh ich would exhaust his energy and financial resources to the poi nt of bankruptcy. In respect to momentum , I would analogize it as follows: When a body is held by a spinni ng or arcing arm, it cont ains the changing tubes of force created by angul ar momentum. When rele ased, it moves in a straight line vector, corre sponding to the state of th e tubes of force at the time of release. While held by the ar m, centrifugal force was created by the tendency of the tubes to move in a straight line, or at least to continue whatever transverse or co mplex pattern of movement of the tubes which then existed, which crea ted the resistance to change by the tubes at any moment. Once released , \"something\" (t he microhelical tubes of force, as they then existed) determined its direction of movement and velocity, which in a vacuum w ould be force-free. These facts are consistent with Tesla's (Thomson's , Faraday's, Maxwell's) \"tubes of force\", which I will explai n later in gr eater detail. Most of Thomson's 1881 work hark ed back to Maxwell, and before him, Faraday, who had stated in 1831 that movement of an electrostatically charge d body is equivalent to a current, which was 32"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"described as a tube of force cr eated by movement and momentum (Faraday, Experimental Res. Sec. 1644; Maxwell, Treatise , Secs. 768-70). In his consideration of the nature of \"ponderable matter\", Faraday had suggested th at an atom may be nothing more than a field of force— electric, magnetic and gr avitational—surrounding a point-centre, which is completely penetrable (Bence Jones' Life of Faraday , ii, p. 178). Fresnel later stated, 'Upon considering the aberration of the stars, I am disposed to believe that the luminiferous aether pervades the substance of all material bodi es with little or no resistance, as freely pe rhaps as the wind passes through a grove of trees'. Fresnel's concept presupposed that the ether surro unding the earth was unaffected by earth's motion, and generally agrees with what is actually observed, except for his failure to consider how the earth's dynamic electric field affects the ether. Along with his c.1831 theory of an (elastic) solid electric ether, and lines of magnetic force, Faraday considered all space as \"filled\". Wm. Thomson (A.K.A. Lord Kelvin ) (1824-1907), at age 17, based on Faraday's earlier announcements, introduced into mathematical science the idea of electric action at a distance by means of a continuous ether. In 1846, he analogized elec tric phenomena with mechanical elasticity. It was his early concept th at material atoms move through the ether 'without displacing it or compressing it' (letter, FitzGerald to Heaviside , 4 Feb. 1889), concepts later to be adopted by Tesla in saying that the ether 'behaves as a fluid to solid bodies, and as a solid to light and heat'. About 1853, Bernhard Riemann (1826 -66) conceived an ether which resisted compression and change s of orientation (Ann. D. Phvs. cxii [1867], p. 237; Riemann's Werke , 2e Aufl., p. 288; Phil. Ma2. xxxiv [1867], p. 368). Riemann thought the resistance to compression cause d gravitational and electrostatic effects, while the resistance to changes in orientation caused optical and magnetic phenomen a, but he failed to develop these concepts further. These early Ri emann insights were however very influential on later thinkers. He c onceived a stationary ether based on the generally accepted assumption that, as the earth moved through space, the ability of one to see a star with a steady image disproved a dynamic ether. As to the propagation of electric action through space, Riemann proposed a new equation in which voltage changes outward from charges with a velo city C, but he also fa iled to follow up with a proper consideration of the properties of the ether, because he died too 33"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"damned young. Riemann's insights were verified almost 50 years later, ten years longer than his entire lifetime. Years later, Maxwell, after reading Farada y's 1831 Experimental Researches in Electricity (3 Vols.), formed a me chanical conception of the electromagnetic field, connecting Faraday's magnetic lines of force and electrical ideas with the mathem atical analogies of Wm. Thomson, carrying Faraday's concepts a step fu rther (I have always liked to say that Maxwell \"put the math to Fa raday\", because Fa raday couldn't do much math, though he is recognized as the greatest \"experimental philosopher\" in history, a former Irish bookbinder's journeyman who got his early education from the books he was binding, and who at age 21 happened to write a letter to ch emistry professor Sir Humphrey Davy in 1812 and so impressed him that the following spring he was appointed a chair at the Royal Institution, and the rest is history). A sort of electrician's Mozart, Faraday like none other, was almo st always right from the beginning, in the middle, and lo ng after his death, with so many remarkable insigh ts and observations which were made without resort to tiresome pages of math, lucky for Maxwell, who made his own contributions in the process. Faraday had stated that induced magnetism in iron exists only within the iron, was zero in external free ether, and was the basis for electrical induction. Maxwell's \"elect ric displacement in a dielectric\" was analogous to the ma gnetic induction B, which he said may have a value different from zero ev en in the free ether . According to Maxwell, there is a displacement (i.e., an electric movement away from equilibrium position) wherever there is electric force, whether \"material bodies\" are present or not (thus carrying his elect ric displacement into the ether) (Maxwell, Scientific Papers i, p. 451; p. 526). It had occurred to me that sin ce the earth and bodies \"at rest\" on it are in uniform motion (or uniformly changing motion) in respect to a stationary ether, that th ere were differences in electric displacement of ether in the space within solid bodi es and space within the free ether, due to the polarizat ion of the ether by the elect ric field of the earth, and the differences in dielec tric constant between th e two. I deduced from this that the constant movement of bodies through a stationary ether- filled space, carrying their charges with them, creates the displacement currents. Maxwell had represented Faraday's lines of magnetic force (vectors of magnetic induction) as the velocity of an incompressible fluid, based 34"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"on Faraday's sugges tion years earlier that th ere may be a \"dynamical condition\" similar to elec tric current, and that the 'physical lines of magnetic force are currents' of this \"f luid\". This agrees with Faraday's \"dynamical condition\" of the electric field 'carried along ' by the earth, equivalent to a current, producin g the earth's magnetic field and gravitation, by effects on the stati onary ether within earth's dynamic electric field. It also implies that magnetic line s of force are the \"equal and opposite\" reaction to electrical current as Faraday stated, and vice- versa, though magnetic fields are more the secondary effect of electric currents. The magnetic field is equally important however, in its creation of the rotatory motion imparted to electricity, which is responsible for the microhelical \"tubes of force\" which create the momentum which maintains the perpet ual motion of celestial bodi es in the universe, and guides electric currents through the ether foreve r. And this sounds very much like it must have been Tesla's theory as well. Cosmic Motion and Local Momentum The earth orbits the sun at a pproximately 18.5 miles per second (66,600 mph). The solar system is or biting the center of the Milky Way much faster, and the Milky Way or bits the Magellanic Clouds much faster, and so fourth. This hierarchy of velocity increases from the moon, to the earth, the Milky Wa y, etc., although these pale into insignificance relative to electro magnetic velocity, since move ment of force is time- relative. In all, the ear th's velocity and polarity relative to the ether continually varies according to its ro tation, orbital position, and galactic cycle. When between th e sun and the Milky Way' s center, for example, it moves slower than when to the \" outside\". As the earth rotates each day, its polarity of movement thro ugh the ether rotates 15.2 degrees per hour, with a rotational surface velocity at the equator of approximately 1,041 mph. This continuous change in polarity is so gradual that it is sensually imperceptible, but proba bly contributes to modulating the gravity force (and may even in fluence our emo tional states!). According to W.B. Morton (Phil. Mag. xli [1896], p. 488), an increase in charge of a body increases its \"virtual mass\", which increases the work required to move it by amount 2e 2 /3ac 2 . This was in correction of J.J. Thomson's figur e. Such a case suggest s a dynamo consisting of large, insulated conductive balls on the end of a shaft, which are alternately charge d and discharged to altern ately increase and decrease 35"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"their masses, thus rotating the shaft. But this poss ibility appear s to be a fantasy, since the \"increase in wo rk required to move the ball\" (in Thomson's theory) is related to an increase in the resistance to the penetration by the ether, caused by th e presence of the extra charges, which according to Faraday created a \"Faraday cage\" effect which shuts out the magnetic lines of force. Wi thout the magnetic lines of force—or with suppressed or diminished lines of force—the rotation of the tubes of force by the ma gnetic field are diminished or stopped, resulting in a diminution or eliminati on of momentum. Such pr opositions give ample food for thought. If Tesla had continued to increase the earth's charge with his gadgetry, he could have thrown the earth's timi ng off, slowed it down, and possibly caused it to drift toward th e sun. Being aware of these facts, he later addressed them and even listed them as future technical possibilities, which also corroborated his developm ents in the field of electropulsion, in case anybody noticed. Local Momentum and Celestial Movement It's an odd thing, momentum. If a body is in motion relative to earth, its momentum is in the direction of moti on, yet as a body at rest on a spot on earth, it still had momentum along the spot's ultimate motion relative to the ether. The motion is co mpound, but the ultimate momentum of a body is truly a vector which represents all the forces acting upon it. The earth rotates at ove r 1,041 mph at the equato r, so there is that momentum, but the earth 's orbital speed a nd path around the sun means that the earth's more general path is in the direction of its orbit. As the earth's rotating su rface would appear to a distant observer to be moving backwards from its direction of orbital motion over a period of a day, it is always m oving toward its orbital pa th because its orbital speed (over 66,600 mph) is greater than its rotationa l speed. All the rotation does is periodically diminish and increase the speed of our \"spot\" on the earth's surface, and grad ually rotate its orientation once every 24 hours, as it moves through space. With its compound movement and momentum—of the earth, the sola r system, the Milky Way, etc.—we have a more complex pattern of m ovement, and since a body which is in constant, compound, gradual, ever-cha nging motion relative to the ether, some interesting effects are bound to be found. These e ffects are not, as 36"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"described by Newton's laws, due to an attractive force acting at a distance, through an empty space. Due to the relatively gradual or biting and rotating changes in respect to the earth 's motion relative to the et her-field, a relatively small amount of \"externally acting\" force (\"gravity) would have to be ever- present in order for Newton's la ws to apply even on the purely descriptive level, except for the local ether phenomenon I will specify in further detail, which insures \"f orce-free\" perpetual motion, despite the gravitational effects. While I agree with that part of Einstein's theory that says gravity is not due to the direct action of one object to another, I disagree with the part that says it is due to th e idea that a body \"wraps\" space around itself and \"curve s it\". Without an ether, there is nothing to curve, and with it, there is no Relativity theory. In early 1995 , in exchange for a copy of Space Aliens, I received a copy of Eric Lerner's The Big Bang Ne ver Happened, and was pleased to find there are some in the academic world of physics (or astrophysics), who share at least in part, my own views on the Big Bang Theory, although they don't go so far as I do in saying the theory was created and promoted by the coercive en ergy monopolists, because of its apparent intent to negate the free energy available from the ether, due to what I call the \"Law of Conservati on of Perpetual Motion\". I also find Lerner's book refreshing, not to ment ion useful in charting some of my ideas on a more cosmic scale. Lerner's unsung hero is Hannes Alfven, a Norwegian astrophysicist and cosmographer, whose earlier \"acad emic burial\" by the Relativists was somewhat reversed in 1970 by a Nobel Prize awarded to him for his development of magneto-hydrodynamic s and his concept of frozen lines of magnetic force, a theo ry later repudiated in pa rt by Alfven himself. Alfven had in a way replaced the word \"ether\" with \"plasma\", and strongly disagreed with the Relativist 's misuse of math ematical theory, which he said 'must always be the servant of physical understanding and close observation, rather than its master'. He claimed giant currents through space, from the su n through the planets, along magneti c lines of force, actually transfer angular momentum to the planets. This discovery, together with his work on cosmic MHD events, places Alfven's work very close to Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity. The appearance of such books as Le rner's is a positive development, which represent dissent which seems in tolerable to the Relativists. The Big Bang Theory is in decline am ong scientists, despite all the NASA 37"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"false propaganda in the press and ma ss media attempti ng to perpetuate and support it. I recommend Lerner's book, even though he has not yet evoked an affirmative support fo r ether theory, but has dared to challenge Relativism and the Big Bang cosmology. The actual course that a particular spot on earth takes through the universe is naturally more complex than that of the sun, sinc e the earth represents a smaller cycle within the larger. Relati ve to the ether-field, the entire interrelated movements of the solar system and Milky Way takes our spot in a gene rally wavy path, along whic h our velocity relative to the ether periodically ac celerates and decelerates. The same principles of momentum which apply to the cosmos must also apply to the motion of immedi ately local bodies, except that the effects are skewered by the presence of earth's pe sky electric, magnetic, and so-called \"gravity\" fields. What Alfven had touch upon in his long- unrecognized discovery of giant electric and magnetic currents through space, are similar to unrecognized forces operati ve on a local scale as well. As our planet hur ls through space at 70,000 mph, and us with it, there are things happening on a supe r-microscopic scale of utmost importance, which play all-importa nt parts in this giant panorama. The big question—the on e which those who invented the Big Bang cosmography sought prematurely to put to re st—is how can everything stay in perpetual motion under the Re lativist theory, without violating the law of conservation of energy ...and thereby also refuting the Relativist theory? The still-born theori es of Tesla were still knawing at their throats, along with those of Alfven, so they wanted to obscure all truly competing theories, and enshri ne themselves in the annals of science for all time. Their method was to fabricate a scenario in which one original giant explosion was the 'o rigin' from which all we see is but an effect which will eventually \"run down\", like a car which is out of gas. The missing ideas are ho w universal processes are continually self- replenished. Through an interplay of natural stro ng and weak forces and matter, perpetual motion is conserved. Strong fo rces overcome weaker forces. Cosmic radiation travels thr ough the ether, until it reacts with plasma, forming matter . When matter concen trates, its forces concentrate. In contact with other, less concentrated matter, stronger, cosmic forces within the space it occupies are unl eashed, producing transmutations and eventually more cosmic radiation, which travels through space until absorbed and conv erted by plasma or other mass, into more mass or radiation of lower frequency, and the process 38"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"continues, ad infinitum. The rigid thinker must have a simp listic answer as to \"where matter comes from\", \"where it is going\", \"what is the pu rpose of life\", or \"what keeps everything going\", etc. Sometim es we must accept reality, and discard phony theories whic h attempt to give us a simplistic answer for what we either must ad mit that we just don't know, or should consider some questions too stupid to ask. The facts conc erning the existence of universal matter, forces, vast distances, massive bodies and events, and perpetual motion, are irreducible prim aries or \"first la ws\" about reality, which we must accept befo re we can progress with answering particular questions related to the more useful aspects of existence. Since the orbital speed of earth ar ound the sun is greater than the speed of earth's rotation, our spot never moves \"backward\" relative to the ether. Since the orbital speed of the Milky Way is greater than the orbital speed of the solar system or ro tational speed of the earth, our spot continues in a generall y \"wavy-wavy\" path in which we accelerate and decelerate over a one-day short cycle, while the entire earth moves in a wavy path over a 365-day longer cycl e, and so fourth. There are still larger and larger cycles of motion over time, in which the solar system orbits the Milky Way, the Milky Way orbits th e Magellanic Clouds, and so on. As can be seen from these cyclical moveme nt, the universe is an unlimited system of interrelated sy stems which move in gear-like precision, rather than in an explosive pattern ala the Big Bang. Universal movement is in an orderly, cyclical pattern of circles (or ellipses), within circles, representing mechanical osc illations which are related to smaller and larger electromagnet ic ones. The exceptions to this—the occasional cosmic explosion, such as that of a supernova—are the exceptions which prove rather than disprove the rule . Even the occasi onal comet follows a cyclical pattern, while the debris from cosmic events eventually falls into patterns. Though such explosions on our sc ale are gigantic, they are like minor ripples in a pond on a cosmic scale, and should not be allowed to warp our perspective. If last week a remote controlled telescope—such as the Hubbell— showed a movement which when comp ared to an earlier measurement of a few years ago indicat ed a movement away from a distant part of the universe, just remember that this is only an observation of movement which is part of a much larger pattern of oscillat ion over a much longer period of time, in whic h the movement will later appear to be going the other way, from our point of view, if we could make an observation 39"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"millions of years or longer into th e future. Because of the circuitous pattern of movement which we obser ve in relation to earth at the present, and the larger structures in \"our vicinity\" of the universe, we have good reason to believe that all such movements are cyclical, and to extrapolate ourselves in to the time when the appearance would be quite different. The theory that the earth and other celestial bodies are the result of the Big Bang are ludicrous. The universe has no age, as it has always existed, and al ways will exist. The whole theory about how planets \"were created\" is erroneous. Life forms would not only have to have existed at one time on Mars, but on all other planets and stars, at some time. In fact , the planets grew from smaller bodies as a result of lif e forms, which c onvert interstellar radiation into solid mass. There is no depth to which we can drill on earth, or otherwise produce direct ev idence to the contrary, where we will not find matter which was in its past part of living things. This theory of course makes the planet \"too old\" fo r the Big Bangers, as it would take a much longer time to reach its present state, and would throw their \"calendar\"—on which th e high priests of \"Big Bangery\" have placed the earth's \"birth date\"—off. For example, one of the components of chlorop hyll is iron. This iron along with carbon deposits and ot her elements results from photosynthesis. If strata of the earth, thousands of feet, even miles thick, are composed of the d ecayed and metamorphosed remains of plant and animal life, the original biomass represents a conversion ultimately of radiation through photosynthesis, and into the many elements and minerals composing the st rata, which can be easily traced to this process, such as iron, calcium, phosphorus, su lfur, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and helium. Such elements accumulate through the cosmically- driven forces of life forms. There is probably a constant of universal mathematical proportionality between life forms and inorganic ones. The ether, the medium which conduc ts the ZPR, can be converted into any form of matter or energy. It is possible to precipitate any element out of the ether, using proper technology. The ether contains the building blocks of what we call \"solid matter \", the proof of which enhances this possibility. Nikola Tesla eventually realized th e ether's use in his discovery of the \"tremendous propelling force\". Hi s electropulsive technology works, and that is more important that splitting hairs...or atoms. Only an ether which is intimately involved with momentum, could 40"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"explain such a tremendous propulsi on force such as that which I observed in 1953. This propulsive fo rce was nothing more than a force which exists in nature, which in the hands of man becomes an article of will, once the physical processes capable of synthesizing and manipulating it become known. From the rate and manner of acce leration, in conjunction with the probable mass of the ship I observed, it was imme diately apparent that the entire volume of the ship , if filled with conventi onal rocket or jet fuel, would have been consumed in the three seconds required for it to accelerate to c.9,000 mph and disa ppear at infinity, except for the existence of Tesla's technology wh ich electromagne tically canceled inertia and synthesized a ne w momentum instantaneously. What is inertia? Inertia is the momentum which a body 'at rest' already possesses because it is in a st ate of uniform moti on, but which to us appears to be at rest. Tesla' s technology uses the electromagnetic interaction, which is 10 40 times stronger than gravity, to create a \"tremendous propelling force\" whic h instantaneously reprograms the atoms and molecules of a ship with new micro helical tubes of force along a new trajectory, and destroys the \" memory\" of the tubes of force which created its prior inertia/momentum. Electropulsion is a \"fr ee energy\" proces s in which ener gy existing in the environment—\"gravity\" and momentum—are overcome by and replaced with the naturally stronge r force of electromagnetism, to perform a greater amount of wo rk during a given time, which theoretically is 10 40 times more work, using a smaller amount of \"input energy\" to trigger the change. If \"ene rgy\" is \"the ability to do work\", and \"work\" is the \"movement of ma ss through a distance\", then a stronger force will do more work over a given tim e period. A change of form of energy from a weaker to a st ronger force (which exists in the environment) will use \"e nvironmental energy\" to do more work in a new way. The process which makes electropu lsion possible, is the dynamism of the universe, which naturally exchanges weak er and stronger forces to conserve perpetual motion, with any lost momentum being resupplied by the ZPR. "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III: OBSERVATIONS With Tesla's theory and the back ground of older research and theories held temporarily in abeyance, let's look at what has been directly observed either by myself of by those closely associated with me. What I began observing in 1946, a nd have continued ever since, are man-made electro-propuls ive flying machines wh ich can hove r, turn on a dime at high speed without flyi ng apart, and accelerate almost instantaneously to at l east 9,000 mph, without readily audible sound or sonic boom. The ship I ob served in 1953, in broa d daylight, hovering at about 300 feet distance, about 250 feet above ground level, precessed at a high angle—about 45 degrees—and a lo w rate of about two precessions per second. Soon after I sp otted it, it began to move away directly due west, quickly accelerating to about 800 mph, at which time it did two absolutely square turns—a right a ngle turn straight down and another right angle turn back to level fli ght—then accelerated to a point of infinity above the horizon in three seconds. Th e ship was constructed as if it were two 50-foot diameter st ainless steel woks joined together clamshell fashion. It ha d concentric \"striations\" —grooves in its surface which appeared to be a bout one inch wide all over its surface—which gave its bottom half the appearance of a giant \"spun-metal\" wok, as it precessed with the sun's rays playi ng on its bright me tallic surface. The sun was about ten degrees a bove the horizon at the time. As it precessed, it gave off a sparkling, \"rainbow-colored\" electrical corona, like a metallic surface whic h was being electr ified with high voltage Tesla currents. On the shadow side of the bo ttom away from the sun, as the ship precessed, there appeared a soft, 'cloudy', infra-red glow, which indicated the possible presence of microwaves, while the general \"rainbow\" corona was apparen tly of high voltage electricity. As the ship began accelerating, the rai nbow corona formed a sparkling, scintillating trail behind th e ship, which also showed a \"texture\" of lines in the trail which app eared to indicate the fre quency of the pulses. Since the lines appeared to be \"abo ut\" five feet apar t at \"about\" 200 mph, the frequency could have been 60 cycles per second—a frequency which is very low, with the approx. 5-foot-spaced pul ses coming at the quarter wavelength. Th is rough guess is based on what \"200 m.p.h.\" looked like from our vant age point. (Note: In Te sla's time, \"microwaves\" were those of only a few fe et or inches, such as t hose he measured coming from the earth during his 1899 Colo rado Springs Experiments. The 42"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"\"internal\" frequency possi bly used with this sh ip—the penetrating long waves, oriented along the direction of acceleration, to polarize the \"tubes of force\" necessary fo r the propulsive force to act on the ether—were apparent from the outside, as the pulsing effect graphically illustrated by five-foot spaces left in the scintillating ion trail. Consistent with the observed be havior, the electro-propulsive system appeared to instantly synthe size in an internal atomic way, inertia and momentum, things wh ich normally create problems in acceleration and turning, but which the system overcame as shown by the evidence of the square, right angl e turns. The syst em appeared to have very little to do w ith \"gravity\", even thoug h it also reve aled that gravity is apparently due to the same kinds of electromagnetic mechanisms. These observations were ta ken at face value, as proof of certain facts concerning the nature of the ether, gravity, inertia, momentum, and \"electropulsion\". I had observed whole sq uadrons of saucers at night, between 1947- 53, during which time I slept outdoors in our back yard. The squadrons arrived over our town from the directi on of New Mexico (about ten miles from the southern New Mexico bord er), and departed back in that direction after their night-time mane uvers. (Note: The ship involved in the 1953 sighting flew due east, toward the northe rn tip of Ft. Bliss, near El Paso, Texas. Ft. Bliss was the lo cation of Headquarters, U.S. Army Ordinance, where Wenihe r von Braun was appointed research director in the summer of 1945. The ordina nce headquarters was subsequently moved, along with von Braun's main base of operation, to Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, about 1951.) The night squadron saucers turned in angles of 30 degrees or multiples (30, 60, 90,120, 180, etc. degrees). That meant they had the same navigation and control system as the 1943-vintage German saucers which my Peiltochterkompass was used on. My observations, together with a ll the written information on the Peiltochterkompass, and an analysis of the device itself, revealed quite a lot about the German \"Kreisel Te ller- p2\" and its propulsion system: 1. The ships were electr ically propelled; 2. The propulsion system created an electric field around the saucers which necessitated the deve lopment of an in ertial guidance system and compass, since a magnetic compass would be useless due to the \"Faraday cage\" effect; 3. The ships were circular, discus-s haped craft, which turned in 43"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"twelve peripheral directions of the compass, plus \"up\" and \"down\"; 4. The ships used a horizontally oriented master gyro-compass (\"Meisterkreiselkompass\"), calibrated pr ior to take-off to true north, as the frame of referen ce with which to naviga te the ship using an electromagnetic slave co mpass, which was interconnected to stepping switches which also actuated the ship 's bi-polar propulsion electrodes; 5. the system canceled the normal ef fects of gravity, inertia, and momentum, and instantly synthesized momentum in the chosen direction, without disturbing the operation of the master gyro, which continued to maintain it s heading during flights, apparently because of an 'internal' inertia/momentum within the ship's outer shell; 6. the instant turns showed an incompressible ether which is integrally locked with mass in the phenomena of inertia, momentum, and gravity. Since the 1953 daylight sighti ng, I have seen many other electropulsive craft, but one of th e best sightings I made was on a moonlit night while soaking in a hot tub. Rub-a-Dub-Dub. Seven Folks in a Hot Tub On a Wednesday evening, Januar y 24, 1996, at approximately 7:00 PM, I sat in a hot tub with seven other people, at the Ten Thousand Waves Japanese Bath House, located on the western slopes of the Sangre de Christos Mountains, in the Hyde Park vicinity above Santa Fe, New Mexi co. As I steamed in the tub, conversation between a couple from Denver and myself drifted from the dangers of fluoride to \"W hat do you do?\", to which I answered, \"I write some\". Asked what I had written, I answered \"A book called Space Aliens from the Pentagon.\" A beautiful woman on my right exclaime d \"I have your book. I'm a friend of Alex and Rex. I love your book so much, and so do they.\" I thanked her and we ex changed introductions, and then I said, \"I see saucers up here al most every time I'm here after dark...and as a matter of fact, th ere's one right there\" (pointing out a flashing aircraft flying slow ly easterly about 15 degrees to the lower left of the crescent moon, at a dist ance of about 10,000 feet from us). A heckler across the tub said \"Aww, that's a plane\", to 44"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"which I responded, \"T here's another one...and if they're planes, why have they parked? The flas hing lights mask an underlying glow. The eye recoils from a flash, and neve r has time to recover before another flash. When they move faster, they glow brighter, which is why they are going so slowly.\" No sooner had I spoken, than th e stationary ship on the left quit flashing, and turned into a dark, glowing green shape like a football field surrounded by a tr ack. Around the \"track\" was a dark strip, with a purple cor ona outside that , produced by the Tesla coils. I could see the curvature of its bottom as it moved, flying in a large circle , as I followed it with my Outstretched arm and index finger, and my fellow ho t-tubbers oggled in jaw-dropped amazement. The following is a black-a nd-white photo of a painting I did of the saucer, as s een from the bottom: It returned to its starting poin t, skidded to a halt, and began flashing again. This t ook approximately ten s econds. Since the ship appeared about one-half to three- quarters of an inch at arm's length (about 2 feet), at the 10,000-foot distance, it was around 400 feet long and 250 feet wide. Since the diameter of the circle from 45"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"top to bottom was about 30 degr ees, its speed wa s about 2,000 miles per hour (the speed didn't surprise me, since I clocked the one I saw in 1953 over our back yard at minimum of 9,000 mph when it departed). I almost miss ed it, because I didn't have my glasses, and because it a ppeared to have been \"stealth-ized\"—designed to be c oncealed by the night sky, by controlling its emissions to be a da rk green and purple, so as to more closely match the light value and blend into the night sky. The main 'give-away' was the color differences. Others in the tub—most of whom didn't need glasses—saw it more sharply than I, yet wouldn't have seen it at all if I had not pointed it out to them. I pr obably would not have seen it myself, had I not been observing the flashing ships beforehand, with the moon so close above, cr eating some back-lighting which helped to define the darker silhou ette when it developed. Moreover, the real reason I saw it, was my own preconscious mental self-conditioning. I was amazed at its large size, since, when flashing, it appeared much smaller. When I finally looked back to the other side of the tub, the heckler was gone, the on-cue saucer demo being apparently too much for him. If the saucer crew had been listening to my words, their perfo rmance couldn't have been more perfectly timed. Bravo! Do they al so have some computer software that reads lips? It is my theory that the government jerks have chosen that particular location to do some \"testing\", because of the titillating avai lability of the nu merous private hot tubs open to the night sky, occupied by priv ate nude couples of all sexual persuasions, ready to be video taped by them. I can just see them trading the tapes among themse lves, another good reason to \"...keep the secret\", to avoid prosecution. It was the first time I had se en the green-glowing type reported years ago by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of the planet Pluto. It was the seco nd most graphic demonstration of saucer technology I have witnesse d. If I had not spotted it, none of us would have seen anything extraordinary, excluding the beautiful lady next to me who liked my book, and was a strong competition to the sau cers. Incidentally, th e female breast shape may be \"natures most nearly-pe rfect shape for a flying saucer design\". Hmmm...maybe the \"cigar-s haped\" ships were dreamed up 46"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"by a woman. The \"green-glowing\" ty pe was apparently the result of research designed to make the sh ips less visible in the night sky, since the early models—such as the \"foo-fighters\" (\"Fliegende Schildkrote\" [\"Flying Turtle\"] a nd \"Kugelblitz\" [\"Ba ll Lightning\"]) glowed brightly. The oblong desi gn (as distinguished from the circular or 'peripheral' saucers) comports with what I call the \"linear type\" in my book . According to a friend who is an expert spectrographer, the green corona indicated atomic absorption, which I presume to be 'stealth' technology used to suppress the white light spectrum. He seemed to think sodium based coating, while I think maybe chromium, b ecause it appeared to be a veridian (\"chrome\") green. The so ft, 'cloudy' green also indicated positive corona, as distinguished fro m the 'hairy' negative (purple) corona around the outer periphery. Comparison to Other Siehtings The hot tub sighting was not a cl ear, \"daylight\", \"close-range\" sighting, like the first good sighti ng which I had personally made on a bright, late summer afternoon in West Texas, in 1953, within 300 feet, right over our back yard, in Kermit, Texas, as our family and friends were having an ice cream pa rty. I had been the last in my family and neighborhood to see a saucer in a close-up daylight sighting, since three had appeared on two consecutive days, June 1st and 2nd 1950, while I was unfortunately in the Davis Mountains about 120 miles to the west. My father has seen more of them than I, and was once held in his car for 15-30 minutes, on the night of Nov. 2, 1957, just south of Levelland, Texas, by one of the 200-foot-long, egg-shaped chingas, which had scared the livin' daylights out of him. The th ing hovered within ten feet of his car top, killed his engine, and burned out all his lights, yet failed to burn out a single fuse in any of the car's circuits. The saucer's electric field was so str ong that it arrest ed current flow, and was strong enough to cancel the magnetic fields in the generator and circuits. The white-h ot tungsten filaments were the weakest points in the circuits, and the saucer's pulse currents apparently subjected them to ma gnetic and electric shear forces which broke them apart. My father had to drive back to Levelland in the dark, spend the 47"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"night in a motel, then drive home to Odessa, Texas at dawn's first light. He arrived home about 7:00 AM, had a quick br eakfast, and left for Sewell Ford to have his lights fixed, saying nothing a bout the saucer. I turned on the TV for the morning news as he left, and realized that he had been one of the several drivers held by the ship (or ships) that night. I drove to Sewell Ford, and questione d him about it as the mechanic fixed the lights. He asked how I knew about it, and I told him it was on the news. He said he didn't want to be called \"crazy\". This was what I call \"anti-paranoia\". It was reasonabl e to fear ridicule created by government propaganda. Later, in 1963, I had the opport unity to discuss the matter more fully with the sheriff of Hockley County, while working in Brownfield, Texas, as a graphic ar tist, doing advertising art for a manufacturing and publishing oper ation which had contact with the soil conservation district with which the sheriff was affiliated. The ship seen by my father matc hed in shape, appearance, and performance, the type observed by deputy Lonnie Zamora, near Soccorro, New Mexico. Zamora had at first described the crew of the ships as typical G.Ls in grey -green Air Force jump suits, but later altered his story, saying they were \"...about the size of children\". This was after the security spooks 'leaned' on him. Saucers can be seen almost any ni ght in the area where I live, and are very profuse in an even more obvious way around the Cheyenne Mountain area to the sout h of Colorado Springs, where the underground NORAD complex is located. With the several direct observations, or reports from those in my family or fro m my close friends as \"proof of the pudding\" kept firmly in mind, let's see what more can be found in ether theory history to reflect on them. The Ether and \"Ponderable Matter\" In 1879, James Clerk Ma xwell (1831-1879) said that the velocity of the solar system relative to the ether could be determined by observing the retardation of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. The observed behavior—in which the light of a star can be viewed with a steady image as the earth moves thr ough space—indicates a sta tionary ether relative to a moving earth, solar system, and ot her bodies. The ether is ultrafine, yet very dense, and composed of pos itive and negative electric matter, which pervades all so-cal led \"free space\", as well as the space \"occupied\" 48"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"by \"mass\"—which the old ether physic ists called \"ponderable matter\"-— because it is mostly \"space\". Since the ether is stationary, it is the ponderable bodies' which move through it, just as Fresnel said, rather than vice-versa. The ether is transparent, because of its ultra fine, high frequency structure, which does not refract or re flect visible light, because its ultra- fine size is too tiny to react to such low frequency radiation. To momentively \"access\" the ether in a pr opulsive way, high voltage pulses are required. This is in accord w ith J.J. Thomson's \"electromagnetic momentum\" theory, and was confirme d by the tests conducted by Nikola Tesla by 1891 (later detailed in hi s 1891 lecture before the A.I.E.E., Columbia College, N.Y.). Tesla's te sts confirmed a reaction which was more than the feeble ionic reac tion of light gases such as the misinformational 1950's \"patents\" of T. To wnsend Brown later attempted to induce the gullible publ ic to believe was the correct technology. After his tests, Tesla stat ed that the ether became a 'solid state' medium to \"light and heat\" (v isible and infrared light), and could be accessed by subjecting it to \"suffici ently high voltage and frequency\". The ether becomes more apparent when there is a sudden change in the direction of motion, rate of acceleration, or velocity of a body. The movement of a charged body, equiva lent to a current , creates a new degree of electrical displacement of the ether through which it moves, and influences the resist ance to changes in veloci ty through the affected ether by the protons and electrons composing the body itself. The increased work required to move the sphere—caused by an increased \"resistance\" called \"ine rtia\", must be reflected by the increase in its tendency to remain in motion which is ca lled \"momentum\", which demonstrates a rearrangement of the manner of movement of or displacement of th e positive and negative ch arges which correspond to the motion. Therefore, once in moti on at a constant velocity, though a charged body requires more conventional work to se t it in that motion, its momentum would be increased by the increased charges, consistent with an increase of its \"virtual mass\". It is clear that both inertia and momentum are caused by the same thing, which is a persistence by the configuration of reaction patterns in the atomic and electric structure of mass to maintain their present states. Ju st as changing magnetic fields or electric fields are required for inductance, the creation of such changing fields by changing moti on are the basis for inertia and momentum. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"All bodies are in motion, and within all bodies , protons and electrons are also in mo tion, because \"elasticit y\" and vibratory motion occurs in \"ponderable ma tter\" and in the ether. Th e ether sets up certain patterns of motion in the electrons and pr otons (and atoms and molecules) in ponderable ma tter passing through it. As the earth passes through the ether, its rapidly varying electrostatic forces reach out for so me distance and polarize the negative electrical components of the ether, and affects bodi es within its reach, creating what we call \"gravity\". The stationary ether, appearing to move through an earth-bound body, due to the earth's motion through it, undergoes a change in electrical displacement , due to the difference in dielectric constant between the space outside the body and th e space within the body. The electrical displacement in the ether ou tside the body prio r to entry, and the electrical displace ment as it enters a nd passes through the body, changes due to the change in dielectric constant, and affects the \"electric content\" (protons and electrons, electric charges and fields, and magnetic fields) within the body. These changes in turn cause the changes in electric displacement of the ether—a downward thrust on the body's atoms, away from the pre-existing \"equilibrium position\", which the atoms would occupy in the absen ce of gravity—just as Maxwell said. The \"equilibrium position\" for the el ectrical particles of ponderable matter vary according to the dielectr ic constant. A cha nge in dielectric constant results in a change in the equilibrium position, through an electric displacement, which eventua lly may result in a new equilibrium position. The time-relativ e aspect of gravity is due to the inertia of a falling body at any stage of its fall, which forces the gr adual increase in pitch of its micr o helical tubules. In summary, inside an earth-boun d body at rest relative to the earth, there is a difference in polari zation and displacement effects, from those which exist outside the body in free space. Since earth's electric field is graduated through the interm ediate space, betw een the negative at earth's surface, and the positive at the ionosphere, the dielectric properties are subjected to graduated strains. The effects of electrical displacement and gravity vary accord ingly, somewhat like Newton's \"inverse square\" law. It is here that a difference between the \"force of gravity\" and the effects of inerti a and momentum become apparent. Traditionally, inertia has always been considered (according to Newton's First Law of Motion) the tendency of a body \"at rest\" or in 50"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"\"constant velocity\" relative to the eart h, to continue its state of rest or constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. Since all bodies at rest relative to the earth are al ready moving at the same \"constant velocity\" of the earth however, only changes in movement relative to the earth are at issue, and any such changes affect the patterns of flow within mass of the tubes of force, as it moves through the ether, at any given time. Since only a body which m oves in respect to the earth has been traditionally said to have \"momentum\" (\"the product of a body's mass and velocity\"), this rule is wr ong, since all bodies \"at rest\" relative to earth already have \"momen tum\" as well as \"inertia\". Momentum and inertia are due to the exact same \"tendency\", which relates ultimately to a frame of reference to the universal ether, but for convenience—since we don't ha ve an absolute \"f ix\" on the ether yet—we use the moving earth as a frame of reference from which to measure a body's rate of change relative to the ether, as the earth maintains its relatively constant velo city. There is a special case on earth, because the ether within the reach of earth's electric field has been \"conditioned\"—that is, its dielectric cons tant has been subjected to electric strain. This comports with Tesla's statemen ts concerning the effects of \"rapidly varying electros tatic forces\" eman ating from earth. The earth has momentum within the sun's frame of reference, just as a moving car has momentum within the earth's frame of reference. Some physicists have mist akenly applied a \"field of influence' idea, thinking this \"field of gravitation al influence\" somehow isolates a body from references outside this field. I believe that earth's \"gravitational field\" is a product of its moving electric field (a \"current\") as it influences the ether within it, and that the so-called \"gravity field\" extends no further than earth's electric field. Momentum is due to the setting up inside a body, of micro helical tubular vibrations of atomic structures , composed of electrical particles— -electrons and protons—as the body pa sses through the u ltra fine ether. The micro helical rotation of thes e tubules are the product of the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization identified by Faraday. Any variance from earth's uniform motion re sults in a resist ance to change in micro helical pitch, since the rotating tubes of force spin around so much of the irrotational ether core s (\"Onmi\") over a given period of time, and a change in motion requ ires them to ro tate around a commensurately greate r or lesser quantity of Omni, depending on whether the change is an acceleration or de celeration. The tubules 51"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"possess electromagnetic force which is locked into the discrete flow pattern between the Omni and the tu bules, which are coupled to the 'ponderable matter' structure which is the recipient of the momentum. It is probable that the linkage between matter a nd the ether is effected by a current—perceived as \"electric charge\"— which passes through the matter constantly at a rate which is commensurate to the relative velocity difference. Though the flow patterns of the mi crohelical tubules are always gradually changing—because of the co ntinual reorientation of the earth as it moves in its \"uniformly com pound\" changing ways, these changes are sensually imperceptible because they are gradual over time, with effects which are virtually constant. Though the changes are too slow to sense, the action of the tides is probably related to them. The natural gravity force is alwa ys normally toward the earth, which is negatively charge d, within earth's electri c/gravity field, due to the polarity of that field, since th e negative component of the ether in free space is electrically displ aced upward by the repulsion of like charges, while the inertial characte ristics of the more massive positive component is forced and attracted dow nward, and is mo re resistant to changes in displacement. As the ether enters a body at rest on earth, its displacement changes because of the ch ange in dielectric constant, just as Maxwell said. As the dielectric constant of the body changes, the electric displacement of the ether within the entr ained atomic structure of the body changes, creating a downw ard force as each of the negative electrical components of the et her move downward, creating an increased attractive for ce on protons above, and an increased repulsive force on electrons below. The moving ether particles create the gravity force, similar to how an inverted aerodynamic airfoil creates a down-force on an airplane. Due to the greater velocity of the electromagnetic interaction at C however, this down-force is irre spective to the direction of earth's movement relative to the ether, since the interaction between the electrical components of matter and the ether at C, is due to the conditioning of the ether by earth's electric field, which is vertically polarized, and creates the same proximate effect on mass over time, irrespective as to earth's orientation relative to the et her. Though the velocity of earth relative to the ether is thousands of miles per hour, it is not fast enough to \"outrun\" the electromagnetic interaction. "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Orbiting Planets and Satellites The concept that a satellite in orbit around earth is \"held\" in orbit by \"earth's field of grav ity\", seems false. The l ogical implication of my analysis is that th e orbital path take n by a body is beca use it \"sees\" that path as one of least resistance, as if it were a straight and level path. Since for a given radius above earth the ethe r is displaced to a certain degree, an orbiting body would experience an accelerating force which would be met by inertia, if it were to move upward, and a decelerating force which would be met by momentum, if it were to move downward, so its path in force-free constant velocity remains at a constant radius or level of etheric displacement, as the path of least resistance. Since the determinative factor which limits a body's motion is the reactance of its internal electrical co ntent with the ether at its particular degree of displacement by earth's el ectric field, at a given altitude, an orbiting body \"sees\" its orbital path al ong a path of like displacement, as a straight and level path, even though it is a straight and orbiting path. This path is rather concentric to the earth at a certain altitude. This is similar to ho w Einstein said that space and time are \"wrapped\" around a large spinning body as it move s through space, except Einstein believed in no ether, without which \"empty space\" would have nothing to \"wrap\". One of the revealing facts obviate d by films of astronauts floating in the so-called \"gravity-free\" space of an orbiting space station, is the contradictory assertion that the spac e station is \"held\" in orbit by earth's gravity. If the earth's gravity exerted sufficient force to hold the station in orbit, the internal envir onment would not be \"gravity free\", but would pull the astronau ts down to the floor, in stead of allowing them to float all around inside, as we've seen so many times on TV. Yet, there is sufficient elasticity within the internal masses of the astronauts' bodies, between electrical content a nd the ether, to allow movement in that manner. Maxwell said this elastic ity resides in the magnetic fields. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV: HISTORICAL DE VELOPMENT OF THE THEORY Rotatory Motion and the \"Screw Effect\" Wm. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) fi rst asserted that magnetism possesses a \"rotatory\" ch aracter related to heat or the thermal motions of a body (Proc. R.S. viii [1856], p. 150). Ni kola Tesla made many references to Wm. Thomson, pointing to his work as a prelude to his own discoveries and applicat ions which especially intensified in 1892. A review of the work of the world's major minds leading up to Tesla's breakthrough is neces sary to show ju st what Tesla discovered and what it meant in re spect to ether physics and physics in general. Around 1870, Thomson had conduct ed experiments which seemed to indicate that \"gravitational acti on\" could be induced by spheroidal bodies oscillated by electri cal currents or mechani cal pulses (F. Guthrie Phil. Mag. xli [1871], p. 405). The su rface pulsations could cause attractions or repulsions in respect to other bodies, as verified by Thomson. Tesla was aware of Thomso n's work during his student days in Graz, Austria, be ginning 1875, when he wa s 19. Thomson's work undoubtedly served as the spark of inspiration for Tesla in his early conception of an \"ideal flying mach ine\" which would be propelled by electricity acting upon the ether. This explains Tesla's continual references to Thomson, such as demonstratin g during his 1892 London lecture, a 'luminous wi re' sign powered by a Te sla coil, which said \"WILLIAM THOMSON\". At first, Thomson found that pond eromotive forces act between two solid bodies immersed in an incompressible fluid, when one of the bodies is immobilized and made to oscillate with a force which acts along a line between its center and th at of a much larger s phere which is free. The free sphere was attracted to the sm aller (immobilized) sphere, if its density was greater than the fluid, wh ile a sphere of less density than the fluid was repelled or attr acted, according to the ra tio of its distance to the vibrator in relation to a certain quantity (Phil. Mag, xli [1871], p. 405; Letter , Thomson to F. Guthrie, p. 427.) Thomson's experiments were analogi cal ones, for which he had evoked praise from his contemporaries even when he was still a teenager, although his refusal to believe anyone 's assertions unless he could build an analogical model to pr ove them often led to th e consternation of those of his contemporaries, such as Maxwell, who relied often on 54"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"mathematical equations. The sphere experiments were designed to use mechanical and electrical wave met hods to construct a model to probe the gravitational, inertial and moment ive reactions of so lid bodies in the ether. The Faraday effect—the rotation of the plane of polarization of radiation in a dielectric medium (such as the atmosphere, space, and certain solid materials) in a magnetic field—stated that the angle of rotation of radiation is proportional to the magnetic field strength and the length of the path in the me dium in the field. These early experimenters knew there was a conn ection between the rotatory motion and momentum, and sought to find it. The rotatory (versus the linear) character of magnetic phenomena was strengthened by Thomson's experi mentally verified conclusions on the magnetic rotation of light. Th is rotatory character not only influenced Tesla's discovery of the ro tating magnetic field, but is also fundamental to inertia and momentum , as I will later explain, since movement of a charged body consti tutes a current which creates a magnetic field which creates the rota tory motion which \"bores\" through the ether like a drill to create momentum. Thomson's system was later investig ated by C.A. Bjerknes between 1877 and 1910. Bjerknes showed that when two spheres immersed in an incompressible fluid were pulsated, they exerted a mutual attraction which obeyed Newton's i nverse square law if th e pulsations were in phase, while if th e phases differed by a half wave, the spheres repelled. At one quarter wave difference, ther e was no action. Where pulses were non-instantaneous at distances gr eater than a quarter wavelength, attractions and repulsions we re reversed (Repertorium d. Mathematik I [Leipzig, 1877], p. 268 ; Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. iii [1879], p. 276; iv [1880], p. 29). The publishings of thes e researches and experiments in the physical journals of Europe were available to Nikola Te sla, during his student days at the Polytechnic In stitute in Graz, Austria, and at the University of Prague, in Czechoslovakia. Tesla could read and unde rstand all these pertinent journals in their original languages. Around 1878, George Francis Fitz Gerald (1851-1901 ) (Phil Trans. clxxi [1880], p. 691; FitzGera ld's Scientific Writings , p. 45) compared magnetic force and velocity in a qu asi-elastic solid, based on a model devised earlier by Ja mes MacCullagh (1809-47) (Brit. Assoc. Rep. , [1835]), whose model wa s the only one which c ould propagate waves 55"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"with the properties of light—obviously anal ogous to the el ectromagnetic theory of light —as shown by MacCullagh's et her equation of motion and ether theory which made it feasible to extend et her concepts to represent optical phenomena, along with magne tic and electric interaction. An Electrostatic Charge Carried Around In 1879, Edwin H. Hall (Amer. Jour. Math, ii [1879], p. 287) a student in Baltimore, repeated an experiment suggested by H. A. Rowland, his professor, whose orig inal experiment with a gold-foil- covered ebonite disk in a magnetic field showed that electric charges on a disk were carried around with it as it was rotated (Ann, d. Phys, clviii [1876], p. 487). In Hall's experiment, a gold leaf strip in which a current was flowing, was placed into a magnetic gap. This produced an electromotive force at right angles to the magnetic field and the current, which was proportional to the product of the two. Called the \"Hall Effect\", it was already inherent in th e three previous effects discovered much earlier by Faraday. Faraday had discovered induction, by forcing a conductor through a magnetic field, cutting the lines of magnetic force and producing a current in the conductor. The second of Faraday's triad was production of a magnetic field in an unmagnetiz ed iron core, by forcing a current- carrying conductor through a gap between the poles of a core. Faraday's third effect was the generation of a current. Though Hall's effect was inherent in the fact that it was the reverse of the force required by Faraday to push the conductor through a magnetic field. Hall's work completed the triad of effects, by bringing it into consciousness. This effect is the basis for MHD (Magneto-Hydrodynamic) generators, and electropropulsion, through the special means which wo uld finally be brought into fruition by the work of Tesla. Since the galvanometer needle in Hall's experiment was deflected only when the magnetic field arose or collapsed, the physical thrust created was a vector product which had already been expressly suggested in Ma xwell's Treatise (1862), almost 15 ye ars earlier (derived from Maxwell's analysis relative to Faraday's work of c. 1845), though Maxwell failed to follow up with ex periment (because he died), the equations are still used. Though it was said by Whittaker that the Hall effect, like the magnetic rotation of light, occurs only in ponderable bodies and not in 56"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"the \"free ether\", this statement was patently false, since the effect actually depends on the conductivity of a medium. This was a definite lie on Whittaker's part, probably \"required\" under the 1951 revision. The fact that the effect occurs in \"ponderable bodies\" and \"conductive media\" however, is all-important fo r electropropulsion, since it shows the reaction between such bodies and media and the underlying \"etheric framework\" which is accessed in the process. Since the \"natural media\" (the ether and the atmosphere) so often referred to by Tesla in his patents become conductive under the influence of electromagnetic radiati on of sufficiently high voltage and frequency, the effects in the free ether, dependent upon proper conditions, can affect the ether with in a ponderable body, so as to move the body through the free ether. The most startling proof that the Hall effect works in the free ether, was Tesla's \"transmission\" of electrical energy through space by high frequenc y oscillations, as detailed in his 1892 Lecture before the Institute of Electrical Engineers, London. Since an electric field 'displaces' the ether—which is the basis for MHD pumping (especially wh en pulsed)—the effect actually showed an operable \"electromotive force\" (\"emf\"), or \"electro-propulsive force\", between ponderable bodies and the ether, by means of electromagnetic action. The high voltage and high frequency are required by the ether's great density and ultra-fineness. The moment Tesla had succeeded in transmitting electrical energy by means of high voltage, high frequency currents—\"radio waves\"—the ether was \"accessed\". Tesla's work at that point had alre ady verified experimentally everything that Maxwell had mathematically analyzed as being the electromagnetic nature of light. Though it was strongly im plied, the literature av ailable to me failed to explicitly state the idea that in ertia and momentum are the products of an electromagnetic rotatory force which acts within bodies, upon a dense, incompressible ether which permeates all bodies and all space. Neither was it specified that a pulsati ng sphere or othe r ponderable body can be electrically propelled through the ether, without the presence of another sphere or other ponderable body to pull against—except in the statements of Nikola Tesla and his \"flivver\"/\"model T\" electropulsive \"ideal electric flying machine\". In 1884, the year Tesla discovered the rotating magnetic field, J.J. Thomson attempted to determine the field produced by a moving electrified sphere, and the mathem atical development of Maxwell's 57"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"theory accelerated. It was naturally easier to solve such problems from the known behaviors of simple geom etric forms—planes, spheres, and cylinders (J.J. Thomson, Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. xv [1884], p. 197). The possibility that the ether was composed of stationary positive charges carrying their own 'sub-electronic' negati ve charges which were elastic, and could be displaced, had apparently evaded the thinking of Thomson. Although he had assumed that displacement currents must occur in the ether, he had earlier thought this was due to the magnetic effects of moving charges, though he failed to show how the displacement currents occurred, or what their effects were in terms of inertia and momentum. There was already a sort of battle brewing between the proponents of classical electrodynamics, and th e proponents led by Maxwell of an electromagnetic theory of light. To the former, conductivity occurred in metal wires, etc., while with Maxwell, it occurred in the surrounding dielectrics and ether-filled space, with the conductors serving only to \"guide\" the action. Tesla appeared to fit more into the Faraday/Maxwell camp. FitzGerald had unified the tw o views by arguing validly that Maxwell's unification was valid because radiation could be generated by purely electrical means. Along this line, Thomson (1884) fi rst considered a charged sphere moving uniformly in a straight line. He assumed that the electric charges were uniformly distributed, with an electric field the same in all directions, no matter what position the sphere was in, the same as if it were at rest. This assumption proved tr ue so long as the velocity of the sphere and the velocity of light were neglected. In 1889, Wm. Thomson (P roc. Roy. Irish Acad. i [30 Nov. 1889], p. 340), stated, \"Rotational vortex-cores must be discarded; and we must have nothing but irrotational revolution and vacuous cores.\" By this, Thomson meant that the vacuous \"eth er\", inside rotating tubes of electromagnetism, did not rotate, pres umably because of its density, but also because, if the cores rotated along with the rotating tubes of electromagnetic force, it would neutra lize the electro-mechanical action by which momentum is created. FitzGerald found a purported error in Thomson's work, saying that the required \"circuital condition\" wa s not satisfied unl ess the moving charges on the sphere were considered as current, combined with the displacement and convection currents due to the motion. In correcting Thomson's error, FitzGe rald went overboard in concluding that the 58"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"magnetic force due to the displacement currents of the moving sphere, had no resultant effect. In this conclusion, FitzGerald seemed to have forgotten the \"Faraday cage\" and \"magneto-optical\" effects, since a moving charged sphere would constitu te a current by his own admission, and all currents create magnetic fi elds, which cause the rotation of electromagnetic radiation and light in the surrounding ether as a resultant effect. In 1888, Oliver Heaviside showed that the electrostatic and electromagnetic units \"v anished\" inside the sphere. This was the opposite to Faraday's experiment in which electrostatic charges placed inside a stationary, clos ed vessel, \"appeared\" on the outside. Apparently, movement of the sphere—which in creases its moment um—appeared to Heaviside to force the charges back inside. Heaviside's conception of the \"spherical\" symmetry of charges dur ing movement was disproved by G.C.F. Searle in 1896 (Phil. Trans, clxxxvii [1896], p. 675). Searle found that a moving \"point charge\" system is not a sphere, but an oblate spheroid, with a polar axis alo ng its direction of mo tion. What Whittaker failed to point out, was the importance of this finding, a connection between inertia, momentum, current, surface charges \"vanishing\" and \"reappearing\", and an electromagne tic polarity along the direction of momentum, as well as an electro-mech anical link to th e ether, since the displacement of the el ectric lines and polar ity correspond to the movement, consistent to my thinking that the tubules create momentum inside a moving body. The \"vanishing\" electrostatic/electromagnetic units are 'occupied' internally by th e microhelices, in perpetuating the movement of the body through the ether. During this time, Nikola Tesla ha d not tarried. He had already shown that the \"circuitou s condition\" could be me t in a totally new way. In his lecture before the A.I.E.E. at Columbia College, N.Y., May 20, 1891, he demonstrated his years-ol d technology, and stated that he connected \"one terminal\" to a lamp and the other to \"an insulated body of the required size. In all cases the insulated body serves to give off the energy into the surro unding space, and is equivalent to a return wire.\" In this lecture, Tesla also demons trated \"electromagnetic momentum\" which J.J. Thomson was accredited with discovering in 1893 (J.J. Thomson, Recent Researches in Elect. And Mag. , [1893],p. 13). In the same year as Searle's finding (1896), W.B. Morton (Phil. Mag, xli |1896], p. 488) similarly show ed that the surf ace density of a charged body is unaltered by moti on, but the lines of force no longer 59"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"leave the surface perpendi cularly. He also found that the energy of the surrounding field is greater when in motion than when at rest. Since greater work is required to create a given velocity for a charged sphere, than for an uncharged on e, and since the sphere can even move in a way which lessens the work, a connecti on between moving charges and an ether was verified. This was considered true because the charges increased the \"virtual mass\" of the sphere, a nd the self-induction of convection currents is formed when the charges are set in motion by movement of the sphere, but neither of these e xplanations seemed to explicitly note that a force between a moving charged mass and the space through which it moves must have an ether framework to push or pull against, or that a curre nt is caused to flow be tween matter and the ether due to the movement. J. Larmor (Phil. Trans, clxxxvi [1895], p. 697) suggested that the inertia of ponderable matter may be ultimately proven to be of this nature, since atoms were constituted of system s of electrons. The only objection to this was an inconsistenc y with the alleged \"indivisibility\" of the electron. This \"ind ivisibility\" I believe is due to a deceptive \"apparent effect\", produ ced by measuring inst ruments which measure only \"whole\" electrons, be cause they use only \"w hole protons\", rather than ether particles. An \"undivided electron\" is the \"equal and opposite\" response to a \"whole\" positive charge . This is similar to Werner Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\", in that exact meas urement of less than a whole electron is made impossible by the instruments of measurement. If a greater \"virtual mass\" effect (W.B. Morton, supra ) is created electrically, which increa ses or decreases the ease of movement of a body through the \"free ether\", and increa ses the total energy of the moving system, then a link between ponde rable bodies a nd the etheric framework was proven, and the mean s for creating the imbalance of forces necessary for elect ro-propulsion—the use of moving charges in a specific way to synthesi ze the currents of a movi ng system—was just a matter of time and mo ney for Nikola Tesla. There were implications in the works of Faraday, Maxwell, Wm. Thomson, J.J. Thomson, MacCullagh , Morton, Searle, Heaviside, Hall, and FitzGerald, of a distinct rela tionship between mo mentum and the movement of charges connected to mass, through an interpenetrating gaseous, dynamic, neutral, ultra-fi ne ether existing in all space and ponderable matter, upon which elec tromagnetic ponderomotive forces 60"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"act. Once the equilibr ium of the ether and ZP R was \"disturbed\" by the moving system, the 'displacement' c ould be rectified only by an equal and opposite reaction, wh ich was a flow of curr ent between the moving system and the ether. Th omson had accepted the pr inciple that the ether itself is the vehicle of mechanical momentum. Th e Hall effect had shown that an electromotive thru st is produced along a thir d axis as a result of a current and magnetic fi eld at right angles, and though it was alleged that this thrust could not be prod uced \"in the free ether\", but only in ponderable matter, th e works of Heaviside, Se arle, and Mort on showed that the moving charges could either increase or decrease the normal ease of movement of a body, provi ng the feasibility for electro- propulsion. Since electrical proce sses are reversible, Tesla's method consisted of using Hall's MHD method to cau se a flow of current between a 'stationary' system (relative to ear th) and the ether—as if it were a \"dynamic\" system—since it mimicked the currents of a moving system, and created a disturbance in the et her which could onl y be rectified by movement of the system. Once th e current commenced to flow, the magnetic fields thus created, impart ed the rotatory force which created the micro helical tubes of force which 'drilled' their way around the irrotational ether cores, and synthe sized the momentum which propelled the system through the ether. Nikola Tesla's statement (L ecture before the Institute of Immigrant Welfare , May 12,1938), that he had his Dynamic Theory of Gravity \"all worked out\" by 1893, and some 'a vailable' documentation of Tesla's work of 1891 or earlier shows that he was already ahead of the European field led by J.J. Thomson, Sear le, Morton, and Larmor, whose statements dated from the later 1890's. As for his 1915 progress, Tesl a stated in a Dec. 8,1915 New York Times article that his electro-propulsive \"...manless airship...\" would travel \"...300 miles a second...\" (1 .08 million mph), \"...without propelling engine or wings, sent by electricity to any desired point on the globe...\". The Sept. 22, 1940 New York Times article by Wm. L. Laurence completed the documentation, by statin g that Tesla had already tested his four-part Teleforce system, which included \"...a new method for producing a tremendous el ectrical propelling force...\", as used on his electrical aircraft. "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CHAPTER V: TESLA AND THE GOOD OLD BOYS' CLUB When Tesla popped into the pict ure, the British \"Good Old Boy's Club\" had been debating ether theory for quite some time, and the upstart Tesla must have hurt the pr ide of their linemen, by making an end run to make a touchdown. In 1847, W. Thomson, in discussi ng the motion of a magnetizable body in a non-uniform field of force, said a charged body attracts a body having a greater specific inductive ca pacity than that of the surrounding medium, and repels a body with a lo wer specific induc tive capacitance, to afford the path of best c onductance to the lines of force. Thomson had also stated that an electrode immersed in a fluid insulating medium (an experimental analogy to a body in ether-filled space), at \"...sufficiently high freq uency\", would cause a gravitation of gases all around toward th e electrode, but that th e general opinion (of he and his European colleagues) was that it was \"out of the question\" that such frequencies could be reached. This last opinion was soon to be disproved by a close follower and admirer of Thomson's work. In reiteration, another Thomson—J.J. Thomson—had claimed to have mathematically developed the theory of moving tubes of force (Phil. Mag, xxxi [1891], p. 149). For his Recent Researches in Electricity and Magnetism (1893, p. 13), his hypothesis was the \"t he aether is a storehouse of mechanical momentum\", but was this correct? Isn't it more likely that the \"storehouse\" of \"mechanical momentum\" is in \"ponderable matter\" which reacts with the ether? Nikola Tesla's lecture before the A. I.E.E. at Columbia College in 1891 was based on earlier experiment s. He mentioned the \"tubes of force\" and disclosed some of his discoveries concerning ether and momentum. His Feb., 1892 lecture before the Institute of Electrical Engineers, London, at a time when the Good Old Boys were still debating whether an electromagnetic ac tion could occur in the free ether, Tesla explained he planned to run motors at a distance by wireless energy, with equipment he had already built, and to extract free energy from the environment. Four years later, Wm. Thomson stated his \"inclination\" to \"speculate\" that \"altera tions of electrostatic force due to rapidly changing electrification\" are propa gated by \"condensational waves in the luminiferous aether\" (Bottomley, Nature liii [1896], p. 268). This seemed to indicate that Thomson was just beginning to take Tesla 62"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"seriously. In his 1892 London lecture for the Good Old Boys, Tesla had stated that the 'required' frequencies— wh ich Thomson had said were \"out of the question\" to be produced—were \"...much lower than one is apt to estimate at first\", and continued (in pertinent part, emphasis mine): \"We may cause the molecules of the ga s to collide by the use of alternate electric impulses of high frequency, an d so we may imitate the process of a flame; and from experiments with high frequencies which we are now able to obtain, I thin k the result is producib le with impulses which are transmissible through a conductor.\" \"...it appeared to me of great interest to demonstrate the rigidity of a gaseous column\"...\"with such low frequencies as, say 10,000 per second which I was ab le to obtain without difficulty from a specially co nstructed alternator.\" \"...how must a gaseous medium behave under the in fluence of enormous electrostatic stresses which may be active in th e interstellar spa ce, and which may alternate with inconceivable rapidity?\" In this respect, Tesla seemed also to address the omnidirectional ZPR. His statements also show he was attempting to make up his mind as to the characteristics of the ether, such as whether it is rigid or fluidic, and under what circumstances it may change, and its static or dynamic nature, of high or low density, and so fourth: \"What determines the rigidity of a body? It must be the speed and amount of moving matter. In a gas the speed may be considerable, but the density is exceedingly small, in a liquid the speed would be likely to be small, though the density may be considerable; and in both cases, the inertia resistance asserts itself. A body might move with more or less fr eedom through the vibrating mass, but as a whole it wouid be rigid.\" This statement reflects Tesla's prio r tests, since, prior to his 1892 lectures in London, he had perfor med tests between two electrified plates, stating that the \"space\" be tween became \"solid state\" when subjected to \"sufficientl y high voltages and freque ncies\". This addressed the issue of how \"solid bodies\" can pass through a dense, vibrating, interpenetrating mass of ether which, as a whole is rigid. This is the essence of how the \"inertia resistance\" of the underlying 'ether framework' can be summoned up by an electrified body which activates the ether with currents of \"sufficien tly high voltage and frequency\". As the inertial resistance of the ether \"a sserts itself, the electrified body is propelled through the ether by MHD thrust, which is really the \"microhelical drills\" at work. "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The \"specially constructed altern ator\" of which Tesla spoke was a 32-inch diameter one, which if simila r to the type used on the saucer I saw in 1953, was probably driven by on e of Tesla's bladel ess turbines. In the 1890's, Tesia said the alternator had produced up to 10 amps and 30 kilocycles. One of these al ternators is shown below: The saucer I saw in 1953 exhibite d precessional characteristics which could have been caused by th e use of such an alternator, the output and rpms of which under th e circumstances could have been varied with the power level of the sa ucer, as if it were being turned progressively faster by a turbine as the ship used more power to accelerate. The high angle and low fr equency of the precessions would be consistent with the use of a high frequency, large di ameter alternator, which was turned more slowly at hovering powe r, and increased in rpm for more power as the ship accelerated. Since the alternator would likely ha ve been attached ridigly to the airframe of the saucer, it could have caused the en tire saucer to precess at hovering power, while the downward acceleratio n due to gravity was being balanced by the upward electr opulsive acceleration, as the ship hovered in place above the earth. This phenomenon showed that the precession I observed in 1953 was e ither due to rotating internal machinery, or to the \"virtual\" angular momentum created by the electropulsive effects. The balanced forces holding the sh ip in mid-air would have been equivalent to holding it on \"gimbals of air\", so that it precessed freely "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"according to the speed of the rotating alternator's angular momentum and mass. This would have required very little force, because the electropulsive forces reduced the ships inertia to almost zero. On the other hand, the rotatory force wh ich a magnetic field imparts to electrical current, to create the microhelices, could be the cause of precession, as an \"equal and opposite reaction\", by collective rotatory precessive action imparted to all the atoms of th e entire mass of the ship. Tesla worked out the pr oblem of how to counte ract the tendency of the ship to rotate due to the torque of the alternator or turbine, by using two turbines or alternators, turned on parallel axes in the same direction or counter-rotated, as stated in his patent #1,655,114, Apparatus for Aerial Transportation, Jan. 3, 1928. In fact, a si ngle alternator and turbine turning on separate , parallel axes, linked by a gear box, would accomplish the same thing. As the ship accelerated to full speed and power, its low precessional rate and high precession al angle became a mere high-frequency wobble, as the ship shot to infinity in three seconds (which I estimated roughly 7.5 miles). This was consistent with the alternator being turned at a progressively higher speed. The rapid precessive wobble of the ship's periphery tended to blur its outline, something which has made it more difficult to obtain sharp definition s of the profiles of saucers in photographs and video. Coupled with this physical vibr ation may be the \"Faraday effect\" - the \"m agneto-optical effect\" wh ich tends to blur the outlines of objects subjected to intense electromagnetic fields. The extension of the ship's electric field also extends its ma gnetic field, and causes a rotation of the optical plane, so in addition to visual effects of the high frequency precessional oscill ations, the optical plane is actually rotated to create the weird magneto-o ptical effects so often reported, and becomes distorted in the mi nds of the mystics, who think it is some sort of \"time travel\" or \"interdimensiona l travel\" effect, a \"space-warpage\" or \"wrapping around\" of \"time and space\" by a \"rotating body\" as it moves through space, ala Einstein, except saucers don't \"revolve\", as proven by my Peiltochterkompass, and Einstein was full of baloney. The flying saucer may be powere d by a Tesla alternator, a Tesla coil, or a combination of the two. Te sla stated that the required currents could be conveyed by conductor, whic h allows for the instantaneous control of a ship by m eans of high voltage stepping switches or relays. Since an on-board power generator is usually required anyway, the use of an alternator is more convenient than a spark gap, coil, and condenser 65"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"combination, since the necessary high frequency alternations can be easily stepped up to higher voltages by several closely linked \"extra\" coils, placed about the ship. It is possible that a ball-shaped cockpit was used on some of the German Kreisel Tellers (\"Gyrating Saucers\") of the 1940's. The ball- shaped cockpit would have been pressurized, mounted on gimbals, and gyro-stabilized with a horizontally oriented Meisterkreiselkompass (\"Master-gyro-compass\"), which would not only gyro-stabilize the cockpit while the outer saucer precessed wildly, but would prov ide the polar compass heading for the slave compass: As the outer ship pre cessed because the alte rnator was bolted to the outer airframe—the inner cockpit would be gyro-stabilized, so the pilot and crew could have visibility of the outer environment. Even with a precessional angle of 45 degrees , the pilot would still be able to see where he was, and where he was going.

The 1938 lecture was less than five years before his death. More complete statements concerni ng these discoveries can only he gleaned from scattered and sparse sources, because the papers of Tesla are concealed in government vaults for \"national security\" reasons. When I specifically asked for these papers at the \"National Security Research Center\"—now the \"Robert J. Oppenheimer Research Center\"- —in 1979,1 was denied access because they were classified, even though on that same day I discovered the pl ans for the hydrogen bomb on an open shelf, and told a Ha rvard graduate student about it later in the day at a Santa Fe restaurant. The guy went to Los Alamos, copied the plans, and wrote an expose at Harvard. In his 1938 lecture, Tesla said he was progressing with the work, and hoped to give the theory to the world \"very soon\", so it was clearly his intent to \"give it to the world\", as soon as he had completed his secret developments. The \"two great discoveries\" to which Tesla referred, were: 1. The Dynamic Theory of Gravity - which assumed afield of force which accounts for the motions of bodies in space; assumption of this field of force dispen ses with the concept of space curvature (ala Einstein); the ether has an indispensable function in the phenomena (of universal gravity, inertia, momentum, and movement of heavenly bodies, as well as all atomic and molecular matter); and, 2. Environmental Energy - the Discovery of a new physical Truth: there is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment. The usual Tesla birthday an nouncement—on his 79th birthday (1935)—Tesla made a brief reference to the theory saying it applies to molecules and atoms as well as to the largest heavenly bodies, and to \"...all matter in the universe in any phase of its existence from its very formation to its ulti mate disintegration\". 67"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Those imbued with rela tivist theory often refe r to \"pure energy\" in some \"form\", but there is no such thing, since \"e nergy\" is an abstract \"ability\" which is always in the futu re.

Things are what they are irrespective as to whether we know it or not. Check your premises.\" If the term \"ene rgy\" is only a convenient abstraction, then it does not exist in physical form, and really describes the potential to perform work as a by- product of matter and electromagnetic radiation in perpet ual motion, some of the force of which has been diverted through a path where it pe rforms the desired work, as it goes on its merry way through the univ erse. Every change of form of either matter or radiation i nvolves the \"work\" which induces the change, or the \"work\" which is induced by the change. Without work there is no change, but all work is ultimately the produ ct of the universe in perpetual, self-sustaining moti on, as a rule a nd not an exception. As for Tesla's theory, we have hint s, such as, that the earth is the \"star of human birth\". In poetic expr essions, he hid sc ientific meanings in statements such as, that using the \"thunderbolt of Jove\" (the Indo- European sky god), man \"a nnihilates time and space\" , an allusion to the use of electro-propulsion (\"thunderbolts \"), to travel so fast, that time and space are \"annihilated\". Where the government has stolen his papers, we must search for mean ing elsewhere. In an article, Man's Greatest Achievement 1 . Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity in poetic form (as paraphrased by me): ► That the luminiferous ether fills all space ► That the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force ► That the ether is thrown into \"infinitesimal whirls\" (\"micro helices\") at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter ► That when the force subsid es and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of \"atomic decay\") John J.

Some of Telsa's unusual conceptu alization of the ether had been nonetheless expounded piecemeal, in his preceding 1890's lectures. 2 He later railed against the limited and err oneous theories of Maxwell, Hertz, Lorentz, and Einstein.

Its prop erties varied according to relative movement, the presen ce of mass, and the electric and magnetic environment.

Tesla commenced to complete his Dynamic Theory of Gravity at the same approximate period of time th at his experimental results and theories had been revealed in the three lectures, often illustrated with demonstrations using Tesla-invented equipment, as revealed in the following eight excerpts, in pertinent part (emphasis mine): 1. \"The most probable medium filling the space is one consisting of independent carriers immersed in an insulating fluid\". 2. \"In his experiments he dwells fi rst on some phenomena produced by electrostatic force, which he consider s in the light of modern theories to be the most important force in nature for us to investigate. \" 3. \"He illustrates how mechanical motions are produced by a varying electrostatic force acting through a gaseous medium.\" 4. \"One of the most interesting results arrived at in pursuing these experiments, is the demonstration of the fact that a gaseous medium upon which vibration is impressed by rapid ch anges of electrosta tic potential, is rigid \" 5. \"If through this medium enorm ous electrostatic stresses are assumed to act, which vary rapidly in intensity, it would allow the motion of a body through it, yet it would be rigid and elastic, although the fluid itself might be devoid of these properties\". 6. \"...on the assumption th at the independent carriers are of any configuration such that the fluid resi stance to motion in one direction is greater than in another, a stress of that nature would cause the carriers to arrange themselves in groups, since they would turn to each other their sides of the greatest electrical density, in which position the fluid resistance to approach would be smaller than to receding. \" 7. \"If in a medium of the above ch aracteristics a brush would be formed by a steady potential, an ex change of the carriers would go on continuously, and there would be le ss carriers per un it volume in the brush than in the space at some di stance from the electrode, this corresponding to rarefaction\". 8. \"If the potentials were rapidly changing, the result would be very different; the higher the frequency of the pulses, the slow er would be the exchange of carriers; finally, th e motion of translation through measurable space would cease and, with a sufficiently high frequency and intensity of the stress, the ca rriers would be drawn towards the electrode, and compression would result.\" 70"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The eight above ex cerpts are further reducibl e to the following four statements pertinent to electro-propulsi on technology: 1. Mechanical motions can be produced by varying electrostatic force acting through a gaseous (eth er) medium, which thereby becomes rigidified, yet allows solid bodies to pass through. 2. Under influence of st ress in one direction (under the polarizing influence of light or heat), the carriers may group together, forming tubes of force, creating greater ease of moveme nt in that direction. 3. When a (D.C.) brush is created by a steady potential, a continuous exchange of carriers is created corresponding to ether rarefaction, as the tubes of fo rce are drawn into the conductor. 4. With a sufficiently high freque ncy and stress intensity in the opposite direction, carrier exchange is blocked by ethe r compression, forcing the tubes of force to dissol ve in the conducto rs of the ship, imparting electromagnetic momentum . The system, using the two kinds of potentials (D.C. and A. C.), is known as \"p2\". The steady potential of the brush creates the required exchange of carriers, 'ratifying' (stretching) the elastic, rigidified medium (composed of the carriers immersed in the insula ting fluid) in a dvance of the ship, as the high frequency A.C. to the rear compresses them, blocking exchange from the rear, dissolving the tubes of force (my \"microhelices\"), creating instant momentum, normal to the surface (which is at right angles to the electric and magnetic fields). In 1884, John Henry Poynting's theo rem had been th at the flux of energy at any place is re presented by the vector product of the electric and magnetic forces , multiplied by C/4* PI . 3 This implied that forces in a conductor could be transformed there into other forms.

J. J. Thomson 6 had extensively developed the theory of the moving tubes of force, both magnetic and elect ric, saying that the magnetic effect was a secondary one crea ted by the movement of electric tubes, and assumed: ► that tubes exist everywhe re in space, either in closed circuits or terminating on atoms; ► that electric force becomes percei vable only when electric tubes have greater tendency to lie in one direction; ► that in a steady magne tic field, positive a nd negative tubes may move in opposite directio ns with equal velocity; ► that a beam of light is a group of electric tubes moving at C at right angles to thei r length (providing a good explanation for polarization of the plane of rotation). Tesla said his \"dirigible torpedo\" would fly at a maximum 300 miles per second, perhaps sin ce its forward velocity would be some maximum fraction of C. Thomson's later pub lishings on this subject followed Tesla's 1891 lectures before the Roya l Society in London, and appear to shed light on Tesla's work, stating: ► that a ponderomotive force is exerted on a conductor carrying electric current, consisting of a transfer of mechanical momentum from the agent whic h exerts the forc e to the body which 5 Ann. d.

Poincare 7 and by M. Abraham 8 . By 1910, it was said 9 that the consequence of these pronouncements left three alternatives: 1. Modify the theory to reduce to zero the resu ltant force on an element of free aether (as with Maxw ell, Hertz, and Einstein); 2. Assume the force sets aether in motion (as with Helmholtz); 3.

That is why there must be no more war\" With the government's spurning of his defense suggestions, Tesla's only recourse was to withhold his secr ets from the world, and to dissuade discovery in their direction. In 1929, Tesla ridiculed Heinri ch Hertz's 1887-89 experiments purportedly proving the Maxwellian \"structureless\" ether filling all space, \"of inconceivabl e tenuity yet solid and possessed of rigidity incomparably greater than the hardest steel\". Tesl a's arguments were to the contrary, saying he had always believed in a \"gaseous\" ether in which he had observed waves more akin to sound waves. He recounted how he had developed a \"new form of vacuum tube\" in 1896 (which I call the \"Tesla bulb\"), \"...capable of being charged to any desired potential, and operated it with effective pressu res of about 4,000,000 volts.\" He described how purplish coronal discharges about the bulb when in use, verified th e existence of \"particles smaller than air\", and a gas so light that an earth-sized vol ume would weigh only 1/20 pound.

His 1929 at tack on the Maxwellian/Hertzian ether theory—39 years afterward, during the advent of Relativism— seemed relevant only to his concealed theory, not to disclose it or promote it, but to conceal it. THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY What were the old ether physicis ts referring to when they attempted to describe \"an incompre ssible, perfect fluid\"? What would a \"perfect fluid\" do? It would be able to \"wet\" everything it came into contact with, such as protons, a nd could flow everywhere without resistance. One \"fluid\"— the ether—could flow everywhere, and because of its density and ultra-fineness , nothing could stop it , and it felt ao resistance, but only matter fe lt resistance, depending on the circumstances. Another fluid—electri city—could flow in certain places, and wet only certain things, but often met resistance. In order to understand the ether, we must get to know electricity more intimately. Just like water, a proton will hold only so much electricity on its surface, but the 's urface' of the pr oton is probably similar to the outer area of a ball-sh aped swarm of hove ring mechanical bees, powered by the ZPR, with a denser agglomeration of \"bees\" toward the 'ball's' center. If this swarm of bees is subjected to a wave of rainy mist (the etheric 'w ind'), the bees must a ll turn to face into the etheric wind to maintain their formation. The 'water' droplets—electric sub-charges carried by the etheri c wind—tend to agglomerate around the front side. Each bee, as he flap s his wings, will get wet only so much, so that excess 'wat er' is thrown off and carried to the next bee, or the next swarm of bees, by the etheric wind, and so forth, so that a 'current' of droplets continues to flow through the ball of bees due to its motion through the etheric wind, and tran sfers momentum between masses. The 'water' tends to co me off in larger drops, which have formed from smaller droplets accu mulated on each bee. As in fluid mechanics. 75"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"the 'drop' size is the result of cohesiveness of the electric 'fluid', the surface area of each 'bee', and the sp ace between each bee, all of which influences the final size of each larg er 'drop' (the \"electron\") which accumulates enough to form it. If one were to mathematic ally analyze the flow of \"drops\" (i.e., \"quanta\") per mass unit, they would have an average rate of the flow of charges/cm 3 of etheric wind, for the momentum, as determined by the \"current\" flow rate. Much like the bees, as a body (i ts many electrons , atoms, and molecules, with plenty of 'space' within and betwee n) sits at rest on the earth, it moves at fantas tic speed through the unive rsal ether field, due to the earth's revolution, orbit, and other motions. In his 1891 A.I.E.E. lecture at Co lumbia College, Tesla said in pertinent part (emphasis mine): \"W hat is electricity, and what is magnetism? \"...We are now confiden t that electric and magnetic phenomena are attributable to the ethe r, and we are perhaps justified in saying that the effects of static electri city are effects of ether in motion\", \"...we may speak of electric ity or of an electric condition, state or effect\", \"...we must distinguis h two such effects, opposite in character neutralizing each other\", \"...for in a medium of the properties of the ether, we cannot possibly exert a stra in, or produce a displacement or motion of any kind, without causing in the surrounding medium an equivalent and oppos ite effect.\" \"...its conditio n determines the positive and negative character.\" \"We know th at it acts like an incompressible fluid;\" \"...the electro-magnetic theo ry of light and all facts observed teach us that electric and ether pheno mena are identical.\" \"The puzzling behavior of the ether as a solid to wa ves of light and heat, and as a fluid to the motion of bodies through it, is certainly explained in the most natural and satisfactory manner by assu ming it to be in motion, as Sir William Thomson has suggested.\" \"Nor can anyone prove that there are transverse ether waves emitted from an alternat e current machine; to such slow disturbances, the ether, if at rest, may behave as a true fluid.\" In his statements, Tesla was bala ncing the various arguments in preparation for his decisi on: \"...Electricity , therefore, cannot be called ether in the broad sense of the term; but nothing would seem to stand in the way of calling electricity ether associated with matter, or bound ether; or, in other words, that the so -called static charge of the molecule is ether associated in so me way with the molecule.\" \"...It cannot differ in density, ether being in compressible: it must, therefore, be under some strain or in motion, a nd the latter is the most 76"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"probable.\" Tesla therefore believed in an ether whic h was in motion relative to earth, becaus e the earth is in motion. The thing which Tesla had realized, was that ether possesses electric charges which are deposited on atom s. In supporting the \"dynamic\" ether concept, he was supporting the \"stationary ether\" concept, since the \"motion\" he referred to wa s \"apparent\" motion of the ether perceived by an observer on earth, relative to a stationary ether. The importance of cosmic motion to the electromagnetic effects of static charges was brought up by Te sla in his lecture: \"About fifteen years ago, Prof. Rowland demonstrated a most interesting and important fact, namely, that a stat ic charge carried around produces the effects of an electric current.\" \"...and con ceiving the electrostatically charged molecules in motion, this experiment al fact gives us a fair idea of magnetism. We can conceive lines or tubes of force which physically exist, being formed of rows of direct ed moving molecules; we can see that these lines must be clos ed, that they must tend to shorten and expand, etc. It likewise explains in a reasonable way, the most puzzling phenomenon of all, perman ent magnetism, and, in general, has all the beauties of the Ampere theory without possessing the vita l defect of the same, namely, the assumption of mo lecular currents. Without enlarging further upon the subject, I would say, that I look upon a ll electrostatic, current and magnetic phenomena as be ing due to electrostatic molecular forces.\" In these statements, Tesla s howed he was aware that any \"stationary\" locale on earth is ac tually in fantastic motion (\"70,000 mph\"). The electrostatic charges \"c arried around\" are currents between atoms and the ether, which produ ce magnetism. The phenomena of 'permanent magnetism' or 'c osmically induced' magnetism are apparently due to electrostatic ch arges 'carried ar ound' by cosmic motion, in the unive rsal ether field. Since no one can hold an atom or molecule perfectly still—because it is in fantastic motion—all at oms and molecules carry currents producing magnetic fields. Since a magnetic fiel d is the product of a current, no one can produce a magnetic field without electricity, moving through or along a conductor, or as electrostatic charges in local or cosmic motion. Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity and MHD method of Spacial Electropulsion brought a cosmic crow ning achievement to the works of Faraday, Wm. Thomson, J. J. Thomson, and Edmund Hall. 77"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION The ether is a universal medium, wh ich fills all space. It appears to be \"dynamic\" relative to an earth moving thousands of miles per hour through space. The ether is normally electrically ne utral, ultra-fine, and penetrates all solid matter. There is also an ultra high frequency, ubiquitous radiation, normally in equilibrium, ca lled Zero Point Radiation (\"ZPR\"), which interpenet rates the ether, and represents electromagnetic radiati on in its finest, densest form, which, in conjunction with the ether, cons erves universal perpetual motion. The ether in conjunction with the ZP R, is the source of all matter and force. \"Energy\" does not exist in physical form , but is \"the ability to do work\", which is equal to \"force ove r time\". The word \"energy\" is a convenient fiction, like \"time\", which is an arbitrary measurement of the rate of motion of matte r through ether-f illed space. All ev ents occur in the present, and the \"past\" and \"future\" are merely metaphors. Electromagnetic disturbances in th e ether extract \"energy\" from the ZPR, which is explaina ble only by an ether theo ry. This \"free energy\", which is virtually unlimited, is uni versally at work, created by the perpetual motion of matter, and the perpetual exchange of stronger and weaker forces, through which the equilibrium of the universe is maintained, the sum total of all processe s equaling zero. Since all solid matter is continually hurling through space, always in motion, it is always subjected to the \"etheric wind\" and ZPR interactions. These effects are not pe rceived except during changes in the orientation of mass or its velocity. All mass and spac e have dielectric properties. Differences in dielectric pr operties cause changes in the electromagnetic displacem ent within mass and th e etheric wind. Earth's electric field creates dielectric displa cement effects within ether and mass within earth's electric field. The difference between the dielectric displacement within a ma ss and the dielectric displacement outside the mass in the etheric wind, creates a down-force in the direction of the negative polarity, as the etheric wind 'blows' through a mass. This is called \"gravity\". Since all mass is in motion, all mass has momentum, even when apparently \"at rest\" rela tive to earth. Momentum is a body's resistance to change in its state of motion. Si nce inertia is also the resistance of a body to changes in its momentum, inertia and momentum are due to the same thing, the resistance of el ectromagnetic micro helical tubules to 78"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"changes in velocity (and relative \"p itch\"), direction, and lateral motions or orientation. Since all space and mass is composed only of \"electric content\", momentum/inertia is elect romagnetic in nature, and can be electromagnetical ly synthesized. All mass contains electrostatic charges, which when \"carried around\" in the ether/ZPR -filled space by celestial or 'local' movement, constitute currents. These currents actually flow betw een mass and the ether, and are integral to the mechanism by which momentum is imparted to mass in moti on. The currents create ma gnetic fields as their equal-and-opposite counte rparts, and give a rotatory motion to combined, bi-directional electric and magnetic fields and currents, around irrotational vacuous ether cores. This rota tory electromagnetic action creates momentum, as the for ce-free \"screw-type\" reaction within mass, creating its motion relative to the ether cores, from which the mechanical force is tr ansferred to the atomic mass with which the electromagnetism is associated. Since these phenomena are electro magnetic in nature, they are synthesized by recreation of the elec tromagnetic conditions which a body would exhibit due to a particular kine tic state. Just as electromagnetic waves of low frequenc y can penetrate a bo dy, waves of higher frequencies—above LR. and below U.V. —can cause the ether to \"assert its inertia resistance\". The technology involves high voltage D.C. 'brush' currents, high frequency currents, rapidly varying el ectrostatic forces, and light/heat beams. The rapidly varying electrosta tic forces \"rarif y\" (stretch) the ether carriers, as the light/heat beam s polarize the medium in the desired direction, as the D.C. brush current s induce the exchange of carriers, creating a vacuum in that directi on, inducing motion. At the opposite end of the ship, high frequency curre nts draw the carriers through the ship, and creates a compression of th e ether, as it penetrates the solid mass and synthesizes th e rotatory micro helica l tubules, which whirl around the ether cores along the polar axis, at a pitc h corresponding to a particular rate of moment um. Since the strength of the electromagnetic in teraction is 10 40 time greater than the gravitational interaction, that much more work can theoretical ly be done in the same time, using the same \"energy\".

I will also give you th e explanation for the heat produced in so-called \"cold fusion\", and a few other free energy processes, all closely related to the at omic hydrogen process an d occult ethe r physics. Over the years, the \"Relativistic Quantum Mechanics\" (hence, \"RQMs\") concealed every process or reaction which could show the invalidity of their theori es, \"...in the inte rest of national security\". Their false theories actually became one of the most important means by which, from the standpoint of the government's secret agencies, that \"national secrets\" were concealed, while at the same time, from the standpoint of the co ntrolling corporate fascists, all 'dangerously efficient' technology which would destroy their iron grip on us, could be concealed. According to deceitful relativist quantum mechanics, all energy coming out of a reaction, must go into the reaction, only from a \"non-ether\" source recognized by them , and only in the discrete \"quanta\" permitted by their misappli cation of Max Planck's earlier quantum theory. The basic idea of Planck's original quantum mechanical theory, was that energy levels of atoms must change in whole number integers (1,2,3, etc.), called \"quant a\", which are base d on the basic charge of a single elec tron, which assumes only certain assigned energy levels in different atoms and molecu les, and is used to define the magnitude of all of the smallest, inte rmediate, and largest possible energy changes of atoms and molecule s. All atomic energy changes must 81"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"conform to the permissible whole number equivalents or multiples of these quanta. Accordingly, energy abso rbed by an atom must fit this stringent criterion. Despite what I consider to be obvi ous attempts to conceal basic physical data conflicting with this principle—as misinterpreted by the Relativists and incorporated into their theory, as if it were exclusively their theory and not that pub lished earlier by Planck—the process I am about to discuss with you has glaring inconsistencies in it, even as described and mis-measured by the Relativists. It is said by them that the process of dissociating diatomic hydrogen molecules into separate at oms as atomic hydrogen, requires the absorption of 109, 000 cal./gram molecule (\"1.9 k.cal./gram molecule\"). Yet, in taking the basic hydrogen atom and considering all its discrete 'quanta'—whether in the atomic or molecular state—it appears to me that there is no state of the hydrogen atom or molecule in which such energy could be \"stored\", even when using the RQMs' theories , especially in view of their i rrational statement that the energy is still possessed by the mo lecule after it has alread y been released! It is their contention that an independent hydrogen atom can only exist as such because it has absorbed an abnormally large amount of heat, despite the fact that by their own criteria the atom has no mechanism, identifiable by them by which it coul d do so. When two such hydrogen atoms come together with the presence of sufficient initiation energy, the great amount of heat said by the Relati vists to be stored in the hydrogen atom is liberated. The RQMs never directly measured the amount of dissociation energy necessary to bring the hydrogen atom from the diatomic to the atomic state , because they didn't know how to do so, but because their theory said that \"all r eactions are reversible \", they said the dissociation energy wa s the same as the energy released on recombination of hydrogen atoms. Then to make matters worse, they defined the atomic hydrogen (ground) st ate as if it were an excited state, and the molecular state as if it were the ground state. Realistically, the atomic hydrogen reaction can only be satisfactorily explained by reference t o, construction of, or re-construction of, an ether theory. While it may be arguable that the \"binding energy\" between the two atoms of the molecule somehow 'i ncludes' this energy in some undefined and mysterious wa y, this argument ac tually supports an ether theory, because the binding energy must somehow be exchanged with the energy which is released when the molecule forms, consistent with the equal and opposite reaction rule. Otherwise, one is 82"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"expected to believe a ki nd of backwards Orwellian doublethink kind of thing that the RQMs have perpetrate d, since \"...everything is like relative, man.\" This kind of latitude is permitted only for them, while those who disagree are held to a hi gher standard. The doublethink features of Relativism stem from the fact that Albert Einstein was a Kaball ist-Existentialist—and an Illuminist —whose epistemology was a Platonist one. In philosophy, there are two basic epistemologies—theories of the or igin, nature and limits of human knowledge—representing the two basic categories into which the epistemologies of all philosophies mu st fall, and which are supposed to explain how one knows something according to a particular philosophy...by what means they know it...if in fact , they do \"know\" it. Since he who asserts something has the burden of prov ing it, rather than one who disbelieves it, the means by which it is purportedly known, may come into question. No one is legally, morally, or 'spiritually' obligated to believe anything, without reason, or a valid means of knowing it to be \"true\". All ep istemologies are classified as either Platonist, or Aristotelian. The \"Platonist Epistemology\" is so named because of the theory illustrated by the cave analogy, in the ancient Greek Philosopher, Plato's book, The Republic. In Plato's cave analogy, an observer inside a cave, facing the inner wall at night, sees only the shadows cast upon the wall by such things as a passing carava n, projected by a fire burning beyond a road along which a cara van is passing. According to Plato, man cannot know reality, but sees only a 'shadow' of reality, because there is a 'higher world' of 'per fect forms', which exist only 'in heaven'. It therefore becomes obvious how this epistemology follows religious thinking, and that many re ligions have been infl uenced by it as somehow adding 'scientific credence' to their religious ideas, which are based on faith rather than reason. The same reasoning has been used by scientific, philosophical, economic, political, a nd 'spiritual' con-artists for centuries, and every totalitarian philosophy ever known has relied upon this fallacious 'reasoning' whic h is identical to the Platonist epistemology. One wonders how the viewer in Plato's cave would draw the line between 'knowing' a shadow, and a \"shado w of a shadow\", since a shadow might also have a 'higher form', under this theory. The \"Aristotelian Epis temology\" in the m eanwhile—based on the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle's theory—holds that the senses are valid, scientific tools of cognition, which we can re ly upon, to detect the 83"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"facts of perceivable reality, and that we can, by relying upon the facts so perceived, know reality and determ ine other, perhaps unperceivable facts of reality. As can be seen from a comparison of these two epistemologies and their implications, the philosophies and endeavors based on the Platonist Epistemology are mystical fl aky, and/or totalitarian, while the philosophies and endeavors relying on the Aristotelian Epistemology are more rational and objective, especia lly when applied to the natural sciences. It can also be seen that th e use of a Platonist Epistemology by a physicist should be considered unforgivable, while Einstein's theory, built upon this fatally flawed epis temology, has been popularized by the communication monopoly controlled by the power-elite, because it makes a potentially inquisitive a nd questioning society dumber and easier to control. Einste in's image is continually built up as if that of an ultimate and infallible creature who should be re garded as a 'god'. This propaganda not only protects the false theory, but also aids in concealment of valid theory and advanced technology which would end the reign of a world-wide power st ructure of corpor ate-statists, who think society already has all the technology it 'needs', else the elite's 'grip' on the world, held in place by their archaic technology which exploits mineral, industrial, and ba nking interests owned by them, might be torn loose. I would have very little quarrel with a quantum theory of atomic energy levels, were it extended to include an ether theory, as it should have been logically construed, but I take issue with its present development, limitatio n, and misapplication by the RQMs. My position is that they already have applied it to an ether theory, that this application is well concealed, and that this book is needed to begin the reconstruction of these concealed tr uths, for use by the public. While Planck said his quantum theory app lied to a \"system\", he didn't say the Relativist's \"system\"—which came in to existence after his theory—was the only system it could be applied to. Since a rationally extended quantum mechanical theory would not exclude an ether, my \"RQM\" label distinguishes between the rela tivistic misinterpreters of quantum mechanics, and what could be called the \"Integrated Reality Mechanics\" (\"IRMs\"). The atomic hydrogen reaction first came to my attention in 1964, when I was studying industrial processes at Sam Houston State University, in Huntsville, Texas, the year after ta king an introductory 84"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"course in college physics . While reviewing various welding processes in a textbook, my eyes fixed on an older process calle d \"atomic hydrogen welding\". By that time, the process was already considered \"obsolete\". To me, the process seemed valuable, not only beca use it produces such high temperatures—above 3400° F.—enough to melt tungsten—the highest temperatures producible by man—but is also \"self-shielding\", and can be used to weld diverse metals, often without flux, with a concentrated flame producing little h eat distortion, when welding thin metal. In the process, 'normal' diat omic H2 is shot through an electric arc which dissociates it into \"ato mic\" hydrogen, H1 . This atomic hydrogen recombines at the (welded) metal surface, producing the very high heat Though the pro cess interested me then, and always has, I have never seen an atomic hydrogen weld ing unit for sale, for the 31 years hence. Industry's obvious excuse fo r laying the valuable process aside was that it had been 'replaced' by 'better' processes, such as Heliarc, TIG, and MIG we lding, though they rare ly mention \"plasma arc welding\", which has also almost disappeared from the market. Since plasma arc welding is merely an extension of the atomic hydrogen process, using a specially redesigned torch, the 'mysterious' reasons are undoubtedly the same. The process simmered in the inne r recesses of my mind for a few years until 1976, when I rekindled my interest in the process for possible use in welding stainless steel and reducing and fusing platinum metal compounds, because hydrogen reduces such compounds (which must also be shielded from oxygen) to metals. The atomic hydrogen process does not rely upon the combustion of hydrogen with oxygen in the air, but upon the \"atomic\" energy re leased when atomic hydrogen recombines to form th e 'normal', diatomic hy drogen. I still had some unanswered questions, since the variou s welding data at my disposal failed to mention suffi cient specific details. If Nikola Tesla was right, then I am right, that the energy comes from the ether. Because I knew of no source from wh ich to purchase an atomic hydrogen torch, I deci ded to build one, bu t my information was inadequate for proper construction. In the torch I made, the hydrogen gas entered the arc concentrically, around both electrodes, instead of passing through the arc at a right angl e. I also used the wrong kind of arc transformer, so it didn't work as well as it should have. Despite the disappointment, I knew the torch would work better if I corrected the problems, so I kept the torch in my barn until better 85"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"information and sufficient time was av ailable. I excited the curiosity of the industrial spooks, when I rented a large tank of hydrogen at a local welder's supply, and this proba bly contributed to the sudden acceleration of the CI A-maintained judicial harassment I endured between 1974 and 1992 (18 years). They apparently assumed I was exploring the process for its energy potential, rather than for just welding, and they were correct. My torch is shown below: In the '70s, I had acq uired an old English inorganic chemistry textbook 1 , purchased from Los Alamos Sc ientific Laboratory salvage for S.25, which contained a halftone photo of a '30s-vintage atomic hydrogen welding torch, along with some basic data. The torch shown was different from the one I construc ted, in that it used a high voltage arc transformer, and had no mechan ism to strike the arc electrodes together to start the arc, because the high voltage made it unnecessary. It also showed the gas passing at righ t angle through the arc. In this old textbook, it was stated at page 170 (emphasi s mine), as follows: \"Langmuir (1912) discovered that hydroge n at low pressure in contact with a tungsten wire heated by an electric current is dissociated to some extent into atoms:\".... 'This absorbs a large amount of energy, about 100 kcal Per gram-molecule. \" \"... The atomic hydrogen formed is chemically very active. Atomic hydrogen is formed when an electric arc between tungsten electrodes is allowed to burn in hydrogen at atmospheric pressures (Fig 106)\". The text continued: \"Atomic-hydrogen blown out of the arc by a jet of molecular hydrogen across the arc, forms an intensely ho t flame, capable of melting tungsten (m. Pt. 3400 °). This flame obtains its heat from recombination of hydrogen atoms to H2.\" 86"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"\"Hydrogen being set free in a chemic al reaction is often more reactive than hydrogen gas.\" \"...the activity of such nascent (newborn) hydrogen, in the act of liberation from Us compounds, is due to the hydrogen being in the atomic state. \" The following is a copy of \"fig. 106\": In checking this data in a more recent Van Nostrand's Encyclopedia of Science 2 , at page 1311 it was stated in pertinent part: \"Hydrogen molecules dissociate to atoms endothermically at high temperatures (heat of dissociation about 103 cal/gram mole) in an electric- arc, or by irradiation.\" \"...the hydrogen atoms recombine at the metal surface to provide heat required for welding.\" I was surprised to find this in the Van Nostrand encyclopedia, but I also found that in 1910, the D. Van Nostrand Company published a book by Haller and Cunningham, entitled The High Frequency Coil, (The construction of a Tesla Coil fo r the advanced am ateur. 119 pages), so there is a record of sorts, of Van Nostrand's association with Tesla."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"SMOKESCREENS FROM ACADEMIA It seemed odd to me th at it was later suggested that the 103 calories of dissociation energy absorbed from a very brief exposure to the arc is the same heat as that \"...required for welding\" as described, and I believed it to be more reas onable that the excess heat had to come from \"elsewhere\". The dissociation ener gy would be analogical to a slice of bread (@4 cal. gram), and the gross output would be equivalent to 60 loaves of bread (@1814 cal. lb.), cal orie-wise. There was too much disparity between the two, with pl enty of suspici ous omissions and confusions, in an obvious attempt to cover up the truth in between. The older text showed the clearer construction of a device, and the newer text showed that only 103 cal ./gram mole were required for dissociation, while the older text showed that 100,000 cal./gram mole were liberated on recombination. Only by jumping back and forth between the two sources was I able to put a complete documentation together, and discover the conflicts. It was apparent from the newer text, that the writers intended for us to believe that the final 100 k.cal./gram molecule heat—later upped to 109 k.cal/gram molecule—was abso rbed from the arc, but the 103 cal./gram molecule dissociation heat figure showed a net 108,897 cal./gram molecule unexplained. If there are about 65 cubic centimeters per mole of hydrogen at its critical volume, it seemed highly unlikely that sufficient energy to weld coul d be absorbed from the 'dissociating arc', during the time required for 65 cubic centimeters of gas to pass from the orifice and through the arc. 109,000 cal./gram mole equals 432.6 BTU/gram mole— roughly the heat energy contained in 60 loaves of bread —the \"extra heat energy\" which they have asked us to believe is 'stored' in an amount of atomic hydrogen which weighs l/28th of an ounce, during its brief passage through the arc! How could the tran sformer produce that much energy, especially when it uses only half what it does in conventional welding processes? It seems more likely that excess heat could be stored in molecules than in 'almost naked' atomic hydrogen atoms. What ever happened to Bohr's little atom! It got bigger, and bigger, and ........

Norton apparently was forced by circumstances to rely on some 'scien tists' who represente d the fossil fuel cartels and other conflicting interests, while the older te xt was relatively free of such influences. For example, in the newer text, at page 1311, energy from the combustion of hydrogen was stated at 29,000 calories per gram ( 52,200 BTU/lb). In the older text, this valu e was given at 62,100 BTU per pound of hydrogen, with a comparative va lue for gasoline (\"petroleum\") at 19,800 BTU per pound (stretched to 20,825 BTU per pound in the newer encyclopedia). These figures roughly comporte d with those in the encyclopedia for n-Heptane (\"gasolin e\") at 19,314 BTU/lb, and hydrogen at 51,571.4 BTU/lb, whic h are more or less repeat ed at page 1137, with n-Heptane at 10,737.2 cal./gram, and Hydrogen at 28,669.6 cal./gram, yet nowhere in the newer text was th e total output from atomic hydrogen given that I could find, and nowhere in the newer or older texts was it affirmatively stated that the hyd rogen was not \"con sumed\" in the process. The corrected figure (52,200 BTU/lb) shows, in a comparison between the combustion of \" normal hydrogen\" (to form H 2 O or water) and gasoline (to form CO 2 ), that hydrogen has a yield of roughly 2.7 times that of gasoline, by weight. Then we come to a comparison between gasoline and atomic hydrogen. Though the two can be compared BTU- for-BTU and pound-for-p ound, showing atomic hydrogen's phenomenal output, the real measure of the atom ic hydrogen process is gleaned only from a comparison between the \"input energy\"—103 cal./gram molecule- ~and the net output. The \"input energy\" woul d be \"unity\" for the process, because the process does no t 'consume' the hydrogen, but only returns it to its associated state as H 2 .

The energy require d to pump the recombined hydrogen to a holding tank, be fore being recycled and shot back across the arc and into the r eaction chamber once again, is not considered in this computation. This energy should be negligible, since the dissociation energy is barely mo re than a thousandth of the gross output, and there is probably a way to make the process work without a pump anyway. The manipulators of informati on have both lied and made the direct comparison between atomic hyd rogen and gasoline as difficult as possible, but I have wa ded through a multi-step mathematical, physical, chemical and unitary process to ge t to the truth. Atomic hydrogen produces over 109 k.cal./ gram molecule, which is 109,000 k.cal./kilo. Minus the 103 cal./gram mole endothe rmic dissociation energy, and a net of 108,897 k.cal./kilo is left. A kilo equals 2.205 lbs., so a pound equals 453.51 grams. You must divide the net cal ./kilo by lb./kilo to get cal./lb., then multiply this times °F /°C (1.8) to get °F/lb. This is th en divided by grams/lb. to get 196,015 BTU/lb. The gross is 196.200 btu/lb. In comparison to 19,3 14 BTU/lb for n-Heptane, atomic hydrogen has 10.5 times the energy per pound (of H1 per gal. of H 2 O). There is an easier mathematical process, but this shows more clearly what I did. No wonder the process \"went out of use\". With this process, a home consumer would pay nothing for fuel , because he could produce a small amount of hydrogen in hi s basement, any time he needed it, and could use it over and over, ad infinitum. He could heat his house, drive his car, and use it for \"home-industrial\", uses .

The population control Nazis will hate me. It is obvious that the reason co rporations like ARCO went so heavily into producing so lar energy equipment in the early '70s, was so they could control and ultimately raise the cost of (free) solar energy, to make it \"competitive\" with ga soline and othe r fossil fuels. There are many ways used in contem porary texts to confuse facts, but the most effective wa y is by complete omission. Such facts could not have been concealed by \"accident\" or mere \"oversight\", because they are too phenomenal. Only by plowing through a tortuous mathematical process and confusing units and othe r factors was the true motive for such concealment revealed for ce rtain, but tell me why I'm not surprised? Conservatively speaking, the atomic hydrogen process bears a 10.5- to-1 ratio to n-Heptane. Would you care for 315 miles per gallon? How about 550,000 miles? It all depend s on how many times you recycle it. The figures for n-Heptane are gr ossly confusing, as one might expect, since it is shown only by co mparison by weight that hydrogen combustion has a 2.7-to-l ratio to n-Heptane. This deception was effected by playing ar ound with differing h eat and weight units, pressures, and volumes, and the di fference between the centigrade and Fahrenheit scales. The \"109,000 cal./gr am molecule\" figure for atomic hydrogen was omitted from the newer te xt, though one mi ght have been able to extrapolate it from some co mplex data stated in other areas where the inquisitive person is not e xpected to look. There was a total absence in the new text or other \"new\" data availa ble to me, of a direct comparison of energy outputs betw een combustion of petroleum and hydrogen, much less the at omic hydrogen process. I have never seen a direct comp arison by any of th e thousands of Ph.D.s in chemistry or physics, wh o should have become aware of these facts during their cursory studies. To make these figures even more ludicrous, with BTU (\"British Therma l Units\"), one would expect the weight to be shown in kilos under th e metric system, in stead of the non- 91 "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"metric \"pounds\". These machinations clearly appear to rely upon the well-founded assumption that all scie ntists who know, are controlled and don't say, and those who aren't controlled, will be considered \"quacks\" if they try. to say. Again, its the usual case of \"T hose who know, can't say, and those who say, will be presumed not to know.\" Another stupid trick us ed is to compare \"s ystem weights\", under the false assumption that the user of hydrogen w ould have to use only the systems they present, raising the \"com parable\" weig ht of hydrogen to gasoline, using cumbersome cr yogenic bottles or hydride storage tanks, etc., when the simple figures clearly show that one-third the amount by weight of hydrogen woul d be needed for a comparable combustion process. When ever hydride systems ar e mentioned, there is an obvious omission of the liquid hydride system developed by Dr. Gerald Schafflander of California, the promotion for which Schafflander and associates were a busively prosecuted by th e SEC, as previously stated in Space Aliens. Yet, the atomic hydrogen process would be more than adequate—even fantastic—with on ly a pound of hydrogen, and one could carry an extra 25 lbs of Dr. Schafflander's liqui d hydride in the trunk. Below is a direct comparis on between the BTU/lb for combustion of gasoline and molecular hydrogen, and the atomic hydrogen process, respectively: Gasoline combus tion (n-Heptane) 19,314 BTU/lb Hydrogen combustion (H 2 + O) 52,200 BTU/lb Atomic hydrogen (H 2 <--->2H) 196,200 BTU/lb Note that the atom ic hydrogen process does not involve a \"consumption\" of the hydrogen, yet ev en if it did, the ratio between atomic hydrogen and gasoline is still 10.5-to-one. Ta ke into consideration also that all the best methods fo r obtaining over a hundred miles per gallon (even hundreds of miles per gallon) of gasoline in automobile engines, utilize the vaporization of ga soline and mixture of it with air prior to combustion, something whic h is easier to do with hydrogen, because it is in a gaseous state at normal temperatures and pressures. Also consider that while n-Heptane is a 'purer' gasoline, it hasn't been available for years, and most \"gasoline\" is a d ilute mixture with water and various additives, wi th only about 50% n-Hept ane, so I'm being as kind as I can be to \"gasoline\".

Is this free energy, or what?! Though the facts of this \"secret\" hydrogen process are \"hidden in plain sight\", one must beware of th e disinformation, as well as the common mistakes created by \"scienti sts\" who have been duped by the RQMs. For example, in th e 1976 Norton Encyclopedia, 5th Edition, page 1311, most of the pertinent fact s about hydrogen are shown.

How many books would I have to s earch to find such a 'misprint', especially since I didn't expect to find the anomaly because of the obvious concealment? Yet, in Physical Chemistry (1965) by E. A. Moelwyn-Hughes of Cambridge (Perga mon Press, London), at page 418, appeared the following: \"The Spectroscopic evaluati on of the dissociation energy The energy of dissociation, D e of a diatomic molecule is the difference between the po tential energy of the atoms when infinitely separated, and their energy when the atoms are at re st at the equilibrium separation.\" "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Notice that the \"at rest\" state of the molecules, is couched in language that makes you think that the \"infinitely separated\" atomic hydrogen atoms represents the \"excited state\" for the element. In layman's terms, the RQMs simply made the statement that the dissociation and recombination energies had to be the sa me, because their theories depended upon them being the same . Then they measured the dissociation energy backwards, by measuring the recombination energy, and stating the measurement as if it were the dissociation energy. The statements are supplanted by a lot of RQM gobbledegook, with a \"spectroscopic evaluation\" thrown in like some snake oil, because the spectroscope purportedly \"can't lie\". There is also in the same text, at page 417, the follow ing obtuse statement: \"...In kilocalories per mole, D e is 109.\" If hydrogen atoms exothermically re lease energy when they combine to form molecules, the po tential energy has been lost by the molecules, yet they attribute the \"poten tial energy\" to the hydrogen molecules — backwards —to evade their duty to draw th e logical conclusion. This lie is shown by a graph (\"fig. 4\") purporting to show the \"potential energy of the hydrogen molecule in the ground electronic state.\" This clearly misrepresents, by a Ph.D. in phys ics of the \"Royal Society\", that hydrogen in the \"atomic st ate\" is not in a ground st ate, but in an excited state. In this 1965 physical chemistry text from England, the heat energy generated on recombination of the hydrogen atom is given as 109,000 cal./gram mole, then misrepresented as the \"potential energy\" of the \"ground state hydrogen molecules \" which have just formed! But the \"ground state\" of hydrogen is the atomic state, with the electron at its lowest level of energy, so the RQMs are hoist by their own petards, since there is no way the ground state atoms could \"store\" the 109,000 cal./gram molecule. Where, exac tly would this energy \"reside\"? Concurrently, this same figure is fa lsely equated with the heat generated exothermally when tw o hydrogen atoms—each in its \"excited state\"— come together to form a molecule . Since the heat energy is released on recombination, the molecu les lack the potential en ergy already released. The potential energy of the separate atoms in their ground states, is greater than that of the molecules, because the heat energy is released from the entrained ethe r and converted ZPR —not from the hydrogen atoms —when they combine to form molecules. 94"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"This is hereby unmasked as Orwellia n doublethink . Since when is the potential energy of the atom of an element measured from its molecular state?

What a strange way to define \"p otential energy\". It is like saying an empty gas can has the potential ener gy of the gas that it takes to fill it up! The unique thing about the hydrogen atom, is that it is \"born\" at the top of the hill! Its astounding prope rties lie in its ability to perform as a \"doorway\" between th e ether and the world of more familiar atomic matter. The relativist statements have be en unwittingly accep ted as correct, because there is no ether or Zero Point Radiation possible under their theories, and the molecules have to have more energy than the atoms separately, because \"E = MC 2 \". The RQMs have misrepresented and concealed this process in whic h separate atoms—with lower MASS — possess more \"atomic\" energy than the molecules! Ha ! These facts on hydrogen show th at E equals MUCH MORE THAN MC 2 . Under relativism and qu antum mechanics, \"so lid\" matter is thought erroneously to be the most \"compact\", \"stored\" form of \"atomic energy\", because the energy is s upposed to be re leased by the \"smashing\" and destruction, or fusi ng together of atoms, which Tesla said was false. It is clearly show n by the atomic hydrogen reaction that Tesla was right and the relativists an d Einstein were wrong, because the hydrogen atoms have more potential energy in a se parate atomic state than they do in the diat omic molecular state! Th is can only be either because when separate, the atoms \"gather\" energy from the ZPR, and eject it from the ether when recombined! In either case, the energy is not stored by the atoms, and no longer possessed by the molecules after release, unless there is an even greate r lie hiding in the relativist bushes. This perverse potential energy falla cy is also a wa y to confuse the diatomic hydrogen molecules with the nascent atomic hydrogen atoms produced by the hydrolysis of water. The energy of hydrol ysis is equated with the energy of dissociation, an d the energy of co mbustion with the energy of recombination, yet the in formation presented here shows that by combining the hydrolysis of wa ter, in which atomic hydrogen is produced directly, with the atomic hydrogen r ecombination process, instead of the combustion proces s—and perhaps throwing the oxygen away—that at least 10.5 times as much energy as the hydrolytic input 95"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"can be produced, in still a third astounding hydrogen free energy process. This is true because the atomic hydrogen process without question releases at least 3.75 times the BTUs by weight, as ordinary hydrogen does in the com bustion process. Ev en the relativists agree that the \"energy of combustion\" equals at least the \"energy of hydrolysis\" (even though it is well known that the industrial production of hydrogen by electrolysis is generally 120% efficient). Production of atomic hydrogen directly by hydrolysis, whic h cuts out a sepa rate dissociation operation, is yet another exciting possibility. It does not expend the electrical equivalent of 109,000 cal ./gram molecule (to produce only 65 cubic centimeters of hydrogen gas). HOW DOES IT WORK? As a \"welding process\" , this process was 'obsolesced' by MIG and TIG welding, neither of which can comp are to its welding efficiency and uses. Since the welding process was its only \"public\" use in the years past, the \"new\" processes allowed industry to toss the \"obsolete\" process onto the junk heap (except for their own 'secret' use of it). The \"new\" processes were promoted by U-Kn ow-Who, motivating their welding suppliers and the electric power companies at their own levels. More archaic tanks, transformers, gauges, torches, electrodes, gases, fluxes, and electric power, etc., etc., to be sold at a hefty profit. If people generate their own hydrogen for weld ing at home, how much equipment, supplies and power will they buy? How does the atomic hydrogen obtain its energy, if not from the \"ether\"? No wonder establishment science doesn't want you to know there is an ether. If we are to believ e the \"law of conser vation of energy\", as interpreted by establishment (rela tivistic, ether-excluding) 'science', this process is impossible, yet using data available from 'standard' texts, I have shown that the i nput energy of 103 cal./gram molecule is somehow either 'magnified' to 109,000 cal ./gram molecule of hydrogen—a multiplication of over 1,058 times—or that, by use of hydrogen as a \"medium\", that the 103 calories is 'seed' energy (called the \"activation energy\"), triggering the atomic hydrogen's appreh ension of a net 108,897 cal./gram molecu le, from the \"ether\". An equally phenomenal \"atomic helium\" process (reported in Space Aliens) is 4.6 times this output . It can be conducte d the same way, and produces the same kind of electrical energy an d radiation-to-heat energy 96"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"transformation, in which \"mass\" is onl y a \"medium\" used in the process.

If these pr ocesses used as much electrical energy as they produced , and electrical energy was the end product sought, what would be the use of the processes, right? At the comparable 30 mp g for n-Heptane, helium could produce 42.86 times as much, or about 1285.8 miles per pound. According to Van Nostrand's Scien tific Encyclopedia, 5th ed., Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. (1976), simple electron bombardment of helium gas, in a special chamber, excites the helium atom to a temporarily radioactive isotope of extr emely short half-life. In this state, the helium atom unpairs its electrons, promotes one electron to the 2s state (in which state it remains for only a very short time), and afterward releases 460,000 cal/gram-atom (per gram of helium), on collapse of the excited atom back to its ground state. The h eat is in the form of photons. This is similar to the process for atom ic hydrogen, as illustrated by my drawing shown on page 102. It is my theory that while the electron clouds are in the excited (expanded ) state, they gather and convert energy from the ZPR. Apparently, as the hydrogen passes through the arc, the electric and magnetic fields, plus heat, provide the activation energy triggering the molecule's 'apprehension ' of an additional 108, 897 cal./gram molecule of endothermic dissociation energy. Ju st exactly could this be possible? Since each hydrogen atom is composed of a proton and an electron (each with a pair of purporte dly equal and opposite char ges) one would expect the binding force between the molecules to be ve ry weak, but when the atoms are separated th ey purportedly expand gr eatly in size—because negative ions are larger than the non-metal atoms from which they are formed—encompassing a greater volume of Omni Matter (my term for the \"ether\"). On recombination, th e atoms shrink in volume, as the excess 'gathered' energy is squeezed out of the ether as free (heat) energy. The \"endothermic\" dissoci ation absorbs only 103 cal/gram molecule, yet on recomb ination, the atoms \"exothermically\" yield a net 108,897 cal/gram mo lecule. How exactly does this occur?

This radiation is in (non- relativistic) equilibrium, therefore referred to as \"Zero Point\" radiation. The facts proven by the atomic hy drogen process, explained by the involvement of the Omni Matter and the ZPR, are forbidden by relativity and quantum mechanics, in which a simple harmonic oscillator cannot have a stationary state of zero kinetic energy, because the ground state still has one half quantum of energy and the appropriate motion, yet by relativity's 'other' rules, the principles of kinetic energy has no applicability to electromagnetic radiat ion (the ZPR). Sinc e relativity also rejects the existence of an ether, th ere is nothing in so-called \"empty space\" to contain such radiant ener gy, and the atomic hydrogen process would have to create its energy from \"nothing\", therefore violating the law of conservation of energy, as mi sinterpreted by the relativists, who see all energy functions as part of the 'winding down' products of an \"original'' BIG BANG. You can forget what the relativists said. The equilibrium of the ZPR can be upset by disturbances created in the Omni Matter—which I divide into Omnions (ultra-fine, pos itive \"subprotonic\" particles) and Omnitrons (\"sub-electronic\" charges carried by the Omnions—all of which the ZPR interpenetra tes. Unidirectional vibrations (disturbances) in the Omni Matter cause it to a ccumulate transferred force from the ZPR, throwing Omni Matter out of equilibrium, and restoring equilibrium to the ZPR. The Omni Matter's ex cess force is then transferred through the atomic hydrog en atoms (or other temporarily excited, enlarged atoms encompa ssing it) into the atomic mass frequencies, during disturbance, thus restoring equilibrium to the Omni Matter. This transferred force is not \"energy cr eated from nothing\", but only represents a change in the \"form\" of some of the infinite energy (force overtime), already existing in 'space' in other forms (such as the ZPR, or as \"sub-electronic\" charges). Whenever H 2 is dissociated to 2H (H 1), and the single electron clouds enlarge to encompass more Om ni Matter (affected by a greater ZPR), there is a reaction with and tr ansfer of force from exothermic atomic sources, through the molecules, into stripped Omnions which were entrapped to bind the atoms together. This exothermic energy is sufficient to throw the Omnions within the electron clouds, and concentrated in the space betwee n the atoms, beyond their electronic 98"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"quantum boundaries, so that the addi tional energy needed to dissociate the atoms is regained from the surrounding Omni Matter and ZPR, restoring the equilibrium of the Om ni Matter.

The reason the electron cloud density of the hydrogen molecule is more concentrated in the area around the space be tween the atoms, is because of the entrained Omnions' presence there. Otherwise, the two ne gative charges carried by the two atoms would cause mutual repulsion. Actually, since heat is infrared-spectrum radiation, the pro cess can be conceived as a means of converting the ZPR from an ultra-penetrating posit ive ('cold') spectrum radiation, to a mass-reactive infra red (heat) spectrum radiation, and that is the proximate \"sou rce\" of the so-called \" free energy\", in the form of exothermic heat radi ation. The ZPR is an analog to sunshine, except it penetrates all matter all the time and is not affected by day or night, so it can be converted to usable energy all the ti me with the appropriate technology, such as the atomic hydrogen process. Incidentally, this same atomic hydrogen process, as first published here and now, is also th e apparent source of th e anomalous exothermic heat produced in aqueous cavitation, as well as in the so-called \"cold fusion\" process, which are two othe r free energy processes which are based on the atomic hydro gen process. In addition, it is the phenomenon which was apparently responsible for the cavitation-based, powerful fuelless pumping action produced by the \"Hydro Vacuo Motor\" of John Ernst Worrell Keely, in c. 1870.. The atomic hydrogen atoms have single, unpaired electrons in enlarged shells. These atoms are in Mendeleev' s Group I-a, and all the atoms in that group have unpaired outer el ectrons, and are photo- reactive to and transmute when exposed to ultraviolet light , as do all the atoms of elements below atomic number 19. Some of these elements transmute in visible and infrared light , and all of them can be used to transmute ZPR into usable free en ergy. This photo-reactivity creates temporary, artificial-rad ioactivity-producing isotope s of short half-life, with the emission of photon energy re storing equilibrium to the atoms as they return to their ground stat es. The energy for these radioactive emissions comes from the ether, no t from the atoms themselves. The "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"atoms can be analogized by certain crystals, described by the Raman Effect, in which light passing through th e crystals is \"s tepped down\" to lower frequencies. The infrared sp ectrum light produced by the atomic hydrogen process is thermically re active with normal atomic and molecular matter, because of its longer wavelengths. The transfer of force from the ZPR, via the Omni Matter, through the dissociated H, atoms, is apparently the kind of thing somewhat cryptically spoken of by Tesla, when he stated: \"There is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment.\" 4 In so-called \"cold fusi on\", the electrolytic cel l produces \"nascent hydrogen\", just like in the atomic hydrogen process, and the recombination of the monoatomic hy drogen to 2H releases heat, the product claimed. This atomic hydrogen process also proves Tesla's theory that \"atomic energy\" comes from the environment, not from 'smashing' atoms. It proves that \"mass\" does not even enter into the equation, and that Einstein's \"E = MC 2 \" is wrong . Einstein's theory says this process as I describe it could onl y be possible if the hydrogen were 'annihilated', converting its \"mass\" into heat, and otherwise, is impossible. But the hydrogen is s till hydrogen, before , during, and after the process, and Einstein was wrong, wrong, wrong! It defies relativism, Heisenberg's \"uncertainty\" prin ciple, misinterpreted quantum mechanics, and the BIG BANG! Perhaps this or a similar process was also what Leland Anderson referred to in his eulogy of Tesla, when he me ntioned his \"plucking\" thermal units \"...right out of the thin air\" . After all, the hydrogen atoms when in the 2H molecular form ar e smaller, therefore \"compressed\". Compression of a gas releases heat radiation, usually thought to originate with the energy endo thermically absorbed during decompression, but in the case of hydr ogen, the change is effected by the natural, physical proces s of recombination to 2H. The molecular atoms can be 'decompressed' by a slight application of heat of dissociation, because the strong binding force between the atoms created by the Omnions, is more easily weakened by a small amount of exothermic energy sufficient to separate the atoms, so that the Omnions regain their Omnitronic charges fr om the surrounding ethe r and ZPR. Hydrogen atoms have the highest charge-to-ma ss ratio known, a ratio which almost completely neutralizes the protons. 'Decompression' of the electron clouds occur during dissociation, because there is less positive mass within the clouds to pull the clouds down toward the protons. As the 100"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"protons dissociate with application of the 103 cal/gram molecule, this allows the greatly expanded electron clouds of the atoms to encompass a larger volume or Omnions, carrying sub-electronic Omnitronic charges equal to 108,897 cal/gram mo lecule, from th e only source available, the ZPR and Omni Matter (A.K .A., \"ether\"). Since there is no great cooling activity in the proximate area of dissociation, the 'heat' can only come from the Omni Matter and ZPR, and is ultimately a conversion of energy in the form of random, 'cold' ZP R, and Omnitronic charges, into a coherent, utilizable form of heat radiation. This process, though it can be thermally triggered, is not merely a thermal process, because the net energy released is not converted or iginally from thermal energy, but from ZPR and Omnitrons, into infrared (thermal) radiation. Amazingly, the raw data for this process came from ordinary science books, though the oldest text was produced in England, and would be practically unavailable to the average American experimenter. The full magnitude and output co mparable to petroleum was only obviated by conversion of weights, measures, units and temperature scales, into a consistent picture, to obtain the total net outputs. Most physicist or chemists would refuse to believe the results, even if they had calculated them themselves, and would insist that they had erred. This is indeed an inverted BIG LI E, which is told very small , and often. The BIG LIE consists of a denial that th ere is an ether, the distortion of quantum mechanics, and the exagge ration and minimalization of other incompatible measurements, to create a false overall picture. This is then backed up by a vacu um of information, in pu blicly available texts and other sources, crea ted via the National Security Act, by the Fuel/Power Cartels. APPROPRIATE USE OF THE PROCESS Now that we are beginning to understand our atomic-hydrogen, free energy system, and the great ma gnitude of its output, what are its most appropriate and immedi ately applicable uses? The most direct, appropriate use of this technology appears to be to provide heat for homes, as we ll as for home-industrial heating purposes, such as in agriculture. A secondary use would be to produce heat for steam to driv e turbine-powered electric generators, or for motive power for cars, trucks, boats, trains and planes. This system would be excellent if coupled with a refrigerant-driven, closed-loop 101"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"turbo-electric generator, to provide electric power for electro-propulsive flying saucers, the ultimate in private transportation. Since the net output is heat, the firs t order of busine ss is a special heat exchanger, to transf er heat to water or ot her media, or to produce steam for turbine power. Th e heat in the reaction chamber of the atomic hydrogen furnace must be quickly removed by the exchanger to prevent a buildup of heat sufficie nt to melt the reactor surfaces which receive and catalyze the recombining gas at oms. The simplified design shown below is merely a proposal. Years ago, German metallurgis ts developed a hydrogen furnace which used a copper cruc ible in a clos ed system whic h created the \"hydrogen environment\" required for reduction of the platinum group compounds. To withstand the high temperatures required for the reductions, the copper crucible was cooled from below by water, which removed the heat fast enough to prevent melting of the copper, as platinum metals were melted in it with the torc h from above. The occlusion of oxygen preven ted oxidation of the cruc ible and the platinum metals, and insured reduction of the pla tinum compounds by the hydrogen. This idea, together with ov er 45 years famili arity and use of pyro-technology and over 34 years of welding, has influenced the design of this (simplif ied version) atom ic hydrogen furnace: "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"FREE ENERGY SURPRISE Ether, ZPR & \"Environmental\" Energy The following concerns a device which appears to unequivocally disproves Einstein's relativity theori es and proves Nikola Tesla's nuclear theories. Based on material in Space Aliens (pgs. vii, 185 and 187), a researcher invited me to collaborate in a 50/50 development of a device (similar to that shown on page vii), with the prov ision that I not use his name. I suggested using an iron pipe and 15 kv transformer, based on Tesla's use of an iron \"antenna\" in a Colorado Springs experiment. With an approx. .1 amp/120 volt input (12 watts), an output of 48 kw was achieved. Since the K-capture level of iron is 7,110 volts, I suggested tuning the two 7,500-volt legs to 7,110 with a variac (total voltage 14,220), at which the output jumped to 66 kw, a gain of over 38%. With 120 v/.l amps/60 cps/14.22 kv going into the ungrounded device, the output (on the same leads) is apparently superimposed at high frequency, so that, while main taining the high vo ltage 'excitation electric field', the output can be extracted by high voltage high frequency filter and rectifier, thence reduced to usable electric power with an inverter. In \"K-capture\", the i nnermost \"K-orbit\" electron of iron drops into the nucleus, converting a proton into an extra neutron. This appears to render the iron unstable (i.e., \"radioactiv e\" in the Tesla sense), so that it disturbs the equilibrium of and r eacts with the ZPR, converting some of it into an electrical output, via the iron. This de vice has also been said to transmute zinc to mercury, when used in a different way to produce great heat. At this point in time th e device is somewhat of an enigma, which appears to produce great energy. As the device runs it hums, with no arcing, as a cool shaft of air exits its top, with strong electric/magn etic fields about it. Some ozone appears to be forming. This was pr obably (part of) what Tesla meant when he said \"I have a new use for iron\", and \"...it is when things are quiet that something is really going on\".

I have to pinch myself. Then repeat it 10,000 times. When this kind of \"atomic ener gy\" hit a small segment of the unknowing American public—the welders— in the late '40s, there were newspaper stories saying that the trans-Atla ntic voyages of the Queen Mary could be powered by a hunk of ra dioactive material the size of a golf ball. They to ld their exaggerated stories that way when they wanted us to get hooked and pay for it, but today's \"nuclear reactors\" produce electricity at the same efficiency le vel as coal and ga s-fired generators (38%), and we still have to deal with the inevitab le problems of greater expense, entrenched, ar chaic, stagnant \"nuc lear\" and fossil fuel technology, nuclear decay, waste, and probable devastation ala Cernobyl. The stumbling blocks to the us e of hydrogen are actually illusions, created by the co rporate-state coercive monopolists— CommuNazis (A.K.A., IllumiNazis). The atomic hydrogen process was discovered in 1912 by Langmuir, and was developed as a \"weldi ng process\" in the '30s. The DOE 'scientists ' at Los Alamos said the use of hydrogen involves heavy, cumber some cryogenic tanks an d equipment, until a liquid hydride system developed by Dr. Gerald Schafflander of California, was pointed out by me, in a letter to the New Mexican in 1980, totally ridiculing their phony e fforts in 1979. Then Schafflander and associates were prosecuted by th e SEC, because th e liquid hydride stored hydrogen in something like \"rock salt\"—which cracked out at about 70° C. DOE scientists me ntion only the heavier, more cumbersome, solid metallic hydride systems. Scha fflander's lighter liquid hydride system, which uses solar-vol taics to generate the hydrogen, would be a wonderful wa y to store and deliver hydrogen for the atomic hydrogen process. Goodbye, oil cartels , hello atomic hydrogen, it's pay- back time! By the way, the reason my \"cold fusion\" process (using my weird. lead -based cathode) which I tested back in 1980, worked so well (see Space Aliens from the Pentagon 5 , pg. 198), was because Langmuir, back in 1912, said a lead amalgam cathode produced \"nascent (atomic) hydrogen\". Cold fusionists, throw aw ay your palladium cathodes and get lead amalgam! Watch the price of wa ter rise to $1.40 per gallon.
