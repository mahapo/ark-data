In operation, the Lightning Generator spouts a continuous, crackling discharge of pulsating lightning bolts into the air. These waving fingers of electricity will strike any conducting object that comes within it's range. A piece of paper placed on top the discharge terminal will burst into flames after a few seconds'of operation, and a balloon tossed near the terminal will pop as though shot down by lightning. WARNING: You build at your own risk. High voltage is dangerous! use rubber gloves. If you are not familiar with high voltage rules then do not attempt this project until you educate yourself in the use of HV Capacitors and high voltage saftey. See your local library or get a begineers book on electronics from Radio Shack or any other electronic supplier from the web. Construction Building the Lightning Generator is relatively simple. The cost, dep- ending on your scrounge-ability, will be from $35 to $80. Start with L2, the secondary coil, which consists of a 36 1/2-in. length of 1 7/8-in. OD cardboard tubing, wound with a single layer of AWG 30 enameled, copper wire. Choose as perfect a tube as possible and make sure that it is not contaminated with paint or other substances. Heat the tube in an oven to drive out moisture and paint it lightly with varnish or plastic spray. The coil can be wound by hand or chucked in a slow-turning lathe.

Stop winding 1/4 in. from the opposite end of the tube and run a 3-in. length of the wire through a small hole Drilled in the exposed cardboard apparatus. This end will be the top of the secondary. Apply several coats of varnish to the windings for protection and insulation. To make the discharge electrode, fit the top of the secondary with a porcelain, center-fed insulator of any type (length should not exceed 3 in.). Insert a bolt through the center of the insulator and attach the 3-in. coil wire to the bottom end of the bolt. No more than 3/4 in. of the bolt should protrude from the insulator top. Fasten the insulator to the end of the secondary coil with electrical tape or other. Make a wood base for L2 by cutting a 10\" square from 3/4 \" plywood, and fastening a 6-in. long wooden dowel to the center. Use a 3-in. wood screw to attach the dowel, and, or glue it in place. The secondary should fit snugly over the dowel. The 2-ft. length of coil wire from L2 can be brought through a 1/4-in. hole drilled in the platform 1 in. from the dowel. another option for the base L2 would be to use 1/2\" to 3/4\" clear plastic. Primary coil LI. which fits at the base of the secondary, consists of 28 closely-spaced turns of AWG 8 insulated copper wire on a 10 x 5 1/4 in. Quaker Oats box. or use a 4\" PVC pipe. In a pinch, ordinary two-conductor line cord can be used, with the ends twisted together to form one conductor. The box should be varnished and it can be reinforced with a few layers of fiberglass cloth and epoxy resin. To wind LI, secure the first turn at the bottom of the box with a piece of string, then wind clockwise until 28 turns have been made. Do not wind the entire length of the box, but keep the turns as closely spaced as possible. Secure the last winding with electrical tape. Cut a hole in the bottom of the box and slip the completed LI over L2, keeping the secondary centered. The exposed cardboard of the Parts List for Tesla Lightning Generator. Table 1-2. 1.

The Low-Leakage Capacitor You can build a larger capacitor such as our homemade capacitor designs ( see # HVC1 plans ) or you can bui ld the f ollowing. You will need a box about 16 x 20 x 5 i n. for capa citor Cl. A box can be made of 1/4- or 1/2-in. plywood and reinfor ced with fibergl ass. Box siz e is not cr itica l, though t he box must be large enough to hold the c apacitor about to be desc ribed. Glass diel ectric for the ca pacitor c onsists of eight s heets of 16 1/ 2 x 12 1/4 x 1/4-i n. window glass. Cost should run about $30. Cut out seven shee ts of 20- x 9- in. heavy- duty aluminum foil and assemble Cl as fol lows: lay a s heet of gla ss in the box a nd place a sheet of 20- x 9-in. al uminum foil on the gl ass as shown in t he drawings. Pour i n just enough ASA 30 motor oil t o cover the f oil. On top of thi s lay another sheet of gl ass and aluminum foil , but be sur e to revers e the tab or free end of f oil to t hat it pr otrudes fr om the opposite si de of the gla ss. Press all air bubbles from between the gl ass. This done, pour in more oil and conti nue the proces s, always al ternati ng each sheet of foil. Bend the foil tabs toget her on each si de of the capac itor i n order that wires from the rest of the cir cuit can be c onnected to t hem. About three quar ts of oil will be needed f or a 16- x 20-i n. box. Wooden blocks can be wedged around the pl ates as a means of keeping them from shifting . There are a num ber of ways to m ake the spark gap , but the best arrangement consi sts of t wo 1/2-in. di ameter conductor s adjusta ble from 1/4- to 1- in. separ ation. or try a s park plug. A simple gap can be made by mounting two 1/2- in. dia meter bolts through nuts br azed on 1- x 2-i n. metal pl ates. The pl ates are mounted on a varnished wood bloc k at least 1 3/4-in. thick to pr event arci ng around the gap ( see our il lustra tions).

Windings = Clock wise. Figure 1-24 Coil L1 is close wound with # AWG-8 copper coated wire. One end of coil connects to spark gap. The other connects to C1 and to T1. Tuning If the spark-gap is operating, but either a weak discharge or none at all appears at the top of L2, the coil will have to be tuned. This is accomplished by varying the number or size of the aluminum foil sheets in Cl and by varying the effective turns on LI. It's easier to begin tuning by varying the exposed area of the top sheet of aluminum foil and by \"tapping in\" a few turns down from the top of the primary. Maximum discharge generally will be reached with a total variation of no more than two or three turns on coil LI and one full sheet of aluminum foil in Cl. If reducing the number of turns in LI and changing the number of plates in Cl doesn't help, try adding several turns to LI by splicing in additional wire. An additional sheet of foil can be added to the ca- pacitor, but another sheet of glass will be needed also. It is best not to operate the Generator for more than 15 to 20 seconds continuously without an equal time off, as the oil in the ca- pacitor will start to break down, allowing arcing to occur. But if you build our home made HV capacitors or use an old microwave AC or DC capacitor you will get better results. Remember to be careful. High voltage can kill and is much more powerful after it enters a large capacitor, wear rubber gloves."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"TESLA COIL  #372 Copyright 1996 - 2003 C1 T r a n s f o r m e r T 1 Capacitor Spark Gap On / Off SW K1 Spark Gap using 2 large copper wires and Electrical box fasteners You can also use a spark plug or make your own out of wood and 2 separate metals, attach one on top of wood block and one on bottom.

The light will glow even though not connected to any electrical source. This is because the high voltage is traveling through the air. also large, clear light bulbs held near the coil will glow with weird, flowing colors. Bring a grounded, metal rod within range of the discharge point atop L2 and notice the \"bunching\" effect as the sparks leave their random pattern and arc to the rod. The discharge will not travel as far to reach a grounded conductor as it will in open air, since the atmosphere itself acts as the opposite electrical pole. A pinwheel rotor about 6 to 8 in. in diameter can be made from AWG 18 or 20 solid wire and fitted atop the discharge terminal so that it can rotate freely. When the Generator is operating, the rotor will turn from the force of the discharge leaving the ends of the wire. Place a piece of paper on the terminal and close the switch. In a few seconds, the paper will burst into flames. Despite the extremely high voltages, the Lightning Generator develops very little current, making a shock from the coil relatively harmless. However, the currents in the rest of the circuit are very dangerous, so they must be treated with respect. The discharge is virtually impossible to contain. Try inverting a glass tumbler over the discharge electrode; the discharge will pass right through, leaving the glass full of ozone. A heavy, waving arc will easily crackle across a distance of a foot or more to reach a metal rod. To capture the lightning on film, use a camera capable of at least l/250th sec. shutter speed and try a variety of f-stops. Balloons can be shot down simply by tossing them at the terminal, and sometimes the effective range of the lightning \"anti-aircraft\" is surprising. With reasonable maintenance, the Generator will last indefinitely. Research it and you will discover new experiments and gain insight into the fundamentals of tuned circuits. transmit radio waves to any AM radio etc... So How Does it Work? The primary coil LI and capacitor Cl together form a tuned circuit designed to oscillate at a frequency four times the natural resonant frequency of the secondary coil L2. By inducing current at the base of the secondary L2 equal to a quarter of its natural wavelength, the induced voltage will reach a peak, every half-cycle, at the discharge terminal at the top of L2. The voltage generated is determined by the inductance of LI and how accurately LI is tuned. The spark gap, allows the capacitor to charge to maximum. The spark gap ionizes and the charge stored in the capacitor discharges across the spark gap and most of the charge"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"TESLA COIL  #372 Copyright 1996 - 2003 Page 8 stored in the electrostatic field of the capacitor becomes energy in the magnetic field that builds up around LI as the discharge current flows through LI. When Cl has discharged to a point where the voltage across Cl will no longer sustain an arc across the spark gap, current stops flowing through LI and the magnetic field therefore starts to collapse. When the magnetic field around LI collapses, it generates a counter EMF (electromotive force) (which also is free energy from a collapsing magnetic field ) or voltage that is almost as great as the voltage from Tl that originally charged Cl. This voltage breaks down the already partially ionized spark gap and Cl begins to charge all over again. Because of the high inductance and low natural resonant frequency of the secondary winding of Tl, this portion of the circuit is effectively nonexistent. Most of the energy pumped into the circuit formed by LI, Cl, and the spark gap remains in that portion of the circuit. The secondary of Tl just adds energy every l/120th of a second. For best results, the oscillation frequency should about 120 kHz. As Cl recharges from the magnetic field around LI, a point is again reached where the spark gap cannot be sustained because all the energy is gone from the winding of LI. This means that the magnetic field has collapsed completely. Once more Cl discharges, and current flow again reverses through the spark gap and a magnetic field builds up around the coil LI. With each cycle of charge and discharge the energy transferred is reduced and would soon die out if energy weren't added by the secondary of Tl. This free energy from a collapsing magnetic field can be used to recharge a battery or capcitor bank. Each buildup and breakdown of the magnetic field induces a volt- age in coil L2 which discharges from the tip of L2 in the form of lightning-like flashes and streaks."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"TESLA COIL  #372 Copyright 1996 - 2003 Page 9 ALUMINUM FOIL ALUMINUM FOIL GLASS GLASS TAPE 9 “ 1 2 ½ ” 16 ½ “ 4” Fig. 1-18 Top View Fig. 1-19 Side View + + _ _ Aluminum Foil must be taped to the glass, Foil side up.
