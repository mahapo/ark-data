[{"pageContent":"NIKOLA TESLA AND THE ¨369 CODE¨.Decoding God's ThumbprintNikola Tesla did countless mysterious experiments, but he was a whole othermystery on his own.[Image00000.jpg]Almost all genius Minds have a certain obsession, Nikola Tesla had a pretty bigone.[Image00001.jpg]Tesla had some interesting habits that he would do, for example he would walk onthe block repeatedly three times before entering a building.[Image00002.jpg] He would clean his plates with 18 napkins.[Image00003.jpg] He lived in hotel rooms only with the number 8 divisible bythree.[Image00004.jpg]He would make calculations about things and his immediate environment to makesure the result is divisible by three.[Image00005.jpg]He would do everything in sets of 3, some say he had OCD and others say he wasvery superstitious, however the truth is a lot deeper.[Image00006.jpg]His obsession was not simply with numbers, but especially these numbers 3, 6 and9.[Image00007.jpg]Tesla claimed that these numbers were extremely important and nobody listened,¿But why these numbers? ¿What did Nikola Tesla tried to make the worldunderstand?[Image00008.jpg]First we must understand that we did not create math, we discovered it.[Image00009.jpg]It's the universal language in law, no matter where you were in the universe 1plus 2 were always equal to 3.[Image00010.jpg]Everything in the universe will be his law, there are patterns that naturallyoccur in the universe.[Image00011.jpg]Patterns that we discovered in life, galaxies, star formations, evolution andalmost all natural systems, some of these patterns are the golden ratio andsacred geometry, one really important system that nature seems to obey is thepower up to binary system.[Image00012.jpg] [Image00013.jpg]In which the patterns start from one and continues doubling the numbers.[Image00014.jpg]Cells and embryos develop following this sacred pattern 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,etcetera.[Image00015.jpg]Some Colley's patterns is the blueprint of God math.[Image00016.jpg]By this analogy would be God's thumbprint leaving all religion aside in to avortex math.[Image00017.jpg] The science of Taurus Anatomy, there is a pattern that repeatsitself, 1, 2, 4, 8, 7 and 5.[Image00018.jpg] And so on as you can see 3, 6 and 9 are not in this pattern.[Image00019.jpg] Scientist Marco Rawdon believes these numbers represent avector from the third and fourth dimension.Which he calls a flux field, this field is supposed to be a higher dimensionalenergy that influences the energy circuit of the other six points.Randy Powell, a student of Marco Rawdon, says that this is the secret key tofree energy, something we all know Tesla mastered. Let me explain, let's startfrom one.[Image00020.jpg] [Image00021.jpg] [Image00022.jpg]WHICH MEANS THAT;[Image00023.jpg] [Image00024.jpg]RESULTING THAT;[Image00025.jpg] You can do 7 doubled if you want to, which you would get 14.[Image00026.jpg]So if we continue, we will keep following the same pattern.[Image00027.jpg]As you can see there is no mention of 3, 6, and 9, it's like they are beyondthis pattern free from it.However, there is something strange once you start doubling them.[Image00028.jpg]WHICH WOULD RESULT IN;[Image00029.jpg] In this pattern there is no mention of ¨ 9 ¨, It's like ¨ 9 ¨is beyond completely free from both patterns.[Image00030.jpg] [Image00031.jpg]BUT IF YOU START A ¨ 9 ¨, IT WILL ALWAYS RESULT IN ¨ 9 ¨ .[Image00032.jpg] [Image00033.jpg] [Image00034.jpg] [Image00035.jpg][Image00036.jpg] This is called the symbol of enlightenment.[Image00037.jpg] If we go to the Great Pyramid of Giza, not only are there threelarger Pyramids all side by side.[Image00038.jpg]Mirroring the positions of the stars in Orion's belt.[Image00039.jpg]But we also see a group of three smaller pyramids immediately away from thethree larger pyramids.[Image00040.jpg] We find lots of evidence, that nature uses three-fold andsix-fold symmetry.[Image00041.jpg] These shapes are in nature.[Image00042.jpg]And the ancients emulated these shapes in the buildings of their sacredarchitecture.[Image00043.jpg] [Image00044.jpg]¿Is it possible that Tesla uncovered this profound secret and uses knowledge topush the boundaries of Science and Technology?[Image00045.jpg] [Image00046.jpg]Let's say there are two opposites, you can call them white and black if youwant.[Image00047.jpg]They are like the north and south poles of a magnet, one side is 1, 2 and 4.[Image00048.jpg]The other side is 8, 7 and 5, just like electricity, everything in the universeis a stream between these two polar sites.[Image00049.jpg]Like a swinging pendulum and if you could imagine the movement it's somethinglike the symbol for infinity.[Image00050.jpg] However, these suicides are governed by 3 and 6.[Image00051.jpg] 3 governs 1, 2 and 4.[Image00052.jpg] While 6 governs 8, 7 and 5.And if you look at the pattern closely, it gets even more mindboggling...1 and 2 equals 3, 2 and 4 equals 6, 4 and 8 equals 3, 8 and 7 equals 6, 7 and 5equals 3, 5 and 1 equals 6 and 1 in 2 equals 3. [Image00053.jpg] The samepattern on a higher scale is actually 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 3.But even these 2, 3 and 6 are governed by 9 , which shows something spectacular.Looking closely at the pattern of 3 and 6 you realize that 3 + 6 equals 9 and 6+ 3 equals 9.All the numbers together equal 9 both ways excluding and including 3 + 6.So ¨ 9 ¨ means the unity of the both sides, ¨ 9 ¨ is the universe itself, thevibration, the energy.[Image00054.jpg]And the frequency 3, 6 and 9...[Image00055.jpg]There is a deeper philosophical truth in this, let's imagine what we couldaccomplish if we could apply the sacred knowledge in everyday science.[Image00056.jpg] Nikola Tesla;[Image00057.jpg] [Image00058.jpg] [Image00059.jpg] [Image00060.jpg][Image00061.jpg] [Image00062.jpg] [Image00063.jpg] [Image00064.jpg]¿IS THERE A DIVINE CODE EMBEDDED IN OUR NUMBERS SYSTEM?VORTEX BASED MATHEMATICS SAYS, YES.[Image00065.jpg] [Image00066.jpg] [Image00067.jpg] [Image00068.jpg]¿MEANINGLESS NUMEROLOGY? ¿OR DIVINE SYMMETROLOGY?[Image00069.jpg] [Image00070.jpg] [Image00071.jpg] [Image00072.jpg][Image00073.jpg] [Image00074.jpg]NINE MODELS ¨EVERYTHING¨ AND ¨NOTHING¨ SIMULTANEOUSLY. ¿WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT?[Image00075.jpg] [Image00076.jpg] [Image00077.gif][Image00077.gif]SO, ¿WHY WAS 6 AFRAID OF 7?[Image00078.jpg]THANK YOU FOR READING...The most read...[Image00079.jpg] [Image00080.jpg] [Image00081.jpg] [Image00082.jpg] Search formy books in both Spanish and English version..."}]
