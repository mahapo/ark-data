Allthe electrical devices around us owe something to him. Not only did he inventmany of the gadgets we depend on today, he had a vision of the future, much ofwhich has become reality long after his death. As long ago as 1900, Tesla wroteof a world system of wireless transmission:The World-System has resulted from a combination of several original discoveriesmade by the inventor in the course of long continued research andexperimentation. It makes possible not only the instantaneous and precisewireless transmission of any kind of signals, messages or characters, to allparts of the world, but also the inter-connection of the existing telegraph,telephone, and other signal stations without any change in their presentequipment. By its means, for instance, a telephone subscriber here may call upand talk to any other subscriber on the globe.This is surely the mobile phone network we have over a century later. And in hisautobiography, My Inventions, published in 1919, he envisaged that in ninemonths, without undue expense, he could deliver:• The interconnection of existing telegraph exchanges or offices all over theworld;• The establishment of a secret and non-interferable government telegraphservice;• The interconnection of all present telephone exchanges or offices around theglobe;• The universal distribution of general news by telegraph or telephone, inconjunction with the press;• The establishment of such a ‘World System’ of intelligence transmission forexclusive private use;• The interconnection and operation of all stock tickers of the world;• The establishment of a world system of musical distribution, etc.;• The universal registration of time by cheap clocks indicating the hour withastronomical precision and requiring no attention whatever;• The world transmission of typed or handwritten characters, letters, checks,etc.;• The establishment of a universal marine service enabling the navigators of allships to steer perfectly without compass, to determine the exact location, hourand speed; to prevent collisions and disasters, etc.;• The inauguration of a system of world printing on land and sea;• The world reproduction of photographic pictures and all kinds of drawings orrecords …Here we have the internet, GPS and Satnav. But Tesla was not just a visionarywho delivered theory. He was a practical man who pioneered alternating currentthat made it possible to transmit electricity over long distances, allowingelectrical appliances to be powered by remote power stations, rather than have apower station on every street corner as the earlier direct current systemenvisaged.He is now acknowledged to have beaten Guglielmo Marconi to the invention of theradio. Indeed, he spoke of his world system of wireless transmission the yearbefore Marconi transmitted the first radio signal across the Atlantic. His TeslaCoil, invented in 1891, is widely used in radio and television sets, and otherelectronic equipment. He developed electric motors, generators, X-rays,fluorescent tubes, remote control and radar. However, many of his inventions areunacknowledged because he was so busy developing new ideas to bother patentingthem.Although he was never awarded a Nobel Prize, three Nobel laureates lauded him as‘one of the outstanding intellects of the world who paved the way for many ofthe technological developments of modern times’. He appeared on the cover ofTime magazine and the unit of magnetic induction, a minor planet, a crater onthe moon, an award and an airport are named after him. He was also played byDavid Bowie in the 2006 movie The Prestige.Otherwise, with his talk of death rays and communication from other planets, hisimage endures as that of the mad scientist. But he was far from mad. He was oneof the outstanding figures of the 20th century, arguably more influential thanEinstein, Stravinsky or Picasso, and 70 years after his death, he deserves to bebetter known."},{"pageContent":"PART ONE: STRANGER FROM A STRANGE LAND"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 1 – Birth of a Visionary In my boyhood I suffered from a peculiar affliction due to the appearance ofimages, often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which marred the sight ofreal objects and interfered with my thought and action. They were pictures ofthings and scenes which I had really seen, never of those I imagined. When aword was spoken to me the image of the object it designated would present itselfvividly to my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whetherwhat I saw was tangible or not. This caused me great discomfort and anxiety…Nikola Tesla Legend has it that Nikola Tesla – the pioneer who brought electric light tonearly every home on the planet – was born in a dazzling electrical storm.Sadly, the meteorological records of the Balkans in the 19th century are notreadily to hand. But it would have been a fitting debut for the man who made hisown artificial lightning with sparks up to 1000 ft (300 m) long and thunder thatcould be heard 15 miles (24 km) away. In 1894, before a large gathering ofpeople in Philadelphia, Tesla ran 250,000 volts through his body to demonstratethe safety of alternating current. An eyewitness to his experiments said thatthere was ‘light flaming at every pore of his skin, from the tips of his fingersand from the end of every hair on his head’.On the night of his birth, hearing the thunder, according to family lore, thefearful midwife said: ‘He’ll be a child of the storm.’ His mother responded:‘No, of light.’Born in the dark of the small Croatian village of Smiljan at midnight on 10 July1856, Tesla was ethnically a Serb. His family had left Serbia, then under theOttoman empire, for Catholic Croatia when it became part of the burgeoningAustrian Empire in the 1700s. Both his grandfathers had fought in Napoleon’sIllyrian Army that aimed to kick out the Hapsburgs and the Ottomans, and unitethe Balkans.Tesla’s father, Milutin, was an Orthodox priest and wanted Nikola to follow inhis footsteps. Milutin was a poet and political activist who wrote of a unitedYugoslavia, which did not come about until 1929. His mother Djouka never learnedto read, but could memorize epic Serbian poems and long passages of the Bible.Tesla attributed his phenomenal memory to her. Electric Pet TheoryIt was the Tesla family’s cat, Macak, that introduced the 3-year-old Tesla toelectricity. ‘As I stroked Macak’s back, I saw a miracle that made me speechlesswith amazement,’ he recalled. ‘Macak’s back was a sheet of light and my handproduced a shower of sparks loud enough to be heard all over the house.’ Theyoung Tesla asked his father what had caused the sparks. Milutin replied:‘Electricity, the same thing you see through the trees in a storm.’ It ledNikola to think that nature was a cat and God was stroking it.That night, as it grew dark, Nikola noticed that the cat was surrounded by ahalo from the static electricity in its fur. In 1939, looking back on theexperience, Tesla said: ‘I cannot exaggerate the effect of this marvellous nighton my childish imagination. Day after day I have asked myself “what iselectricity?” and have found no answer. 80 years have gone by since that timeand I still ask the same question, unable to answer it.’ Mother of InventionTesla inherited his flair for inventing from his mother who, he said, ‘descendedfrom one of the oldest families in the country and a line of inventors. Both herfather and grandfather originated numerous implements for household,agricultural and other uses.’ But she stood out even among this remarkablefamily. He said:My mother was an inventor of the first order and would, I believe, have achievedgreat things had she not been so remote from modern life and its multi-foldopportunities. She invented and constructed all kinds of tools and devices andwove the finest designs from thread which was spun by her. She even planted theseeds, raised the plants and separated the fibres herself.He also inherited his immense appetite for work from her. ‘She workedindefatigably, from break of day till late at night,’ he said, ‘and most of thewearing apparel and furnishings of the home was the product of her hands. Whenshe was past sixty, her fingers were still nimble enough to tie three knots inan eyelash.’ While famous for her embroidery, she also devised a mechanicaleggbeater. Infamous Frog CatcherIn his autobiography My Inventions, Tesla recalled his first invention. One ofhis playmates had a fishing rod and set out with friends to catch frogs. ButTesla was left out because he had had a quarrel with the boy. So he got hold ofa piece of soft iron wire, hammered the end into a point between two stones,bent it into shape and attached it to a strong string. Then he cut a branch tomake a rod and, armed with some bait, went to the brook.However, he found that, while the frogs would not take his bait, they would biteon the bare hook. He kept this secret from the other boys who caught nothing,only telling the secret at Christmas, in the generous spirit of the season.Next, he made an early attempt ‘to harness the energies of nature to the serviceof man,’ he said. He attached a rotor to a spindle with a disc on the other endin an attempt to make a primitive helicopter. To power the device, he attachedfour June bugs.‘These creatures were remarkably efficient,’ he said, ‘for once they werestarted, they had no sense to stop and continued whirling for hours and hours,and the hotter it was, the harder they worked.’ But then another boy came alongand ate the June bugs alive. After that, Tesla was never able to touch anotherinsect.He took clocks to pieces and discovered how difficult it was to put them backtogether again. He also made himself a wooden sword and, imagining himself agreat Serbian warrior, he slashed at cornstalks, ruining the crop and earninghimself a spanking from his mother. Tragic Death of DaneTesla possessed a powerful imagination, at that time, filled with superstitionand religious images. They were almost tangible and often accompanied by flashesof light that obscured the real world. He did not think this peculiar as hiselder brother Dane saw the same things.The young Nikola was overshadowed by Dane who, he said, was ‘gifted to anextraordinary degree’. But, when Nikola was 5, Dane was thrown by the family’sArabian horse and died of his injuries.‘I witnessed the tragic scene and, although so many years have elapsed since,’he wrote in 1919, ‘my visual impression of it has lost none of its force.’However, there was another version of this story. In it Dane was said to havedied after falling down the cellar stairs. He suffered a head injury and in hisdelirium accused Nikola of pushing him. Nearly 70 years later he still recalledthe night of Dane’s death:It was a dismal night with rain falling in torrents. My brother, … anintellectual giant, had died. My mother came to my room, took me in her arms andwhispered almost inaudibly: ‘Come and kiss Daniel.’ I pressed my mouth againstthe ice-cold lips of my brother knowing only that something dreadful hadhappened. My mother put me again to bed and lingering a little said with tearsstreaming: ‘God gave me one at midnight and at midnight he took away the otherone.’Following Dane’s death, his parents recalled his achievements, making Nikola’sseem dull by comparison. This undermined his confidence and he ran away, seekingrefuge in an inaccessible mountain chapel that was only visited once a year,remaining there ‘entombed for a night’.The tragedy of Dane’s death never left him. For the rest of his life he wouldhave nightmares about it. And after Dane’s death, Tesla’s waking fantasiesbecame more real and he began to have out-of-body experiences. Childhood TraumasThere were other traumatic events in Tesla’s childhood. After having a bath on asummer’s day, his mother put him outside naked to dry in the sun where he wasattacked by a goose that seized him by the navel with its beak and almost pulledit inside out. He once fell headlong into a huge vat of boiling milk, riskeddrowning swimming under a raft and found himself almost swept over a waterfallcreated by a nearby dam. As well as being lost, frozen and entombed, he claimedto have had ‘hairbreadth escapes from mad dogs, hogs, and other wild animals’.Even ordinary things held hidden terrors. He developed a strange aversion towomen’s earrings. The sight of a pearl would almost give him a fit, though hewas fascinated by crystals. He would not touch other people’s hair ‘except,perhaps, at the point of a revolver’. He would get a fever from looking at apeach and hated having camphor anywhere in the house. Dropping little squares ofpaper into a dish filled with liquid produced an awful taste in his mouth.Some of these strange quirks helped prepare him for the world of science. Hewould count his steps as he walked and calculate the volume of soup plates,coffee cups and pieces of food. Otherwise he did not enjoy his meals. Everyrepeated act had to be done a number of times that was divisible by three. Ifnot, he would start over. Unsettling Town LifeSoon after Dane’s death, Tesla’s father was promoted and moved to an onion-domedchurch in the town of Gospic. There Nikola started school. His father had a wellstocked library, but flew into a rage when he discovered Nikola reading atnight. Fearing the boy’s eyesight would be strained, he hid the candles.Undeterred the enterprising Nikola cast his own and sealed up any cracks in hisroom so the light could not be seen from the outside. Then he read until dawn.Nikola missed the countryside and found himself ill-equipped for life in thetown.‘In our new house I was but a prisoner,’ he wrote, ‘watching the strange peopleI saw through my window blinds. My bashfulness was such that I would rather havefaced a roaring lion than one of the city dudes who strolled about.’Then this shy boy met with an incident ‘the mere thought of which made my bloodcurdle like sour milk for years afterwards’. Coming down from the church belfryone Sunday after ringing the bell, he stepped on the train of one of the town’sgrand dames which ‘tore off with a ripping noise which sounded like a salvo ofmusketry fired by raw recruits’. His father was livid and slapped him on thecheek. This was the only corporal punishment he ever administered. Developing Mind over MatterUntil the age of 8, Tesla admitted that his character was ‘weak andvacillating’. Then he came upon an historical novel called Abafi – which means‘Son of Aba’ – by Hungarian writer Miklós Jósika. In it, the young roué OlivérAbadir gradually mends his ways and becomes a national hero in Transylvania’sfight against the onslaught of the Hungarians, Turks and Austrians. Followinghis example, Tesla set about developing willpower. ‘In a little while Iconquered my weakness and felt a pleasure I never knew before – that of doing asI willed,’ he said.Following the incident of the torn train, Tesla had been ostracized in Gospic.Now he managed to redeem himself. The town had recently organized a firedepartment and was showing off its new fire engine. The entire populace turnedout for the ceremony and speeches. With the hose at the ready, the order wasgiven to start pumping, but not a drop of water came out. While the bigwigstried in vain to locate the trouble, Tesla felt instinctively for the suctionhose that ran down into the river. He found it collapsed. Plainly there was ablockage, so he waded into the river and unblocked it. Suddenly he was the heroof the day and found himself carried shoulder high. Calculus, Coils and TurbinesAt 10 years old, Tesla entered the local Real Gymnasium – the equivalent of aBritish prep school or an American junior high school. It had a well-equippedphysics department.‘I was interested in electricity [chapter-28.xhtml#b73] almost from thebeginning of my educational career,’ he said. ‘I read all that I could find onthe subject … [and] experimented with batteries and induction coils.’He was also keen on waterwheels and turbines, and experimented designing aflying machine which, he realized later, could not work because it depended onperpetual motion. Then, after seeing a picture of Niagara Falls, he told hisUncle Josif that one day he would go to America and put a big wheel under thefalls to harness its power.Finishing at the Real Gymnasium at the age of 14, Tesla fell ill. During hisyouth he claimed that three times he was in such a bad way that he was ‘given upby physicians’. While he was recuperating, the local library sent all the booksit had not catalogued for Nikola to read and classify. It was then, for thefirst time, he came across the works of Mark Twain, whom he would laterbefriend.When he recovered, his father sent him to Karlovac – also known as Karlstadt –to the Higher Real Gymnasium to prepare him for the seminary. Nikola’s fatherwas still determined that his son should follow him into the priesthood, aprospect which filled Tesla with dread. At the Higher Real Gymnasium, he showedearly signs of genius, performing integral calculus in his head, leading histeachers to think he was cheating.Again the Gymnasium at Karlovac had a good physics department. Tesla becamefascinated by the Crookes radiometer they had there. Invented by Britishscientist William Crookes, it consisted of four metal vanes, polished on oneside, blackened on the other, mounted on a vertical pivot in a glass bulb. Themechanism spun when bright light fell on it. It was also in Karlovac, in 1870,he saw, for the first time, a steam train. Contracting Cholera and RecuperatingWhen he had completed his studies at Karlovac, Tesla got a message from hisfather telling him to go into the mountains with a hunting party. This puzzledhim as his father did not approve of hunting, so he ignored the message andreturned to Gospic to find it in the grip of a cholera epidemic. That was whyhis father wanted him to stay away. Nikola soon came down with the disease andwas confined to bed for nine months. When he was at death’s door, his fathertried to encourage him in the hope he would rally. Nikola seized the opportunityand said to his father: ‘Perhaps I may get well if you will let me studyengineering.’ His father replied: ‘You will go to the best technical institutionin the world.’ After that he pulled through.During his recuperation, he would take long walks in the forest. Along the wayhe conceived a way to send letters and parcels between continents via tubesunder the oceans. Mail would be packed in balls that would be forced along thepipes by water at high pressure. However, he did not take into account theresistance to the flow of water and the system would not have worked.He also thought up a scheme to speed up worldwide travel. A stationary ringwould be erected high above the equator, with the world turning underneath it.People would travel up onto the ring, then wait for their destination to appearbelow. He conceded that it would be impossible to build such a ring, but thesethought experiments prepared his mind for later work. He said:I observed to my delight that I could visualize with the greatest facility. Ineeded no models, drawings or experiments. I could picture them all as real inmy mind. Thus I have been led unconsciously to evolve what I consider a newmethod of materializing inventive concepts and ideas, which is radicallyopposite to the purely experimental and is in my opinion ever so much moreexpeditious and efficient.As good as his word, Tesla’s father secured a scholarship for him from theGrenzlandsverwaltungsbehoerde – the Military Frontier Administration Authority –paying 420 gulden a year for him to attend the Joanneum Polytechnic in Graz,Austria. When he has finished, he would then have to serve 8 years in theMilitary Authority. Tesla left for college with a bag covered with theembroidered designs his mother was famous for. He treasured that bag for therest of his life."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2 – Electric Brainwaves It has cost me years of thought to arrive at certain results, by many believedto be unattainable, for which there are now numerous claimants, and the numberof these is rapidly increasing …Nikola Tesla Arriving at the Polytechnic in 1875, Tesla did not study engineering initially.Perhaps in deference to his father, he studied physics and mathematics with theaim of becoming a professor like his Uncle Josif. The Polytechnic had recentlybought a Gramme dynamo [chapter-28.xhtml#b74] which physics professor JacobPöschl used to teach his students about electric currents. During his lectures,he connected the dynamo to a battery, so it would work as a motor.While Professor Pöschl was making demonstrations, running the machine as amotor, the brushes gave trouble, sparking badly, and I observed that it might bepossible to operate a motor without these appliances. But he declared that itcould not be done and did me the honour of delivering a lecture on the subject,at the conclusion he remarked, ‘Mr Tesla may accomplish great things, but hecertainly will never do this. It would be equivalent to converting a steadilypulling force, like that of gravity into a rotary effort. It is aperpetual-motion scheme, an impossible idea.’ But instinct is something whichtranscends knowledge. We have, undoubtedly, certain finer fibres that enable usto perceive truths when logical deduction, or any other wilful effort of thebrain, is futile.Tesla would go on to make a motor that did without troublesome brushes. It washis first great invention. Experimenting with ThoughtWhile somewhat intimidated by his professor’s authority, Tesla was determined toprove that he was right and ‘undertook the task with all the fire and boundlessconfidence of youth’. To take up the challenge of building a spark-free motor,Tesla switched to the engineering course. However, electrical engineering was inits infancy and the course in Graz concentrated on civil engineering.Consequently, Tesla returned to his thought experiments:I started by first picturing in my mind a direct-current machine, running it andfollowing the changing flow of the currents in the armature. Then I wouldimagine an alternator and investigate the progresses taking place in a similarmanner. Next I would visualize systems comprising motors and generators andoperate them in various ways. The images I saw were to me perfectly real andtangible.Tesla was a diligent student – for the first year. He worked from 3 am until 11pm, 7 days a week, taking no holidays. He passed his exams way ahead of hisfellow students. But when he went home with his exemplary exam certificates hisfather was furious. ‘That almost killed my ambition,’ he wrote.It was only later, after his father had died, that he discovered letters fromhis professors telling him to take his son away from the polytechnic, otherwisehe would kill himself with overwork. Carousing and GamblingIn his second year at college Tesla gave himself over to carousing and, in histhird year, he gave up going to lectures altogether. This led to his scholarshipbeing cancelled. He tried to get another scholarship from the publishers of thepro-Serbian newspaper, Queen Bee, calling himself a ‘technician’ and saying hecould speak Italian, French and English, as well as Serbian, Croatian andGerman. It was refused and he was thrown out of school for gambling and, it wassaid, ‘womanizing’. He disappeared from Graz without a word and friends fearedthat he had drowned in the river.In 1878, he re-appeared in Maribor, which was then in the Austrian province ofStyria, now in Slovenia. He found work there as a draftsman in a tool and dieshop, though he seems to have spent much of his time playing cards for money.His father, who did not approve of gambling, found out where he was and came tobeg him to return to school, this time in Prague.A few weeks after his father’s visit, Tesla was arrested as a vagrant anddeported back to Gospic. At his father’s church, he met and fell in love with agirl called Anna. Strolling by the river or on long walks back to his hometownof Smiljan, they discussed the future. She wanted a family; he wanted to be anelectrical engineer. Then his father fell seriously ill. He died soon after,aged 60, and was given a funeral fitting for a saint.Tesla continued gambling. One day his mother came to him and gave him a roll ofnotes, saying: ‘The sooner you lose all we possess the better it will be. I knowthat you will get over it.’He said: ‘I conquered my passion then and there and only regretted that it hadnot been a hundred times as strong. I not only vanquished but tore it from myheart so as not to leave even a trace of desire. Ever since that time I havebeen as indifferent to any form of gambling as to picking teeth.’ He reportedgiving up excessive smoking and coffee drinking with similar ease. And he seemsto have given up his passion for Anna too. The Coming of the TelephoneTesla then honoured his dead father’s wishes. Supported by two maternal uncles,he went to Prague University and signed up for courses in mathematics,experimental physics and philosophy. This introduced him to the Scottishphilosopher David Hume (1711 – 76) and the idea that human beings were born ablank slate that was shaped through life by sensory perceptions – ideas thatwould come into play when he later worked on robotics.The intellectual ferment of Prague stimulated Tesla and, again, he put his mindto building a new type of electric motor, removing the commutator to eliminatethe sparking. Eventually, the money from his uncles dried up. Tesla needed a joband he saw in the newspapers that one of Thomas Edison [chapter-29.xhtml#b83]’sagents, Tivadar Puskás, was setting up a telephone exchange in Budapest, havingalready built one in Paris. Puskás’ idea was to build telephone exchanges inmajor European cities. Until then Alexander Graham Bell [chapter-29.xhtml#b84]had only thought of installing his invention on private lines linking twolocations.However, in Budapest, no work was forthcoming, so Tesla took a government job asa draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office. This bored him and he quit todevote himself full time to inventing. Coming up with no practical idea, he hada nervous breakdown. A Flash of InspirationTesla was only rescued from a deep depression by his new friend Anthony Szigeti.One afternoon they were walking in the City Park reciting poetry. ‘At that age,’he said, ‘I knew books by heart, word for word.’ As the sun was setting, hebegan a passage in German from Goethe’s Faust. The quote concludes:Alas the wings that lift the mind no aidOf wings to lift the body can bequeath me.Tesla said:As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash of lightning andin an instant the truth was revealed. I drew with a stick on the sand thediagram shown six years later in my address before the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers, and my companion understood them perfectly. The images Isaw were wonderfully sharp and clear and had the solidity of metal and stone, somuch so that I told him, ‘See my motor here; watch me reverse it.’ I cannotbegin to describe my emotions.The idea Tesla had come up with was using a rotating electric field within themotor.Although Tesla described his ‘Eureka!’ moment in his autobiography, he did notpatent the alternating current (AC) motor until 1903. He did further experimentson it in 1883 and 1887, and the idea was still not fully worked out when headdressed the AIEE in 1888.However, Tesla had solved the problem that Professor Pöschl had said wasimpossible. He was now convinced he was an inventor, and he had made theintellectual breakthrough that would make him rich and famous.Tesla may have also found inspiration at the works of Ganz and Company inBudapest where AC electrical distribution was being developed. Electricity canbe transmitted down wires with less loss at higher voltages. With AC electricityyou can step up the voltage – and step it down again – using a transformer. Inthe Ganz works, engineers found that a metal ball placed on top of a transformerwould revolve. Later, Tesla would use this in his Egg of Columbusdemonstrations. Passport to ParisEventually, Tesla was taken on by Tivadar Puskás’ brother Ferenc to work on thenew telephone exchange. Tivadar was then in Paris, helping introduce Edison’sincandescent lighting system. When the telephone exchange in Budapest wasfinished, Ferenc sold it to a local businessman and Tivadar offered Tesla andSzigeti jobs in the Edison organization in Paris. Tesla was immediately struckby the ‘City of Light’.I never can forget the deep impression that magic city produced on my mind. Forseveral days after my arrival I roamed through the streets in utter bewildermentat the new spectacle. The attractions were many and irresistible, but, alas, theincome was spent as soon as received. When Mr Puskás asked me how I was gettingalong … I [replied] ‘the last 29 days of the month are the toughest’Employed at the Edison works in the suburb of Ivry, Tesla learned a great dealabout the practical business of building generators and motors. At the time,little of the basic science had been done and progress was made by trial anderror. However, Tesla had the advantage that, unlike the other engineers, he hadstudied physics and mathematics, and could make calculations.His schedule, as usual, was unrelenting. He would get up in the morning at 5 amand swim 27 laps of a bathhouse on the Seine. In the evenings he would playbilliards with his colleagues. Even then, he would explain his idea for an ACmotor, again in the dirt with a stick.In his spare time, he worked on alternative designs for his flying machine andoutlined the specifications for his AC motor in a notebook. It would need threedifferent alternating currents delivered to the motor down six wires at 120° outof phase. This would produce a rotating magnetic field. But he could not get anyof Edison’s men interested. The business making money at the time was deliveringelectric light rather than powering motors. The other problem was that, usingsix wires, rather than the three used in Edison’s system, would use much morecopper which was a major factor in the cost of new equipment at the time.Only one Edison man, David Cunningham, saw the potential in Tesla’s motor andsuggested that they set up a stock company. But Tesla was unfamiliar with theAmerican way of doing business and nothing came of it.He was still suffering from seeing flashing lights. One night in Paris, he said:‘I felt the positive sensation that my brain had caught fire. I was alight, asthough a small sun was located in it and I passed the whole night applying coldcompressions to my tortured head.’However, though painful, these did not worry him. Throughout his life, he said,‘these luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time, as when anew idea opening up possibilities strikes me …’ Secrets in StrasbourgTesla was sent as a trouble-shooter to lighting stations in France and Germany.He oversaw the illumination of an opera house in Paris, a theatre in Bavaria andcafés in Berlin. After helping develop an automatic regulator for Edisondynamos, he was sent to fix the illuminations at the central railway station inStrasbourg, which, in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 – 71, had been taken overby Germany.There had been a problem there when the wiring had shorted, blowing out asection of the wall during a visit of Kaiser Wilhelm I and a German-speakingengineer was needed to sort it out. In the station’s powerhouse, there was aSiemens AC generator. In their spare time, Tesla and Szigeti secretlyexperimented with the prototype of one of Tesla’s AC motors.‘It was the simplest motor I could conceive of,’ said Tesla. ‘It had only onecircuit, and no windings on the armature or the fields. It was of marvelloussimplicity.’The problem was it did not work. The initial trouble was that it used a brassring that would not magnetize. Steel had to be added in various positions. Then,said Tesla, ‘I finally had the satisfaction of seeing rotation effected byalternating current [chapter-28.xhtml#b75] of different phase, and withoutsliding contacts or commutator, as I had conceived a year before. It was anexquisite pleasure, but not to compare with the delirium of joy following thefirst revelation.’ He had finally proved Professor Pöschl wrong. Passage to New YorkTesla tried unsuccessfully to raise money to back his invention in Strasbourg.He returned to Paris expecting a bonus for his work in Strasbourg which did notmaterialize. He tried to find financial backing there too, again unsuccessfully.However, he did catch the eye of Charles Batchelor who had been head of theEdison organization in Paris. He was returning to New York to head the EdisonMachine Works there and asked Tesla to come with him. To smooth Tesla’s passageinto the Edison organization Batchelor got a letter of introduction from TivadarPuskás addressed to Edison, saying: ‘I know two great men and you are one ofthem; the other is this young man.’Just before leaving for America, Tesla spent time with scientists studyingmicroscopic organisms in drinking water. Having suffered cholera before, he nowshunned unpurified water, avoided poor quality restaurants, and scoured thecrockery and cutlery before eating. Later he wrote: ‘If you would watch only fora few minutes the horrible creatures, hairy and ugly beyond anything you canconceive, tearing each other up with the juices diffusing throughout the water –you would never again drink a drop of unboiled or unsterilized water.’His uncles again paid for the trip. The journey to New York was not a happy one.His money and most of his belongings were stolen, and there was some sort ofmutiny on the ship and Tesla nearly got pushed overboard. On 6 June 1884, Teslasailed into New York on the City of Richmond just as the first stones of theStatue of Liberty’s pedestal were being hauled into place. He was 28 years old.Although he spoke English, Tesla had difficulty making himself understood as thecustoms officer recorded that he was from Sweden. Tesla then recalled the clerkbarking: ‘Kiss the Bible. Twenty cents.’ His first impressions of America werenot good. He wrote:What I had left was beautiful, artistic, and fascinating in every way. What Isaw here was machined, rough, and unattractive. A burly policeman was twirlinghis stick which looked to me as big as a log. I approached him politely with therequest to direct me. ‘Six blocks down, then to the left,’ he said, with murderin his eyes. ‘Is this America?’ I asked myself in painful surprise. ‘It is acentury behind Europe in civilization.’He went to work immediately. Passing a machine shop, he saw a mechanic who hadjust given up on trying to fix an electric machine and offered to help. In oneversion of the story, Tesla did this ‘without thought of compensation’; inanother, it was one of the machines he had helped design and he charged $20. Ineither case, legend has that he said: ‘I had it running perfectly in an hour.’"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3 – Meeting Thomas Edison I was thrilled to the marrow by meeting Edison who began my American educationright then and there. I wanted to have my shoes shined, something I consideredbelow my dignity. Edison said: ‘Tesla, you will shine the shoes yourself andlike it.’ He impressed me tremendously. I shined my shoes and liked it.Nikola Tesla Tesla was soon too busy to dwell on the shortcomings of the New World. Thedynamos the Edison organization had installed on the SS Oregon, then the holderof the Blue Riband for the fastest transatlantic passenger crossing, had brokendown, delaying her sailing. Tesla immediately volunteered to make the repairs.He and his crew worked overnight and the Oregon set sail the following day foranother record-breaking run.Returning to Edison’s Manhattan offices at 5 am, Tesla bumped into CharlesBatchelor and Edison, who were just going home. According to Tesla, Edison said:‘Here is our Parisian running around at night.’ They had met before in Paris andseem to have got on famously. Edison recalled:Oh, he’s a great talker, and, say, he’s a great eater too. I remember the firsttime I saw him. We were doing some experimenting in a little place outsideParis, and one day a long, lanky lad came in and said he wanted a job. We puthim to work thinking he would soon tire of his new occupation for we wereputting in twenty to twenty-four hours a day then, but he stuck right to it andafter things eased up one of my men said to him: ‘Well, Tesla, you’ve workedpretty hard, now I’m going to take you into Paris and give you a splendidsupper.’ So he took him to the most expensive café in Paris – a place where theybroil an extra thick steak between two thin steaks. Tesla stowed away one ofthose big fellows without any trouble and my man said to him: ‘Anything else, myboy? I’m standing you a treat.’ ‘Well, if you don’t mind, sir,’ said myapprentice, ‘I’ll try another steak.’ After he left me he went into other linesand has accomplished quite a little.At their first meeting in New York, Tesla explained that he had just returnedfrom the Oregon and had repaired both the dynamos. Edison said nothing andwalked away. When he was a little distance away, Tesla saw him turn to Batchelorand say: ‘Batchelor, this is a damn good man.’ Emulating EdisonPlainly Tesla had impressed Edison and began work at the Edison Machine Works on8 June 1884, only two days after arriving in America. He worked hard. ‘Fornearly a year, my regular hours were from 10.30 am to 5 o’clock the next morningwithout a day’s exception,’ he said.Possibly thinking that Tesla came from Transylvania, Edison asked whether Teslahad ever tasted human flesh. Tesla was also appalled at Edison’s ‘utterdisregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene’, but enquired what the greatman’s diet consisted of. ‘You mean to make me so all-fired smart?’ said Edison.Tesla nodded.Edison replied, perhaps in jest, that he ate a daily regimen of Welsh Rarebit as‘it’s the only breakfast guaranteed to renew one’s mental faculties after thelong vigils of toil’. Tesla began to do the same despite a protesting stomach.But his admiration was undiminished. Tesla wrote in his autobiography:I was amazed at this wonderful man who, without early advantages and scientifictraining, had accomplished so much. I had studied a dozen languages, delved inliterature and art, spent my best years in libraries reading all sorts of stuffthat fell into my hands, from Newton’s Principia to the novels of Paul de Kock,and felt that most of my life had been squandered.The admiration was mutual. According to Tesla, Edison told him: ‘I have had manyhard-working assistants, but you take the cake.’However, Tesla still took the time to enjoy a good meal – the table d’hôte at arestaurant in Greenwich Village with a bottle of red wine – and play billiards,a game he had mastered as a student. According to Edison’s personal secretaryAlfred O. Tate: ‘He played a beautiful game. He was not a high scorer but hiscushion shots displayed a skill equal to that of a professional exponent of thisart.’ Avoiding the AC SubjectTesla set about redesigning Edison’s dynamos, replacing their long magnets withmore efficient short cores, claiming that they gave three times the output forthe same amount of iron. He kept quiet about his AC motor though, perhapsrecalling the indifference of Edison’s men in Paris. Once, though, he wastempted to bring up the subject with Edison himself.‘It was on Coney Island,’ he said, ‘and just about as I was going to explain itto him, someone came and shook hands with Edison. That evening, when I camehome, I had a fever and my resolve rose up again not to speak freely about it toother people.’ Otherwise Tesla and Edison got on well enough. Tesla told thetale of visiting Edison’s office at 65 Fifth Avenue, when the great man wasplaying a game guessing weights.‘Edison felt me all over and said: “Tesla weighs 152 pounds to the ounce” – andhe guessed it exactly,’ Tesla recalled. He asked how Edison could guess hisweight so accurately and was told: ‘He was employed for a long time in a Chicagoslaughter house where he weighed thousands of hogs every day.’Tesla would occasionally dine with Edison, Batchelor and others of the company’stop brass in a restaurant across the road from the showroom at 65 Fifth Avenuewhere they would swap stories and tell jokes. Afterwards they would go to abilliard room where Tesla would impress them with his bank shots and his visionof the future. Arc LightingCompanies that had grown up making arc lights were now moving into incandescentlighting [chapter-28.xhtml#b76], robbing Edison of valuable contracts. He struckback by going into arc lighting which was more suitable for street lighting orilluminating large spaces. He filed an arc-lamp patent in June 1884 and leftTesla to work out the details. Tesla completed the job, but his system wasshelved when Edison made a deal with a dedicated arc-lighting company and, bythen, larger incandescent bulbs suitable for lighting larger spaces had beendeveloped. Tesla felt cheated.‘The manager had promised me $50,000,’ he wrote, ‘but when I demanded payment,he merely laughed, saying “You are still a Parisian! When you become afully-fledged American, you will appreciate an American joke.”’As it was, Tesla could not even get his salary of $18 a week increased to amodest $25. This was a painful shock and he resigned. Later in life, Teslare-assessed his opinion of Edison. When the Wizard of Menlo Park died in 1931,Tesla said:If he had a needle to find in a haystack he would not stop to reason where itwas most likely to be, but would proceed at once with the feverish diligence ofa bee, to examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search … Iwas almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing just a little theory andcalculation would have saved him ninety per cent of the labour … Trustinghimself entirely to his inventor’s instinct and practical American sense … thetruly prodigious amount of his actual accomplishments is little short of amiracle. Indebted to EdisonDespite the rift between the two men, Tesla was indebted to Edison. WithEdison’s former patent attorney Lemuel Serrell, Tesla began patentingimprovements to arc lights and dynamos.In Serrell’s office, Tesla met B.A. Vail and Robert Lane. They set up the TeslaElectric Light and Manufacturing Company. Tesla tried to interest them in his ACmotor, but they were only interested in arc lighting. Together they set aboutlighting the streets and factories in Rahway, New Jersey, Vail’s hometown.Meanwhile Tesla used the patents he had been granted to buy shares.When the electrification of Rahway was completed, Electrical Review featured iton the front page of its 14 August 1886 issue. It was so successful that Vailand Lane decided to run the utility, leaving no role for Tesla. He was bouncedfrom the company leaving him with nothing but ‘a beautifully engravedcertificate of stock of hypothetical value’. He could not even use his owninventions as patents had been assigned to the company. It was the ‘hardest blowI ever received,’ he said. In the winter of 1886 – 87, he was forced to digditches.I lived though a year of terrible heartaches and bitter tears, my sufferingbeing intensified by my material want. My high education in various branches ofscience, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery. Rescued by a PatentIn 1884, Edison had been experimenting with ways of producing electricity fromburning coal or gas. It ended when an explosion blew the laboratory’s windowsout. However, Tesla figured out a simpler – and safer – way to do it, and inMarch 1886, he applied for a patent for his thermo-magnetic motor[chapter-30.xhtml#b117].While Tesla was digging ditches, he told his foreman about his inventions. Itseems that the foreman had been digging the ditches for the underground cablesthat connected Western Union’s head office with the stock and commodityexchanges, and knew Alfred S. Brown (1836 – 1906) who was superintendent ofWestern Union’s New York Metropolitan District.Brown probably knew of Tesla from the article in Electrical Review and wasimpressed by his thermoelectric motor and his AC inventions. The Egg of ColumbusEager to exploit Tesla’s ideas, Brown contacted Charles F. Peck, a wealthylawyer from New Jersey. However, Peck knew of the general prejudice against ACand refused even to witness some tests.‘I was discouraged,’ Tesla said. But then he remembered the ‘Egg of Columbus’.The story goes that Columbus was having dinner with some Spanish nobles whomocked him. So he challenged them to stand an egg on its end. They all tried andfailed. Then he took the egg, tapped it lightly on one end, cracking the shelland denting it, so it would stand upright. As a result he was granted anaudience with Queen Isabella and won her support for his voyage.Tesla told Peck that he could go one better. He would make an egg stand on itsend without cracking the shell. If he could trounce Columbus, Tesla asked, couldhe count on Peck’s support? Peck said he had no crown jewels to pawn, but hewould help.After the meeting, Tesla took a hard-boiled egg to a blacksmith and got him tocast one in copper. Then he placed four coils under the top of a wooden table tocreate a magnetic rotating field. When he turned on the current, the egg beganto spin. Growing faster, it ceased to wobble and stood on its end. Peck wasimpressed. Not only had Tesla gone one better than Columbus, he had demonstratedthe principle of his AC motor. Tesla Electric CompanyTogether Tesla, Brown and Peck formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887.Tesla would get a third share of any money generated. Brown and Peck would splitanother third, and a third would be reinvested. Tesla also received a salary of$250 a month, while Brown and Peck would cover the cost of the patents. Thefollowing month, Szigeti came to New York to work as Tesla’s assistant.They set up a laboratory at 89 Liberty Street above a printing company. Duringthe day the printing shop used a steam engine to power its presses. At night itprovided power for Tesla’s experiments.First Tesla developed his thermomagnetic motor into the pyromagnetic generator[chapter-30.xhtml#b118], using the same principles. Tesla believed this was agreat invention, but it did not work very well and his patent application wasdenied. Nevertheless, Peck encouraged him to continue inventing and his mindturned back to the AC motor he built in Strasbourg.This time, instead of a single coil, he used four coils wound around a laminatedring. Two separate AC currents were fed to the pairs of coils on opposite sides.If these two currents were 90° out of phase – that is, when one was at itsmaximum positive value, the other was at its maximum negative value – a rotatingelectrical field was produced. To Tesla’s delight, the rotor – initially a shoepolish tin balanced on a pin – began to spin.From this prototype, Tesla and Szigeti produced two full-scale motors. Theywere, Tesla said, ‘exactly as I had imagined them. I made no attempt to improvethe design, but merely reproduce the pictures as they appeared to my vision andthe operation was as I expected.’Patents were applied for and issued on 1 May 1888. The motors were then testedfor their efficiency by Professor William Anthony (1835 – 1908) of CornellUniversity and, on 15 May, Tesla delivered his ground-breaking paper A NewAlternating Current Motor to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers(AIEE)."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4 – The Westinghouse Corporation There were many days when [I] did not know where my next meal was coming from.But I was never afraid to work, I went where some men were digging a ditch …[and] said I wanted to work. The boss looked at my good clothes and white handsand laughed to the others … but he said, ‘All right. Spit on your hands. Get inthe ditch.’ And I worked harder than anybody. At the end of the day I had $2.Nikola Tesla Power stations had sprung up across America [chapter-28.xhtml#b76] and Europe toprovide electric light at night. In the 1880s the owners saw electric motors asa way to sell power to factories and streetcar lines during the day. However,most of the power stations produced DC and Brown and Peck were a little dubiousof Tesla’s fixation with AC.Other inventors had used AC to power arc lights. This was particularly popularin Europe where experimenters found they could raise or lower the voltage of analternating current using primitive transformers. Engineers at the Ganz Companyfound that, at a high voltage, electricity could be distributed over longdistances using thin copper wires. Then, to make it safe to use in the home, itwould be stepped down using a transformer. Westinghouse and ACIn 1884, George Westinghouse [chapter-29.xhtml#b85] became interested inelectric lighting and hired the inventor William Stanley Jr (1858 – 1916), whohad invented an incandescent lamp and a self-regulating dynamo. At first,Westinghouse thought of developing a DC system, but abandoned it as the marketwas already overcrowded.For a DC system to be profitable, numerous small power stations had to besituated near to the homes and factories they served. Westinghouse saw that anAC system could provide power to towns and cities where the population wasspread out, reaching a market that DC systems could not serve. There would alsobe considerable economies of scale by using an AC system where the voltage couldbe stepped up and distributed over a wider area, serving more customers. Thedisadvantage was that no one had yet developed a meter to measure how much eachindividual consumer used, nor had a serviceable AC motor been developed toprovide power for factories and streetcars. Besides, Edison had dismissed AC as‘not worth the attention of practical men’.In 1885, Westinghouse imported a transformer [chapter-28.xhtml#b77] made byLucien Gaulard and John Gibbs in London which Stanley began experimenting with.By the time Tesla presented his paper to the AIEE in May 1888, Westinghouse hadalready sold more AC power stations than all the other companies providing DCpower put together. In response, Edison began warning that AC power wasdangerous. Tesla Demonstrates ACIn his paper to the AIEE, Tesla sought to demonstrate the superiority of AC onceand for all. He told the audience gathered in the lecture hall at ColumbiaUniversity:The subject which I now have the pleasure of bringing to your notice is a novelsystem of electric distribution and transmission of power by means of alternatecurrents, affording peculiar advantages, particularly in the way of motors,which I am confident will at once establish the superior adaptability of thesecurrents to the transmission of power and will show that many results heretoforeunattainable can be reached by their use; results which are very much desired inthe practical operation of such systems and which cannot be accomplished bymeans of continuous currents …In our dynamo machines, it is well known, we generate alternate currents whichwe direct by means of a commutator, a complicated device and, it may be justlysaid, the source of most of the troubles experienced in the operation of themachines. Now, the currents so directed cannot be utilized in the motor, butthey must – again by means of a similar unreliable device – be reconverted intotheir original state of alternate currents. The function of the commutator isentirely external, and in no way does it affect the internal working of themachines. In reality, therefore, all machines are alternate current machines,the currents appearing as continuous only in the external circuit during theirtransit from generator to motor.After the lecture, Tesla demonstrated that his AC motor could be instantlyreversed. He provided precise calculations on how the speed and power of themotor could be determined, and he showed how his system could be married up toDC apparatus.Professor Anthony said that, in his test, he had found Tesla’s motors 50 – 60per cent more efficient than DC models. Then arc-lighting pioneer Elihu Thomson(1853 – 1937) stepped forward to say that he had already developed an AC motor.However, his still used a commutator and was consequently inefficient. Teslapointed this out and earned himself a life-long enemy, while he himself wascatapulted to fame. Selling the AC Motor PatentsBrown and Peck now invited bids on Tesla’s patents. Westinghouse expressed aninterest, only to be told that a Californian syndicate had offered $200,000 plus$2.50 per horsepower for each motor installed. The terms were monstrous, butwithout the patents it would be impossible for Westinghouse to develop a motorof his own.‘The price seems rather high, but if it is the only method for operating a motorby alternating current, and if it is applicable to a streetcar work,’Westinghouse wrote, ‘we can unquestionably easily get from the users of theapparatus whatever tax is put upon it by the inventors.’On 7 July 1888, Westinghouse agreed to pay $25,000 in cash, $50,000 in notes anda royalty of $2.50 per horsepower for each motor. Westinghouse also guaranteedthat the royalties would be at least $5,000 in the first year, $10,000 in thesecond year and $15,000 a year from then on. Brown and Peck were also reimbursedthe money they had paid out on the development of the motors. Over 10 yearsTesla, Brown and Peck stood to make $200,000 and $315,000 over the 17-yearlifetime of the patents.As Brown and Peck had negotiated this shrewd deal, as well as bearing thefinancial risk of developing the motors, Tesla gave them five-ninths of thedeal, keeping four-ninths for himself. Moving to PittsburghLater that month, Tesla took the train to Pittsburgh to put his motors intoproduction at Westinghouse’s factory, where he met the great man himself. LaterTesla paid tribute to George Westinghouse, saying on his death:The first impressions are those to which we cling most in later life. I like tothink of George Westinghouse as he appeared to me in 1888, when I saw him forthe first time. The tremendous potential energy of the man had only in parttaken kinetic form, but even to a superficial observer the latent force wasmanifest. A powerful frame, well proportioned, with every joint in workingorder, an eye as clear as a crystal, a quick and springy step – he presented arare example of health and strength. Like a lion in a forest, he breathed deepand with delight the smoky air of his factories. Though past 40 then, he stillhad the enthusiasm of youth. Always smiling, affable and polite, he stood inmarked contrast to the rough and ready men I met. Not one word which would havebeen objectionable, not a gesture which might have offended – one could imaginehim as moving in the atmosphere of a court, so perfect was his bearing in mannerand speech. And yet no fiercer adversary than Westinghouse could have been foundwhen he was aroused. An athlete in ordinary life, he was transformed into agiant when confronted with difficulties which seemed insurmountable. He enjoyedthe struggle and never lost confidence. When others would give up in despair hetriumphed. Had he been transferred to another planet with everything against himhe would have worked out his salvation. His equipment was such as to make himeasily a position of captain among captains, leader among leaders. His was awonderful career filled with remarkable achievements. He gave to the world anumber of valuable inventions and improvements, created new industries, advancedthe mechanical and electrical arts and improved in many ways the conditions ofmodern life. He was a great pioneer and builder whose work was of far-reachingeffect on his time and whose name will live long in the memory of men. Tesla’s TaskFounded in 1886, the Westinghouse Electric Company made $800,000 in 1887 andover $3 million in 1888, despite expensive legal battles with Edison. Even so,Tesla took no salary while he worked there. He did this on principle, he said.Since he devoted himself to scientific research, he would never accept fees orcompensations for his professional services. However, after a year, he was givena 150 shares of capital stock and he was given $10,000 when he discovered thatBessemer steel made a better transformer core than soft iron.In New York, he had lived in a garden apartment. In Pittsburgh, he got his firsttaste of living in grand hotels.Tesla’s task in Pittsburgh was to adapt his motors, which ran best at 50 or 60cycles per second, to the 133 cycles per second used by the Gaulard-Gibbstransformer at the 120 power stations Westinghouse had already set up. They usedthis higher frequency to prevent the lights flickering. Since Westinghouse’schief electrician, Oliver B. Shallenberger (1860 – 98), had adapted anelectrical meter to run at this frequency, it was reasonable to believe thatTesla’s motors could be adapted too. Tesla also had the problem of adapting hismotors to run on the two-wire system used by Westinghouse power stations, ratherthan the four or six wires used to provide out-of-phase AC current to hisprototypes. Encountering Nikola TeslaAt Westinghouse, Tesla’s assistant, was to be Charles Scott (1864 – 1944) whoadmitted that he had only learned that there was such a thing as alternatingcurrent in 1887 after reading an article written by William Stanley inElectrical World.‘I had graduated from college two years earlier, and I wondered why I had notheard of such things from my professors,’ said Scott. Now, a year later, he wasto meet Tesla himself. ‘There he came, marching down the aisle with head andshoulders erect and with a twinkle in his eye. It was a great moment for me,’ hesaid. Scott would later become a Professor of Engineering at Yale, but inPittsburgh he was ‘Tesla’s wireman … preparing and making tests’. He recalled:It was a splendid opportunity for a beginner, this coming in contact with a manof such eminence, rich in ideas, kindly and friendly in disposition. Tesla’sfertile imagination often constructed air castles which seemed prodigious. But,I doubt whether even his extravagant expectations for the toy motor of thosedays measured up to actual realization … for the polyphase system which itinaugurated … exceeded the wildest dreams of the early days. The War of the CurrentsWith the successful introduction of Westinghouse’s AC system, Edison, who wasstill wedded to DC, was on the back foot and a full-scale industrial war brokeout. He launched an all-out propaganda onslaught on the dangers of alternatingcurrent. Westinghouse, who would be the eventual victor, said:I remember Tom [Edison] telling them that direct current was like a riverflowing peacefully to the sea, while alternating current was like a torrentrushing violently over a precipice. Imagine that! Why they even had a professornamed Harold Brown who went around talking to audiences [chapter-28.xhtml#b78]... and electrocuting dogs and old horses right on stage, to show how dangerousalternating current was. Replacing the HangmanHaving collected a list of over 80 casualties, Harold P. Brown was concernedover the safety of electricity. At the School of Mines, part of ColumbiaUniversity in New York City, he began experimenting with animals to show that ACwas more dangerous than DC. In December 1888, Edison brought Brown out to MenloPark to electrocute animals with AC as part of his propaganda war.A number of cities began using electricity to clear their dog pounds. New Yorkwent a step further and set up a commission, under the auspices of theMedico-Legal Society of New York to see whether electricity could be used forcapital punishment. Brown became the official state electrical execution expert.The guinea pig was to be William Kemmler, a 30-year-old alcoholic who had killedhis common-law wife with a hatchet. Edison testified to the committee. Thefollowing day the New-York Daily Tribune carried the headline: ‘Edison Says ItWill Kill, The Wizard Testifies As An Expert In The Kemmler Case, He Thinks AnArtificial Current Can Be Generated Which Will Produce Death Instantly AndPainlessly In Every Case – One Thousand Volts Of An Alternating Current Would BeSufficient.’ The Electrical Review detailed Edison’s proposed method:He proposes to manacle the wrists, with chain connections, place … the culprit’shand in a jar of water diluted with caustic potash and connect therein … to athousand volts of alternating current … place the black cap on the condemned,and at a proper time close the circuit. The shock passes through both arms, theheart and the base of the brain, and death is instantaneous and painless.Brown surreptitiously bought some Westinghouse motors and began experimentingwith larger animals. In Edison’s laboratory he ‘Westinghoused’ 24 dogs, boughtfrom local children at 25 cents each, while Edison himself ‘Westinghoused’ twocalves and a horse. After this demonstration, The New York Times reported: ‘Theexperiments proved the alternating current to be the most deadly force known toscience, and that less than half the pressure used in this city for electriclighting by this system is sufficient to cause instant death. After Jan. 1 thealternating current will undoubtedly drive the hangman out of business in thisState.’ Electrical ChallengeGeorge Westinghouse wrote to The New York Times in protest. Brown responded byusing the letters page to draw attention to Westinghouse’s ‘pecuniary interests’in ‘death-dealing alternating current’ and issued a challenge:I therefore challenge Mr Westinghouse to meet me in the presence of competentelectrical experts and take through his body the alternating current while Itake through mine a continuous current. The alternating current must have notless than 300 alternations per second (as recommended by the Medico-LegalSociety). We will commence with 100 volts, and will gradually increase thepressure by 50 volts at a time, with each increase, until either one or theother has cried enough, and publicly admits his error.Westinghouse did not reply, though Brown was later denounced by the New YorkSun. Under the headline ‘For Shame, Brown’, the newspaper revealed that he hadbeen ‘paid by one electric company to injure another’. Brown protested: ‘I amexposing the Westinghouse system as any right-minded man would expose a buncostarter or the grocer who sells poison where he pretends he sells sugar.’ Buthis protests did no good. Facing The Electric ChairWilliam Kemmler’s execution went ahead on 6 August 1890. It was neitherinstantaneous nor painless. ‘To the horror of all present, the chest began toheave, foam issued from the mouth, and the man gave every evidence of reviving,’said Electrical Review.A doctor present told The New York Times he would rather have seen ten hangings.Westinghouse said they would have done better with an axe, while Edison blamedthe doctors. They had applied the current to the top of the head, though hairwas not conductive, and they had not put his hand in a jar of water. However,next time they would get it right, he said. Brown was notable by his absence.But the damage had been done. Backers began to pull their money out ofWestinghouse and work on Tesla’s induction motor [chapter-30.xhtml#b119] wasabandoned. But Tesla still had faith in his invention and agreed to remove theroyalty clause from the contract if work resumed.‘George Westinghouse was, in my opinion, the only man on the globe who couldtake my alternating current system under the circumstances then existing and winthe battle against prejudice and money power,’ Tesla said. ‘He was a pioneer ofimposing stature and one of the world’s noblemen.’After 2 years, work on Tesla’s motors resumed. The young engineer Benjamin Lammeexamined the patents and the prototypes, and concluded that Tesla had exhaustedall the possibilities of adapting them to run at higher frequencies. He managedto talk his superiors round. Westinghouse had to go over to 60 cycles per second– the frequency of alternating current used to this day in the US – and thecompany simply announced that a young engineer named Lamme had discovered theefficiencies of lower frequencies. Tesla Travels the WorldIn 1889, Tesla left Pittsburgh and went to Paris for the Universal Exposition of1889 where the Eiffel Tower made its first appearance. Edison was there too. Hehad been given a one-acre site to display his inventions and the latest – thephonograph – was causing a sensation. With his new wife, 24-year-old Mina,Edison had lunch with Alexander Eiffel in his apartment at the top of the tower.He also visited Louis Pasteur in his laboratory and received the Grand Cross ofthe Légion d’Honneur for his achievements.Meanwhile Tesla met Norwegian scientist Vilhelm Bjerknes (1862 – 1951) whosestudy of electrical resonance was vital in the development of radio. Whiledining out in Paris with French engineer and physicist André Blondel, he alsoran across the famous French actress Sarah Bernhardt (1844 – 1923) when shedropped her lace handkerchief near his dining table and Tesla rushed to hand itback to her. Legend has it that their eyes met with a burning intensity. TheElectrical Review remarked that he may be ‘invulnerable to Cupid’s shafts’, butSarah Bernhardt may have been an exception. Tesla said much later, that it was ascarf he had picked up, not a handkerchief and he did not return it. He kept it,without washing it, for the rest of his life.While Edison continued his tour of Europe, being feted everywhere he went, Teslapaid a short visit to his family, then returned to New York, where he opened alaboratory on Grand Street. There he began work on lighting and radiotransmission. ‘I was not free in Pittsburgh,’ he said. ‘I was dependent andcould not work … When I [left] that situation, ideas and inventions rushedthrough my brain like Niagara.’ Making Outlandish ClaimsWhen Edison was in London, visiting his power stations, an engineer namedSebastian Ziani de Ferranti (1864 – 1930) was building an AC power station inDeptford, south London, that was able to transmit electricity at 11,000 volts tocentral London, seven miles away. Meanwhile, Tesla claimed that he had a systemthat could ‘place a 100,000 horsepower on a wire and send it 450 miles in onedirection to New York City, the metropolis of the East, and 500 miles in theother direction to Chicago, the metropolis of the West’.This outlandish claim was greeted like those of the current conmen John ErnstWorrell Keely (1837 – 98), who was jailed in 1888 for contempt of court afterhaving claimed to have invented a perpetual-motion machine, and Walter Honenau,who tried to sell pills that, he said, turned water into petrol. However,Tesla’s claim turned out, just a few years later, to be true.Tesla also continued helping Westinghouse with their development of his motor,again taking no payment apart from the equipment Westinghouse provided tofurnish his new lab.Tesla stayed in touch with the men in his family by letter, but usually onlysent cheques to his sisters. He also made an effort to pay back all the moneyhis uncles had spent on him. Uncle Petar had risen to become a Metropolitan –the Orthodox equivalent of a Cardinal – while Uncle Pajo responded by sendingfine wines as Tesla often complained of the poor quality of wine in the US. Hehad little time to enjoy them though. He was working seven days a week, stoppingonly to freshen up in the hotel that had now become his home, or to keep somepressing appointment. Experimental PhysicsRather than working as an engineer, Tesla was now more of an experimentalphysicist. His close friend, electrical engineer Thomas Commerford Martin (1856– 1924), president of the AIEE 1887 – 88 and editor of Electrical World, waswriting an article on Tesla. During their interviews, Tesla would interspersehis diatribes on how his Serbian family had fought off the diabolical Turks withnew theories on electromagnetism and the structure of light.After Martin’s article was published in February 1890, a meeting of the AIEE wasdevoted to Tesla’s AC system. Experiments in the long-distance transmission ofAC current were then being conducted in Germany and Switzerland. Westinghousewas opening a hydroelectric plant at a mining camp in Telluride, Colorado, usingTesla’s AC system and the International Niagara Commission announced that it waslooking at the best way to exploit the Niagara Falls. Whirling through Endless SpaceTesla agreed to present his work on high-frequency phenomena to the AIEE. Themeeting would be open to the public and the journalist covering the symposiumfor Electrical World also managed to sell a piece to the prestigious mainstreammagazine Harper’s Weekly. It said that Tesla had gone beyond noted Europeanphysicists such as Professor Heinrich Hertz in his understanding of theelectromagnetic theory of light.He also put on a number of spectacular demonstrations. In one, light streamedfrom a wire attached at one end to a coil. In another, a fine thread of platinumwire inside a glass bulb span, forming a funnel of light. He produced lightbulbs that worked with just one wire attached, or with none at all, andgenerated huge sparks and electric flames. Electricity, he showed, would run toearth.As a finale, Tesla ran tens of thousands of volts of AC through his body tolight up light bulbs and shoot sparks from his fingertips to show thatalternating current was not a killer when handled properly. Electrical Worldsaid: ‘Exhausted tubes … held in the hand of Mr Tesla … appeared like a luminoussword in the hand of an archangel representing justice.’ Tesla concluded hislecture, saying:We are whirling through endless space with an inconceivable speed. All around useverything is spinning, everything is moving, everywhere is energy. There mustbe some way of availing ourselves of this energy more directly. Then, with thelight obtained from the medium, with the power derived from it, with every formof energy obtained without effort, from the store forever inexhaustible,humanity will advance with giant strides. The mere contemplation of thesemagnificent possibilities expands our minds, strengthens our hopes and fills ourhearts with supreme delight.In the audience was Robert Millikan (1868 – 1953), who won the Nobel Prize in1923 for his work on cosmic rays. He said: ‘I have done no small fraction of myresearch work with principles I learned that night.’ The London LecturesTesla then took his show to London in 1892, where he gave two lectures at theRoyal Institution. There, Tesla said, James Dewar (1842 – 1923), theInstitution’s Professor of Chemistry, ‘pushed me into a chair and poured outhalf a glass of a wonderful brown fluid which sparkled in all sorts ofiridescent colours and tasted like nectar. “Now,” he said, “you are sitting inFaraday’s chair and you are enjoying the whisky he used to drink.”’It was not lost on Tesla that he was lecturing on the same stage where Faradayhad outlined the fundamental principles of electromagnetic induction in the1830s. Again he put on a show of sparks, glowing wires, no-wire motors andcoloured lights that spelt out the name William Thomson, the leading engineer,mathematician and physicist who was in the audience, and who that year, hadbecome Lord Kelvin [chapter-29.xhtml#b86]. Again he ran high-volt AC currentthrough his body, to the amazement of his audience of distinguished scientists.He also melted and vaporized tinfoil in a coil and produced a new type of lampthat would disintegrate zirconia and diamonds, the hardest known substances.Then he described the ruby laser which would not be built until 1960. Most ofthese demonstrations were brand new, not repeats of ones he had given inAmerica.He also demonstrated the first vacuum tube. This would later be used to amplifyweak radio signals. And he concluded the lecture with speculation thatimprovements could be made to the transatlantic telegraph cables so that theycould carry telephone calls, and the possibility of wireless transmission. TheElectrical Review said:The lecture given by Mr Tesla … will long live in the imagination of everyperson … that heard him, opening as it did, to many of them, for the first time,apparently limitless possibilities in the applications and control ofelectricity. Seldom has there been such a gathering of all the foremostelectrical authorities of the day, on the tiptoe of expectation.At the end, he tantalizingly informed his listeners that he had showed them ‘butone-third of what he was prepared to do’. Consequently, the audience remained intheir seats and he had to deliver a supplementary lecture. He then presentedLord Kelvin with one of his early experimental Tesla Coils which would becrucial in the development of wireless transmission.Tesla went on to wow French academicians with a lecture in Paris, before headinghome to Gospic where he found his mother gravely ill. She died soon after. Helater wrote: ‘The mother’s loss grips one’s head more powerfully than any othersad experience in life.’"},{"pageContent":"PART TWO: UNLIMITED POWERS"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5 – Father of the Wireless A mass in movement resists change of direction. So does the world oppose a newidea. It takes time to make up the minds to its value and importance. Ignorance,prejudice and inertia of the old retard its early progress. It is discredited byinsincere exponents and selfish exploiters. It is attacked and condemned by itsenemies. Eventually, though, all barriers are thrown down, and it spreads likefire. This will also prove true of the wireless art.Nikola Tesla While in Europe, Tesla visited the Ganz works in Budapest to see a 1000-voltalternator they were building. He also visited Belgrade where the Serbian KingAlexander I conferred the special title of Grand Officer of the Order of St Savaon him and the Serbian poet Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj wrote a poem in tribute to him.On the return leg of his journey he went to Berlin to visit Hermann vonHelmholtz [chapter-29.xhtml#b88], who developed the mathematics ofelectrodynamics, then went on to Bonn to see Heinrich Hertz[chapter-29.xhtml#b89], who was the first man to transmit and receive radiowaves. Hertz had conducted his experiments with a simple sparking apparatus thatcould transmit radio waves across his lab. However, Hertz was a theoreticalphysicist who simply wanted to investigate the theories of James Clerk Maxwell[chapter-29.xhtml#b87], not an electrical engineer who wanted to put them to apractical use. Tesla had already duplicated Hertz’s experiments and, from them,developed the Tesla Coil [chapter-30.xhtml#b120] which was capable oftransmitting wirelessly over long distances.Hertz had sought to demonstrate that space was filled with a substance calledether, which was both inconceivably tenuous, yet extremely rigid. The reasoningwas that, if light and other electromagnetic phenomena are waves, they must havesomething to propagate through. Tesla maintained that such a substance could notexist and the two men did not get on. In fact, the existence of Hertz’s etherhad already been disproved experimentally by A.A. Michelson (1852 – 1931) inGermany in 1881 and, again, in collaboration with Edward Morley (1838 – 1923) inthe US in 1887 [chapter-29.xhtml#b90].On board ship on the way back to the US, Tesla had one of his epiphanies. He wasthinking about an experience he had while walking in the Alps. Observing anoncoming thunderstorm, he noticed that rain held off until the first flashes oflightning and wondered whether he could use electricity to control the weather.When Tesla arrived back in New York after his triumphal trip, he was greetedwith a photograph of Edison signed: ‘To Tesla from Edison.’ Then Westinghousedropped by with the news that they had won the contract to provide the power forthe forthcoming 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago. The Wireless Transmission of PowerHertz had conducted his experiments with a battery and a simple circuitinterrupter, like a Morse key, connected to an induction coil – a smalltransformer – to produce a high-voltage spark. This could be detected using acopper loop with a spark gap.Tesla quickly realized that, instead of a battery with a circuit interrupter, itwould be better to use an AC current. While a circuit interrupter would onlygive a frequency of, at best, a few hundred cycles per second, an alternatorcould give 10,000 or 20,000 cycles per second. However, once an alternatorreached that speed it began to fly apart, but higher frequencies could begenerated electrically.He had already used induction coils and capacitors – electrical storage devicessuch as a Leyden jar – to give split-phase AC currents to run his motors. Thesecould also be used to increase the frequency even higher. Putting a connectingcapacitor across the terminals of a coil produced a circuit that resonated,giving a spike in output. He called this the oscillating transformer, thoughother experimenters began calling it the Tesla Coil. A coil coupled to acapacitor that resonates at a specific frequency is the basis of all wirelesstransmission.Refining his oscillating transformers, he earthed one terminal to the city’swater main, he moved around New York detecting the electromagnetic wavesgenerated at various frequencies. Abandoning Hertz’s primitive spark gaps, heused other tuned circuits and vacuum tubes as detectors. However Tesla’s aim wasnot to transmit an intelligible signal as we use radio waves now. His goal wasthe wireless transmission of power. The Skin EffectEarly in these experiments, Tesla accidentally touched a high-voltage terminaland, to his surprise, was unhurt. At high frequencies, electricity exhibits whatis known as the ‘skin effect’. The magnetic field created pushes the current tothe outside of a conductor, so it does not run through the body, damaging thenerves and muscles. Instead it travels across the surface, leaving the internalstructure undamaged. In his public demonstrations, he touched one terminal of ahigh-frequency apparatus generating tens of thousands of volts and illuminated abulb or tube held in the other hand. This also showed that alternating current,if at a sufficiently high frequency, was safer than direct current. On the RoadTesla and his lectures hit the road in 1893, and pulled in huge audiences withhis dazzling demonstrations and novel ideas. In Philadelphia, he outlined amethod of transmitting pictures – that is, television. The secret of wirelesstransmission, he said, was resonance. Wires become unnecessary as electricalimpulses jump from a sending device to a receiver if they are tuned to the samefrequency, and he presented a diagram showing aerials, transmitters, receiversand earth connections, all the elements of a modern broadcast system.This was not just theory. He gave practical demonstrations. On one side of thestage he had a high-voltage transformer connected to a bank of Leyden jars, asparking gap, a coil and a length of wire hanging from the ceiling. On the otherside was an identical length of wire and an identical coil and bank of Leydenjars. But instead of the sparking gap there was a Geissler, or discharge tubethat glowed when electricity was passed through it, like a primitive neon light.Not only was the demonstration dazzling, it was full of strange sounds. Whenelectricity was fed to the transformer, the core strained, making odd groaningsounds. Corona sizzled around the edges of the foil on the Leyden jars andsparks cracked across the sparking gap. But the radio waves travelled noisilyfrom one antenna to the other and the Geissler tube lit up.Tesla was advised to play down the possibilities of his wireless system. Itseemed so fanciful it might deter conservative businessmen who might otherwisebe interested in his motors or his lighting systems. Nevertheless, he said, itearned him the title of ‘Father of the Wireless’ among fellow researchers.Others had investigated the phenomenon of wireless transmission before him, butTesla had pioneered the use of the tuned circuit, the aerial and the groundconnection [chapter-30.xhtml#b122]. He was giving these demonstrations ofwireless transmission a full year before Guglielmo Marconi[chapter-29.xhtml#b91] even began experimenting.In 1896, Tesla received a letter from Sir William Preece (1834 – 1913) of theImperial Post Office in London, asking Tesla for two wireless sets for trial.But Marconi was in London by then. He intervened, telling Preece that he hadtried the Tesla system and it had not worked. Nevertheless, Tesla filed a patentfor wireless transmission in September 1897. Conspiring with the DevilIn St Louis, Missouri, 4,000 copies of a small-circulation electrical journalwere sold because it carried an article about Tesla. When Tesla came to town, 80electrical utility wagons paraded down the street. The 4,000-seat Grand MusicEntertainment Hall was filled to overcapacity as several thousand more packedin. Tickets were being sold by scalpers for between $3 and $5 ($80 and $130 attoday’s prices). Tesla did not disappoint, passing 200,000 volts through hisbody. He described the experiment in his published lecture:I now set the coil to work and approach the free terminal with a metallic objectheld in my hand, this simply to avoid burns. As I approach the metallic objectto a distance of 8 or 10 inches, a torrent of furious sparks breaks forth fromthe end of the secondary wire, which passes through the rubber column. Thesparks cease when the metal in my hand touches the wire. My arm is now traversedby a powerful electric current, vibrating at about the rate of one million timesa second. All around me the electrostatic force makes itself felt, and the airmolecules and particles of dust flying about are acted upon and are hammeringviolently against my body.So great is this agitation of the particles, that when the lights are turnedout, you may see streams of feeble light appear on some parts of my body. Whensuch a streamer breaks out on any part of the body, it produces a sensation likethe pricking of a needle. Were the potentials sufficiently high and thefrequency of the vibration rather low, the skin would probably be ruptured underthe tremendous strain, and the blood would rush out with great force in the formof fine spray or jet so thin as to be invisible, just as oil will when placed onthe positive terminal of a Holtz machine [electrostatic generator]. The breakingthrough of the skin though it may seem impossible at first, would perhaps occur,by reason of the tissues under the skin being incomparably better at conducting.This, at least, appears plausible, judging from some observations.I can make these streams of light visible to all, by touching with the metallicobject one of the terminals as before, and approaching my free hand to the brasssphere, which is connected to the second terminal of the coil. As the hand isapproached, the air between it and the sphere, or in the immediateneighbourhood, is more violently agitated, and you see streams of light nowbreak forth from my fingertips and from the whole hand. Were I to approach thehand closer, powerful sparks would jump from the brass sphere to my hand, whichmight be injurious. The streamers offer no particular inconvenience, except thatin the ends of the fingertips a burning sensation is felt …The streams of light which you have observed issuing from my hand are due to apotential of about 200,000 volts, alternating in rather irregular intervals,sometimes like a million times a second. A vibration of the same amplitude, butfour times as fast, to maintain which over three million volts would berequired, would be more than sufficient to envelop my body in a complete sheetof flame. But this flame would not burn me up; quite contrarily, the probabilityis, that I would not be injured in the least. Yet a hundredth part of thatenergy, otherwise directed; would be amply sufficient to kill a person…Waving various shaped tubes in the powerful electromagnetic field hisoscillating transformer had produced, Tesla created beautiful effects like the‘spokes of a wheel of glowing moonbeams’, the Electrical Engineer said.Towards the end of the performance, Tesla held up one of his phosphorescentlamps [chapter-30.xhtml#b121], the precursory of fluorescent lights, andannounced that he would illuminate it by touching the terminal of hisoscillating transformer with his other hand. When he did, the lamp lit up.‘There was a stampede in the two upper galleries and they all rushed out,’ saidTesla. ‘They thought it was some part of the devil’s work.’ An All-American JokeReturning to New York, Tesla acquired his US citizenship. To get back at Edisonfor his jibe years earlier of ‘You are still a Parisian’, Tesla decided, nowthat he was a fully-fledged American, to find out if Edison could take anall-American joke. He set up an experiment pitting a carbon-filamentincandescent light that Edison had invented against an identical bulb that wasempty.Applying a current at a frequency of around one million cycles per second, theempty bulb glowed brightly – more brightly than Edison’s bulb which was beingrun on direct current. What’s more, the empty bulb stayed cool to the touch.Edison was far from amused and, once again, Tesla had shot down his formermentor in the popular press.An incandescent light bulb is only 5 per cent efficient. The other 95 per centis lost in the form of heat. This waste, Tesla said, was ‘on a par with thewanton destruction of whole forests for the sake of a few sticks of lumber’. Tesla Keeps InventingHowever, to Tesla, the attention of the press was a distraction. He went to workincreasing the power of his oscillators until he reached one million volts. Thenhe immersed a high-frequency oscillator in a vat of oil. By modulating thefrequency he could get the oil to rotate at different rates.Tesla then invented a new steam-driven generator that produced as much power asone 40 times its size. Instead of using the piston action of the steam engine toturn a crankshaft and flywheel, which then turn the generator, he put thecylinder inside the coils of the generator so that the metal pistons moving upand down generated electricity. Chicago World’s Fair 1893Westinghouse had won the contract to light the World’s Columbian Exposition, akathe Chicago World’s Fair, in May 1893 by putting in a bid much lower than thatof General Electric, which now owned Edison’s patents. The buildings at the fairwere to be illuminated with 200,000 bulbs, so this was an ideal opportunity todemonstrate how Tesla’s AC system could be used to light an entire city.GE had initially estimated that it would cost $1.8 million to light the fair.When this was rejected, they revised it down to $554,000. Westinghouse came inat $399,000. At that price, Westinghouse had to devise a more economical system.In less than six months, they designed and built bigger generators than had everbeen built before. Using AC at high-voltage, they could distribute thisthroughout the fair on thin wires, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars worthof copper. The fair site would be a blaze of light and consume three times theamount of electricity then being utilized by the whole of the city of Chicago.Westinghouse also had come up with a new design for an incandescent lamp toavoid infringing Edison’s patents and manufactured 250,000 of them. Consequentlywhen Westinghouse went to see Tesla when he arrived back in New York, he had notput much thought to promoting his motors or his polyphase system. But realizingthe importance of the World’s Fair as a showcase, Tesla went to Pittsburgh, hesaid, ‘to bring the motor to high perfection’. Words Are Not EnoughThe Columbian Exposition covered almost 700 acres (283 Hectares) and attractedsome 28 million visitors from all over the world. The centre-piece was a Ferriswheel standing 264 ft (80 m) high that could carry over 2,000 people. Itrevolved on the largest one-piece axle ever forged. But it was Westinghouse’silluminations that took the breath away. Former governor of Illinois, Will E.Cameron said:Inadequate words have been found to convey a realizing idea of the beauty andgrandeur of the spectacle which the Exposition offers by day, they areinfinitely less capable of affording the slightest conception of the dazzlingspectacle which greets the eye of the visitor at night … Indescribable bylanguage are the electric fountains. One of them, called ‘The Great Geyser’,rises to a height to 150 ft [45 m], above a band of ‘Little Geysers’ … sobewildering no eyes can find the loveliest, their vagaries of motion soentrancing no heart can keep its steady beating. Visiting the Electricity PavilionAt the Chicago World’s Fair, the Electricity Pavilion rose to 169 ft (52 m) andcovered 3.5 acres (1.4 Hectares) – the size of two soccer fields. In it, AEGexhibited the equipment they had used to transmit AC the record-breaking 109miles (175 km) from Lauffen to Frankfurt in Germany. GE also demonstrated theirnew AC system. Both were technically infringing Tesla’s patents, butWestinghouse made no objection as it helped demonstrate the superiority of AC.Instead, they erected a 45-ft (14 m) high monument to the ‘Westinghouse Electric& Manufacturing Co. Tesla Polyphase System’.Not to be outshone, GE erected a 82-ft (25 m ) Tower of Light in the centre ofthe Electricity Pavilion, with 18,000 bulbs around the pedestal, which wastopped by a huge Edison light bulb.Other stands showed electric body invigorators, charged belts and electricityhairbrushes. It was then thought that electricity could cure all ills. ElihuThomson exhibited a high-frequency coil that could produce a spark 5 ft (1.5 m)long. Alexander Graham Bell launched a telephone that transmitted sound on abeam of light, while Elisha Gray (1835 – 1901) unveiled a prototype fax machinecalled the teleautography – for a few cents, you could have your signaturereproduced electronically at a distance. Edison himself exhibited hisphonograph, the multiplex telegraph and his kinetescope, which produced movingpictures for an individual viewer.On the Westinghouse stand, Tesla exhibited AC motors and generators, and had thenames of famous electrical pioneers – Franklin, Helmholtz, Faraday, Maxwell andHenry – all spelt out in phosphorescent tubes, along with that of JovanJovanovic Zmaj (his old friend, the Serbian poet). Huge flashing neon signssaying Westinghouse and Welcome Electricians were lit by discharges ofartificial lightning that made a deafening sound. Among the flashing sparks andthe tubes, lit wirelessly, was a large Egg of Columbus spinning furiously. The Wizard of PhysicsTesla visited the World’s Fair in August to put on a week of demonstrations andto attend the International Electrical Congress being held there. Its honorarychairman was Helmholtz, who Tesla showed his personal exhibit. A thousandelectrical engineers attended, including most of the leaders in the field. Tendollars were offered for seats to see Tesla, who was introduced as the ‘Wizardof Physics’. However, entrance was limited to those who could produce theappropriate credentials.Tesla demonstrated mechanical oscillators and steam generators that were sosmall it was said they could fit in the crown of a hat. He produced motors thatcould run so precisely they could be used as electric clocks and acontinuous-wave radio transmitter, the implications of which were lost on mostof his distinguished audience. He also exhibited a version of his Egg ofColumbus which demonstrated his theory of planetary motion. The ElectricalExperimenter said:In this experiment one large, and several small brass balls were usuallyemployed. When the field was energized all the balls would be set spinning, thelarge one remaining in the centre while the small ones revolved around it, likemoons about a planet, gradually receding until they reached the outer guard andraced along the same field.But the demonstration which most impressed the audiences was the simultaneousoperation of numerous balls, pivoted discs and other devices placed in all sortsof positions and at considerable distances from the rotating field. When thecurrents were turned on and the whole animated with motion, it presented anunforgettable spectacle. Mr Tesla had many vacuum bulbs in which small, lightmetal discs were pivotally arranged on jewels and these would spin anywhere inthe hall when the iron ring was energized.The Columbian Exposition had proved to its 28 million visitors that AC was safe.From then on, over 80 per cent of all electrical devices bought in the US workedon alternating current. Tesla’s Famous FriendsAs a result, Tesla was proclaimed ‘Our Foremost Electrician’ and hailed as the‘New Edison’. But Tesla’s health was failing again, due to overwork. Tesla’sfriend, Thomas Commerford Martin introduced him to socialites Robert andKatherine Underwood Johnson who took him under their wing. Tesla began callingthem ‘the Filipovs’ after a Serbian poem, Luka Filipov, he had translated forthem. Robert Johnson was associate editor of the prestigious Century magazinethat ran a new profile of Tesla.His regular dinners with the Johnsons, particularly those at Thanksgiving andChristmas, became the closest thing he knew to home life. He would arrive in ahansom cab, which would have to wait outside for hours to take him back to hishotel which was only a few blocks away. The Johnsons were the only people withwhom he was on first-name terms, except for the railroad-heir William ‘Willie’K. Vanderbilt (1849 – 1920) who would let Tesla use the Vanderbilt box at theMetropolitan Opera House. Apart from opera, Tesla enjoyed theatrical comedies,particularly those featuring actress Elsie Ferguson who, he said, ‘knew how todress and was the most graceful woman he had ever seen on the stage’. Gradually,he stopped going to the opera and the theatre, going to the movies instead.It was through the Johnsons that Tesla met the writer Mark Twain[chapter-29.xhtml#b92], who was an admirer. Tesla told Twain that his books hadsaved his life when he was a boy of 12, struck down with a bout of malaria.This, apparently, brought tears to the author’s eyes.Visiting Tesla’s laboratory, Twain asked whether the inventor could come up witha high-frequency electrotherapy machine that he could sell to rich widows inEurope on his next visit. Tesla said he already had a machine that would aidtheir digestion. It vibrated in sympathy with the peristaltic waves that movedfood through the gut. Enthusiastic, Twain insisted that he tried it out. Itworked – too well – and sent the great writer dashing for the lavatory.‘I think I will start with the electrotherapy machine,’ said Twain when hereturned. ‘I wouldn’t want the widows to get too healthy all in one shot.’The Johnsons also introduced Tesla to the hero of the Spanish-American War,Richmond Pearson Hobson [chapter-29.xhtml#b95], who became a life-long friend,naturalist John Muir [chapter-29.xhtml#b94], who invited him out to YosemiteValley, and writer Rudyard Kipling [chapter-29.xhtml#b93], who had come to livein Vermont. After dining with the author in 1901, Tesla wrote to Mrs Johnson:‘What is the matter with ink-spiller Kipling? He actually dared to invite me todine in an obscure hotel where I would be sure to get hair and cockroaches inthe soup.’With Twain and other notables in the laboratory, the first photographs underphosphorescent light were taken. However, despite his overwork, Tesla refused toaccept the Johnsons’ invitation to take a holiday with them at their home at theHamptons on Long Island. Fame, But No FortuneWith Tesla’s help, Thomas Martin published The Inventions, Researches andWritings of Nikola Tesla in 1894. But Tesla kept giving copies away free. BothMartin and the Johnsons were worried that Tesla made no effort to make money outof his work and suggested that he should, at least, tell the newspapers abouttaking photographs under phosphorescent light so he would get the credit.Meanwhile, Martin had to lend Tesla money from his share of the book – moneythat Tesla would never repay.The University of Nebraska offered Tesla an honorary doctorate, but this wasconsidered too trifling an accolade for the great inventor. Instead, Johnsonorganized an honorary doctorate from Columbia. One from Yale soon followed.To boost his fame, Martin arranged for Tesla to have his voice recorded on aphonograph, an honour already bestowed on the Australian opera singer NellieMelba (1861 – 1931) and Sarah Bernhardt. He also got Tesla to sit for a sculptorand do interviews with the mainstream media. Journalists flocked around. JosephPulitzer (1847 – 1911) – who later established the Pulitzer prizes but was thenpublisher of the New York World – sent a young reporter named Arthur Brisbane(1864 – 1936) to interview Tesla in one of his favourite haunts, Delmonico’sRestaurant where, for many years, he ate every night. Brisbane noted the famousrestaurateur lowered his voice at the mention of Tesla’s name. According toBrisbane, Charles Delmonico said in hushed tones:That Tesla can do anything. We managed to make him play pool one night. He hadnever played, but he had watched us for a little while. He was very indignantwhen he found that we meant to give him 15 points. But it didn’t matter much,for he beat us all even and got all the money. There are just a few of us whoplay for 25 cents, so it wasn’t the money we cared about, but the way he studiedout pool in his head, and then beat us, after we had practised for years,surprised us.Brisbane said he found that Tesla ‘stoops – most men do when they have nopeacock blood in them. He lives inside of himself. He takes a profound interestin his own work.’ However, the engraving that accompanied the article famouslyshowed Tesla erect and unbowed.When asked what it was like to subject himself to such huge voltages, Teslasaid: ‘I admit that I was somewhat alarmed when I began these experiments, butafter I understood the principles, I could proceed in an unalarmed manner.’Later he explained the spectacle presented when he was connected to an ACvoltage of two-and-a-half million volts. It was, Tesla said:…a sight marvellous and unforgettable. One sees the experimenter standing on abig sheet of fierce, blinding flame, his whole body enveloped in a mass ofphosphorescent wriggling streamers like the tentacles of an octopus. Bundles oflight stick out from his spine. As he stretches out the arms, thus forcing theelectric fluid outwardly, roaring tongues of fire leap from his fingertips.Objects in his vicinity bristle with rays, emit musical notes, glow, grow hot.He is the centre of still more curious actions, which are invisible. At eachthrob of the electric force myriads of minute projectiles are shot off from himwith such velocities as to pass through the adjoining walls. He is in turn beingviolently bombarded by the surrounding air and dust. He experiences sensationswhich are indescribable. Vow of ChastityTesla also became a close friend of society architect Stanford White, designerof Madison Square Garden, the Washington Memorial Arch and the New York HeraldBuilding. They met in 1891 when piano virtuoso Ignacy Paderewski (1860 – 1941)played at Madison Square Garden for five nights. White even put Tesla up at hisclub, The Players, which became one of the inventor’s favourite haunts. But itwas a strange friendship. While Tesla was thought to be chaste, White, thoughmarried, invited him to one of his parties where naked girls emerged from pies.White was later shot dead by Harry Thaw, the jealous husband of White’s mistressshowgirl Evelyn Nesbit.It seems from their correspondence that Katherine Johnson took some amorousinterest in Tesla. He was also seen dining out with women. However, he hadbecome interested in Buddhism and seems to have sworn a vow of chastity aftermeeting Swami Vivekananda (1863 – 1902) at a dinner with Sarah Bernhardt. Swamiwas in America for the Congress of World Religions held at the Chicago World’sFair and preached chastity as a path to enlightenment.Both Bernhardt and Vivekananda visited Tesla’s laboratory in New York. Teslaalso studied the theosophical theories of the spiritualist Madame Blavatsky(1831 – 91), now widely seen as a charlatan."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6 – Niagara Falls In the schoolroom there were a few mechanical models which interested me andturned my attention to water turbines. I constructed many of these and foundgreat pleasure in operating them. How extraordinary was my life an incident mayillustrate. My uncle had no use for this kind of pastime and more than oncerebuked me. I was fascinated by a description of Niagara Falls I had perused,and pictured in my imagination a big wheel run by the Falls. I told my unclethat I would go to America and carry out this scheme. Thirty years later I sawmy ideas carried out at Niagara and marvelled at the unfathomable mystery of themind.Nikola Tesla In 1886, civil engineer Thomas Evershed, who had worked on the Erie Canal,proposed digging a series of canals and tunnels to carry water from NiagaraFalls to waterwheels that would be used to power industrial mills and factories.Three years later, Edison drew up a plan to electrify the city of Buffalo, NY,which was 20 miles (32 km) away. However, DC had never been transmitted morethan one or two miles.Even Westinghouse, at that time, was dubious that electricity could betransmitted so far and suggested a complex system of compressed air tubes andcables to convey the power. Plans were drawn up for the construction of anindustrial complex next to the Falls, but then came the news that AC power hadbeen transmitted the 109 miles (175 km) from Lauffen to Frankfurt by AEG inGermany.The International Niagara Commission, headed by Lord Kelvin, offered $20,000 forthe best plan to harness the power of the Falls. Like Edison, Kelvin was opposedto AC – until he saw it in action at the Columbian Exposition. Then he became anenthusiastic convert. Westinghouse refused to enter at first as he felt that, towin, he would be handing over $100,000-worth of advice. Of the twenty schemessubmitted, fourteen used hydraulics or compressed air. Four involved DC power,one of which was endorsed by Edison. Two used AC. One of them was not fullyworked out; the other used the Tesla system manufactured by Westinghouse. Closing the DealGE thought they were still in the running and when blueprints went missing fromthe Westinghouse works they were accused of industrial espionage. However thesuccess of the hydroelectric plant at Telluride followed by Westinghouse’striumph at the Chicago World’s Fair left no one in doubt about who should beawarded the contract. Thomas Martin’s article on Tesla in Century closed thedeal. The following year, The New York Times wrote: ‘To Tesla belongs theundisputed honor of being the man whose work made this Niagara enterprisepossible … There could be no better evidence of the practical qualities of hisinventive genius.’Meanwhile the president of the Cataract Construction Company, Edward Dean Adams,visited Tesla in New York and offered him $100,000 for a controlling interest infourteen US and foreign patents, along with any future inventions Tesla may comeup with. Tesla accepted and in February 1895 the Nikola Tesla Company was setup. Not only was Tesla working on wireless and remote control, he was puttinghis mind to cheap refrigeration, the production of liquid air, the manufactureof fertilizers and nitric acid from the air, and artificial intelligence. Electrifying BuffaloConstruction of the first power station at Niagara took 5 years. It was aheadache for investors throughout. The outlay was huge and no one knew whetherit would work as the plans lay principally in Tesla’s three-dimensionalimagination. However their worries evaporated when the switch was thrown and thefirst power reached Buffalo at midnight on 16 November 1896. The Niagara Gazettereported: ‘The turning of a switch in the big powerhouse at Niagara completed acircuit which caused the Niagara River to flow uphill.’ The first 1,000horsepower of electricity reaching Buffalo was taken by the street railwaycompany, but already the local power company had orders from residents for 5,000more. Within a few years the number of AC generators at Niagara Falls reachedthe planned ten, and power lines ran as far as New York City. Broadway wasablaze with lights. It powered streetcars and the subway system. Even ThomasEdison’s networks converted to alternating current. Mesmerized by MarsWhile these developments were going on, Tesla was doing more experiments withwireless transmission. He set up a transmitter on the roof of his laboratory andusing an aerial strung from a balloon, he could detect a signal on top of theHotel Gerlach, thirty blocks away.As always, Tesla was a visionary. Walking up Fifth Avenue one fine Sundayafternoon in 1894, he said to his young assistant D. McFarlan Moore: ‘After wehave signalled from any point to any point on the Earth, the next step we willbe signalling other planets.’America was in the grip of Martian fever at the time. The noted astronomerPercival Lowell (1855 – 1916) was studying the ‘canals’ on Mars and John JacobAstor (1864 – 1912) – the richest man to die on the Titanic – had just publishedA Journey to Other Worlds. He gave a copy to Tesla.For the time being, Tesla was planning to see if he could receive signals from aferry on the Hudson River, but on 13 March 1895 his laboratory burnt down. WhileTesla was wrestling with depression, Westinghouse was fighting over the patentsfor Tesla’s AC induction motors against GE and others. GE, of course,promulgated the theory that the fire at Tesla’s lab had been caused by thesparks emanating from one of his motors. In fact, it had started on the floorbelow.Tesla set about finding a new lab. In the meantime, Edison let him use aworkshop in Llewellyn Park, New Jersey, and, although uninsured, Tesla wasconfident that Westinghouse would pay for any new equipment he needed. However,Westinghouse was a hard-headed businessman and billed Tesla. Meanwhile, heannounced that he was planning to use Tesla’s motors, whose patents he owned, topower locomotives.The following year, 1896, Tesla told the press that he was looking into the‘possibility of beckoning Martians’ and, when Lord Kelvin arrived in America in1897, he suggested using the lights of New York to flash a signal to theMartians. Meanwhile Edison was working on something even more outlandish – atelephone to contact the dead.But for Tesla contacting Mars was just an ‘extreme application of [my] principleof propagation of electric waves’. It was merely an extension of a more Earthlygoal. He pointed out: ‘The same principle may be employed with good effects forthe transmission of news to all parts of the Earth … Every city on the globecould be on an immense circuit … a message sent from New York would be inEngland, Africa and Australia in an instant. What a grand thing that would be.’ Electric Demon DuoArthur Brisbane in The World newspaper had announced that Tesla was ‘greatereven than Edison’, but New York’s Troy Press asked: ‘Who is electric king,Edison or Tesla?’ Meanwhile, the two men, now billed as the ‘Twin Wizards ofElectricity’, were appearing at the National Electrical Exposition inPhiladelphia. Tesla was then on the ascendant as AC had been transmitted alongtelephone lines for a record-breaking 500 miles (800 km). Tesla was disappointedthough as the power at the Exposition was restricted due to the fear of fire.By this time, Edison was conceding: ‘The most amazing thing about thisExposition is the demonstration of the ability to deliver here an electriccurrent generated at Niagara Falls. To my mind it solves one of the mostimportant questions associated with electrical development.’ Bell concurred,stating, ‘This long distance transmission of electric power was the mostimportant discovery of electric science that had been made for many years.’Tesla told the Philadelphia Press: ‘I am now convinced beyond any question thatit is possible to transmit electricity … to commercial advantage over a distanceof 500 miles at half the cost of generation by steam … I am willing to stake myreputation and my life on this declaration.’ The Power of Electrical HealingFollowing on from Mark Twain’s idea, Tesla began to experiment on the healingproperties of electricity in his new laboratory on Houston Street in GreenwichVillage. At the time, doctors were promoting electricity as a ‘vitality booster’and a ‘universal healing agent’. Some even said that it could cure tuberculosis,which was rife at the time. It was reported that Tesla took daily doses to dealwith his depression after his lab burnt down. He said that high-frequencies‘produce an anti-germicidal action’. As part of his daily routine, he wouldstrip off and climb on board his apparatus and crank up the juice.He was also said to be working on an electric weeding tool to clear railroadtracks of unwanted undergrowth. He paid a short visit to Colorado, where heclaimed to have transmitted a signal through Pike’s Peak, using the energy ofthe Earth, rather than his oscillators. Announcing the success of thisexperiment in Arthur Brisbane’s newspaper The World on 8 March 1896, he said:‘Electricity would be as free as the air. The end has come to telegraph,telephone companies, and other monopolies … with a crash.’ X-Rays, Shadowgraphs and Cosmic RaysWhile running a current through partially evacuated glass tubes, Tesla had alsonoticed a special radiation was given off that could be detected byphosphorescent and fluorescent substances. In 1892, he gave lectures on what hecalled ‘black light and very special radiation’. Experimenting with hisradiation he notice that he could produce what he called ‘Shadowgraphs’ onplates inside metal containers. Unfortunately, these were lost when hislaboratory burned down.When he read of Röntgen [chapter-29.xhtml#b96]’s discovery of X-rays, herealized that these were the same thing as his ‘very special radiation’. Heproduced more shadowgraphs and sent them to Röntgen who asked how they had beenmade.Tesla quickly realized that he could get better results with a Tesla Coil thatdeveloped 4 million volts. While others were X-raying thin structures such ashands and feet, he was taking photographs through the skull at a distance of 40ft (12 m) from the tube.While experimenting, Tesla noticed that the energy had both particle andwave-like attributes, something later recognized by Albert Einstein. He alsospeculated that the tiny lumps of matter involved, later known as electrons,might be broken up into even smaller pieces and said that ‘similar streams mustbe emitted by the Sun’ – what we now know as cosmic rays.Tesla X-rayed birds and animals, himself and his assistants, quite oblivious tothe fact that this might be dangerous. He reasoned that the amount of materialinvolved was so small that it would take centuries to build up enough to bepoisonous. He himself suffered from bad headaches when experimenting with X-raysand an assistant suffered blistering and inflammation of exposed skin.Edison was also experimenting with X-rays and noted that they caused sensationsin the eyes of the blind. He believed that eyesight might be restored by theapplication of X-rays. Tesla disagreed and there was another falling out.The rift was mended when the Kentucky School of Medicine combined devices madeby Tesla and Edison to remove birdshot from the foot of a voter who had beenshot during an election scuffle. Thomas Martin then took Tesla, Edison and otherelectricians on a fishing trip off Sandy Hook. Ironically, Tesla caught a largeflounder; Edison a huge fluke. Heading for The FallsIn July 1896, Tesla, Westinghouse, Adams and others involved in the Niagaraproject, travelled up to the Falls. On their arrival, the Niagara Gazettereported:Tesla is an idealist, and anyone who has created an ideal of him from the famethat he has won will not be disappointed in seeing him for the first time. He isfully six feet tall, very dark of complexion, nervous, and wiry. Impressionablemaidens would fall in love with him at first sight, but he has no time to thinkof impressionable maidens. In fact, he has given as his opinion that inventorsshould never marry. Day and night he is working away at some deep problems thatfascinate him, and anyone that talks with him for only a few minutes will getthe impression that science is his only mistress, and that he cares more for herthan for money and fame.Tesla was overcome at the sight of the Falls and the first of the hydroelectricpower stations designed by Stanford White built there. It would house some tengigantic Tesla turbines generating over 35,000 kilowatts.Afterwards he returned to New York City, where he threw himself back intoresearch into the wireless transmission, fearing that Marconi may steal a march.Again he refused to holiday with the Johnsons, though he did have Christmasdinner with them. Respect, Acclaim and KudosThe celebration for the inauguration of the Niagara Falls power station was heldin January 1897 in the Ellicott Club in Buffalo, NY. The top 350 of America’smost prominent businessmen made the trek there. A notable no-show was ThomasEdison.Tesla was introduced as the ‘greatest electrician on Earth’ and received astanding ovation. However, Tesla made a rambling, self-deprecating speech,saying it had been a mistake to invite him. He heaped praise on those who hadhelped. Running out of time, the master of ceremonies intervened and cut off theend of his speech. Just as well, as a blissfully unaware Tesla was about toenlighten the distinguished audience by telling them that they had wasted alltheir time and money building a power line from Niagara to Buffalo – he wouldsoon be transmitting the electricity wirelessly …His continual self-deprecation did him no favours. Others were claiming to haveinvented the induction motor and the Tesla Coil, and they were pirating hisinventions. Meanwhile he turned down several applications to be his assistantfrom a top Yale student, Lee De Forest (1873 – 1961), who eventually went on torival Marconi in the development of radio."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7 – Tesla’s Extreme Science Suppose the whole earth to be like a hollow rubber ball filled with water, andat one place I have a tube attached to this, with a plunger in the tube. If Ipress upon the plunger the water in the tube will be driven into the rubberball, and as the water is practically incompressible, every part of the surfaceof the ball will be expanded. If I withdraw the plunger, the water follows itand every part of the ball will contract. Now, if I pierce the surface of theball several times and set tubes and plungers at each place the plungers inthese will vibrate up and down in answer to every movement which I may producein the plunger of the first tube. If I were to produce an explosion in thecentre of the body of water in the ball, this would set up a series ofvibrations in the whole body. If I could then set the plunger in one of thetubes to vibrating in consonance … in a little while and with the use of a verylittle energy I could burst the whole thing asunder.Nikola Tesla, explaining a global telegraph system Back in New York, Tesla began developing Elisha Gray’s teleautography intotelephotography. Edison then announced that he planned to launch the autographictelegraph, which would allow journalists to file their stories effortlessly,along with sketches and pictures. Tesla claimed his system could also workwirelessly, at a time when sending a Morse signal still had to be perfected.Tesla had studied a system developed in 1846 by Scottish physicist AlexanderBain (1810 – 77). It transmitted pictures using a grid of wires imbedded in waxunder a sheet of chemically treated paper. The receiver used the same grid wherean electric stylus drew the shape. Tesla found that it was better to break downthe elements of the picture using one wire and a spinning disc. Dr Arthur Kornof the University of Munich, who transmitted a photograph in 1902, cited hisdebt to Tesla. These experiments were the basis of the fax machine and thetelevision. Connecting to the Earth’s EnergyFrom what he read, Tesla began to suspect that Marconi was using clones ofTesla’s equipment in his experiments. After Sir William Preece had cancelled thetest of Tesla’s equipment, Lloyds of London contacted Tesla and asked if hewould rig up a ship-to-shore system for an international yacht race in 1896.Tesla high-handedly refused, fearing that his work would be confused with theamateurish efforts of others in the field.He then began secret experiments that he did not even tell his lab assistantsabout. He would set up his transmitter in East Houston Street, then take abattery-powered receiver up the Hudson River to West Point, a distance of some50 miles. From there, he could tune in to the signal from the transmitter. Hedid this two or three times, he told a court in 1915.At the same time, he considered harnessing wind power, tidal power, solar energyand geothermal energy. Electricity could be used to electrolyze water,separating it into hydrogen and oxygen, whose explosive recombination wouldproduce heat and steam. He patented a machine to produce ozone[chapter-30.xhtml#b124] and worked out how to separate nitrogen out of airelectrically. The farmer would simply shovel earth into the machine and switchit on. The current would drive out the oxygen and hydrogen, leaving the nitrogento be absorbed in the soil which would emerge ready-fertilized.Over 4,000 people turned out to see his lecture on the advances he had made inthe field of X-rays at the New York Academy of Science, though it is thoughtthat they had hoped to see him hurling thunderbolts again. Then in an article inScribner’s Magazine on Marconi’s successful transmission of a radio signal 8miles (13 km), he outlined a system for transmitting messages instantly aroundthe world using the telluric currents that run below the surface of the Earth.He also had plans to transmit signals through the ionized layers thought toexist in the upper atmosphere.While Tesla had done all the early development in radio, Marconi was preparingto transmit a signal across the English Channel. Once again Tesla had failed toexploit his own invention. Without the money to pursue his bigger projects, hispronouncements made him sound like a mad scientist. Brown and Peck were stillearning thousands from his patents, while Westinghouse had joined forces withGE. Tesla’s induction motors and polyphase system were about to power subwaytrains without a penny going to the inventor.Tesla was further sidelined at an electrical exhibition in New York organized byStanford White. The Marconi company was represented by Edison’s son, Tom EdisonJr. Marconi had needed some wireless patents that Edison had taken out, and theWizard of Menlo Park was happy to do business. Making the Earth MoveTesla placed one of his oscillators in the central support beam in the basementof the building of his Houston Street lab and adjusted the frequency until thebeam began to hum. While he was distracted momentarily, the building began toshake, along with the earth and all the buildings around it. According to theBrooklyn Eagle: ‘The Fire Department responded to an alarm frantically turnedin; four tons of machinery flew across the basement and the only thing whichsaved the building from utter collapse was the quick action of Dr Tesla inseizing a sledgehammer and destroying his machine.’Tesla called the device a ‘Frankenstein’s monster’, and pointed out that nobuilding could stand the strokes of a 5-pound hammer, delivered at its resonantfrequency. On another occasion, Tesla claimed to have gone down to Wall Streetwhere there was a ten-storey steel frame of a building under construction,clamped an oscillator the size of an alarm-clock to it and tuned it in.In a few minutes, I could feel the beam trembling. Gradually the tremblingincreased in intensity and extended throughout the whole great mass of steel.Finally, the structure began to creak and weave, and the steel workers came tothe ground panic-stricken, believing that there had been an earthquake. Rumoursspread that the building was about to fall, and the police reserves were calledout. Before anything serious happened, I took off the vibrator, put it in mypocket, and went away. But if I had kept on 10 minutes more, I could have laidthat building flat in the street. And, with the same vibrator, I could drop theBrooklyn Bridge in less than an hour.He told reporters that he could have split the Earth the same way, destroyingmankind. He had worked out that the resonant frequency of the Earth has aperiodicity of 1 hour, 49 minutes. If he were to explode a ton of dynamite every1 hour, 49 minutes, the shock waves would keep reinforcing one another. Heestimated that it would take a year to smash the world to pieces, ‘but in a fewweeks I could set the earth’s crust into such a state of vibration that it wouldrise and fall hundreds of feet, throwing rivers out of their beds, wreckingbuildings and practically destroying civilization. The principle cannot fail.’ Researching Remote ControlIn 1898, the United States went to war with Spain after the battleship, the USSMaine, was sunk in Havana harbour. Cuba was still a Spanish colony at the time.It was thought that Tesla was on John Jacob Astor’s yacht when, to aid the wareffort, he proposed the idea of a guided torpedo.While Astor and his yacht went to war, Tesla began making preliminaryexperiments with a remote-controlled boat [chapter-30.xhtml#b123]. Tesla had alarge tank in the auditorium of the Electrical Exhibition in 1898. In it was a 4ft (1.2 m) boat. By means of transmitters working at various frequencies, hecould start and stop the boat, steer it and switch its lights on and off. He hadalso planned to build a submersible, perhaps to stage mock battles betweenSpanish ships and the American fleet. But he was upstaged by the Marconi companywho were demonstrating remotely controlled mines, detonated wirelessly. Thepress got particularly excited when Tom Edison Jr accidentally blew up his deskwhere other mines were stored. Crew-less Devil AutomataTesla’s invention seemed all the more crazy when he proposed a Torpedo BoatWithout a Crew:My submarine boat, loaded with its torpedoes, can start out from a protected bayor be dropped over a ship’s side, make its devious way below the surface,through dangerous channels of mine beds, into protected harbours and attack afleet at anchor, or go out to sea and circle about, watching for its prey, thendart upon it at a favourable moment, rush up to within a hundred feet if needbe, discharge its deadly weapon and return to the hand that sent it. Yet throughall these wonderful evolutions it will be under the absolute and instant controlof a distant human hand on a far-off headland, or on a war ship whose hull isbelow the horizon and invisible to the enemy.I am aware that this sounds almost incredible and I have refrained from makingthis invention public till I had worked out every practical detail of it. In mylaboratory I now have such a model, and my plans and description at the PatentOffice at Washington show the full specifications of it.Even the Electrical Engineer, edited by his friend Thomas Martin, complainedthat Tesla was always promising great things and failing to deliver, saying: ‘MrTesla fools himself, if he fools anybody, when he launches forth into thedazzling theories and speculations associated with his name.’He would tether up aloft balloons in those strata and deliver to them largequantities of current at such high potential that it would travel economicallyacross the space without wires, say from Niagara Falls to Paris. By this faciledistribution of water power, coal and steam would become unnecessary toindustry. The new plan may explain why Mr Tesla has abandoned his old steamoscillator. It is earnestly to be hoped that this novel idea will proveworkable. Balloons were a dismal failure in our late war, but that is nocriterion, and Mr Tesla may have some superior gas for inflation andsustentation purposes. It will be remembered that Mr Marconi has alreadytelegraphed from balloon to balloon, without wires, a distance of over 20 miles,thus proving in advance the tenability of Mr Tesla’s proposition.Perhaps Tesla was caught up in war fever but he was convinced his ‘DevilAutomata’ was the way of the future. ‘The continuous development in thisdirection must ultimately make war a mere contest of machines without men andwithout loss of life,’ he wrote, ‘a condition which would have been impossiblewithout this new departure, and which, in my opinion, must be reached aspreliminary to permanent peace.’Others agreed with him. One of them was Mark Twain who wanted to sell patents toEuropean governments. Tesla himself entered into negotiations with Czar NicholasII (1868 – 1918) of Russia. Nevertheless, some began to write him off. Thejournal Public Opinion compared his remote-control boat to the mysterious‘motive power’ of John Worrell Keely (1837 –98) who had just died, and said:‘The facts of Mr Tesla’s inventions are few and simple as the fancies which havebeen woven around it are many and extravagant. The principle of the inventionare not new, nor was Tesla the original discoverer.’ Beautiful but Incomplete InventionsTesla was upset by Thomas Martin’s attack and wrote a response that ElectricalEngineer was forced to publish. It said: ‘Being a bearer of high honours from anumber of American universities, it is my duty, in view of this slur, to exactfrom you a complete and humble apology … On this condition I will again forgiveyou, but I would advise you to limit yourself in your future attacks tostatements for which you are not liable to be punished by law.’Martin struck back, saying directly after Tesla’s letter: ‘Our foremostelectrical inventor has been kind enough to say that the Electrical Engineermade Mr Tesla.’ The implication, of course, being that Tesla was not America’sforemost electrical engineer. And it was true that between 1890 and 1898,Electrical Engineer had published 167 articles by or about Tesla. In that time,Electrical Review had published 127 and Electrical World just 97.The rebuttal was headed ‘His Friends to Mr Tesla’ and urged him to complete along list of ‘beautiful but unfinished inventions’, but he should stop makingstatements about such fantastic things as remote-control aircraft that would‘explode at will… [and] never make a miss’. The world was not ready at thatpoint in time for the cruise missile that Tesla was describing.But Martin had a point. Tesla’s oscillator was not a commercial success. Hisfluorescent tubes never went on the market. And his wireless transmission ofpower was never realized. Tesla was sanguine. He wrote later: ‘I’m glad that Iam living in a place in which, though they can roast me in the papers, theycannot burn me at the stake.’As a final shot at Martin and the Electrical Engineer, he published an articlein Electrical Review with pictures showing him, holding a glowing wirelessvacuum lamp the size of a basket ball lit by millions of volts conducted by hisbody. I, Robot …A reporter from The New York Times watching his remote control boat said hecould envision a wireless torpedo. Tesla had a bigger vision. ‘You do not seethere a wireless torpedo,’ he said, ‘you see there the first of a race ofrobots, mechanical men which will do the laborious work of the human race.’ ForTesla it was a short leap from a remote-controlled machine to one that couldthink for itself. In Century magazine in June 1900, he wrote: ‘I am an automatonendowed with power of movement, which merely responds to external stimulibeating upon my sense organs, and thinks and acts and moves accordingly. Iremember only one or two cases in all my life in which I was unable to locatethe first impression which prompted a movement or a thought, or even a dream.’Consequently, a sentient being could be manufactured.Long ago, I conceived the idea of constructing an automaton which wouldmechanically represent me, and which would respond, as I do myself, but, ofcourse, in a much more primitive manner, to external influences. Such anautomaton evidently has to have motive power, organs for locomotion, directiveorgans, and one or more sensitive organs so adapted as to be excited by externalstimuli … Whether the automaton be of flesh and bone, or of wood and steel, itmatters little, provided it can perform all the duties required of it like anintelligent being.However, people found it hard to take his ideas seriously. Tesla called hisremotely controlled boat ‘The First Telautomaton’, but the examiner-in-chief ofpatents found the concept so unbelievable that he had to come and see it forhimself. And when he thought of offering it to the government, the official inWashington he spoke to burst out laughing.During the Spanish-American war, the Secretary of the Navy also turned downTesla’s offer of wireless transmitters to help coordinate ship and troopmovements for fear of the sparks that they might give off. Tesla assured himthat he had overcome this problem, but the persistent image of Tesla withlighting bolts pouring from his fingers was too vivid. Ignited by Cosmic ForcesTesla also believed that we are shaped by cosmic forces ‘not in the vague anddelusive sense of astrology, but in the rigid and positive meaning of physicalscience’. After all, science ‘admits that the suns, planets, and moons of aconstellation are one body, and there can be no doubt that it will beexperimentally confirmed in times to come, when our means and methods forinvestigating psychical and other states and phenomena shall have been broughtto great perfection’.The spark of life was present in every inanimate object too. ‘Even matter calledinorganic, believed to be dead, responds to irritants and gives unmistakableevidence of a living principle within,’ he said. ‘Thus, everything that exists,organic or inorganic, animated or inert, is susceptible to stimulus from theoutside … What is it that causes inorganic matter to run into organic forms? …It is the Sun’s heat and light. Wherever they are there is life.’ Not Mad At AllSome people still had faith. Tesla boasted that he had produced a lamp that wasfar superior to the incandescent bulb, using one-third of the energy.As my lamps will last forever, the cost of maintenance will be minute. The costof copper, which in the old system is a most important item, is in mine reducedto a mere trifle, for I can run on a wire sufficient for one incandescent lampmore than a thousand of my own lamps, giving fully five thousand times as muchlight.On the strength of this, Tesla’s friend John Jacob Astor invested $100,000 inthe Tesla Electric Company and Tesla moved into the Waldorf-Astoria."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8 – In Colorado Springs Nikola Tesla, the Serbian scientist, whose electrical discoveries are not of onenation, but the pride of the world, has taken up his abode in Colorado Springs …On East Pike’s Peak avenue, with limitless plains stretching to the eastward,and a panorama of mighty mountains sweeping away north and south, to the west –Tesla has caused to be constructed a [wireless] station for scientific research.Desire Stanton, Colorado Springs, 1899 With Tesla’s coils now generating up to 4 million volts with sparks jumping fromthe walls to the ceilings, Tesla’s Houston Street laboratory was becoming a firehazard. Nor was it secure against the snooping of Edison’s spies. And Tesla hadexperiments that he wanted to conduct, he said, in secret.He had been out to Pike’s Peak outside Colorado Springs in 1896 at theinvitation of Westinghouse patent attorney Leonard E. Curtis. For his newexperiments, he needed huge amounts of power, but he would be working mostlylate at night when the load would be least and Curtis arranged for him to getfree power from the local utility, the El Paso Power Company.After stopping to show off his Telautomaton in Chicago, he arrived in ColoradoSprings on 18 May 1899 and immediately breached his own secrecy. When a reporterasked him what his plans were, he said: ‘I propose to send a message from Pike’sPeak to Paris, France. I see no reason why I should keep the thing a secret anylonger.’ He was welcomed with a banquet. Mining camps in the area had adoptedhis AC system, so he was already a celebrity out West.With a local carpenter named Joseph Dozier, he built an experimental station onan empty field known as Knob Hill, which had a view over Pike’s Peak to the westand rolling plains to the east. It was essentially a wooden barn measuring 60 ftby 70 ft (18 m by 21 m). It consisted of one large room with a roof that opened,two small offices at the front and a balcony.Again intent on keeping the exact nature of his experiments secret, Tesla hadthe only window that Dozier had provided, boarded up. A fence ringed the stationwith numerous signs on it saying: KEEP OUT, GREAT DANGER. Above the door was aphrase from Dante’s Inferno said to be the inscription above the entrance toHell: Abandon hope, all ye who enter here. The Magnifying TransmitterColorado Springs was 6,000 ft (1,800 m) above sea level and Tesla planned to tapinto the rarefied air 5,000 ft (1,500 m) above the Earth. He soon discoveredthat the 10 ft (3 m) helium balloons he had bought from Germany could not liftthe hundreds of feet of wire, so he devised a telescopic mast that raised acopper ball to a height of 142 ft (43 m). To steady the mast, Tesla built a 25ft (8 m) tower on the roof of his laboratory.Under it, he built a ‘magnifying transmitter’, which was essentially a hugeTesla Coil. On top of a 6 ft (1.8 m) wall, he laid two turns of thick cable.This was fed 500 volts from the end of a streetcar line that stopped just shortof Knob Hill. Current was passed though a 50-kilowatt Westinghouse transformer,stepping the voltage up to 20,000 or 40,000 volts.In the centre of the room, was a secondary coil comprising hundreds of turns offiner wire. One end was connected to a round terminal inside the laboratory orthe copper ball on top of the mast. The other end was earthed. The apparatus wascompleted by a bank of capacitors that could be discharged by a motorizedbrake-wheel, while other large coils moved in and out of the magnetic field.Tesla began experimenting with wireless telephones, reporting to Astor: ‘Thereis nothing novel about telephoning without wires to a distance of 5 or 6 miles[8 or 9 km], since this has been done often before … In this connection, I haveobtained two patents.’ Taking the Pulse of the PlanetTesla also experimented sending electrical signals through the earth. Then on 4July 1899 a huge electrical storm arrived. He recorded ‘no less than 10,000 to12,000 discharges being witnessed inside of 2 hours. The flashing was almostcontinuous and, even later in the night, when the storm had abated, some 15 to20 discharges per minute were witnessed. Some of the discharges were of awonderful brilliancy and showed often ten or twice as many branches.’He could track these discharges with his sensitive detecting equipment and henoted that they registered, periodically, even when the storm had moved out ofsight. They seemed to start and stop every half an hour. Tesla concluded thatthe lightning strikes had created electromagnetic waves in the earth’s crustwhich, reflected back on themselves, set up stationary waves. These moved pastthe receiver as the storm receded.While Marconi could send radio waves across the English Channel, Tesla believedthat by harnessing these waves ‘not only would it be practicable to sendtelegraphic messages to any distance without wires, but also to impress upon theentire globe the faint modulations of the human voice, far more still, totransmit power, in unlimited amounts, to any terrestrial distance without loss’.‘With these stupendous possibilities in sight,’ wrote Tesla, ‘I attackedvigorously the development of my magnifying transmitter, now, however, not somuch with the original intention of producing one of great power, as with theobject of learning how to construct the best one.’ Mars on the HorizonImproving his instruments, Tesla found he could detect electrical disturbances1,100 miles (1,770 km) away. The detector was a ‘coherer’ – a glass tube filledwith iron fillings – connected via a capacitor to the ground. This was placedwithin the secondary coil of the magnifying transmitter. When a signal wasapplied to the electrode, the iron fillings would align, allowing current in asecondary circuit to pass though it.Tesla connected a telephone receiver across the coherer which would beep eachtime a signal was detected. Alone in the laboratory one night, he was surprisedto hear regular beeps – first one, then two, then three.‘My first observations positively terrified me,’ said Tesla, ‘as there waspresent in them something mysterious, not to say supernatural … I felt as thoughI were present at the birth of a new knowledge or the revelation of a greatertruth.’He quickly discounted that a signal with ‘such a clear suggestion of number andorder’ could have come from disturbances in the Sun, the aurora borealis orcurrents in the Earth. They could not be entirely accidental and the thoughtflashed through his mind that they might be under intelligent control. He couldnot decipher them, but over the next year ‘the feeling was constantly growing onme that I have been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another’.At Christmas 1900, the local Red Cross Society asked him what the greatestachievement of the next hundred years would be. In his answer, he said:‘Brethren! We have a message from another world, unknown and remote. It reads:one… two… three…’In interviews, Tesla maintained only that the signals were of anextraterrestrial origin, but journalists quickly concluded they were from Mars.Thanks to Percival Lowell, everyone thought that Mars was inhabited. In his bookMars (1895), Lowell concluded that there had been a drought on Mars and theMartians had built canals to carry water from the polar ice caps.Biographer Marc Seifer concluded that Tesla had picked up signals from the testsMarconi was doing with the British and French fleets. But, at that time, thetransmitters Marconi was using would not have had the power to transmit a signalhalf way round the world. Moreover, Marconi was using the high frequenciesneeded to carry radio waves through the air, while Tesla’s equipment was tunedto the very low frequencies that he believed were transmitted better through theEarth’s crust.Another theory was advanced by Kenneth and James Corum who pointed out that Io,a moon of Jupiter, emits a signal in the 10 kHz range used by Tesla. In 1996,they built a Tesla receiver and recorded a series of bleeps like those Tesladescribed in 1899. Studying astronomical charts they also discovered that bothJupiter and Mars would have been in the night sky over Colorado in the summer of1899. What’s more, on several nights in July, the signal from Io would havebroken off just as Mars was setting. If Tesla had walked out of his lab when thebeeping stopped, he would have seen Mars disappearing over the horizon.The press began to speculate how Tesla would reply to the Martians, while othersdismissed Tesla as a man who would do anything to attract self-publicity. Wonderful White LightningTesla continued experimenting with his magnifying transmitter, boosting thevoltage until it produced streams of artificial lightning 16 ft (5 m) long whichset fire to the building more than once. Tesla was continually finding himselfclose to danger.For handling the heavy currents, I had a special switch. It was hard to pull,and I had a spring arranged so that I could just touch the handle and it wouldsnap in. I sent one of my assistants down town and was experimenting alone. Ithrew up the switch and went behind the coil to examine something. While I wasthere the switch snapped in, when suddenly the whole room was filled withstreamers, and I had no way of getting out. I tried to break through the windowbut in vain as I had no tools, and there was nothing else to do than to throwmyself on my stomach and pass under. The primary carried 500,000 volts, and Ihad to crawl through the narrow place … with the streamers going. The nitrousacid was so strong I could hardly breathe. These streamers rapidly oxidizenitrogen because of their enormous surface, which makes up for what they lack inintensity. When I came to the narrow space they closed on my back. I got awayand barely managed to open the switch when the building began to burn. I grabbeda fire extinguisher and succeeded in smothering the fire.Frightening though this experience was, Tesla was thrilled. ‘I have hadwonderful experiences here,’ he wrote, ‘among other things, I tamed a wild catand am nothing but a mass of bleeding scratches. But in the scratches, therelies a mind.’Although the famous pictures of Tesla show him surrounded by lightning, theywere not discharged during the normal running of the machine. They would havebeen a waste of energy. When the magnifying transmitter was run at night, a bluebeam would be seen rising straight up over the station into the night sky,caused by a corona of fine streamers surrounding the mast and sphere.‘At night,’ Tesla said, ‘this antenna, when I turned on to the full current, wasmarvellous sight.’ Missing the Boat with the NavyWhile in Colorado, Tesla was contacted by the US Lighthouse Board who wanted toinstall a wireless on board the Nantucket Lightship so that it could giveadvanced warning of incoming ships to New York and other east-coast ports. Teslainitially agreed to supply some experimental equipment to test on the lightship.But his relations with the Lighthouse Board quickly soured when he discoveredthat his equipment was going to be tested against Marconi’s. The LighthouseBoard then said that they would prefer ‘home to foreign talent’. Tesla wasfurious, insisting that he was the pioneer who had laid down the principles ofwireless telegraphy and was not prepared to compete with the upstart Marconi.But Marconi was arriving in New York for the America’s Cup in September 1899 andsomething must be done quickly. Tesla was adamant. He had important work to doin Colorado and would not break off unless the board put in an order for atleast 12 wireless sets. They refused. So Tesla missed an opportunity todemonstrate the effectiveness of his equipment and, when the US Navy bought itsfirst wireless equipment, it was ordered from French and German companies. Turning Up the JuiceAs Tesla continued to increase the power of his magnifying transmitter, hebecame a danger to all around him. In the article ‘Can Radio Ignite Balloons?’he said:Referring to electrical or radio wave action at a distance, I know fromexperience that if proper precautions are not taken, fires of all kinds andexplosions can be produced by wireless transmitters. In my experiments inColorado, when the plant was powerfully excited, the lightning arresters for 12miles around were bridged with continuous arcs, much stronger and morepersistent than those which ordinarily took place during an electric storm. Ihave excited loops (coil aerials) and lighted incandescent lamps at aconsiderable distance from the laboratory without even using more than 5 or 10per cent of the capacity of the transmitter. When the oscillator was excited toabout 4 million volts and an incandescent lamp was held in the hand about 50 or60 feet from the laboratory, the filament was often broken by the vibration setup, giving some idea of the magnitude of the electromotive forces generated inthe space. The accompanying illustration shows one of my experiments in which Ilighted several lamps at a distance of 100 feet [30 m] from the laboratory,purely by wireless energy. Such induced currents might easily fire a gas balloonunder the proper conditions.Arriving for work one day in mid-autumn, his assistant, Kolman Czito, foundTesla the inventor watering the ground around the metal plate he had buried nearthe lab as an earth. ‘If I could only insulate these wires with liquid oxygen,’he said, ‘I could reduce losses another magnitude.’He gave Czito a pair of rubber soled shoes and put on a pair himself. ‘All theway today, sir?’ asked Czito. ‘To the limit, my friend,’ said Tesla. ‘Nowremember, keep one hand behind your back at all times.’ This was to prevent acircuit being created between his two arms that would send a lethal currentthrough the heart.‘When I give you the signal I want you to close the switch and leave it closeduntil I give you the signal to open it,’ said Tesla. Usually, he told Czito toclose the switch for a second, no longer. Then Tesla tottered out of the lab onhis high shoes, past the testing equipment and cold lamps planted in the groundat various places, and positioned himself on a knoll about a mile away where hecould see the top of the mast. Even though insulated, sparks jumped from theground to his feet as he crunched along the path. Total Black OutIt was already evening and the lights were going on in Colorado Springs as Teslagave the signal and Czito closed the switch. There was a crackling sound fromthe coils. The room was filled with an eerie blue light. The coils and thebuilding itself sprouted needles of flames as the place filled with the smell ofozone.A low rumble built to a roar of thunder that was so strong it could be heard 15miles (24 km) away. Butterflies circled as if caught in a whirlpool and a horsehalf-a-mile away bolted. ‘I suppose the capacity of the body was sufficientlygreat to derive a rather strong current through the legs which would frightenthe animal,’ said Tesla.Streamers of lightning shrouded the mast high above the roof of the lab. Fromthe top came sparks a full 135 ft (41 m) in length. Suddenly there was silence.Below, Colorado Springs had been plunged into darkness. Tesla raced back to thelab to berate Czito ‘Why did you do that?’ he shouted. ‘I did not tell you toopen the switch. Close it again immediately.’Czito pointed to the meters on the switchboard. The wires carrying power to thelab were dead. When they phoned the power station, Tesla grabbed the phone.‘This is Nikola Tesla,’ he said. ‘You have cut off my power! You must give meback my power immediately! You must not cut off my power.’The power station worker on the other end of the phone explained that Tesla hadshort-circuited their generator and had totally wrecked the power station. Thegenerator was on fire, but fortunately the powerhouse had a second, standbygenerator which was started up soon after. Tesla insisted that he be suppliedwith current from the reserve generator as soon as it was up and running. Thiswas refused. In the future, he was told, he would be supplied by a generatoroperating independently from the one supplying the El Paso Electric Company’sother customers. The generator would be the one Tesla had just burnt out. It wasup to him to fix it.Tesla left Colorado Springs – without paying his electricity bill – convincedthat his experiments had been a success. What Happened in Colorado Springs?Tesla conducted experiments at Colorado Springs for nine months and though hekept a daily diary, it is not clear what the results of his experiments were. Hehad promised to transmit a wireless signal from Pike’s Peak to Paris. He alsoaimed to transmit electricity without wires at high altitudes where the air wasthinner and more conductive. He did succeed in lighting up the sky.He transmitted extra-low-frequency signals from the surface of the earth to theionosphere. Tesla then calculated that the resonant frequency of this area wasapproximately 8 Hz. It was not until the 1950s that this idea was takenseriously and researchers were surprised to discover that the resonant frequencyof this space was indeed around 8 Hz.He also found the earth to be ‘literally alive with electrical vibrations’ andcame to believe that lightning striking the ground set up powerful waves thatmoved from one side of the earth to the other. If the Earth was a greatconductor, Tesla thought that he could transmit unlimited amounts of powerthrough it with virtually no loss. To test this theory, he had attempted tobecome the first man to create electrical effects on the scale of lightning. Andthere were some reports that he transmitted a signal powerful enough toilluminate vacuum tubes planted in the ground several miles away. But this maybe attributed to conductive properties of the ground locally at ColoradoSprings."},{"pageContent":"PART THREE: IMPOSSIBLE IDEAS"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9 – Taking on Marconi When I sent electrical waves from my laboratory in Colorado around the world, MrMarconi was experimenting with my apparatus unsuccessfully at sea. Afterward, MrMarconi came to America to lecture on the subject, stating that it was he whosent those signals around the globe. I went to hear him, and when he learnedthat I was present he became sick, postponed the lecture, and up to the presenttime has not delivered it.Nikola Tesla Marconi was in town when Tesla returned to New York to the comfort of theWaldorf-Astoria. He paid him a visit. ‘I remember him when he was coming to measking me to explain the function of my transformer for transmission of power togreat distances,’ said Tesla. ‘Mr Marconi said, after all my explanations of theapplication of my principle, that it is impossible.’‘Time will tell, Mr Marconi,’ Tesla replied. Tesla was still trying to getinterest in his Telautomatons. He proposed a ‘dirigible wireless torpedo’ orsmall remote-controlled airships.‘I have constructed such machines, and shown them in operation on frequentoccasions,’ said Tesla. ‘They have worked perfectly and everybody who saw themwas amazed at their performance.’He went to Washington DC, where he was again rebuffed. He still hoped that theUS Navy or Coast Guard might buy his wireless transmitters, and planned to provehis system by transmitting a signal across the Atlantic. Westinghouse, thoughnow in financial difficulties, fronted the money and an agent was sent toBritain to find a suitable site for a receiving station.In 1900, Tesla filed three patents on wireless communication and reworked hisplans for a transoceanic broadcasting system. He also set to work on an articlefor Century magazine. At the time he was under the influence of the philosophersFriedrich Nietzsche (1844 – 1900) and Arthur Schopenhauer (1788 – 1860). RobertJohnson begged him not to make the article too metaphysical. Tesla took nonotice. Life on MarsAs well as his scientific interests the article covered such arcane subjects asthe evolution of the race, artificial intelligence, the possibility of futurehuman beings living without eating, inorganic life forms and life on Mars.However, the magazine decided they had no alternative but to publish it anyway.It was a sensation, among his friends, at least. However, anonymous reviews inPopular Science Monthly and Science dismissed it as ‘science and fiction’.Oblivious to criticism, Tesla followed up with an article in Collier’s magazinecalled Talking With the Planets where he discusses the possibility ofcommunicating with Martians. This brought renewed criticism, especially fromthose who had axes to grind. Meanwhile Tesla tried to get fresh funds out ofAstor. They were not forthcoming. Astor was angry with Tesla. Instead of usingthe money he had given him before to perfect his fluorescent tube, Tesla had runoff to Colorado Springs and spent it on his wireless experiments.There were other problems on the emotional front. The son of his first – and,probably, only – love Anna turned up in New York, saying he wanted to be aboxer. Tesla, a boxing fan [chapter-29.xhtml#b98], encouraged him. StanfordWhite set up a bout, but the boy was knocked down and died soon after. Tesla, itwas said, grieved for him as if he were his own son. Finding a New BackerTesla moved in high circles. In the autumn of 1900, he was invited to attend thewedding of Louisa, the daughter of Wall Street magnet J. Pierpont ‘J.P.’ Morgan(1837 – 1913) [chapter-29.xhtml#b99], along with the Astors and Teddy Roosevelt(1858 – 1919) who became US president the following year. He turned out with atop hat, white gloves and cane. Tesla always prided himself on his appearanceand claimed to be one of the best-dressed men on Fifth Avenue. At the wedding,Louisa’s younger sister Anne took a fancy to Tesla. She invited him to theThanksgiving dinner at the Morgans’ home where Tesla put on a show involvingcoloured lights, lightning and various wireless devices.Morgan was a yachtsman and commodore of the New York Yacht Club. During theAmerica’s Cup, he offered Marconi $200,000 for his American patents, includingthe ‘Ocean Rights … if ever wireless telegraphy could communicate from Englandto New York’. But the deal fell through and Morgan opened negotiations withTesla.However, when they met, Morgan was not impressed. Already mired in controversy,Tesla was boastful and, aside from his early deal with Westinghouse, he had yetto show a profit on any of his inventions. Nevertheless Morgan agreed to giveTesla $150,000 to build a transatlantic transmitter with a 90-ft (27-m) tower inreturn for 51 per cent of the company and the patents. The lighting patents thatAstor had an interest in were added to this later. Tesla took the opportunity topay Westinghouse back the money he owed him for re-equipping his laboratory andthe new venture was celebrated with a banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria. World Telegraphy CentreTesla bought a 200-acre (81-hectare) tract of land at Shoreham on Long IslandSound. It was named Wardenclyffe, after James S. Warden, the businessman whohandled the deal. The plan was to expand from there an 1800-acre (728-hectare)‘Radio City’ which Stanford White set about designing. Travelling out to thesite by train one morning, Tesla read an article in Electrical Review whereMarconi admitted using a Tesla Coil in his wireless experiments.Enraged, Tesla immediately scrapped plans to build a modest 90-ft (27-m) towerand started designing a 600-ft (183-m) edifice. When he grew tired of commutingfrom the city, Tesla would stay out on Stanford White’s estate near Shoreham.When White’s wife asked Tesla why he wandered around the garden at night, Teslareplied: ‘I never sleep.’When Morgan got wind of Tesla’s grandiose plans he fulminated. White quicklyscaled things down. Marconi’s MiracleTesla’s wireless ambitions were about to suffer another setback. Marconi hadinstalled a power transmitter with a 200-foot (60 m) mast at Poldhu in Cornwalland was sending test transmissions to Crookhaven in Ireland, 200 miles (320 km)away, while the sister station was being built on Cape Cod, MA. Both wereflattened by storms in September 1901.The Poldhu station was rebuilt, but the aerial on the other side of the Atlanticwas to be carried aloft by a kite from Signal Hill, Newfoundland. On 12 December1901, it picked up a signal – three dots, the Morse code for the letter S, fromPoldhu. The age of global communication had begun.At first no one believed it. According to Tesla, Marconi had once told him that,because of the curvature of the Earth ‘wireless communication across theAtlantic was impossible because there was a wall of water several miles highbetween the two continents, which the rays could not traverse’.On hearing the news, Otis Pond, an engineer then working for Tesla, said, ‘Looksas if Marconi got the jump on you.’ Tesla replied, ‘Marconi is a good fellow.Let him continue. He is using seventeen of my patents.’Thomas Martin was doubtful about Marconi’s achievement, but after consultingwith colleagues, he booked a banqueting hall in the Waldorf-Astoria for 13January 1902 and invited 300 guests to celebrate Marconi’s achievement. Tesladid not attend, having ducked out of the hotel before Marconi arrived. Thedinner exacerbated the ill-will between Martin and Tesla, who was now preparinga new edition of The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla, thistime without Martin’s name on it.According to The New York Times at the dinner: There were cheers when thetoastmaster came to a letter from Nikola Tesla, who said he felt that ‘he couldnot rise to the occasion’. The letter went on:I regret not being able to contribute to the pleasure of the evening, but I wishto join the members in heartily congratulating Mr Marconi on his brilliantresults. He is a splendid worker, full of rare and subtle energies. May he proveto be one of those whose powers increase and whose mind feelers reach outfarther with advancing years for the good of the world and honour of hiscountry.In his speech, Marconi pointed out that his wireless was already installed onover 70 ships – 37 in the British Royal Navy, 12 in the Italian Navy and therest on liners belonging to Cunard, North German Lloyd and others. There werealready 20 stations in operation on land in Great Britain and more inconstruction. He concluded by saying: ‘I have built very largely on the work ofothers … I may miss a few of them, but I would like to mention Clerk Maxwell,Lord Kelvin, Professor Henry and Professor Hertz.’There was no mention of Tesla, but he was not cowed. He wrote to Morgan sayingthat he had developed a machine that would produce ‘an electrical disturbance ofsufficient intensity to be perceptible over the whole of the Earth … when Ithrow a switch, I shall send a greeting to the whole world and for this greattriumph I shall ever be grateful to you.’Not only would he take on the telegraph companies, but he threatened to destroynewspapers. Every customer of Tesla’s wireless system would be able to printtheir own. However, Tesla was already running out of money and this would be hislast communication with Morgan for 9 months. The Wardenclyffe TowerThough Tesla’s experimental station was impressive, it was not as grand as hehad planned. Morgan had only given him $150,000 when a more realistic sum wouldhave been $1 million. The tower rose just 187 ft (57 m) in the air. On the topwas a 57-ton steel sphere. Under the tower was a shaft that plunged 120 ft (36m) into the ground. Sixteen iron pipes were driven down another 300 ft (91 m) sothat currents could pass deep into the Earth. ‘In this system that I haveinvented,’ Tesla said, ‘it is necessary for the machine to get a grip of theEarth, otherwise it cannot shake the Earth. It has to have a grip ... so thatthe whole of this globe can quiver.’While Marconi was sending his messages through curved air, said the PortJefferson Echo, Tesla proposed to send them through the Earth as well. Butconstruction was already grinding to a halt when Marconi sent his transatlanticsignal. He may have been using Tesla’s patents, but his equipment wasinexpensive by comparison. Then the stock market crashed and the cost ofmaterials Tesla needed to complete Wardenclyffe doubled. Morgan would not stumpup any more money, so Tesla went back to the manufacture of his oscillators thathad proved so popular among his rivals, and to perfecting fluorescent lights.Money began to trickle in and he completed the cupola crowning the tower atWardenclyffe.At the end of July 1903, Tesla finally cranked up his magnifying transformer.The mushroom-shaped cupola became fully charged. Local villagers heard therumble of thunder and a strange light appeared above Tesla’s tower. This couldbe seen on the shores of Connecticut on the other side of Long Island Sound.Soon after, creditors from Westinghouse came to cart away the heavy equipmentand Tesla’s tower fell silent. Unbowed, Tesla raised money from his uncles inthe Balkans, then did the rounds of Wall Street financiers. In October 1903,Thomas Fortune Ryan (1851 – 1928) promised $100,000, but Morgan scuttled theventure. It seems that Tesla’s boast of being able to transmit unlimited amountsof power over any distance was seen as a threat to the moguls of Wall Street.How were they going to charge for the electricity it generated? Tesla clearlyintended to give power away for free. Even distributing information freely was achallenge to those who controlled major corporations. Tesla responded with anarticle published simultaneously in Electrical World and Scientific American:The results attained by me have made my scheme of intelligence transmission, forwhich the name of ‘World Telegraphy’ has been suggested, easily realizable. Itconstitutes a radical and fruitful departure from what has been done heretofore… It involves the employment of a number of plants, all of which are capable oftransmitting individualized signals to the uttermost confines of the earth. Eachof them will be preferably located near some important centre of civilizationand the news it receives through any channel will be flashed to all points ofthe globe. A cheap and simple device, which might be carried in one’s pocket,may then be set up somewhere on sea or land, and it will record the world’s newsor such special messages as may be intended for it. Thus the entire earth willbe converted into a huge brain, as it were, capable of response in every one ofits parts. Since a single plant of but one hundred horsepower can operatehundreds of millions of instruments, the system will have a virtually infiniteworking capacity, and it must needs immensely facilitate and cheapen thetransmission of intelligence. The first of these central plants would have beenalready completed had it not been for unforeseen delays…He said elsewhere that, if only Morgan would fund it, he would bring about worldpeace. But Morgan was adamant and Tesla sought refuge in Wardenclyffe, onlyventuring out to attend the funeral of Stanford White which, due to thescandalous circumstances, was shunned by most other New York socialites. More Rivals EmergeMarconi was not Tesla’s only rival. Lee De Forest [chapter-29.xhtml#b100] hadnow completed his doctorate in electrical engineering at Yale. In 1901, he sentwireless messages across the Hudson River. He speeded up transmission to 30words a minute, which was about as fast as a Morse-code operator could sendthem. By 1904, he could send a signal from Buffalo to Cleveland, a distance of180 miles (290 km). Then in 1908, he succeeded in bridging the Atlantic.While Marconi and De Forest concentrated on sending messages in Morse code,sending brief bursts of signals, Canadian-born Reginald Fessenden[chapter-29.xhtml#b101] realized that it was possible to modulate a continuoussignal to follow the irregularities of sound. At the receiving station, it wouldthen be possible to unscramble the signal and reconvert it to sound. This iswhat we now know as AM (amplitude modulated) radio. In 1906, he transmittedmusic down the Massachusetts coast. In 1910, De Forest was broadcasting thevoice of Italian opera singer Enrico Caruso (1873 – 1921) from the MetropolitanOpera House in New York. However, Tesla sued him for infringing his patents andwon. The Million-Dollar FollyThe newspapers began to call Wardenclyffe Tesla’s Million-Dollar Folly. Forcedto close it down, Tesla had a nervous breakdown. He railed against the critics:It is not a dream. It is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering,only expensive – blind, faint-hearted, doubting world … Humanity is not yetsufficiently advanced to be willingly led by the discoverer’s keen searchingsense. But who knows? Perhaps it is better in this present world of ours that arevolutionary idea or invention instead of being helped and patted, be hamperedand ill-treated in its adolescence – by want of means, by selfish interest,pedantry, stupidity and ignorance; that it be attacked and stifled; that it passthrough bitter trials and tribulations, through the heartless strife ofcommercial existence. So do we get our light. So all that was great in the pastwas ridiculed, condemned, combated, suppressed – only to emerge all the morepowerfully, all the more triumphantly from the struggle.Tesla retreated to his room at the Waldorf-Astoria where he nursed an injuredpigeon he had found near the New York Public Library. However, at night, hesometimes stole out to Wardenclyffe to hook himself up to the high-frequencymachinery. ‘I have passed 150,000 volts through my head,’ he told The New YorkTimes, ‘and did not lose consciousness, but I invariably fell into a lethargicsleep sometime after.’ He found the electricity soothing. Seeing into the FutureAlthough Wardenclyffe did not live up to his expectations, Tesla’s visionremained intact. In ‘The Future of the Wireless Art’ in Wireless Telegraphy andTelephony in 1908 he said:As soon as it is completed, it will be possible for a business man in New Yorkto dictate instructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office inLondon or elsewhere. He will be able to call up, from his desk, and talk to anytelephone subscriber on the globe, without any change whatever in the existingequipment. An inexpensive instrument, not bigger than a watch, will enable itsbearer to hear anywhere, on sea or land, music or song, the speech of apolitical leader, the address of an eminent man of science, or the sermon of aneloquent clergyman, delivered in some other place, however distant. In the samemanner any picture, character, drawing, or print can be transferred from one toanother place. Millions of such instruments can be operated from but one plantof this kind. More important than all of this, however, will be the transmissionof power, without wires, which will be shown on a scale large enough to carryconviction."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 10 – Fresh Dreams of Flying On my slow return to the normal state of mind, I experienced an exquisitelypainful longing after something undefinable. During the day I worked as usualand this feeling, though it persisted, was much less pronounced, but when Iretired, the night, with its monstrous amplifications, made the suffering veryacute … my torture was due to a consuming desire to see my mother.Nikola Tesla Slowly Tesla recovered. He would go out during the day, as dapper as ever, tohave warm compresses applied to his face and his scalp massaged. He looked fornew offices and delighted on travelling on the subway which was powered by hisinduction motors.In May 1907, Tesla was inducted into the New York Academy of Sciences. Hemanaged to borrow some money and raise a few mortgages, including one withGeorge C. Boldt, the proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria, where he had not paidrent for 3 years. Just as he seemed to be getting back on his feet came the‘Panic of 1907’, when shares plunged 50 per cent from the peak the previousyear, causing a run on the banks.Nevertheless, his imagination was as good as ever. The Wright brothers had madetheir first powered flight in 1903. Astor was also keen on flying machines andencouraged Tesla to take an interest. However, at a dinner at theWaldorf-Astoria at the beginning of 1908, he made another of his pronouncements:The coming year will dispel another error which has greatly retarded theprogress of aerial navigation. The aeronaut will soon satisfy himself that anairplane … is altogether too heavy to soar, and that such a machine, while ithas its uses, can never fly as fast as a dirigible balloon. Once this is fullyrecognized the expert will concentrate his efforts on the latter type, andbefore many months are passed it will be a familiar object in the sky.However, he was not entirely wrong as he went on to say: ‘Aerial vessels of warwill be used to the exclusion of ships.’ He also said ‘the propeller is doomed’.It would, he said, have to be replaced by ‘a reactive jet’. Tesla’s Flying MachineDespite his gloomy prognostication, Tesla revealed in The New York Times of 8June 1908 that he was working on a heavier-than-air machine of his own. By 1911,Tesla was ready to spell out his vision in a press interview:The flying machine of the future – my flying machine – will be heavier than air,but it will not be an airplane. It will have no wings. It will be substantial,solid, stable. You cannot have a stable airplane. The gyroscope can never besuccessfully applied to the airplane, for it would give a stability that wouldresult in the machine being torn to pieces by the wind, just as the unprotectedairplane on the ground is torn to pieces by a high wind.My flying machine will have neither wings nor propellers. You might see it onthe ground and you would never guess that it was a flying machine. Yet it willbe able to move at will through the air in any direction with perfect safety,higher speeds than have yet been reached, regardless of weather and oblivious ofholes in the air or downward currents. It will ascend in such currents ifdesired. It can remain absolutely stationary in the air, even in a wind, forgreat length of time. Its lifting power will not depend upon any such delicatedevices as the bird has to employ, but upon positive mechanical action.Tesla could not bear being left behind. In 1911, he said: ‘20 years ago Ibelieved that I would be the first man to fly; that I was on the track ofaccomplishing what no one else was anywhere near reaching. I was workingentirely in electricity then and did not realize that the gasoline engine wasapproaching a perfection that was going to make the aeroplane feasible.’His idea, naturally, was to have a plane powered by electricity, with powersupplied by stations on the ground. ‘I have not accomplished this as yet, but amconfident that I will in time,’ he said. The Flivver Plane Takes OffTesla applied for a patent on a flying machine in 1921. Dubbed the ‘flivverplane’ – flivver was early 20th-century slang for a cheap car – it was said tocombine the qualities of a helicopter and a plane, and could fly vertically aswell as horizontally. According to a press report:It is a tiny combination plane which, its inventor asserts, will rise anddescend vertically and fly horizontally at great speed, much faster than thespeed of the planes of today. But despite the feats which he credits to hisinvention, Tesla says that it will sell for something less than $1,000.The helicopter-airplane is a small structure, with two wings about 8 ft square.It may have one propeller and it may have several, to be driven by a light butpowerful turbine motor of Tesla’s invention. When the plane rests on the groundthe propeller will be overhead and the wings will be standing vertically. Themotor is expected to generate a terrific power that will lift the plane into theair. This power can be sustained only a short while.At the desired height, the aviator begins to tilt his plane. The wings graduallyare brought into a horizontal position that puts the propeller in front of themachine. During this operation the engine power is decreased, and, at this lowerpower, the helicopter becomes an airplane and is operated as such. The wings noware supporting surfaces, and, except when exceptional speed is wanted for a fewmoments, the engine will be run at a low rate.Seats for the pilot and three or four passengers are suspended from trunnions onwhich they can turn through an angle of 90 degrees. This enables those in theplane to sit in a normal position at all times. With two wheel bases at rightangles, the helicopter-airplane is able to descend in a glide or vertically,landing easily either way. As a helicopter, it has a low landing velocity.Although he obtained more patents for The Flivver Plane in 1928, even by then,he still had not built a full-scale model. Becoming Yesterday’s NewsBy 1909, Lee De Forest had perfected the radio-telephone which had been adoptedby the navies of Britain, the US and Italy. He had cut out the spark andminimized the chances of the interruption of messages. By transmitting thespeaking voice, he claimed, information could now be passed at a rate of 40,000words an hour instead of 40 words a minute, which was the speed of the fastestMorse operator. Tesla was rapidly becoming a footnote in the history ofwireless.Radio-telephones were being set up on top of tall buildings and, to add insultto injury, radio towers were erected on top of the Waldorf-Astoria. While Teslatook night-time rambles to Grand Central Station which would soon boast itsastronomical ceiling, Professor William Pickering announced that he had raised$10,000 to erect a set of mirrors in Texas to send signals to Mars. Advanced Bladeless TurbinesConsidering his own experiments with wireless transmission ‘evidently far inadvance of the times’, Tesla moved on to other inventions. He came up with a‘bladeless turbine’ which, he believed, would replace the petrol engine in a caror could be used to power aircraft, ships or torpedoes. It also worked as apump.Just as a rotating magnetic field dragged the rotor around in his AC motors,Tesla believed that it was possible to use steam or compressed air to turn aseries of discs attached to a turbine. They utilized the property of viscosity[chapter-28.xhtml#b79] – that is, a fluid’s resistance to flow. By adjusting thedistance between the discs to match the viscosity and speed of flow of thefluid, Tesla believed that he could create an efficient engine.In Tesla’s engine, fluid entered at the edge of the disc and exited at the shaftin the centre. As the fluid spiralled down between the discs, it dragged themaround with it. When the action was reversed, the fluid spiralled out from thecentre and acted as a pump or a blower.Without blades, the engine would be cheaper to build and easier to maintain.What’s more it gave a vastly improved power to weight ratio. Tesla claimed that,while the lightest aeroplane engine produces one horsepower (746 watts) for each2.5 pounds (1.1 kilograms), his engine would produce 25 horsepower (18,642watts). In his own mind, he had solved the problem of flying.‘I have accomplished what mechanical engineers have been dreaming about eversince the invention of steam power,’ said Tesla. ‘That is the perfect rotaryengine.’That was all very well in theory, but it had taken Tesla years to go from theidea of a rotating magnetic field to the production of a functioning AC motor.Producing a bladeless turbine similarly required a great deal of meticulousengineering. All sorts of different materials and configurations would have tobe tested. Nevertheless Tesla was confident that his new engine would be sosuccessful that he would have the money to reopen Wardenclyffe. Coming Up with the PrototypesIn 1906, Julius Czito, son of Tesla’s long-serving assistant Kolman, built thefirst prototype. It had eight discs each 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter. Weighingless than 10 pounds (4.5 kg) it developed 30 horsepower and would rotate at upto 35,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). At this speed, the metal disks began todistort. Nevertheless, in 1909, Tesla filed two patents – one for the turbine,the other for the pump.The following year, Czito produced a second prototype with 12 inch (30 cm)discs. With the speed limited to 10,000 rpm, it developed 100 horsepower. Athird prototype was slightly smaller. Its discs were 9.75 inches (24.8 cm) indiameter. The speed was limited to 9,000 rpm, but it developed 110 horsepower.Tesla proclaimed that he had invented ‘a powerhouse in a hat’. Hooked up to aninduction motor it could have made a jet engine.As he shuttled between various workshops in New York, Providence, Rhode Island,and Bridgeport, Connecticut – where most of the development was done – he becameincreasingly optimistic.‘I am now at work on new ideas of an automobile, locomotive and lathe in whichthese inventions of mine are embodied and which cannot help [but] prove acolossal success,’ he said. ‘The only trouble is to get the cash, but it cannotlast very long before my money will come in a torrent.’ Later he wrote,undaunted: ‘Things are developing very favourably, and it seems my wirelessdream will be realized before next summer.’There is speculation that Tesla installed one of his engines on a ‘mysteriouscraft’ that Astor had moored on the Harlem River. ‘It seemed to embody anairship with a practical water craft,’ said The New York Times. However, after ayear, it disappeared. Putting on a Public ShowAstor refused to invest, so Tesla set up the Tesla Propulsion Company withJoseph Hoadley, whose Alabama Consolidated Coal and Iron company planned to usethe Tesla pump as a blower in its blast furnaces. Certain his fortunes were onthe up again, Tesla took offices in the new Metropolitan Life Tower on MadisonSquare, then the tallest building in the world.Eager to promote his new invention, Tesla arranged to give a publicdemonstration at the Waterside Station of the New York Edison Company. Tesla hadtwo engines built with 18-inch (46-cm) rotors. They were just 3 ft (90 cm) long,2 ft (60 cm) wide and 2 ft (60 cm) high, and weighed 400 pounds (181 kg).Revolving at 9,000 rpm, they each developed 200 horsepower.In the demonstration, the two turbines were connected by a torque rod. Turningin the opposite direction, the two motors would engage in a tug-of-war, with thepower they developed registered on the torque rod. But in this configuration,with the two turbines pushing against one another, the motors did not actuallyturn, just strained against each other. The audience was not impressed and thestory soon circulated that the test was a complete failure. Building Up High HopesTo Tesla, though, the test had been a success. He told the New York HeraldTribune: ‘One such pump now in operation, with eight discs, 18 inches indiameter, pumps 4,000 gallons a minute to a height of 360 feet.’As a motor, they would be run using water, air, steam, gas or any other fluidunder pressure. ‘The motor is especially adapted to automobiles, for it will runon gas explosions as well as on steam,’ said Tesla. ‘Coupling these engines inseries, one can do away with gearing in machinery. Factories can be equippedwithout shafting.’ The applications were limitless.‘With a thousand horse-power engine, weighing only 100 pounds, imagine thepossibilities in automobiles, locomotives and steamships,’ he said. ‘In thespace now occupied by the engines of the Lusitania 25 times her 80,000 horsepower could be developed, were it possible to provide boiler capacity sufficientto furnish the necessary steam.’The engine would also be perfect to power Tesla’s flying machine. Using thecurrent reciprocating petrol engine, he said, ‘the aeroplane is fatallydefective. It is merely a toy, a sporting plaything. It can never becomecommercially practical.’The problem was, of course, he needed money to develop it. Westinghouse was outof business; Astor was not interested. Then in 1912, Astor was lost on theTitanic. The following year J.P. Morgan also died. After his funeral, Teslaapproached his son Jack for funding. Tesla was still hoping to get Wardenclyffeup and running again, but Jack showed no interest. However, he loaned theinventor $20,000 to develop his turbine.Tesla then moved into the Woolworth Building, which had taken over from theMetropolitan Life Tower as the world’s tallest building. On the wall of hisoffice there, Tesla had the famous picture of him in his lab at Colorado Springsquietly reading while huge streaks of artificial lightning crack over his head.The picture is, of course, a cheat, taken using time-lapse photography.Tesla then tried to sell his turbine to Sigmund Bergmann (1851 – 1927), an oldcolleague of Edison’s who had set up a large manufacturing concern in Germany.But the deal was not concluded before the start of World War I, when Jack Morganbecame involved in helping Britain and France to finance the war and lostinterest. Marconi versus TeslaTesla was bitter when Marconi won the Nobel Prize in 1909 for what Teslaconsidered was his invention. Jack Hammond [chapter-29.xhtml#b97] tried tobalance the two men’s contributions in his article ‘The Future of Wireless’ inthe National Press Reporter in 1912:Mr Tesla in 1892 showed that the true Hertzian effect was not a means by whichit was possible for a sending station to communicate with a receiving station atany great distance. He demonstrated furthermore, that waves propagated at atransmitting station travelled along the ground as a conductor. Today it isacknowledged that these views are correct. It was, however, left to the splendidenterprise of Marconi to crystallize the results of previous investigators intoa complete and practical system of space telegraphy … In 1897, Mr Marconitransmitted messages to a distance of 8.7 miles. Today Mr Marconi says that themaximum effective distance of transmission is 6,000 miles. Remote Control Mechanical DogA disgruntled Tesla resented that any credit should go to Marconi. He also heardthat, while working with Alexander Graham Bell and Tesla’s former assistantFritz Lowenstein [chapter-29.xhtml#b102], Hammond had invented a mechanical dogthat worked by remote control. While Hammond assured Tesla that he had notinfringed any of his patents, Tesla insisted that he get a share in any profits.The two of them formed the Tesla-Hammond Wireless Company funded by Hammond’sfather. Tesla saw this new company as a way to market his bladeless turbine,perhaps to the military. But Hammond was more interested in Tesla’s patents onselective tuning, which divided up the radio spectrum into numerous channels – acrucial development in radio.Hammond contacted the War Department with the proposal for a ship-to-shorecommunication system and hired Fritz Lowenstein and Benjamin Franklin Miessner[chapter-29.xhtml#b103] to form a military research group at the family estatein Gloucester, Massachusetts. Again Tesla was sidelined. Sending Messages through the AirWhile practical work was underway in Gloucester, Tesla was making moreoutrageous claims to the convention of the National Electric Light Associationin 1911. He said that he would be able to run the streetcars in Dublin by apower station in Long Island City. His wireless transmitter would generateenough power to light the entire United States.‘The current would pass into the air and, spreading in all directions, producedan effect of a strong aurora borealis,’ he said. ‘It would be a soft light, butsufficient to distinguish objects.’ The New York Times said: ‘Queen Isabella ofSpain could not have been more amazed when meeting Christopher Columbus to hearabout the new world.’Tesla was even prepared to take on Euclid:I have annihilated distance with my scheme and when perfected it will not be onemite different than my present plans call for. The air will be my medium, and Iwill be able to transmit energy of any amount to any place in the world. I willalso be able to send messages to all parts of the world, and I will send wordsout into the world, which will come out of the ground in the Sahara Desert withsuch force that they can be heard for 15 miles around.I also hope to set up a central wireless telephone station whereby there will bea force of a million horsepower behind each word uttered into my instrument, andin which distance will play no hindrances whatever. Many hundreds of people willbe able to talk at the same time and without any interference with each other.He also said that he had perfected a new steam engine, a turbine that wouldproduce 10 horsepower but weighed only one pound. The machine would be ‘thesmallest thing ever seen on wheels and will be more powerful than any automobileengine ever manufactured’. Ending the Hammond PartnershipTesla made overtures to the Japanese, hoping that they would take 500 of histurbines to power their torpedoes. He also had meetings with GE and theSeiberling Company, who developed high-speed power boats. Then he worked onprototype car engines, approaching Ford. Kaiser Wilhelm II also took an interestin possible military applications. But Tesla was having problems with thedesign. The ball bearings wore down too quickly.As Tesla preferred to work during the night, labour costs soared. Though he didnot take a salary himself, in just a few months he found he had laid out $18,000and asked Hammond for another $10,000 to keep going. But Hammond and Lowensteinwere busy installing wireless equipment on naval vessels and competing with DeForest for a $50,000 amplifier deal with AT&T. So Hammond’s main interest nowwas perfecting wireless and he ignored Tesla’s request. By then it was clearthat it would take a great deal more than $10,000 to perfect the turbine. Thiseffectively ended their partnership.Hammond spent the money he saved developing remote control, spending around$750,000 dollars on crewless ships, aircraft and submarines. He was eventuallycompensated by the War Department and did a separate deal with the RadioCorporation of America – later RCA – shortly after Tesla’s wireless patents hadrun out. Yet again the inventor had failed to profit from his inventions.However, they had made Hammond a millionaire in his own right. He used the moneyto build a faux medieval castle less than a mile from his parents’ house. Itboasted a nude statue of the famous inventor. Is It Electrified?Tesla was never idle for long. An experiment with his Tesla Coils in Sweden haddemonstrated that children in an electrified environment grew more quickly andscored higher in aptitude tests. So Tesla went to work for the superintendent ofNew York’s public schools installing Tesla Coils in the walls of a school for apilot study. The guinea pigs were 50 backward pupils and it was said that ‘thebrains of the children will receive artificial stimulation to such an extentthat they will be transformed from dunces into star pupils’.For Tesla, there would be limitless applications. The New York Times reported:According to the inventor this experiment in schools will be merely an openingwedge, a suggestion to the people that by the use of high potential electricitythey may do away with the use of bromides, phosphates, pepsin tablets, and allkinds of drugs taken for disorders of the nervous and digestive system. If hisdream comes true, 10 years from now people will inquire when renting anapartment or a house, ‘Is it electrified?’ Everyone will have at least one roomin his house furnished with a coil generating high-frequency currents. By thattime the appliance will be inexpensive, so that at a moderate cost people willbe able to obtain superb health and mental brilliancy. Ordinary conversationwill then be carried on in scintillating epigrams, and the mental life of theaverage adult will be so quickened as to equal the brain activity of the mostbrilliant people living before the time when a generator of high-frequencycurrents was a household essential. Everyone Wants to be TeslaTesla also told the newspaper that one of his assistants had been exceedinglystupid, but after a time working around high-voltage equipment the man grewbrighter and worked better. Asked about any harmful side-effects, Tesla saidthat the rays of light issuing from ordinary household incandescent lamps weremore harmful than those from a high-voltage coil. He also maintained that theincreased prevalence of baldness was due to the effect on the scalp of rays fromincandescent bulbs. But the electromagnetic radiation from his coils was, heinsisted, perfectly safe. Constant Legal BattlesWhen the Titanic sank, Marconi was credited with saving the lives of the 710survivors, as it was his equipment that had summoned the rescue ships. This wasgalling for Tesla and other pioneers. So Tesla began suing Marconi for patentinfringement. In Britain, Tesla already had let a vital patent lapse. However,Sir Oliver Lodge [chapter-29.xhtml#b104], the inventor of the coherer, won asuit against Marconi. In France, Tesla succeeded in challenging two of Marconi’spatents.Tesla was sued himself, first by an investor who failed to reap the riches hewas promised, then by Westinghouse over equipment they had lent him. Teslaargued that he was not personally liable for this, but agreed to return theequipment. Though his losses were small, he was deeply in debt and the badpublicity damaged his reputation. It seemed he was now fair game. A MrsTierstein wanted to shoot him for ‘throwing electricity at her’. She wasconfined to an asylum.While Telefunken in Germany infringed Tesla’s patents, it was too important tosue. But, when the company came to America to set up transatlantic stations atTuckerton, New Jersey, and Sayville, New York, its founder Adolf Slaby (1849 –1913), sought out Tesla in the hope that they could present a united front toMarconi. However, in 1914, Tesla was also approached by the American Marconicompany. But they only offered stock; Tesla needed cash. He appealed to JackMorgan for help, saying the US government had already installed$10-million-worth of his equipment and he was expecting to receive compensation.Meanwhile Telefunken was suing Marconi who, in turn, was suing Lowenstein andthe US Navy. However, as the wireless equipment Hammond supplied the WarDepartment was being used to test guided missiles, it was classified, so Hammondwas immune from litigation. World War IWith the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the British cut Germany’stransatlantic cables. Consequently, the Telefunken stations at Tuckerton andSayville became of vital importance. Fearing that they may be used to direct themovements of battleships and submarines, the British wanted them shut down.While ostensibly neutral, President Woodrow Wilson (1856 – 1924) signed a billprohibiting radio stations from sending or receiving messages of an ‘unneutralnature’ and took over the station at Tuckerton.Although one-tenth of the population of the United States was of German origin,most Americans backed Britain and Tesla’s connections with Telefunken made himunpopular. Indeed, he was receiving royalties from their subsidiary, theAtlantic Communication Company, and was giving them advice on how to boost theoutput of their station at Sayville, which was on Long Island just a few milesfrom Wardenclyffe. On 23 April 1915, The New York Times reported that its powerhad been increased from 35 kilowatts to 100 kilowatts and that two 500 ft (150m) towers were about to be erected, transforming it into one of the mostpowerful transatlantic communication stations. In a test transmission theprevious year, The New York Times had received a message from the Burgomaster ofBerlin. Tesla’s Day in CourtMarconi won its case against Lowenstein, but lost its suit against the US Navy.In preparation for the case, the Assistant Secretary for the Navy – laterpresident – Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882 – 1945) reviewed Tesla’s 1899 file atthe Lighthouse Board. In it was the letter asking Tesla whether he could supplywireless telegraphy apparatus. A review of Marconi’s patents was also made.In 1900, the commissioner of patents John Seymour – who had already upheldTesla’s patents against Michael Pupin’s claim that he had invented the AC system– had rejected Marconi’s first patent application because of the prior claims ofTesla, Lodge and Ferdinand Braun [chapter-29.xhtml#b106], who had shared theNobel Prize for physics with Marconi in 1909. In 1903, the patent office wrote:‘…Marconi’s pretended ignorance of the nature of a Tesla oscillator being littleshort of absurd... the term Tesla oscillator has become a household word on bothcontinents’ – that is, Europe and North America.In 1904, after Seymour had retired, Marconi had been granted a patent. This wasbeing contested in Telefunken’s suit against Marconi now going to trial. TheBrooklyn Eagle reported that some of the world’s greatest inventors were on handto testify – not least Marconi himself. He arrived in New York on the Lusitaniain April 1915, telling reporters that he had seen the periscope of a Germansubmarine on the crossing. The press were on his side as Italy sided with theAllies in World War I.Also appearing for the defence was Tesla’s old adversary, Columbia ProfessorMichael Pupin [chapter-29.xhtml#b105], who shocked the court by saying: ‘Iinvented wireless before Marconi or Tesla and it was I who gave it unreservedlyto those who followed!’A local newspaper reported that Tesla was so shocked that ‘watching his fellowSerb upon the stand, Tesla’s jaw dropped so hard, it almost cracked upon thefloor’.Pupin had already made it clear where he stood. In the press he said of Marconi:‘His genius gave the idea to the world, and he taught the world how to build atelegraphic practice upon the basis of this idea … In my opinion, the firstclaim for wireless telegraphy belongs to Mr Marconi absolutely, and to nobodyelse.’ Tesla the TrailblazerWhile Pupin could only assert that Marconi was the inventor, Tesla came armedwith lectures, articles and patents. While Marconi had only been granted hisfirst US patent in 1904, Tesla had given a practical demonstration of wirelessin St Louis, Missouri in 1893. He had transmitted a signal from his HoustonStreet laboratory to West Point before 1897. People who visited his lab saw theequipment. He then compared the Marconi patent to his own, saying: ‘If you takethese two contemporaneous diagrams, and examine the subsequent developments, youwill find that absolutely not a vestige of that apparatus of Marconi remains,and that in all the present system there is nothing but my four-tuned circuits.Everybody is using them.’Following Tesla to the stand was John Stone Stone [chapter-29.xhtml#b107], whocould himself claim to be the inventor of the radio. He filed a crucial patenton tuning 2 years before Marconi, and he acknowledged that it was Tesla, notMarconi, who was a trailblazer.Due to World War I, the legal battle was abandoned before the case was decided.Fearing a German attack, Marconi did not return to Europe on the Lusitania.Instead under a false name and in heavy disguised, he set sail on the St Paul.On 7 May 1915, the Lusitania was sunk by a German submarine with the loss of1,134 lives, including 128 US citizens. America was outraged. It was alreadysuspected that the Telefunken radio station was passing coded messages tosubmarines. Two weeks later The New York Times reported that the Germans haddeveloped ‘air torpedoes’ which were dropped from zeppelins and controlled bywireless – the very thing Tesla had claimed to have invented.When the US joined World War I in 1917, the former head of the Tuckerton stationwas arrested for spying and the Sayville station was taken over by thegovernment. Tesla’s monthly royalty cheques from Telefunken stopped. Edison,Fessenden, Pupin, Thomson and others got jobs as advisors to the government, butTesla – possibly because of the connections with Telefunken – was left out."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 11 – The Nobel Prize I have concluded that the honour has been conferred upon me in acknowledgementof a discovery announced a short time ago which concerns the transmission ofelectrical energy without wires. This discovery means that electrical effects ofunlimited intensity and power can be produced, so that not only can energy betransmitted for all practical purposes to any terrestrial distance, but eveneffects of cosmic magnitude may be created.Nikola Tesla On 6 November 1915, The New York Times announced that Tesla and Edison had beenawarded the Nobel Prize for physics. The source of the story, apparently, wasthe Copenhagen correspondent of the Daily Telegraph. Tesla had received nonotification, but when interviewed by the Times he said that he thought he hadbeen given the Nobel Prize for a device he had filed a patent for a monthearlier that made it ‘practicable to project the human voice not only for adistance of 5,000 miles, but clear across the globe. I demonstrated this inColorado in 1899.’ He went on to explain how it would work:The plant would simply be connected with the telephone exchange of New York Cityand a subscriber will be able to talk to any other telephone subscriber in theworld, and all this without any change in his apparatus. This plan has beencalled my ‘world system’. By the same means I propose also to transmit picturesand project images, so that the subscriber will not only hear the voice, but seethe person to whom he is talking …A further advantage would be that the transmission is instant and free of theunavoidable delay experienced with the use of wire and cables. As I have alreadymade known, the current passes through the earth, starting from the transmissionstation with infinite speed, slowing down to the speed of light at a distance of6,000 miles, then increasing in speed from that region and reaching thereceiving station again with infinite velocity.It’s all a wonderful thing. Wireless is coming to mankind in its full meaninglike a hurricane some of these days. Some day there will be, say, six greatwireless telephone stations in a ‘world system’ connecting all the inhabitantsof this earth to one another not only by voice but by sight. It’s surely coming. Illuminating the SkyThis discovery had a direct bearing on the problems uppermost in the public’smind, he said, the perfection of wireless telephony. On 7 November, he told theTimes:We will deprive the ocean of its terrors by illuminating the sky, thus avoidingcollisions at sea and other disasters caused by darkness. We will draw unlimitedquantities of water from the oceans and irrigate the deserts and other aridregions. In this way we will fertilize the soil and derive any amount of powerfrom the sun. I also believe that ultimately all battles, if they should come,will be waged by electrical waves instead of explosives.He would say nothing further on the matter. However, he agreed that Edisondeserved a dozen Nobel Prizes, though he said he had no idea which one he hadbeen awarded the prize for. When shown the despatch, Edison wisely declined tocomment. Meanwhile the idea of winning the prize had gone to Tesla’s head. Hewrote to the Johnsons:In a thousand years, there will be many recipients of the Nobel Prize. But Ihave not less than four dozen of my creations identified with my name in thetechnical literature. These are honours real and permanent, which are bestowednot by a few who are apt to err, but by the whole world which seldom makes amistake, and for any of these I would give all the Nobel prizes during the nextthousand years … Josie will never had the chance of turning me away as a beggar,but I shall give her soon, the opportunity of slamming your door in the face ofa millionaire.This was no joke to Robert Johnson who had fallen on hard times. He wrote later:‘When that Nobel Prize comes, remember that I am holding onto my house by theskin of my teeth and desperately in need of cash!’As it was, neither Tesla nor Edison was awarded the prize. That year the NobelPrize for physics went to William Bragg and his son Lawrence for their researchinto crystalline structures using X-rays. Tesla had not even been nominated,though Edison was. Tesla was not nominated until 1937 and did not get it theneither.However, Tesla’s long-standing friend and first biographer John O’Neill saidthat Tesla actually turned down the award. ‘To have the award go first toMarconi, and then to be asked to share the award with Edison, was too great aderogation of the relative value of his work to the world for Tesla to bearwithout rebelling,’ he wrote in Prodigal Genius. According to O’Neill, Tesla didnot put himself in the same category as Edison. He considered himself adiscoverer of new principles, while Edison was an inventor who exploited newdiscoveries for commercial gain. The Bolts of ThorAlthough The New York Times had announced that the Braggs had won the NobelPrize on 14 November 1915, it continued to say that Tesla was a 1915 Nobel Prizewinner in an article on 8 December, headlined Tesla’s New Device Like Bolts ofThor, when the paper reported that he was taking out a patent on a ‘manlessairship’. It had neither an engine nor wings and could be sent at a speed of 300miles (480 km) a second to any place on the globe using electricity. Accordingto the Times:Ten miles or a thousand miles, it will all be the same to the machine, theinventor says. Straight to the point, on land or on sea, it will be able to gowith precision, delivering a blow that will paralyze or kill, as is desired. Aman in a tower on Long Island could shield New York against ships or army byworking a lever …Tesla refused to go into further details. However, he dismissed electricalengineer Charles H. Harris’s suggestion that, in time of war, the country wouldbe surrounded by ‘an electrical wall of fire’ as ‘not practical’ as it wouldtake more than all the generators in the US to power it. Describing RadarWhile Tesla’s ideas on unmanned airships and bolts of Thor seem unworldly, healso described a way of detecting ships at sea. His idea was to transmithigh-frequency radio waves that would reflect off the hulls of vessels andappear on a fluorescent screen. In 1917, he said: ‘We may produce at will, froma sending station, an electrical effect in any particular region of the globe;we may determine the relative position or course of a moving object, such as avessel at sea, the distance traversed by the same, or its speed.’ This was oneof the first descriptions of what we now call radar. Again it was too far aheadof its time to be taken seriously. However, in 1934 the French engineer ÉmileGirardeau (1882 – 1970) built an obstacle-locating radio apparatus – ‘conceivedaccording to the principles stated by Tesla,’ he said – and obtained a patentfor a working system, part of which was installed on the liner Normandie in1935. The Edison Medal [chapter-28.xhtml#b81]In 1917, Tesla was awarded the Edison Medal by the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers. According to O’Neill, Tesla was reluctant to accept it atfirst, but was persuaded to do so by the chairman of the medal committee,Bernard A. Behrend [chapter-29.xhtml#b108], who was an admirer and closepersonal friend. Tesla turned the medal down initially because it was nearly 30years since he had announced his rotating electric field and his AC system tothe Institute. ‘I do not need its honours and someone else may find it useful,’he said. Pressed by Behrend for further explanation, Tesla said:You propose to honour me with a medal which I could pin on my coat and strut fora vain hour before the members and guests of your Institute. You would bestow anoutward semblance of honouring me but you would decorate my body and continue tolet it starve, for failure to supply recognition, my mind and its creativeproducts which have supplied the foundation upon which the major portion of yourInstitute exists. And when you would go through the vacuous pantomime ofhonouring Tesla you would not be honouring Tesla but Edison who had previouslyshared unearned glory from every previous recipient of this medal.Despite his rancour, Tesla was cajoled into accepting the Medal. After all itcould hardly be awarded to Edison. But the acceptance speech presented Teslawith something of a problem. When he had addressed the AIEE in 1888, he had alab where he could prepare his demonstrations. Now he had none. Nor could heexpect to equal the lectures he had taken on the road in the 1890s. He had noprops.After a private dinner at the Engineers’ Club, the medal winner was to give aformal address in the auditorium of the United Engineering Societies Building.However, as the members of the Institute assembled there, Tesla was nowhere tobe seen. Behrend found him feeding the pigeons in the plaza of New York PublicLibrary. As Behrend approached, Tesla had pigeons perched on his head, shouldersand arms, and he had a carpet of them pecking at seed around his feet. It wasclear that the pigeons meant more to him than the members of AIEE. Behrendbegged Tesla not to let him down. The Wheels of Industry Will CeaseIn the auditorium of the United Engineering Societies Building, Behrend saidthat Tesla had been taken temporarily unwell, but he was now okay and theproceedings would be delayed by about 20 minutes. When the presentation began DrArthur Kennelly [chapter-29.xhtml#b109] from the Edison company said that Teslawas being awarded the Edison Medal for the development of rotating magneticfields, which had made it possible to use AC in electric motors, and for hisinvestigations into high-frequency currents.Charles A. Terry, who had worked with Tesla on some of his early research, ranthrough Tesla’s achievements to date. Behrend followed up by pointing out that,by an extraordinary coincidence, Tesla had given the first lecture on polyphaseAC there exactly 29 years earlier, adding:Not since the appearance of Faraday’s experimental researches in electricity hasa great experimental truth been voiced so simply and so clearly as thisdescription of Mr Tesla’s great discovery of the generation and utilization ofpolyphase alternating currents. He left nothing to be done for those whofollowed him. His paper contained the skeleton even of the mathematical theory.Three years later, in 1891, there was given the first great demonstration, bySwiss engineers, of the transmission of power at 30,000 volts from Lauffen toFrankfurt by means of Mr Tesla’s system. A few years later this was followed bythe development of the Cataract Construction Company, under the presidency ofour member, Edward D. Adams, and with the aid of the engineers of theWestinghouse Company. It is interesting to recall here tonight that in LordKelvin’s report to Mr Adams, Lord Kelvin recommended the use of direct currentfor the development of power at Niagara Falls and for its transmission toBuffalo.The due appreciation or even enumeration of the results of Mr Tesla’s inventionis neither practicable nor desirable at this moment. There is a time for allthings. Suffice it to say that, were we to seize and to eliminate from ourindustrial world the results of Mr Tesla’s work, the wheels of industry wouldcease to turn, our electric cars and trains would stop, our towns would be dark,our mills would be dead and idle. Yea, so far-reaching is this work that it hasbecome the warp and woof of industry … His name marks an epoch in the advance ofelectrical science. From that work has sprung a revolution in the electricalart.Behrend then asked Tesla to accept the Medal, not for the purposes ofperpetuating his name – ‘the name of Tesla runs no more risk of oblivion thandoes that of Faraday, or that of Edison’. Nor was the Medal evidence thatTesla’s work had received official sanction – ‘his work stands in no need ofsuch sanction’.No, Mr Tesla, we beg you to cherish this medal as a symbol of our gratitude forthe new creative thought, the powerful impetus, akin to revolution, which youhave given to our art and to our science. You have lived to see the work of yourgenius established. What shall a man desire more than this? There rings out tous a paraphrase of Pope’s lines on Newton: ‘Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid innight. God said, Let Tesla be, and all was light.’ Tesla’s Acceptance SpeechAccepting the Edison Medal, Tesla said he was grateful for the sympathy andappreciation shown him. Great strides had been made in the transmission andtransformation of energy, he said, but ‘we are pressing on, inspired with thehope and conviction that this is just the beginning, a forerunner of further andstill greater accomplishments’. He had not written an acceptance speech andspoke off the cuff, saying:I come from a very wiry and long-lived race. Some of my ancestors have beencentenarians, and one of them lived 129 years. I am determined to keep up therecord, and believe there is a prospect of accomplishing it. Then, nature hasgiven me a vivid imagination which, through incessant exercise and training,through the study of scientific subjects, and the verification of theoriesthrough experiment, has become very accurate in results, so that I have beenable to dispense, to a large extent, with the slow labours, wasteful andexpensive processes of practical development of the ideas I conceive. It hasmade it possible for me to explore extended fields with great rapidity and getresults with the least expenditure of vital energy. By this means, I may tellyou also, I am able to picture the objects of my desires in forms so real andtangible that I can rid myself of that morbid craving for perishable possessionsto which so many succumb.My life was also wonderful in another respect, for physical endurance or energy.If you inquire into the career of successful men in the inventor’s profession,you will find, as a rule, that they are as remarkable for their physical as fortheir mental capacities … When I turned my thoughts to inventions, I found thatI could visualize my conceptions with the greatest facility. I did not need anymodels and drawings or experiments, I could do it all in my mind, and I did. Theway I unconsciously evolved what I considered a new method in materializinginventive concepts and ideas, is exactly opposed to the purely experimentalmethod, of which undoubtedly Edison is the greatest and most successfulexponent.The moment you construct a device to carry into practice a crude idea you willfind that you will be engrossed with the details and effects of the apparatus.As you go on changing and constructing, you will lose the forces ofconcentration, and you will lose sight of the great underlying principle. Youobtain results, but at the sacrifice of quality. I did not construct. When I gotan idea, I started right away to build it up in my mind. I changed thestructure, I made improvements, I experimented, and I ran the device in my mind.It is absolutely the same to me whether I place my turbine in my mind or have itin my shop actually running in my test. It makes no difference. The results arethe same. In this way you see I can develop and perfect an invention withouttouching anything, and when I have gone so far that I have put into that deviceevery possible improvement I can think of, that I can see no fault in it anymore, I then construct it, and every time my device works as I conceived itwould, my experiment comes out exactly as I plan it, and in 20 years there hasnot been a single, solitary experiment which did not come out exactly as Ithought it would."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 12 – Destroying the Dream I have received reports which have completely confounded me all the more as I amnow doing important work for the government with a view of putting the plant toa special moment… I trust that you will appreciate the seriousness of thesituation and will see that the property is taken good care of and that allapparatus is carefully preserved.Nikola Tesla Tesla had signed over Wardenclyffe to the Waldorf-Astoria as he could not payhis hotel bill which had now reached $20,000 ($400,000 at today’s prices).However, he still hoped it would be returned when he raised the money to pay thebill, but the hotel management was determined to demolish the tower and sell offparts. Tesla’s response was to emphasize the tower’s usefulness in the event ofwar. It was, after all, home to his death ray and could shatter armies with its‘Bolts of Thor’. Nevertheless, he was told that the demolition of the tower wasto go ahead. With the US now in World War I, there would be no more money. Aspart of the war effort, Westinghouse, American Marconi and AT&T were allowed topool their patents and produced each other’s equipment without compensating theoriginal inventors. ‘A great wrong has been done,’ he wrote later, ‘but I amconfident that justice will prevail.’In July 1917, Tesla left the Waldorf-Astoria where he had lived for 20 years.After persuading the management to let him keep many of his personal effects inthe basement, he took the train to Chicago where he planned to continue work onhis bladeless turbines. There he moved into the Blackstone Hotel next door tothe University of Chicago.The following month, Tesla received a letter from George Scherff, his secretary,telling him that explosives experts had placed charges on major struts of thetower at Wardenclyffe and had blown them up. Suspicions of EspionageMeanwhile the story was circulated that suspected German spies had been usingthe tower for radio communication. The Electrical Experimenter said: ‘Suspectingthat German spies were using the big wireless tower erected at Shoreham, L.I.,about 20 years ago by Nikola Tesla, the Federal Government ordered the towerdestroyed and it was recently demolished with dynamite. During the past monthseveral strangers had been seen lurking about the place.’And the New York Sun gleefully reported: ‘The destruction of Nikola Tesla’sfamous tower … shows forcibly the great precautions being taken at this time toprevent any news of military importance getting to the enemy.’Tesla was upset by the implication that he was disloyal to his new country. Hehad argued that the structure should have been preserved to help locate anddestroy enemy submarines. If the tower had been destroyed to curb spying, Teslapointed out that he should have been compensated by the government for the largeamount of money he had put into it. As it was, he made no public protest whenthe US was at war. However, 2 years later he wrote that his dream had beendestroyed by rivals, saying:I am unwilling to accord to some small-minded and jealous individuals thesatisfaction of having thwarted my efforts. These men are to me nothing morethan microbes of a nasty disease. My project was retarded by the laws of nature.The world was not prepared for it. It was too far ahead of time, but the samelaws will prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success. Telephony Takes OverWith Tesla’s World Telegraphy Centre now in pieces, representatives of AmericanMarconi, AT&T, Westinghouse and GE got together behind closed doors inWashington and formed RCA. At the end of the war, radio stations were returnedto their rightful owners, favouring RCA. Using Marconi patents, Westinghouse setup independently. In 1920, Tesla wrote, offering his services. They wererefused. However, a little later, Westinghouse wrote again, asking Tesla if hewould like to broadcast to their ‘invisible audience’ one Thursday evening.Tesla replied that, 20 years earlier, he had promised his friend J.P. Morganthat his ‘world system’ would enable the voice of a telephone subscriber to betransmitted to any point on the globe. ‘I prefer to wait until my project iscompleted before addressing an invisible audience,’ he said proudly. The Science Fantasy FactorThough Tesla’s tower was in ruins, the idea would live on. Before leaving NewYork, Tesla teamed up with long-term admirer Hugo Gernsback[chapter-29.xhtml#b110], the editor of Electrical Experimenter. He had met Teslain 1908 when he visited his lab to see a bladeless turbine. Eleven years later,Gernsback recorded his impressions in Electrical Experimenter:The door opens and out steps a tall figure – over 6 ft high – gaunt but erect.It approaches slowly, stately. You become conscious at once that you areface-to-face with a personality of a high order. Nikola Tesla advances andshakes your hand with a powerful grip, surprising for a man over 60. A winningsmile from piercing light blue-grey eyes, set in extraordinarily deep sockets,fascinates you and makes you feel at once at home.You are guided into an office immaculate in its orderliness. Not a speck of dustis to be seen. No papers litter the desk, everything just so. It reflects theman himself, immaculate in attire, orderly and precise in his every movement.Dressed in a dark frock coat, he is entirely devoid of all jewellery. No ring,stickpin, or even watch-chain can be seen.Tesla speaks – a very high almost falsetto voice. He speaks quickly and veryconvincingly. It is the man’s voice chiefly which fascinates you.As he speaks you find it difficult to take your eyes off his own. Only when hespeaks to others do you have a chance to study his head, predominant of which isa very high forehead with a bulge between the eyes – the never-failing sign ofan exceptional intelligence. Then the long, well-shaped nose, proclaiming thescientist.How does this man, who has accomplished such tremendous work, keep young andmanage to surprise the world with more and more new inventions as he growsolder?How does this youth of sixty, who is a professor of mathematics, a greatmechanical and electrical engineer and the greatest inventor of all times, keephis physical as well as remarkable mental freshness?Gernsback employed the artist Frank R. Paul [chapter-29.xhtml#b111] to show theworld what Tesla’s tower would have looked liked if it had been completed. Forthe cover of the Electrical Experimenter Paul added transmitters and Tesla’swingless flying machines zapping nearby ships with their death-rays. Tesla wasso thrilled, he used the illustration as his letterhead.In 1919, Electrical Experimenter serialized Tesla’s autobiography My Inventions.This too was illustrated by Frank Paul’s drawing, along with photographs of theequipment. This boosted the circulation of the magazine to around 100,000 andprovided Tesla a modest income. However, Tesla felt he had been underpaid andwhen Gernsback sought to put him on the cover of Electrical Experimenter again,Tesla refused, saying: ‘I appreciate your unusual intelligence and enterprise,but the trouble with you seems to be that you are thinking only of H. Gernsbackfirst of all, once more, and then again.’Nevertheless, Gernsback never stinted in his praise of Tesla, running hisarticles in several of his magazines. He even latched on to some of Tesla’s moreoutlandish ideas. While Tesla did not believe in extra-sensory perception ormind-reading in the psychic sense, he did think it possible to read anotherperson’s thoughts by attaching television equipment to their retina. Pauldepicted this on the cover of Science Wonder Stories in October 1929 whichshowed two people wearing thought-reading helmets. The Chicago YearsTesla stayed in Chicago until the end of World War I. He worked on his turbinesat Pyle National. Again he refused a salary, hoping to make bigger profits fromhis inventions in the end. But earning nothing from his wireless patents, hisonly source of income was the Waltham Watch Company who were manufacturing aspeedometer he had designed. Advertisements for Waltham speedometers andautomobile clocks in The New York Times in 1921 read:Every progressive automobile manufacturer is adding improvements to his car.This is why the first Air-Friction Speedometer in the world, invented by NikolaTesla, perfected and developed by Waltham during the past few years, has won theunqualified approval of the world’s greatest automotive engineers. You will findthis exclusive Air-Friction instrument upon such cars as the Cunningham,Lafayette, Leach-Biltwell, Lincoln, Packard, Pierce-Arrow, Renault, Rolls-Royce,Stevens-Duryea, Wills-Sainte Claire and others. It provides instantaneousaccuracy with that dependability for which Waltham is famous. The Big ShipTesla was still depending on his turbines to make him rich ‘within four months’,he told Jack Morgan before he left New York. ‘My big ship is still to come in,’he said, ‘but I have a marvellous opportunity having perfected an invention thatwill astound the whole world.’But he had yet to perfect it. The high rotational speed put too much stress onthe discs which risked cracking. Various alloys were tried. However, theadvantages of his turbine was obvious. ‘Suppose that the steam pressure of thelocomotive would vary from say 50 to 200 pounds, no matter how rapidly,’ hewrote, ‘this would not have the slightest effect on the performance of theturbine.’The US Machine Manufacturing Company asked about putting one in an aeroplane.The Chicago Pneumatic Tool Company also made enquiries. He told George Scherffthat he was expecting to make $25 million a year from his turbines. All thewhile the debts kept piling up. Made in MilwaukeeTesla finally succeeded in getting the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company ofMilwaukee interested. They made reciprocating engines, turbines and other heavymachinery. However, he displayed a lack of tactic and diplomacy that ruined theproject from the outset. Insisting on entering negotiations with the seniorstaff, he went directly to the president of the company and, while his engineerswere preparing a feasibility report, Tesla contacted the board of directors andsold them the idea before the engineers had had their say.Three of Tesla’s turbines were built. Two had 20 discs that were 18 inches (46cm) in diameter. Tested with 80 pounds pressure, they developed 200 horsepowerat between 10,000 and 12,000 rpm. This had the same output as Tesla’s 1911 modelwith discs half the diameter when operating at 125 pounds pressure and 9,000rpm. They also built a larger version. Hans Dahlstrand, consulting engineer ofthe steam turbine department, wrote a report saying:We also built a 500 kilowatt steam turbine to operate at 3,600 revolutions. Theturbine rotor consisted of 15 disks 60 inches [152 cm] in diameter andone-eighth of an inch thick [3 mm]. The discs were placed approximatelyone-eighth inch apart. The unit was tested by connecting to a generator. Themaximum mechanical efficiency obtained on this unit was approximately 38 percent when operating at steam pressure of approximately 80 pounds absolute and aback pressure of approximately 3 pounds absolute and 100°F [38°C] superheat atthe inlet. When the steam pressure was increased above that given the mechanicalefficiency dropped, consequently the design of these turbines was of such anature that in order to obtain maximum efficiency at high pressure, it wouldhave been necessary to have more than one turbine in series.Dahlstrand reported that difficulties were encountered in the Tesla turbine fromvibration, making it necessary to re-enforce the discs, and that this difficultyis common to all turbines. Vibration cracked wheels and wrecked turbines,sometimes within a few hours and sometimes after years of operation. Thisvibration was caused by taking such terrific amounts of power from relativelylight machinery. The Dahlstrand Report identified other problems:The efficiency of the small turbine units compares with the efficiencyobtainable on small impulse turbines running at speeds where they can bedirectly connected to pumps and other machinery. It is obvious, therefore, thatthe small unit in order to obtain the same efficiency had to operate at from10,000 to 12,000 revolutions and it would have been necessary to providereduction gears between the steam turbine and the driven unit.Furthermore, the design of the Tesla turbine could not compete as far asmanufacturing costs with the smaller type of impulse units. It is alsoquestionable whether the rotor disks, because of light construction and highstress, would have lasted any length of time if operating continuously.The above remarks apply equally to the large turbine running at 3,600revolutions. It was found when this unit was dismantled that the discs haddistorted to a great extent and the opinion was that these discs wouldultimately have failed if the unit had been operated for any length of time.The gas turbine was never constructed for the reason that the company was unableto obtain sufficient engineering information from Mr Tesla indicating even anapproximate design that he had in mind. Terminating the TurbineTesla seems to have walked out at this stage. Later Tesla was asked why hestopped working with Allis-Chalmers. He said: ‘They would not build the turbinesas I wished.’ But he would not elaborate. Allis-Chalmers went on to manufacturea different type of gas turbine that was in production for years.A number of engineers had tried to explain the failure of Tesla’s turbine. Oneexpert said that, while being a fine concept and an excellent machine, it wasnot that much better than other designs. Another said that not enough money hadbeen spent on research and development. Metallurgy was in its infancy and theinstrumentation for measuring its performance had not been developed, nor hadthe magnetic bearing it would have needed to run efficiently. However,manufacturers have made pumps using Tesla’s principles and others haveexperimented with making the discs using advanced materials such as carbonfibre, titanium-impregnated plastic and Kevlar.In disappointment, Tesla returned to Colorado Springs where he conducted someexperiments in the lab of the local engineering school and relived old times.After a sojourn at Waltham Watches in Boston, he worked on a petrol-poweredturbine at Budd Manufacturing in Philadelphia. And he was not without hissuccesses. He sold a motor that was used in cinema equipment to WisconsinElectric and a ‘fluid diode’ to an oil company that was said to be ‘the onlyvalving patent without moving parts’. Money began coming in, but never in theamounts that he over-optimistically predicted. Planet Earth Calling ...Marconi moved onto Tesla’s patch again when he claimed to have detected radiosignals coming from outside the atmosphere. Tesla pooh-poohed this, claimingthat Marconi was only picking up signals from other terrestrial wirelessoperators. This could not have been the case with his own signals from Mars in1899, he claimed, as there were no radio transmitters with a range of more thana few miles at that time. Nevertheless Robert Johnson wrote to Tesla pointingout that, once again, when Marconi had repeated one of his ideas, it was ‘nolonger laughed at’.‘Communication with intelligence on other stars? It may someday be possible,’said Marconi. Language may be a problem, but Marconi said:Well, it is an obstacle, but I don’t think it is insurmountable. You see, onemight get through some message such as 2 plus 2 equals 4, and go on repeating ituntil an answer came back signifying ‘Yes’, which would be one word. Mathematicsmust be the same throughout the physical universe. By sticking to mathematicsover a number of years one might come to speech. It is certainly possible.Tesla said that he had little confidence in Marconi’s idea of trying tocommunicate with aliens using mathematics. He thought it would be better to sendpictures by wireless – the human face, for example. The New York Times wassurely being sarcastic when it suggested that they follow up by sending movies.Perhaps it could even be a commercial enterprise. ‘With this beginning wholefeature films can be sent by radio across the solar system and released on Marson the night that sees their premiere on Broadway,’ the paper said.In 1919, rocket-pioneer Robert Goddard (1882 – 1945) published A Method ofReaching Extreme Altitudes, claiming that it would be possible to send things asfar as the Moon. Tesla said that this scheme seemed far-fetched as the fuelsthen known did not have the necessary ‘explosive power’. He also doubted thatany rocket could ‘operate at 459° [F] below zero – the temperature ofinterplanetary space’."},{"pageContent":"PART FOUR: DESCENT AND RE-ASSESSMENT"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 13 – Talking to Pigeons I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them, for years; thousands of them.But there was one pigeon, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips onits wings; that one was different. It was a female. I would know that pigeonanywhere. No matter where I was, that pigeon would find me; when I wanted her Ihad only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. She understood meand I understood her. I loved that pigeon. I loved her as a man loves a woman,and she loved me … As long as I had her, there was a purpose in my life.Nikola Tesla Back in New York, Tesla moved into the Hotel St Regis. Robert Johnson had beenappointed ambassador to Italy, so his friends left for Rome. On his own, Teslabecame more eccentric. He would circle the block three times before entering thehotel, avoiding stepping on the cracks in the sidewalk. And he was fanaticalabout cleanliness, except when it came to pigeons which he still fed outside theNew York Public Library.Having given up the appetites of his youth, he now practised what he called‘gastronomical frugality’ to which he owed his perpetual youth. According toHugo Gernsback, Tesla believed that most people not only eat all of their bodilyills, but actually ate themselves to death by either consuming too much, or elseby eating food that does not agree with them. His daily menu consisted of:Breakfast: One to two pints of warm milk and a few eggs, prepared by himself.Lunch: None whatsoever, as a rule.Dinner: Celery soup or similar, a single piece of meat or fowl, potatoes and oneother vegetable; a glass of light wine. For dessert, perhaps a slice of cheese,and invariably a big raw apple.And that’s all.While he ate very little, Tesla insisted that what he did eat must be of thehighest quality. He was also an accomplished cook who invented a number ofappetizing dishes.‘His only vice is his generosity,’ said Gernsback. ‘The man who, by the ignorantonlooker has often been called an idle dreamer, has made over a million dollarsout of his inventions – and spent them as quickly on new ones. But Tesla is anidealist of the highest order and to such men, money itself means but little.’ Filet Mignon and Roast DuckTesla’s frugal diet in his later years is markedly different from hisconsumption in his heyday. Then at dinner he would enjoy thick steaks,preferably filet mignon, and often two or three of them, though he never put onweight. He remained 10 stone (142 pounds or 64 kg), from 1888 to around 1926except for a brief period of illness, when he lost 5 pounds (2 kg).Later he turned to lamb, ordering a roast saddle large enough to serve severalpeople. He would eat only the central portion of the tenderloin. Anotherfavourite was a crown of baby lamb chops, or duck roasted under a layer ofcelery stalks – a dish of his own invention. He would often supervise itscooking in the kitchen and it would be the centre-piece when entertainingfriends. But Tesla would only eat the meat either side of the breast bone.Gradually, he substituted boiled fish, then turned to a vegetarian diet.Throughout his life he drank milk and towards the end warm milk became themainstay of his diet. When he was young, he drank a lot of coffee. Although hedecided it was bad for him, he had difficulty giving it up. So with each meal,he would order a pot of coffee so that he could smell the aroma. Eventually hewent off the smell and gave up this practice. He had always avoided tea andcocoa, but, along with wine, he drank whisky. This, he believed, was responsiblefor the longevity of his ancestors and prolonged his own life. When Prohibitionwas introduced in 1919, Tesla denounced it, saying it was an intolerableinfringement of the rights of an individual. ‘It imposes restrictions on themost needed and harmless of stimulants,’ he said, ‘while permitting unlimitedconsumption of poisons by all classes, from childhood to old age.’He admitted that he had consumed enough alcoholic beverages to ‘form a lake ofno mean dimensions’. But, being a law-abiding citizen, he gave it up, declaringthat it was 6 months before he could digest a meal and that abstinence wouldreduce his life-expectation to 130 years.‘I feel sure that if everyone had done the same,’ he said, ‘millions ofAmericans would have shortened their life-span and thousands would have died inthe first 2 years. A sudden change of diet or the omission of one of itsimportant elements, especially in advanced years, is extremely dangerous.’In later years, after the repeal of Prohibition, he would have a bottle of winebrought in an ice bucket, but not have it opened. It remained there purely toshow that he could restrain himself from drinking.He had also been a heavy smoker in his youth, particularly enjoying cigars.However, when he was in his early twenties, one of his sisters fell ill. Shesaid she could try to get better if he gave up smoking. She recovered and henever smoked again. Extreme Germ PhobiaAfter studying microscopic organisms before he left Europe, Tesla developed aphobia about germs. The washroom in his laboratory was private. No one else wasallowed to use it. He would be impelled to wash his hands on the slightestpretext, insisting that his secretary provide a freshly laundered towel eachtime to dry them. He would also avoid shaking hands, usually keeping his handsclasped behind him in social situations.This led to embarrassment when visitors advanced proffering their hand. If Teslawas caught unawares and his hand was shaken, he would rush to the washroom atthe first possible opportunity to scrub it, ignoring any business the visitorwas there to conduct. And he found it particularly nauseating when workmen atetheir lunch with dirty hands. Hotel staff were kept at a distance of at least 3feet.Head waiters grew used to his demand to be seated at a table that was not to beused by other customers. He needed a fresh table cloth with every meal and twodozen serviettes. The silverware had to be sterilized before it left thekitchen. Tesla would then pick each item up with a serviette, and polish it withanother. Then he would drop both serviettes on the floor before attending to thenext item of cutlery. And if a fly alighted on the table, he would insist thateverything was removed from the table and the meal would start over.He lived in hotels that could meet his meticulous standards and only employedassistants that were scrupulously clean. When he visited the barbers to have hishalf-hour scalp massage three times a week, he insisted on fresh towels on hischair, but strangely he did not object to being shaved using the same brush andshaving mug as the other customers. Stepping Out in StyleTo the end of his life, Tesla was a fastidious dresser. Well-cut clothes suitedhis tall, slim figure. ‘In the matter of clothes’, he observed, ‘the world takesa man at his own valuation.’ He wore white monogrammed silk shirts that had towithstand constant laundering. Collars and cuffs were discarded after a singleuse, as were handkerchiefs. Ties were replaced every week. Costing a dollareach, the only colours he would consider were red and black. They were tied inthe old-fashioned, four-in-hand style. His pyjamas also had his initialsembroidered on the left breast and his linen arrived freshly packaged.Except on formal occasions, Tesla wore high-laced shoes, possibly to give hisankles extra support because of his height. They extended halfway up his calves.He insisted on a long narrow shoe with a tapered, square toe which had to behandmade.His suits had waisted coats and he usually wore a black bowler or derby, whichgave him an air of quiet elegance. He carried a cane and wore grey suede gloves.At $2.50 a pair, they were also replaced weekly, even if they were as clean asthey had been when they came from the makers. Restless Sleeping HabitsTesla claimed that he usually slept for just 2 hours a night, 3 hours being toomuch. But he would go to bed at 5 am and get up at 10, the extra three hoursrest, he maintained was for quiet contemplation. Once a year, he would sleep forthe full 5 hours which, he said, gave him a tremendous reserve of energy.In this, he competed with Edison who claimed only to sleep 4 hours a night,though when he sat in his lab he would take two 3-hour naps a day. Teslaprobably did the same. Hotel staff said that they often found him sittingtransfixed and they found they could work around him in his home withoutdisturbing him.He took brisk walks to aid his concentration, but even then he was often in adream. People who he knew quite well could walk past him, even though heappeared to be looking straight at them. In 1935, he said he was lucky not tohave been killed while jaywalking in such a state. Two years later, he was hitby a taxi and badly injured though, refusing to see a doctor he limped home. Hehad three cracked ribs and was confined to bed for 6 months. Wardenclyffe RevisitedTesla still had not given up on Wardenclyffe and sued the Waldorf-Astoria overits destruction. He maintained that he had put up Wardenclyffe as collateralagainst the $20,000 he owed. They assumed that it was theirs. They had torn itdown to sell for scrap and resell the land. Tesla, of course, was expecting tomake $30,000 a day from Wardenclyffe if it was ever finished. If he then paidthe $20,000, the experimental station would then be his again. In court heinsisted that the Waldorf-Astoria were supposed to take care of it but, evenbefore it had been torn down, they had allowed vandals to break in and stealexpensive equipment.During the trial Tesla was to give a loving description of his lost palace. Theattorney for the Waldorf-Astoria tried to block this testimony, but the judgelet him go ahead.The building formed a square about 100 ft by 100 ft [30 by 30 m]. It was dividedinto four compartments, with an office and a machine shop and two very largeareas … The engines were located on one side and the boilers on the other side,and in the centre, the chimney rose. There were two 300-horsepower boilerssurrounded by two 16,000-gallon water tanks. To the right of the boiler plantwas one 400-horsepower Westinghouse engine and a smaller 35-kilowatt engine todrive the dynamo for the lighting. Along with them was the main switchboard thatcontrolled the pumps and various compressors.Towards the road, on the railroad side, was the machine shop. That compartmentwas 100 ft by 35 ft [30 m by 10 m] with a door in the middle and it contained, Ithink eight lathes. Then there was the milling machine, a planer and shaper, aspliner, three drills, four motors, a grinder and a blacksmith’s forge.Now, in the compartment opposite, there was contained the real expensiveapparatus. There were two special glass cases where I kept historical apparatuswhich was exhibited and described in my lectures and scientific articles. Therewere at least a thousand bulbs and tubes each of which represented a certainphase of scientific development.Then there was also five large tanks, four of which contained specialtransformers created so as to transform the energy for the plant. They wereabout, I should say, 7 ft [2 m] high and about 5 ft by 5 ft [1.5 by 1.5 m] each,and were filled with special oil which we call transformer oil, to stand anelectric tension of 60,000 volts. Then there was a fifth similar tank forspecial purposes. And there were my electric generating apparatus. Thatapparatus was precious because it could flash a message across the Atlantic, andyet it was built in 1894 or 1895.The Waldorf-Astoria’s attorney objected again, but the judge allowed Tesla tocontinue.Beyond the door of this compartment, there were to be condensers, what we callelectric condensers, which would store the energy and then discharge and make itgo around the world. Some of these condensers were in an advanced state ofconstruction, and others were not. Then there was a very expensive piece ofapparatus that the Westinghouse Company furnished me, only two of its kind haveever been constructed. It was developed by myself with their engineers. That wasa steel tank which contained a very elaborate assemblage of coils, and elaborateregulating apparatus, and it was intended to give every imaginable regulationthat I wanted in my measurements and control of energy. He went on to describe a special 100-horsepower motor equipped with elaboratedevices for rectifying the alternating currents and sending them back to thecondensers. On this apparatus alone, Tesla said he had spent thousands ofdollars. ‘Then along the centre of the room I had a very precious piece ofapparatus,’ he said. It was his remote-controlled boat. A Bolt from the BlueAsked whether that was all, Tesla replied: ‘Oh, no, nowhere near.’ And he wenton to describe a series of cupboards that contained numerous devices that eachrepresented a different phase in the development of his work. In the testingroom there were other instruments, some of which had been given to him by LordKelvin. Tesla then described the tower with its expensive underground workingscontaining special apparatus for ‘gripping the earth’.The shaft, your honour, was first covered with timber and the inside with steel.In the centre of this there was a winding stairs going down and in the centre ofthe stairs was a big shaft through which the current was to pass, and this shaftwas so figured in order to tell exactly where the nodal point is, so I couldcalculate exactly the size of the Earth or the diameter of the Earth and measureit exactly within 4 ft [1.2 m] with that machine.And then the real expensive work was to connect that central part with theearth, and there I had special machines rigged up which would push the ironpipes, one length after another, and I pushed, I think 16 of them, 300 ft [90m]. The current through these pipes was to take hold of the earth. Now that wasa very expensive part of the work, but it does not show on the tower, but itbelongs to the tower.The primary purpose of the tower, your honour, was to telephone, to send thehuman voice and likeness around the globe. That was my discovery, that Iannounced in 1893, and now all the wireless plants are doing that. There is notanother system being used. Then the idea was to reproduce this apparatus andconnect it just with a central station and telephone office, so that you maypick up your telephone and if you wanted to talk to a subscriber in Australiayou would simply call up that plant and that plant would connect youimmediately. And I had contemplated to have press messages, stock quotations,pictures for the press and reproductions of signatures, cheques and everythingtransmitted from there.Tesla was asked whether he had any warning that the tower was going to bedemolished. He replied, ‘No, sir. It came like a bolt from a blue sky…’Although the Waldorf-Astoria had not accounted for the machinery, they had soldoff and destroyed property worth $350,000 to recoup $20,000, the judge found infavour of the hotel, who also had the last word:As a solace to the wild hopes of this dreamy inventor, if prior to that time heshould grasp in his fingers any one of the castles in Spain which always werefloating about in his dreams, and had he paid the board bills which he owed,this wild scrubby woodland, including the Tower of Babel thereon, wouldcheerfully have been reconveyed to him. Listening to Communist OverturesThe 1920 US Presidential Election was the first to be broadcast to a nationalaudience – though Lee De Forest had announced the wrong winner to a smallaudience four years before. In Italy, Fascist leader Benito Mussolini (1883 –1945) saluted Marconi. His national broadcasting system allowed the dictator toreach the entire Italian nation after he came to power in 1922. Meanwhile,Vladimir Ilich Lenin (1870 – 1924), who had led the Bolshevik Revolution inRussia in 1917, made overtures to Tesla, asking him to come to the Soviet Unionto build power stations and an AC distribution system.Tesla was also invited to speak at a meeting of the Friends of Soviet Russia inSpringfield, Massachusetts, travelling there with Ivan Mashevkief from theRussian Workers Club of Manhattan. At the meeting, the organizers, a group ofItalian radicals, addressed Tesla mysteriously as ‘Bettini’. According to an FBIagent at the event, Tesla ‘prophesied that Italy would soon adopt a communistform of government’. However, there is no evidence that he knew what he wasgetting himself into. Tesla took little interest in politics and he was, atbest, naïve. Waiting for the Midnight HourWhile commuting to Milwaukee, Tesla was paying $15 a day for room 1607 in theHotel St Regis on Fifth Avenue. However, he neglected to pay for 7 months andwas forced to move to the Hotel Marguery on Park Avenue and 48th Street.Fortunately this was still close to his night-time haunts, Grand Central Stationand Bryant Park behind New York Public Library. He was spotted there one night,sporting his derby, cane and white gloves by the New York World:Midnight is the hour he chooses for his visits … Tall, well-dressed, ofdignified bearing, he whistles several times, a signal for the pigeons on theledges of the building to flutter down about his feet. With a generous hand, theman scatters peanuts on the lawn from a bag. A proud man, yet humble in hischarities – Nikola Tesla. How This Man Worked …A young science journalist named Kenneth Swezey, once praised by Albert Einsteinfor his explanation of the Archimedes principle, sought out Tesla. While Swezeywas only 19 and Tesla in his late sixties, they became firm friends for the restof his life. According to Swezey, Tesla sometimes greeted him at the door starknaked, but insisted that Tesla was ‘absolutely celibate’.He confirmed that Tesla slept less than 2 hours a night, though he wouldoccasionally doze to recharge his batteries. He would walk 8 to 10 miles a dayand relax in a bathtub, though gone was the electric shower that bombarded himwith cleansing particles. He would also clench and unclench his toes a hundredtimes each night to stimulate the brain cells. Swezey recalled:And how this man worked! I will tell you about a little episode … I was sleepingin my room like one dead. It was three after midnight. Suddenly the telephonering awakened me. Through my sleep I heard his voice, ‘Swezey, how are you, whatare you doing?’ This was one of many conversations in which I did not succeed inparticipating. He spoke animatedly, with pauses [as he had worked] out aproblem, comparing one theory to another, commenting: and when he felt hearrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone.In 1926, Tesla moved to the Hotel Pennsylvania. There the ‘tall, thin, asceticman’ was interviewed by Colliers magazine and he gave another of hispredictions: ‘This struggle of the human female toward sex equality will end ina new social order, with the human female as superior.’ Tesla forwarded hisprediction to J.P. Morgan’s daughter Anne, who he had remained in touch with andwas now an advocate for the women’s movement. Into the Realms of the FutureIt was around that time, Tesla retired. Miss Dorothy F. Skerritt, Tesla’ssecretary until he closed his office at 70, described him at that age:As one approached Mr Tesla you beheld a tall, gaunt man. He appeared to be analmost divine being. When about 70, he stood erect, his extremely thin bodyimmaculately and simply attired in clothing of a subdued colouring. Neitherscarf pin nor ring adorned him. His bushy black hair was parted in the middleand brushed back briskly from his high broad forehead, deeply lined by his closeconcentration on scientific problems that stimulated and fascinated him. Fromunder protruding eyebrows his deep-set, steel grey, soft, yet piercing eyes,seemed to read your innermost thoughts. As he waxed enthusiastic about fields toconquer and achievements to attain his face glowed with almost etherealradiance, and his listeners were transported from the commonplaces of today toimaginative realms of the future. His genial smile and nobility of bearingalways denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in hissoul. Too Great a SacrificeIn an interview with the New York World in 1926, he said: ‘Sometimes I feel thatby not marrying I made too great a sacrifice to my work, so I have decided tolavish all the affection of a man no longer young on the feathery tribe. I amsatisfied if anything I do will live for posterity. But to care for thosehomeless, hungry or sick birds is the delights of my life. It is my only meansof playing.’One particular pigeon was special to him. When he found it, it had a broken legand wing. ‘Using my mechanical knowledge, I invented a device by which Isupported its body in comfort in order to let the bones heal.’ He kept the birdin his hotel suite and figured that it cost him more than $2,000 to heal her. Ittook a year-and-a-half before she was well again and, Tesla said, she was ‘oneof the finest and prettiest birds I have ever seen’. My Life’s Work was Finished …His love of that one pigeon and her death affected him profoundly. He told JohnJ. O’Neill:When she was ill I knew, and understood; she came to my room and I stayed besideher for days. I nursed her back to health. That pigeon was the joy of my life.If she needed me, nothing else mattered. As long as I had her, there was apurpose in my life.Then one night as I was lying in my bed in the dark, solving problems, as usual,she flew in through the open window and stood on my desk. I knew she wanted me;she wanted to tell me something important so I got up and went to her.As I looked at her I knew she wanted to tell me – she was dying. And then, as Igot her message, there came a light from her eyes – powerful beams of light … itwas a real light, a powerful, dazzling, blinding light, a light more intensethan I had ever produced by the most powerful lamps in my laboratory.When that pigeon died, something went out of my life. Up to that time I knewwith a certainty that I would complete my work, no matter how ambitious myprogramme, but when that something went out of my life I knew my life’s work wasfinished."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 14 – A New Source of Energy I’m happy to hear that you are celebrating your 75th birthday, and that, as asuccessful pioneer in the field of high-frequency currents, you have been ableto witness the wonderful development of this field of technology. I congratulateyou on the magnificent success of your life’s work.Albert Einstein [chapter-29.xhtml#b112] While working on his petrol-powered turbine in Philadelphia in 1924 – 25, Teslamet John B. Flowers, an inspector of an aircraft factory. With development ofhis bladeless turbine reaching a dead end, Tesla returned to the idea ofpowering planes and cars remotely from large central power stations like the onehe had tried to build at Wardenclyffe. In Tesla’s hotel suite, Flowers helpeddraft a proposal to test and implement Tesla’s Wireless Power System to presentit to J. H. Dillinger, head of the Radio Laboratory at the Bureau of Standardsin Washington, DC.Flowers told Dillinger that Tesla’s system would power a plane at any pointaround the world and that Tesla had already developed an oscillator to providethe power which he was willing to give to the American government if they agreedto build the plant. A meeting in Washington was arranged and Dillinger sent theproposal to physicist Harvey L. Curtis (1875 – 1956).The 10-page document outlined a plan to use standing waves[chapter-28.xhtml#b80] to operate cars and planes. To demonstrate this, a sketchshowed a balloon, standing in for the Earth, and a mechanical oscillatorstanding in for the electrical device:… a mechanical oscillator arm was fastened to the tied opening of a rubberballoon 20 inches [50 cm] in diameter. The oscillator arm was operated with anelectrical motor at 1,750 rpm by means of an eccentric on the motor shaft. Theballoon hung free in the air. The rubber surface of the balloon represented theearth’s conducting surface and the air inside its insulating interior. The waveswere propagated in the rubber surface at the rate of 51 ft per second [15.5 mper second], the frequency of transmission was 29 cycles per second and thewavelength was 21 inches [53 cm].The mechanical oscillator was used in place of Tesla’s electrical oscillator asit presents an almost perfect analogy. Standing or stationary waves of therubber surface replace the electromagnetic waves of Tesla’s system. By the testof this analogue, the operation of Tesla’s system can be forecast. When theoscillator arm was set in motion by operating the motor, there were threestanding waves having six loops on the Earth’s surface – all having the sameamplitude of vibration!When the finger was pushed against one or more loops, all the loops were reducedin amplitude in the same proportion showing the ability to obtain all the powerout at one or more points! The waves extended completely around the world andreturned to the sending station.Curtis rejected the proposal as, with Tesla’s standing waves, there would be aconcentration of energy at the nodes. But, as Curtis pointed out:The system proposed by Mr Flowers does not have this feature. He proposes tocollect energy at any point … some means would have to be devised forconcentrating this energy and making it available. No such method has beenproposed, and I do not think of any that would be feasible … I do not know ofany wireless apparatus of sufficient magnitude to warrant the expectation thatpower can be economically transmitted by radio methods. Faster than the Speed of LightTesla denied that the electricity would be available only at the nodal points,advising that, in a hydraulic system, the pressure of the fluid is the samethroughout. There was energy available at an electrical outlet even when nothingis plugged in. He explained that the oscillations would spread from hismagnifying transmitter theoretically at an infinite speed, then slow down – atfirst very quickly, then at slower rate. After around 6,000 miles (9,500 km)they would travel at the speed of light.From there on it increases in speed, slowly at first, and then more rapidly,reaching the antipode with approximately an infinite velocity. The laws ofmotion can be expressed by stating that the waves on the terrestrial surfacesweep in equal intervals of time over equal areas, but it must be understoodthat the current penetrates deep into the Earth and the effects produced on thereceivers are the same as if the whole flow was confined to the Earth’s axisjoining the transmitter with the antipode. The mean surface speed is thus about471,200 km per second [292,790 miles a second] – 57 per cent greater than thatof the so-called Hertz waves.There was a problem with this. James Clerk Maxwell’s equations predicted thespeed of light at 186,000 miles a second (300,000 km a second). At first, it wasassumed that this speed was relative to the background ether thatelectromagnetic radiation propagated through. But the Michelson-Morleyexperiment showed there was no such thing as ether. Einstein realized that thismeant the speed of light was an absolute – and there was no such thing as aspeed faster than light.Tesla railed against Einstein and relativity. He would not accept the concept ofcurved space, as predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, either.But Einstein, with his Nobel Prize, was the new star in the scientificfirmament. Tesla, Edison, who died in 1931, Bell, who died in 1922, and theWright brothers, who died in 1912 and 1948, were old hat. Business As UsualDespite the rejection of their plans in Washington, Flowers and Tesla went toDetroit to try and sell his ‘flying automobile’ to General Motors. Tesla alsotried to sell his speedometer to Ford, but its high cost made it better suitedto luxury cars. In Detroit, Tesla met his nephew Nicholas Trbojevich and therewas an incident that became part of family lore. The two were going for a latesnack in an expensive hotel. The head waiter suggested that they wait fiveminutes. Then the $5 cover charge would be lifted. This was in the middle of theGreat Depression when $5 would feed a family for a week. But Tesla was notprepared to wait. When Trbojevich questioned his uncle over the matter of thecover charge, Tesla said: ‘I’ll never die rich unless the money comes in thedoor faster than I can shovel it out of the window.’Tesla held talks with US Steel concerning installing his bladeless turbines onthe exhaust from the blast furnaces, generating huge amounts of electricity.But, apparently, a test did not go ahead. Then in Buffalo, Tesla conducted sometop-secret experiments. It was said that the petrol engine of a Pierce-Arrowsedan was replaced by an AC induction motor. A ‘power receiver’ using 12 vacuumtubes was set in the dashboard connected to a 6 ft (2 m) antenna. There is otherspeculation that it was powered by a steam or petrol-driven turbine, but nophysical evidence of either design has been found.While experimenters were using Tesla Coils to try and split the atom, Teslahimself was making more outlandish predictions, saying that all the machinery onEarth could be powered by cosmic rays. Unlimited quantities of power could betransmitted through wires or wirelessly from a central station to anywhere onthe globe, eliminating the need for coal, oil, gas or any other terrestrialenergy source. Already the central source of energy on Earth was the Sun, hesaid, but the new source of power would not be turned off at night. Heralding a New Industrial RevolutionWith just five days to go to his 75th birthday, Tesla said that he would soonannounce ‘by far the most important discovery’ of his long career. ‘It willthrow light on many puzzling phenomena of the cosmos,’ he said, ‘and may provealso of great industrial value, particularly in creating a new and virtuallyunlimited market for steel.’He said that he had been wonderfully fortunate in coming up with new ideas thathe was sure would be remembered by posterity. He was confident that his rotatingmagnetic field, induction motor and wireless system would live on long after hewas gone, but he still considered his latest discoveries the most important.They would mark a new departure in science, be of great practical values andinaugurate a new industrial revolution, he said.He had already succeeded in proving his theories by experimentation and, if thecalculations based on them turned out to be true, the world would have a newsource of energy in practically unlimited amounts, available at any point on theglobe. But, again, he was tantalizingly vague when it came to the details:I can only say at this time that it will come from an entirely new andunsuspected source, and will be for all practical purposes constant, day andnight, and at all times of the year. The apparatus for capturing the energy andtransforming it will partake both mechanical and electrical features, and willbe of ideal simplicity. At first the cost may be found too high, but thisobstacle will be overcome. Moreover, the installment will be, so to speak,indestructible, and will continue to function for any length of time withoutadditional expenditures.The press had heard such promises from Tesla before and wanted to know when hewas going to make an official announcement of his new discoveries. But the greatman was unwilling to be pinned down. These ideas had not come to him overnight,but as the result of intense study and experimentation for nearly 36 years. Hesaid he was anxious to give the facts to the world as soon as possible, butwished to present them in a finished form. That may take a few months, or a fewyears, he said.All the energy that the Earth receives from all the suns and stars of theuniverse is only about one-quarter of one per cent of that which it receivesdirectly from the Sun. Therefore, it would be incomparably more rational toharness the heat and light rays of the Sun than attempt to capture theinsignificant energy of this radiation … We can do it now, and we are doing itto a certain extent. But the tremendous handicap is found in the periodiccharacter of this kind of energy supply. Many attempts have been made in thisdirection, but invariably it was found that the power was too expensive. Dismissing Atomic EnergyHaving rejected Einstein’s theory of relativity, Tesla also dismissed the ideaof atomic energy. ‘The idea of atomic energy is illusionary,’ he said, ‘but ithas taken so powerful a hold on the minds that, although I have preached againstit for 25 years, there still are some who believe it to be realizable.’He claimed to have disintegrated atoms in his experiments with thehigh-potential vacuum tube he developed in 1896, which he considered one of hisbest inventions. He operated at a range of potentials from 4 million to 18millions volts. More recently, he said, he had designed an apparatus that wouldwork at 50 million volts, which should produce results of great scientificimportance. ‘But as to atomic energy, my experimental observations have shownthat the process of disintegration is not accompanied by a liberation of suchenergy as might be expected from present theories,’ he said. Cosmic Rays and BeyondTesla claims to have discovered cosmic rays while investigating X-rays andradioactivity in Colorado Springs in 1899, but his findings were in disagreementwith theories advanced more recently:I have satisfied myself that the rays are not generated by the formation of newmatter in space, a process which would be like water running up hill. Nor dothey come to any appreciable amount from the stars. According to myinvestigations the Sun emits a radiation of such a penetrative power that it isvirtually impossible to absorb it in lead or other substances. It has,furthermore, other extraordinary properties in regard to which I shall expressmyself at some future date. This ray, which I call the primary solar ray, givesrise to a secondary radiation by impact against the cosmic dust scatteredthrough space. It is the secondary radiation which now is commonly called thecosmic rays, and comes, of course, equally from all directions in space.He also dismissed the idea that radioactivity resulted from activity withinradioactive substances. It was caused by rays emitted from the Sun. If radiumcould be screened effectively from this ray, it would cease to be radioactive,he said. He had also been designing rocket-ships that he said could attainspeeds of nearly a mile a second – 3,600 miles an hour (5,793 km per hour) –through the rarefied medium above the stratosphere. Again, he hoped hisrocket-ships would bring world peace:I anticipate that such machines will be of tremendous importance ininternational conflicts in the future. I foresee that in times not too distantwars between various countries will be carried on without a single combatantpassing the border. At this very time it is possible to construct such infernalmachines which will carry any desired quantity of poisoned gases and explosives,launch them against a target thousands of miles away and destroy a whole city.If wars are not done away with, we are bound to come eventually to this kind ofwarfare, because it is the most economical means of inflicting injury andstriking terror in the hearts of enemies that ever has been imagined. Denselypopulated countries, like England and Japan, will be at a great disadvantage ascompared with those embracing vast territories, such as the United States andRussia.Although some of Tesla’s ideas in later life can be dismissed as the ravings ofa mad scientist, sometimes he shows remarkable prescience. Sending Signals to the StarsWhen Time magazine put the ageing and eccentric inventor on their cover of the20 July 1931 issue to celebrate his 75th birthday, Tesla did not disappoint. Hetold them of his new invention, the Tesla-scope, that he could use to signal tothe stars, saying:I think that nothing can be more important than interplanetary communication. Itwill certainly come some day, and the certitude that there are other humanbeings in the universe, working, suffering, struggling like ourselves, willproduce a magic effect on mankind, and will form the foundation of a universalbrotherhood that will last as long as humanity itself.Asked when this would happen, he said: ‘I have been leading a secluded life, oneof continuous, concentrated thought and deep meditation. Naturally enough I haveaccumulated a great number of ideas. The question is whether my physical powerswill be adequate to working them out and giving them to the world.’He also claimed that with 15 million volts – ‘the highest ever used’ – he splitatoms over and over again, but no energy was released. The Time article carriedseveral other amusing stories about Tesla. It said that he left the ‘swank’Hotel St Regis after the maids complained that he kept four pet pigeons in hisroll-top desk and that, while walking down an icy Fifth Avenue, ‘he slipped,threw himself into a flying somersault, landed on his feet, unperturbed kept onwalking’. Time reported more eccentricities:At the Hotel Governor Clinton where he now lives, if someone rings him up on thetelephone or knocks at his door and he does not want to answer, he locks himselfin the bathroom, turns the water loudly on. He is very sensitive to sensorystimuli. When he gets excited, blinding lights flash through his mind. Heretreats to bed. A lifelong bachelor, habitually he goes to bed at 5.30 am,rises at 10.30 am. But he does not sleep the whole period. Proudly, yet almostplaintively, he explains: ‘I roll around and work on my problems.’ The Plaudits of PeersBirthday accolades flooded in. Over a hundred letters of congratulation werereceived from other scientists or inventors including Sir Oliver Lodge, Lee DeForest and Albert Einstein. Notably absent were birthday greetings from Marconiand Pupin. And none could match the tribute bestowed on Edison when he died 3months later and the lights of New York were dimmed in reverence.Naturally, Tesla was full of new predictions. ‘I feel that we are nearing aperiod when the human mind will perform greater wonders than ever before,’ hesaid. ‘This is due to the continuous refinement of means and methods ofobservation and ever-increasing delicacy of our perception.’We were about to conquer nature, contact beings on other planets and transmithuge amounts of power vast distances. A reporter from The New York Times againasked when he was going to make his discovery public. ‘There was a trace ofregret in his voice as he answered,’ said the paper, ‘and the look of a man whohas work enough for centuries and only a few years to do it in.’ Tesla thenquoted Goethe. ‘He had not read Goethe for 40 years, he said, and he quoted itfrom memory.’He was also at odds with the new ideas of quantum mechanics. ‘There is no chancein nature,’ he said, ‘although the modern theory of indeterminacy attempts toshow scientifically that events are governed by chance. I positively deny that.The causes and effects, however complex, are intimately linked, and the resultof all inferences must be inevitably fixed as by a mathematical formula.’ Waves in Time and SpaceHe re-asserted that human beings were automatons completely under the control ofexternal forces and he denied the existence of individuality, saying:It took me not less than 20 years to develop a faculty to trace every thought oract of mine to an external influence. We are just waves in time and space,changing continuously, and the illusion of individuality is produced through theconcatenation of the rapidly succeeding phases of existence. What we define aslikeness is merely the result of the symmetrical arrangement of molecules whichcompose our body.He also denied the existence of the soul or spirit, saying they were merelyexpressions of the functions of the body. ‘These functions cease with death andso do soul and spirit,’ he said. ‘What humanity needs is ideals. Idealism is theforce that will free us from material fetters.’ Photographing ThoughtAt 77, Tesla told a journalist from the Kansas City Journal-Post that heexpected soon to be able to photograph thoughts, explaining:In 1893, while engaged in certain investigations, I became convinced that adefinite image formed in thought must, by reflex action, produce a correspondingimage on the retina, which might possibly be read by suitable apparatus. Thisbrought me to my system of television, which I announced at that time. My ideawas to employ an artificial retina receiving the image of the object seen, an‘optic nerve’ and another such retina at the place of reproduction. These tworetinas were to be constructed after the fashion of a checkerboard with manyseparate little sections, and the so-called optic nerve was nothing more than apart of the earth.An invention of mine enables me to transmit simultaneously, and without anyinterference whatsoever, hundreds of thousands of distinct impulses through theground just as though I had so many separate wires. I did not contemplate usingany moving part – a scanning apparatus or a cathodic ray, which is a sort ofmoving device, the use of which I suggested in one of my lectures.Now if it be true that a thought reflects an image on the retina, it is a merequestion of illuminating the same property and taking photographs, and thenusing the ordinary methods which are available to project the image on a screen.If this can be done successfully, then the objects imagined by a person would beclearly reflected on the screen as they are formed, and in this way everythought of the individual could be read. Our minds would then, indeed, be likeopen books.As always, he claimed to have discovered a new source of power. He was not readyto go into details. He had to check his findings before they could be formallyannounced. But he had been working the underlying principles for many years.From the practical point of view, his generator would require a huge initialinvestment, but once a machine was installed it would work indefinitely and thecost of operation would be next to nothing.But this time he gave more details. The design was relatively simple – ‘just abig mass of steel, copper and aluminium, comprising a stationary and rotatingpart, peculiarly assembled’. The electricity would then be distributed longdistances by his AC system which, he said, already distributed 30 millionhorsepower of waterpower, and there were projects then going on all over theworld which would double that amount.‘Unfortunately, there is not enough water power to satisfy the present needs,’he said, ‘and everywhere inventors and engineers are endeavouring to unlock someadditional store of energy.’ The Formula for a Long LifeIn his eighth decade, Tesla still expected to live a long time and reflected onlife and longevity.Quite early in life I set about disciplining myself, planning out a programme ofliving for what I considered the most sane and worthwhile life. Since I love mywork above all things, it is only natural that I should wish to continue ituntil I die. I want no vacation – no surcease from my labours. If people wouldselect a life work compatible with their temperaments, the sum total ofhappiness would be immeasurably increased in the world.Many are saddened and depressed by the brevity of life. ‘What is the use ofattempting to accomplish anything?’ they say. ‘Life is so short. We may neverlive to see the completion of the task.’ Well, people could prolong their livesconsiderably if they would but make the effort. Human beings do so many thingsthat pave the way to an early grave.First of all, we eat too much, but this we have heard said often before. And weeat the wrong kinds of foods and drink the wrong kinds of liquids. Most of theharm is done by overeating and under-exercising, which bring about toxicconditions in the body and make it impossible to throw off the accumulatedpoisons.My regime for the good life and my diet? Well, for one thing, I drink plenty ofmilk and water. Why overburden the bodies that serve us? I eat but two meals aday, and I avoid all acid-producing foods. Almost everyone eats too many peasand beans and other foods containing uric acid and other poisons. I partakeliberally of fresh vegetables, fish and meat sparingly, and rarely. Fish isreputed as fine brain food, but has a very strong acid reaction, as it containsa great deal of phosphorus. Acidity is by far the worst enemy to fight off inold age.Potatoes are splendid, and should be eaten at least once a day. They containvaluable mineral salts and are neutralizing. I believe in plenty of exercise. Iwalk 8 or 10 miles every day, and never take a cab or other conveyances when Ihave the time to use leg power. I also exercise in my bath daily, for I thinkthat this is of great importance. I take a warm bath, followed by a prolongedcold shower.Sleep? I scarcely ever sleep. I come of a long-lived family, but it is noted forits poor sleepers. I expect to match the records of my ancestors and live to beat least 100. My sleeplessness does not worry me. Sometimes I doze for an houror so. Occasionally, however, once in a few months, I may sleep for 4 or 5hours. Then I awaken virtually charged with energy, like a battery. Nothing canstop me after such a night. I feel great strength then. There is no doubt aboutit but that sleep is a restorer, a vitalizer, that it increases energy. But onthe other hand, I do not think it is essential to one’s well being, particularlyif one is habitually a poor sleeper.Today, at 77, as a result of a well-regulated life, sleeplessnessnotwithstanding, I have an excellent certificate of health. I never felt betterin my life. I am energetic, strong, in full possession of all my mentalfacilities. In my prime I did not possess the energy I have today. And what ismore, in solving my problems I use but a small part of the energy I possess, forI have learned how to conserve it. Because of my experience and knowledge gainedthrough the years, my tasks are much lighter. Contrary to general belief, workcomes easier for older people if they are in good health, because they havelearned through years of practice how to arrive at a given place by the shortestpath. Developing the Death RayTesla had inherited a deep hatred of war from his father. Throughout his life,he sought ways to end warfare. Short of that, he thought wars should be foughtout between machines. His idea for a death ray began back in the 1890s when heproduced a type of lamp which, with a beam of electrons, could vaporize zirconiaor diamonds. And in 1915, he talked of beaming energy from Wardenclyffe, thatwould ‘paralyze or kill’.In World War I, British inventor Harry Grindell-Matthews claimed to haveinvented a ‘diabolical ray’ that could be used against zeppelins. In the early1920s, both the British and the French governments showed an interest. In 1924,he went to New York where he met Hugo Gernsback and, probably, Tesla. However,Gernsback and Professor W. Severinghouse, a physicist from Columbia University,tried unsuccessfully to duplicate his findings. Not to be outdone, the Germansand the Soviets both claimed to have developed beams that could bring downplanes.But, Tesla was not convinced. In 1934, he said: ‘It is impossible to developsuch a ray. I worked on that idea for many years before my ignorance wasdispelled and I became convinced that it could not be realized.’He was working on something that he said was entirely different. ‘This new beamof mine consists of minute bullets moving at a terrific speed, and any amount ofpower desired can be transmitted by them. The whole plant is just a gun, but onewhich is incomparably superior to the present.’The war clouds were gathering over Europe again and, on 11 July 1934, The NewYork Times carried the headline on its front page, reading: Tesla, at 78, BaresNew ‘Death Beam’. Tesla said his new invention ‘will send concentrated beams ofparticles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bringdown a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 250 miles (400 km) froma defending nation’s borders and will cause armies of millions to drop dead intheir tracks’.The death beam would operate silently at distances as far as you could see witha telescope and limited only by the curvature of the Earth. It would beinvisible and leave no marks beyond the evidence of its destruction. An army ofa million men would be annihilated in a second and, even with the most powerfulmicroscope, it would not be possible to see what had caused their deaths.It would also be the perfect defence against bombing. ‘The flying machine hascompletely demoralized the world,’ he wrote, ‘so much that in some cities, asLondon and Paris, people are in mortal fear of aerial bombing. The new means Ihave perfected afford absolute protection against this and other forms ofattack.’Tesla said that his death beam would make war impossible by offering everycountry an ‘invisible Chinese Wall, only a million times more impenetrable’. Itwould make every nation impregnable to attack by aeroplanes or large invadingarmies.While making every nation safe from invasion, Tesla said they could not be usedas offensive weapons as the death beam ‘could be generated only from large,stationary and immovable power plants, stationed in the manner of old-time fortsat various strategic distances from each country’s border … they could not bemoved for purposes of attack’.However, he admitted that smaller generating plants could be mounted onbattleships with enough power to destroy incoming aircraft – re-establishing thesuperiority of the battleship over the aeroplane again. Submarines could alsobecome obsolete, he said, as methods of detecting them had been perfected to thepoint where there was no point in submerging. Once a submarine had been located,the death beam could be employed as it would work underwater, though not as wellas in air.Elsewhere he proclaimed that the battleship was doomed. ‘What happened to thearmoured knight will also happen to the armoured vessel,’ he said. The moneyspent on battleships ‘should be directed in channels that will improve thewelfare of the country’. Manifestations of EnergyThe production of the death beam involved four new inventions of Tesla’s, thoughhe would not provide details of these until they had been submitted to theproper scientific authorities. However, he said, the first invention was anapparatus for producing rays and ‘other manifestations of energy in free air’,eliminating the high vacuum necessary at present for the production of such raysand beams. The second was a new method for producing a very great electricalforce. The third was a method for amplifying this and the fourth, he said, was‘a new method for producing a tremendous electrical repelling force’. AgainTesla was looking at a potential of 50 million volts which would catapultmicroscopic particles of matter towards the target. He reckoned that it wouldcost no more than $2 million and take only three months to build.‘All my inventions are at the service of the United States government,’ he said.Should the government take him up on his offer, he said he would go to work atonce and keep on going until he collapsed. However, he added: ‘I would have toinsist on one condition – I would not suffer interference from any experts. Theywould have to trust me.’In the New York Herald journalist Joseph Alsop described the progress Tesla wasmaking developing his death ray:He illustrated the sort of thing that the particles will be by recalling anincident that occurred often enough when he was experimenting with a cathodetube. Then, sometimes, a particle larger than an electron, but still very tiny,would break off from the cathode, pass out of the tube and hit him. He said hecould feel a sharp, stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at theplace where it passed out. The particles in the beam of force, ammunition whichthe operators of the generating machine will have to supply, will travel farfaster than such particles as broke off from the cathode, and they will travelin concentrations, he said.As Dr Tesla explained it, the tremendous speed of the particles will give themtheir destruction-dealing qualities. All but the thickest armoured surfacesconfronting them would be melted through in an instant by the heat generated inthe concussion. Such beams or rays of particles now known to science arecomposed always of fragments of atoms, whereas, according to Dr Tesla, his wouldbe of microscopic dust of a suitable sort.The chief differentiation between his and the present rays would appear to be,however, that his are produced in free air instead of in a vacuum tube. Thevacuum tube rays have been projected out into the air, but there they travelonly a few inches, and they are capable only of causing burns or slightdisintegration of objects which they strike.Tesla tried to get Jack Morgan to finance a prototype of his invention, butMorgan was unconvinced. He tried to deal directly with the British, to no avail.Frustrated, he sent an elaborate technical paper, including diagrams, to anumber of nations including the US, Canada, Britain, France, the Soviet Unionand Yugoslavia. Called ‘The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-DispersiveEnergy Through Natural Media’, the paper provided the first technicaldescription of a charged particle beam weapon. And it was not just fantasy.Tesla had solved one of the key problems of a death ray – how to operate avacuum chamber with one end open to the atmosphere. He achieved this bydirecting a high-velocity stream of air at the tip of his gun to maintain‘dynamic seal’. This would be provided by a large Tesla turbine.Interest came from the Soviet Union and, in 1937, Tesla presented a plan to theAmtorg Trading Corporation, in New York City, which handled trade with theSoviet Union. Two years later, in 1939, part of the prototype was tested in theUSSR and Tesla received a payment of $25,000. But by then, the Soviet Union hadallied itself with Nazi Germany.While Tesla’s death beam did not see the light of day in World War II, duringthe Cold War both the US and the Soviet Union worked on charged particle beams. Resembling Dr FrankensteinTesla made a further move into science fiction when the 1931 horror classicFrankenstein used Tesla Coils to make lightning flashes. Much of the equipmentused by Dr Frankenstein bears an uncanny resemblance to the apparatus Teslainvented for his experiments. Indeed, Tesla favoured the movie’s producer CarlLaemmle as he fought patent battles with Edison when establishing UniversalPictures.In 1935, one of Tesla’s electrical extravaganzas was filmed by a newsreel cameraman and offered to Paramount, but they found the subject too technical.Nevertheless Hugo Gernsback and Frank Paul continued to use Tesla’s ideas intheir sci-fi comics.Meanwhile Tesla went about work on his death ray in a secret laboratory underthe Fifty-ninth Street Bridge. One of his other inventions of the period was awooden birdcage, complete with birdbath. Western Union boys were despatched withthese to rescue injured pigeons from around New York Public Library, Bryant Parkand St Patrick’s Cathedral. Tainted with Anti-SemitismTesla also had ties with a Hungarian architect named Titus deBobula, possiblythrough the Puskás brothers. deBobula borrowed money from the inventor as earlyas 1900. In 1908, he married the niece of Pittsburgh steel magnate CharlesSchwab (1862 – 1939). deBobula then designed and built Schwab’s new mansion andborrowed money from him for a number of real estate ventures. He offered to findthe backing to rebuild Wardenclyffe, but deBobula’s ventures turned sour. Hefell out with Schwab and became an anarchist. Back in Budapest, he joined apro-Hitler group and wrote a paper denouncing ‘Jewish physics’ as the Nazisdubbed the new departures into relativity and quantum physics. Echoes ofanti-Semitism can be found in Tesla’s attacks on Einstein.Returning to the US, deBobula designed a 120-ft (36-m) tower for Tesla’s deathbeam. However, his involvement with a munitions company run by a German-Americanbrought him to the attention of the IRS and the FBI. When his apartment wassearched it was found to be full of grenades, tear-gas bombs and dynamite. Teslawas furious when deBobula used his name in an arms deal with Paraguay.Questioned by the authorities, deBobula denied any ties to the Communist Partyor the German-American Bund which supported Hitler. The FBI monitored hisactivities throughout World War II. Nothing was ever proved against him.However, Tesla was tainted by association. Reviewing His Greatest InventionsThe following year Tesla was still full of wild and abstruse pronouncements. Heinvited some 30 journalists to a gourmet luncheon to celebrate his 79th birthdayin the private dining room of the Hotel New Yorker, where he was then staying.He had been thrown out of the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930, owing $2,000, whenother patrons complained of the pigeon droppings. While the reporters feasted athis expense, Tesla did not even touch a glass of water. However, towards the endof the meal, he went and got a small bottle of pasteurized milk which he pouredinto a silver dish and heated on a small oil stove beside the table. The HotelNew Yorker then supplied a birthday cake with one candle for their honouredguest.Asked what was his greatest feat in the field of engineering, he said: ‘Anapparatus by which mechanical energy can be transmitted to any part of theterrestrial globe.’He called this discovery ‘tele-geo-dynamics’ and admitted that it would ‘appearalmost preposterous’. However, it would give the world a new means of unfailingcommunication, provide a new and by far the safest means for guiding ships atsea and into port, furnish a ‘divining rod’ for locating any type of ore beneaththe surface of the Earth, and give scientists a means of ‘laying bare thephysical conditions of the Earth and enable them to determine all the Earth’sphysical constants’.The apparatus needed to do this, he said, was simple. It consisted of astationary part and a cylinder of fine steel ‘floating’ in the air. He had, hesaid, discovered a means of ‘impressing on the floating part powerful impulseswhich react on the stationary part, and through the latter to transmit energythrough the Earth’. To do this he had ‘found a new amplifier for a known type ofenergy’. The purpose was ‘to produce impulses through the Earth and then pickthem up whenever needed’.His second greatest invention, he said, ‘will be considered absolutelyimpossible by any competent electrical engineer’. It was a new method ofproducing direct current without a commutator – something, he said, ‘that hasbeen considered impossible since the days of Faraday’.‘Incredible as it seems,’ he said, ‘I have found a solution for this oldproblem.’Next he came to cosmic rays which, he said, were produced by the force ofelectrostatic repulsion and consisted of powerfully charged positive particlesthat come to Earth from the Sun and other stars. ‘After experimentation,’ hesaid, ‘the Sun is charged with an electrical potential of 215 billion volts,while the electric charge stored in the Sun amounted to around 50 billionbillion electrostatic units.’Again he dismissed the theory of relativity, describing it as ‘a mass of errorand deceptive ideas violently opposed to the teachings of great men of scienceand even to common sense’.The theory, wraps all these errors and fallacies and clothes them in magnificentmathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to theunderlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorantpeople take for a king. Its exponents are brilliant men, but they aremetaphysicists rather than scientists. Not a single one of the relativitypropositions has been proved.One of Tesla’s great bugbears with relativity was its prohibition of anythingtravelling faster than the speed of light, which upset his theories aboutstanding waves and the wireless transmission of energy. He was adamant that, inhis observations of cosmic rays, he had already discovered particles thattravelled faster than light.In 1899, I obtained mathematical and experimental proofs that the Sun, and otherheavenly bodies similarly conditioned, emit rays of great energy which consistof inconceivably small particles animated by velocities vastly exceeding that oflight. So great is the penetrative power of these rays that they can traversethousands of miles of solid matter with but slight diminution of velocity. Inpassing through space, which is filled with cosmic dust, they generated asecondary radiation of constant intensity, day and night, and pouring upon theearth equally from all directions. As the primary rays projected from the sunsand stars can pass through distances measured in light-years without greatdiminution of velocity, it follows that whether a secondary ray is generatednear a sun or at any distance from it, however great, its intensity is the same.As of yet, no one else has found particles that travel faster than light.However, neutrinos generated by the fusion reactions in the Sun do have thepenetrative power Tesla mentioned. They were predicted by the Italian-bornphysicist Enrico Fermi (1901 – 54) in 1934, but not detected experimentally foranother 20 years. Nevertheless in 1932, Tesla said that he had ‘harnessed thecosmic rays and caused them to operate a motive device’. Cosmic rays, he said,struck the atmosphere, ionizing the air and creating charged particles – ionsand electrons. ‘These charges are captured in a condenser which is made todischarge through the circuit of a motor,’ he said. He also said that he had‘hopes of building such a motor on a large scale’. However, by 1935, he was alsotelling the New York Herald Tribune that some day the Sun would explode. The Tesla InstituteIn 1936, the Tesla Institute was opened in Belgrade, then the capital ofYugoslavia. A fully equipped research centre, it was funded by the Yugoslavgovernment and private sources. A week of celebrations commemorating the greatman’s 80th birthday followed. They occurred in Belgrade on 26, 27 and 28 May, inZagreb, capital of Croatia, on 30 May and in his native village of Smiljan on 2June, and again on 12 July 1936."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 15 – The Final Days What has the future in store for this strange being, born of a breath, ofperishable tissue, yet Immortal, with his powers fearful and Divine? What magicwill be wrought by him in the end? What is to be his greatest deed, his crowningachievement?Nikola Tesla At 81, Tesla was honoured by both the Yugoslav and Czechoslovakian governments.He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the White Eagle, Yugoslavia’s highest honourbestowed by King Peter through his regent Prince Paul, and Czechoslovakia’sOrder of the White Lion. These were presented at his birthday luncheon at theHotel New Yorker. Meanwhile he was still making his birthday announcements ofnew discoveries to newspapermen.In 1937, he told them that he had perfected the principle of a new tube thatwould make it possible to smash atoms and produce cheap radium. He would give ademonstration of it in ‘only a little time’. He was expecting to put hisdiscovery forward for France’s Pierre Guzman Prize of 100,000 francs (around€50,000). It was awarded by the Académie des Sciences to ‘the person of whatevernation who will find the means … of communicating with a star and of receiving aresponse’.The money, of course, is a trifling consideration, but for the great historicalhonour of being the first to achieve this miracle I would be almost willing togive my life. I am just as sure that prize will be awarded to me as if I alreadyhad it in my pocket. They have got to do it. It means it will be possible toconvey several thousand units of horsepower to other planets, regardless ofdistance. This discovery of mine will be remembered when everything else I havedone is covered in dust.[The Guzman Prize was finally awarded to the crew of Apollo 11 in 1969 after thefirst Moon landing.]His apparatus, Tesla said, employed more than three dozen of his own inventions.‘It is absolutely developed,’ he said. ‘I wouldn’t be surer that I can transmitenergy a hundred miles than I am of the fact that I can transmit energy amillion miles up.’It used a different kind of energy than was commonly employed which travelsthrough a channel of ‘less than one-half of one-millionth of a centimetre’. ‘Icould undertake a contract to manufacture the apparatus,’ he said.While he was certain that there was life on other planets, the problem with hisequipment, he said, was hitting other moving planets with a needle-point oftremendous energy. But he thought that astronomers could help solve thisproblem. First they should aim this Tesla Ray at the Moon where they couldeasily see its effects – ‘the splash and the volatilization of matter’. He alsoimagined advanced thinkers living on other planets were experimenting in thisfield, mistaking Tesla energy rays for cosmic rays.On the practical front, he announced a new type of tube. His experiments hadbeen rewarded with ‘complete success’ and he had ‘produced a tube which it willbe hard to improve further’.It is of ideal simplicity, not subject to wear and can be operated at anypotential, however high – even 100 million volts – that can be produced. It willcarry heavy currents, transform any amount of energy within practical limits andit permits easy control and regulation of the same. I expect that thisinvention, when it becomes known, will be universally adopted in preference toother forms of tubes and that it will be the means of obtaining resultsundreamed of before. Among others, it will enable the production of cheap radiumsubstitutes in any desired quantity and will be, in general, immediately moreeffective in the smashing of atoms and the transmutation of matter. However,this tube will not open up a way to utilize atomic or subatomic energy for powerpurposes. It will cheapen radium so that it will be just as cheap – well, itwill get down to $1 a pound – in any quantity.Tesla was annoyed that some newspapers said he would be giving a fulldescription of his invention at his birthday lunch. He could not release theinformation, he said, because he was bound by financial obligations involving‘vast sums of money’. And this was not an idle boast, he insisted: ‘It is not anexperiment. I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will passbefore I can give it to the world.’The New York Times, perhaps with tongue in cheek, went on to report that DrTesla entertained his guests with colourful personal reminiscences andobservations including his opinions on dieting and immortality. More Money WorriesAlthough Tesla’s mind was as fertile as ever, his financial situation continuedto decline. When Hugo Gernsback showed him Westinghouse’s latest radio set,Tesla saw immediately that they were flagrantly infringing his wireless patents.He protested, but was in no position to fight a large corporation.Unable to pay his hotel bill, again, Tesla handed over the ‘working model’ ofhis death beam as collateral. It was worth, he said, $10,000. He also told JackMorgan that the Russians were keen to buy his death beam to defend themselvesagainst the Japanese. However, he already owed Morgan a great deal of money overhis bladeless turbines and, despite filling his letters with attacks on FranklinRoosevelt’s ‘New Deal’ with Astor who Morgan hated, no money was forthcoming.Eventually, Westinghouse acknowledged Tesla’s contribution to the company andpaid him $125 a month as a consulting engineer. They also came to an agreementwith the Hotel New Yorker where Tesla lived rent free for the rest of his life.In his last years, the Yugoslav government also gave him an honorarium of $7,200a year. This allowed him to give generous tips to those who had rendered him theslightest assistance and hand-outs, that he could ill-afford, to anyone hethought was in need. Tesla’s Last InterviewsTesla gave some of his last interviews to Nazi apologist George S. Viereck[chapter-29.xhtml#b113]. Again he explained that he was not a believer in God inthe conventional sense. Perhaps under Viereck’s influence, Tesla espousedeugenics – the forced sterilization of those thought to be mentally unfit –which were then being practised in the US as well as Nazi Germany.The year 2100 will see eugenics universally established. In past ages, the lawgoverning the survival of the fittest roughly weeded out the less desirablestrains. Then man’s new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthlessworkings of nature. As a result, we continue to keep alive and to breed theunfit. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the raceis to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberateguidance of the mating instinct. Several European countries and a number ofstates of the American Union sterilize the criminal and the insane. This is notsufficient. The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriagemore difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should bepermitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to anormal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitualcriminal.Although at the time, the environment was hardly on the agenda, Tesla toldViereck:Hygiene, physical culture will be recognized branches of education andgovernment. The Secretary of Hygiene or Physical Culture will be far moreimportant in the cabinet of the President of the United States who holds officein the year 2035 than the Secretary of War. The pollution of our beaches such asexists today around New York City will seem as unthinkable to our children andgrandchildren as life without plumbing seems to us. Our water supply will be farmore carefully supervised, and only a lunatic will drink unsterilized water.He looked forward to a time where science and education would be more importantthan war:Today the most civilized countries of the world spend a maximum of their incomeon war and a minimum on education. The 21st century will reverse this order. Itwill be more glorious to fight against ignorance than to die on the field ofbattle. The discovery of a new scientific truth will be more important than thesquabbles of diplomats. Even the newspapers of our own day are beginning totreat scientific discoveries and the creation of fresh philosophical concepts asnews. The newspapers of the 21st century will give a mere ‘stick’ in the backpages to accounts of crime or political controversies, but will headline on thefront pages the proclamation of a new scientific hypothesis.Now gaunt from his meagre diet, he had clear views on the future of food:More people die or grow sick from polluted water than from coffee, tea, tobacco,and other stimulants. I myself eschew all stimulants. I also practically abstainfrom meat. I am convinced that within a century, coffee, tea, and tobacco willno longer be in vogue. Alcohol, however, will still be used. It is not astimulant but a veritable elixir of life. The abolition of stimulants will notcome about forcibly. It will simply be no longer fashionable to poison thesystem with harmful ingredients. [Bodybuilder] Bernarr Macfadden has shown howit is possible to provide palatable food based upon natural products such asmilk, honey, and wheat. I believe that the food which is served today in hispenny restaurants will be the basis of epicurean meals in the smartest banquethalls of the 21st century.There will be enough wheat and wheat products to feed the entire world,including the teeming millions of China and India, now chronically on the vergeof starvation. The earth is bountiful, and where her bounty fails, nitrogendrawn from the air will refertilize her womb. I developed a process for thispurpose in 1900. It was perfected 14 years later under the stress of war byGerman chemists.After subsisting on a diet of bread, warm milk and what he called ‘FactorActus’, Tesla gave up solid food altogether, living on thin gruel ofcauliflower, leeks, cabbage, turnips and lettuce. But he was still strong enoughto make predictions. Then, in his last days, he lived on milk and honey,believing them to be the purest foods. Nevertheless, the future looked bright:Long before the next century dawns, systematic reforestation and the scientificmanagement of natural resources will have made an end of all devastatingdroughts, forest fires, and floods. The universal utilization of water power andits long-distance transmission will supply every household with cheap power andwill dispense with the necessity of burning fuel. The struggle for existencebeing lessened, there should be development along ideal rather than materiallines.What’s more, the work would be done by robots, something Tesla had been workingon for nearly 40 years.At present we suffer from the derangement of our civilization because we havenot yet completely adjusted ourselves to the machine age. The solution of ourproblems does not lie in destroying but in mastering the machine.Innumerable activities still performed by human hands today will be performed byautomatons. At this very moment scientists working in the laboratories ofAmerican universities are attempting to create what has been described as a‘thinking machine’. I anticipated this development.I actually constructed ‘robots’. Today the robot is an accepted fact, but theprinciple has not been pushed far enough. In the 21st century the robot willtake the place which slave labour occupied in ancient civilization. There is noreason at all why most of this should not come to pass in less than a century,freeing mankind to pursue its higher aspirations. Fragments of Olympian GossipUnder the influence of Viereck, Tesla, who was always competitive, wrote a poemcall Fragments of Olympian Gossip, poking fun at the scientific establishment:While listening on my cosmic phoneI caught words from the Olympus blown.A newcomer was shown around;That much I could guess, aided by sound.There’s Archimedes with his leverStill busy on problems as ever.Says: matter and force are transmutableAnd wrong the laws you thought immutable.Below, on Earth, they work at full blastAnd news are coming in thick and fast.The latest tells of a cosmic gun.To be pelted is very poor fun.We are wary with so much at stake,Those beggars are a pest – no mistake.Too bad, Sir Isaac, they dimmed your renownAnd turned your great science upside down.Now a long haired crank, Einstein by name,Puts on your high teaching all the blame.Says: matter and force are transmutableAnd wrong the laws you thought immutable.I am much too ignorant, my son,For grasping schemes so finely spun.My followers are of stronger mindAnd I am content to stay behind,Perhaps I failed, but I did my best,These masters of mine may do the rest.Come, Kelvin, I have finished my cup.When is your friend Tesla coming up.Oh, quoth Kelvin, he is always late,It would be useless to remonstrate.Then silence – shuffle of soft slippered feet –I knock and – the bedlam of the street. World War IITesla was growing feeble, but with the help of his nephew Sava Kosanovic hewrote a foreword to a Serbo-Croat edition of The Future of the Common Man by thethen Vice-President Henry Wallace (1888 – 1965). In it, he said: ‘Out of thiswar, the greatest since the beginning of history, a new world must be born thatwould justify the sacrifices offered by humanity, where there will be nohumiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich; where the products ofintellect, science and art will serve society for the betterment andbeautification of life, and not the individuals for achieving wealth. This newworld shall be a world of free men and free nations, equal in dignity andrespect.’While the regent of Yugoslavia, Prince Paul (1893 – 1976), sought to make atreaty with the Nazis, King Peter (1923 – 70) opposed it. When he came of age at17, Germany invaded and the king went into exile. Sava Kosanovic went with him.However, he began to favour the Communist guerrilla leader Josip Broz Tito (1892– 1980), who the British and Americans were also reluctantly backing. However,in the US, Kosanovic brought King Peter to Tesla’s hotel. In his diary KingPeter wrote:I visited Dr Nikola Tesla, the world-famous Yugoslav-American scientist, in hisapartment in the Hotel New Yorker. After I had greeted him the aged scientistsaid: ‘It is my greatest honour. I am glad you are in your youth, and I amcontent that you will be a great ruler. I believe I will live until you comeback to a free Yugoslavia. From your father you have received his last words:“Guard Yugoslavia.” I am proud to be a Serbian and a Yugoslav. Our people cannotperish. Preserve the unity of all Yugoslavs – the Serbs, the Croats and theSlovenes.’The two of them wept over the fate of their homeland. Generous to the EndAlthough Tesla was dogged by his own financial problems, he was generous to theend. A few days before he died, he called one of his favourite messenger boys, alad named Kerrigan, and gave him an envelope, addressed to: Mr Samuel Clemens,35 South Fifth Avenue, New York City. He told him it was to be delivered asquickly as possible. After a while the boy returned, saying that there was nosuch street as South Fifth Avenue. Tesla was furious. Mr Clemens was a veryfamous author who wrote under the name of Mark Twain, he told Kerrigan, and theaddress he had given was correct.Kerrigan tried again. And when he had no luck he reported to his office manager,who quickly spotted the boy’s difficulty. South Fifth Avenue had changed itsname to West Broadway years before and Mark Twain had been dead over 30 years.The address Tesla had given him was that of his laboratory that had burnt down.Kerrigan returned to Tesla to explain his difficulties. Tesla was outraged whenthe boy told him that Mark Twain was dead. ‘He was in my room here last night,’Tesla insisted. ‘He is having financial difficulties and needs my help.’ And hesent the boy to deliver the envelope again. Confused Kerrigan returned to hismanager who opened the envelope to see whether it contained any clue to where itshould be delivered. All that was inside was a blank piece of paper and $100 in$5 bills. When Kerrigan returned the envelope to Tesla yet again, the inventortold him that, if he could not deliver the money, he should keep it.At the same time, while Tesla could not pay the $297 for his possessions thatwere being kept in storage, he sent a cheque for $500 to a Serbian Church inGary, Indiana. Tesla’s biographer John J. O’Neill saw an advertisement forTesla’s possessions that were being sold off by the storage company to cover thebill and contacted the inventor’s nephew Sava Kosanovic who paid the bill,preventing the loss of Tesla’s priceless papers. The Slight Hint of a SmileDuring the latter part of 1942, Tesla became practically a recluse. Physicallyweak, he retired to bed and permitted no visitors. Hotel staff were not to visithis room unless he summoned them and he refused to listen to any suggestion thatthey call a doctor. On 5 January 1943, he called a maid to his room and issuedorders that he was not to be disturbed. Nothing was heard from him for threedays. Finally the maid decided to risk his wrath and check up on him. Sheentered the room in trepidation and found him dead, with the slight hint of asmile on his gaunt face.As he had died alone without medical attention, the police were called. TheMedical Examiner put the time of death as 10.30 pm on Thursday 7 January, just afew hours before the maid’s early morning visit. Tesla had died in his sleep.The cause of death was given as coronary thrombosis and the Medical Examinernoted that there were ‘No suspicious circumstances.’Agents from the FBI came to open the safe in Tesla’s room and read his papers incase there was anything in them that might aid the war effort. However, HugoGernsback, Kenneth Swezey, Sava Kosanovic and George Clark of RCA had alreadyentered the apartment. While Gernsback went to organize a death mask, the otherthree had the safe opened by a locksmith with representatives of the hotelmanagement present. The FBI said that valuable papers were taken. However, thehotel management said that Kosanovic only took three pictures and Swezey tookthe testimonial book created for Tesla’s 75th birthday. However, Kosanovic wassure that someone had already gone through his uncle’s effects. Technical paperswere missing, along with a black notebook he knew that Tesla kept. It containedseveral hundred pages of notes, some of which were marked ‘government’. State FuneralThe Yugoslav ambassador Dr Constantin Fotitch laid on a state funeral for Teslaat the Cathedral of St John the Divine. Over 2,000 mourners were present,including other inventors. While the church was Episcopalian, the service wasOrthodox and conducted in Serbian. The honorary pallbearers included Dr ErnstAlexanderson of General Electric who patented a high-frequency transmitter,Edwin Armstrong [chapter-29.xhtml#b115], father of FM radio, Gano Dunn,president of J.G. White Engineering who had been Tesla’s assistant at hisground-breaking lecture at Columbia, and representatives from Westinghouse,Columbia University and the Hayden Planetarium where Tesla would often go tomeditate. A number of Yugoslav ministers were there. King Peter II of Yugoslaviasent a wreath and the chief mourner was Tesla’s nephew Sava Kosanovic, who wasby then president of the Eastern and Central European Planning Board,representing Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Greece. Later he becameYugoslav ambassador to the US.Scientists paid tribute to his intellect and technological achievements, andtelegrams of condolence came from Nobel Prize winners, prominent scientists,literary figures and US officials. A message from Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt read:‘The President and I are deeply sorry to hear of the death of Mr Nikola Tesla.We are grateful for his contribution to science and industry and to thiscountry.’Vice-President Henry Wallace paid a more personal tribute: ‘Nikola Tesla,Yugoslav born, so lived his life as to make it an outstanding example of thatpower that makes the United States not merely an English-speaking nation but anation with universal appeal. In Nikola Tesla’s death the common man loses oneof his best friends.’Over the radio New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia (1882 – 1947) read a eulogywritten by Slovene author Louis Adamic. After the service, Tesla’s body wastaken to Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, and was later cremated. Tributes to TeslaTesla had always been loved by the popular press for his shocking experimentsand outrageous pronouncements. On his death, the New York Sun wrote:Mr Tesla was 86 years old when he died. He died alone. He was an eccentric,whatever that means. A non-conformist, possibly. At any rate, he would leave hisexperiments and go for a time to feed the silly and inconsequential pigeons inHerald Square. He delighted in talking nonsense; or was it? Granting that he wasa difficult man to deal with, and that sometimes his predictions would affrontthe ordinary human’s intelligence, here, still, was an extraordinary man ofgenius. He must have been. He was seeing a glimpse into that confused andmysterious frontier which divides the known and the unknown ... But today we doknow that Tesla, the ostensibly foolish old gentleman at times was trying withsuperb intelligence to find the answers. Probably we shall appreciate him bettera few million years from now.More tributes came rolling in. Hugo Gernsback wrote: ‘We cannot know, but it maybe that a long time from now, when patterns have changed, the critics will takea view of history. They will bracket Tesla with Da Vinci, or with our own MrFranklin … One thing is sure. The world, as we run it today, did not appreciatehis peculiar greatness.’The President of RCA David Sarnoff said: ‘Nikola Tesla’s achievements inelectrical science are monuments that symbolize America as a land of freedom andopportunity … His novel ideas of getting the ether in vibration put him on thefrontier of wireless. Tesla’s mind was a human dynamo that whirled to benefitmankind.’Edwin Armstrong, who went on to sue RCA for infringing his patents, said:Who today can read a copy of The Inventions, Researches and Writings of NikolaTesla, published before the turn-of-the-century, without being fascinated by thebeauty of the experiments described and struck with admiration for Tesla’sextraordinary insight into the nature of the phenomena with which he wasdealing? Who now can realize the difficulties he must have had to overcome inthose early days? But one can imagine the inspirational effect of the book 40years ago on a boy about to decide to study the electrical art. Its effect wasboth profound and decisive.Nine months after Tesla’s death the USS Nikola Tesla – a Liberty ship, vital tothe Allied war effort – was launched in Baltimore. The Missing PapersThe papers from the safe in Tesla’s room were lodged with the Office of AlienProperty. This was unusual as Tesla was a US citizen. The day after Tesla diedAbraham N. Spanel, the designer of floating pontoon stretchers, got in touchwith FBI agent Fredrich Cornels about the Tesla papers, fearing that, viaKosanovic, they might fall into Communist hands. Before he had started theInternational Latex Company of Dover, Delaware (who later made space suits),Spanel had worked as an electrical engineer and considered that some of Tesla’sunmade inventions might play a vital role in the war. He made waves in highplaces, contacting others in the White House and the FBI.Spanel also got in touch with the young electrical engineer Bloyce Fitzgeraldwho had also contacted Cornels. Fitzgerald had been writing to Tesla for sometime. Finally he got to meet Tesla just a few weeks before his death. At thetime, Fitzgerald was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology working on the‘dissipation of energy from rapid-fire weapons’. Around the same time Tesla hadcomplained that someone had been trying to steal his invention. His room hadbeen entered and his papers examined, but ‘the spies had left empty handed,’ hesaid.Fitzgerald told Cornels that, among Tesla’s papers, were complete plans for hisdeath beam, along with specifications and explanations of how the thing worked.There was also ‘a working model … which cost more than $10,000 to build in asafety deposit box of Tesla’s at the Governor Clinton Hotel’.Charles Hausler, one of Tesla’s pigeon handlers, also said that Tesla kept alarge box in his room near his pigeon cages. ‘He told me to be very careful notto disturb the box as it contained something that could destroy an airplane inthe sky and he had hopes of presenting it to the world,’ Hausler said. Trunks Full of Alien PropertyAccording to Fitzgerald, Tesla had claimed that he had some 80 trunks in variousplaces around the city. It was vital for the war effort that the government gettheir hands on the Tesla papers. He also expressed doubts about the loyalty ofnephews Sava Kosanovic and Nicholas Trbojevich. There was even talk of havingKosanovic and Swezey arrested for theft, but as the papers were now with theOffice of Alien Property, this seemed unnecessary.Cornels’ boss P.E. Foxworth, assistant director of the New York FBI office, wascalled in to investigate. The government, he said, was ‘vitally interested’ inpreserving Tesla’s papers.The legality of the OAP holding onto Tesla’s papers was questionable. Althoughlegal title had fallen to Kosanovic, who was a foreigner, the government agencywas not permitted to seize ‘enemy assets’ without a court order. NeverthelessAlien Property custodian Irving Jurow got a call ordering him to impound all ofTesla’s belongings as he was reputed to have invented a death ray thatdisintegrated enemy planes in the sky and German agents were after it. Alongwith agents from Naval Intelligence, Army Intelligence and the FBI, Jurowvisited the Hotel New Yorker, the Governor Clinton, the St Regis, theWaldorf-Astoria and the storage facility where Tesla had kept the rest of histhings. Papers in possession of John J. O’Neill, who was preparing a biographyof Tesla, were also confiscated. These were perused by various branches of themilitary.Dr John G. Trump, an electrical engineer with the National Defense ResearchCommittee of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, was also calledto analyze the Tesla papers in OAP custody. Following a three-day investigation,Dr Trump concluded that Tesla’s ‘thoughts and efforts during at least the past15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhatpromotional character often concerned with the production and wirelesstransmission of power; but did not include new, sound, workable principles ormethods for realizing such results’. However, in his report, he admits that hehad not bothered to open many of the trunks, so confident was he that nothing ofvalue would be found. The Particle BeamHowever, among the papers was the still unpublished ‘The New Art of ProjectingConcentrated Non-Dispersive Energy Through Natural Media’. This was classifiedtop secret and distributed to Naval Intelligence, the National Defense ResearchCouncil, the FBI, MIT, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base – where the V1 flyingbomb was reverse engineered – and, probably, the White House.The paper described in detail the new features, including how to create anon-dispersive beam of particles:I perfected means for increasing enormously the intensity of the effects, butwas baffled in all my efforts to materially reduce dispersion and became fullyconvinced that this handicap could only be overcome by conveying the powerthrough the medium of small particles projected, at prodigious velocity, fromthe transmitter. Electro-static repulsion was the only means to this end andapparatus of stupendous force would have to be developed, but granted thatsufficient speed and energy could be realized with a single row of minute bodiesthen there would be no dispersion whatever even at great distance. Since thecross section of the carriers might be reduced to almost microscopic dimensionsan immense concentration of energy, irrespective of distance, could be attained.Then there was a diagram of the open-ended vacuum where, he said:It will be observed that in this tube I do away with the solid wall or windowindispensable in all types heretofore employed, producing the high vacuumrequired and preventing the inrush of the air by a gaseous jet of high velocity.Evidently, to secure this result, the dynamic pressure of the jet must be atleast equal to the external static pressure.The high-potential generator, creating a charge of up to 100 million volts,worked on the principle of a Van de Graaf generator – with the belt replaced bya high-speed stream of ionized air. The charges would be stored in speciallyshaped bulbs around the top of a 100 ft (30 m) tower. In the super-gun itself,tungsten wire would be fed into the high-vacuum firing chamber. Under the hugeelectrostatic forces generated, tiny droplets of metal would be sheared off andprojected out of the chamber at over 400,000 feet per second (120 km persecond).John Trump also went to the Hotel Governor Clinton to examine the working modelthat Tesla had said he left there. Tesla had told the management that the boxcontaining a secret weapon that was rigged to detonate if it was opened by anunauthorized person. Trump approached with trepidation. All he found inside was‘a multi-decade resistance box of the type used for Wheatstone bridge resistancemeasurements – a common standard item to be found in every electrical laboratorybefore the turn of the century’. Trump took no further interest. The Vanishing Death RayIn 1937, Tesla had claimed that he had built his death beam, saying: ‘It is notan experiment. I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time willpass before I can give it to the world.’ At the time, he did have two secretlabs where journalists were not allowed.Mrs Czito, whose husband’s father and grandfather both worked for Tesla, saidthat her father-in-law said Tesla had a device that could bounce a beam off theMoon. There is also a story that the deBobula design was taken to AlcoaAluminium who said they would furnish the material required once the capital hadbeen raised.There is, of course, a conspiracy theory to account for the missing model. Whenthe safe in Tesla’s room was opened, the locksmith was asked to change thecombination. Inside the safe, when it was locked again, was a set of keys andTesla’s 1917 Edison Medal. The new combination was given to Kosanovic and no oneelse. When the safe was finally shipped to Belgrade and opened some 10 yearslater, the medal and the keys were missing. The medal has never been found, butthe keys were found in one of the numerous cases of documents that accompaniedthe safe in the shipment.According to the Office of Alien Property, the two representatives of the hotelmanagement who were present were Mr L.O. Doty, credit manager, and Mr L.A.Fitzgerald, assistant credit manager. We have already met Bloyce Fitzgerald inconnection with Tesla, but Tesla’s biographer Marc Seifer has also unearthed aletter from a Colonel Ralph E. Doty, chief of the Washington Branch of theMilitary Intelligence Service. Dated 22 January 1946, it is addressed to theAlien Property Custodian and reads:Dear Sir: This office is in receipt of a communication from Headquarters, AirTechnical Service Command, Wright Field, requesting that we ascertain thewhereabouts of the files of the late scientist, Dr Nikola Tesla, which maycontain data of great value to the above Headquarters. It has been indicatedthat your office might have these files in custody. If this is true, we wouldlike to request your consent for a representative of the Air Technical ServiceCommand to review them. In view of the extreme importance of these files to theabove command, we would like to request that we be advised of any attempt by anyother agency to obtain them. Because of the urgency of this matter, thiscommunication will be delivered to you by a Liaison Officer of this office inthe hope of expediting the solicited information.If the Fitzgerald and Doty at the opening of the safe were government agents,they might easily have got hold of the combination and the keys. It seems thatSpanel was already under surveillance by the FBI for his pro-Communistsympathies. In November 1942, he met Fitzgerald at an engineering meeting,shortly before Tesla’s death. At the time Fitzgerald was an army private atWright Field. The FBI report later describes him as ‘a brilliant 20-year-oldscientist who spent hours with Tesla before his death … Fitzgerald had developedsome sort of anti-tank gun’. Spanel tried to form a partnership with Fitzgeraldto sell the weapon to the Remington Arms Company, but the deal fell through whena more lucrative offer came from the Eiogens Ship Building Company.Fitzgerald was fired by Eiogens in November 1943 and returned to Wright Field asa private. According to his FBI file, in 1945, he was ‘engaged in a highlysecret experimental project at Wright Field … In spite of his rank as private,Fitzgerald is actually director of this research and is working with many topyoung scientists … on the perfection of Tesla’s ‘death ray’ which inFitzgerald’s opinion is the only defence against the offensive use by anothernation of the atomic bomb.’The files that Colonel Doty requested did find their way to Wright Fieldbecause, on 24 October 1947, the Director of the Office of Alien Property wroteto the commanding officer of the Air Technical Service Command, asking for themback. The following month, a Colonel Duffy wrote back, saying: ‘These reportsare now in the possession of the Electronic Subdivision and are being evaluated.This should be completed by January 1, 1948. At that time your office will becontacted with respect to final disposition of these papers.’ Belgrade BoundIn 1946, Sava Kosanovic had become Yugoslavian ambassador to the US after the USrecognized Tito’s Communist government. But by 1950, he was still not allowedaccess to Tesla’s effects. He made official representations and in 1952, 80trunks containing Tesla’s papers, equipment and other belongings were shipped toBelgrade. Five years later, Tesla’s ashes followed. In the Tesla Museum theywere placed in a spherical urn as this was Tesla’s favourite shape.This did not stop American Scientist being interested in Tesla’s papers.Regularly individuals contacted the FBI who were thought to have made microfilmcopies of everything sent to Yugoslavia. In the 1970s, it was thought thatTesla’s fireballs might be a way of containing nuclear fusion. During the ColdWar, both sides again investigated the possibility of making a particle beam todisable incoming nuclear missiles. Naturally Tesla’s work would have been astarting point.In 1977, Aviation Week & Space Technology published an article called SovietsPush for Beam Weapon. In it, the retired head of Air Force Intelligence, GeneralGeorge J. Keegan said that the Soviet Union was attempting to develop acharge-particle beam at the test facility near the city of Semipalatinsk inKazakhstan. The editor of Aviation Week, Robert Holtz said:The Soviet Union has achieved a technical breakthrough in high-energy physicsapplications that may soon provide it with a directed-energy beam weapon capableof neutralizing the entire United States ballistic missile force and checkmatingthis country’s strategic doctrine … The race to perfect directed-energy weaponsis a reality. Despite initial skepticism, the US scientific community is nowpressuring for accelerated efforts in this area.The news got through to the White House, but President Jimmy Carter (1924 – )said: ‘We do not see any likelihood at all, based on our constant monitoring ofthe Soviet Union, that they have any prospective breakthrough in a new weaponssystem that would endanger our country.’Nevertheless, under the Carter administration, work began on a major space-basedlaser programme. Under the direction of the Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency, the ALPHA chemical laser project was begun in 1978. Contracts for theTALON GOLD targeting system were awarded in 1979, and the Large OpticsDemonstration Experiment (LODE) started in 1980. These programmes formed thebasis for the Strategic Defense Initiative – aka ‘Star Wars’ – announced byPresident Ronald Reagan (1911 – 2004) in 1983. SDI added X-ray lasers andneutral particle beams, all of which were reminiscent of Tesla’s ‘Chinese wall’.While this work was going on, fresh applications were made to the FBI to releaseany copies of the Tesla files they had, if only to know what the Soviets may hadlearned about beam weapons in Belgrade.However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union it was discovered that the testsite outside Semipalatinsk was not working on a beam weapon at all, but ratheron nuclear-powered rockets. John Pike, defence analyst at the Federation ofAmerican Scientists, said that the misidentification of the Semipalatinsk testsite ‘must rank as one of the major intelligence failures of the Cold War’."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 16 – Posthumous Recognition I misunderstood Tesla. I think we all misunderstood Tesla. We thought he was adreamer and visionary. He did dream and his dreams came true, he did havevisions but they were of a real future, not an imaginary one.John Stone Stone In 1943 – a few months after Tesla’s death – the US Supreme Court upheld Tesla’sradio patent number 645,576. The Court had a selfish reason for doing so. TheMarconi Company was suing the United States Government for use of its patents inWorld War I. The Court simply avoided the action by restoring the priority ofTesla’s patent over Marconi. Nevertheless, it re-established the situation thathad applied 40 years earlier when Tesla was recognized as the inventor of radiowhose patents had been infringed by Marconi.In 1956, the Nobel laureate Niels Bohr (1885 – 1962), father of quantum physics,spoke at a centennial congress held in Tesla’s honour. In Yugoslavia, acommemorative stamp was issued. Tesla appeared on the 100 dinar note and the‘Tesla’ became the unit of magnetic flux density. The asteroid 2244 Tesla wasnamed by Serbian astronomer Milorad Protic in Belgrade when he discovered it on22 October 1952. The Tesla Crater on the far side of the Moon was named afterhim when five Lunar Orbiters photographed the other side in 1966 and 1967. TheIEEE has presented the Nikola Tesla Award for outstanding contributions to thegeneration or utilization of electric power annually since 1976. Nikola TeslaCorner is located in the heart of Manhattan, at the corner of West 40th Streetand 6th Avenue reminding New Yorkers that the great man used to roam those verystreets. Niagara Falls also celebrates the legendary inventor with twomonuments, one on Goat Island was unveiled in 1976, while in 2006 a statue ofTesla standing on an AC motor was erected in Queen Victoria Park on the Canadianside of the falls. Finally, back in Serbia, Belgrade International Airport wasrenamed Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport in 2006.During the second half of the 20th century Tesla was overlooked by the historybooks. Unlike Marconi and Edison, he did not have large companies named afterhim. Westinghouse could have honoured him, but not unnaturally they give theirplaudits to George Westinghouse himself. Also unlike Westinghouse, Edison andthe Wright Brothers, Tesla was not born in America so he could not be seen as ashining example of ‘Yankee ingenuity’. Those great Americans were also seen aspractical men who made things that ordinary people could understand. Few peoplein the general populace understand what AC is, how an induction motor works orwhat the principles behind the propagation of radio waves are.With Tesla’s seemingly science-fiction ideas towards the end of his life, he wasseen as a mystic and, more than anything, the ultimate mad scientist with hismiddle-European accent and his eccentric personal habits. However, in the 1950s,Tesla’s fame grew in the burgeoning counter-culture. An electrical engineer nameArthur H. Matthews claimed to have made a Teslascope to communicate with theinhabitants of other planets. He said that Tesla was a Venusian born on aspaceship travelling from Venus to Earth in July 1856, revealing all in Wall ofLight: Nikola Tesla and the Venusian Spaceship. In 1959, Margaret Stormpublished the occult biography of Tesla, Return of the Dove. Her story alsoinvolved flying saucers which were very much in vogue.In the 1970s, Ralph Bergstresser, who had known Tesla for the last 6 months ofhis life, produced ‘Tesla Plates’ which are marketed by the Swiss TeslaInstitute. These, in some fashion, are supposed to tap into the energy of theuniverse. As Tesla’s ideas, especially in later life, drew on thinking from boththe East and the West, he became of interest to New Age thinkers. His striking,dark, middle-European looks and his development of willpower also appealed.With the energy crisis of the 1970s, Tesla’s idea of free energy had renewedappeal and a researcher named Robert Golka tried to recreate Tesla’s Coloradoexperiments. In 1984, the first International Tesla Symposium was held inColorado Springs. The group met annually for the next 14 years. It spawned theInternational Tesla Society whose membership grew to 7,000 worldwide, but itwent bust in 1998. Devotees have found new homes in the Tesla Memorial Societyof New York, the Tesla Engine Builders Association and the Tesla Universewebsite. Tesla and his inventions still fascinate fans of science fiction andcomputer games, and he has been celebrated in documentaries on his life and theWar of the Currents on America’s PBS and the BBC.In 2003, Tesla Motors began producing electric vehicles in California, usingengines based on Tesla’s designs. They are now quoted on the NASDAQ stockexchange and have a European Headquarters at Maidenhead in the UK.Tesla Magazine was launched on 10 July 2013. At the same time, the Tesla ScienceFoundation joined forces with Belgrade’s Nikola Tesla Museum to create atravelling exhibition called Tesla’s Wonderful World of Electricity which touredthe United States and Canada. Its aim was to get Tesla the recognition hedeserves in America. With new movies being made about his life, it is possiblethat it is not too late – this goal may still be achieved."},{"pageContent":"Appendixes"},{"pageContent":"Electrifying Science Facts......................................................... Electrical Science in 1875The ancient Greeks discovered that you could produce static electricity byrubbing amber with silk. In the 18th century, scientists such as the AmericanBenjamin Franklin (1706 – 90) and the Briton Henry Cavendish (1731 – 1810) madea systematic study of the phenomenon.In 1791, the Italian Luigi Galvani (1737 – 98) discovered electricity in animaltissue when he saw a frog’s leg twitch when touched by two different metals.This led his friend Alessandro Volta (1745 – 1827) to make the first electricbattery in 1800.Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted (1777 – 1851) discovered the relationshipbetween electricity and magnetism in 1820 when he saw a compass needle beingdeflected when an electric current was turned on and off. French physicistAndré-Marie Ampère (1775 – 1836) developed this into the science ofelectrodynamics.In 1831, British scientist Michael Faraday (1791 – 1867) demonstrated the lawsof electromagnetic induction, producing a current in a coil by moving a magnetback and forth inside it. This led to the development of both the electric motorand the generator where coils of wire were mounted in a rotor, or armature,within a magnetic field.As the magnetic effect is only apparent when the current is turned on and off,an electric motor has a commutator – that is, a split ring with electricalcontact, or brushes, resting on either side. As the motor turns, contactsswitch, reversing the current flow in the coil. Similarly, a generator needs acommutator to prevent the current reversing as the rotor turns. <Back>[chapter-8.xhtml#b4] The Gramme DynamoWith the rapid development of the telegraph system in the 1840s and 1850s, whatwas needed was direct current (DC) that flowed in only one direction. This isthe type normally produced by batteries.Even with a commutator, introduced by Parisian instrument-maker Hippolyte Pixii(1808 – 35) in 1832, the current delivered by a generator, while not reversing,was not smooth and constant like that from a battery. It builds to a peak thendrops back to zero again. However, Belgian electrical engineer Zénobe-ThéophileGramme (1826 – 1901) demonstrated his Gramme dynamo at the French Academy ofSciences in 1871. By increasing the number of coils on the rotor and the numberof sections on the commutator, it could produce a near constant direct current.Shown at the International Exhibition in Vienna, one Gramme dynamo was connectedto another one which acted as a motor. Until then, motors had only been poweredby expensive batteries. Gramme’s business partner, French engineer HippolyteFontaine (1833 – 1910) had demonstrated that power could be transmitted from oneplace to another without the inefficient shafts, belt, chains or ropes used toconnect steam engines to machines – with obvious advantages for industry. <Back>[chapter-9.xhtml#b6] What is Alternating Current?The electricity from a battery, lightning or a Van de Graaf generator thatproduces a static charge is direct current. It flows in only one direction.Alternating current flows in one direction, then the other. It cycles throughpeaks and troughs as it changes direction.With a direct current, when a switch is thrown a magnetic field builds up aroundthe wire, inducing a current in any conductor nearby. This only occurs when thefield is building up or when the field collapses when the current is switchedoff. With an alternating current, the electric current is effectively beingswitched on and off all the time, inducing an alternating current in thesecondary conductor. This property is utilized in an induction motor, where acurrent is induced in secondary coils on the rotor, and in a transformer, wherethe voltage is stepped up and down. <Back> [chapter-9.xhtml#b9] Pearl Street Power StationThe first electric lights were arc-lamps that gave off light from electricsparks. But in 1879, Edison came up with the improved incandescent lamp. Arclamps had been connected in series – if one failed, all of them went out. Edisonconnected his lamps in parallel, so each faulty bulb could be replacedindividually. This had created an astonishing demand for electric power. Edisonbuilt his first DC power station on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan in 1882,initially to power 400 lamps owned by 85 customers. It quickly became a monopolyand by 1884 it was serving 508 customers with 10,164 lamps. The electricity wascarried above ground on poles with dozens of crooked crossbeams supportingsagging wires. The exposed electrical wiring was a constant danger andunsuspecting children climbing the poles would suffer lethal electric shocks. Inspite of the perils, wealthy New Yorkers rushed to have their homes wired, themost important being the banker, J.P. Morgan, who had invested heavily inEdison. <Back> [chapter-11.xhtml#b14] The TransformerThe transformer uses the same principles of electromagnetic induction employedin electric motors and generators. Two coils of wire are wound around a singleiron core. When an electrical current is passed through one of them, itmagnetizes the iron core. This, in turn, induces an electric current in theother one. The voltage is stepped up or stepped down according to the ratio ofthe number of turns of wire in each coils. However, induction only works whenthe electrical current is being switched on and off again, so an alternatingcurrent rather than a direct current must be used.The transformer is a vital component of any power distribution system astransmission losses are much smaller when the voltage is higher – as lesscurrent is needed to convey the same amount of energy. So electricity generatedat a power station is stepped up in voltage using a transformer before itreaches the transmission lines. Then, at its destination, it is stepped down foruse in the home or factory. <Back> [chapter-11.xhtml#b16] Harold Brown - Dying in the Name of ScienceUnder the headline: ‘Died for Science’s Sake – A Dog Killed With The ElectricCurrent’, The New York Times of 31 July 1888 reported on one of Harold P.Brown’s demonstrations. In Professor Chandler’s lecture room at Columbia’sSchool of Mines, Brown told an invited audience that he represented no companyand no financial or commercial interest. He also maintained that he had provedby repeated experiments that a living creature could stand shocks from acontinuous current much better than from an alternating current. He had applied1,410 volts of DC to a dog without fatal results, but had repeatedly killed dogswith 500 to 800 volts of alternating current.Brown then brought out a Newfoundland mix weighing 76 pounds (34 kg). The dogwas muzzled and tied down inside a wire cage. The newspaper reported:Mr Brown announced that he would first try the continuous current at a force of300 volts [DC]. When the shock came the dog yelped and then subsided. A relayhas been attached to the apparatus, which shut off the current almost as soon asit was applied. When the dog got 400 volts he struggled considerably, stillyelping. At 700 volts he broke his muzzle and nearly freed himself. He was tiedagain. At 1,100 volts his body contorted with the pain of the brutal experiment.His resistance to the current then dropped from 1,500 to about 2,500 volts.‘He will be less trouble,’ said Mr Brown, ‘when we try the alternating current.As these gentlemen say, we shall make him feel better.’ It was proposed the dogbe put out of his misery at once. This was done with an alternating current of330 volts killing the beast.When Brown brought out another dog, an agent from the American Society for thePrevention of Cruelty to Animals stepped in. Meanwhile, the assembledelectricians said that the dog had been weakened by the DC current before the ACwas applied. But Brown insisted that the only places AC should be used were ‘thedog pound, the slaughter house and the State prison’. <Back>[chapter-11.xhtml#b17] What is Viscosity?All fluids have viscosity. Thick fluids such as molasses have a high viscosity;thin ones, such as air, a low viscosity. All fluids, to a greater or lesserextent, stick to solid surfaces. The molecules near to the surface adhere to itand travel at the same velocity. Molecules a little further away are slowed by aviscous interaction with those stuck on the surface. Further away still, thefluid flows freely. The transition between the layer stuck to the surface andthe free-flowing stream is called the boundary layer. Tesla found that he coulduse ‘viscous shear’ in the boundary layer to transfer energy from the fluid tothe turbine. <Back> [chapter-19.xhtml#b47] Explaining Standing WavesA standing wave is caused by the combination of two waves moving in oppositedirections and is usually found where a wave is reflected from a surface or theend of a wire. The two waves are superimposed and either add together or canceleach other out. A vibrating rope tied at one end will produce a standing wave.At some positions along the rope there is no movement. These points are callednodes. Either side, where the movement is the greatest, are antinodes. <Back>[chapter-24.xhtml#b66] The Edison MedalThe Edison Medal was created in 1904 by a group of Edison’s friends andassociates as an annual award to be given to a living electrician for‘meritorious achievement in electrical science and art’. In 1909, the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers agreed to present it as their highest award.The first recipient was Tesla’s rival Elihu Thomson. George Westinghouse andAlexander Graham Bell also received the award. The medal is now presented by theInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, formed when the AIEE mergedwith the Institute of Radio Engineers. <Back> [chapter-20.xhtml#b56]"},{"pageContent":"Tesla’s Friends and Contemporaries................................................................................ Thomas Alva Edison (1847 – 1931)Born in Ohio, Edison had little schooling. At the age of 12 he got a job on therailroad where he learned telegraphy. He went on to develop the duplex systemthat sent two messages at once and a printer that converted electrical signalsinto letters.He quit and went into business for himself, developing the quadruplex system,which sent four messages at once for Western Union and their rivals. With thehelp of his father, he established a laboratory and machine shop at Menlo Park,New Jersey, which became the world’s first industrial research facility. Therehe developed underwater cable for the telegraph, set about improving theprimitive telephone developed by Alexander Graham Bell, and inventing thephonograph. This brought him worldwide fame as the Wizard of Menlo Park.He worked on the incandescent light bulb, though battles over patents ensued. Healso developed electric motors and generators to power his lighting systems,first on the steamship Columbia, then on buildings in New York and London.A pioneer in motion pictures, he also developed batteries for submarines and theModel T Ford. In all, he took out a world record 1,093 patents and remains themost famous inventor in American history. <Back> [chapter-9.xhtml#b7] Alexander Graham Bell (1847 – 1922)Edinburgh-born Bell first visited the USA in 1871 where he demonstrated hisfather’s method of teaching speech to the deaf. The following year he opened aschool for teachers of the method in Boston.With young technician Thomas Watson, he set to work on developing ways of usingelectricity to transmit sound, getting his patent for the telephone in 1876.Hundreds of patent suits followed. Nevertheless, the Bell Telephone Company wasestablished the following year, successfully fighting off suits by twosubsidiaries of the Western Union Telegraph Company.Bell also invented the photophone, which transmitted sound on a beam of light,and the Graphophone, that recorded sound on wax cylinders. He experimented withsonar detection, huge flying kites and hydrofoils, while continuing to find waysto aid the deaf. <Back> [chapter-9.xhtml#b8] George Westinghouse (1846 – 1914)George Westinghouse was a descendent of the aristocratic Russian vonWistinghousen family. His father was also an inventor with six patents forfarming machinery to his name. In his father’s machine shop in Schenectady, NewYork, the young Westinghouse experimented with batteries and Leyden jars – glassjars coated with metal foil, used for storing electrical charge. At 15, he madehis first invention, a rotary steam engine. After serving in both the US Armyand Navy during the American Civil War, he attended the nearby Union College,but soon dropped out. In 1865, he patented his rotary engine, and a device forputting derailed freight cars back on the tracks. Soon after, he designed areversible cast-steel frog which prolonged the life of railroad track switches.Having been involved in a near collision on the railway, he put his mind toimproving the braking system which, until then, had depended on a brakeman onevery carriage. His first system, using steam, proved impractical. But then in1869 he came up with air-brakes that soon became standard in the US and Europe.He then worked on signalling, devising an electrical system. With the aid ofTesla, Westinghouse entered the ‘War of the Currents’, championing AC againstEdison’s DC system. By 1889, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation was a globalcompany, employing over 500,000 people. However, in the financial panic of 1907,he lost control of the companies and retired altogether in 1911. <Back>[chapter-11.xhtml#b15] Lord Kelvin (1824 – 1907)Scottish engineer, mathematician and physicist, William Thomson was knighted in1866 and made a peer in 1892 for his services to science and engineering. Hehelped develop the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the mathematical analysis ofelectricity and magnetism, the electromagnetic theory of light, the geophysicaldetermination of the age of the Earth and the basics of hydrodynamics. His workon submarine telegraph cables helped make Britain the hub of globalcommunications. He perfected the mariner’s compass and worked out the correctvalue of absolute zero. The units of the absolute temperature scale are namedKelvins in tribute to him. <Back> [chapter-11.xhtml#b19] James Clerk Maxwell (1831–79)Born in Scotland, James Clerk Maxwell had already demonstrated colourphotography and worked on the standardization of electrical units when, in 1865,he published A Dynamical Theory of Electrical Field. In it, he sought to convertthe physical laws of electromagnetic induction discovered by Faraday intomathematics. His famous equations showed that electric and magnetic fieldstravel through space as waves moving at the speed of light. This led him topropose that light was electromagnetic radiation and predicted the existence ofradio waves. <Back> [chapter-13.xhtml#b24] Hermann von Helmholtz (1821 – 94)Like many scientists of the day, Helmholtz worked in multiple fields, includingphysiology, optics, meteorology, hydrodynamics and the philosophy of science. Heis best known for the Law of Conservation of Energy. Between 1869 and 1871, hestudied electrical oscillation, and he noted the oscillations of electricity ina coil when it was connected to a Leyden jar. He sought to measure the speed ofelectromagnetic induction, but left the determination of the length of electricwaves to his star pupil, Heinrich Hertz. <Back> [chapter-13.xhtml#b22] Heinrich Hertz (1857 – 94)After studying under Helmholtz, Hertz began his investigation of the theories ofJames Clerk Maxwell. He developed primitive equipment to generateelectromagnetic waves and measured their wavelengths and velocity. Demonstratingthat they could be reflected and refracted like light and radiant heat, heshowed that light and heat were also electromagnetic waves. He was just 36 whenhe died. <Back> [chapter-13.xhtml#b23] Michelson-Morley ExperimentDevised by A.A. Michelson and later refined with Edward Morley, theMichelson-Morley experiment sought to detect the velocity of the Earth throughthe all-pervading ether which Helmholtz and Hertz maintained electromagneticwaves were propagated through. A sensitive interferometer was used to comparethe speed of light in two directions at right angles to each other. If theuniverse is filled with ether, the speed of light along the Earth’s direction oftravel should be less than its velocity at right angles to it. No difference wasdetected. Ergo the ether did not exist. <Back> [chapter-13.xhtml#b26] Guglielmo Marconi (1874 – 1937)In 1894, Marconi began experimenting with an induction coil, a Morse key and asparking gap, along with a simple detector, at his father’s estate near Bologna.Devising a simple aerial, he increased the range to 1.5 miles (2.4 km). He movedto London where he filed his first patent in June 1896. Using balloons andkites, he increased the range still further. In 1899, signals were sent acrossthe English Channel and the America’s Cup used Marconi’s equipment forship-to-shore communication. The following year Marconi took out patent No.7777, which enabled several stations to operate on different frequencies. Thiswas overturned by the US Supreme Court in 1943 when it was shown that Tesla andothers had already developed radio-tuning circuits.In December 1901, Marconi transmitted a signal across the Atlantic from Cornwallin England to Newfoundland in Canada. This led to the discovery that thecurvature of the Earth had proved no obstacle because radio waves reflected offionized layers in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. Marconi continued toimprove the range and efficiency of wireless devices and set up companies toexploit his discoveries. In 1909 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics andin 1932 the Marconi company won the contract to establish short-wavecommunication between England and the countries of the British Empire. <Back>[chapter-13.xhtml#b28] Mark Twain (1835 – 1910)Born Samuel Langhorne Clemens, Twain was an American humorist and writer whofound worldwide fame with The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventuresof Huckleberry Finn (1885).

Afterstudying science at the University of Wisconsin, he found work in a factorywhere he adapted and improved machinery. An accident nearly cost him his sight.In its aftermath he undertook a walk of nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 km) fromIndiana to Florida. In 1868, he arrived in the Yosemite Valley in California andbecame an advocate for the preservation of the wilderness there. Due to hislobbying, National Parks were set up at Yosemite, Sequoia and elsewhere. In1903, he accompanied President Theodore Roosevelt on a camping trip in theYosemite region. <Back> [chapter-13.xhtml#b32] Richmond Pearson Hobson (1870 – 1937)Graduating from the US Naval Academy in 1889, Hobson was given temporary commandof the collier Merrimac during the Spanish-American War. Off Cuba, his ship wasdisabled by enemy fire and he scuttled her in the entrance to Santiago Harbour,blockading the Spanish Fleet. He and his crew of six were imprisoned in MorroCastle. When he was released in a prisoner exchange in 1898, he returned to theUS to a hero’s welcome. Women admirers flocked to him and he became ‘the mostkissed man in America’. Awarded the Medal of Honor, he became a congressman. Oneof Tesla’s closest friends, he said the inventor once told him that he had‘never touched a woman’. <Back> [chapter-13.xhtml#b31] The X-Ray Man – Wilhelm Röntgen (1845 – 1923)In 1895, while he was professor of physics at Würzburg, Germany, Röntgen noticedthat when he ran an electric current through a partially evacuated glass tube itgave off a mysterious radiation that affected photographic plates. Unlike lightthis passed through paper, wood and aluminium, so he called them X-rays. Soonafter, he took a picture of the bones in his wife’s hand. News of his discoveryspread quickly round the world and he was awarded the first Nobel Prize inphysics in 1901. <Back> [chapter-14.xhtml#b35] Hammond and SonMining engineer and philanthropist John Hays Hammond (1855 – 1936) gave Tesla$10,000 to develop his Telautomaton. Later his son, John (Jack) Hays Hammond Jr(1888 – 1965), developed Tesla’s ideas and became known as ‘The Father of RemoteControl’. At Yale, Jack developed electrically controlled steering and enginecontrol for a boat, controlling the mechanisms at a distance using a wirelessdevice. In 1909, he got his father to arrange a meeting for him with Teslabecause there was some ‘important information’ he needed from him. With Marconiwireless, which itself used Tesla Coils, attached to two 360-ft (110 m) towers,Jack could control a crew-less boat from a lookout station near his laboratoryat Freshwater Cove. Later, Jack invited Tesla to speak at his graduation fromYale. <Back> [chapter-19.xhtml#b48] Tesla, a boxing fanTesla claimed to have made a study of heavyweight title fights after the 1892match where street-fighter John L. Sullivan (1858 – 1918), who had held theworld title for 10 years, was knocked out by college-educated ‘Gentleman Jim’Corbett (1866 – 1933). In 1927, he made headlines predicting the outcome of therematch between Gene Tunney (1897 – 1978) and the ‘Manassa Mauler’ Jack Dempsey(1895 – 1983) who, though he had lost the title a year earlier, was ahead in thebetting.The New York Herald Tribune said: ‘Sitting in this suite at the HotelPennsylvania, the 71-year-old inventor did not hedge or pussyfoot, but declaredthat Tunney was ‘at least 10 to 1 favourite’. On the basis of mechanics, Teslasaid, ‘Tunney will hit Dempsey continuously and at will’. He added that Tunneyalso had the advantage because he was single. ‘Other things being equal,’ Teslasaid, ‘the single man can always excel the married man.’ In his later years,Tesla would be seen dining with other boxers, including the ‘Midland Mauler’Jimmy Adamick and Yugoslav welterweight Fritzie Zivic. <Back>[chapter-18.xhtml#b42] J.P. Morgan (1837 – 1913)The son of a successful financier, Junius Spencer Morgan (1813-90), JohnPierpont Morgan began his career in 1857 with the New York banking firm ofDuncan, Sherman and Company, which was the US representative of the London firmGeorge Peabody and Company. By 1871 he was a partner at Drexel, Morgan andCompany, soon the predominant source of government financing. In 1895, it becameJ.P. Morgan and Company, and one of the most powerful banking houses in theworld. Because of his links with Peabody, Morgan was able to provide the rapidlygrowing US industrial corporations with capital from British banks.Investing in railroads, by 1902, he controlled some 5,000 miles (8,000 km) oftrack. In 1891, he arranged the merger of Edison General Electric andThomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric. In the depressionthat followed the panic of 1893, he formed a syndicate to resupply the USgovernment’s depleted gold reserve. Having financed the creation of the FederalSteel Company in 1898, he merged it with the giant Carnegie Steel Company in1901 to form US Steel Corporation. The following year, he formed theInternational Harvester Company and the International Merchantile Marine, whichdominated transatlantic shipping. He led the attempt to avert a generalfinancial collapse following the stock market panic of 1907. Then he beganamassing banks and insurance companies. This gave him control over the nation’sleading corporations and financial institutions. <Back> [chapter-18.xhtml#b43] Lee De Forest (1873 – 1961)Like Tesla, De Forest was the son of a church minister who hoped his son wouldfollow him into the ministry. Lee spent much of his youth at Talladega College,traditionally an African-American school where his father was president. In1893, he enrolled at the Sheffield Scientific at Yale where he studiedengineering. Six years later he was awarded a PhD for a thesis entitledReflections of Hertzian Waves from the Ends of Parallel Wires.Experimenting in radio-telegraphy, he managed to interest the US Army and Navyin his apparatus. His equipment was used by European reporters to senddespatches during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 – 05. In 1906, De Forest fileda patent for a vacuum tube diode to detect radio waves. The following year, hepatented the triode or Audion valve. This placed a grid between the electrodeswhich allowed it amplify feeble electric currents. While others developed itsfull potential, it was the mainstay of amplification until the invention of thetransistor. In 1912, De Forest was indicted, and subsequently acquitted, of mailfraud by seeking to promote this ‘worthless device’. His triode madetranscontinental wireless telephony possible.Seeking to promote radio as a new medium, in 1910, De Forest broadcast a liveperformance by Italian opera star Enrico Caruso from the Metropolitan OperaHouse. Two years later De Forest found he could boost a weak signal further byfeeding the output of one tube to the grid of the next, and so on. He also foundthat by feeding the output of an Audion tube back to its own grid, he couldproduce a stable oscillator whose signal could be modulated to carry speech andmusic.In the face of a storm of infringement suits, he sold his patents to others toexploit. He went on to invent a system for recording sound on film, making thetalkies possible. <Back> [chapter-18.xhtml#b44] Reginald Fessenden (1866 – 1932)Born in Quebec, Fessenden studied mathematics, but left university without adegree. In 1886, he moved to the US and went to work for Thomas Edison. Heworked on a series of projects, but in 1890, when Edison suffered a financialset back, he was laid off. After working in various manufacturing companies, hebecame professor of electrical engineering at Purdue University, moving onto theWestern University of Pennsylvania – now Pittsburgh University – the followingyear.From 1900 to 1902, he worked for the Weather Bureau, adapting wirelesstelegraphy for weather forecasting and storm warnings. In 1900 he was granted apatent for a sensitive detector that made wireless telephone possible andinvented the heterodyne receiver which combines two high-frequencies to producean audible tone. With two Pittsburgh financiers, he formed the National ElectricSignaling Company in 1902, which transmitted the first voice signals over adistance. In 1906, he made the first two-way transatlantic transmission. But hefell out with his backers and the company ended up bankrupt.During his career Fessenden filed some 300 patents, many were subject tolitigation. He sued RCA for $60 million, settling out of court in 1928 for alarge cash payment. Among his admirers was Elihu Thomson who called Fessenden‘the greatest wireless inventor of the age – greater than Marconi’. <Back>[chapter-18.xhtml#b45] Fritz Lowenstein (1874 – 1922)Born in Carlsbad in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Karlovy Vary in the CzechRepublic), Lowenstein studied engineering in Europe before emigrating to the USin 1899 where he went to work for Tesla. He helped build and operate themagnifying transmitter in Colorado Springs. ‘Possessed of the highest technicaltraining,’ Tesla said, he became a close confidant, discussing the project withhim every day over lunch and dinner at the Alta Vista Hotel. They parted whenLowenstein returned to Germany to marry, but Tesla re-employed Lowenstein in1902 to work at Wardenclyffe. He also worked with Jack Hammond and AlexanderGraham Bell, and subsequently began a company making radio sets for the US Navyduring World War I, paying royalties to Tesla for the use of his patents. <Back>[chapter-19.xhtml#b49] Benjamin Franklin Miessner (1890 – 1976)Miessner studied electrical engineering at Purdue University and worked for theUS Navy in 1908 before becoming chief assistant in the Tesla-Hammond lab atGloucester. He worked on the development of the electric dog and superheterodynereception. This improved the amplification in a wireless set fifty-fold andallowed them to work without a long aerial, essentially turning the wirelessreceiver from an experimental apparatus into a domestic appliance. He is alsocredited with inventing the ‘cat’s whisker’ detector in early crystal sets,which he sold for $200, and the electric organ. A pioneer in aircraft radio anddirectional microphones in submarines, he sold more than two hundred patents,making over $2 million. <Back> [chapter-19.xhtml#b50] Sir Oliver Lodge (1851 – 1940)Lodge entered his father’s clay business in Staffordshire, England when he was14. Then on a visit to London he heard prominent physicist John Tyndall (1820 –93) lecture at the Royal Institution. This piqued his interest in science and,at the age of 22, he resumed his education. In 1890, the French scientistÉdouard Branly (1844 – 1940) showed that iron filings in a glass tube coalesced– or ‘cohered’ – under the influence of electromagnetic waves. Lodge added a‘trembler’ that shook up the filings between waves and made other improvements,making an effective detector.Following in the footsteps of Hertz, he studied standing waves in conductingwires. After Hertz’s untimely death in 1894, he gave a lecture at the RoyalInstitution called The Work of Hertz. When this was published, it had awidespread influence across Europe. He also filed a number of important patents.When his son Raymond was killed in World War I, he became interested inspiritualism and served as president of the Society for Psychical Research.<Back> [chapter-19.xhtml#b51] Michael Pupin (1858 – 1935)Born in Banat, a buffer zone between the Ottoman and the Austrian Empires, Pupinwas a Serb like Tesla. His parents were illiterate and sent him to Prague. Aftera year, not yet 16, he went alone to America, arriving in New York in 1874. For5 years, he took a series of odd jobs, while studying at night for admission toColumbia College, now Columbia University. He went on to study in Cambridge andBerlin, where he worked under Helmholtz. He returned to New York to teachmathematical physics at the newly formed department of electrical engineering.In 1901, he was made Professor of Electromechanics, a position he held until heretired in 1931.In 1896, he discovered that atoms struck by X-rays emit secondary X-rayradiation and worked on X-ray fluoroscopy. Five years later, the Bell TelephoneCompany bought the patents for his method of extending the range of telephonecommunication by placing loading coils at specific distances along the line. In1924, he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his best-selling autobiography FromImmigrant to Inventor.Pupin sided with Elihu Thomson in the controversy over who invented the ACpolyphase system and Tesla accused Pupin of stealing his work. In the longpassages on the development of AC in From Immigrant to Inventor, Tesla is hardlymentioned. When working with X-rays, Pupin again ignored Tesla’s contribution.It was Pupin who introduced Marconi to Tesla in 1900, but he also helpedfacilitate Marconi’s cooperation with Edison, earning him, once more, the enmityof Tesla.When Pupin was on his deathbed in 1935, he got his secretary to visit Yugoslavdiplomat Stanko Stoilkovic and ask him to plead with Tesla to visit Pupin whowanted to make peace with him before he died. Tesla said that he would have tothink about Pupin’s request overnight. The following day, Tesla turned up at thehospital. In Pupin’s room he approached the bed with his hand extended and said:‘How are you old friend?’Pupin was overcome with emotion. They were left alone to talk. Tesla said theyhad agreed they would meet up again, but Pupin died immediately after Tesla’svisit. Reconciled at last, Tesla attended his funeral. <Back>[chapter-19.xhtml#b53] Karl Ferdinand Braun (1850 – 1918)Born in Germany, Braun received his doctorate from the University of Berlin in1872 and held a number of academic posts before becoming director of thePhysical Institute and Professor of Physics at the University of Strasbourg in1895. In 1897, he developed the first oscilloscope, or Braun tube, to studyalternating currents using a beam of electrons in a cathode ray. From this,television tubes were developed. He went on to study why early wirelesstransmission was limited to 9.5 miles (15 km), concluding that the limitingfactor was the length of the spark. The solution was to introduce a sparklessantenna circuit, which he patented in 1899. He also developed an antenna thatdirected the transmission in one direction. The Nobel Committee recognized thathe had made considerable improvements to Marconi’s apparatus and awarded theNobel Prize to them jointly in 1909.Braun travelled to New York in 1915.

His treatise The Induction Motor was published by Electrical World &Engineer in 1901. It was expanded and published as a book, The Induction Motorand Other Alternating Current Motors in 1921. Behrend met Tesla in 1901 when hewas assigned to design a motor for Wardenclyffe. In Behrend, Tesla found alike-mind.

In 1901, he noticed that Marconi’s signalsarrived in Newfoundland in greater strength than expected and postulated thatthey had been reflected from an ionized layer in the upper reaches of theatmosphere predicted by English electrical-engineer Oliver Heaviside (1850 –1925). This became known as the Kennelly-Heaviside layer. Professor ofElectrical Engineering at Harvard, Kennelly served as president of the AIEE(1898 – 1900) and the Institute of Radio Engineers (1916).

The Electrical Experimenter followed in 1913 andScience and Invention in 1920. These magazines began to carry science-fictionstories, starting with his own RALPH 124C41+ set in the year 2660, which wasserialized in Modern Electronics in 1911.He began the first dedicated science-fiction magazine, Amazing Stories, in 1926.Despite his reputation for dubious business practices, he continued to write andpublish.

It was there he realized that, if the speed oflight was an absolute, Isaac Newton’s laws of motion must be rewritten toaccommodate Maxwell’s equations. The result was his theory of specialrelativity, which he published in 1905. He then realized that this did not dealwith acceleration or gravity. He combined those to make his theory of generalrelativity in 1915. This was confirmed by astronomical observation 4 years laterand he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 1921.In 1933, he emigrated to the United States, settling in Princeton. Einstein’sequation E=mc2 predicts the possibility of making an atomic bomb. Fearing thatNazi Germany may well have been on their way to doing so, Einstein was persuadedto sign a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning him of thepossibility. He spent the rest of his life trying to develop a unified fieldtheory that would combine all the forces of motion into one theoreticalframework. <Back> [chapter-24.xhtml#b65] George Sylvester Viereck (1884 – 1962)One of Tesla’s more unusual friends towards the end of his life was the poet andauthor George Sylvester Viereck. Born in Munich, he was thought to have been theillegitimate grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm I, an idea he encouraged. He emigratedto the US with his family in 1896 and published his first book of poetryGedichte in 1904 while still a student at the College of the City of New York.It received some favourable critical attention and he quickly built areputation. But then came Word War I. He said: ‘In spite of my staunch supportof the American war effort, I was decried as an isolationist and a pro-German. Iwas boycotted by the war party. Five celebrated authors banded themselvestogether under the slogan, Never Again Viereck. My verse was dropped fromanthologies and my name from Who’s Who in America. I was expelled from thePoetry Society of America which owed its existence largely to my efforts andfrom the Author’s League. I was now a poet without a licence.’He then laboured to build a reputation as a novelist and, as a journalist,interviewed Sigmund Freud, George Bernard Shaw, Mussolini, Hindenburg, GrandDuke Alexander of Russia, Einstein, Henry Ford and, of course, Tesla. With theadvent of World War II, he was again thought to be pro-German. This time withgood reason. He was found to have accepted money from the Nazi Party to spreadpropaganda in the US and was jailed. After the war, his memoir of his prisonexperiences Men Into Beast sold well, but he never regained his literaryreputation. Tesla knew all his poems by heart. <Back> [chapter-25.xhtml#b68] Elmer Gertz (1906 – 2000)Another of the dinner guests Tesla met at Viereck’s house on Riverside Drive wasthe attorney Elmer Gertz. He was a friend of the poet Carl Sandburg (1878 –1967) and the biographer and agent of British journalist and voluptuary FrankHarris (1856 – 1931). He also defended the work of American writer Henry Miller(1891 – 1980) in obscenity trials, murderer Nathan Leopold (1904 – 71) in the1924 Leopold and Loeb case and club owner Jack Ruby (1911 – 67) who murderedPresident Kennedy’s assassin Lee Harvey Oswald (1939 – 63). He was impressedthat he had seen Tesla in the same house as novelist Sinclair Lewis (1885 –1951), Einstein and countless others. He said: ‘In a communicative mood, Teslatold his life story unostentatiously, simply, with quiet eloquence. He told ofhis platonic affairs of the heart … explained the inventions that have made theworld his debtor … and told of his plans, of his credo, of his foibles. It was atale of wonder, told with guileless simplicity.’ Edwin Armstrong (1890 – 1954)At the age of 14, Armstrong read of the achievements of Marconi and set aboutbuilding wireless equipment in the attic of his family home in New York. Hestudied under Pupin at Columbia, where he developed the regenerative, orfeedback, circuit using De Forest’s Audion tube. This increased theamplification a thousand-fold. Signals that could barely be distinguishedthrough headphones could now be heard across the room. At its highestamplification, the circuit became an oscillator that generated radio waves andbecame the basis of radio and television broadcasting. However, Armstrong waschallenged by De Forest in a series of patent suits which dragged on for 14years.In the army during World War I, Armstrong improved Fessenden’s heterodynecircuit to make the superheterodyne circuit, which again greatly improved thesensitivity and stability of radio signals that underlies nearly all radio,radar and television reception over the airwaves. He sold the patents toWestinghouse, which made him, briefly, a millionaire, and he married MarionMacInnis, secretary to David Sarnoff, then general manager of RCA.Armstrong went on to invent FM, or frequency modulation. By modulating thefrequency of the signal rather than its amplitude, or strength, as in AM,high-fidelity broadcasting became possible. But the well established AMbroadcasters were resistant. Armstrong had to spend $300,000 on building an FMstation to prove its worth. After World War II, Armstrong began apatent-infringement suit against RCA who had adopted FM for television.Impoverished by litigation, Armstrong jumped to his death from a 13th storeywindow. <Back> [chapter-25.xhtml#b69]"},{"pageContent":"Tesla’s Inventions........................................ Tesla’s Thermo-magnetic MotorWhen iron magnets are heated they lose their magnetic strength. Tesla devised asmall motor with one fixed magnet and a second moving magnet attached to aflywheel and a pivot arm that pushed against a spring. At room temperature, theattraction between the two magnets was enough to compress the spring and pullthe moving magnet into the flame of a Bunsen burner. This would heat up themagnet. It would lose strength. The spring would then push the magnet back,turning the flywheel. With the magnet now out of the flame, it cooled down. Itsmagnetic strength was restored and the cycle began all over again. <Back>[chapter-10.xhtml#b11] Tesla’s Pyromagnetic GeneratorTesla took a large horseshoe magnet. Across its poles ran a number of hollowiron tubes which were magnetized and had coils of wire wrapped around them.Under the centre of the tubes was a firebox. Above there was a boiler. The coalfire in the firebox heated the iron tubes until they reached about 600°C(1,112°F) and glowed a dull red. As the tubes heated up, they would lose theirmagnetism and the collapsing magnetic field would induce an electric current inthe coils. Then a valve was opened and steam, at 100°C (212°F), would circulatethough the tubes, cooling them. As the magnetism in the tubes was restored,electric current would again be induced in the coils. <Back>[chapter-10.xhtml#b12] Inside an Induction MotorAn electrical motor works through the interaction of two sets of magnets – onestationary, the stator, and one able to move freely, the rotor. For practicalmotors, electromagnets are used as they don’t weaken over time. Permanentmagnets do. So both the stator and rotor are essentially coils of wire aroundmetal cores. However, even electromagnets have no reason to set the rotorspinning. But magnetic attraction will draw a north pole on the rotor towards asouth pole on the stator. To keep the motor turning, the polarity of theelectromagnets has to keep on switching. In early DC motors this was done by asplit ring commutator supplying current to the rotor. Tesla’s genius was that herealized that you did not have to send electricity to the electromagnets on therotor at all. If you supplied alternating current to the coils on the stator,the magnetic field created would induce an electric current in the coils of therotor. The magnetic field produced would oppose that on the stator and the motorwould turn.Essentially, a dynamo or generator is a motor worked in reverse. With a motoryou supply electricity and get a mechanical turning force. In a dynamo yousupply the mechanical turning force and get electricity. Add in the transformerand Tesla had created a complete system of generating, transmitting andutilizing power. <Back> [chapter-11.xhtml#b18] The Legendary Tesla CoilTesla had used coils and capacitors when experimenting with rotating magneticfields for his motors. He continually refined the components, particularly thespecial transformer, or coil, at the heart of the circuit, taking out his firstpatent for a device to run a new and more efficient lighting system in 1891. Thebasic circuit connected a power supply to a large capacitor, the coil orinductor and the electrodes of an adjustable spark-gap. As the capacitor chargesup, the voltage lags behind. In an inductor, voltage is felt immediately whilecurrent is held back as it has to work against the magnetic field its ownpassage causes.If the size of the coil and condenser are selected to have exactly oppositetiming – with voltage peaking in the capacitor just as it reaches a minimum inthe coil – current and voltage can be made to chase each other back and forth.This oscillation is initiated by the spark gap. When the voltage in a capacitorbuilds up, it reaches a level when the air in the gap, which acts as aninsulator, breaks down due to ionization and lets current flow.In a Tesla Coil the inductor is the primary coil of a transformer. When thecircuit sparks, all the energy stored over several microseconds is discharged ina powerful impulse, producing a high voltage in the secondary coil. Once theenergy has been discharged, the voltage across the spark gap falls and the airbecomes an insulator again, until the voltage in the capacitor builds up to therequired level again. This whole process can repeat itself many thousands oftimes per second.In a Tesla Coil, secondary winding is designed to react quickly to a suddenenergy spike. These electrical impulses propagate along the winding as waves.The length of the coil is calculated so that, when the wave crests reach the endand are reflected back, they meet and reinforce the waves behind them, so itappears that the voltage peaks are standing still. If the high-voltage end ofthe secondary coil is attached to an aerial, it becomes a powerful radiotransmitter. In the early decades of radio, most practicable radio transmittersused Tesla Coils. Tesla himself used larger or smaller versions of his inventionto investigate fluorescence, X-rays, radio, wireless power and even theelectromagnetic nature of the earth and its atmosphere. <Back>[chapter-13.xhtml#b25] Developing Electric LightingThe inventors of early electric lighting knew two ways to produce illumination –either by creating a spark, or arc, between electrodes or by running a currentthrough a wire or fibre, heating it up until it glowed. Arc lamps are verybright and were used in searchlights, floodlights, lighthouses and movieprojectors. They were not suitable for domestic use. But heated filaments alsohave their drawbacks. Most materials don’t behave well when heated near theirmelting points. They oxidize, unless surrounded by vacuum or inert gas, or breakapart through internal stress. Joseph Swan (1828 – 1914) in 1878 and ThomasEdison the following year independently developed the carbon-filament bulb. Thiswas superseded by the more efficient tungsten-filament bulb in 1908.However, there is another problem with incandescent lamps. In a domestic 60-wattlight bulb, for example, no more than a few per cent of the energy radiated isvisible. Most is lost as heat. But in 1859, Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel (1820 –91) discovered that certain substances fluoresced when a current was passedthrough a Geissler tube – that is, a partially evacuated glass cylinder.Tesla developed this into the phosphorescent lamp – phosphorescent substancesare slower to emit light than fluorescent ones and continue to glow for sometime after the power is switched off. He began by powering conventional filamentor arc lamps with high-frequency currents. This caused the diffuse gases insideto glow and made certain solid materials give off light. The bulbs remained coldbecause most of the electrical energy passed through them turned into light,rather than heat. Consequently, they were much more efficient. But although heused these experiments to illustrate his celebrated lectures, he seldom patentedthem.Having developed apparatus that produced higher frequencies and voltages thanwere available to anyone else, by 1890, he was able to light phosphorescenttubes without connecting wires. The energy was transmitted to them at radiofrequencies. At higher energies, Tesla’s tubes gave off X-rays. <Back>[chapter-13.xhtml#b29] Tuning-In to Early RadioRadio communication uses electromagnetic waves in the range of frequencies lyingbetween around one hertz, or one cycle per second and a few giga-hertz, or athousand million cycles per second. The wavelength of electromagnetic radiationis the distance from one crest to the next. In an ordinary AM broadcast signal,say about 1,000 kHz on the AM dial, wave crests are spaced at about 969 ft (295m) apart. The number of crests going by in one second is called the frequency.In all waves, the frequency multiplied by the wavelength equals the velocity.The velocity of radio waves is the speed of light.The height of a wave is called its amplitude. In radio waves that is given involts. For waves of the same voltage or amplitude, the more of them that arriveper second the higher the energy, so higher frequency gives more power. A singleburst of high-frequency gamma rays is extremely dangerous, while the lowerfrequencies of radio disperse more easily and pack less of a punch.Radio communication requires a transmitter that produces a signal powerfulenough to be detected some distance away, while at the same time incorporatinguseful information in that signal. The receiver must be able to pick up thatsignal and extract the information. Once scientists had understood the nature ofelectromagnetic waves and detected them, the race was on to produce frequenciesand voltages high enough to make wireless transmission. With what he called the‘magnifier coil’ – now known as the Tesla Coil – Tesla had found a way toproduce both.It quickly became clear to Tesla that, once radio transmission had becomepracticable, the airwaves would be full of signals. What was needed was a way todevelop circuits that worked on pre-selected frequencies so that the desiredsignal could be picked out from among a background of static and unrelated radiotraffic. Tesla perfected tuning which lies at the heart of all communicationsystems today. <Back> [chapter-13.xhtml#b27] The Remote Control BoatTesla’s tub-like craft was powered by large batteries on board. Radio signalsactivated switches, which controlled the boat’s propeller, rudder and runninglights. But even registering the arrival of a radio signal pulse taxed therudimentary technology of 1898. Tesla had to invent a new kind of coherer or aradio-activated switch to achieve this. The coherer was a canister with a littlemetal oxide powder in it. The powder orients itself in the presence of anelectromagnetic field, such as radio waves, and becomes conductive. In Tesla’scoherer, the canister flips over after the signal has passed, restoring thepowder to a random, non-conductive state.Each signal advanced a disc one step, making a new set of contacts. So if thecontacts had previously given the combination ‘right rudder/propeller forwardfull/light off’, the next step might combine ‘rudder center/propellerstop/lights on’. The connected circuits operated levers, gears, springs andmotors, then flipped the coherer over so it was ready to receive the nextinstruction. Tesla assumed that this system could be used on radio-guidedtorpedoes. But it was too far ahead of its time. The US Navy did finance sometrials in 1916, but the money went to one of Tesla’s competitors as his patenthad expired. Nevertheless, as the 20th century progressed, more and more useswere found for remote control. <Back> [chapter-15.xhtml#b38] Ozone TherapyIt had long been thought that ozone had healing properties and Tesla patented anozone-generating machine in 1896, forming the Tesla Ozone Company in 1900. Hisportable ‘ozonizers’ were used to disinfect rooms as ozone kills germs. He isalso thought to have ozonated olive oil. He gave one of his machines to hislong-serving secretary George Scherff for his wife who was ill at the time. ‘Ibelieve that it will do you and Mrs Scherff a lot of good,’ he wrote, ‘unlessyou have no electricity supply circuit in your house, in which case, it will benecessary to move into other quarters.’ <Back> [chapter-15.xhtml#b37]"},{"pageContent":"Further Reading Astor, John Jacob, A Journey in Other Worlds (New York: D.
