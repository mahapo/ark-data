By considering the interaction of one electron with the rest of the universe it is argued that the electromagnetic energy inherent in curved space-time (“universal electromagnetic energy-momentum”) can be extracted by the electron and used to produce current in a circuit. An example of this principle at work is the recently patented motionless electromagnetic generator. 1. INTRODUCTION In general relativity, [ 11, the symmetric canonical energy momentum tensor T 7 is expressed in terms of Riemann geometry through Einstein’s field equation: G R P k- /L-” ;3 v- /“” - /“” - ’ 0 :- /“” - where c7 /“” is the Einstein field tensor, k is the gravitational constant, is the Ricci tensor, R is the scalar curvature and & %+ is the metric tensor. Eqn. (1) is a field equation in ten unknowns, the elements of P”’ and the equation shows that in the presence of matter, represented by the tensor T Y ’ space-time becomes curved. The gravitational field is the Einstein tensor G J , P and equation (1) shows that the field is the canonical energy- momentum of matter within a factor k. Therefore in the absence of matter (“the vacuum”) the gravitational field vanishes and space-time is Euclidean - the Christoffel symbols vanish and 3."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"with them the Riemann and Ricci tensor elements and the scalar curvature R. The gravitational field must originate in something, and its origin is T P * Equation (1) is an energy-momentum balance equation between field and matter. It follows that space-time in the universe is always Riemannian, and never Euclidean, because in an Euclidean space-time the universe would be devoid of all matter. Equation (1) could equally well be interpreted as indicating that matter fields are the result of curved space-time. In this view there are no point particles, and the symbol m for the mass of the electron is interpreted as a fundamental magnitude in physics. The electron is therefore represented by a matter field in which there are no singularities. The gravitational field mediates the gravitational interaction between matter fields, and there is always a coupling between matter field and gravitational field [2]. The gravitational field originates in one matter field and influences another matter field. The gravitational attraction between two electrons is explained in this way. The interaction between one electron and the rest of the universe is considered similarly, the electron is subjected to the net gravitational field generated by the rest of the universe, a field that is represented by curved space-time through the Einstein tensor G P” generated by the rest of the universe. We refer to this as “ universal gravitational energy-momentum”. The energy inherent in the gravitational field G can be /*” expressed as: even in regions of the universe that appear to be devoid of observable matter. These regions must be distinguished carefully from the vacuum, which in general relativity is flat space- time. In general relativity, the electron can never be entirely free of the gravitational influence of the rest of the universe and can never be free of the influence of universal gravitational energy-momentum.."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"By using Clifford algebra in general relativity, in particular the space-time basis defined by the Pauli matrices [l], Sachs [2] has developed a unified field theory of gravitation and electromagnetism using the principles of general relativity. We refer to this classical unified theory of fields as antisymmetrised general relativity (agr). In agr the electromagnetic field is also space-time curvature, and the electromagnetic interaction between two electrons is mediated by space-time curvature in Riemann geometry. The electromagnetic interaction between one electron and the rest of the universe becomes conceptually the same as the gravitational interaction between one electron and the rest of the universe. It follows that the electron is never free of the electromagnetic influence of the rest of the universe, the “universal electromagnetic energy-momentum”. The latter produces electromagnetic energy momentum in the electron, producing charge-current density. The latter can be used to generate an observable current in a circuit. The source of this current is the canonical electromagnetic energy-momentum in the rest of the universe, and this source influences the electron through the electromagnetic field in agr. This process can be seen to work in devices such as the recently patented motionless electromagnetic generator [3]. The latter conserves energy-momentum and charge-current density in the universe, defined as the electron and the rest. On the simplest conceptual level, the motionless electromagnetic generator can be explained as a device that transforms the universal electromagnetic energy-momentum into a measurable current in a circuit. 2 EXTRACTION OF UNIVERSAL ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY-MOMENTUM BY ONE ELECTRON. Consider one electron interacting with the universal gravitational and electromagnetic energy-momenta in antisymmetrized general relativity [2,4-81. These energy-momenta are represented by the four vector T in the Clifford algebra defined by P"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Sachs [2]. From T f form the symmetric and anti-symmetric tensors: where q % is the metric four vector of agr [2 4-81 and where v ‘d is its quaternion conjugate, obtained from 9/ Y by reversing the sign of the space indices.

In agr the gravitation field due to +I-- p is the symmetric (Einstein) tensor: and the electromagnetic field due to T P is the anti-symmetric tensor: where Q is the Sachs constant with the units of magnetic flux (weber) [4-81. The units of Q are therefore expressible as multiples of 6 / e (the elementary fluxon. where 4-c is the Dirac constant and e the charge on the proton (the negative of the charge on the electron)). The charge-current density produced in one electron by the universal electromagnetic energy-momentum is:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"where D P denotes the covariant derivative of Riemann geometry [2].

Ews- ( --I ) and ( b > are not Maxwell Heaviside field equations, they are equations of agr in which space-time is always curved and in which the electromagnetic field, through eqn. ( 6 ) * is a manifestation of curved space-time. Under well-defined conditions [4-81 equations ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) reduce to those of O(3) electrodynamics [2,4-81, which is a Yang-Mills gauge field theory of electrodynamics with internal gauge group symmetry O(3). It follows that O(3) electrodynamics is also a theory of general relativity. Maxwell Heaviside field theory is a Yang Mills gauge field theory with internal gauge group symmetry U( 1) [l] and Maxwell Heaviside theory is a theory of special relativity ( Euclidean space-time). The O(3) group has a higher symmetry content (e.g. more (three) group structure constants) than the U( 1) group (one), and so O(3) electrodynamics and agr, from which it can be derived are referred generically as theories of “higher symmetry electrodynamics”. It follows that there is no universal electromagnetic energy-momentum in 7."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Maxwell Heaviside field theory, because space-time is flat. The charge current density of the electron on the left hand side of equation ( 7 ) is obtained from the universal electromagnetic energy-momentum on the right hand side. Eqn. (7 ) describes a transfer of electromagnetic energy-momentum to the electron from the rest of the universe, a transfer which takes place in curved space-time. In this process the total energy-momentum and charge-current density in the universe is conserved and Noether’s Theorem [ 11 therefore applies. The universal gravitational and electromagnetic energy- (5) (4) momenta are transferred to the electron by the field tensors G YY and h PY respectively, defined in agr by [2]: G b) 1_ P = Lt- where K P k the spin curvature tensor defined by the four curl of spin affne connections [2] which can be constructed from the Christoffel symbols of Riemann geometry.

The transfer of curvature to current in a circuit continues indefinitely without violation of the laws of conservation of energy-momentum and charge-current density. This is observed experimentally in the MEG (3}, in which a current continues to be measurable when there is no apparent electromotive force, i.e. when the battery used to start it up is switched off a current continues to be observable."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"REFERENCES [l] L.
