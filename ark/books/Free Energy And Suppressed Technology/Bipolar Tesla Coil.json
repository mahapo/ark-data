[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The above pictures are of a double coned coil I acquired. I was informed by the person who owns the mold for this coil that it was designed by Nikola Tesla, himself and that the mold was given to his father. Each cone is 6\" in diameter and 6\" in height. Each cone has approx. 127ft of wire. The end to end inductance of the secondary is 2.36mH. The quarter wave length frequency would calculate to 1.937MHz for a straight solenoid but this coil seem to resonate at about 1.12MHz. The two cones are connected in the middle such that the entire length is one wire. There is no tapping point between the two coils. I had to replace the copper primary due to age and wear but I am keeping the old copper tubing as verification for the coil's age. This coil was likely built in the early 1900s and is identical in layout to Tesla's patent schematics from the late 1890s. Rumor has it that this coil exhibits antigravity properties. But I have not seen antigravity effects, yet. "}]
