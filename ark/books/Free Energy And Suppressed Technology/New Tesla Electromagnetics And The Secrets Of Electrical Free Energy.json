E. Bearden 1982 There are at least twenty-two major discrepancies presently existing in conventional electromagnetics theory. This paper presents a summary of those flaws, and is a further commentary on my discussion of scalar longitudinal Tesla waves in a previous paper, \"Solutions to Tesla's Secrets and the Soviet Tesla Weapons,\" Tesla Book Company, 1981 and 1982. I particularly wish to express my deep appreciation to two of my friends and colleagues who at this time, I believe, wish to remain anonymous. One of the two is an experimental genius who can produce items on the bench that do not work by orthodox theory. The second is a master of materials science and electromagnetics theory. I thank them both for their exceptional contributions and stimuli regarding potential shortcomings in present electromagnetics theory, and their forbearance with the many discussions we have held on this and related subjects. It goes without saying that any errors in this paper are strictly my own, and not the fault of either of my distinguished colleagues. (1) In present electromagnetics theory, charge and charged mass are falsely made identical. Actually, on a charged particle, the \"charge\" is the flux of virtual particles on the \"bare particle\" of observable mass. The charged particle is thus a \"system\" of true massless charge coupled to a bare chargeless mass. The observable \"mass\" is static, three-dimensional, and totally spatial. \"Charge\" is dynamic, four- dimensional or more, virtual and spatiotemporal. Further, the charge and observable mass can be decoupled, contrary to present theory. Decoupled charge -- that is, the absence of mass -- is simply what we presently refer to as \"vacuum.\" Vacuum, spacetime, and massless charge are all identical. Rigorously, we should utilize any of these three as an \"ether,\" as suggested for vacuum by Einstein himself (see http://www.cheniere.org/books/newteslaem/22discrepancies.htm (1 of 11)24.11.2003 21:35:38"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website Max Born, Einstein's Theory of Relativity, Revised Edition, Dover Publications, New York, 1965, p. 224). And all three of them are identically anenergy -- not energy, but more fundamental components of energy. (2) Electrostatic potential is regarded as a purely 3-dimensional spatial stress. Instead, it is the intensity of a many-dimensional (at least four- dimensional) virtual flux and a stress on all four dimensions of spacetime. This is easily seen, once one recognizes that spacetime is identically massless charge. (It is not \"filled\" with charge; rather, it is charge!) Just as, in a gas under pressure, the accumulation of additional gas further stresses the gas, the accumulation of charge (spacetime) stresses charge (spacetime). Further, if freed from its attachment to mass , charge can flow exclusively in time, exclusively in space, or in any combination of the two. Tesla waves -- which are scalar waves in pure massless charge flux itself -- thus can exhibit extraordinary characteristics that ordinary vector waves do not possess. And Tesla waves have extra dimensional degrees of freedom in which to move, as compared to vector waves. Indeed, one way to visualize a Tesla scalar wave is to regard it as a pure oscillation of time itself. (3) Voltage and potential are often confused in the electrostatic case, or at least thought of as \"composed of the same thing.\" For that reason, voltage is regarded as \"potential drop\". This also is not true. Rigorously, the potential is the intensity of the virtual particle flux at a single point -- whether or not there is any mass at the point -- and both the pressure and the point itself are spatiotemporal (4-dimensional), not spatial (3-dimensional) as presently assumed. Voltage represents the spatial intersection of the difference in the potential between two separated spatial points, and always implies at least a miniscule flow of mass current (that is what makes it spatial!). \"Voltage\" is spatial and depends upon the presence of observable mass flow, while scalar electrostatic potential is spatiotemporal and depends upon the absence of observable mass flow. The two are not even of the same dimensionality. (4) The charge of vacuum spacetime is assumed to be zero, when in fact it is a very high value. Vacuum has no mass, but it has great massless charge and virtual particle charge flux. For proof that a charged vacuum is the seat of something in motion, see G.M. Graham and D.G. Lahoz, \"Observation of static electromagnetic angular momentum in vacuo,\" Nature, Vol. 285, 15 .May 1980, pp. 154-155. In fact, vacuum IS charge, identically, and it is also \"spacetime\" and at least four-dimensional. http://www.cheniere.org/books/newteslaem/22discrepancies.htm (2 of 11)24.11.2003 21:35:38"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website (5) Contrary to its present usage, zero is dimensional and relative in its context. A three-dimensional spatial hole, for example, exists in time. If we model time as a dimension, then the spatial hole has one dimension in 4-space. So a spatial absence is a spatiotemporal presence. In the vacuum 4-space, a spatial nothing is still a something. The \"virtual\" concept and the mathematical concept of a derivative are simply two present ways of unconsciously addressing this fundamental problem of the dimensional relativity of zero. (6) The concepts of \"space\" and \"time\" imply that spacetime (vacuum) has been separated into two parts. We can only think of a space as \"continuing to exist in time \" To separate vacuum spacetime into two pieces, an operation is continually required. The operator that accomplishes this splitting operation is the photon interaction, the interaction of vector electromagnetic energy or waves with mass. I have already strongly pointed out this effect and presented a \"raindrop model\" of first-order physical change itself in my book, The Excalibur Briefing, Strawberry Hill Press, San Francisco, 1980, pp. 128-130. (7) \"Vector magnetic potential\" is assumed to be always an aspect of (and connected to) the magnetic field. In fact it is a separate, fundamental field of nature and it can be entirely disconnected from the magnetic field. See Richard P. Feynman et al, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., New York, 1964, Vol. II, pp. 15-8 to 15-14. Curiously, this fact has been proven for years' yet it has been almost completely ignored in the West. The \"Vx\" operator, when applied to the A-field, makes B-field. If the Vx operator is not applied, the \"freed\" A-field possesses much-expanded characteristics from those presently allowed in the \"bound\" theory. Specifically, it becomes a scalar or \"shadow vector\" field; it is not a normal vector field. (note: for V read inverted capital Delta) (8) The speed of light in vacuum is assumed to be a fundamental constant of nature. Instead it is a function of the intensity of the massless charge flux (that is, of the magnitude of the electrostatic potential) of the vacuum in which it moves. (Indeed, since vacuum and massless charge are one and the same, one may say that the speed of light is a function of the intensity of the spatiotemporal vacuum!). The higher the flux intensity (charge) of the vacuum, the faster the speed of light in it. This is an observed fact and already shown by hardcore measurements. For example, distinct differences actually exist in the speed of light in vacuo, when measured on the surface of the earth as compared to measurements in space away from planetary masses. In a vacuum on the surface of the earth, light moves significantly faster. For a discussion and the statistics, see B. N. Belyaev, \"On Random Fluctuations of the Velocity of Light in Vacuum,\" Soviet Physics http://www.cheniere.org/books/newteslaem/22discrepancies.htm (3 of 11)24.11.2003 21:35:38"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website Journal, No. 11, Nov. 1980, pp. 37-42 (original in Russian; translation by Plenum Publishing Corporation.) The Russians have used this knowledge for over two decades in their strategic psychotronics (energetics) program; yet hardly a single U.S. scientist is aware of the measured variation of c in vacuo. In fact, most Western scientists simply cannot believe it when it is pointed out to them! (9) Energy is considered fundamental and equivalent to work. In fact, energy arises from vector processes, and it can be disassembled into more fundamental (anenergy) scalar components, since the vectors can. These scalar components individually can be moved to a distant location without expending work, since one is not moving force vectors. There the scalar components can be joined and reassembled into vectors to provide \"free energy\" appearing at a distance, with no loss in between the initial and distant points. For proof that a vector field can be replaced by (and considered to be composed of) two scalar fields, see E. T. Whittaker, Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, Volume 1, 1903, p. 367. By extension, any vector wave can be replaced by two coupled scalar waves. (10) The classical Poynting vector predicts no longitudinal wave of energy from a time-varying, electrically charged source, In fact, an exact solution of the problem does allow this longitudinal wave. See T. D. Keech and J. F. Corum, \"A New Derivation for the Field of a Time- Varying Charge in Einstein's Theory,\" International Journal of Theoretical Physics, Vol. 20, No, 1, 1981, pp. 63-68 for the proof. (11) The present concepts of vector and scalar are severely limited, and do not permit the explicit consideration of the internal, finer- grained structures of a vector or a scalar. That is, a fundamental problem exists with the basic assumptions in the vector mathematics itself. The \"space'' of a vector field, for example, does not have inter- nested sublevels (subspaces) containing finer \"shadow vectors\" or \"virtual vectors,\" Yet particle physics has already discovered that electrical reality is built that way. Thus one should actually use a \"hypernumber\" theory after the manner of Charles Musés. A scalar is filled with (and composed of) nested levels of other \"spaces'' containing vectors, where these sum to \"zero\" in the ordinary observable frame without an observable vector resultant. In Musés' mathematics, for example, zero has real roots. Real physical devices can be -- and have been -constructed in accordance with Muses' theory. For an introduction to Musés' profound hypernumbers approach, see Charles Musés' foreword to Jerome Rothstein, Communication Organization and Science, The Falcon's Wing Press, Indian Hills, Colorado, 1958. See also Charles Musés, \"Applied Hypernumbers: Computational Concepts,\" Applied Mathematics and http://www.cheniere.org/books/newteslaem/22discrepancies.htm (4 of 11)24.11.2003 21:35:38"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website Computation, Vol. 3, 1976. See also Charles Musés, \"Hypernumbers II,\" Applied Mathematics and Computation, January 1978. (12) With the expanded Tesla electromagnetics, a new conservation of energy law is required. Let us recapitulate for a moment. The oldest law called for the conservation of mass. The present law calls for the conservation of \"mass and energy\", but not each separately. If mass is regarded as simply another aspect of energy, then the present law calls for the conservation of energy. However, this assumes that energy is a basic, fundamental concept. Since the energy concept is tied to work and the movement of vector forces, it implicitly assumes \"vector movement\" to be a \"most fundamental\" and irreducible concept. But as we pointed out, Whittaker showed that vectors can always be further broken down into more fundamental coupled scalar components. Further, Tesla discovered that these \"coupled components\" of \"energy\" can be individually separated, transmitted, processed, rejoined, etc. This directly implies that energy per se need not be conserved. The new law therefore calls for the conservation of anenergy, the components of energy. These components may be coupled into energy, and the energy may be further compacted into mass. It is the sum total of the (anenergy) components -- coupled and uncoupled -- that is conserved, not the matter or the energy per se. Further, this conservation of anenergy is not spatial; rather, it is spatiotemporal in a spacetime of at least four or more dimensions. (13) Relativity is presently regarded as a theory or statement about fundamental physical reality. In fact, it is only a statement about FIRST ORDER reality -- the reality that emerges from the vector interaction of electromagnetic energy with matter. When we break down the vectors into scalars (shadow vectors or hypervectors), we immediately enter a vastly different, far more fundamental reality. In this reality superluminal velocity, multiple universes, travel back and forth in time, higher dimensions, variation of all \"fundamental constants\" of nature, materialization and dematerialization, and violation of the \"conservation of energy\" are all involved. Even our present Aristotlean logic -- fitted to the photon interaction by vector light as the fundamental observation mechanism -- is incapable of describing or modeling this more fundamental reality. Using scalar waves and scalar interactions as much subtler, far less limited observation/detection mechanisms, we must have a new \"superrelativity\" to describe the expanded electromagnetic reality uncovered by Nikola Tesla. (14) \"Charge\" is assumed to be quantized, in addition to always occurring with -- and locked to -- mass. Indeed, charge is not necessarily quantized just as it is not necessarily locked to mass. http://www.cheniere.org/books/newteslaem/22discrepancies.htm (5 of 11)24.11.2003 21:35:38"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website Ehrenhaft discovered and reported fractional charges for years, in the 30's and 40's, and was ignored. See P.A.11. Dirac, \"Development of the Physicist's Conception of Nature,\" Symposium on the Development of the Physicist's Conception of Nature, ed. Jagdish Merha, D. Reidel, Boston, 1973, pp. 12-14 for a presentation of some of Ehrenhaft's results. Within the last few years Stanford University· researchers also have positively demonstrated the existence of \"fractional charge.\" For a layman's description of their work, see \"A Spector Haunting Physics,\" Science News, Vol. 119, January 31, 1981, pp. 68-69. Indeed, Dirac in his referenced article points out that Millikan himself -- in his original oildrop experiments -- reported one measurement of fractional charge, but discounted it as probably due to error. (15) Presently, things are always regarded as traveling through normal space. Thus we use or model only the most elementary type of motion -- that performed by vector electromagnetic energy. We do not allow for things to \"travel inside the vector flow itself.\" Yet, actually, there is a second, more subtle flow inside the first, and a third, even more subtle flow inside the second, and so on. We may operate inside, onto, into, and out of energy itself -- and any anenergy component of energy. There are hypervectors and hyperscalars unlimited, within the ordinary vectors and scalars we already know. Further, these \"internal flows\" can be engineered and utilized, allowing physical reality itself to be directly engineered, almost without limits. (16) We always assume everything exists in time. Actually, nothing presently measured exists in time, because the physical detection/ measurement process of our present instruments destroys time, ripping it off and tossing it away -- and thereby \"collapsing the wave function.\" Present scientific methodology thus is seriously flawed. It does not yield fundamental (spacetime) truth, but only a partial (spatial) truth. This in turn leads to great scientific oversights. For example, mass does not exist in time, but mass x time (masstime) does. A fundamental constant does not exist in time, but the \"constant x time\" does. Energy does not exist in time, but energy x time (action) does. Even space itself does not exist in time -- spacetime does. We are almost always one dimension short in every observable we model. Yet we persist in thinking spatially, and we have developed 1nstruments that detect and measure spatially only. Such instruments can never measure and detect the phenomenology of the nested substrata of time. By using scalar technology, however, less limited instruments can indeed be constructed -and they have been. With such new instruments, the phenomenology of the new electromagnetics can be explored and an engineering technology developed. http://www.cheniere.org/books/newteslaem/22discrepancies.htm (6 of 11)24.11.2003 21:35:38"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website (17) We do not recognize the connection between nested levels of virtual state (particle physics) and orthogonally rotated frames (hyperspaces). Actually the two are identical, as I showed in the appendix to my book, The Excalibur Briefing, Strawberry Hill Press, San Francisco, 1980, pp. 233-235. A virtual particle in the laboratory frame is an observable particle in a hyperspatial frame rotated more than one orthogonal turn away. This of course implies that the hyperspatial velocity of all virtual particles is greater than the speed of light. The particle physicist is already deeply involved in hyperspaces and hyperspatial charge fluxes without realizing it. In other words, he is using tachyons (particles that move faster than light) without realizing it. (18) Presently quantum mechanics rigorously states that time is not an observable, and therefore it cannot be measured or detected. According to this assumption, one must always infer time from spatial measurements, because all detections and measurements are spatial. With this assumption, our scientists prejudice themselves against even looking for finer, subquantal measurement methodologies and instrumentation. Actually this present limitation is a result of the type of electromagnetics we presently know, where all instruments (the \"measurers\") have been interacted with by vector electromagnetic energy (light). Every mass that has temperature (and all masses do!) is continually absorbing and emitting photons, and in the process they are continually connecting to time and disconnecting from time. If time is continually being carried away from the detector itself by its emitted photons, then the detector cannot hold and \"detect\" that which it has just lost. With Tesla electromagnetics, however, the fundamental limitation of our present instruments need not apply. With finer instruments, we can show there are an infinite number of levels to \"time\", and it is only the \"quantum level time\" which is continually being lost by vector light (photon) interaction. By using subquantal scalar waves, instruments can move to deeper levels of time -- in which case the upper levels of time ARE measureable and detectable, in contradistinction to the present assumptions. (19) In the present physics, time is modeled as, and considered to be, a continuous dimension such as length. This is only a gross approximation. Indeed, time is not like continuous \"dimension,\" but more like a series of \"stitches,\" each of which is individually made and then ripped out before the next stitch appears. \"Vector light\" photons interact one at a time, and it is this interaction with mass that creates quantum change itself. The absorption of a photon -- which is energy x time -- by a spatial mass converts it to masstime: the time was added by the photon. The emission of a photon tears away the time, leaving behind again a spatial mass. It is not accidental, then, that time flows at http://www.cheniere.org/books/newteslaem/22discrepancies.htm (7 of 11)24.11.2003 21:35:38"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website the speed of light, for it is light which contains and carries time. It is also not accidental that the photon IS the individual quantum. Since all our instruments presently are continually absorbing and emitting photons, they are all \"quantized,\" and they accordingly \"quantize\" their detections. This is true because all detection is totally internal to the detector, and the instruments detect only their own internal changes. Since these detections are on a totally granular quantized background, the detections themselves are quantized. The Minkowski model is fundamentally erroneous in its modeling of time, and for that reason relativity and quantum mechanics continue to resist all attempts to successfully combine them, quantum field theory notwithstanding. (20) Presently, gravitational field and electrical field are considered mutually exclusive. Actually this is also untrue. In 1974, for example, Santilly proved that electrical field and gravitational field indeed are not mutually exclusive In that case, one is left with two possibilities: (a) they are totally the same thing, or (b) they are partially the same thing. For the proof, see R. M. Santilli, \"Partons and Gravitation: Some Puzzling Questions,\" Annals of Physics, Vol. 83, No. 1, March 1974. With the new Tesla electromagnetics, pure scalar waves in time itself can be produced electrically, and electrostatics (when the charge has been separated from the mass) becomes a \"magic\" tool capable of directly affecting and altering anything that exists in time--including gravitational field. Antigravity and the inertial drive are immediate and direct consequences of the new electromagnetics. (21) Presently, mind is considered metaphysical, not a part of physics, an not affected by physical means. Literally, the prevailing belief of Western scientists is that man is a mechanical robot -- even though relativity depends entirely upon the idea of the \"observer.\" Western science today thus has essentially become dogmatic, and in this respect borders on a religion. Since this \"religion,\" so to speak, is now fairly well entrenched in its power in the state, Western science is turning itself into an oligarchy. But mind occupies time, and when we measure and affect time we can directly measure and affect mind itself. In the new electromagnetics, then, man regains his dignity and his humanity by restoring the reality of mind and thought to science. In my book, The Excalibur Briefing, I have already pointed out the reality of mind and a simplified way in which it can be modeled to the first order. With scalar wave instruments, the reality of mind and thought can be measured in the laboratory, and parapsychology becomes a working, engineering, scientific discipline. (22) Multiple-valued basic dimensional functions are either not permitted or severely discouraged in the present theory For one thing, integrals of multiple valued derivative functions have the annoying http://www.cheniere.org/books/newteslaem/22discrepancies.htm (8 of 11)24.11.2003 21:35:38"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website habit of \"blowing up\" and yielding erroneous answers, or none at all. And we certainly do not allow multiple types of time! This leads to the absurdity of the present interpretation of relativity which permits only a single observer (and a single observation) at a time. So if one believes as \"absurd\" a thing as the fact that more than one person can observe an apple at the same time, the present physics fails. However, the acceptance of such a simple proposition as multiple simultaneous observation leads to a physics so bizarre and incredible that most Western physicists have been unable to tolerate it, much less examine its consequences. In the physics that emerges from multiple simultaneous observation, all possibilities are real and physical. There are an infinite number of worlds, orthogonal to one another, and each world is continually splitting into additional such \"worlds\" at a stupendous rate. Nonetheless, this physics was worked out by Everett for his doctoral thesis in 1956, and the thesis was published in 1957. (See Hugh Everett, III, The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: A Fundamental Exposition, with papers by J. A. Wheeler, B.S. DeWitt, L. N. Cooper and D. Van Vechten, and N. Graham; eds. Bryce S. Dewitt and Neill Graham, Princeton Series in Physics, Princeton University Press, 1973.) Even though it is bizarre, Everett's physics is entirely consistent with all the present experimental basis of physics. The present electromagnetic theory is constructed for only a single \"world\" or universe -- or \"level.\" The expanded theory, on the other hand, contains multiply nested levels of virtual state charge -- and these levels are identically the same as orthogonal universes, or \"hyperframes.\" Multiple kinds -- and values -- of time also exist. The new concept differs from Everett's, however, in that the orthogonal universes intercommunicate in the virtual state. That is, an observable in one universe is always a virtual quantity in each of the other universes. Thus one can have multi-level \"continuities\" and \"discontinuities\" simultaneously, without logical conflict. It is precisely these levels of charge -- these levels of scalar vacuum -- that lace together the discontinuous quanta generated by the interaction of vector light with mass. However, to understand the new electromagnetic reality, one requires a new, expanded logic which contains the old Aristotlean logic as a subset. I have already pointed out the new logic in my paper, \"A Conditional Criterion for Identity, Leading to a Fourth Law of Logic,\" 1979, available from the National Technical Information Center, AD- A071032. Even as logic is extended, quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, and relativity are drastically changed by the Tesla electromagnetics, as I pointed out in my paper, \"Solutions to Tesla's Secrets and the Soviet Tesla Weapons,\" Tesla Book Company, 1580 http://www.cheniere.org/books/newteslaem/22discrepancies.htm (9 of 11)24.11.2003 21:35:38"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Tom Bearden Website Magnolia, Millbrae, California, 94030, 1980. The present electromagnetics is just a special case of a much more fundamental electromagnetics discovered by Nikola Tesla, just as Newtonian physics is a special case of relativistic physics. But in the electromagnetics case, the differences between the old and the new are far more drastic and profound. ADDITIONAL REFERENCES 1, Boren, Dr. Lawrence Milton, \"Discovery of the Fundamental Magnetic Charge (Arising from the new Conservation of Magnetic Energy),\" 1981/82 (private communication). Dr. Boren has a cogent argument that the positron is the fundamental unit of magnetic charge. His theory thus assigns fundamentally different natures to positive charge and negative charge. In support of Dr. Boren, one should point out that the \"positive\" end of circuits can simply be \"less negative\" than the \"negative\" end. In other words, the circuit works simply from higher accumulation of negative charges (the \"negative\" end) to a lesser accumulation of negative charges (the \"positive\" end). Nowhere need there be positive charges (protons, positrons, etc.) to make the circuit work. Dr. Boren's theory, though dramatic at first encounter, nonetheless bears close and meticulous examination -- particularly since he has been able to gather experimental data which support his theory and disagree with present theory. 2.

Member A.I.A.A. This paper was presented at The First International Symposium on Non-Conventional Energy Technology, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Oct. 23-24, 1981. (Reprinted by permission of the author.) \"Far more harm is done to the progress of science by skepticism than by gullibility\". (Dr. Robert Wood, Director R & D, McDonnel-Douglas Astronautics Div., Cal.) NASA - Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA is named after Samuel Pierpont Langley (1834-1906), an American astronomer, engineer and architect. Langley worked out the aerodynamic principles for manned flight. In principal, his calculations were correct; but the structural materials he used for wings and engines were ,insufficient. In December of 1903, the New York Times published an editorial complaining about his foolish dream and the associated waste of government money. The editorial predicted that: \"man would not fly for a thousand years\". Only 9 days after the editorial was published, the Wright brothers made their first successful powered flight at Kitty Hawk. (Dec. 17, 1903). But, again, as late as 1905, the Scientific American suggested the happening was a hoax - two years after the event which changed history. Let's reflect for a moment on the fact that only in a single lifetime, man has journeyed from Kitty Hawk to the surface of the moon! The analogy to the problem of alternative energies and their development is, of course, obvious. We try to educate the preaching orthodoxies. But orthodox solutions are no longer enough. Our system of education can only give from http://www.cheniere.org/books/newteslaem/p23.htm (1 of 2)24.11.2003 21:37:02"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"~LWF0000 the past. The present must operate on inspiration and intuition, or the future will be lost. The past no longer has enough of the answers for arising crises for which there are no precedents. To keep pace with the requirements of the future, we must begin to teach not only what to learn, but how to learn, how to analyze, how to search for the truth. Only then will be able to recognize discrepancies between experiment and dogma and to cope with problems which appear to be just beyond the corner. History has shown again and again that no single individual can rise above the species without being persecuted. The reasons for that are: Some of the most powerful forces in homo sapiens have always been Greed, Pride, Ego, Fear and, above all, the Desire to Control Others,  .
