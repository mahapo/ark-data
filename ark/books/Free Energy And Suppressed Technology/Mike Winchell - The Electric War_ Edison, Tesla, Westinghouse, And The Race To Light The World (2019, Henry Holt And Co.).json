The time period of the late nineteenth century when innovationhad become big business, the next colossal invention could belong to anyone, andsociety itself was the battleground. The United States had established itself asan industrial superpower, leading many to say the country was run more by thepatent office than by the government.But with this boom in innovation, man was pitted against man, and a cutthroatrace was on to create the newest and most profound advancements in civilizationsince the wheel, like the light bulb and electric current. Be the first, andfame and fortune were yours. Be the second, and nothing, just anonymity andwishful thinking. Sabotage, conspiracy, scandal, public execution … everythingwas fair play on the Gilded Age battlefield, which matched genius againstgenius, scholar against scholar. Winner takes all.With this as a backdrop, the key showdown found Thomas Edison and his firmlyestablished direct current system of electricity pitted head-to-head againstNikola Tesla and George Westinghouse and their innovative and experimentalalternating current system. The stakes were as high as they could be, since bothsides knew almost every new invention that came along would be powered bywhichever system won the battle. And since everything was turning to electricpower, whoever won this competition would virtually run the world.This is the story of three prominent men of the Gilded Age: Thomas Edison,Nikola Tesla, and George Westinghouse. It’s about who they were as individuals,what they did to advance society, how they worked to hone and improve theirinventions, and ultimately, what they did to try to best their competition andwin the battle.With regard to the treatment of animals represented in this book, the depictionsportrayed will understandably be disturbing to many readers. Today we havestrict laws pertaining to the humane treatment of animals. During the GildedAge, however, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals(ASPCA) was still relatively young in its development, having only beenestablished in 1866. The descriptions of animal abuse by Harold P. Brown andothers in this book are an unfortunate reminder of two realities of the GildedAge. First, it signified the dire need to strengthen the laws and regulations tohelp protect animals from abuse. Second, it showed the lengths these men wouldgo to in the name of competition.While the narrative chronicles the forces that drove these titans to the heightof their craft, there is much more to share than the formative experiences andupbringing of each inventor. After all, history sometimes shines the spotlighton one character, leaving others in the dark. As such, this book will shed lighton the extreme measures taken by Thomas Edison to win the race at all costs, andit will also attempt to give credit where it is due: to Nikola Tesla, amisunderstood scientific genius who cared not as much about the bottom line ashe did about sharing his creations with the world."},{"pageContent":" 1 THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM [contents.xhtml#c_ch1]August 4, 1890, 10:00 p.m.Auburn Prison, Upstate New YorkWilliam Kemmler was a rat in a cage, trapped in an experiment he barelyunderstood. He sat on his cot, staring into the small amount of space aroundhim. A cell does not afford much freedom of movement nor allow a prisoner’s gazeto travel beyond the close walls that hold him tight. With bars on one side,brick and concrete on the other three, Kemmler chose brick over iron for hismeditation, fixing his eyes on a stained portion of wall that was much like therest.Guards appeared often, peering into his cell intently, though not expectingmuch. The convict had been placed on suicide watch, but he’d never shown anyinclination to harm himself. The watch was a matter of routine and had becomemandatory as the expected date of execution grew closer. How much closer,Kemmler didn’t know. He knew only that sometime between August 3 and August 9 hewas to be put to death for the heinous crime he had committed.* * *March 29, 1889, 8:00 a.m.526 South Division Street, Buffalo, New YorkIt was neighbor Mary Reid who received the first confession from ablood-drenched William Kemmler, a twenty-eight-year-old vegetable peddler.Staggering into Mrs. Reid’s kitchen, the drunk man exclaimed, “I’ve killed her!”Reid screamed hysterically, not sure how to take Kemmler’s claim. She, likeother neighbors, had grown used to hearing violent arguments between William andhis wife, Matilda “Tillie” Ziegler. Kemmler was drunk. This was no surprise,even at the early morning hour, but this time he was covered in blood.Kemmler rushed out of the kitchen and then reappeared moments later with hisfour-year-old daughter, Ella. The girl cried uncontrollably, splashes of bloodon her clothing. Mrs. Reid knew it was true.A subdued William Kemmler did not resist when taken into custody less than anhour later.[../images/electricwar_fig1.jpg]William Kemmler, the first man condemned to death by electricity, New YorkHeraldThe crime scene was gruesome. On the hay-covered kitchen floor, in a dark redpuddle, was a small hatchet. Twenty-six gashes covered the woman’s skull. Fivesevere fractures highlighted the damage to the woman’s head, her right arm hadfive substantial cuts, and both shoulders had large gashes. Dr. Blackman, theunfortunate gentleman called to inspect the victim at the scene, said it was theworst case he had ever been asked to examine.At the police station the next day, a hungover William Kemmler was honest withthe Buffalo police. “I wanted to kill her,” Kemmler admitted. “And I am ready tohang for it.”A moment later, with little more to add, he asked for a glass of whiskey. He wasdenied.Kemmler very well might have been ready to die for his crime, but he would notdie by hanging. Instead, the only ties that would bind him would be ones thatwould hold him down. Restraints. Capital punishment had just been turned over toscience, and the entire world was talking about this historic news. But Kemmlerwas illiterate and often intoxicated, so he’d had no clue of the momentouschange. A victim of bad timing, William Kemmler—soon to be called a “hatchetfiend” by the press—would be the first to die in the new vehicle of capitalpunishment: the electric chair.* * *August 5, 1890, 1:00 a.m.Auburn Prison, Upstate New YorkPrison chaplain Horatio Yates and Reverend Dr. Houghton walked close together inthe near-empty corridor, not a word uttered between them. They arrived atWilliam Kemmler’s dark cell, where the prison guards had to shake the man fromsleep.Kemmler had seen these two men more than a few times over the last severalweeks, but a visit in the darkness of night could mean only one thing. The twoholy men solemnly informed Kemmler, still prone on his cot, that the time of hisexecution had been set for 6:00 a.m. the following day, August 6, 1890. Kemmlernodded calmly, turned away, and stared at the brick wall.It had been a long time coming, and at least, finally, the man who would be thefirst to die in the electric chair knew when it would all come to an end.In the morning he’d be set free by the hands of death. It was the mostcomforting thought he’d ever had. He closed his eyes and fell asleep."},{"pageContent":" 2 THE FIRST SPARK [contents.xhtml#c_ch2]To start a fire, three crucial elements are needed. There’s heat, like a bolt oflightning that sparks upon contact and holds the potential for a flame. But aspark alone simply flitters and then harmlessly peters out. So fuel is needed totake the spark, hold it, and activate the heat, like cardboard or wood or someother material that—when it interacts and combines with heat—causes a reaction.Add a third element in the form of an oxidizing agent, usually oxygen, and theheat and fuel and oxygen mix and combust into a steady blaze.Fire.Remove any one of the three elements, and a fire can be avoided or extinguished,like applying water to lower the temperature and disperse the heat. This chainreaction, this fire, can continue to build if the three elements remain inplace, as the heat will continue to expand as it comes into contact with morefuel—like a flame jumping from tree to tree in a forest—all the while surroundedby the oxygen in the air.William Kemmler had become fuel without his knowledge, just another object tofeed a fire that had started long before, when three elements had combined tobecome a combustible force.* * *August 7, 1881, 10:00 p.m.Brush Electric Company, Ganson Street, Buffalo, New YorkGeorge Lemuel Smith was the heat—the first spark that started the fire WilliamKemmler would help fuel nearly a decade later.A thirty-year-old dockworker in Buffalo, George L. Smith had just spent anothernight on the town. Smith was a known alcoholic, and the end of the workday andthe setting of the sun usually triggered the call of the saloon for Smith andhis buddies. By all accounts, he was a good husband and father, and astrong-bodied man, but prone to temptation and gambling with friends.Earlier that evening, Smith and three of his friends had reportedly visited theBrush Electric Company plant on Ganson Street. This was not odd; many peoplefrom near and far made the visit to Brush Electric.The plant had been open for a year, built to power the blinding arc lightsaround the area, which had helped Buffalo develop a reputation as a center oftechnology and progress. This structure was massive in scale, housing multipledynamos and generators that held and distributed electric power, which the worldwasn’t completely familiar—or comfortable—with at the time. To help ease thetownsfolk’s minds and ensure that this was not a place to be feared, the plantwas built with public relations in mind, and visitors were routinely welcomedinside to view the marvel of modern technology.Just inside the main door, a large generator had become a showpiece for theplant, with many visitors crowding around it during business hours to see themachine at work. As more and more people had come, word had spread that if youheld on to the three-foot-high railing that surrounded the generator, you couldfeel a surge jump from generator to railing to your body. It was a harmlesstickling sensation along the skin, one that elicited laughter and smiles inthose who experimented with the little game.Brush Electric security guards and staff did not encourage or promote thisactivity, but groups of tourists would simply wait until the generator was leftunattended. Then these eager visitors would hold hands, trailing the surgeharmlessly from the person in contact with the railing to all the others, likean electrified human chain that snaked around the room.Smith and his three friends had kicked off their night on the town by visitingBrush Electric, holding the railing to experience the surge. But after hittingthe saloon and spending hour upon hour downing drink after drink, Smith decidedto head back to Brush Electric to “stop the generator,” as one of his friendslater reported Smith had said.Smith made his way to the building, but his first attempt was thwarted when themanager of the plant, G. W. Chaffee, chased him off. And the following couple ofattempts went much the same way, as other attendants forced him to vacate thepremises. But the inebriated man was stubborn and stayed hidden in the darkness,watching and waiting for a final opportunity to make it to the generator.When Chaffee was forced to look after another generator inside the plant and thepolice officer and other attendants had walked away from the main door, Smithplaced one hand on the side of the generator, expecting the tingling surge he’dfelt many times before while holding the railing.Nothing.He lowered his other hand to the other side of the generator, sandwiching thepowerful monster in a sort of drunken hug. His body went stiff upon contact—hishug giving way to a statuesque pose of an incredibly upright and well-posturedman.The attendants saw Smith’s body stiff as a board and quickly rushed to his aid.They tried to pry his body away from the generator but found his hands stuckfirmly to the machine, as if a magnetic force had taken hold. Soon after, theyhad the generator shut down, and Smith’s body slumped lifelessly to the ground.Chaffee and other witnesses claimed Smith had died instantly, no suffering andno cries of pain, and not so much as a small flame or burn left on his body.An autopsy by Dr. Joseph Fowler in the following days determined Smith had diedupon contact with the generator, Fowler officially listing the cause of death as“paralysis of the nerves of respiration.” He confirmed there had been no burningskin or tissue damage, supporting witness accounts that no flame or spark hadharmed the man’s body.* * *Alfred P. Southwick was the fuel—the first source to harness the heat from thespark created by George L. Smith’s death.A dentist by trade, Southwick would not have seemed the most logical person toinvent a device that utilized the raw power of electricity. But given the timeperiod, when life was changing quickly and technology advancing by the day,Southwick, like many people of the era, kept his finger on the pulse of theinnovative boom around him.Southwick, a faculty member of the University of Buffalo Dental School, hadturned to dentistry later than most, at the age of thirty-six, having been anengineer at the Great Lakes Steamboat Company and then the chief engineer at theWestern Transit Company. He published a few scholarly articles on steam enginedesign and had participated in scientific discussion groups. His experience asan engineer allowed him to experiment with electricity for practical use, andhis interest in the science of electrical current continued even after hischange in occupation.As he turned to dentistry, Southwick displayed an inventive mind, designing aneffective implant for a cleft palate. He also successfully employed alow-voltage electric current as a numbing agent during oral surgery. Hisrecognition as a leader in the dental field grew.When Dr. Fowler had presented his findings to a group of amateur scientists inthe days following Smith’s autopsy, it didn’t take long for the inquisitivedentist to get lost in a whirlwind of wonder after learning that George L. Smithhad died instantly by way of the high-voltage exposure, without pain orsuffering. Southwick’s mind went to work, and he settled on the idea of usingelectricity as a more humane mode of execution.The timing was right, as hanging had been attacked as inhumane, with bungledexecutions piling up and the news sprinkling over the public. New York governorDavid B. Hill felt the pressure and called on the scientific community to find amore modern method of execution, stating that “the present mode of executingcriminals by hanging has come down to us from the dark ages.”Alfred P. Southwick knew he had a better method. But he was a dentist, not ascientist. What ground did he stand on to recommend the use of electricity toreplace hanging? He had to be able to show proof that electricity was a moreinstant, painless, and civilized means of death.The dentist-turned-inventor soon teamed up with Buffalo physician George Fell indesigning a device to euthanize animals, namely dogs. In 1887, the two enteredinto an agreement with the Buffalo SPCA to conduct experiments on stray dogs,which had begun to overwhelm the city of Buffalo to the point where there was atwenty-five-cent bounty on each stray turned in. Southwick and Fell, the SPCAhoped, could supply a humane method of getting rid of the many strays that hadto be dealt with.Their crude design included a “box” filled with an inch of water, with wiresfrom an arc light dipping down into the bottom. Dogs were led inside and, by allaccounts, were killed instantly by the high-voltage charge. It wasn’t longbefore Southwick and Fell began designing a chair, modeled after a dentist’schair, to help solve the problem of replacing the “primitive” method of hangingwith a more “civilized” mode of execution.At the same time, Governor Hill was under fire more each day with the continuedpublic fiascos that took place at the gallows. The public was looking to thegovernor for answers. Governor Hill, who had an eye for the new inventionspopping up around the world, claimed science could provide a method that was“less barbarous” than hanging.Alfred P. Southwick heard Governor Hill’s call. He knew this was hisopportunity, so he turned to his longtime friend and current state senator,Daniel McMillan. Southwick convinced McMillan to introduce a bill to investigatethe “most humane and approved method” of execution. This bill was passed in1886, and a commission was appointed, originally made up of three men: Alfred P.Southwick himself, Albany lawyer Matthew Hale, and the commodore of the New YorkYacht Club, Elbridge T. Gerry. The group was dubbed the Gerry Commission,although it was more often referred to as the “Death Commission.”After studying the history of hanging as a means of execution, the GerryCommission concluded that there was a definite need for a “speedier and moremerciful” mode of execution. This commission listened to, experimented with, andconsidered many alternatives, at first leaning toward an overdose of morphine byinjection as the top alternative. However, the contentions were that peoplereacted differently to poisons, with some dying instantly, while others endureda more prolonged death. Additionally, the hypodermic needle was a new device inmedicine, and since it was being widely introduced in general practice,physicians did not want the public to develop a negative association forneedles. In the end, the Gerry Commission concluded that death by electrocutionwas the best alternative, as it incorporated the symbol ofmodernization—electricity—with the need to maintain a civilized society.The American public, though, balked at Southwick’s invention: this “chair ofdeath.” The science of electricity, after all, was so new and temperamental. Whytrust a dentist, even if he was a member of the “Death Commission”?[../images/electricwar_fig2.jpg]The first electric chair, used in 1890, in the execution of William KemmlerThe Gerry Commission wasn’t enough to win over the public. Southwick needed anexpert to back him and lend credibility to the chair.He needed Thomas Edison.* * *Thomas Edison was the oxidizing agent—the missing third ingredient needed tocreate a combustible combination in the form of the functional electric chair.Just over a decade earlier, Edison had wowed the world with his invention of thephonograph, launching him to instant celebrity status. The man who became knownas the father of invention, along with his team of like-minded inventors at hislab in Menlo Park, didn’t stop with the phonograph but instead introduced otherinventions, including the invention he’d become synonymous with: the light bulb.An early patent on the design of an incandescent light bulb in 1878 had stavedoff competitors, but Edison and his team at Menlo Park could not perfect acost-effective, long-lasting bulb for practical use, despite focusing allefforts on the invention. It wasn’t just a bulb that was needed—it was a systemof powering it. Finally, two years after the initial bulb prototype and patenteddesign, Edison had designed and mass-produced a long-lasting bulb, one thatutilized his own patented system of electric current: direct current.Direct current (DC) is essentially a one-way street for electricity. The powersource, like a battery, gives off power, called electrons, and sends it in onedirection. This direction of electron flow is called its circuit. Theelectricity follows its unidirectional circuit until it reaches the utility,like a light bulb, and it receives power. With direct current, the circuitcontinues on to the next utility, like an outlet connected to a toaster, andthen on to the next utility and then the next. On a large scale, a powergenerator sends electrons through its circuit to one residence and then the nextand the next. The problem with direct current is that the amount of power—thestrength of the electrons—weakens the farther away from the power source itgets. Therefore, the farther away a house is from a large generator, the weakerits power will be. This means direct current requires more power sources spacedout from block to block of a big city in order to supply power to everyone. Evenso, the residence farthest away, like one on the outskirts of town, wouldreceive less power than those closer to town.This means direct current was expensive and required a lot of wiring, machinery,and generators that had to be distributed every few city blocks. Costs piled up,and electric light became less for the masses and more for the elite class.Still, parts of New York were lit up by Edison’s direct current, and progresswas shining down on society.[../images/electricwar_fig3.jpg]Thomas Alva EdisonCompetition also surfaced in the form of alternating current (AC), a system thatwas designed and patented by Nikola Tesla, a former employee of Edison’s, andthen bought and mass-produced by inventor and businessman George Westinghouse,who became the public figure in direct opposition to Thomas Edison. Alternatingcurrent was less expensive and much more aesthetically pleasing than directcurrent. It required only one large dynamo located on the edge of town, andcurrent traveled back and forth along a single wire.Alternating current involves a power source, like a generator, that gives offelectricity that reverses—or alternates—direction multiple times. This currentalternates direction sixty times per second in American AC systems. Alternatingcurrent fed through a transformer allows the strength of the electricity to beadjusted, which means the voltage can be tailored specifically for the devicebeing powered. Another key difference between AC and DC is that AC’sbidirectional current makes it more suitable for long-distance transmission thanDC electricity, so that a residence on the edge of town will receive the sameamount of power as one directly next to the power source. This means the ACsystem needs far fewer power generators than the DC system.Edison had engaged in battle with his competition, and he was losing in thecourt of public opinion. Edison was a savvy businessman, and he knew that notjust light would rely on the most effective and commercial system of electriccurrent—everything would. He was desperate, willing to do anything to prove hissystem was the logical—and safe—choice.Enter Alfred P. Southwick and the electric chair.On behalf of the Gerry Commission, Southwick had written to Edison twice to seekadvice and his endorsement of the electric chair. At first, these letters wentunanswered. Until, finally, Edison ran out of ammunition to fight off hiscompetition.The electric chair, Edison determined, was the artillery he had been waitingfor. In 1888, Thomas Edison endorsed the use of electricity as a more humanemethod of execution, but only if alternating current—since he claimed it was sodeadly—was the method of electric current employed. Edison would even recommendthat the act of electrocution as capital punishment be termed “beingWestinghoused,” directly stamping his main competitor’s name into theconsciousness of the public. Doing so would make it unmistakable thatalternating current was a killer—an instant killer.Edison allowed his name to be tied to the creation of the electric chair. It wasa bold move. But this man, Edison, had always been a gambler."},{"pageContent":" 3 WHAT’S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE … [contents.xhtml#c_ch3]Thomas Alva Edison, known as “Al” in his early years, had always possessed aburning sense of curiosity that mixed, often dangerously, with a blindwillingness to take risks.Born on February 11, 1847, in Milan, Ohio—a burgeoning town thanks to the MilanCanal, built to make traveling the twisting, turning Huron River manageable forthe many ships carrying wheat—young Al Edison’s curiosity nearly killed him afew times over. Like a cat, Al seemed to have nine lives, and his inquisitive,reckless nature did its best to use up each life quickly.Young Al was amazed at the sights and sounds all around him. And like manychildren who find themselves confused, Al turned to asking “Why?” and “How?” Andask he did, so much so, in fact, that his father admitted to being embarrassedby his son’s silly questions. But when no answers satisfied Al’s inquiring mind,the small boy took to personal inspection to find his own answers. Firsthandexperience was his solution to the myriad unanswered questions.Just before he turned five years old, Al was so curious about a grain elevatorthat he crept closer and closer until he fell in. Luckily, he was snatched by analert worker and yanked out of the quicksand-like grain after being submergedfor a few moments. If the worker had been a second slower, that lifesaving handwould have been unable to help young Al.Al also spent some of his nine lives falling into the Milan Canal, like manyboys his age had done. But unlike the other boys, who just wanted to get nearthe water or were carelessly playing too close to the water’s edge, what drew Aldangerously close was the canal’s construction and practicality, along with thecomplex and varied ships that used the man-made waterway.[../images/electricwar_fig4.jpg]Young Thomas Alva EdisonWhen he was six, Al noticed a goose resting atop its eggs. The boy pondered thegoose’s egg-rearing practice and the eventual end result. He desperately wantedto see the eggs hatch, but just as curiosity served as a weakness, so didimpatience. If only there was a way to make those eggs hatch sooner. Al becamelost in introspection and developed a theory. The next day, Al’s mother, NancyEdison, found him sitting atop the eggs. His mother beckoned him to get off theeggs, grabbed his arm, and pulled him away from the mother goose, who washonking loudly in protest. Mrs. Edison—amused but concerned—asked her son why hewas doing such a thing. Al’s reply was one of logic. If the heat and mass of themother goose’s rump helped to hatch the eggs, surely a larger rear end—like hisown—would expedite the process? Mrs. Edison could only shake her head at herson’s naive but intuitive sense of reasoning.While Al’s early inquisitive urges threatened his own well-being, as he grewolder they became more dangerous to those around him as well. In the family’sfinal year living in Milan, Al decided he wanted to know how hay burned. Is itquick-burning? How does it smell? Does the flame jump to neighboring objectsonce it has used up the hay, or does it peter out and extinguish itself? He knewasking his father these questions would, as usual, lead to both his father’sfrustration and an ultimate dead end, so Al decided to light some hay on fire inhis father’s barn. The blaze grew so quickly and spread so expansively that thebarn was a total loss. Al had the answer he’d craved, but it had cost his familydearly in the form of a barn. If that weren’t enough, Al was dragged to thevillage square by his father and publicly whipped as a lesson to him and otheryouths.When Al was seven, the family moved to Port Huron, Michigan. The growing andendlessly branching limbs of railroad tracks had expanded to Ohio and the HuronRiver and had taken over as the primary means of commercial travel. The MilanCanal and the town itself had outlived its usefulness—run over by the modernrailway.Port Huron promised more opportunities for the Edison family and offered Al achance at a formal education. His public schooling was fleeting, though, andcame to an abrupt end a mere three months after it had begun when his teacherReverend G. B. Engle described Al as “addled” and claimed he was unteachable.Mrs. Edison, having been a teacher in Canada before the family’s move to the US,promptly took to homeschooling her son. Nancy Edison recognized her son’s uniquemind and knew how to tap into and make use of his individual learning style. Infact, an adult Thomas Edison would later conclude about his mother, “If it hadnot been for her appreciation and her faith in me at a critical time in myexperience, I should very likely never have become an inventor.”With his mother’s encouragement, Al questioned and experimented. Questioned somemore. Experimented some more. It was a way of life for Al, who was growing bothphysically and intellectually. Around the age of ten, Al became particularlycurious about chemistry, his cellar serving as a laboratory. This made perfectsense for young Edison, for although he read widely and enjoyed the process oflearning through the written word, he learned early on that “doing the thingitself is what counts.” With that in mind, Al quickly built up a collection ofnearly two hundred bottles and containers, which he painstakingly shelved, eachlabeled “Poison” to scare others from handling his prized ingredients. Mrs.Edison allowed her son to experiment in the cellar but worried about the resultsand therefore kept a close eye on Al’s undertakings. Perhaps the smoke from theburning barn in Milan had followed the family and had not quite lifted highenough to clear the air.It seemed the older he got, the more Al’s curiosity impacted others. Just beforehis eleventh birthday, Al convinced his childhood acquaintance, a boy by thename of Michael Oates, to do an experiment with Seidlitz, a powdery chemicalthat turns to gas when mixed with water. Seeing the powder + water = weightlessgas reaction, Al instructed Oates to ingest a large quantity of Seidlitz,theorizing that the powder would turn to gas when it came into contact withwater in the boy’s stomach, which in turn would result in the boy floating intothe air like a balloon. The Human Balloon Experiment, of course, didn’t pan outas Edison had planned. Instead, the failed experiment resulted in a very sickOates and (after Mrs. Edison had taken a switch to him) a very sore Al Edison.Experimenting with chemicals also had another consequence: cost. These chemicalsand essential ingredients weren’t free. If Al wanted to keep up with hisexperiments, he needed to make money. Eleven-year-old Al Edison soon gained theopportunity to use a horse and wagon to run a relatively large market garden forthe Edison family. After doing his share of hoeing corn and working the land, Alwould load the wagon with corn, lettuce, and other vegetables to sell to peoplearound town. The enterprise was a success. In fact, Al even took on an employee,Michael Oates, that same boy who had agreed to become the first human-balloonguinea pig. Along with Oates, Al took to business kindly and made a steadyprofit, though he had no interest in saving any of his money. Instead, everypenny was put into his experiments.With a taste for business but a disdain for physical labor in the hot sun, Allooked around and noticed everything was turning toward the railroad. GrandTrunk Railway was carving its tracks all around him, putting down roots not justin Port Huron and neighboring areas but all over the world. Things were movingquickly. Change was a wildfire. And Al knew he had to hop aboard and go in thedirection the world was moving or else he’d risk being left behind.So at the age of twelve, Al begged his mother to allow him to become a newsboy,selling papers and other goods on the Grand Trunk train that traveled from PortHuron to Detroit. When she said no, he begged some more. She said no again. Hebegged again. Al was relentless. When Mrs. Edison finally gave in, each day Altraveled the local train’s sixty-three-mile route from seven in the morning tonine at night. For the next two years, Al sold newspapers, vegetables, butter,and anything that could help turn a profit. Al also worked as a candy butcher,selling sweets to passengers on the train. During this time, he developed hisskills and natural abilities as a salesman and entrepreneur. Making use of hisexperience with Michael Oates, Al took on other boys as employees and improvedhis profits, which, all told, resulted in around eight to ten dollars a day,most of which went directly toward his chemistry obsession; he moved hislaboratory from his cellar to an unused baggage-car compartment on the train.When the Civil War broke out, Al saw the market of the written word becomeprosperous, especially on the Grand Trunk Railway, so he gave up his vegetablestore and focused on the newspaper business. People were hurrying their waythrough life; spare time was a commodity. The train ride was a small amount oftime for passengers to, in whatever way possible, “catch up” with the chaoticworld around them. Al sold newspapers as fast as he could acquire them anddeveloped a method of reading and judging the news in advance to decide how manypapers to buy and sell.On April 6, 1862, the Battle of Shiloh had a direct and extreme impact on hisbusiness. When Al arrived at the stop in Detroit, a large crowd surrounded thestation bulletin board, where a message explained that thousands had been killedand wounded. The savvy newsboy “knew that if the same excitement was attained atvarious small towns along the road, and especially at Port Huron, the sale ofpapers would be great.” Al moved quickly, working his contacts so that he—withthe help of a bribe of free papers for the next three months—talked thetelegraph operator into posting the news on the blackboard at each station. Thismeant that right alongside the arrival and departure times, passengers saw thebrief news report teasing them with information about the Battle of Shiloh.Edison then went to the Detroit Free Press and convinced them to give him onethousand copies instead of his regular amount of one hundred, even though hedidn’t have the money to pay for all the papers. Traveling from station tostation, he sold the papers quickly. So quickly, in fact, that as the supplydwindled he charged more for each paper, going from the initial amount of fivecents up to ten, reaching a pinnacle of twenty-five cents for his last fewcopies. Business boomed for the young newsboy.During those negotiating sessions at the Detroit Free Press, Al had observed thenewspaper trade and had grown fond of it. He had become so enamored that hedecided to create his own periodical. Al secured old parts and spare materialsfrom his visits to the offices of the Detroit Free Press to make the equipmenthe needed. He then turned part of his baggage car into a printing press,starting the Grand Trunk’s very own Weekly Herald, which featured local news andgossip that was written by Al himself. He sold a generous number of what wasconsidered a substantial periodical for three cents a copy, or eight cents for amonthly subscription. He was not even fifteen years old at the time.Eventually, his mobile laboratory would spell disaster when a shoddy section oftrack resulted in a jostling train, which ended in a stick of phosphorus fallingto the floor and bursting into flames. Al was banished from the train at thenext stop by an irate conductor, who Edison claims gave him a severe whack onthe side of his head that resulted in his loss of hearing. Though, in truth,Edison’s hearing impairment was present from an early age and got progressivelyworse over time.This deafness, regardless of whether it was a direct result of the enragedconductor or had been present at birth, was viewed by Edison as a “greatadvantage … in various ways.” He’d attribute his deafness to helping his futuresuccess with telegraphy, the vocation of choice that followed his newspaperbusiness, and with his invention of the phonograph later on.Meanwhile, a constant throughout Edison’s childhood and teenage years wasreading. He was a regular at the library, and according to Edison himself, “Istarted with the first book on the bottom shelf and went through the lot, one byone. I didn’t read a few books. I read the library.” While his father wasn’tsupportive of his dabbling in chemistry or his new obsession with telegraphy, hedid support his son when it came to reading. In fact, he paid Al a penny to readbooks of “serious literature,” starting with Thomas Paine’s Age of Reason.Al’s laboratory moved back to his cellar, and although his occupational effortscontinued with the Weekly Herald for a short time afterward, they soon gave wayto telegraphy, the long-distance transmission of electromagnetic waves throughthe air to communicate text and symbols. It was a natural progression for Al,for in his long time on the train as a candy butcher and newsboy, he had becomeenthralled by the machine shops that peppered the railway stations. He loved thegears in motion, the valves, and the levers that controlled various apparatus,and everything related to the locomotive’s design and inner workings. Along withthis machinery, Al noticed that everywhere he went he saw the telegraph at work.This invention, he knew, was something to invest in—both with time and money.Al the telegrapher was a quick study, and like most of hispassions-turned-occupations, the majority of his skill and talent came about byteaching himself through trial and error. But he could only learn so much on hisown. He hung around the telegraph office to pick up what he could, but the boywho had a million questions as a toddler had just as many when it came totelegraphy.Fate intervened and set Al on the path toward his ultimate destiny one day whilehe was standing among the tracks at a train station. As a boxcar was given apush to move it in the desired direction, a lone boy appeared on the tracks,playing without a care in the world. Al threw down his things and rushed towardthe boy, scooped him up, and brought him to safety.Turns out, the boy was the child of the station telegrapher, James Mackenzie,who had wandered away to receive a message and had lost track of his son. Torepay his son’s savior, Mackenzie offered to take Al under his wing and teachhim professional telegraphy.Al became addicted with his first lesson from Mackenzie, and after ten days heretreated to his cellar with a collection of equipment and succeeded in buildinghis very own telegraph key, a device that actually sends the telegraph. Hisyears watching the machinists and mechanics around the railway had served himwell, and Al became even more dedicated. After five months, Al had learnedenough from Mackenzie to become a professional telegrapher, called a “plug.”This classification essentially gave him a badge to work anywhere along the railline, even though he was only sixteen years old. Al began roaming the country asan itinerant (traveling) operator, taking jobs all over and gaining valuableexperience. It was around this time that he decided to drop his childhood nameof “Al” and began introducing himself as “Thomas” at each site.Thomas Edison preferred night shifts for a couple of reasons. First, he hadalways felt nighttime was the period of greatest concentration, not just for himbut for those of the critical-thinking and inventive ilk. And second, he wantedto work night hours to allow himself more time to read, since there was lesstraffic over the wire, and also to have time to learn about the telegraph itselfthrough inspection and experimentation. This method allowed Edison to advancehis knowledge on telegraph technology and electrical science while he worked.For five years Edison worked all over the country and became a first-rateitinerant telegraph operator. He was chummy with his fellow operators, which wasmore like a fraternity than a group of coworkers, and he enjoyed the friendlycompetition and also engaged in being quite the prankster. Things were good forEdison. The problem was: his hearing loss was getting worse with each passingday. Although he considered his deafness a benefit to his work as a telegraphoperator because it drowned out the external noises and focused him on theclicks over the wire, his hearing needed to be good enough to pick up even thefaintest transmission. His degenerating hearing was making his job moredifficult. But, like when he’d saved the young Mackenzie child, fate stepped inand set Edison on the proper course.After a group of men had seen an advertisement claiming telegraph operators werein demand in Brazil, they chartered a steamer and invited Edison to come withthem. Edison abruptly quit his job and set out to join them. Not much is knownabout why Edison made the decision to leave the country. Perhaps his hearingloss was worse than he had let on. In the end, though, his plans changed when ariot in New Orleans delayed the trip. There, as young Edison waited to continuehis trek to another lifestyle, a man told him that only in the US could someonebring out his full worth and achieve greatness. The man continued his commentaryby saying any man who believed some other place had a better life in store forhim was a “damned fool.” Young Thomas Edison left the steamer and returned toPort Huron, the man’s voice echoing in his head.Soon after, Edison moved to Boston, which was considered the center of Americanscience and invention, where he secured a job at the Western Union office,thanks to his close friend Milton Adams, whom Edison had met years prior whileworking as a telegrapher in Cincinnati. The roaming telegrapher was nowstationary for the first time in half a decade, setting up shop in Boston.It was in Boston that Edison read Michael Faraday’s Experimental Researches inElectricity. He took in each word wide-eyed, captivated by the principles andtheory behind this little-known science. While he wouldn’t immediately givehimself over to learning about and experimenting with electricity, Faraday’sbook gave his mind the jolt it needed to focus on not just using technology butimproving existing devices and inventing his own.In 1868, the first in a long line of patents in Edison’s name appeared in theform of an automatic vote counter, utilizing a complex mechanical system. Itworked well, by all accounts, to the point where recording votes became an easy,accurate task. For this very reason, though, politicians despised the invention,saying they would never use such a device. When Edison gave them a blank stare,he was told, “Young man, if there is any invention on earth that we don’t wantdown here, it is this.” These congressmen had the opinion that voting should beslow, drawn-out, and complicated, because they intended to doctor the results intheir favor. If a system without any delay or hiccups were set up, there’d be noopportunity to rig elections. “It was a lesson to me,” Edison would concludelater in life. From that point on he decided to “never invent anything which wasnot wanted, or which was not necessary to the community at large.”In the January 1869 issue of the Journal of the Telegraph, an announcement read:“Thomas A. Edison, former operator, would hereafter devote his full time tobringing out his inventions.” It then referenced an article from the June 1868issue, in which it had been stated that Edison had created a “mode oftransmission both ways on a single wire,” which was now, the announcementclaimed, for sale at Charles Williams Jr.’s machine shop. Thomas Alva Edison hadbecome the first-ever inventor by trade.Becoming a full-time inventor was a risky move, one that didn’t result inimmediate success since his inventions had failed to sell, but Edison decided todouble down on his risk-taking and move to the hottest spot for business,invention, and money.A twenty-two-year-old Thomas Edison arrived in New York broke and jobless. Hehad a dollar, which he spent on food, and then accepted an offer from friendFranklin L. Pope to hole up on a cot in the battery room of the Gold IndicatorCompany, where Pope worked. Fate, as it had before, stepped in once again andrerouted Edison’s life.Edison’s lucky break involved the stock market, the place where people buy andsell stakes in a business, company, or product. A stock is a share of ownership,and the more units a person has, the more invested they are in the company orproduct. As more stock is bought, the higher the value of the business orproduct.Days after Edison arrived at the Gold Indicator Company, the central transmitterthat ran the stock ticker—which displays changes, called “ticks,” in thereported up or down movement of a company, business, or product—stopped working.Completely. This ticker was an essential component in knowing the gold prices tohelp properly advise the Gold Indicator Company’s many clients. No one could fixthe transmitter, even as bodies accumulated alongside the device and heads wereput together. The owner, Dr. Samuel Laws, saw his business crumbling rightbefore his eyes.Amid the panic, a calm, composed Thomas Edison walked up to Laws and said hecould probably fix it if the many frantic workers would clear a path and let himget to it. Laws all but shoved Edison toward the transmitter, the sea ofconfused experts parting before him.Edison had spent a good deal of time watching and studying the contraptionduring his temporary residence in the building. He’d studied its inner workings,so he had an idea what might be wrong. Edison took the cover off the transmitterand picked out a spring that had fallen in with the gears, and it was fixed. Thehum of the machinery picked back up, sighs and laughter sprinkled the room, andThomas Edison was made the chief technical advisor for Dr. Laws.In this new post, Edison let his gift for making things better shine. From thoseearly days tinkering in his cellar laboratory to selling sweet treats on therails as a candy butcher to his lesson learned with his creation of the unwantedvote recorder, the young man knew that the key was taking something—whatever itwas—and making it more useful to the public. Not because he wanted to bettersociety, but because there was more profit in making something more useful.Edison took this approach at the Gold Indicator Company when he invented aunison correcting device that stopped all stock tickers along a line and resetthem at regular intervals. Such a device was direly needed in the industrybecause mechanical problems happened every so often, with all tickers. Thisresulted in misreading the code on the line, which in turn hurt profits andcreated a higher likelihood of suffering losses. This correcting device wasquickly bought by Gold and Stock Telegraph Company for a loftyforty-thousand-dollar price, which was paid to Edison by check. However, whenEdison brought the check to the bank and they claimed it could not be cashed, heangrily went back to Gold and Stock to complain. Marshall Lefferts, thepresident of Gold and Stock, kindly informed Edison that it was necessary tosign the back of the check to endorse it first. The red-faced inventor noddedand accepted his valuable lesson from Lefferts.Things picked up in earnest for Edison as he also sold, to Western Union, whatwould become a widely used device in the form of a type-printing telegraph thatwould record and print prices of gold and silver.With another fifteen thousand dollars in his pocket thanks to the sale of thetype-print telegraph—after endorsing the check, of course—Edison set up afactory in New York. But that exciting news was quickly followed by sad newsfrom his old home in Port Huron: his mother had passed. His mother’s death hithim hard, but Edison had a different way of dealing with grief. He threw himselfinto his work. With a constantly growing staff of workers by his side, Edisonput in long hours and slept sparingly. He was a good boss, most said, the typewho didn’t ask from his workers what he didn’t put forth himself.In the early 1870s, with his New York factory humming with activity, Edison andcompany produced a slew of inventions, including a telegraph that printedmessages on a strip of paper, and a failed attempt at an underwater telegraphysystem for the British post office.While some inventions flourished and some floundered, Edison’s mind-set remainedthe same: work harder and invent more; learn from failure and use it to improve.One factory grew to three and then four, and never was there a lull in theprocess, as once an invention had reached a point of stagnation, Edison and hiscrew directed their efforts to a new project to help maintain consistencywithout losing productivity.Finding time to have a family—phrased intentionally, as Edison viewed a wife andchildren and a home as “things” one should “have,” akin to furniture andhousehold supplies—twenty-four-year-old Thomas Edison married sixteen-year-oldMary Stilwell on Christmas Day in 1871. They would go on to have three childrentogether, despite the fact that Edison rarely went home, instead opting to sleepat the factory most days and nights.Telegraphy remained a focus for Edison, leading to the invention of thequadruplex, a telegraph that sent simultaneous messages over the samewire—something it seemed every inventor was trying to do at the time. Edisonalso invented and developed the very useful automatic telegraph, which allowedthe telegrapher on the receiving end to record the message on a long strip ofpaper.Indeed, Thomas Alva Edison had built himself up from the ashes—literally, fromthe barn fire in Milan, Ohio—but he was not content with remaining where he was.This man had had a taste of success, and he wanted more."},{"pageContent":" 4 A WIZARD IS BORN [contents.xhtml#c_ch4]While the telegraph served as the springboard device that launched ThomasEdison’s career as an inventor, the electric pen was the invention that removedthe chains that had held him tightly to the telegraph. It served as an epiphanythat there was more to be had in this game of invention, and when it came toprofit, he knew, “There is more money in this [invention] than telegraphy.”The idea of the electric pen actually came about because of the printingtelegraph, which had left a trail of chemical solution on the paper as itrecorded messages. Edison determined that if he could use a small needle toperforate the sheet of paper, it would create a stencil of what had beenwritten. Then the stencil was placed in the press and a roller was used to runink through the holes in the stencil, which created a copy of the document. Itwas the earliest form of a copying device and went on to be used for the nextcentury, until the birth of the Xerox machine rendered it obsolete. Moreimportant to Edison, this innovation was something different from the telegraph,and it signaled to him that there was an opportunity in inventing on a full-timebasis. Thomas Edison the full-time inventor was open for business.[../images/electricwar_fig41.jpg]Edison’s electric penBeginning with about fifteen coworkers—including his dynamic promoter EdwardJohnson, chief machinist “Honest” John Kruesi, and right-hand man CharlesBatchelor—Edison set up shop in Menlo Park, New Jersey, a place barely listed onthe map at the time. Although he was not yet thirty years old, he was oftenreferred to as “the Old Man” by his employees.Menlo Park became invention headquarters, or as Edison himself called it, his“invention factory.” Edison’s three-story house was where his wife and childrenstayed, and it was the first building visitors encountered from the railroadstation, which in truth was merely a small wooden platform. In time, a series ofother buildings would be added to the surrounding Menlo Park estate. But Edisondid not reside in the family house as much as he did in the Menlo Parklaboratory. Along with his fraternity of inventors, Edison spent most of histime in the bustling lab.After a few months getting the building into working order—with a receptionroom, an office, and a machine shop on the lower level, and the laboratory onthe upper floor—Edison and his invention factory began working in earnest in May1876. Averaging some twenty working hours per day, accompanied by catnaps hereand there when he reached exhaustion, the trusted leader of Menlo Parkchampioned his method of producing “a minor invention every ten days and a bigthing every six months or so.”[../images/electricwar_fig5.jpg]Menlo Park laboratoryAnd so it went for over a year. Unending work inside the lab, the only downtimethe small meals the crew had together, highlighted by the “midnight suppers”they routinely held, which were more about hanging out as a group than a time tohave a solid meal.Minor inventions cropped up, the electric pen continued production, and theautomatic telegraph remained a focus. But it was another man’s invention thatwould lead to the invention Edison would later call his “baby.”Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876, though many historiansargue whether it was Bell or Elisha Gray who truly deserves credit, sinceinitial patents were filed within hours of each other. What would ultimately beconsidered Bell’s creation became a focus for Edison and his group at MenloPark.Edison took on the task of trying to improve the telephone—improvement of anexisting and successful device sometimes spelled even more profit than theinvention itself—and the result was a carbon transmitter that conducted thehuman voice more impressively than Bell’s magnetic model. The creation of hisown type of “musical telephone” allowed Edison to enter into competition withGray and Bell.It was at the intersection of the musical telephone and the automatic telegraphthat Thomas Edison would meet the invention he would later call his “baby,” thephonograph. Edison’s musical telephone allowed people to hear music even if theyweren’t where the music was being played. The automatic telegraph made itpossible to record a message—with a stylus and a strip of paper—to be read bythe operator at a later time. Those two devices were the primary factors thathelped conceive Edison’s phonograph, as it was a fusion of these two inventions.Along with the electric condenser, which included the idea of applying a coat ofwax over paper, these inventions would lead to the birth of not just Edison’s“baby” invention, the phonograph, but his status as a full-blown celebrity.* * *July 18, 1877, 12:45 a.m.Menlo Park, New JerseyMidnight supper had just wrapped up. Workers were still hanging around comparingdifferent types of diaphragms for the telephone. Without giving it much thought,the Old Man spoke into a diaphragm mounted inside a rubber mouthpiece. Hepressed his finger on the other side of the diaphragm as he spoke. Thevibrations tickled his fingertips.“Batch, if we had a point on this,” Edison said to Charles Batchelor, “we couldmake a record on some material which we could afterwards pull under the point,and it would give us speech back.”Edison’s statement of observation was a falling domino that pushed its weightinto the next, as John Kruesi soldered a needle to the middle of a diaphragm.The next domino fell when Kruesi attached the diaphragm to a stand that held oneof the automatic telegraph wheels, which toppled the neighboring domino:Batchelor cutting some strips of wax paper. From there, the line of dominoesfell quickly, culminating with a contraption that had wax paper inserted on topof a wheel, and a needle resting lightly on the paper.The Old Man sat and lowered his chin to the mouthpiece. As Batchelor tugged thepaper, Edison pronounced what had become the standard phrase the lab used totest different diaphragms: “Mary had a little lamb.”Everyone crowded together and looked at the paper, which now held marks on it.Batchelor grinned and placed the paper at the beginning of the wheel, carefullypositioning it beneath the stylus. With Batchelor pulling at a steady pace, theneedle ran along the marks on the paper.“Ary ad eh il am.”The place came unglued. Hands were shaken. Backs were clapped and patted. Cheersand shouts sprinkled the room.“It was not fine talking,” Batchelor would later recall, “but the shape of itwas there.”A day later—after an all-night, nonstop session that included multiple tweaksand adjustments—the Menlo Park boys celebrated at the next midnight supper afterthey succeeded in producing a clearly spoken recording.Although the first public announcement of the invention, which still didn’t havean official name, wouldn’t happen until a month later, Edward Johnson—MenloPark’s PR man—told the Philadelphia Record that the brilliant inventor ThomasEdison had created a device “by which a speech can be recorded while it is beingdelivered on prepared paper” and then “redeliver[ed]” using the same paper atany time later on.It would take some time for Edison to present his “baby” to the public in anofficial manner. In November 1877, Johnson wrote to the editor of ScientificAmerican about the invention. Johnson included an engraved illustration to goalong with his detailed letter, both showing and telling the general publicabout the workings of “the apparatus.”Soon after, on December 7, Edison himself brought a newly named phonograph intothe offices of Scientific American and mystified the editors with ademonstration. Edison later explained: “I … set up the machine and recited,‘Mary had a little lamb,’ etc. Then I reproduced it so that it could be heardall over the room. They kept me at it until the crowd got so great Mr. Beach[the editor] was afraid the floor would collapse.” In the next issue, ScientificAmerican recounted for its readers: “The machine inquired as to our health,asked how we liked the phonograph, informed us that it was very well, and bid usa cordial good night.”If the term “went viral” had existed in Edison’s time, it would have been an aptdescription for the manner in which news of the phonograph spread across theworld. In both Europe and the US, people dreamed about and marveled at the manypossible uses of Edison’s latest invention. Perhaps remembering the manner inwhich his automatic vote counter had been slapped down so viciously by thecongressmen who had seen it in action, Edison took great care in deciding howbest to market and sell this new invention. In late November, the Old Man andhis team settled on the idea that the phonograph’s greatest commercial potentialwas as a device for entertainment.Edison’s phonograph launched him into the stratosphere, so much so that hebecame a household name, synonymous with the idea of science and invention. Theman whose formal education had been limited to a measly three months became arenowned scientist. His opinion was sought-after by businessmen, scientists, andwriters.It wasn’t just Edison’s phonograph that had been born; his reputation and statusas a bona fide celebrity had taken form as well. And, having risen so quicklyand so monumentally, Thomas Edison had no desire to be pushed down from hiscomfortable perch atop the mountain. Staying there, he knew, would be a battle.Journalists came to Menlo Park in droves following the reveal of the phonograph,and Edison welcomed them with open arms. Reporters wanted to know about theamazing phonograph, of course, but they also wanted to know about the intriguinginventor, this Wizard of Menlo Park, as he was later called by reporter WilliamCroffut of the New York Daily Graphic.Amos Cummings, a reporter for the New York Sun, visited Menlo Park andchronicled his experience for readers, giving an intimate glimpse of Edison,rounding out edges and defining his image for the many people who were curious.Cummings claimed, “A man of common sense would feel at home with him in aminute.” Edison opened up to Cummings and was not shy about his ideas and thegrand schemes he had in store. He detailed the many ways the phonograph andrelated devices he was working on could be used by the public, highlighted bybooks being recorded and played back, and also how people—parents andpoliticians, for example—could hide recording devices in critical areas to gaininformation. Edison seemed to speak on passing ideas that came to mind andmentioned the most incredulous devices and uses, like how he believed anaerophone, a device akin to a megaphone or foghorn on steroids, should be placedinside “the Goddess of Liberty that the Frenchmen are going to put upon Bedloe’sIsland that would make her talk so loud that she could be heard by every soul onManhattan Island.” Imagine how different a tour of the then-soon-to-be-namedStatue of Liberty would be if Edison’s idea had come to fruition.Edison and his team continued to work on a large-scale version of the phonographand a smaller, more commercial version that would be sold to the public. All thewhile, everyone wanted a piece of this new celebrity. The New York Sun bestcaptured Edison’s life: “The people have come to regard him as public property …Little knots of people came and went all day long and took possession of him andhis office and shop as if they had been personal property.”Thomas Edison needed a break, and his friend George Barker, a professor, talkedhim into a one-month trip out west. The original intent was to view a solareclipse from a spot in Wyoming, but the two ended up spending more than themonth’s time exploring the world they’d only heard of.* * *The tail end of 1878 found Edison investing most of his time in his Menlo Parklaboratory, along with his staff, focusing on the development of an incandescentlight bulb.Artificial light itself wasn’t a foreign concept, as arc lights—two carbon rodsset a distance apart and aligned vertically to create a blinding arc of lightthat bridged the gap between the rods—had been used in variation since 1855. Butthis form of light was so bright and unattractive that it didn’t appeal to mostpeople. The author Robert Louis Stevenson, in fact, described it as “a lamp fora nightmare.”Birds, too, must not have cared for the bright arc light, as it confused themabout what time of day it was. They were often heard tweeting and chirping atnight when the lights were in use.The key was harnessing incandescent light—dimmable, controllable lighting—thatcould be used indoors and for various purposes. No one had done this yet, thoughmany were desperately trying at the time, and Thomas Edison was determined to bethe first.* * *September 8, 1878Workshop of William Wallace, Ansonia, ConnecticutEdison’s notion—or better put, his obsession—to develop electric light cameabout on another journey with Barker. While on the trip out west, Barker hadasked Edison to visit the workshop of William Wallace and Moses Farmer, whoclaimed they had designed a machine that powered an arc light system that wascalled a dynamo, a generator that converts mechanical energy into electricalenergy. Edison had shown some interest in electric lighting and agreed. Twoweeks after they had returned from their westward trip, Barker and Edisontraveled to Wallace’s shop in Ansonia, Connecticut, also accompanied by CharlesBatchelor and an academic friend of Barker’s by the name of Charles Chandler.A reporter from the New York Sun came along to witness the activity. FromEdison’s first glimpse of the spectacle, the reporter noticed that Edison grewquiet and distanced himself from his companions. As his friends attempted toconverse with him, Edison would laugh or nod but then go back deep inside hishead. And when he saw the Wallace-Farmer dynamo in use, the reporter wrote, “Mr.Edison was enraptured.… Then power was applied … and eight electric lights werekept ablaze at one time, each being equal to 4,000 candles … This filled up Mr.Edison’s cup of joy. He ran from the instrument to the lights, and from thelights back to the instrument. He sprawled over a table with the simplicity of achild, and made all kinds of calculations.”Later, while talking to a reporter from The Sun about the trip, Edison declaredthat he would solve the problem of creating a reliable bulb that was “so simplethat a bootblack [a shoe-shiner] might understand it.” This off-the-cuffstatement was merely Edison making a claim in the moment, but it had turned intoa guarantee by the “Wizard” himself once it hit print form and was read by thepublic.Subdividing the electric light and designing a light bulb wasn’t a novel idea.On the contrary, every inventor and scientist, it seemed, was trying to createthe perfect incandescent bulb. The host of Edison’s visit, William Wallace—alongwith the absent but equal partner, Moses Farmer—were themselves attempting tomake the great discovery. To Edison, this was a chance to one-up every brilliantmind in the world. All these academics and scholars. All these scientists. Noneof them had been able to invent a practical electric light.Upon exiting Wallace’s workshop, Edison was so confident—so competitive—that hedecided to directly address his host. With conviction, Edison said, “Wallace, Ibelieve I can beat you making electric lights. I don’t think you are working inthe right direction.” This wasn’t about money. As Edison himself explained in aninterview, “I don’t care so much about making my fortune, as I do for gettingahead of the other fellows.” Thomas Edison had taken on his most significantcompetition to date. One he was determined to win, at any cost.* * *Less than a week after the trip to Wallace’s workshop, Edison committed to hispromise to deliver by stating he actually had the solution right then and thereand only needed “a few days” to put it in practical usage. Perhaps feelingdoubters’ eyes looking at him from beyond the newspaper, Edison further claimedthe “scientific men” were off in their theories, and he predicted that“everybody will wonder why they have never thought of it, it is so simple.”Edison explained his idea of installing small power stations in Lower Manhattan,connecting stations with businesses and houses with insulated wire that would berun underground. These same wires, he theorized, could power any electricalapparatus. When would this happen? “Soon,” said Edison.Having thrown down the gauntlet in the form of a guarantee to have the electriclight and its effective system in use “soon,” Edison changed his priorities. Nolonger was the phonograph his focus.* * *The first issue was designing a bulb, but not just any bulb. One that wasfunctional, and moreover, one that was cheap and able to be manufactured for themasses with profit in mind.Edison’s team began by experimenting with platinum as the filament. Platinum, asilvery-white metal, seemed like a good choice because it had a high meltingpoint and was malleable enough to be bent and coiled easily. The problem withplatinum filaments was twofold. First, each platinum filament the team triedonly stayed intact for a few minutes because it weakened and broke apart withsustained exposure to heat and oxygen. Even worse, the second problem was thatplatinum was expensive. Far too expensive to mass-produce for the public, evenif it did work for more than five minutes.Edison had made promises, though, and he had a reputation to live up to. Sowhile he and the others worked on finding a functional and inexpensive filamentbehind the scenes, in public Edison offered demonstrations to prove he wasoh-so-close to producing the genuine article.One after another after another after another, Edison entertained reporters fromfour different publications. Each demonstration utilized platinum filaments, andeach time Edison kept the bulb lit for less than four minutes, not risking beingexposed as a fraud. When asked if he’d encountered any problems, Edison deniedcomplications, even suggesting that the unusual ease with how it was initiallyprogressing was the only unnerving thing. After his final demonstration, Edisonplayed the reporter for the press’s full worth, asking the public to remainpatient and maintaining that his invention would be available “in good time.”The positive press resulted in skyrocketing interest and financial backing, andEdison Electric Light Company was formed in November 1878.While Edison continued to entertain the press with stories of how well thingswere going—never divulging specifics—his “few days” turned into a few weeks,which extended into almost a year. Edison even told the New York Times onOctober 21, 1879, that the “electric light is perfected.” It wasn’t, of course.Far from it. But an experiment on that day with carbonized sewing thread hadresulted in forty hours of illumination without burning out. In truth, Edison’swords to the Times were more a celebration of some progress, when in realityEdison Electric had not gained any ground on finding the answer to the practicalincandescent light bulb.The “success” of the forty-hour burn of cotton thread was something to beexcited about. Soon after, though, the cotton filament experienced the sameproblems. It was not the answer. These many failures, these trials and errors,were not a waste of time to Edison, who would later explain that “many of life’sfailures are experienced by people who did not realize how close they were tosuccess when they gave up.” Edison was close.In the middle of November, the team tried carbonized paper that was bent in theshape of a horseshoe. It lit up the glass globe in a soft shimmer of light asthe filament burned.The team waited.It still burned.They waited deep into the night.It continued to burn.For over a day the bulb burned. Edison knew he had found the answer. Carbon. “Ifit will burn for that number of hours now, I know I can make it burn a hundred.”Unlike the bulb experiment, finding the ultimate answer did not happenovernight. Not much ever did in the world of invention. Instead, Edison led histeam on a carbonization quest of every substance they could think of—includingfishing line, cardboard, all kinds of paper, and a host of othermaterials—until, after exhausting over six thousand different options, theydetermined that carbonized bamboo was the best filament for their incandescentbulb.[../images/electricwar_fig6.jpg]Thomas Edison posing with his first incandescent bulbsIt had taken many months of playing the press. Making guarantees and smiling forthe cameras. It had been a long journey full of posturing and putting himself inthe public spotlight, but maybe now he could get back to what he was born to do:invent. He certainly hoped so. For now, Edison had done it. He’d found success:a simple, inexpensive way to harness light and hold it for a sustainedperiod—safely."},{"pageContent":" 5 AC/DC, A CURRENT CRAZE [contents.xhtml#c_ch5]It was a man named Edwin Fox, a reporter for the New York Herald, who broke thenews that Edison had successfully invented and perfected the incandescent lightbulb.Fox, not only a reporter but also Edison’s friend, was given access to Edison’slab in the middle of November 1879. For two weeks the reporter had thisexclusive access, recording the manner in which Menlo Park was being equippedwith some forty bulbs and fixtures. It was a lofty prize Edison had granted toFox, to be privy to the installation of this new invention, shown multipledemonstrations time after time without any competition from any other reporters,and even walked through in elementary fashion the complicated workings andtechnical details of the bulb.The prize had one major condition, though, and that was for Fox to hold offpublishing his article until Edison had given him the go-ahead. Edison and histeam wanted to go through significant tests, run-throughs, and preparationsbefore Fox let the world know, and Fox, being grateful to have the exclusivedish, obliged and claimed he’d hold off until he’d heard from Edison.But like the young Thomas Edison, who couldn’t wait for those goose eggs tohatch, Edwin Fox simply couldn’t put it off any longer. He gave in to hisimpatience when he published “Edison’s Light” in the December 21, 1879, editionof the New York Herald.Fox spared no superlatives in his article, praising the master inventor’s“little globe of sunshine” as a perfect device. No gas or smoke or nasty odor.No blinding light to distract the birds. Nor did Fox spare any opportunity todivulge Edison’s detailed explanation of the technical workings of the bulb. Inthe mode of a how-to manual, Fox laid out the manner in which Edison had figuredout the elusive mystery many had attempted to solve, spelling out the secretsthe Wizard of Menlo Park had shared with him.Understandably, Edison was at first offended by Fox’s betrayal and irritatedthat his friend had brought the article to press before Edison had given it hisblessing. After reading the article again and realizing it was flattering in theextreme as to the inventor’s genius, Edison took it in stride and chalked it upas an inevitable occurrence. He knew drive. Competition. Pride. Edwin Fox wasmuch like him, he decided, and Edison followed up the published article with hisown version of drive, competition, and pride.Instead of backing off and slowing things down, Thomas Edison decided it wastime to go all in. He’d already made promises and guarantees. He’d claimed hehad a bulb that could burn for over one hundred hours and further boasted hecould supply a family with light for twenty-four days straight without issues.How was he to follow up now that Fox had published the details and praised himwith such hyperbole? In typical Thomas Edison fashion, with an even stronger andbolder statement: within ten days, he promised, he would light up ten houses inMenlo Park. But that wasn’t all. He would also—Edison pledged—set up tenelectric streetlamps.His promises and the tight time constraints he’d leveled on his Menlo Park teamwere not readily appreciated by his colleagues. But the Old Man was like this,they knew. Sure, they could try to talk some sense into their boss, as one ofthe company’s main investors, Egisto Fabbri, tried to do by asking Edison tofirst give the lights a test run of a full week before entertaining theten-houses-of-Menlo experiment. Fabbri’s words did very little, though Edisondid agree to a four-hour test run on December 27, 1879, which went off without ahitch.* * *December 28, 1879Menlo Park, New JerseyNo one needed a formal invitation to witness the Menlo Park exhibition. Edison’sblanket announcement didn’t discriminate as to who could show. As a result,people from all fields of occupation and socioeconomic classes made the trip.This was perfectly fine with Edison, who held claim that any- and everyoneshould be able to see the light. After all, his bulb was meant for affordable,practical use by all. What better way to drive that point home than by welcominganyone who was interested?People came.And while some of the initial visitors were unreasonably disappointed that thestreet lampposts were at first not lit up on a real street—and instead weredisplayed in a bare Menlo Park field—the reaction was positive across the board.* * *The next day, more lampposts were lit along the street, satisfying thosehard-to-please early visitors. Within two days, Edison’s promise had beenfulfilled and ten streetlamps were shining brightly, allowing the growing crowdof visitors—which had quickly soared into the hundreds within a couple ofdays—to casually stroll along and stop in the laboratory, or at Sarah Jordan’sboardinghouse next door, which was fully furnished with lights, or at any of theother buildings lit up on the Menlo Park estate.Impressed visitors came and went, all paying witness to the spectacle the greatEdison had promised. The crowds grew as New Year’s Eve neared. What sort oftricks would the Wizard have up his sleeve for the echoing chime of the NewYear?As it turned out, Edison had planned a whole slew of tricks.A laboratory assistant showed off the way an average bulb would be used in thetypical household over a proposed thirty-year span of time, turning it on andoff over and over to simulate the many comings and goings of multiple householdmembers. The light never burned out.A bulb was housed and illuminated underwater in a glass jar, delightingwide-eyed audience members with the shimmering water and shadowy ripples. TheWizard himself was part of the show, just “a simple young man attired in thehomeliest manner, using for his explanations not high sounding technical terms,but the plainest and simplest language,” as the New York Herald described him.On New Year’s Day in 1880, the full weight of Thomas Edison’s popularity presseddown on Menlo Park and on the laboratory itself, which was said to have shownsigns of significant stress and wear with all the traffic and the beyond-maximumcapacity. Inside the lab, light bulbs had been arranged in the shape of aminiature representation of Menlo Park, and this only added to the chaoticpushing and shoving as everyone tried to get a closer look. Hysteria took over,and Edison himself was forced to retreat to his private office in an attempt toquell the commotion his presence caused, like that of a modern-day pop starbeing clamored after by the public. The white flag was waved the next day whenEdison, amid the pleas of his colleagues and business partners, closed MenloPark to the public.Now that Edison had the bulb, he knew it was time to take his invention beyondMenlo Park. Everyone around the world deserved to see the light.One big problem remained: What source of power could be used?They had invented the light bulb. But that didn’t mean anything unless theycould develop a system to run it.* * *The light bulb was a brand-new invention. Sure, it was awe-inspiring and amonumental achievement, but housing light in a glass dome was a totally newconcept. A host of problems came with inventing something that had nopreexisting foundation. If Edison wanted to allow his new bulb to be used byall, that meant he’d have to create everything else to go along with it.One main issue was that there were no outlets, sockets, or fixtures for thisbrilliant contraption. In other words, people wouldn’t have any way to use thebreakthrough device. In modern-day society, if someone gives you a brand-newbulb, you don’t look at it with a quizzical expression, wondering how to make itwork. You realize you have many options. If you’re indoors, you can look aroundand you’ll see a lamp or two, or maybe even five in a room. Or you can find asocket inside or outside any building and simply screw the bulb in, or do alittle walk-through and use it with any of the many fixtures readily available.The humor of the saying “How many [insert subject of joke] does it take to screwin a light bulb?” plays on the ease with which the device can be used. Today,that is. Not in 1880, when Thomas Edison had just created the bulb and put on ashow at Menlo Park.Even worse, it wasn’t only the hardware Edison needed to invent. A whole systemof electricity had to be designed and implemented. Wiring, outlets, and powersources and stations. Everything was yet to be created. This system also had totreat the volatile and mysterious science of electricity with the care andcaution that was necessary to make it safe for the average person. If inventingthe bulb was thought to be difficult, creating a complex and intricate system ofelectricity was about to make the incandescent bulb look like a child’s toy.* * *Direct current was Edison’s first and only love when it came to powering hismagical bulbs. That stubborn boy who often refused to accept opinions contraryto his own saw no other manner in which electricity should be conducted anddistributed, and at the beginning of 1880 Edison submitted his first patentapplication for a “System of Electrical Distribution.”There were problems with direct current, especially in the planning stages, asEdison looked to light up New York City, specifically Lower Manhattan. The mainproblem was that direct current had a short life span in terms of distributionover longer distances (the farther away from the generator/dynamo, the weakerthe electric power), which meant multiple large generators and power plantswould need to be established every half mile to maintain an even powerdistribution throughout the city. This meant rural areas were essentially out ofluck. For these areas, the solution would be smaller site-based power stations.This was not an initial concern, though, and the Menlo Park boys instead focusedon what was needed to power Lower Manhattan, and in the process live up to apromise Edison had made years ago.Worse yet, the elementary dynamos that existed at the time were not efficientenough to power on the scale Edison needed. These existing dynamos could powerthe arc lighting systems employed in 1880, but comparing an arc lighting schemeto that of supplying everybody in a given city with light—and powering otherdevices to come—was laughable. As with sockets and fixtures, here again ThomasEdison knew he’d have to invent something even more important: dynamos that werepowerful and efficient enough to do the job.In addition to the fact that direct current had a short range of distribution,it also required multiple wires. Telegraph and telephone wires already riddledthe area like ugly spiderwebs all over environments like New York City, saggingjust about everywhere, scaring people who were not at all knowledgeable aboutelectricity. To Edison’s credit, he had the foresight to see that adding to theoverhead maze would lead to nothing but problems. For this reason, his plan fromthe very beginning was to bury the wires underground. But this too came withproblems, as workers needed to dig ditches all over the city, and the wiresthemselves had to be insulated.Edison and his team knew they weren’t ready to rush into Lower Manhattan andwork out the glitches—the glitches that came with every invention, not tomention such a grand one as this. To prepare for the full-scale effort andtroubleshoot issues behind the scenes, Menlo Park became a practice field. Wireswere laid out in fields around Menlo to represent roads, with some four to fivehundred streetlights lining them. Wire was buried underground and insulatedexperimentally, which would be an early failure and force the crew to spend moretime to properly insulate the veins of copper spread through the ground.Meanwhile, other hungry businessmen and inventors were trying to push Edisonfrom his spot at the head of the table. In October 1880, Edison heard from hisold friend and reporter Edwin Fox, who had claimed to witness, out the window ofhis Manhattan office, a team of workers in the building across the way busilycreating bulbs much like Edison’s. If this were true, it meant someone else waspushing into Edison’s turf.Edison would later discover that these bulbs were designed by Hiram Maxim andheld a signature M-shaped filament, manufactured and sold by the United StatesElectric Lighting Company. There was no worry in Thomas Edison about someoneessentially using his design, as he knew that was inevitable. What worried himwas that Maxim and United States Electric were beating him to the punch in theNew York City market. This could not happen—Manhattan was his.A determined Thomas Edison looked to start his takeover of Lower Manhattan. Hehadn’t even had a chance to truly explore the details of planning the processbefore running into a significant snag. His system required power stations withlines running underground to neighboring buildings. A lot of lines. To be ableto dig and lay the crucial electrical lines, Edison needed permission from thecorrupt government of New York City, the New York Board of Aldermen. Edison’sidea to win over the aldermen was to throw a massive party that would put hisartificial light on display. After an extravagant party and light show featuringover four hundred lamps at Menlo Park in December 1880—with reportedly moreglasses of champagne being handled than glass bulbs—Edison got his wish, thoughthe price was still substantial in the end. He’d impressed government officialsenough to gain permission to lay the important lines underground where he wantedthem, all through Lower Manhattan.* * *Menlo Park had been the perfect place for Thomas Edison and his team of wiz kidsto stay relatively close to the action of New York City while maintaining enoughseparation to stay focused on work. But almost losing Manhattan to Hiram Maximwas too close a call. It taught Edison something very important. If he wanted tolight up New York City, he needed to be in New York City. Menlo Park might nothave been incredibly far from the hustle and bustle of New York City business,but the light from the New Jersey invention factory wasn’t bright enough toreach the place he promised to light up. As long as he stayed in Menlo Park, thepublic would be in the dark about the promise of Edison’s light.Less than a month after the Menlo Park exhibition for the city representatives,Edison Electric Light Company made the bold move of purchasing a four-storybrownstone at 65 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan for the specific purpose of being aconstant showplace for what Edison Electric had accomplished and what itpromised to soon deliver to all.A gas-powered plant in the basement ran over two hundred Edison bulbs throughoutthe building, letting the place shine like Manhattan’s new North Star, luringpeople to the open-to-all exhibition. The brass of Edison Electric Light knew itwas a genius marketing ploy. But only if it came with an ever-present ThomasEdison. They knew the key was to have their prized showman in their Fifth Avenuebrownstone.Many investors were nervous about proposing to Edison the idea of moving himfrom Menlo Park to the new Manhattan home base, since he had been extremelyvocal about wanting to get back to work and turn away from the needy public eye.Some were certain he’d say—or shout—no. After all, it wouldn’t just mean he’dserve as window dressing, doorman, and glorified tour guide. It also meantturning over operational control of his invention factory to someone else.Yet, to everyone’s surprise, Edison agreed to the move. He was willing to dowhatever best helped Edison Electric Light and his precious bulbs.In January 1881, Edison the inventor once again became Edison the salesman.After a full month of greeting all kinds of visitors—celebrities, scientists,investors, politicians, everyone—Edison brought his family from Menlo Park toManhattan, housing them in a hotel across the street from the Fifth Avenuebrownstone. Within three months, the rest of the workers and equipment followedsuit and moved to New York City.* * *Now that New York City was the official home of Edison Electric Light, the realwork of setting up a system to power Lower Manhattan began in earnest. Theinitial task, finding a place to build the first centralized power plant,supplied a reality check for Edison, who initially planned for a single-floorbuilding around two hundred square feet in size. Early efforts includedsearching in the poorest area, where Edison assumed he could acquire a suitableplot of land and a structure for around ten thousand dollars. Instead, hediscovered that none of the buildings were much more than twenty to thirty feetacross. And even these properties held a price tag much loftier than the fatherof invention had anticipated. In the end, Edison settled on two buildings onPearl Street and paid not $10,000 but an astronomical $155,000. Edison took itin stride. “I was compelled,” he explained, “to change my plan and go upward inthe air where real estate was cheap.” The size limitations forced him toredesign what had called for two hundred square feet by building up instead ofacross. “I cleared out the building entirely to the walls and built my stationof structural ironwork, running it up high.”For the next two years, Edison would expand his business and work on makingPearl Street the power plant it needed to be. His business enterprise grew as hetook on Edison Machine Works—housed in a separate building on the Lower EastSide—to design and manufacture his dynamos, which had to be built completelyfrom scratch to support the power needed. When the Edison Electric board ofdirectors didn’t wish to get involved with manufacturing light bulbs, Edison anda few of his closest colleagues, including Charles Batchelor, created EdisonLamp Company. Indeed, Edison had gone all in with his plans to deliver electriclight to the world.[../images/electricwar_fig7.jpg]Edison Machine WorksAt the same time—less than half a year from the Menlo Park exhibition for thechampagne-infused politicians—upward of four thousand applications for on-site“isolated” plants came rolling in. These consisted of small generating plantsfor the lighting of individual homes, factories, and businesses. Initially,Edison denied these requests and focused solely on his promise to light LowerManhattan. Once he’d accomplished that, he would tend to the rest of New YorkCity. By November 1881, though, Edison had been convinced to allow someapplications to be approved, and the Edison Company for Isolated Lighting wasestablished. Isolated plants were installed and accepted gratefully in variouslocations around the world, totaling over two hundred by May 1882.Back in New York City, the process of lighting and powering Lower Manhattandragged on. By the end of 1881, only a third of the district had been wired. Itwas clear this was going to take time.Finally, on September 4, 1882, at 3:00 p.m.—four grueling years after ThomasEdison had announced his first news about the electric light—a switch wasthrown, amid much pomp and circumstance, and Edison’s bulbs spread light aroundLower Manhattan. As a reward to the first customers, the first four months oflighting were free of charge.For two years the output of Pearl Street, along with the number of customers,slowly grew. But not without issue. All this high-powered machinery and allthese devices were new—literally, they had just been created out of nothing—andproblems developed.To help solve the problems that cropped up, Edison, as he always did, turned tohis trusted team, which had expanded like his business. In 1884, one newemployee would have a brief tenure with Edison Electric but would linger like athorn in Edison’s side for years to come.* * *Nikola Tesla was a Serbian immigrant brand-new to Edison Electric, and he washungry to show his boss what he could do.It didn’t take long for Thomas Edison to notice both Tesla’s eagerness andskill, so to test the new guy, he challenged him to fix the issues with Edison’slighting system aboard the SS Oregon, which was docked in the East River, unableto make its voyage.Tesla worked an all-nighter aboard the Oregon, determined to stay aboard untilhe had met Edison’s challenge.The next morning at five a.m., Tesla saw Edison and Charles Batchelor walkingtoward him on Fifth Avenue. As Tesla recounted the experience: “When I told[Edison] I was coming from the Oregon and had repaired both machines, he lookedat me in silence and walked away without another word. But when he had gone somedistance I heard him remark, ‘Batchellor [sic], this is a good … man.’”[../images/electricwar_fig8_rev_2.jpg]Edison and his original dynamoNikola Tesla had shown up at a time of growth, commotion, and difficulty forEdison Electric. The company was taking on customers, adding buildings andinstitutions, and branching out. This, of course, meant more central stationswere needed, and more power from their dynamos.After Tesla had shown his worth, he waited for the right time to tell his bosshe had a safe way to power many more homes and buildings with far less physicalmaterial expended. Alternating current, Tesla was certain, was the answer. It’sunclear when, exactly, Tesla had this conversation with Edison, as it variesfrom source to source. But gleaned from multiple sources, it’s clear Tesla didat one point hold an audience with Edison, during which he explained the manybenefits of alternating current. These benefits included needing fewer powerstations (one on the outskirts of town as opposed to needing one every half-milewith direct current), using less wire, and having much more power that could bedistributed as seen fit, not just for lights but for any and every otherelectric device.Edison seemed not at all interested, and it’s not clear how much of a chanceTesla had to discuss his scheme with his boss. According to Tesla, Edison wasresolute that he had no intentions of even entertaining the notion of employingalternating current. Tesla explained that Edison claimed “there was no future toit and anyone who dabbled in that field was wasting his time; and besides, itwas a deadly current whereas direct current was safe.”Instead of theorizing over a deadly science like alternating current, Edison hadanother challenge for Tesla. He told him to work on the system they wereusing—direct current—and improve the dynamos and the efficiency of the system.According to Tesla, Edison had “promised me fifty thousand dollars on thecompletion of this task.”Nikola Tesla believed strongly in alternating current, but he also loved achallenge. Fifty thousand dollars was nice, too, so he committed himself thesame way he had aboard the Oregon and “designed twenty-four different types ofstandard machines with short cores and of uniform pattern which replaced the oldones.” After several months, he had done it. Tesla had essentially tripled theoutput of a system he didn’t even believe was as efficient as the one he haddesigned, and he’d done so for his boss. It was time to collect on the promiseEdison had made.Upon completion of his work, Tesla approached Edison and detailed the work he’ddone. Then he inquired about the fifty thousand dollars Edison had promised.Edison shook his head. “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor. When youbecome a full-fledged American, you will appreciate an American joke.”Edison was right: Tesla didn’t understand the humor in this supposed joke, andhe didn’t understand this man’s method of doing business, either. Moreover, healso didn’t understand why this man was foolish enough to stick with a system ofcurrent that was clearly inferior to his.Tesla had had it. He’d learned a tough lesson about business, about trust, andabout Edison. “This gave me a painful shock and I resigned my position.” With nomonetary gain realized for his hard work and ingenuity, Tesla’s short tenurewith Thomas Edison was over less than a year after it had started.Just like he had been a year prior when he’d first arrived in America, NikolaTesla was on his own. Yet in truth, this wasn’t unusual for him. He’d learnedearly in life that being alone is the price often paid for being unique.And this man—Nikola Tesla—was nothing if not unique."},{"pageContent":" 6 FLASHES OF LIGHT [contents.xhtml#c_ch6]Although his birth certificate lists July 10, 1856, as the day Nikola Tesla wasintroduced to the world, the man himself vehemently claimed he was born on thevery moment of transference from one day to the next, at the “stroke ofmidnight” where July 9 and July 10 intersect.True, July 10 has been noted as Nikola Tesla’s birthday ever since, but it wouldonly be fitting if Tesla actually was born at the exact moment where two dayschanged hands. After all, where does one place a man born in between two days?Should the recorded date of birth list two dates? Or does this defy what abirthday actually is? If it were to be decided—by the people who decide suchthings—that this rare occurrence necessitated two dates to be listed, would theman then have two birthdays and not one? And further, if two dates were to belisted, how could it be explained to people in later times that a man had beenborn on two different days? These questions and their perplexing, cyclicalnature mirror the man who claimed to own the rare birthday. Nikola Tesla simplydidn’t fit within the world’s defined parameters, beginning from his earliestmoment of existence.Tesla’s birth wasn’t just odd in terms of the hands’ position on the clock, butin terms of the weather as well, as a raging electrical storm had manifestedover Tesla’s family home, located in what is now Smiljan, Croatia. The tempestrained down crackling shafts of light and meteoric drops of water in equalmeasure. The family’s midwife, noticing the omen of the boy’s birth at midnight,made the assertion that Tesla was a “child of the storm,” meaning he’d be acursed child “of darkness.” Nikola’s mother, Djuka Mandic, quickly correctedher. “No,” she said flatly. “He will be a child of the light.” She had no way ofknowing how accurate that premonition would become.Nikola’s mother was a descendant of one of the oldest and most traditionalSerbian families, a “line of inventors” who had “originated numerous implementsfor household, agricultural and other uses.” Tesla—called “Niko” as a youngboy—recognized from an early age that his mother “worked indefatigably, frombreak of day till late at night,” and she was “an inventor of the first order,”who “invented and constructed all kinds of tools and devices and wove the finestdesigns from thread which was spun by her.”Young Niko’s childhood involved creating devices useful to him at the time.Contraptions like a cornstalk popgun and fishing hooks for catching frogsoffered him some entertainment in his early years. A rather clever inventionNiko developed as a boy was the four-bladed wooden propeller to whose blades heattached, by way of adhesive or threaded restraints, three or four May-bugseach. These rather bulky, powerful-but-clumsy flying bugs “were remarkablyefficient,” according to Tesla, and he noted that “once they were started theyhad no sense to stop and continued whirling for hours and hours.” It was asource of much amusement for young Niko, until a neighborhood boy decided to putan end to the whirling dervish by eating the bugs. The hideous sight “terminatedmy endeavors in this promising field and I have never since been able to touch aMay-bug or any other insect for that matter.”While Nikola’s mother supplied him with an inventive and hardworking example,his father, Milutin Tesla, was an Orthodox priest. But Niko didn’t gain a strongsense of faith from his father, as the boy never could devote himself to thespiritual calling he was supposed to follow. Instead, Niko gained other trainingfrom his father, who was also a writer. “The training he gave me,” an adultNikola would later comment, “must have been helpful. It comprised all sorts ofexercises—as, guessing one another’s thoughts, discovering the defects of someform or expression, repeating long sentences or performing mental calculations.These daily lessons were intended to strengthen memory and reason and especiallyto develop the critical sense.” Milutin was not without his peculiar featuresand mannerisms. The man was prone to talking to himself, often using differenttones and accents, which an adult Nikola Tesla would also do later in his ownlife.In the time period in which Nikola was born, boys in his country had two optionsfrom which to choose as a future: one was the army, and the other was theclergy. Naturally, Nikola was expected to follow his father’s lead. Niko didn’tcare for either option but felt compelled to hold the path his father had blazedfor him, especially given the fact that the family had experienced tragedy withthe loss of Niko’s big brother, Dane, who an older Nikola described as “giftedto an extraordinary degree.” Dane’s death, an accident with the family horse,had left his parents “disconsolate.” After Dane’s death, Niko felt that anythinghe did “that was creditable merely caused my parents to feel their loss morekeenly.” Certainly, he felt the added pressure that he should continue thefamily legacy and join the clergy.Niko experienced what some have referred to as “hallucinations” and others as“visions” and still others would claim were “out-of-body experiences.” As Teslahimself described, “I suffered from a peculiar affliction due to the appearanceof images, often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which marred the sightof real objects and interfered with my thought and action.” He’d go on toexplain that these images were of things he had actually seen, not imaginedapparitions, though it became difficult at times to decipher what was real andwhat was not. To help heal himself, Tesla turned to the power of the mind, fullyfocusing his train of thought on something else. This often worked, but itwasn’t as effective once he’d exhausted the images he had actually seen.Imagination then intervened and morphed with reality, forcing his mind to focuseven harder. In time, his mind would take him on “journeys—see new places,cities and countries—live there, meet people and make friendships andacquaintances and, however unbelievable, it is a fact that they were just asdear to me as those in actual life.”Niko’s time attending Real Gymnasium—middle school to those in America—washindered by these flashes, though the boy showed early signs of a brilliantmind. Niko read every book he could find about electricity and “experimentedwith batteries and induction coils.” Indeed, Niko’s intellect was advanced,further evidenced by the fact that calculus, often seen as a labyrinth to moststudents, was so simple for Niko that his teachers accused him of cheating.Social settings and relationships of all kinds were not as simplistic ascalculus, and certainly not as appealing as learning about electricity. Niko’slabyrinth was dealing with his peers, which is why he often preferred thecompany of birds and other animals over people.One experience that perfectly captures Niko’s lack of social tact involved twoof his old aunts—both unattractive to the extreme, according to Tesla. Aftergoing back and forth about their appearance, the two aunts asked Niko to settlethe argument and tell them who the more attractive aunt was. As Tesla explained,“After examining their faces intently, I answered thoughtfully, pointing to oneof them, ‘This here is not as ugly as the other.’”Naturally, childhood was difficult for a boy who suffered from “flashes oflight” and social anxiety. He “had many strange likes, dislikes and habits.” Oneitem he held an extreme disdain for was earrings, especially pearls, which wouldput him into hysterics on sight. Touching another person’s hair caused Nikola toconvulse and shake as well. And peaches—nothing disgusted him more than thespherical, fuzzy fruit. Yet shiny objects, like diamonds or crystals, pleasedhim very much, as did objects with “sharp edges and plane surfaces.” Birdsfascinated Niko, to the point where he’d spend hours playing with the localbirds on the farm like he was playing with a group of friends. Niko also had tohave everything arranged in neat, logical order and sequence, and it wasimperative that routines be repeated in exact replication each time. Apsychiatrist today might classify this as obsessive-compulsive disorder, but inTesla’s time he was just labeled “odd,” the same label he’d earned due to hisvisions.Much later in his adolescence, when he was seventeen, these flashes becameproductive. In his mind, seemingly before his eyes, he gained visions of hisinventions. A device and its workings would manifest in great detail, making itso the physical creation was all that was left. No theory or tinkering wasneeded. His mind—these visions—had shown him what to do. “When I get an idea,”Tesla offered, “I start at once building it up in my imagination. I change theconstruction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind.… In this wayI am able to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touchinganything.”During his early teen years, one of Tesla’s most detailed visions was of a placehe had seen in the books at school: a place called Niagara Falls. These falls,beautifully depicted in illustrations and drawings, along with detailed textdescriptions, were a miraculous natural phenomenon to Tesla. As he saw the fallsmore and more and let the images capture his mind, a flashing vision came tohim, one that involved a giant wheel being turned continually by the powerful,roaring waves. Later, he vowed to his uncle that one day he would travel toAmerica and see this scheme realized. This vision of Niagara remained in hisconsciousness—with as much detail as the day it had appeared—for the rest of hislife, calling him toward it on an almost daily basis.Nikola’s late teen years resulted in vices, including smoking and gambling. ToNikola’s father, a man of little vice and plenty of virtue, this wasunacceptable. But to his mother, a woman who had come to understand the natureof man—having surrounded herself with stubborn, willful men earlier in life—itwas merely a matter of experimenting, learning, and changing. To this end, sheonce gave her son a lofty sum of money and told him to go and spend it all.Nikola did just that, and blew through the lot so quickly that he felt guiltand, according to Tesla, “only regretted that [my addiction] had not been ahundred times as strong. I not only vanquished but tore it from my heart so asnot to leave even a trace of desire.” Tesla applied his strong mind to fixinghis smoking habit and his predilection for drinking too much coffee, and inessence willed his vices away for good.[../images/electricwar_fig12.jpg]The charismatic and enigmatic Nikola TeslaAt the age of seventeen, Nikola was set to join the clergy, but not of his ownaccord. His father, and everyone around him, didn’t entertain any other choicefor a future. Then fate intervened in the form of a severe case of cholera,which held Nikola at death’s door. In bed and seemingly ready to die, he saidsomething to his father, musing that if he would be promised the chance to go toschool and study electricity, then perhaps he would get better. Upon hisfather’s vow, Tesla miraculously recovered.Nikola Tesla’s higher education began in 1877 at the age of twenty-one. Heattended Realschule, Karlstadt in Germany, where he dove headfirst—mindfirst—into the study of electricity. It fascinated Tesla. Everything about it.Now as a young adult with ample education and a developed mind, these flashes oflight turned into flashes of brilliance, both in the form of light and the formof grand schemes. His professors, though, were not appreciative of Tesla’sconstant challenging of the curriculum. While they talked about thefunctionality of direct current and its safe and productive nature, Tesla arguedthat it was an incredible waste of energy. He believed it to be a system ofelectricity that would only hit dead ends. To Tesla, alternating current was theanswer, one that had no dead ends and only kept going due to its logicalscientific principles.In 1880, Tesla finished his studies by attending lectures at the University ofPrague, but he never graduated with a degree. Tesla then transitioned from theclassroom to the workplace, taking a position at the Central Telegraph Office inBudapest in January 1881. While in Budapest, alternating current dominated hisevery thought, and time working on his alternating current motor consumed him.This predisposition to light and electricity can be traced back to two relatedboyhood experiences, both of which included Niko’s favorite childhood companion,the family cat, Macak.One dry winter day, Niko brushed his hand along Macak’s back. “I saw a miraclethat made me speechless with amazement. Macak’s back was a sheet of light and myhand produced a shower of sparks loud enough to be heard all over the house.”These sparks were the beginning, the heat to start a lifelong blaze in Tesla’smind. The other experience, not long after the first, happened when Macaksauntered across a cold, dark room in the candlelight. Tesla’s memory held thatimage for many years. “[Macak] shook his paws as though he were treading on wetground. I looked at him attentively … surrounded by a halo like … a saint!”These two experiences together kept Nikola Tesla asking every day, “What iselectricity?”When Tesla was twenty-six, a different experience would mix with the twochildhood memories with the family cat and serve as a compass to guide the restof his life. It happened in Budapest, during a walk with his college friendAnthony Szigeti, when a severe vision came to him, one that held great claritylike no previous flash of light. Tesla observed a host of circular objectsaround him and the vision grew more finite and tangible. His vision was a roundobject full of energy, reminiscent of the sun. Fixed in four differentspots—like the twelve, three, six, and nine on a clock—hard coil wrapped aroundthe edges of the circle. This round orb of energy spun from one station of coilto the next, as if one coil was activating and then deactivating, and then thenext, and then next, until the circle was continually pulled around and aroundwithout any noticeable end. It was a vision that would change not just more ofTesla’s thoughts but also the history of humankind. Tesla had just “seen” hisalternating current motor at work. He had invented an alternating currentinduction motor.[../images/electricwar_fig10.jpg]Schematic of Tesla’s alternating current motorOf course, now that he’d invented it in his mind, he had to physically constructthe motor. So from 1880 to 1884, Nikola Tesla worked on his motor, trying tomake it function just as it had when he’d envisioned it. During this time, hedesperately tried to get backing to produce his motor in Germany and in France,but he never came close to success in gaining investors.Then, in 1884, while Edison Electric Light was installing a direct currentsystem in Paris, Nikola Tesla came across a man named Charles Batchelor, whojust so happened to be Thomas Edison’s trusty right-hand man. Batchelor wasrunning the Edison plant in Paris while Edison himself was getting things inorder back in New York. Tesla’s work attracted Batchelor, who soon offered towrite a letter for the Serbian inventor. Later, Edison would mistakenly refer toTesla as the “Parisian” because Batchelor had told him they’d met in Paris.Tesla knew that if anyone could help him develop and produce his alternatingcurrent motor, it was the father of invention, Thomas Edison. This was NikolaTesla’s big break.A long journey was in store for the twenty-eight-year-old Tesla. The eagerinventor boarded a ship and took off on an arduous seafaring adventure. Withonly four cents in his pocket, he touched American soil in New York City on June6, 1884, with a recommendation letter in hand from Charles Batchelor addressedto Thomas Edison. Tesla opened the letter again. Like he had many times aboardthe ship, he ran his eyes over the part that made him certain this was meant tobe. “I know two great men and you are one of them,” Batchelor had written toEdison. “The other is this young man.”Tesla hurried off to find his destination, a place on Fifth Avenue, where thegreat Thomas Edison was said to be. As he walked, Tesla’s flashes of lightspread before him, all filled with this great man, the one and only ThomasEdison, falling in love with his alternating current motor."},{"pageContent":" 7 WHAT’S MINE IS YOURS [contents.xhtml#c_ch7]After leaving Edison Electric, Nikola Tesla might have been alone and exposed tothe harsh conditions of unemployment—broke and in need of direction—but theSerbian immigrant had learned some valuable lessons during his time underEdison’s umbrella.First, Tesla learned that his competition, even the vaunted Thomas Edison, wasnot without vulnerability. The fact that he could improve Edison’s productionand machinery showed Tesla he was a step above his competitors when it came tointelligence. Further, the manner in which Edison shunned all discussion ofalternating current told Tesla that the master inventor was nervous—afraidsomeone would come along and best his prized direct current approach. Tesla wascertain that his design was more advanced and more practical than directcurrent.The problem, Tesla had discovered, was the fact that this man was “the” ThomasEdison. He’d proven himself. “I was amazed at this wonderful man who, withoutearly advantages and scientific training, had accomplished so much,” Teslaconcluded. In contrast to the Serb’s extensive education, Edison had scantformal training, yet he was still as bright as the bulbs he’d invented. Edisonwasn’t just smart in innovation; the man known as the father of invention waswise when it came to knowing how the world worked. How business worked. Howpeople worked.Even with newfound confidence that he was up to the challenge, Tesla foundhimself without many scientific or business contacts. And more important, helacked financial backers. But in March 1885, Lemuel Serrell—a former agent ofThomas Edison’s—along with patent artist Raphael Netter, stepped in and gaveTesla the guidance he needed.Serrell understood the extent of Tesla’s brilliant mind, and he took the time tobreak down the business side of the invention process, allowing Tesla tounderstand the important concept of making fragmented improvements to alreadyestablished inventions, in order to prove his skill set. In return, Tesla paidSerrell and Netter for their services.But working on another person’s invention was relatively foreign to Tesla, as hehad always spent his time creating extravagant inventions in his head, likebuilding unique worlds piece by piece with his imagination until everything wasfunctional in his mind. He had never considered looking at the flaws of existinginventions and modifying them with an eye on patenting the improvements. It tookSerrell’s insight and tutelage to show Tesla that there was money to be made byimproving existing inventions. And more important for the unproven immigrant,patenting these improvements would help him build a name for himself.On March 30, 1885, Serrell and Netter helped Tesla patent his first improvementof an existing device by eliminating the flickering that often made arc lights acrackling nuisance. Not long after, in May and June of that year, two morepatents were issued, including an improvement to the dynamo commutator toprevent sparking. In July, a fourth patent was added to his collection, makingfour patents in a mere four months.This work did exactly what Tesla had hoped; it helped him gain businesscontacts, two of whom would soon become both a blessing and a curse. During hismeetings with Serrell and Netter, Nikola Tesla met Robert Lane and B. A. Vail,two New Jersey businessmen who saw potential in the young inventor. To Lane andVail, Tesla was a magnificent pearl that had been hidden from view; here was aman who had proven he could make technology more practical, and no one had yetcracked the shell to see the brilliance inside. Now that Lane and Vail haddiscovered Tesla, they were determined to cash in on their find.Tesla’s mind was in perpetual motion, inventions constantly assemblingthemselves in his overactive brain, and these two men were there to supply thecapital that would allow these visions to be brought to life. In exchange fortheir capital investment, Lane and Vail would hold control of the patents andthe company itself. Impulsively, Tesla agreed to partner with these twobusinessmen, and Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing was established inVail’s hometown of Rahway, New Jersey. But before they got to Tesla’salternating current system, Lane and Vail made Tesla promise to commit himselfto the Rahway project.With vague assurances that the company would soon begin work on Tesla’salternating current system, Tesla began working on a solitary project for thegood part of a year’s time: designing, developing, and implementing the firstand only municipal arc lighting system in the town and factories of Rahway.Although his alternating current visions would continue to dominate his mind,Tesla went at the Rahway arc lighting project with tenacity, drawing theattention of George Worthington, the editor of the renowned Electrical Reviewjournal, who featured Tesla’s system on the front page of the August 14, 1886,issue.In turn, over the following months Tesla and his partners advertised thecompany’s work in the publication, hiring a mechanical artist from New York Cityto draw the lamp and dynamo, while Tesla wrote copy that claimed theirs was “themost perfect” and “entirely new” arc lighting system. The company, and moreimportant, the Tesla name, was getting noticed.Unfortunately, after the work on the Rahway project had been exhausted and Teslabroached the subject of working on alternating current—as his partners hadpromised—it became clear that Vail and Lane had no desire to invest in what theyhad determined was a “useless” invention like AC. Tesla was outraged, havingdoubled his efforts with the Rahway project for the sole purpose of expeditingthe process and getting to work on his AC plans sooner.To Vail and Lane, though, the company had done all they had envisioned, and theydealt Tesla the “hardest blow I ever received” when they forced him out of hisown company with “no other possession than a beautifully engraved certificate ofstock of hypothetical value.” Like Edison had done to him more than a yearearlier, Vail and Lane had duped Tesla out of any material gain for his hardwork.* * *The winter of 1886–87 found Tesla taking various service jobs repairingelectrical equipment, followed by a period of digging ditches for WesternUnion’s underground cables. While his extensive education and training went towaste, Tesla endured what he would call his season of “terrible headaches andbitter tears, my suffering being intensified by my material want.”Despite this difficult time in his life, Tesla did manage to file a patent for anew kind of motor that utilized the relationship between heat—and the lack ofit—to produce and remove a magnetic force. This notion had been inspired bysomething Tesla had learned during his disappointing tenure under Thomas Edison.It had become known internally at Edison Electric that an 1884 experiment usingcoal to heat and power electricity had resulted in the coal overheating andeventually culminated with the production of a gas that ignited and caused anexplosion so powerful it blew out the windows of the laboratory. Tesla, uponhearing the many tellings and retellings of the story, got lost in the scienceof the accident. He knew that heat forced a loss of magnetic attraction, andconversely when cooled reintroduced the magnetic force, only to be lost againwhen back in contact with heat. If, he determined, this cyclical pattern couldbe harnessed and maintained, it could cause a continuance of movement, with theend result being a rather effective motor. Thus, his thermomagnetic motor wascontrived and then patented, all while he toiled in the ditches he was diggingfor Western Union. It was reminiscent of his miraculous birth during a violentstorm; some good always seemed to come with the bad for Tesla. Such would be thecase with his ditch-digging work.Tesla had explained his thermomagnetic motor to the foreman of his crew, who inturn notified the superintendent of Western Union, Alfred S. Brown, about theinvention. Brown, who had previously read about Tesla in the Electrical Reviewfeature, decided he needed to meet with this genius scientist who was wastinghis brilliance digging ditches.Brown knew the limitations of direct current, and he swiftly contacted hisfriend Charles F. Peck, a distinguished lawyer, to see if he wanted to partnerwith Tesla. Peck had vast knowledge of patents along with ample business sense,and he also had a good deal of capital to offer. The problem, Tesla learned, wasthat Peck believed alternating current to be a waste of time, so much so that hedeclined Tesla’s invitation to witness his AC tests and demonstrations. Teslaneeded to win this man over, and he needed to do it with flair.“Do you remember the ‘Egg of Columbus’?” Tesla asked Peck when he’d finallygained an audience with him.Peck nodded, acknowledging that he knew of the myth.Christopher Columbus, as the story goes, had also met with disbelievers abouthis theories and his desire to explore the far reaches of the sea. As achallenge, Columbus allegedly asked his doubters to balance a hard-boiled egg onits end, which of course led to many failed attempts and frustrations. Columbusthen offered a wager: If he could balance an egg on its end, would they granthim an audience with Queen Isabella? They laughed and agreed, certain that ifthey couldn’t do it, there was no way this man would be able to. Columbus, withno hesitation, struck a gentle blow on the end of an egg and cracked its shell,and with little effort placed the egg on its end. He had balanced the egg justas he’d claimed he would. His disbelievers were impressed with the man’s freshway of thinking and ingenuity, and soon after Columbus had his meeting withQueen Isabella. The rest, of course, is history, as Columbus was given the shipsand funding for his journey to the Indies.Noticing Peck was not amused or intrigued by his allusion, Tesla quickly addedthat he’d do it “without cracking the shell.” Peck’s eyes glimmered, so Teslawent in for the kill. “If I should do this, would you admit that I had goneColumbus one better?”When Peck agreed that doing so would impress him enough to gain his support,Tesla dashed away and secured a hard-boiled egg. He headed to a localblacksmith, who fashioned a copper plating for the egg, several brass balls, andpivoted iron discs. Next, Tesla constructed a circular wooden enclosure withpolyphase circuits along the perimeter and headed back to see Peck and show himhow he could go “one better” than Christopher Columbus.With confidence, Tesla placed the egg in the center of the enclosure and turnedon the current. The egg spun, at first with an awkward wobble. Then the speedpicked up and the egg righted itself and spun on its end. Tesla looked at Peckand grinned. He had balanced the egg on its end … without cracking the shell.Even better, he had also demonstrated the fundamental principles of alternatingcurrent with this rotation of a magnetic field.[../images/electricwar_fig11.jpg]Reproduction of Tesla’s “Egg of Columbus” displayHandshakes were exchanged, and Tesla, Brown, and Peck formed Tesla ElectricCompany. They agreed to split the patents fifty-fifty, and then structured theirdeal so profits and resources were split with a third going to Tesla, a third toBrown and Peck, and the remaining third being invested in future inventions.This last component helped to calm Tesla’s apprehension about going intobusiness with others, especially after his horrible experiences with Edison,Vail, and Lane. An additional salary of two hundred and fifty dollars per monthfurther assured Tesla that Brown and Peck were investing in a long-term futurewith him—one that would focus on his obsession: alternating current.* * *In April 1887, Tesla Electric Company opened for business in the upper level ofa building at 89 Liberty Street in New York City, which was adjacent to what istoday the World Trade Center. The lab was scant, with merely a workbench, stove,and a Weston dynamo as furnishings.[../images/electricwar_fig9b.jpg]Nikola TeslaOn the lower level, Globe Stationery & Printing Company ran a steam engineduring the daytime, a fact that benefited Tesla. Brown and Peck took advantageof this by utilizing the steam engine for power at night, converting Tesla—likehis rival Thomas Edison—into a night-owl worker, a habit that would extendthroughout the rest of his life.Brown and Peck had complete confidence in Tesla’s alternating current system,and Tesla was able to quell his paranoia and distrust for business partners asthe relationship proved to be one of mutual respect and trust. Because of this,Tesla agreed to work on other inventions while developing alternating current.With Peck handling most of the patent business and supplying the bulk of thecapital and Brown serving as a technical expert, the three partners became sucha good team that it took less than a year for Tesla to design three completesystems of AC machinery (single-, two-, and three-phase currents), producedynamos for all three phases, construct motors for producing power from thedynamos, and put together transformers for automatic control of the machinery.Tesla calculated the complex math behind his inventions, allowing Peck to filedetailed patents.Tesla Electric Company was well on its way, and the name Nikola Tesla was slowlystarting to cross the lips of more people in the fields of science and business.Still, something was missing. Tesla needed a way to broadcast his name on agrand scale."},{"pageContent":" 8 MEETING OF THE MINDS [contents.xhtml#c_ch8]You could argue that without legendary producer Berry Gordy, pop star MichaelJackson would never have become the “King of Pop.” Gordy saw genius in youngMichael, and it was through his guidance that Michael exploded onto the musicscene. Further, those who witnessed the relationship between Howard Cosell andMuhammad Ali would agree that without Cosell the world would not have known Alion the grand scale on which he dominated the American media. True, Ali, who wasborn as Cassius Clay, would have had a boxing career without Cosell’s presence,but it was by way of the reporter’s continual coverage that everyone came tolove and respect the boxer who floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee.Likewise, in the scientific world it can be said that without Thomas CommerfordMartin, there wouldn’t have been a Nikola Tesla, and perhaps no alternatingcurrent. For without the man known as “T.C.” to most, it’s doubtful Nikola Teslawould have grown in reputation and notoriety as he did.T. C. Martin—a man of distinguished physical features: a shaved head, piercingeyes, and a gaudy mustache—was a professional writer who had worked for ThomasEdison from 1877 to 1879. In search of a change in scenery, he left on goodterms with Edison and settled in Jamaica for a short time before returning toNew York in 1883 as editor of the moderately successful scientific journalOperator and Electric World. Using his relationship with Edison, T.C. broughtthe publication into the spotlight by featuring the father of invention on aregular basis. Before long, T.C.’s name became known and well respected inscientific circles—seen as an affable visionary with a natural intuition formarketing and social promotion—but he wanted more out of his job, leading him toorganize an internal coup at Operator and Electric World. With coeditor JosephWetzler by his side, they left for Electrical Engineer, which soon became themost respected publication in the field due to T.C.’s reputation and the qualityof work he helped produce. In 1887, T.C. was named president of the newly formedAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), an organization that wouldadvance his career, and later Nikola Tesla’s.[../images/Tesla_inductionmotor_option2.jpg]Model of Tesla’s AC induction motorIn July 1887, T.C. learned about Tesla and his alternating current experiments.Intrigued, he set up a visit to his Liberty Street laboratory.Immediately impressed by Tesla’s brilliant ideas and his confident demeanor,T.C. talked Tesla into being featured in the publication. T.C. commented thatTesla had “eyes that recall all the stories one has read of keenness of visionand phenomenal ability to see through things. He is an omnivorous reader, whonever forgets … A more congenial companion cannot be desired.”An important relationship had been formed, one that would last for decades andresult in mutual gains on both sides and also produce the most importantcompilation of Tesla’s writings in 1893, edited by T.C., aptly titled TheInventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla.In 1888, though, the problem was that Tesla’s name was not known like Edison’s,and Tesla didn’t have the desire to self-promote nor the skills to do so. Thiswas, remember, the boy who had once tried to compliment one aunt by explainingthat she was not as ugly as the other. In Tesla’s own mind, he was an immigrantwho still had much to learn about the American way of life. He needed to find away to get his name out there, and T. C. Martin was the perfect man to help himdo this.At the beginning of the year, T.C. arranged for former Cornell Universityengineering professor and esteemed scientist William Anthony to test Tesla’s ACmotors for efficiency. T.C. realized Tesla needed a respected person in thefield to vouch for his work, and he believed Anthony, who had recently accepteda new position at Mather Electric Company in Connecticut, was the person theyneeded to stand behind Tesla’s AC invention.[../images/electricwar_fig14_rev.jpg]William AnthonyWith his unkempt beard catching the eye of all who met him, misleading some tobelieve he was more of a lumberjack than an academic, Anthony came to theLiberty Street lab upon T.C.’s request. Anthony’s tests continually yieldedgreat results. In turn, Tesla agreed to visit Cornell to display his motors toprofessors and students. After thorough tests had concluded, Anthony was certainTesla had something special with his alternating current system. T.C. andAnthony urged Tesla to present at an upcoming AIEE convention, one that wouldhold attendance of some of the most brilliant—and most important—scientificminds in the world.Tesla shuddered at the idea of presenting in front of a large group of experts.It wasn’t a lack of knowledge that worried him; it was the large audience thatbothered him. If Tesla had had his wish, he would have been perfectly contenthiding himself in his laboratory away from as many people as possible.Adding to Tesla’s unwillingness to give the lecture was the fact that althoughhe had gotten over most of his apprehension that had resulted from the betrayalof Edison, Vail, and Lane, he still harbored some paranoia when it came tosharing his work publicly. As T.C. explained, Tesla was unwilling “to give theInstitute any paper at all” on his work, so much so that he was not convinced byT.C. and Anthony to give the lecture until the day before the convention.Hastily, Tesla relented and wrote out everything in pencil on the eve of thepresentation.* * *May 15, 1888American Institute of Electrical Engineers Convention,Columbia College, New York, New York“I now have the pleasure of bringing to your notice a novel system of electricdistribution and transmission of power by means of alternate currents,” saidTesla, with his eyes fixed on his audience. He had just started his lecture,which he had titled “A New System of Alternate Current Motors and Transformers,”and he was poised and confident. His opening statements concluded with theassertion that his system would “establish the superior adaptability of thesecurrents to the transmission of power.”T. C. Martin was impressed with Tesla’s newfound authoritative presence, and heknew it was especially difficult because the majority of the electricians andengineers in attendance were opposed to alternating current. At the time of thelecture, Thomas Edison had already launched his campaign to promote DC and atthe same time publicly scorn the effectiveness and safety of AC. There had beena few champions of AC—including the forerunner in the AC market, GeorgeWestinghouse—and the War of the Currents had already begun. The players in thewar, though, had yet to fully surface.Now here came Tesla Electric Company, which held the fundamental patents forTesla’s functional system, and people were watching with a skeptical eye. Afterall, only weeks earlier Thomas Edison had commented about George Westinghouse,saying, “Just as certain as death Westinghouse will kill a customer within sixmonths after he puts in a system of any size … It will never be free fromdanger.”With the odds stacked against him, Tesla used diagrams, mathematicalcalculations, and carefully selected words to describe the oft-publicizedproblems with AC, which he followed with detailed, clearly stated solutions. Ashe presented his visuals and calculations, the engineers in attendance nodded inagreement, in shock that they had not thought of the very concepts Tesla wassharing with them. With his audience captivated, Tesla transitioned to ademonstration that showed how synchronous motors could be reversed in aninstant. “A characteristic feature of motors of this kind is their capacity ofbeing very rapidly reversed.”He also detailed his data on single-, two-, and three-phrase motors and evenexplained how they could easily be adapted with a DC apparatus. Never before hadanyone displayed the manner in which AC could be used with DC machinery.T. C. Martin looked on with pride. The sight of Tesla owning the stage was likeseeing a masterful work of art that had once been a blank canvas. Without T.C.’sskilled use of his palette, this exhibition would not have been possible. Teslacontinued while the attendees murmured excitedly—fully engaged.[../images/electricwar_fig15.jpg]Drawing showing the function of Tesla’s high-frequency single-wire lighting[../images/electricwar_fig16.jpg]Tesla’s AC induction motor patent sketchAfter Tesla completed his lecture, William Anthony added support by claimingthat his independent tests had shown Tesla’s polyphase motors worked at slightlymore than 60 percent efficiency. Anthony also noted that the direction of thecurrent could be reversed “so quickly that it was almost impossible to tell whenchange took place.” This ability to reverse the current swiftly was the key tosustained electric service without interruption and allowed AC to maintain thestrength and output of the electricity. This was a complete contrast to DC,where the current fed in one direction from one circuit to the next, weakeningthe output the farther away from the power source you got.By the conclusion of the lecture, Tesla had detailed his entire system withperfect clarity, spoken with authority, commanded the respect of the audience,and had an esteemed expert validate his claims. Nikola Tesla had had himself avery good day and confirmed his professional status.* * *Tesla’s fame soared immediately following the lecture. Among the most interestedand enthusiastic attendees was a group of engineers who worked for GeorgeWestinghouse. Their boss had already been entertaining the idea of purchasingTesla’s patents, but when his engineers came back from the AIEE conference inawe of what they’d just witnessed, Westinghouse began negotiations in earnestwith Brown and Peck.Only six days after the lecture, Westinghouse sent his vice president HenryByllesby to the Liberty Street lab, along with his lawyer Mr. Kerr. AlthoughByllesby admitted the science was beyond his intellectual grasp, he concludedthat Tesla was a “straight-forward, enthusiastic” man. Fully impressed but atthe same time conscious of business tactics, Byllesby and Kerr kept the meetingshort to feign disinterest. As Byllesby and Kerr shook hands with Brown andPeck, the two Tesla Electric Company partners explained that they needed adecision by that Friday because there was an eager businessman in San Franciscothey were negotiating with.Westinghouse trusted Byllesby and Kerr, but he did not fall for the bluff of themysterious San Francisco contact. Instead, he spent the next six weeks checkingthe validity of Tesla’s work, sending different Westinghouse Electricrepresentatives to test Tesla’s machinery. Finally, at the constant urging ofThomas Kerr, Westinghouse concluded, “If the Tesla patents are broad enough tocontrol the alternating motor business, then Westinghouse Electric Companycannot afford to have others own the patents.”The terms of the sale vary from source to source, with some claimingWestinghouse paid an even one million dollars for the patents, some claiming hepaid one hundred thousand, while still others claiming he spent just over twohundred thousand. Regardless, all experts agree that Westinghouse spent asubstantial sum of money for the outright possession of the forty patents, andit is unanimously confirmed that Tesla was supposed to receive royalties of$2.50 per watt produced from his motors.And yet, even with the business matter settled and Tesla’s patents in the handsof Westinghouse, these two great men had not even met in person. To rectifythat, Tesla was invited to Westinghouse’s Pittsburgh laboratory, where he agreedto stay for an indefinite amount of time to help develop and effectively launchthe AC system.Tesla was in the middle of the happiest and most gratifying period of his life.The visions he’d seen in his mind throughout his childhood were now coming tolife before his eyes. Nikola Tesla was a proud parent, alternating current histreasured child.[../images/electricwar_fig9b_rev.jpg]Nikola Tesla[../images/electricwar_fig18.jpg]George WestinghouseEven better, Tesla was highly impressed with his new partner. In fact, he was inawe of the imposing George Westinghouse, taken by the six-foot-tall man with athick swathe of hair and equally full sideburns that led down to his signaturewalrus handlebar mustache. Upon their initial meeting, Tesla admitted that his“first impression [was of a man with] tremendous potential of energy … Apowerful frame, well proportioned, with every joint in working order, an eye asclear as crystal, a quick springy step—he presented a rare example of health andstrength. Like a lion in a forest, he breathed deep and with delight the smokyair of his factories.”This high opinion was not limited to Nikola Tesla, as Westinghouse had gained aflattering reputation over the course of his adult life. But nothingWestinghouse had gained—reputation included—had been simply handed over to him.Instead, Westinghouse was a true self-made man who had earned respect and trustand with it, great success."},{"pageContent":" 9 EARNED SUCCESS [contents.xhtml#c_ch9]With Westinghouse not only in the fold but now leading the charge to introducealternating current to the world on a grand commercial scale, Edison and hisfinanciers, namely J. P. Morgan, realized they had an imminent threat at hand.After all, George Westinghouse was loved and respected by many and viewed—likeEdison—as a self-made man.From the day he came into the world in Central Bridge, New York, on October 6,1846, George Westinghouse Jr. was prone to fits of frustration and stubbornness.While his tantrums as an infant included crying hysterically, they turned intomore physical displays as he grew older, becoming so severe that he would beathis head against the wall until he got his way.“I had a fixed notion that what I wanted I must have,” George would laterconclude. “Somehow, that idea has not entirely deserted me throughout my life. Ihave always known what I wanted, and how to get it. As a child, I got it bytantrums; in mature years, by hard work.”As a boy, his fits would earn him a reputation around town and in school, and hewas soon fighting any of the many boys who called him crazy, even those biggerthan him. After one such fight, George Sr. took his son to the barn to beat himwith a switch as consequence for the altercation, and upon the weak switchbreaking in half (George Jr. was big for his age), the young boy recommended tohis father that he instead should use a leather harness that was hanging nearby,claiming it was stronger and wouldn’t break. The beating ended, but George Jr.’sproblem-solving and intuitive sense of invention had begun.George Jr. showed little interest in school but was intrigued by all thingsmechanical. His father owned a machine shop, and soon—at the urging of aninspirational clergyman who believed his mechanical inclinations should beembraced, not shunned—George, at only thirteen years old, was given a full-timeapprenticeship in the shop. The boss’s son, George learned, needed to work evenharder to earn respect, so he exerted all his energy in the shop to gain therespect of his senior colleagues.One day, as the temperature soared near one hundred degrees, George Sr. haddecided to give his employees the Saturday afternoon off. However, an order camein soon after that required a number of pipes to be cut to a specific size.Young George, being the lowest-ranking employee, was given the job and told tostay and work until it was finished. George fumed at first, promising to himselfthat if he ever ran his own business, he would give all his employees everySaturday afternoon, and even Sundays, off—a practice he started later in life,which not only began a Westinghouse business custom of having weekends off, butcontributed to it becoming a national custom as well.As George began dragging pipes to the sawhorse—still mad about the extra workhis father had assigned him—he eyed the steam engine and the lathe.An idea struck him.George mounted the pipes to the lathe and used steam power and the saw to slicethrough the pipes like butter. Although it would have taken him the rest of theday to cut the pipes with the saw by hand, with the steam-powered lathe the jobwas done in less than an hour. He returned home to a furious George Sr., who didnot believe his son’s claim that the job was done. But after he returned to theshop with young George and saw the pipes were all perfectly sized, the twowalked home with the elder’s arm firmly around the smiling youngster. Aninventor had been born.In the years that followed, George toyed with minor inventions—including arotary engine that would garner his first official patent—until everything cametogether with two of the most important inventions in his young career: the carreplacer and the air brake.The idea of the car replacer came to twenty-year-old George when he was en routefrom one of many trips from Central Bridge, New York, to other locations in NewYork to secure contracts for his father’s company. As he was returning from atrip to Albany, he was delayed by a train accident ahead of his location.George inquired about the delay, and a friend explained that two or three rearcars had jumped the tracks and needed to be placed back on the rails. Afterwitnessing the long and monotonous task of getting the cars back on the tracks,George commented that “they could have done the whole thing in fifteen minutesby clamping a pair of rails to the track, and running them off at an angle likea frog [a device used to allow trains to switch across tracks easily], so as tocome up even against the wheels of the nearest derailed car. Then, by hitchingan engine to the car, they could have shunted it back into place.”George immediately drew up plans and created a model, which he showed to hisfather. George Sr. was not impressed enough to offer financial backing, soGeorge was forced to seek investors outside his family. The salesman in Georgecame out, and he soon formed a partnership with two financiers. More important,this invention and experience brought him into close dealings with the railway,leading to the invention that would establish him as an influential person inthe business world: the air brake.Similar to the car replacer concept, the idea for the air brake came about on atrip, this one from Schenectady to Troy. Again, a rail accident delayed George’strip, an accident that was more severe than the previous one and had resulted intwo freight trains crashing into each other and creating a massive mess in theirwake.This accident, thankfully, hadn’t brought about any casualties, but George knewthat had the cars been passenger locomotives, the cost would have been deadly.As was his nature, George asked railway officials why this accident hadoccurred. The weather was clear and there were no signs of obstruction or faultytracks. He learned that it had been due to the fact that you “can’t stop a trainin a moment” because the method of stopping a train was hand-braking, whichconsisted of different brakemen applying brakes in each car, leading to unevenbrake distribution. George quickly decided the problem was the gap of timebetween the engineer sounding the stop whistle and each brakeman applying thebrakes on the wheels.If the engineer could be the one to apply all the actual brakes and not justring the alarm, a uniform braking system could be created that would be muchsafer.George experimented with ways to apply brakes simultaneously and settled on theidea of a long chain that would run under the train and be secured in one burst,quickly hitching the brakes on each wheel at the same time. The remainingproblem was how to distribute the power from the front to the back of the train.One day while he was sitting at his desk, a woman approached George with amagazine, asking him to purchase a subscription to help her pay for training tobe a teacher. George quickly said no and told the woman to try others whoactually read magazines, but the woman said she had. George looked at thewoman’s face and was captured by a charitable feeling. He opened the magazine toa random spot, and that’s when he saw an image that would lead to a successfulair brake invention.This image involved the Mont Cenis Tunnel—known today as the Fréjus RailTunnel—which runs through an elaborate mountain chain in the European Alps. Itwasn’t the image itself that captured Westinghouse’s attention; it was how thetunnels were created. As he thumbed through the magazine, George learned thatItalian engineers used compressed air as a motor to propel a locomotive up asteep mountain and had later decided that compressed air in conjunction with adrilling machine would allow them to bore their tunnel through the mountains.“The result has been a perforating machine,” George read in awe, an epiphanyforming in his mind, “moved by common air compressed to one sixth its naturalbulk, and consequently, when set free, exercising an expansive force equal tosix atmospheres.”[../images/electricwar_fig19.jpg]Mont Cenis Tunnel entranceWestinghouse decided that if compressed air could force pipe through the solidstone of a mountain, it could certainly power the length of a train to setbrakes from the front to the back in an instant. He’d found the answer he’d beenlooking for in a magazine, of all things.Complicated problems, like that of a braking system for trains, engrossed Georgeand forced him to examine every angle. He worked out the kinks of the air brakeand developed a functional system that would be much safer than the hand brakes.[../images/electricwar_fig20.jpg]Westinghouse air brakeThrough his natural sense of careful inspection and deduction, George developedhis air brake system. Trials were run and improvements were made. George wasready to sell it and get his air brakes in steady use. Not only did he expect tomake a profit, he also expected to make the railway safer. However, getting thebrakes put to use wasn’t easy. After waiting and waiting to meet the legendary“Commodore” Cornelius Vanderbilt, George was brushed off like lint, Vanderbiltlaughing at the idea that “wind” could stop a train. Westinghouse struggled tofind backing, but when he did and the air brake succeeded in trial runs forinvestors, Vanderbilt resurfaced and launched a campaign to smear GeorgeWestinghouse and the air brake in the public eye.Vanderbilt ironically appealed to the demographic Westinghouse most oftenendeared himself to in his later business dealings: the workingman. With airbrakes, there was a need for only one operator to apply the entire system, asthe brakes worked simultaneously in all cars. With rail brakes, there was thenecessity for multiple operators to apply them in each car (many operators meantmany jobs, which meant many employed men). Vanderbilt went directly to theworkforce, showing them that this silly “wind-powered” system would eliminatetheir jobs. Westinghouse, Vanderbilt claimed, didn’t care about people: eitherin terms of the safety of the common man (as he claimed air brakes were flawedand dangerous) or in terms of valuing the workingman.Westinghouse offered rebuttals, explaining that jobs would be created by hissystem, but Vanderbilt was too loud to silence, and he continued to portrayWestinghouse in a negative light. To Westinghouse, ethics were as important asthe inventions themselves, and Vanderbilt’s unethical actions led George to vownever to stoop so low in his career.In the end, a major tragic derailment of Vanderbilt’s prized train, the PacificExpress, opened the door for Westinghouse—still only twenty-two years old—and hecame into prominence and great financial success after he was issued his firstair brake patent on April 13, 1869.But George did not rest with the fully functional brake he had, and instead heperfected it and made it safer—better. The Pittsburgh-located Westinghouse AirBrake Company was established soon after, where George and his team wouldcontinually modify and perfect the system until it was an automatic air brake,which was patented in 1872. In the following years, Westinghouse madeadjustments to his invention, steadily improving his product. Business boomed asmore trains employed the air brake, which made it safer to travel on the rails.It took just under a decade, but by the fall of 1881, Westinghouse’s air brakeshad been installed and utilized in the majority of the locomotives in the world.Westinghouse, now only thirty-five years old, had earned respect for his workethic and attention to detail and also earned a reputation as a good employer,having regular dinners for his workers, giving away turkeys at Thanksgiving, andissuing bonuses. He kept to his word and gave weekends off, and he alsointroduced “piece work,” the concept of being paid based on the work you do, noton a set pay, allowing his employees to earn more through increased production.For George Westinghouse, much of what he invented came about because of reading.Just as he had come up with the idea for the air brake while reading a magazine,he would have an electric epiphany after reading a story in Engineering about analternating current system on display in London. Like one of Tesla’s flashes oflight, a vision came to Westinghouse. He knew that this secondary generatormentioned in the article—that would come to be called a transformer—was the keyto powering electric devices at different voltages over a wide span ofterritory.Westinghouse also knew that at that very moment one of his employees, namedGuido Pantaleoni, was in Italy due to the death of his father. He wiredPantaleoni to track down the inventors of this secondary generator, and in notime Pantaleoni found the two men responsible, Lucien Gaulard and John Gibbs.Though initial reports from Pantaleoni weren’t flattering, Westinghouse soonbought an option on the American patent and arranged for one of the transformersto be delivered, along with a generator that was meant to run arc lighting onalternating current.November 1885 brought Gaulard-Gibbs employee Reginald Belfield to Pittsburghwith a crate containing a Gaulard-Gibbs AC transformer. It was in such horriblecondition, though, that Guido Pantaleoni initially wanted to send it back toItaly along with his complaints. Westinghouse had another idea. Instead ofhaving a new, unknown transformer in tip-top shape, they had a transformer inneed of a rebuild, and in that, they had the opportunity to learn about themachinery inside and out. Along with Belfield, Westinghouse disassembled andessentially built a whole new design that featured H-shaped iron plates as itscore. This decision—keeping the shoddy transformer and redesigning it—turned itinto the modern-day transformer. He had created a machine that could receivehigh voltages that spanned wide distances and could reduce the power for safeuse in all buildings and homes.On January 8, 1886, George Westinghouse officially entered the electricitybusiness by incorporating Westinghouse Electric Company. From the formation ofhis company, he was met with internal grumblings that AC was not the answer, andinstead was a waste of time. A dangerous one.Westinghouse stayed the course with alternating current, believing strongly thatthis system would revolutionize the field. To begin, he decided to do the exactopposite of the showman Thomas Edison. Instead of announcing to the world thathe had an amazing system that would change the way the world was run,Westinghouse kept his initial experiments a secret. There was no pomp andcircumstance as there had been with all things Edison.For Westinghouse, the idea was to have his leading electrician, William Stanley,who knew the workings of AC and the transformer as well as anyone, introduce thesystem to his hometown of Great Barrington, Massachusetts, where Stanley hadbuilt his own laboratory. With little press and no overt announcement or publicballyhoo that Stanley was using a novel alternating current system, theexperiment took off, and more and more customers were added daily. Townsfolkwere quickly won over in a month’s time, and although the system had its kinks,the transformers were a success, indicating the time was right to officiallylaunch Westinghouse Electric.Westinghouse knew he needed to kick things off with a showplace, like Edison’sbrownstone in Manhattan. The four-story all-trade store of Adam, Meldrum &Anderson in downtown Buffalo served as the perfect setting for Westinghouse andhis new system. Buffalo was quickly becoming a booming town of innovation andcommercial activity, and the new all-purpose store had garnered a lot of chatterand anticipation as it was set to open. What better way to launch the systemthan by linking it to the launch of a much-talked-about business?On November 27, 1886, the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser announced that Adam,Meldrum & Anderson was showcasing many useful items, along with 498 Stanleylights run by the Westinghouse system. “We were the first business house in thecity to adopt the plan of lighting our stores by incandescence,” the ad read.“Come and see the grandest invention of the nineteenth century.”Back in New York, Thomas Edison was fuming. While his public statement toreporters was for them to “tell [Westinghouse] to stick to air brakes,” Edisonknew this was the beginning of a competition that would require his completeenergy and attention. George Westinghouse was lightning, and Edison knew thunderwas soon to follow.After all, this was George Westinghouse—the same person who, as a boy, wouldbeat his head against the wall until he got his way—and Edison and his DCbackers knew: this man would not simply go away. Not unless he was forced to."},{"pageContent":" 10 THE RABID ANIMAL VERSUS THE FAWN IN THE FOREST [contents.xhtml#c_ch10]The entry of George Westinghouse into the field of electricity triggered aseries of problems for Thomas Edison, resulting in one of the most trying yearsof Edison’s professional life.The year 1887 began with Westinghouse’s alternating current system sinking itsteeth into Edison’s electric pie, taking an immediate bite out of futureprospects and profits. Despite Edison’s strong prediction that “just as certainas death Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in asystem of any size,” from the get-go Westinghouse rounded up customers andimplemented his system, free of casualties. In fact, by the end of the year,Westinghouse Electric Company had 68 central stations under contract. Evenworse, Thomson-Houston Electric—known for arc lighting and already a chiefcompetitor of Edison’s—had partnered with Westinghouse, installing 22Westinghouse transformers in 1887 alone. All told, after eight years inoperation Edison Electric Company had 121 central stations, compared to close to100 for Westinghouse in 1887 alone.In one calendar year.The numbers by themselves told Edison that George Westinghouse was a seriousbusiness threat.One of the main issues, and a major contributing factor in Westinghouse’s swiftmovement and success, was the fact that Edison’s direct current system requiredmultiple power stations as opposed to alternating current, which required only asingle station on the outskirts of town. As Edison’s trusted friend andpublicist Edward Johnson attempted to explain, “We will do no small townbusiness, or even much headway in cities of minor size.” The system simplywasn’t set up to accommodate small-town America. Edison turned his deaf ear toJohnson’s warnings.Thomas Edison continued to hear rumblings internally, along with some of hislonger-tenured colleagues telling him he should switch systems immediately.Francis Upton, a Menlo Park veteran and trusted Edison employee, had firsthandknowledge and experience with the Hungarian ZBD alternating current system—namedafter inventors Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy, and Miksa Déri—and madevehement pleas with his boss to buy an option and utilize the American rights.Edison bought the rights but refused to even consider using them. His purchasewas more a ploy to keep possible competitors from using the ZBD system.Instead, in October 1887, Edison and the brass of Edison Electric Light heldfirm publicly that producing and selling AC was an unwise business decision. Asstated in the company’s annual report of 1887, AC had “no merit in itself”commercially, and in terms of its safety, the high pressure of AC made it“notoriously destructive of both life and property.” It was the company’sopinion that it was only a matter of time before alternating current destroyeditself due to its volatile nature. All Edison Electric needed to do waswithstand the initial surge and wait for the flames to rise. Edison himselfreported to his board of executives that “[Westinghouse] cannot compete with usor do us any permanent harm, and that a steady conservative policy will win thebattle.”Alternating current wasn’t the only problem that charged toward Edison in 1887.Copper prices also threatened to stomp holes in the very foundation of Edison’sdirect current system, as a monopoly over copper goods had been attained byEuropean businessman Hyacinth Secretan. With a firm grasp on the market,Secretan sent the ten-cent-per-pound price tag all the way up to seventeen centsper pound by late 1887.Here again Edison owed blame to his direct current system’s limitations andflaws. With the necessity of multiple power stations and multiple wires perstream of current, copper wire was essential. In contrast, alternating currentneeded a third of the amount of wire that direct current required. Just whenEdison was already being squeezed out of profit due to the early success ofWestinghouse’s alternating current, now what profit remained was being sappedbecause of the system’s reliance on copper wire. Edison was at the mercy of thisEuropean copper king, a man who seemed unconcerned with anything other thanmaking an extra buck.In November 1887, when Alfred P. Southwick wrote a letter to Edison asking himto vouch for the use of electricity as a more humane method of execution thanthe barbaric hangman’s noose, Edison swiftly declined to get involved, making itclear that he was not in favor of capital punishment. But Thomas Edison, whoonce said, “No competition means no invention,” knew he was involved in abattle. He just needed to find his chance to turn the tide back in his favor.Perhaps this Southwick fellow was offering to create the ripple needed to bringthe current back in his favor.In December 1887, Edison did a one-eighty and wrote to Southwick that the best,most humane manner of execution could be “accomplished by the use ofelectricity, and the most suitable apparatus for the purpose is that class ofdynamo-electric machine which employs intermittent currents. The most effectiveof those are known as ‘alternating machines.’” In his letter, Edison mentionedthat the most prominent manufacturer of these machines was George Westinghouse,directly linking—he hoped—his main competitor with the death penalty. “Thepassage of the current from these machines through the human body even by theslightest contacts,” Edison maintained, “produces instantaneous death.”With that, the year changed and so did the tide. Edison’s official endorsementof AC as a mode of public execution put him back in control, and he was certainthat 1888 would be nothing like 1887.* * *With Dr. Alfred P. Southwick now serving as the driving force behind alternatingcurrent being used as the next method of execution, Edison decided to take abold public stance against Westinghouse and his system. After all, Edison knewit would take some time for the legal channels to be navigated by Southwick andhis team. He’d wait to be called on by Southwick when the moment came, but heknew there was an opportunity here to take advantage of.In the form of eighty-four bound pages, with a bloodred cover surrounding thebold title A WARNING FROM THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY, Edison Electric leteveryone know in no uncertain terms that the alternating current system wasequal to an electric plague on humanity. With contributions written by prominentmembers of the company, the book was composed by company president EdwardJohnson and distributed to reporters and executives of various lightingutilities companies who were deciding which system to use.Five “cautions” highlighted the contents of the long warning, ranging from“caution 1” on patent infringement on his light bulb to “caution 4” on the knownand unknown dangers of alternating current. Of course, while Edison Electricmaintained that such a deadly system needed to be kept from the general public,Edison himself was supporting AC to be used for the express purpose of killingwhen it came to capital punishment.Thomas Edison, the most respected name in the scientific field of electricity,was directly warning the common man of the lurking dangers associated withalternating current, namely the system employed by George Westinghouse. “It is amatter of fact that any system employing high pressure, i.e. 500 to 2,000units,” it was explained in the red book, “jeopardizes life.” In fact, adetailed listing of AC-induced fires suggested the high currents were justtempting fate to turn a building into an inferno. He then graphically chronicledthe many fatal—and horrific—deaths as a result of AC that had been reported innewspapers around the country. At the same time, Edison made it clear that therewas “no danger to life, health, or person, in the current generated by any ofthe Edison dynamos … and even the poles of the generator itself, may be graspedby the naked hand without the slightest effect.” While alternating current wasthe rabid animal in the wild, direct current was the friendly fawn in theforest.Pulling no punches, Edison was also urging “all electricians who believe in thefuture of electricity” to “unite in a war of extermination against cheapness inapplied electricity.” It was their responsibility to champion the proper use ofelectricity, which was direct current, and outlaw the detrimental system ofWestinghouse. Edison had volunteered, as evidenced by his book, to lead thecharge against alternating current.* * *Meanwhile, the spring of 1888 brought not just the rebirth of nature’s beautybut also the reentry of Nikola Tesla into the scientific field. The Serbiangenius had filed a slew of patent applications related to alternating current,and people were talking. Tesla held public exhibitions and gained praise fromthe scientific press, but Edison wasn’t concerned with this upstart scientist.Sure, he had been granted some forty patents in a short span of time. However,Edison had had intimate dealings with this man. Edison believed that althoughTesla’s mind was sharp, when it came to business tact, Tesla was severelyoutmatched.That is, until Tesla teamed up with George Westinghouse in July 1888,threatening to land a few good punches and turn this into a knock-down, drag-outfight."},{"pageContent":" 11 DEATH IN THE WIRES [contents.xhtml#c_ch11]March 12, 1888New York, New YorkTowers of white. Two stories high in some places, these towers had been erectedovernight in downtown Manhattan. Mother Nature had been busy while mostresidents of New York City had been asleep, stacking snowflake atop snowflake tocreate the mounds of white—some that had crept dangerously close to thespiderwebbed wires overhead.Only two days prior, the temperature had been a mild fifty degrees and citydwellers were tempted by talk of an early spring. But a ferocious arctic coldfront had dipped south from Canada and mixed with a strong Gulf airstream fromparts south. On March 11, when these two systems slammed into each other andwound together in a tight combination, temperatures plummeted quickly,accompanied by a pounding attack of rain. By the time the clock struck midnighton March 12, the temperature had dropped quickly, transforming the precipitationinto freezing rain and sleet. Soon after, the winds kicked up to near sixtymiles per hour, turning the sleet into heavy sideways snow.[../images/electricwar_fig21.jpg]The Blizzard of 1888 led to the mandate that all wires in New York City beburiedWhile most people slept through the worst of the storm—what would later betermed the “Great White Hurricane”—all forms of travel had shut down by sunrise,and the towering snow had trapped those who had been caught in the storm. Theseunlucky souls would either be rescued by good Samaritans with ladders or rope orfall victim to the elements, like the four hundred people on the East Coast wholost their lives as a result of the storm.Yet another problem that had come with the storm was the impact of the rain andsnow—and the severe winds—on the overhead wires. Places like Manhattan had lostcommunication with the outside world when telephone and telegraph wires sagged.Low temperatures combined with the overwhelming weight of the snow and the highwinds and went on to break many lines altogether and scattered the remnants onthe white surface not too far below. For the next few days, all modes of masstransportation were suspended, later resulting in the idea and discussion thatperhaps there was a need for a manner of underground travel. Less than a decadelater, subways found their way into major cities.Major publications like the New York Times took the baton from the great stormand brought forth a tempest of reports and editorials attacking the manner inwhich high-voltage wires had been carelessly spread above almost every squareinch of the city. “The city is liable to be put into darkness and the consequentperils,” concluded the Times, urging—like many other papers—that allhigh-voltage wires be buried. The Times and a plethora of other periodicalsfocused on the inconveniences of electric wires, but this wasn’t altogetherunusual, since the electric wires and the nuisance that came with them had beena major topic of discussion since late in 1887, when the Edison ElectricCompany’s many red books had been sprinkled around by one Thomas Alva Edison.Free of charge, of course.This new wave of negative press for AC systems didn’t help George Westinghouse’scause. Unfortunately for Westinghouse, it was only the beginning.* * *April 15, 1888East Broadway, New York, New YorkMoses Streiffer skipped his way down East Broadway toward Catherine Street,fully enjoying the nice weather that had taken over from the tragic storm amonth prior. The boy was a peddler, selling buttons and combs and other smalltrinkets from a nearby stand.The fifteen-year-old Romanian immigrant noticed a dangling telegraph wire by hisside. As the boy approached the broken wire hanging down from the cedar posthigh above, he grabbed it. The sun was going down and the arc lights wereshowering their artificial rays toward the street, mixing in with the faint raysof sunshine soon to retire for the night.Witnesses later said Moses had immediately continued skipping around and aroundthe pole with wire in hand, as if he was involved in an entertaining game. Thegame was cut short, as was the boy’s life, when a burst of sparks engulfed hisbody. After a flash of light, he fell to the ground and lay limp. Moses wasdead.Newspapers acknowledged the death of the Streiffer boy with articles andeditorials, continuing their pleas to have the dangerous wires removed fromoverhead. In the end, the US Illuminating Company was charged with neglect forits loose wire, which had ended the boy’s life.* * *May 11, 1888616–618 Broadway, New York, New YorkIt had been a long day for workers from Brush Electric Company. They had spentmuch of their time cutting away dead wires from buildings high above the trafficon West Houston Street. A team of linemen were currently tackling the tough taskof clearing a second-story cornice of dead wires. Among the workers was ThomasH. Murray, who was dangling from the cornice.“I saw smoke curling in the window and heard a sputtering sound,” an employeeinside the building commented later on. Soon after spotting the wisp of smoke,workers found Murray dead beside an electric wire that was partially cut, theinsulating material actively burning at the severed spot. Murray had failed towear the required rubber gloves and had paid for the lapse in judgment with hislife.When others attempted to grab him and pull him from the cornice, they too wereshocked by the live current. It took multiple sheets of rubber wrapped aroundMurray before the man’s charred body could be helped off the cornice.Newspapers broadcast the tragic story, adding to the building worry of commoncitizens everywhere.* * *June 5, 1888201 West Forty-Fourth Street, New York, New YorkHe had written the letter on May 24. It had taken some time, but now, almost twoweeks later, Harold Pitney Brown—a little-known electrical engineer—held open acopy of the New York Evening Post. He looked down his substantial nose, over hisswollen handlebar mustache, and smiled as his eyes moved swiftly left to right.“The death of the poor boy Streiffer,” the letter began, “who touched astraggling telegraph wire on East Broadway on April 15, and was instantlykilled, is closely followed by the death of Mr. Witte in front of 200 Bowery andof William [Thomas] Murray at 616 Broadway on May 11, and any day may add newvictims to the list.” Brown nodded as he read. He lifted a hand and touched thepart in his hair with his index finger. “If the pulsating current is‘dangerous,’ then the ‘alternating’ current can be described by no adjectiveless forcible than damnable.”Brown focused intently as he read the portion that dealt with weakly insulatedwire. “Among electric lighting men it is appropriately called ‘undertaker’swire,’ and the frequent fatalities it causes justify the name.”His eyes skipped to the end, where he demanded alternating current over threehundred volts be outlawed to save human lives from the same fate as MosesStreiffer, Fred Witte (who died on April 28 after touching a United StatesCompany lamp), and Thomas H. Murray (who Brown had referred to as “William”Murray in his letter). Earlier in Brown’s letter, he had stated that “if thedeath of these three men can effect the adoption and enforcement of regulationssimilar to the following, they will not have died in vain.” Brown reviewed hislist of recommended regulations, nodding as he read about a limit of fiftylights on the same circuit, the necessity of a waterproof covering for outdoorarc light circuits, and ending with “no alternating current with a higherelectromotive force than three hundred volts shall be used.”Harold P. Brown closed his paper and grinned. His opinion had been validated byat least one publication, the New York Evening Post, which was owned by oneHenry Villard, who would one day happen to find himself president of EdisonElectric Light Company.* * *Only a few days later, Harold P. Brown was invited to attend a New York CityBoard of Electrical Control meeting on June 8, where his letter would be readword-for-word into the record before the board and then captured in themeeting’s minutes and passed along to a host of respected electric companies andelectricians, with George Westinghouse included.Near the same time Brown’s letter was being read before the Board of ElectricalControl, George Westinghouse was in the process of writing his own letter, datedJune 7, 1888—a letter addressed to none other than Thomas Alva Edison. In thisletter, Westinghouse offered to come together and talk like adults and perhapsreach an agreement and form a truce between them. “I have a lively recollectionof the pains that you took to show me through your works at Menlo Park when Iwas in pursuit of a plant for my house, and before you were ready for business …it would be a pleasure to me if you should find it convenient to make me a visithere in Pittsburgh when I will be glad to reciprocate the attention shown me byyou.”Five days later, Thomas Edison responded in kind, declining the Westinghouseinvitation with a curt written message: “My laboratory consumes the whole of mytime.” The following weeks found Edison and company claiming far and wide to thepress that George Westinghouse was lying about his alternating current results.Left with no hope for peace, Westinghouse knew he had to respond, but he did soby sticking to the facts related to alternating current, shedding light on thesuccess and safety he had thus far exhibited. At the next New York City Board ofElectrical Control meeting on July 16, Westinghouse presented a letter to theboard, explaining that he had—in conjunction with Thomson-Houston—established127 central stations in two years’ time, while his Pittsburgh plant was the“largest incandescent lighting station in the world.” He made it clear that whenit came to safety, the numbers spoke for themselves. Not one of his 127 stationshad experienced a fire, while a number of the 125 direct current stations hadreported fires, three of which had completely destroyed the DC central stations.In regards to Thomas Edison’s smear campaign, Westinghouse announced that he wastaken aback by the “method of attack which has been more unmanly, discreditableand untruthful than any competition which has ever come to my knowledge.”It was clear, by way of written letters and through actions, that there would beno truce. Both sides knew: this was war. And it was just getting started.* * *Just as he had done with Alfred P. Southwick (who was at that very moment stillin the process of getting the next method of execution turned over toalternating current), Thomas Edison seized the chance to have someone elsespearhead his fight against George Westinghouse. Instead of having his own faceand name in opposition to his rival, here fate had handed him Harold P. Brown, aman who was a born fighter and who had come right out and called alternatingcurrent “damnable.” Edison realized he wouldn’t even need to do the discreditinghimself; Brown would do the dirty work for him.Late June 1888 found Harold P. Brown being called on by electricians and boardmembers to actually prove his claims, while early July of the same year foundBrown in the new West Orange laboratory of Thomas Edison attempting to do justthat. Brown would later say it was he who had contacted Edison—although manywould claim it was the opposite—in hopes of borrowing some equipment to aid inhis experiments. “To my surprise,” said Brown, “Mr. Edison at once invited me tomake experiments at his private laboratory, and placed all necessary apparatusat my disposal.”Harold P. Brown set up shop in Edison’s fancy laboratory for much of July, wherehe even had the full cooperation and assistance of Edison employee ArthurKennelly and Edison’s most trusted colleague, Charles Batchelor.By the end of July, Brown was confident that he had gathered enough evidence toprove alternating current was deadly beyond any semblance of a doubt. Afterissuing invitations to all Board of Electrical Control members, representativesfrom all electric light companies, prominent members of the electricalfraternity, and members of the press, Brown greeted just over seventy guests atColumbia College. He was intent to prove his case.* * *July 30, 1888Professor Chandler’s Lecture Room,Columbia College, New York, New YorkHarold P. Brown stood upright before his esteemed audience. Each person watchinghim knew his name, and now everyone knew what he looked like. He raised his handto his slicked hair and ran his open palm over his head.“I represent no company and no commercial or financial interest,” he said with aserious stare. That point made, Brown explained the fundamental differencesbetween alternating and direct current, making eye contact with the manyelectricians in attendance, as if to say, “This part isn’t for you, my friends.I only detail the differences for the layperson who is otherwise unaware.”Noticing some expressions of disinterest, Brown quickly walked to the middle ofthe room and stood beside a large wooden cage with copper wires woven betweenthe bars. “Over the last few weeks, I have proved by repeated experiments that aliving creature could stand shocks from a continuous current much better.” Brownlowered his hand to the cage beside him. People in the audience shifted in theirseats, reporters looking at the electricians in the room, searching for answers,the electricians shrugging and scratching their heads.Brown suddenly disappeared into another room. A moment later, he walked backinto the room holding a leash connected to a large black retriever. Tugging onthe leash, Brown led the dog to the cage and forced it inside. After strappingthe dog inside, Brown slammed the barred door and locked it. Gasps and sighscould be heard from the audience; a nervous chattering wafted over the area aspeople wondered what this man was doing.Brown did not keep them guessing. Instead, he announced that the dog—whichweighed seventy-six pounds—was in good health and had no inclinations tohostility. Brown nodded to two men at the side of the room, Arthur Kennelly andDr. Frederick Peterson, who scurried to the cage and held the dog in place whileelectrodes were attached to its right foreleg and left hind leg.Brown called for three hundred volts and Arthur Kennelly flicked a switch andturned a dial and the dog shimmied left and right in the cage. The chattering inthe audience grew silent. Eyes widened.Brown gave the order for four hundred volts, then seven hundred.The sound of scraping claws reverberated around the room, and the dog whinedbetween bursts of movement. It broke free of the restraints, and Brown’s team of“scientists” were forced to open the cage and reattach the straps. More and morepeople voiced their displeasure about the spectacle before them.Brown demanded a thousand volts and all whining and yelping ceased and wasreplaced by a clenched snout that shook like a leaf in a hurricane. Some guestsdashed from the room; others begged Brown to have mercy.Harold P. Brown gestured for Kennelly to stop.“Now,” said Brown with a sly grin, “he will have less trouble when we try thealternating current.” Kennelly and Peterson assisted Brown in hooking the dogand the cage up to a Siemens Brothers alternator.Brown stepped a few feet away from the cage as Kennelly looked at him curiously.Brown called for three hundred volts and Kennelly set the current as commandedand turned it on. The dog shifted left and right briefly before collapsinginside the cage.Dead.As Brown smiled again, satisfied, he gave Kennelly the signal to turn off thecurrent.Agent Hankinson, a member of the ASPCA, stepped forward and forbade Brown fromexperimenting on any other animal.One after another, audience members rushed from the lecture hall. While somevoiced their disgust with the cruelty of the exhibition, others made a point ofcontention that it wasn’t so much the alternating current that had done the dogin, but instead it was the extended torture with direct current that hadconsiderably weakened the dog’s state.A smug Brown assured the dissenting audience that he had plenty of other dogsthat he had experimented on in the past month, claiming the “treachery” ofalternating current was to blame for the quick death of the dog. It was laterdiscovered that Brown had enlisted local neighborhood boys to gather up straydogs by applying a bounty of twenty-five cents per canine. Before sayingfarewell to his guests, Brown announced that the fatality threshold for the manydogs he’d experimented on had been three hundred volts for alternating currentand over a thousand volts for direct current. Before his visitors left, theyreceived Brown’s final thoughts that the “only places where an alternatingcurrent ought to be used were the dog pound, the slaughter house, and the stateprison.”* * *August 3, 1888Professor Chandler’s Lecture Room,Columbia College, New York, New YorkHarold P. Brown looked around at the audience, a more condensed group than he’dwelcomed a few days ago, but then again, this time he had been more selective.This crowd contained most of his colleagues, a few experts in the field ofelectricity, a handful of public health officials, and a generous helping ofreporters.“All of the physicians present,” Brown announced as he stood next to three cagesthat already housed captive dogs, “expressed the opinion that a dog had a highervitality than a man, and that, therefore, a current which killed a dog would befatal to a man.”Without further delay, Brown started the display with a sixty-one-pound dog incage number one, which he disposed of in short order with three hundred volts ofalternating current. There was no struggle. No whining. No yelping. No mess.Just a few seconds’ time and a dead dog where a live one once sat.Not to be outdone by dog number one, Brown moved on to the second cage, whichheld a ninety-one-pound Newfoundland. Only eight seconds were needed for anequally clean execution of this larger dog.Pleased with the results thus far, Brown smiled as he moved on to the finalcage. Inside was a fifty-three-pound mutt. But Brown’s smile soon faded when thedog lasted a whopping four minutes—suffering, whining, and struggling—beforekeeling over for good.With his second presentation complete, Harold P. Brown regained his smile andbid his guests a fond farewell.* * *In the month following Brown’s three-dog display, Thomas Edison met more goodfortune when the New York state legislature, thanks to Alfred P. Southwick’sguidance, officially designated electrocution as its new mode of capitalpunishment.The state legislature created a new committee to secure advice from people whowere knowledgeable about the deadly impact of electricity. This committeeappointed Dr. Frederick Peterson as its chairperson. Peterson was one ofEdison’s men, and the same man who had helped Brown with both his displays atColumbia College.Teaming up once again, Brown and Peterson happily accepted the generous offer ofThomas Edison to use his West Orange laboratory to continue their “research” onhow best to kill living creatures with electricity. Soon after, at a summativemeeting on November 15, Dr. Peterson told the rest of the committee that bothcurrents would kill but that alternating current was the preferable andrecommended choice.The committee announced that it would make its decision official on December 12at its next meeting, but Harold P. Brown wasn’t about to leave this matter withany uncertainty. Instead, he organized yet another electrical demonstration thatwould make it 100 percent clear that alternating current was the only option.Brown knew what he needed: to show how larger animals reacted to alternatingcurrent.* * *December 5, 1888Edison Laboratory, West Orange, New JerseyHarold P. Brown had pitched it as a “matter of great importance” to his esteemedaudience, made up of several reporters, employees of Edison Electric, physiciansfrom the Medico-Legal Society, and two members of the newly formed GerryCommission (the “Death Commission”), Alfred P. Southwick and Elbridge T. Gerry.Among this well-respected and highly regarded group, one man stood out andbrought great value to the group as a whole: Thomas Edison. Up to this point,Edison had only been a supplier of space and material for Brown’s experiments.He’d remained silent as to Brown’s research with animals. But now here he was inplain sight. With his mere presence he’d legitimized the entire spectacle.Reporters now looked to Brown with a newfound sense of respect, as did themembers of the Gerry Commission and the Medico-Legal attendees.Brown began his demonstration by revealing a calf, which took only thirtyseconds to be done away with. Brown followed this by disposing of a larger calfand then did the same with a horse.The next day, the New York Times declared that what had been witnessed in WestOrange had proven that alternating current was the “most deadly force known toscience, and that less than half the pressure used in this city for electriclighting [1,500–2,000 volts] by this system is sufficient to cause instantdeath.” In this one statement, Thomas Edison had achieved what he’d hoped for,in that it was now on record that alternating current was the “death current.”On the flip side, direct current now looked like a safe mode of deliveringelectricity to the public—far more safe and reliable than a system that was nowsynonymous with death.A few days later, the Medico-Legal Society officially adopted “death byalternating current” and listed its recommendations for how to administer thecurrent to criminals. Edison must have been doubly giddy to add “executioner’scurrent” to alternating current’s list of nicknames. Adding even more fuel tothe fire, Edison would recommend that executing someone with electricity shouldbe referred to as being “Westinghoused.”In response to Harold P. Brown’s assertion that he’d proven without any doubtthat three hundred volts of alternating current was deadly, George Westinghousetold numerous New York papers that “a large number of persons can be producedwho have received a one-thousand-volt shock from alternating current withoutinjury.” He summed up his company’s rebuttal by stating, “We have no hesitationin charging that the objects of these experiments is not in the interest ofscience or safety.” While some in his camp wanted him to return the smearcampaign with similar methods, Westinghouse refused to fight dirty. When askedwhy he didn’t go after Edison by returning his vicious attack, Westinghouseexplained he had learned that you “don’t play the other fellow’s game.” WhenErnest H. Heinrichs, a newspaper reporter Westinghouse hired to promote hiscompany in a positive manner, implied that perhaps that was what was needed,Westinghouse firmly refused. “By letting the others do all the talking,”Westinghouse told Heinrichs, “we shall make more friends in the end than if welower ourselves to the level of our assailants.”Harold P. Brown, though, did not appreciate Westinghouse’s statement that he wasnot being truthful about the deadly nature of alternating current. In a surrealturn of events, Brown essentially challenged Westinghouse to a sort of electricduel straight out of an old Western movie: “I challenge Mr. Westinghouse to meetme in the presence of competent electrical experts and take through his body thealternating current while I take through mine a continuous [direct] current.” Inmultiple publications, Brown explained his electric game of chicken in greatdetail, making it clear he was completely serious. “We will commence with 100volts, and will gradually increase the pressure 50 volts at a time … untileither one or the other has cried enough, and publicly admits his error.”Ever the professional, Westinghouse never responded to this odd offer to duke itout with electricity. He had no comment whenever it was brought up in public.Westinghouse publicly opposed the idea of using electricity to kill criminals,but it had been accepted as the most humane method of execution. The wheels hadbeen set in motion. In fact, a key member of the team charged with creating theelectric killing machine—soon to be the electric chair—was none other thanHarold P. Brown, named the electrical expert on the design team.Now the only question was, who would be the first person to receive such a deathsentence?Enter William Kemmler."},{"pageContent":" 12 SHOCKED … [contents.xhtml#c_ch12]August 5, 1890, 9:30 p.m.Auburn Prison, Upstate New YorkFeet slapped the floor at a rhythmic pace, steadily growing louder. Frank Fishstood up and extended a hand. In the other, he held his banjo, worn around theedges and significantly yellowed. It might have been old and stained fromconstant use, but it had been a source of needed entertainment for Fish and hiscellmate, William Kemmler. For the last couple of hours the two had beenperforming “My Old Kentucky Home” and other songs to pass the time.Earlier that day, in late afternoon, Reverend Dr. Houghton and Chaplain Yateshad come to read Kemmler his last rites, later commenting to the press thatKemmler had seemed anxious, regretful, and ready for the end. After the finalblessings had been given, a thunderstorm—riddled with lightning strikes—flashedblinding light into Kemmler’s cell. Even the man who’d said he was “ready todie” couldn’t help but flinch as thunder boomed and lightning snapped.Around the time Fish took out his banjo, the storm passed, giving way to apeaceful sunset.The cadence of steps stopped abruptly. The iron latches clicked with an echo;prison guard Daniel McNaughton yanked open the cell door and gave Kemmler ashort nod. Kemmler gripped Fish’s hand and then nodded back at the guard. Heknew McNaughton, his principal keeper, had been kind in letting the men stay upuntil this late hour. McNaughton had also shown humanity over the last few daysby reading Les Misérables to Kemmler.“Keep your courage up, Kemmler, it will all be over soon. I will follow youafter a little while,” said Fish, who was also condemned to death, though he’dbe spared a year later when his sentence was changed to life in prison.Kemmler shook Fish’s hand. “I guess I will behave all right. It can’t come toosoon for me. Being so near the end is as bad as the actual going.”The two death row cellmates let go of each other’s hands, Fish’s banjo swingingby his side as he and McNaughton left Kemmler alone in his cell.Any fleeting hopes Kemmler might have had of winning an appeal and escaping thedeathly electric experiment had been dashed not long before, when lawyer BourkeCockran had nobly fought to prove the electric chair would be just as, if notmore, inhumane and cruel than the hangman’s noose. After Thomas Edison had beenplaced in the witness stand in late July and testified that the electric chairwas indeed more humane than the gallows and was therefore the proper method ofexecution, the appeal was shot down. There was no disputing the guarantee of thegreat Thomas Edison. To most, his words were as powerful and certain as God’s.As the Albany Journal later explained, “The Kemmler case at last has an expertthat knows something concerning electricity. Mr. Edison is probably the bestinformed man in America, if not the world, regarding electric currents and theirdestructive powers.” Bourke Cockran had no choice but to concede the appeal,though his closing remarks warned that the decision was bound to bring tragedythe likes of which the world hadn’t yet experienced.Unable to sleep, William Kemmler signed his name onto scraps of paper—hisautograph was now highly sought-after, and he wanted to repay the people who’dshown him kindness during the last few months, especially Gertrude Durston, thewarden’s wife, who had taught him how to sign his name. Having never learned toread or write, Kemmler had grown proud of this newfound skill. When every pieceof paper had been signed, Kemmler lay down and closed his eyes.* * *August 6, 1890, 5:50 a.m.Auburn Prison, Upstate New York“William, it’s time,” said Warden Charles Durston, his voice shaky.William Kemmler sat on his cot in a gray sack coat and vest and yellow patternedpants. He wore a white shirt under the vest, with a black-and-white bow tie. Heran his hand over the freshly shaven patch atop his head and nodded at prisonguard Joseph Velling, who folded the razor and placed it in his pocket.Kemmler looked back at the warden and started to stand. “I’m ready to go.”The warden held up his hand, motioning for Kemmler to remain seated. The jitterywarden reached into his breast pocket and produced an official document. With asigh, he recited the new death warrant, hesitantly reading, “By a current ofelectricity sufficient to cause death.”Kemmler got to his feet and Velling cut a slit in the man’s trousers at the baseof the spine. This would be where one of the electrodes would be attached, whilethe other would be attached securely to the new bald spot on his scalp.Warden Durston turned, passed through the open iron-barred door, and walked downthe hall; Kemmler and Velling followed.It was a short death march, as the chamber that housed the electric chair wasonly down the hall from Kemmler’s basement cell. Oddly, the room was lit bygaslight, not electric bulbs. Twenty-seven witnesses—two of them handpickedreporters—sat in a wide, arching semicircle inside the death chamber as WilliamKemmler entered. One witness said the convicted murderer was a “spruce looking,broad-shouldered little man.”[../images/electricwar_fig22.jpg]Sketch of Kemmler execution in Scientific AmericanWarden Durston led Kemmler to the square, high-backed chair located in thecenter of the back wall, the witnesses half-encircling him now. The woodenchair, which many said reminded them of an easy chair, had a seat of perforatedwood and arms two inches wide, with three wooden braces across the back, theupper two fastened to a hard rubber cushion. A rounded rubber cup—the lowerelectrode inside—jutted inward from the bottom of the chairback, with a wiretrailing toward the far wall. A metal cap hung stiffly from an adjustable arm atthe top of the chair, a long wire leading up to the ceiling. Inside the cap wasthe upper electrode, which would be placed against Kemmler’s scalp. A smallsponge surrounded each electrode to allow better contact and prevent scorchingof the flesh.“Give me a chair,” announced Warden Durston, startling the witnesses, whothought he was referring to the chair of death. A regular kitchen chair waspushed forward, in front of and slightly to the right of the electric chair, andKemmler was directed to sit down facing the witnesses. Warden Durston asked foranother chair and placed it next to the seated Kemmler. He put his arm aroundKemmler’s shoulders.“Now, gentlemen, this is William Kemmler,” said Durston. Kemmler bowed slightlytoward the audience. “I have just read the death warrant to him and have toldhim he has got to die,” said Durston. The warden’s hands and voice trembled. Heturned toward Kemmler. “Have you anything to say?”William Kemmler began to stand but instead remained seated. “Gentlemen, I wishyou all good luck,” he said, gazing over the crescent moon of onlookers. “Ibelieve I am going to a good place, and I am ready to go. I want only to saythat a great deal has been said about me that is untrue. I am bad enough. It iscruel to make me out worse.” He bowed again and then rose to his feet.The warden motioned to Kemmler. “Take off your coat,” he ordered, his voicestill unsure. He then cut off the tail of the shirt, which had been stickingthrough the slit in the man’s trousers, exposing his bare skin for the lowerelectrode. “Sit there,” he said, pointing to the electric chair.Velling and Durston fastened the eleven straps to secure Kemmler’s body to thechair. The warden’s hands were shaking.Kemmler whispered, “My God, Warden, can’t you keep cool? Take your time.”The metal cap was lowered onto the shaved spot on Kemmler’s head, the electrodeinside pressed firmly to his scalp.Dr. Fell emerged with a syringe. He applied a generous amount of saltwatersolution to the sponges. When his job was done, he moved back and stood besideAlfred P. Southwick, who was staring at his invention, which was now, before hisvery eyes, fully realized.The warden placed a leather mask over Kemmler’s face. He tightened the straps sothe nose was pressed back, Kemmler’s mouth the only portion still visible towitnesses.Dr. Edward Charles Spitzka, the principal doctor in charge, moved to the back ofthe chair and placed the lower electrode through the clothing and against theskin at Kemmler’s spine. “God bless you, Kemmler.”Kemmler nodded slightly.The multiple physicians present had debated how long the current should be lefton. In the end, they decided Dr. Spitzka would give the command when the currentshould begin and when it should end. The plan was to hold the charge for twentyseconds. Dr. Spitzka asked for and received a stopwatch to keep the time.Two doctors inspected the straps and connections to make sure everything was setup according to plan. After they both conferred and agreed it was ready, onesaid, “God bless you, Kemmler, you have done well.”The witnesses, many of whom were shaking, sweating, and tearing up, now noddedin agreement. “You have,” said a few of them.Warden Durston moved over to the wall separating the death chamber from a smallroom. Inside this control room, Edwin F. Davis, a prison electrician, was incharge of a switchboard that held the many knobs and switches. Like spaghettinoodles, wires jutted out from the board and trailed through the window and upto the roof. The wires snaked around the prison’s signature dome and thendropped down into a room on the second floor that held the massive dynamo,almost a thousand feet from the death chamber.“Ready?” Warden Durston asked the control room. A knock on the wall signaled thedynamo had reached the proper voltage. Durston turned to the physicians. “Do thedoctors say it is all right?”Dr. Spitzka looked at his team, who nodded. Then he looked back at the maskedKemmler and said again, “God bless you.”Kemmler nodded as he had before.Dr. Spitzka addressed the warden. “All right.”“Goodbye,” Durston said softly to Kemmler, his voice still uneven. He rapped onthe wall twice, which was the preset signal to the control room that it wastime.Edwin F. Davis watched the bulbs in the control room light up. The voltage wasset. He pulled down the switch that placed the chair in circuit.Back in the chamber, Kemmler’s body stiffened. His fingers grasped the chair ashis chest bulged forward against the restraints. The index finger of his righthand bent with such force it pressed his nail into his palm, blood dripping fromthe laceration. His mouth twitched and grimaced, but no sound came from hislips.Witnesses wriggled in their seats like they felt the current, too, and manylooked away from the dying man.Dr. Spitzka held the stopwatch to his face, where he saw it had been tenseconds, and then peered back at Kemmler.“Stop!” he cried a moment later. The command echoed throughout the room.Warden Durston rapped hard on the wall again, prompting Davis to pull the switchto take the chair out of circuit. It had been seventeen seconds.Instantly, Kemmler’s body relaxed and slumped against the eleven straps holdinghim to the chair.“He’s dead,” said Dr. Spitzka.Spitzka asked the other doctors to examine the body to confirm death, pointingout the paleness of his skin, the brightened nose. The doctors nodded inagreement, and by all accounts, William Kemmler had been successfully executedby way of electricity, in a mere seventeen seconds.Warden Durston detached the electrode from Kemmler’s head by lifting the metalcap a few inches. Witnesses that made up the scientific community immediatelybegan to congratulate one another and shake hands, as many of them were thereonly to witness the manner in which the chair would work. All appearedpleased—this had been a successful experiment.Alfred P. Southwick stepped forward and faced the satisfied witnesses. A decadein the making, and this was his moment. He gestured toward Kemmler’s limp body.“There is the culmination of ten years’ work and study.” Southwick wore a widegrin. He knew this was a significant victory for his invention, and he also knewThomas Edison had just experienced a crucial moment in his battle againstalternating current. He cleared his throat and continued. “We live in a highercivilization from this day.”But Southwick’s speech was cut short when a witness pointed to the blooddripping in pulsating fashion from the cut on Kemmler’s hand, which had beencaused by his fingertip digging into his palm.Eyes grew wide; the doctors exchanged worried looks. If the blood was stilldripping from the wound, it meant his heart had to be beating.“Great God!” cried one of the doctors.Kemmler’s chest heaved. “See,” said another doctor. “He breathes!”“Turn on the current!” hollered Dr. Spitzka. “Turn on the current, instantly!This man is alive!”"},{"pageContent":" 13 … TO DEATH [contents.xhtml#c_ch13]August 6, 1890, 6:45 a.m.Auburn Prison, Upstate New YorkThe witnesses’ faces grew as pale as Kemmler’s skin.Kemmler’s body twitched slightly. The onlookers stepped back on instinct. AlfredP. Southwick, who moments before had begun a victory speech, moved back to thefar wall and stood next to Dr. Fell. They watched.Kemmler groaned.One of the two reporters present called out, “For God’s sake, kill him and haveit over.” Then the man fainted and was caught by neighboring witnesses. Theylaid him down on a nearby bench and fanned air on his face.Blood trickled from Kemmler’s ruptured hand to the floor, a small puddle formingquickly.“Have the current turned on,” Dr. Spitzka shouted to Durston.The warden was a visible mess, shaking and trembling. He dashed to the wall andrapped twice, but nothing happened.A thousand feet away, in the second-floor room, the massive dynamo had beenpowered down. Edwin F. Davis sent a two-bell alarm to the men in charge of thedynamo, the heart of the device, signaling them to turn the machine back on atonce. But there was a problem. Since Dr. Spitzka and Durston had already orderedthe dynamo shut down, the voltmeter was near zero. It needed time to kick backinto gear and reach sufficient voltage. Davis couldn’t open the circuit and runcurrent to the chair until the dynamo had been powered up.All anyone could do was wait. A minute passed.Kemmler’s groaning turned into a strained wheeze at regular intervals, as if hewas desperately trying to breathe.Two witnesses got sick; several were forced to turn away. The unconsciousreporter was still being fanned as he lay on the bench.George T. Quinby, the district attorney who had prosecuted Kemmler, was sounnerved he rushed from his chair and out of the chamber, holding his stomach.He later passed out in the hallway.Two minutes after the command had been given to restart the current, thevoltmeter held the proper reading and Davis signaled that the charge was coming.Durston looked at the doctors, who all stepped away from Kemmler’s body quickly,not wanting to have the current jump from him to them.Durston knocked twice and a click came from the other side of the wall as Davisopened the circuit.Kemmler’s body shot into a statuesque pose, back arched and chest puffed out.The straps grew taut and creaked to restrain him. There was no more sound fromKemmler’s mouth—no groaning or wheezing.Dr. Spitzka cautiously moved closer to examine Kemmler’s body, but WardenDurston made it clear how this round would go as he yelled to Edwin F. Davis inthe control room, “Keep it on! Keep it on!”Kemmler’s head smoked. In haste, the electrode had not been securely fastened asbefore, and the sponge now held little saltwater solution. A spark formed in thespace between the electrode and the bare spot on his scalp, scorching the skinand giving off a smell of burning flesh that hung like a cloud in the deathchamber. The lower back of the chair seemed to catch fire, but it was actuallythe other electrode as it also sparked and set the back of the vest and shirtaflame.Dark spots—a combination of purple and black—formed on the visible parts ofKemmler’s skin.Finally, Warden Durston called out, “Cut the current! Cut the current!”Davis shut down the death machine for good.How long the current had been left on would be a source of great debate in thedays to come. Some claimed it was on for four and a half minutes, while otherssaid two. The official report, though, stated William Kemmler had received twothousand volts of electricity for seventy seconds.Someone extinguished the flames on Kemmler’s back, leaving a smoking lump ofmutilated body. Many witnesses got sick again. The team of doctors examinedKemmler thoroughly, taking no chances this time, and declared his death sometime around 6:51 a.m.Witnesses tried to rush from the room, many with hands cupped over their mouthsand noses, but all were forced to sign an official death certificate beforeleaving. Oliver A. Jenkins, the Erie County sheriff, had tears in his eyes as heleft Kemmler’s smoking corpse behind.At 6:52, in the telegraph center that had been crudely thrown together acrossthe street at the New York Central Railroad station, the first tap of atelegraph set off a torrent of clicks as reporters wired the news all over theworld.In the prison, Alfred P. Southwick did not finish the victory speech he’dstarted some fifteen minutes prior. Just as he knew Thomas Edison would acceptthe news, the inventor of the electric chair knew this was a vicious defeat.Despite a legal mandate limiting the press from reporting details on theexecution, Southwick knew word would spread like fire. Both the electric chairand alternating current would be seen as failures, severely harming their publicreputation and perception.Numerous doctors, including Dr. Spitzka, later claimed they were certain thefirst jolt had killed Kemmler. Although Southwick considered the execution agreat success (though he’d admit the initial charge should have been left onlonger), he knew this was a blaze he could not contain on his own.Alfred P. Southwick, the dentist-turned-executioner, desperately hoped ThomasEdison had the means to extinguish the bonfire before it destroyed all they hadworked so hard to create."},{"pageContent":" 14 IN KEMMLER’S WAKE [contents.xhtml#c_ch14]In modern times, social media allows the immediate broadcast of news and anequally immediate reaction from the masses. Unlike in the late 1800s, todaythere is no wait time needed for the facts to be gathered, the report to bewritten, the article to be printed, and the publication to be distributed byhand. News circulated much slower in the late nineteenth century. But the newsof Kemmler’s botched electrocution spread swiftly, finding its way into everymajor publication within hours, and the days that followed brought forthreactions from all sides.George Westinghouse’s statement was one of understandable horror. “It has been abrutal affair,” he said publicly, though one can’t be sure if he was referringto the execution as “brutal,” or the entire back-and-forth battle betweenhimself and Edison. Perhaps he meant both. “They could have done better with anax.” Historians would later debate whether Westinghouse intentionally tied thedeath to Kemmler’s mode of murder by mentioning an ax. After all, Kemmler wasknown as the “hatchet fiend” to the general public. “My predictions have beenverified,” Westinghouse added. “The public will lay the blame where it belongsand it will not be on us. I regard the manner of the killing as a completevindication of all our claims.”Bourke Cockran, Kemmler’s defense lawyer, echoed the sentiments of Westinghouse:“It is a sort of ghastly triumph for me. The experts against me on the trialfigured it all out that such a shocking thing [an electric execution gonehorribly wrong] was impossible and yet it has just happened.” Cockran wronglypredicted that “no other state will adopt the electrical execution law.” Ohiowould later adopt the method as common practice in 1896, followed byMassachusetts in 1898. By 1913, twelve states had adopted the electric chair forcapital punishment. That total would rise to twenty-six by 1949 when WestVirginia joined the group.In contrast to Cockran and Westinghouse, dentist Alfred P. Southwick viewed thefirst electrical execution as a great success. Sure, he admitted, thisparticular execution had had some problems. But, he reasoned, that was to beexpected, given the fact that this was the maiden voyage of the chair. “I tellyou,” Southwick said to reporters, “this is a grand thing, and is destined tobecome the system of legal death throughout the world.” His words, inretrospect, were surprisingly prophetic.Thomas Edison understood the press—he’d had ample experience with it over theyears—and he knew how the news would be received by the public. Using histactful approach, Edison responded to the New York Times at his home inLlewellyn Park, New Jersey, by stating he wished not to discuss the particularsuntil he had had time to review the reports. That gave him some time to craft areply. Once he did respond, Edison explained—with a calm and composeddemeanor—that Kemmler undoubtedly died instantly. He added that the excitementof the moment surely had an effect on those in charge of the execution process,and on witnesses. With his signature confidence, he claimed that the next to diein the chair would do so without incident.Nikola Tesla, unlike the others, could not be reached for immediate comment.After a year working with Westinghouse in Pittsburgh on alternating current,Tesla had decided to leave the laboratory. Tesla still supported and respectedGeorge Westinghouse, but he no longer worked with the Westinghouse team. So whenreporters tried to contact him for comment, Nikola Tesla was nowhere to befound. It would not be until some forty years later that Tesla commented thatthe very idea of electrocution was wrong because “an individual under suchconditions, while wholly bereft of the consciousness of the lapse of time,retains a keen sense of pain, and a minute of agony is equivalent to thatthrough all eternity.”In one of the most mysterious disappearances in American history, Harold P.Brown—writer of vehement letters to the editor, experimenter of animalelectrocution, and challenger of electric duels—vanished following theexecution. Brown was an apparition, appearing from out of nowhere to write theletter to the editor and bring down alternating current and then retreating backto nowhere once he’d accomplished what he’d set out to do.* * *The year leading up to the first execution had included a series of relativevictories for Thomas Edison, the first of which was alternating current beingtermed the “executioner’s current.”In early 1889, with the economy tightening on Edison, financiers J. P. Morganand Anthony J. Drexel proposed a merger between Edison Electric Light Companyand Drexel, Morgan and Company. On April 24, 1889, this agreement resulted inthe creation of Edison General Electric Company.More good news followed when the price of copper, which direct current needed anample supply of to run its system, came down in 1889 after Hyacinth Secretanrealized he had misjudged the uniform willpower of the electric world. When theprice had been pushed so high, the executives of the electric companies simplyrefused—across the board—to pay the outrageous price Secretan had hung on hiscopper monopoly. Edison and the rest of the field had called the coppersyndicate’s bluff.Edison’s long-standing light bulb patent court case, which essentially chargedthat every existing incandescent bulb model was owing to his design, was ruledin his favor on October 4 of that year, by Justice Bradley. The United StatesCircuit Court had considered the case for more than a few years, only to rulethat these “patent pirates” had one man—and one design—to thank for anysubsequent model: Thomas Edison.Even with the William Kemmler fiasco at Auburn Prison, Thomas Edison’s businesswas soaring.* * *In a similar manner, George Westinghouse’s business boomed in 1890.Even with alternating current firmly linked to the electric chair, the monthsthat followed the Kemmler debacle were stellar for Westinghouse Electric. InOctober of that year, Baltimore, Maryland, had come through with the purchase ofa six-thousand-light alternating current system, one of the largest to date.Another order was put in for 1,500 lights in two different states, in southernNew York and Nebraska. Like dominoes, large orders continued to fall into placefor George Westinghouse.Things had been so good, in fact, that Westinghouse had extended his businessinterests to electric streetcars and arc lighting, the sales of which also tookoff that year.By the end of 1890, Westinghouse Electric Company was bringing in a whoppingfour million dollars in annual sales.* * *All good things come to an end, they say, and this was no more evident than atthe tail end of 1890, when the economy crashed in London, England, threatening acollapse in the US as well.In mid-November 1890, the world’s most prestigious banking house, London-basedBaring Brothers & Company, was rumored to be filing for bankruptcy. This panicrelated to risky Baring Brothers investments with Argentina, which was itselfenduring a recession. Although a consortium of prominent banks would bandtogether to create a fund and guarantee the Barings’ debts, the effects in theUS were monumental, leading all major investors and creditors to begin callingin their loans. In turn, Edison General Electric and Westinghouse Electric bothgot caught in the Barings Brothers panic crossfire, forcing both electricpioneers to make drastic moves to save their respective livelihoods.Edison GE president Henry Villard had his finger on the pulse of the world’seconomic state and knew that the North American Bank—a major source of Edisoncapital—had collapsed. Villard quickly discussed a possible merger with CharlesCoffin of Thomson-Houston, which had also discussed a possible merger withWestinghouse Electric. Thomas Edison, of course, would hear no talk of apossible merger.In February 1891, Edison turned to his chief financier, J. P. Morgan, who sidedwith Edison. “I do not see myself how the two things [Edison Electric andThomson-Houston] can be brought together,” Morgan concluded about the possiblemerger.On into 1892, Edison Electric board members urged Thomas Edison to considerswitching to alternating current. Villard broke it down in monetary terms,suggesting that the amount of money lost when sticking to the long-distancedirect current system was crippling them financially. Edison was a stubborn mulewho wouldn’t budge, no matter how much Villard and the others tried to convincehim.Then, on February 5, 1892, Thomas Edison was told by his personal secretary,Alfred O. Tate, that the merger was going to go through. “His complexionnaturally was pale,” Tate later said in his memoirs, “a clear healthy paleness,but following my announcement it turned as white as his collar.”In the end, post-merger Edison shareholders controlled even less of the companythan Thomson-Houston. Thomas Edison had lost so much he held only 10 percent ofEdison General Electric Company stock, putting him in a precarious situation.Edison made claims that he had grown tired of the business and could not “wastemy time over electric-lighting matters” because he had “a lot more new materialon which to work.” His statements painted the picture of a man who wanted tolower his stock in the company, not of a man who had lost so much in his battlewith Westinghouse and his stubborn stance to stick with DC. Edison had not onlylost control of his company, but the company itself lost Edison’s name, changingfrom Edison General Electric to simply General Electric.Edison himself, the consummate showman, put on a proud face, claiming he was onboard with the merger, while also claiming electricity wasn’t his only concern.“Electric lights are too old for me,” Edison stated. The great wizard stayed onand championed direct current, for he had vested so much in and fought so hardfor the system, but his marginalization bruised his pride, along with hiswallet.George Westinghouse was not immune to the Baring Brothers panic. Upon the firstreport of the Baring Brothers rumors, Westinghouse immediately sat down and ranthe numbers, determining he needed half a million dollars to pay off hiscreditors and retain Westinghouse Electric. Westinghouse approached his ownstockholders to raise the money needed, but the great panic was so strong theeffort fell short of reaching the magic number. He was ever the cherished boss,and a group of his employees came together and offered to work for half wagesuntil the crisis had been averted. Westinghouse, proud of his company for thegesture, declined the offer.The next course of action was to appeal to the prominent bankers in his homecity of Pittsburgh and ask them to stand with him at this critical time. Whenthe committee of bankers heard his pleas, Westinghouse showed his sense ofconfidence that the crisis would pass by offering his mansion, which he called“Solitude,” as collateral. The committee agreed to review the proposal and goover the figures at once.Then, on December 10, the board of directors of Westinghouse Electric agreed toraise the required half million by creating and selling preferred stock. In thesuccessive days, a slew of businessmen and banks offered up varying amounts offunds, and traded for stock at an inflated price. All seemed well, until a roguebanker decided George Westinghouse was on the ropes and suggested they had theopportunity to seize operating control of the company due to the inventor’s direstate. Westinghouse, though, simply said that was impossible. Then he got up,smiled at the collection of moneymen, told a few jokes, thanked them for theirconsideration and time, and left. This was his company. That would never change,not while he still lived and breathed.In 1891, Westinghouse continued to turn over all stones to solve his loomingfinancial dependency. When he met August Belmont, of Wall Street investmenthouse August Belmont & Company, Westinghouse believed he might have found amatch. The tentative plan that was proposed with Belmont involved selling achunk of stock by having existing shareholders turn in 40 percent of their stockand accept a much lower value, and then turning around and paying the greedycreditors with the new preferred stock. This would work, Westinghouse knew, butone stipulation remained that might ruin the deal. According to the terms,Westinghouse had to eliminate “doubtful values and the book value of patents.”In the end, the major issue was Nikola Tesla’s patent royalty deal, which wassucking vast sums of money from the company.Though he’d remained in contact and advised Westinghouse Electric wheneverpossible, Nikola Tesla had been away from the Pittsburgh lab for more than ayear, spending most of his time living in hotels and eating out, habits thatwould remain a constant for the rest of his life. He’d traveled to Europe, metwith experts in many fields of science, and then returned to New York, where hestarted a new laboratory on Fifth Avenue, dipping his toes into many differentelectric experiments, including a protofluorescent bulb that was filament- andwire-free. His wealth from his Westinghouse deal had afforded him to live a lifethat was essentially free of material want and spend money carelessly, knowinghis deal would continue to churn out profits throughout his life.In early 1891, George Westinghouse paid a visit to Tesla’s lab. After hearingabout and seeing Tesla’s latest discoveries, his old boss shared the news aboutthe company’s financial crisis. In Westinghouse’s signature no-nonsense mode, heinquired with Tesla about the possibility of terminating his AC patent contractand waiving his present and future royalties.Tesla asked what would happen if he refused, to which Westinghouse said he wouldlose control of the company to the banks. It would no longer be his company torun.“If I give up the contract,” Tesla said, “you will save your company and retaincontrol? You will proceed with your plans to give my polyphase system to theworld?”Westinghouse nodded and did him one better, telling the Serbian genius what hewould do even if he lost control of the company. “I believe your polyphasesystem is the greatest discovery in the field of electricity … I intend tocontinue, no matter what happens, to proceed with my original plans to put thecountry on an alternating current basis.”Nikola Tesla, seeing the future of alternating current hanging in the balance,didn’t hesitate in weighing the value of financial gain against the survival andutilization of his alternating current system.“The benefits that will come to civilization from my polyphase system mean moreto me than the money involved.” Tesla stood and grinned at his friend. Then heheld up two documents. “Here is your contract and here is my contract—I willtear both of them to pieces and you will no longer have any troubles from myroyalties.” Nikola Tesla had given up a fortune to see his vision—his flash oflight—become a reality.In July 1891—with Tesla’s contract no longer an issue—a new board was organizedto help stabilize Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company, with GeorgeWestinghouse in operational control. He had done it."},{"pageContent":" 15 ALL THE WORLD’S A STAGE [contents.xhtml#c_ch15]During the Gilded Age, the world was beginning to come together in terms ofcommunication. Improvements to the telegraph and the advent of the telephoneallowed people to communicate over long distances. Postal carriers and railwaysallowed items to be delivered across the country with more ease than in thepast. News communication via telegraph allowed current events to be disseminatedin various print publications more easily than in previous decades. But evenwith these new innovations, the world of the late 1800s was nothing like it istoday, where the average citizen can immediately connect with anyone elseanywhere on the globe.One major event that united people from different countries all over was calledthe world’s fair. Held every few years, the tradition can be credited to theFrench, who would routinely put on national exhibitions that featured the bestthe nation had to offer related to a specific theme, like the 1844 IndustrialExhibition in Paris, which focused on the most exciting industrial andtechnological developments in the country. This tradition spread to a worldwidefair, which moved from one nation to another, with different themes. Each waslike a worldwide all-star extravaganza that revolved around the given theme.These world’s fairs, with the collection of esteemed people from so manynations, served as the place to show off whatever was new and exciting. It wasthe only way, in fact, to display an innovation for a diverse audience at onegiven time. In a way, the world’s fairs of the past were like today’s internetbecause they showcased a device to widely disparate eyes at one time.In 1893, a new world’s fair was coming to the United States, and dignitariesfrom all over would be in Chicago, Illinois, for what was being called theWorld’s Columbian Exposition. Of course, with electricity as the most prominentof sciences of the time, inventors and businessmen knew that gaining the rightto power the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago would be the ultimateshowcase of their system. This set up a showdown between Westinghouse and AC,and General Electric and DC. Whichever company could win the contract to powerthe new world’s fair would have the attention of all the most important peoplein the world. The ultimate stage had welcomed our key players.* * *May 16, 1892Rookery Building, Chicago, IllinoisAll eyes stared at the iron box atop the long, sturdy table. The box was blackand had been polished to a dull sheen. It had no markings or decoration. Just alarge box, it appeared, so plain and unassuming that it would seem nothing ofvalue could be contained within. But that was far from the truth, since insidewere the bids from General Electric and Westinghouse Electric to light and powerthe upcoming 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago.A key hung in the cigar-smoke-thickened air, the peering eyes so focused on thejagged item that the hand holding it might as well have been invisible. The keydropped down to the box, cutting the smoke and silence as it moved. Half the keydisappeared with an echoing click. The key turned and then stopped with a secondclick.Silence.Two hands captured everyone’s focus, one hand holding the side of the black box,the other slowly lifting the hinged door, opening it wide.A deep voice announced that there were two bids.The captivated eyes around the room followed the hands as they dropped down anddisappeared inside the box and then reappeared with two small envelopes.Nervous chattering and murmuring beat down the silence.The first bid belonged to General Electric, explained the deep voice—the ownerof the attention-grabbing hands, Daniel H. Burnham, the Chicago World’s Fair’sdirector of works. The middle-aged man looked around the room at the hypnotizedaudience and then announced the bid, which came in at $554,000.The nervous chattering returned, along with a few short laughs, as this bid wasnothing compared to the first one General Electric had issued less than twomonths prior. That offer, though, had come when there had been no seriouscompetition. But things had changed.Burnham made it known that the other envelope contained the WestinghouseElectric bid. With a slight grin, Burnham announced the Westinghouse bid of$399,000, concluding that the contract was awarded to Westinghouse.Captain Eugene Griffin, second vice president of General Electric, shot to hisfeet. With balled fists and a set jaw, Griffin reminded Burnham about animportant matter: the Edison light bulb patent litigation. As everyone wasaware, the injunction was all but certain to be ruled in General Electric’sfavor. What wasn’t set in stone was whether the ruling would mandate thatGeneral Electric would still be forced to sell its bulbs to Westinghouse andother companies. Griffin made it clear that once the case had been decided, GEwould no longer sell bulbs to Westinghouse Electric, making it unwise for Fairofficials to award the contract to Westinghouse.Burnham got lost in a huddle of quick-talking men, all with their heads shakingand hands moving wildly. These fellow Committee on Grounds and Buildings membersseized the director of works and took shelter in a locked room to discuss thematter discreetly before committing to a decision.George Westinghouse caught the eye of his friend Charles Terry. Westinghousenodded. This was not surprising. At every turn Thomas Edison had thwartedWestinghouse’s sale and promotion of alternating current, and now CharlesCoffin—the new president of General Electric—had taken up the same charge. Terrynodded back at Westinghouse. They both knew Westinghouse had made a low andenticing offer, one which would barely—if at all—result in profit. But it was anoffer the committee wouldn’t be able to refuse, and it was an opportunity togain something even more valuable than financial profit: it would allow theirelectrical system to be seen by all. Not just those in the electric fraternity,and not just those in the US, but people from all over the world. You couldn’tput a price tag on that kind of publicity and exposure.Confident but anxious, George Westinghouse stood up when the committeereappeared at seven p.m. to inform their eager audience that they would needmore time to decide. Burnham told both sides they would be consulting their teamof lawyers and would be in touch when they had made a decision, leaving thelatest battle undecided. For now.George Westinghouse nodded again. The World’s Columbian Exposition was meant tosignify the four hundredth anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s arrival inAmerica, and at the same time showcase the industrial and cultural might of theworld. This was the perfect setting to display the safe and effectivealternating current system, and George Westinghouse was not about to have thedoor slammed in his face, especially after he had almost missed the opportunityto begin with.* * *Less than two months prior, on April 2, 1892, the same iron box had alsofeatured two bids. One had been the Charles Coffin–issued General Electric bidof a whopping $1,720,000, while the other had come from a small Chicago-basedbusinessman named Charles F. Locksteadt, who had submitted a relativelyminuscule $625,600 offer on behalf of South Side Machine and Metal Works.Mere numbers indicated the Locksteadt bid was significantly better than thelofty General Electric figure, but the major hang-up was as substantial as thedifference between the two bids: Charles F. Locksteadt was a relative nobody inthe electrical field; his name didn’t inspire any confidence that he couldactually follow through with such an undertaking.All along, Charles Coffin knew he had the Fair’s board of directors where hewanted them, as the new Edison-free General Electric “trustification” heldleverage over every other struggling business in the field, thanks in large partto the economic panic that had forced Thomas Edison to lose control of hisbusiness with the Thomson-Houston merger.George Westinghouse, in fact, had just battled for more than a year to maintaincontrol of his own company, which was the main reason he had steered clear ofputting forth an offer. By the time Westinghouse had held on to his business andestablished Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company, the World’s Fair bidshad already been submitted.Charles Coffin knew Westinghouse had missed the window to compete for theFair—or so he thought—leaving him more than comfortable to issue such a massivebid. As a sign of how much had changed in the last half year, when the World’sFair officials had bargained with Chicago Edison in October 1891 for arc lightsto use for construction, they had settled on a price of $11.00 per arc light.Now, only six months later, Coffin and the General Electric crew had raisedtheir price tag to $38.50.When Fair officials had opened the iron box for that first time on April 2, theyhad begun considering the two offers. No immediate decision was made, whichsuggested they were not completely sold on either offer. Charles F. Locksteadtsensed he had a chance, and he quickly approached George Westinghouse aboutteaming up. This was a second chance for Westinghouse—a new window ofopportunity had opened for him.Upon Westinghouse’s acceptance to team up with Locksteadt, World’s Fairpresident Harlow Higinbotham decided to reset the bidding and begin anew for allconcerned, leading to the second reveal of the iron box—a second round of bidsthat was now going before a team of lawyers, keeping both sides of the war onedge.* * *May 23, 1892Rookery Building, Chicago, IllinoisGeorge Westinghouse set down his black umbrella beside his chair. He ran hisopen palms over his dark formal suit, making sure he was presentable. He gazeddown at the large table, which looked almost identical to the way it had lookeda week ago. This time, though, there was no iron box arresting everyone’sattention.Westinghouse sat down and addressed the familiar company with his eyes. Henodded at his friend Charles Terry just as he had a week prior. The telegramthat had beckoned him the day before had led to his half-day journey fromPittsburgh to Chicago aboard his private railcar, the Glen Eyre. Now it was timeto hear the verdict.Chicago World’s Fair director of works Daniel H. Burnham addressed his audience,explaining that after due consideration they had decided to bestow the contracton Westinghouse Electric. But, Burnham quickly added, they were going to splitthe contract in two.George Westinghouse shook his head. No, he explained, that would not do. He hadpresented the lowest bid, and now, he concluded, his “first-class apparatus”should be granted the entire job. He ran his fingers over his signaturemuttonchop facial hair. Then he made it clear he felt he should be given theentire contract.Burnham’s eyes moved from one committee member to the next. They werespeechless.GE’s second vice president Captain Griffin smirked, bringing up the light bulbpatent lawsuit again. Westinghouse had a strong bluff, but Griffin knew he hadthe legal threat stashed away in his hand. To Griffin, his card trumpedWestinghouse’s.Once again Burnham and the committee retreated to a private room, coming outsoon after to ask George Westinghouse a direct and loaded question: Would he andWestinghouse Electric put up a one-million-dollar bond guaranteeing thecontract, even if the light bulb matter didn’t fall in their favor?Westinghouse nodded without hesitation. He explained that they had already movedin a direction that no longer relied on Edison and General Electric’s bulbs. Hedidn’t show any signs of anxiety about the fact that he’d have to front fivehundred thousand dollars for the one-million-dollar bond.Burnham and the board members met privately again, not surfacing until seventhirty p.m. Burnham announced that Westinghouse had gained the contract as heapproached the satisfied man with an extended arm and an open hand. Smiles wereexchanged as hands shook on the agreement, with signed contracts to follow.Captain Griffin and his General Electric representatives rushed to the door. Ina huff, Griffin made it clear that once the courts had ruled in their favor,Westinghouse would “not be able to make his own lamps … we will not let himcontinue his contract.”Griffin made his dramatic exit and all eyes returned to George Westinghouse fora reply. The confident man didn’t feel it necessary to address Griffin’s threat,saying only that Westinghouse Electric had already come to a resolution for thelight bulb problem. Instead of detailing this resolution, he turned to themembers of the press in attendance and said, “I shall put in ten or twelvedynamos of 12,000 lamp capacity and furnish a clean-cut, first-class system. Ihave about 100,000 lamps, either completed or partly so, at the works, and therewill be no difficulty in furnishing material. I am required to have between5,000 and 10,000 lamps installed by the 1st of October. This is an easy task.”But it wasn’t an easy task, and George Westinghouse knew it. He had secured thecherished contract, but now he essentially had to design machinery for anentirely new system of electrical operation and construct a new light bulb thatdidn’t infringe on Edison’s patent, and he needed to do this in just over onecalendar year.* * *May 25, 1892Westinghouse Machine Shop, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania“How soon may I have four of them?”That was George Westinghouse’s question to his lead draftsman, E. S. McClelland.The day before, after he had made the journey back from Chicago to Pittsburghovernight aboard the Glen Eyre, Westinghouse had shared the news with his crewthat they would be in charge of lighting and powering the Chicago World’s Fair,which was less than a year away. He had asked his team to design a 1,200 brakehorsepower engine that operated at 200 revolutions per minute, 150 pounds persquare inch boiler pressure, with splash lubrication. And not to be ignored, onethat had to fit in a limited amount of space.For the next twenty-four hours, McClelland and his team had designed—in sketchform—an engine that met the specifications. And to accommodate the spacelimitations, they had decided to make it a vertical engine after they had turnedthe drawing on its side while looking it over.Westinghouse’s question wasn’t so much a question; it was an imperative handedoff to his team. Rephrased, their encouraging yet demanding boss meant: “Thiswill work perfectly. Now get right to it and put four of them together withoutdelay.”* * *As the summer of 1892 continued, so too did preparations for the 1893 World’sFair. At the same time, a collection of near seven thousand workers continuedtheir efforts to transform a swampy six-hundred-acre area of Chicago into amagnificent landscape envisioned by Frederick Law Olmsted. To add to the busynature of Fair preparations, George Westinghouse was working on the challengingtask of lighting and running the exposition with alternating current.Alternating current machinery, though, wasn’t all that had to be created. No,George Westinghouse also had to prepare as if the Edison light bulb patent wasgoing to be upheld, which meant he needed to design and manufacture over 92,000bulbs that didn’t yet exist.Westinghouse wasn’t all bark when it came to his word that he had been preparingas if they’d need a completely new bulb. In fact, for the last few months he haddipped into his old patents and began work on a Sawyer-Man “stopper” light, onethat featured a two-piece design that Westinghouse felt would easilydifferentiate it from Edison’s one-piece bulb. He had purchased the patents frominventors William Sawyer and Albon Man, and he held exclusive rights tomanufacture and sell lamps that used the design. But first he had to modify thedesign to make it practical. Months of experimentation led to small successesfollowed by ultimate failures. Throughout the process, the Westinghouse teamlearned from their mistakes and continued to make progress.Toward the end of 1892, Westinghouse reached the point where the lamp wasfunctional and nearly ready to mass-produce. The design included aniron-and-glass “stopper” that was fit snugly into the glass globe, allowing itto be opened and the filament replaced once it burned out.[../images/electricwar_fig23.jpg]Two-phase alternating currentThe Edison light bulb patent was upheld on October 4, 1892, followed a monthlater by a federal court ruling that Westinghouse was no longer allowed to makeEdison-style lamps, and then punctuated by the December 15 denial to an appeal,making the litigation final. At long last, the light bulb war had been settled.But the War of the Currents waged on.For George Westinghouse, losing the light bulb ruling simply meant his “stopper”lamp had to succeed, which led to his swift decision to transform a portion ofthe Westinghouse Air Brake Company in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, into a glass andlight bulb factory fully dedicated to mass-producing the new bulbs.General Electric representatives continued their attempts at hinderingWestinghouse by filing a last-ditch restraining order that they hoped wouldprohibit the production of the Sawyer-Man “stopper” bulbs, claiming this newdesign, too, infringed on the Edison patent.Westinghouse caught wind of the restraining order and had his lawyers presentand prepared at the hearing, and the new year of 1893 brought with it a final,concluding ruling that the Sawyer-Man “stopper” patent was indeed unique, noinfringement present.The courtroom was no longer a battlefield for George Westinghouse. Now all thatremained was mass-producing over 100,000 bulbs, all the while designing and thenactually building alternating current machinery that was ten times more powerfulthan anything in existence.George Westinghouse needed help.* * *Nikola Tesla became a regular presence in the Allegheny factory at the beginningof 1893.Tesla and Westinghouse immediately settled back into their comfortablerelationship built on trust and respect, deciding that they should place “twosingle phase alternators side by side, with their armature windings staggered 90degrees,” in order to achieve Tesla’s two-phase AC design, which would soon befeatured on all Tesla induction motors. When they had completed their work, eachpiece of machinery had the capability of powering just over thirty thousand“stopper” lamps.In the January 1893 issue of Electrical Engineer, it was reported that therewere twelve nearly completed vertical generators that operated 1,000-horsepowerengines weighing seventy-five tons apiece. The article concluded that it would“constitute the largest single exhibit of operating machinery ever made at anyexposition, and probably the most extensive exhibit in the Fair.” Of course,there was still much work to be done, but the report assured Fair officials thatthe exposition was on schedule, while at the same time it infuriated GeneralElectric representatives, who had exhausted their efforts to thwartWestinghouse’s success.As insurance, Westinghouse decided that each generator would have its own backupgenerator, keeping the World’s Fair constantly powered. There would be nounexpected blackouts; Tesla and Westinghouse made sure of that. All told,everything would be powered by a massive 2,000-horsepower Allis-Chalmers engine,and everything would be fueled with oil, eliminating the smoky grime that camewith coal.Work continued from winter to spring, accompanied by glitches and hang-ups. Inthe end, most of the machinery and all the bulbs were on the Chicago fairgroundsmere weeks before opening day. They’d gotten everything delivered, but justunder the wire.Still, the task wasn’t to simply have the alternating current machinery there.The ultimate goal was to successfully light and power the Fair. Only upon doingso would George Westinghouse have a clear-cut victory in this pivotal battle.* * *May 1, 1893World’s Columbian Exposition, Chicago, IllinoisPresident Grover Cleveland, casually dressed so as to not steal all theattention on this occasion, stood firm with his hand hovering over a welcominggold-and-ivory telegraph key. Overhead, glimmering in the suddenly brightdaylight of midmorning, the golden dome of the Administration Building sentspecks and shards of sunlight in all directions, as if the golden dome weresurrounded by a radiant halo.[../images/electricwar_fig24.jpg]Map of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, considered the “World Series” ofthe AC/DC warPresident Cleveland spoke with authority, his voice capturing the many anxiousvisitors in full arrest. He paused, and the spectators housed under the radiantAdministration Building umbrella followed suit, barely a breath taken asCleveland slowly lowered his finger.As the tip of Cleveland’s index finger met the telegraph key, the silence gaveway to a loud and angelic choir who sang “Hallelujah Chorus” with energy thatspread from one onlooker to the next. A hum of excitement and wonder rippledover the audience.And like the energy that spread from the choir to the audience, the impressionof the telegraph key spread an electric charge along a long wire some hundredsof feet away to Machinery Hall, where Westinghouse engineers and workers waitedmuch like the crowd had moments before—silent, in full arrest. After all, thiswas the moment of truth.[../images/electricwar_fig25.jpg]Westinghouse dynamo in Machinery Hall, 1893 World’s Columbian ExpositionThey watched the massive Allis-Chalmers engine, collectively willing it to cometo life and ease their nerves.And it did.The 2,000-horsepower monster surged with electricity, immediately pumping powerinto the arteries of the many Westinghouse generators. Quickly, the generatorsseized this new energy and spread it through the veins of wires in alldirections around the fairgrounds.In the Court of Honor—dubbed the “White City” due to the architecture’sconsistency of white plaster and “staff” (artificial stone) all around—threefountains shot streams of water into the air, signaling to Westinghouseengineers and fairgoers alike that the Fair now had been powered up withalternating current.[../images/electricwar_fig26.jpg]1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, Court of Honor[../images/electricwar_fig27.jpg]Statue of the Republic, 1893 World’s Columbian ExpositionIn the Court of Honor and onstage at the gold-domed Administration Building, aswell as back in Machinery Hall, cheers and applause and whoops mixed together inharmony with the boat whistles, cannon fire, foghorns, and bells that moved inwaves over the Grand Basin. As flags from the many represented countriesunfurled all along the Court of Honor, the boisterous mixture of celebratorysounds came together in the middle of the Grand Basin’s giant pool of water,where the “Statue of the Republic” stood with raised hands—a globe topped with aspread-winged eagle in her right hand, a staff in her left hand, topped by alaurel-encircled plaque engraved with the word “Liberty.”Thus, despite the fact that more than a few attractions had yet to be opened tothe public, the 1893 Columbian Exposition had officially been launched by GeorgeWestinghouse. His alternating current system was now powering the entire Fair.The cold and rainy weather that had led up to opening day returned on day twoand lingered for most of that first week. This nasty weather, in conjunctionwith the delayed opening of various attractions, didn’t hurt attendance. Overthe six-month span of the entire exposition, over twenty-seven million visitorsfrom all over the world would pay the fifty-cent admission fee to see a host ofsights they’d never seen before.There was George Washington Ferris’s Wheel, 250 feet high with thirty-six cabincars spread out in equally spaced fashion. Then there was the IntramuralElevated Railway, which shuttled visitors from one place to another; the veryfirst moving sidewalk, which spanned some three thousand feet along the pier;and various machines of the Libby Glass Company. There was also the electrickitchen in Jackson Park, which showcased the many state-of-the-art devices beingintroduced to the public, and each and every one was made possible—andoperational—by Westinghouse Electric and its efficient and safe alternatingcurrent.[../images/electricwar_fig28.jpg]George Washington Ferris’s Wheel, 1893 World’s Columbian ExpositionYes, everything was given life by the system that Harold P. Brown had spent somuch time tearing down and forcing the public to see as the “executioner’scurrent.” Now, as person after person attended the Fair and saw, firsthand andup close, that this system of electricity was far from deadly, the lens throughwhich the public saw alternating current had been changed. With theuninterrupted availability and the accident- and incident-free track record asdays wore on, people began to see alternating current as a harmless, do-it-allmethod of powering the world.But George Westinghouse and his team had made sure this event was flawless, sothey weren’t surprised by their success. In fact, although he had beencommissioned for 92,000 bulbs, to make sure the lights would never go out—oreven dim in the slightest—Westinghouse had come to the table with 250,000 bulbsto use at the exposition. Daily, 180,000 bulbs found use, leaving a ratherhealthy reserve of 70,000-plus bulbs. George Westinghouse had extensivelyplanned for problems, and he had accommodated for the fact that there would beproblems. Like, for example, a multitude of burned-out bulbs. As an addedsafeguard, Westinghouse employed a team of workers whose sole job encompassedrunning around the park to deliver and change bulbs whenever necessary.And when it came to the wire and cable that fed electricity all over the park,Westinghouse and Burnham had wisely decided to bury everything in a widesubway-style tunnel system that afforded the ability to discreetly access andfix any faulty wiring. There were 1,560 manholes all around the grounds, makingit convenient to gain access just about anywhere. This underground series oftunnels also allowed the wires that the public had begun to associate withdanger to be out of sight, taking the threat and fear of live wires away frompassersby.The safety of the wire-free environment allowed fairgoers to feel at ease andunthreatened by the constant presence of electricity all around them. With thiscomfortability, visitors checked out the many items and inventions beingintroduced to the public for the first time.And there was much to be seen, as the 1893 World’s Fair held many brand-newinventions that would end up becoming staples of America’s future, including thezipper, Cracker Jack, Wrigley’s Juicy Fruit gum, spray paint, the dishwasher,and Aunt Jemima pancake mix.With all the attractions to visit, what impressed people most might have beenthe display of electric power throughout the Fair. This shouldn’t have come as asurprise, simply based on the numbers. Compared to the previous World’s Fair, in1889 in Paris, where 3,000 horsepower had been employed, the 1893 ColumbianExposition pumped out a whopping 29,000 horsepower. In fact, the Review ofReviews concluded, “The World’s Fair probably comes as near being theelectrician’s ideal city as any spot on the globe.”It was at night, though, that the Chicago World’s Fair enraptured fairgoers. Asday gave way to day and word spread, it became known that the daytime hours werenothing compared to the prime time that was sunset and nighttime. Each day asthe sun disappeared over the horizon, the brilliance of the White City mystifiedman and child alike.[../images/electricwar_fig29.jpg]The Administration Building at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, completelypowered and lit up by ACWithout fail, it’d grow silent as the sky grew dark, people waiting in earnest,staring at their surroundings. As it began, the gold-domed AdministrationBuilding lit up like a mushroom on fire, followed by the white buildings allaround the Court, which were riddled with bulbs that went off one after anotherlike silent fireworks. Thousands of bluish arc lights lined the walkways allover the grounds, while gondolas and boats in the Basin added to the lightextravaganza with bobbing, rocking bulbs that flicked on at night. Then therewas the Ferris Wheel, covered with three thousand lights, rotating slowly like agrounded moon engulfed in flames.Then, from the highest rooftops, four huge searchlights shone different-coloredlights into the black sky. Green, red, white, and blue barbs of light danced inthe air. The colors changed in uniform fashion to the delight of the audience,who oohed and ahhed. As if that wasn’t enough, every night soon after thesearchlights lit up the sky with the colorful light show, everything went darkonce again. From bright light all over to sudden …Darkness.People all around turned their attention to the darkened Basin, where theMacMonnies fountain loomed. Murmurs and whispers from the crowd could be heardas “the great electric fountains lifted their gushing and gleaming waters … oneon either side of the MacMonnies fountain, and through all their many changeseach was the counterpart of the other, alike in color and form.” Different linesand shapes and colors came together in the spraying water as people stood inawe.For the first month of operation, as new attractions slowly opened almost daily,people rushed to the Fair to pay witness to the power of the White City. Andeach night at nine thirty p.m. when the Fair closed, people left with a smile ontheir faces, eyes wide in disbelief.But it was one month into the Fair’s existence that the true draw of theexposition opened: the Electricity Building.[../images/electricwar_fig30.jpg]Electricity Building, 1893 World’s Columbian ExpositionOn June 1, 1893, amid a steady downpour, people flocked to the newly openedElectricity Building. Everyone wanted a glimpse inside this crystal ball of thetechnological future.Just outside the entrance, visitors were welcomed by an enormous statue ofBenjamin Franklin, all decked out in full colonial garb, his historic kite inhand.Inside, a three-acre exhibition hall was lit up with thirty thousand bulbs,which forced fairgoers to adjust their eyes to the brilliant display. Flags andceremonial bunting lined the second-story balcony all around the hall, thecolorful drapery catching the light in welcoming fashion.Once their eyes adjusted to the bright light, people rushed from exhibition toexhibition, each attraction even better than the one before.And though the 1893 World’s Fair was powered by George Westinghouse’salternating current, Charles Coffin had made sure the Electricity Building wasteeming with all things Edison, including an eighty-foot Columbian columncovered with hundreds of Edison light fixtures. Atop this column was aneight-foot-tall half-ton Edison bulb shining with sparkling magnificence throughsome five thousand small prisms. In rhythm and time with the music playing inthe hall, the lights changed colors and twinkled as though the column itselfwere moving and interacting with the music. A less-than-subtle jab atWestinghouse was made in the fact that the full seven-volume,seven-thousand-page record of the light bulb case was at the base of the columnfor everyone to read at their leisure.Charles Coffin and General Electric used Edison’s name to remind fairgoers ofGeneral Electric’s presence, since even though Edison’s name had been removedfrom the company’s title and banner, everyone still associated Thomas Edisonwith the GE brand.As such, Thomas Edison’s Kinetoscope was featured as well, the new inventionthat displayed the first motion pictures. On the screen of the Kinetoscope,Prime Minister William Gladstone of Great Britain delivered a speech in theHouse of Commons, forcing people to do a double take at the reality that thiswas only a recorded production and not the real thing.The main floor of the Electricity Building drew excited visitors in droves, asthe major inventors of the time were present to display their latestdiscoveries. Front and center, headlining the inventor docket was none otherthan Nikola Tesla.One display that impressed those in the electric fraternity more than theaverage person was the Tesla/Westinghouse model of the alternating currentsystem, which covered a long table. While the common man and woman walked rightpast without a glance, the electricians and inventors in attendance stopped andstudied the intricate detail spread out on the table, as if they were staring ata scene from the future through a time machine.[../images/electricwar_fig32.jpg]Tesla AC model demonstration, 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition[../images/electricwar_fig31.jpg]Electricity Building, 1893 World’s Columbian ExpositionNikola Tesla himself was a hot-ticket item. The Serbian immigrant dressed toimpress. For this show he had an ostrich-sized copper egg surrounded by an arrayof smaller copper eggs which served as planets, a simulation of the Milky Waygalaxy on display. Just as the onlookers began to nod and clap, the eccentricinventor let them know this was just the beginning.For his next act, Nikola Tesla took to a darkened room with a crackling“Westinghouse” sign lit up and pulsing with energy just outside the entryway.Thunder boomed inside the dark room as two rubber plates lined withtinfoil—about fifteen feet apart, serving as terminals—hung suspended above thegaunt inventor. When the current was turned on, empty bulbs and tubes around theroom lit up. These bulbs were not connected to wires and seemingly not connectedto the terminals, yet they were illuminated just the same. In various areas ofthe dark room, glass tubing lit up and formed the names of famous electricians,Tesla’s way of paying homage to his esteemed colleagues. Excluding ThomasEdison, of course. Amid the glowing tubes, sparks and daggers of light blanketedthe aluminum-covered surface all around the “electrified” room.These two acts became regular features at the Fair, satisfying all who witnessedthem. But what everyone really wanted to see—what they’d heard about in mythicalmanner—was how the great Nikola Tesla could pass electricity through his bodywithout being harmed. It was something he’d done in Paris years prior, and wordhad spread that he was aiming to do it again at the Fair.* * *August 25, 1893World’s Columbian Exposition, Chicago, IllinoisOver a thousand electrical engineers and scientists along with a host of commonfairgoers crammed into Assembly Hall in the Agricultural Building. Today was theday, and the hour was upon them. Nikola Tesla was about to pass 250,000 volts ofcurrent through his body.Inventor Elisha Gray stood on a platform and addressed the crowd and introducedTesla as the “Wizard of Physics,” handing over the stage to the guest of honor.Nikola Tesla addressed the eager onlookers. He was standing on a platformwearing a tailored four-button brown suit. To his sides were small cylinders ofheavy steel mounted on steel pedestals, each held up by an insulated woodenbase. A wooden table was to one side of Tesla, small electrical appliancesstacked and piled up high.Tesla joked about his frail frame and informed the audience he was about tolecture on “Mechanical and Electrical Oscillators.” He detailed the fact thatoscillators could transmit information or electric energy and he could createpulsations through objects of various kinds. He then explained that he haddesigned steam generators that were so small he could fit them in a derby hat.Then talk gave way to action. Tesla knew it was time to mystify the audience.Without delay, Tesla made objects light up, spark, and seemingly glow withelectric flame, and he lit up protofluorescent lights of varying sizes andshapes. The crowd watched with delight.With a flourish, Tesla engulfed himself in a pool of pulsating light that passedin waves around his body. Tesla was surrounded by a storm of white flame. Thecurrent of light subsided and Tesla stood for the successive minutes amid a haloof sparking light that seemed to cling to his brown suit.What the public didn’t quite understand was that Nikola Tesla was never reallyin danger. He understood the science of electricity, and this knowledge is whatkept him safe. The alternating current that flowed from the oscillator didn’tpass through his body but instead traveled around the outside of his gauntframe. Though it looked like electricity was slicing through Tesla, in realitythis high-voltage current was moving along the surface of his skin and hispristine brown suit. His internal organs, like his heart and lungs, wereprotected by the science that Nikola Tesla understood completely.After the final sparks danced on the floor like grease on a frying pan,everything stopped. No one moved as that final spark disappeared.At once, the audience hopped to their feet and let loose in applause. NikolaTesla bowed gracefully and grinned. The stage was his, and he owned it.And while Tesla owned the moment, when the Fair closed shop on October 30,George Westinghouse owned the War of the Currents.Despite their profit of just under twenty thousand dollars, the six months ofpublicity for alternating current and Westinghouse Electric was priceless. Priorto the exhibition, alternating current had been a stranger to the averagecitizen, linked to death and danger more than anything else. Now, as the faircame to an end, both alternating current and Westinghouse Electric were welcomedby mainstream society, like trusted friends. George Westinghouse and alternatingcurrent had won over the public. Completely."},{"pageContent":" 16 ONE RISES, ONE FALLS [contents.xhtml#c_ch16]The 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition was a major victory for Westinghouse,Tesla, and alternating current, but a war isn’t over until one side eithersurrenders or is no longer standing. Direct current and General Electric—withThomas Edison barely in the fold—still had their legs beneath them. True,General Electric and direct current might have been wobbly and wounded, but theyhad some fight left.Fittingly, the final round of the vicious war of electricity would be foughtstraddling a line. But unlike most of the battles of the War of the Currents,which had tilted one way or the other on a line separating the ethical from theunethical, this final showdown would take place on a geographical line betweenthe US and Canada: Niagara Falls.That same natural marvel that had captured a teenage Nikola Tesla upon readingabout it and seeing breathtaking images in books was now the setting of theclimactic battle in the epic war. That “flash of light” of a giant wheel beingturned continually by the powerful water had dominated his mind from adolescenceto adulthood. And that vow he had made to his uncle to make that vision areality was now in focus. It was a chance to make his dream come true.This battle had actually started years before, in 1886, when ThomasEvershed—Erie Canal engineer—had a magnificent idea after learning of theNiagara Reservation, which was a series of mandates and restrictions passed bythe New York State government forbidding any and all man-made waterways on itsfour-hundred-acre plot of state land. Evershed’s mind had focused on therestrictions—the sacred and protected four-hundred-acre limit—and this triggeredhis idea: the Niagara Project, a plan to capture the natural power of the fallsby creating a canal waterwheel power system set up a mile above the falls,keeping it beyond the restricted area.In sum, his plan was to redirect Niagara River water into a canal that wouldfeed into a complex mill of two hundred waterwheels. After working its way fromthe river to the canal and through the wheels, the water would be sent down along tailrace tunnel far underground beneath the town of Niagara. This usefulwater that’d set the wheels in perpetual motion would travel through thetailrace and then reenter the Niagara downriver of the falls.But in order for it to be successful, the Niagara Project would require vastsums of money. In fact, some would joke—although it might not have been much ofan exaggeration—the amount of capital needed for the project far exceeded theenormity of the Niagara Cataract itself.Thomas Evershed did not possess the funds needed to see his plan through, so heformed a team to help round up investors. From the outset, the Evershed grouphad trouble finding moneymen who could actually come through with the fundsneeded. To help their cause, they enlisted the help of William Rankine, New Yorkattorney and friend to many prominent businessmen.Rankine immediately tempted investors, but the first few balked at actuallyputting up the capital needed. Enlisting the resilient and relentless Rankinepaid off for the Evershed group, literally, when he landed none other than J. P.Morgan to contribute to the project. This was the same investor who had frontedmany leading companies and businesses, including Thomas Edison and GeneralElectric. He was the top dog of investors, and when he got involved that usuallymeant others followed his lead.It was Morgan who helped point Rankine and the Evershed group toward the manwho’d end up taking over the planning and implementation of the project, a NewYork investment banker named Edward Dean Adams.When first approached by Rankine, Morgan initially indicated he had greatconfidence in the prospects of the project, only to decline after meeting withRankine in person. Rankine was confused. Not wanting to lose this financialpowerhouse who could make the Niagara Project a reality, he asked Morgan what hecould do to turn that initial interest and confidence into a commitment. Morganmentioned that he liked the plan and the details but claimed they didn’t haveanyone in place to run it. When Rankine asked for his opinion on the matter,Morgan flatly said that if they could convince Edward Dean Adams to head theproject, he’d be convinced enough to invest. At the tail end of 1889, Adamsaccepted the position, and Morgan put his money where his mouth was, and another102 wealthy, respected investors also put up $2,630,000 to officially create theCataract Construction Company.To help him plan and construct the entire operation, Adams brought aboardColeman Sellers, an experienced and respected mechanical engineer fromPhiladelphia. Additionally, Adams enlisted the services of Scottishmathematician Sir William Thomson to head the newly formed International NiagaraCommission, charged with the task of determining the best and most efficient wayto utilize the power of the falls.While the use of a long underground tailrace was quickly decided uponunanimously, members of the commission debated internally over how, exactly,they should use the falls to fully realize its most effective power potential.Much like the electric fraternity itself, there was a split between which systemwould work best: direct or alternating current.In the early fall of 1890, Thomson and the International Niagara Commissioninvited engineers from around the world to submit packaged solution plans forthe best way to harness Niagara’s energy. They advertised that they’d award“prizes” for proposals, the highest amount being three thousand dollars.Fourteen proposals later—with George Westinghouse adamantly refusing to supply“free” information without any true motivation—the commission continued to weighthe options while the physical construction got started.Beginning with the tailrace, ground was broken on October 4, 1890, as 1,300 menmade use of dynamite to dent the ground, pickaxes and sledgehammers to chip andbreak it up, and mules to trudge shards of rock and gravel to wagons thatwheeled away unwanted debris from the tailrace site. Work continued around theclock day in and day out. Adams and Sellers adjusted their plans a few monthsinto the project, shortening the tailrace from the originally determinedtwo-and-a-half-mile length to just over one mile (6,800 feet).In December 1891, Adams and Sellers had narrowed down their prospects and askedfor detailed bids from six respected electric companies, includingThomson-Houston, Edison General Electric, and Westinghouse Electric. Based onthe initial proposals, which Westinghouse had called “free information,” thecommission now knew what they wanted: ten 5,000-horsepower turbines to placedeep in two central stations, each of which would run an electric generator,resulting in a combined 100,000-horsepower payload. The scale of the project waswell beyond anything in existence. Each of the six electric companies Adams andSellers had solicited bids from began to put together an elaborate plan to besubmitted sometime in the next year.In the meantime, Adams and Rankine purchased two miles of land along the NiagaraRiver, 1,500 acres to be used for dozens of factories, along with a plot of landto develop a small town for workers, called Echota, designed by renownedarchitect Stanford White.Tailrace construction marched on for two years until December 20, 1892, whenwork finally came to an end. The result was the creation of the largest watertunnel in the world, complete with six hundred thousand tons of excavated rockand sixteen million bricks lining the tunnel to fortify its framework.Unfortunately, twenty-eight men had lost their lives in the process.During the construction of the tailrace, another hydropower project had beentaking place in the San Juan Mountains of Telluride, Colorado. The strugglingGold King Mine had decided it needed cheap energy, leading them to contactWestinghouse Electric about a single-phase alternator that could harness powerfrom the 320-foot waterfall in the area. A Tesla single-phase alternator andseven hundred dollars’ worth of copper wire spread over three miles of roughterrain helped the Gold King Mine capture three thousand volts of electricity,without a glitch, for the entire year in 1892. George Westinghouse knew thisGold King Mine success would help his position, and he told Adams in the fall of1892 that he would be submitting a bid. Westinghouse also knew that the successor failure of the World’s Fair would be watched closely by Adams and Sellers.In December 1892, Westinghouse formally offered a fully detailed two-phase ACsystem to the Cataract Construction Company. Less than a month later, GeneralElectric came through with its own offer, strikingly similar to the Westinghouseplan, with the only noticeable difference being the fact that GE’s proposalinvolved a three-phase alternating current system.Thomas Edison’s absence as a major shareholder and creative force of GeneralElectric worked against the company’s proposal, along with GE’s inexperiencewith a proven and functional large-scale AC system. GE was fighting againstgreat odds.When Adams and Sellers had the proposals in hand—four total—they began to revieweach plan and undertake experiments to test the validity of their claims. OnJanuary 9, 1893, Sellers and Johns Hopkins professor Henry Rowland ran tests onWestinghouse’s alternating current generators and transformers.Rowland praised the workmanship of the Westinghouse machinery, the company’svast knowledge of alternating current, and the fact that Westinghouse and NikolaTesla owned all the critical AC patents.Coleman Sellers, after visiting a General Electric plant to test theirthree-phase system, concluded, “I should incline to the biphase on account ofits greater simplicity and its adaptability to a broader field of usefulness.”After running tests on all the other proposals, Adams began to discreetlycorrespond with the electrical genius who knew alternating current like noother: Nikola Tesla. In his letters to Adams, Tesla made it clear that hisownership of almost every critical AC patent could not be overlooked ordevalued. In no uncertain terms, Tesla explained that Westinghouse’s proposalcould not be ignored, prompting Sellers to conclude in his twenty-five-pagereport, “I am not aware of any claim to ownership in this country of what canstop the owners of the Tesla patents from commanding the market.… no foreigncompany can secure the Cataract Construction Co. against all losses from patentlitigation.”In early May 1893, with the opening of the Fair dominating George Westinghouse’sattention, he learned that his company’s blueprints and documents about theprices, labor costs, and details of both the World’s Fair and the Niagara planshad been stolen. Westinghouse immediately sought and was granted a warrant,which led to the discovery that a Westinghouse draftsman had sold the plans toGeneral Electric for thousands of dollars. The draftsman was arrested andGeneral Electric was soon found guilty, though GE representatives claimed theyhad only been trying to see if Westinghouse had infringed on their plans.On May 8, the Pittsburgh district attorney announced conspiracy charges alongwith his intent to seek a grand jury indictment of General Electric, includingthe directly named Charles Coffin. A defensive Coffin adamantly denied anyinvolvement in the crime, and in the end he was removed as a defendant, and thePittsburgh jury found themselves deadlocked.Then, on May 11—less than two weeks into the World’s Fair—Adams and the CataractConstruction Company shocked all four of the electric companies who hadsubmitted plans. In a generic form letter, Adams informed all four companiesthat their services were no longer needed, as they had appointed their ownelectric consultant, Professor George Forbes, who was set to design a generatorto power their 5,000-horsepower water turbines.With the World’s Fair in full blossom, George Westinghouse did not have time todirectly approach Adams and Sellers about this extreme and abrupt about-face.Instead, Westinghouse kept the Fair in focus for most of the summer of 1893,while Forbes spent the same time working on the Cataract dynamo design.On August 10, 1893, Coleman Sellers, who had been named president of the NiagaraFalls Power Company, announced that Professor Forbes had designed a dynamo andtransformer that would be used for the plant. In a déjà vu move, Sellers and theCataract Company once again invited interested electric companies to bid on thecontract to manufacture and install its generating machinery.On August 21, mentioning that he needed to see what Forbes had produced beforecomposing a practical proposal, Westinghouse sent one of his top engineers,Lewis Stillwell, to Niagara to tour and inspect the Forbes designs. It tooklittle time for Stillwell to conclude that Forbes’s designs were so helplesslyflawed that he could not see any feasible way his company, or any company, couldconstruct the machinery. It simply wasn’t realistically practical.As Westinghouse and his team reviewed the Forbes blueprints that Stillwell hadbrought back to Pittsburgh, Westinghouse immediately relayed the news to theCataract Company that “mechanically the proposed generators embodied goodideas,” opting to apply a thick coat of generous professionalism to hisstatement, but “electrically it was defective and if built as designed,” heflatly explained, they “would not operate.” Westinghouse added that the lowfrequency Forbes had planned would force lights to flicker and flash on and off,and the power was far too low to run a host of other electric devices it wouldneed to run. He summed up his report with the reality that the hyper-elevated22,000 voltage was far too high, and insulation issues would surface, resultingin an unsolvable problem.Coleman Sellers and Edward Dean Adams received the Westinghouse report as if ablaring alarm had just sounded, one that was unable to be shut off. It was clearto Adams and Sellers that they needed the expertise and the full breadth ofknowledge—not to mention the patents—that only Westinghouse Electric &Manufacturing could offer. If the detailed report wasn’t evidence enough thatthey were making a mistake, the success of Westinghouse’s alternating current atthe World’s Fair served as a clincher.So it was that three days before the World’s Fair closed, on October 27, 1893,George Westinghouse finalized an agreement—complete with a signed contract—totake charge of the Niagara Project. The War of the Currents had been won. Thefinal blow had been struck, and alternating current and George Westinghouse werethe last combatant left standing.This also meant that Tesla’s teenage vision of using Niagara Falls to generatepower was about to come true. Nikola Tesla had done it. He’d lost countlessdollars by tearing up his royalty contract, but he knew that without doing so hewould never have seen his work achieve its full potential. Finally, the Serbianimmigrant had realized his American dream.* * *The year 1894 was a busy one for Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing. Therewas no more competition in the electric battle; the only fight was the internalbattle to perfect the machinery and the alternating current system that’d beutilized at Niagara Falls.Professor Forbes was “let go” by the Niagara Falls Power Company whenWestinghouse made it clear that he and his engineers held no confidence in theman’s work. Without Forbes, the Westinghouse team built the first two5,000-horsepower generators, which were five times more powerful than thegenerators employed at the Fair. This was completely new territory to travel,but Westinghouse and his crew found their way; they were up to the challenge.Finally, on August 26, 1895, the first Niagara dynamo came to life at AdamsPower Plant in Niagara Falls. Soon after, the second dynamo started up and sentelectricity to the first commercial customer, the Pittsburgh Reduction Plant.While there had been difficulties determining the best system to use leading upto August 1893, as well as many obstacles to overcome during 1894 while the teamworked to perfect the machinery and its operation, the first month of operationheld nothing but success. Everything was proceeding as the electric experts hadhoped.Cataract Construction Company president Edward Dean Adams decided it was time toshow off his plant to some esteemed visitors. After all, there was money to bemade. Why not impress a who’s who of the investment world while things wererunning so smoothly?September 30, 1895, might have been the day when the greatest collection ofwealth was in one place at the same time. That’s the day Adams hosted theall-star cast of characters who made up the Cataract Construction Company Boardof Directors. With Edward Dean Adams included, the board featured the likes ofJohn Jacob Astor, New York real estate mogul, investor, and inventor, along withseven more of the most celebrated moneymen in the country. These well-dressed,bowler-hat-wearing, cigar-smoking men visited Adams Power Plant and were thefirst people to receive a guided tour of the astonishing complex.Over time, others would be welcomed at the Niagara operation with open arms,witnessing the combined power of the falls and electricity. Inventors,scientists, electrical engineers, celebrities—everyone who visited leftimpressed, often to the point of waxing poetically about the awesome spectacle.Stories, poems, and songs were written about the special place in between twocountries.[../images/electricwar_fig33.jpg]Adams Power Plant, a symbol of a Westinghouse victory for ACBut one man refused to visit, despite many invitations. The inventor ofalternating current himself: Nikola Tesla. From as early as 1892, Tesla had beeninvited—often begged—to visit Niagara Falls and the plant he had helped inspire.Why did he choose to turn down the invitations? He’d never overtly answer thisquestion, but perhaps his refusal to visit the awe-inspiring natural wonder hadsomething to do with holding on to those out-of-reach dreams of his. For Tesla,it’s possible he preferred to keep Niagara in his dreams, so as to not let it becorrupted by reality’s unflinching indifference to human fantasies.* * *July 19, 1896Niagara Falls, New YorkTesla had been able to put this off for over five years. The offers had beenkind, and the hosts’ flexibility and generosity in accommodating any of hisdesires had been more than anyone could expect. Still, he’d managed to stayaway.Until now.Nikola Tesla stepped off the Glen Eyre and shook his head at the display beforehim. His old friend and colleague George Westinghouse was by his side, alongwith a few other friendly faces, like William Rankine, Edward Dean Adams,Westinghouse attorney and friend Paul Cravath, and thirteen-year-old GeorgeWestinghouse III. They were all talking to each other in separate conversations,everyone leaning close to the next person, almost shouting into a welcoming ear.Nikola had no idea what they were saying to one another. The moaning current andthunderous crashing torrent of water over the sides of the cataract made itimpossible to hear anything else. He didn’t mind. In fact, as he stepped closerto the falls he was thankful that the roaring water drowned out all othernoises. This was just as he’d imagined. He stared, debating whether this wasreality or one of his flashes of light. Perhaps it was both?Something pressed down on his shoulder, forcing Tesla to turn and see WilliamRankine, who smiled and nodded. Edward Dean Adams turned around and gestured foreveryone to follow.Soon after, the group approached an imposing limestone building that appeared tobe covered with windows.“Power House Number 1,” said Adams as he stopped at the door.Nikola Tesla looked at the building, designed by Stanford White, and paused. Didhe really want to see what was inside? Or did he want to keep it as it was inhis mind?Tesla entered the building holding his breath. It took only a few moments forthe man to exhale, thankful that he’d decided to come inside. Tesla strolledalong the specially designed walkways beside the dynamo and closely inspectedwhat he considered a work of art. This wasn’t machinery; it was the Mona Lisa.He asked questions of Adams and nodded time and time again, recognizing themasterful construction of the powerful machine. They’d done a fine job.The group was led down to the ground floor to take a look at the otheralternating current machinery before taking a fancy elevator down to the wheelpits, where they heard the water rushing through the penstock pipes, along withthe shifting water turbines moving with great force.After visiting the transformer building across the other side of thecanal—traveling over a limestone bridge—William Rankine escorted the group tothe Cataract Hotel, which overlooked the American side of the falls.They treated themselves to an early lunch, with various members of the pressdying to talk to the honored guests, Nikola Tesla the recipient of most of thequestions.“It is all and more than I anticipated it would be,” said Tesla about the plant.Reflecting on the operation he had witnessed that day, Tesla added that “theplant and the prospect of future development in electrical science, and the moreordinary uses of electricity, are my ideals. They are what I have longanticipated and have labored, in an insignificant way, to contribute towardbringing about.”The reporters asked in disbelief if it was true that this was Tesla’s first timeat Niagara Falls and the plant. “Yes, I came purposely to see it. But, and it isa curious thing about me, I cannot stay about big machinery a great while.”* * *January 12, 1897, 10:25 p.m.Ellicott Club, Buffalo, New YorkIt had been a long day for Nikola Tesla. He’d agreed to be the guest of honor atthis formal dinner after Edward Dean Adams had first told him that he wanted tocelebrate a monumental achievement: the successful effort to use Niagara Fallsto power Buffalo, New York, since November 15 of the previous year.But what Tesla assumed would be a quick stop at Niagara Falls followed by adinner party where he’d mingle for a bit, say a few words, and then retireactually turned out to be a nonstop morning-to-late-night extravaganza oftraveling and sightseeing.They’d arrived at nine a.m. in Niagara Falls, where they were treated tobreakfast at the Prospect House Hotel. From there, they’d visited Power HouseNo. 1 once again, followed by a factory-after-factory visit of businessespowered by Niagara.After visiting Niagara Falls, they were taken by private train to Buffalo forthe celebratory dinner.After hours of eating and drinking and cigar smoking and talking, Nikola Teslastood up to address the eager crowd. Hundreds of the most celebrated names inthe country waited with bated, cigar-tainted breath for the electrical genius toshare his thoughts.Tesla pursed his thin lips and took a deep breath through his nose. His darkeyes met the crowd as he modestly opened by admitting that he felt as if hewasn’t worthy of the honor they’d bestowed upon him. The crowd relented andshook their heads. Then they turned silent, waiting for more.Tesla urged everyone to allow their actions to be dictated not just by materialmotivation—which he admitted was an unavoidable force in the will of men—but“for the sake of success, for the pleasure there is in achieving it and for thegood they might do thereby to their fellow men.”The crowd applauded for Tesla’s fresh perspective. It was genuine, they knew,and not the contrived, affectatious front the rest put on like a glamorous gownmeant to hypnotize the senses from anything else. Those who knew Tesla knew hisinventive passion was driven by his desire to better society. This wasn’t justan ideal for Tesla; it was his primary motivation. After all, this man had givenup a pool of royalty riches.Nikola Tesla paused. He stared blankly, as if he was seeing a flash oflight—something that wasn’t really there. Then he looked around at thecollection of prominent men with that same blank stare and asked for each andevery one of them to be “men whose chief aim and enjoyment is the acquisitionand spread of knowledge, men who look far above earthly things, whose banner isExcelsior!”"},{"pageContent":" EPILOGUE: AFTER THE STORM [contents.xhtml#c_epi]The Niagara Falls victory marked the end of the War of the Currents. Alternatingcurrent and the Westinghouse-Tesla camp reigned supreme. As is the case with allwars, the effects lingered long after the fighting had stopped.Almost a decade after it had ended, a gruesome incident occurred that mirroredthe tactics Edison had employed during the electric war. Topsy the elephant wasa veteran performer at Forepaugh’s Circus and had developed a reputation as a“bad” or “wild” elephant after killing a spectator in 1902. She was sold to SeaLion Park, which soon became Luna Park, on Coney Island. At Luna Park, Topsy wasinvolved in a series of public incidents of erratic behavior, leading Luna Parkowners Frederick Thompson and Elmer Dundy to plan a public execution, at firstattempting to charge people admission to witness the killing.On January 4, 1903, Topsy was strangled, poisoned, and electrocuted withalternating current, the creature’s death ultimately resulting from theelectrocution. With Edison Manufacturing cameras capturing the execution onfilm, later played on Edison Kinetoscopes, over the years some casual observersof the video inaccurately attributed the Topsy killing as a product of the Warof the Currents. This, however, is not true, as the incident happened far afterthe back-and-forth battle had ceased, and Thomas Edison was not known to be inattendance at Luna Park on that day. The horrific Topsy execution, though, doessymbolize the lingering effects of the hard-fought war in the years thatfollowed.After the electric war had concluded, Niagara continued to fortify its arsenalof generators, and by the first few years of the twentieth century a fifth ofthe country’s electricity was supplied by Niagara, the natural marvel turnedscientific breakthrough.As each decade handed off the present tense to the next, electricity in aresidential sense grew, spreading across the nation at a steady pace. The mainreason for this slow growth was the fact that the cost of electricity was toohigh for the average citizen.[../images/electricwar_fig34.jpg]Topsy the elephant is electrocuted in public at Luna ParkOn a commercial scale, electricity fostered massive profits by way of increasedproductivity. Factories produced more and more goods, which allowed eagerconsumers to add to their quality of living. Thus, the first few decades of thetwentieth century included a gradual increase in the average person’s standardof living. Society was prospering, and so were businesses.Nearly every aspect of business, and society in general, utilizedelectricity—alternating current electricity. Like water dropping into theNiagara cataract, money poured into the bank accounts of electric companies whosold alternating current. The fight to dominate the electric world was, withoutmuch hyperbole, a fight to run the future world. These visionaries—Westinghouse,Tesla, and Edison—had the foresight to understand what would result from winningthe war. In turn, their vigor to win made their actions more and more vicious.For this wasn’t just a temporary competition; it was a battle that wouldcontinue to pay off for whomever came out victorious.Except for Nikola Tesla, that is.* * *The Serbian wizard of electricity would not rake in that money hand over fistlike many of the others involved in the War of the Currents. Tesla couldn’t havebeen surprised by this, since he had ripped up his royalty rights that wouldhave served as an endless supply of income. It was a sacrifice that cost hisbank account dearly, leaving him penniless during the final years of his life,but it was also a sacrifice that allowed alternating current to achieve itsultimate potential.[../images/electricwar_fig35.jpg]Tesla gives a demonstration of wireless power transmission, Columbia College,New York, New YorkTesla lectured on a regular basis and was a sought-after speaker. He continuedto push his creative, inventive ideas, but many people found his post-ACconcepts odd. One of Tesla’s obsessions materialized in 1901 when he beganbuilding the Wardenclyffe Tower in Shoreham, Long Island. This massive structurewas 187 feet high, with a large dome made of conductive copper mesh topping theedifice. Underground, the shaft of the tower pushed down into the earth over ahundred feet, with iron piping stabbing down another three hundred feet. Teslaaimed to use Wardenclyffe as a wireless transmission station, intending to sendmessages across the Atlantic Ocean to England, in order “to telephone, to sendthe human voice and likeness around the globe.” But in true Tesla form, he gotcaught up in his own mind, and he soon envisioned the transmission of wirelesspower overseas. According to Tesla himself, the tower was “adequate for thetransmission of virtually any amount of energy.”Tesla’s grand scheme required more money than he could secure. Constructiondragged on and costs piled up. To make matters worse, Tesla’s past caught upwith him when his old debts with the Waldorf-Astoria came back to haunt him. Inarrears to the tune of twenty thousand dollars, Tesla gave two mortgages onWardenclyffe to George C. Boldt, manager of the Waldorf-Astoria. Unfortunately,Tesla couldn’t manage to make any payments, and he soon lost possession ofWardenclyffe to Boldt. Before the strange tower could ever be used, Boldtdecided there was more value in the destruction of the tower, so in July 1917 hehad Wardenclyffe demolished and the steel sold for scrap.[../images/electricwar_fig36.jpg]Wardenclyffe TowerTesla found himself obsessed with the concept of the wireless transmission ofenergy, and specifically, another breakthrough technological device: the radio.As was the pattern for Tesla, the failure to secure a patent or gain public orfinancial backing while he was experimenting and, most say, inventing the radio,left him off the patent ledger as the inventor of the radio, at least while hewas alive.Instead, Guglielmo Marconi would receive initial credit for the radio.Ultimately, Nikola Tesla’s public image would be that of an “also-ran” in hismany scientific and inventive battles. Even his victories occurred too late forhim to enjoy them, as evidenced when the Supreme Court ruled that Tesla was thetrue inventor of the radio … the same year of his death (1943).Tesla became an American citizen in 1891, a proud moment for the Serbianimmigrant. In fact, with all the acclaim and respect he’d earned as an inventorand scientist, Tesla often said he found his citizenship to be his mostcherished accomplishment. He valued being an American citizen over any otherdistinction he’d received.One honor Tesla did receive in 1916 was, ironically, the Edison Medal, whichsignified “meritorious achievements in electrical science and art.”Nikola Tesla worked alone for much of his life after the alternating currentvictory, with paid assistants as his primary human companionship for the activeyears of his life. George Westinghouse remained a business friend, but no onecould ever get close enough to Tesla to be called a true friend, not evenWestinghouse.During the later years of his life, Nikola Tesla finally found his closest andmost passionate life partners: pigeons. He’d routinely feed and talk to pigeons,especially outside the New York Public Library. Sometimes he’d sneak ailing orweak pigeons into his hotel room and nurse them back to health. Tesla nevermarried, but—odd as it might seem—one pigeon in particular filled that role. Inthe twilight of his life, Tesla described this pigeon by saying, “Yes, I lovedher as a man loves a woman, and she loved me … When that pigeon died, somethingwent out of my life … I knew my life’s work was finished.”Penniless and a relative mystery to the average American, Nikola Tesla diedalone in his thirty-third-floor hotel room at the Hotel New Yorker on January 7,1943. He was eighty-six years old.Upon his death, the US government—before his nephew Sava Kosanovic could securehis uncle’s belongings—confiscated many of Tesla’s scientific documents and hisprivate black notebook, claiming there was an imminent threat due to the factthat the inventor had claimed he’d created a “death beam” prior to his passing.It was not until 1952 that Kosanovic would receive his uncle’s papers. Much hasbeen theorized about the papers and what the government did with the knowledgecontained in them, but no claim has ever been substantiated. To this day,conspiracy theories abound in relation to the Tesla papers. Just what did thosesecret papers detail? It remains yet another Tesla mystery.* * *George Westinghouse, like a steady railcar, continued to find success inbusiness and invention, highlighted by the gas shock absorber, which helped makea car ride safe and smooth. Always with an eye on the future, not dwelling onpast accomplishments or failures, Westinghouse continued to produce a new patentonce every six weeks, culminating in some four hundred patents by the time ofhis death.[../images/electricwar_fig38.jpg]Nikola Tesla, caught up in his studies, sits in front of his Tesla coiltransformer.With the stock market crash of 1907, Westinghouse eventually lost control ofWestinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company and the Westinghouse MachineCompany. Up to that point, Westinghouse had continued to invest the bulk of histime in his many business ventures. Yet he never lost sight of something farmore important to him than business: the people he employed and his family.Through it all—business successes and failures—Westinghouse and his wiferemained happily married and close to each other, along with their son.Westinghouse’s piece work and incentivized stipends led other companies to dothe same, and his promise to give Saturdays and Sundays off helped contribute tothe traditional work-free weekend for most American companies.Revered by his employees, those in the business community, and those in theelectric fraternity, Westinghouse was awarded the Edison Medal in 1912 for“meritorious achievements in the development of the alternating current system.”Awards didn’t mean as much to Westinghouse as did the purpose of his work. Hesummed up what success and professional achievement meant to him when he said,“If some day they say of me that with my work I have contributed something tothe welfare and happiness of my fellow man, I shall be satisfied.” Indeed,Westinghouse had every right to feel satisfied.George Westinghouse died on March 12, 1914, and a large segment of thepopulation mourned a great loss.* * *While Westinghouse and Tesla had gained a clear victory in the AC/DC feud,Thomas Edison would be the ultimate winner in the public’s retrospectiveviewfinder, going down in history as the father of invention and the starinventor of the Gilded Age.Edison greatly prospered in life, even after the direct current defeat,inventing and patenting a seemingly endless list of items still used today (inall, he held 1,093 US patents at the time of his death), which include themotion picture recorder and viewer (the Kinetograph/Kinetoscope) and thealkaline storage battery. He also dabbled in concrete and iron ore, withrelative success in both ventures.[../images/electricwar_fig39.jpg]An Edison Kinetoscope—used for playback, often in Kinetoscope parlorsThanks to the Kinetoscope and the phonograph, Edison essentially established asubstantial and profitable entertainment industry. He ran his own moviestudio—the Black Maria—where he produced a number of silent pictures, leading upto The Great Train Robbery (1904), which marked the first time a film followed anarrative structure about a real event. This success led to the birth of the“movie theater” and ultimately the long-lasting impact of Edison’s work includedthe launch of both the entertainment and movie industries.Over time, Edison has been revered as the pioneer of the industrial surge in thelate nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and rightly so, based on hisentire body of work. Long after his death on October 18, 1931, he would bestudied in classrooms and cherished in the country he’d helped advance in manyways. Due to the light bulb, the phonograph, the movie camera, and the inventionprocess itself, Thomas Edison became a national hero for his accomplishments.As such, the viciousness with which he fought against Westinghouse and Tesla waspushed between the lines of the history books, hidden as people learned of theWizard of Menlo Park as only a genius of invention. Appropriate for the GildedAge itself, Edison’s exterior shine and sparkle hid the interior corruption thatcame with his victory-at-any-cost mode during the War of the Currents."},{"pageContent":" THE ELECTRIC WAR A TIMELINE [contents.xhtml#c_the]• OCTOBER 6, 1846: George Westinghouse Jr. is born in Schoharie, NY.• FEBRUARY 11, 1847: Thomas Alva Edison is born in Milan, OH.• JULY 10, 1856: Nikola Tesla is born in Smiljan, Croatia.• 1859–1863: Edison works as a newsboy, selling papers all along the Michiganrailway.• 1862: Edison creates the Weekly Herald, a small publication that featureslocal news and gossip.

Such is the case with a writer. An author mighthave the knowledge and skill to tell a story, but to actually create a book, awide assortment of people are needed. This said, I have a number of people toacknowledge who helped me craft this book.I’d like to thank Brianne Johnson for urging me to write narrative nonfiction,which was not on my radar until she mentioned it. Bri considered my writingstyle, knowledge base, and platform, and then posed the idea to me. I’ve runwith it ever since and haven’t looked back. Thank you, Bri.Thanks as always to my best writing buddy Tracy Edward Wymer for always beingthere, as a critique partner and as a friend.A big thank-you to Miss Jenny Burke at the Community Library of Dewitt andJamesville for rounding up a ton of books for my research. Sure, it took me afew hand trucks and forklifts to transport all the books, but without them thisbook wouldn’t exist.My editor, Christy Ottaviano, and her whole team deserve a great deal of thanksfor seeing the potential in a couple of books about the Gilded Age. It took adetailed proposal and a sizable chunk of this book to get Christy to sign me on,and for that I am forever grateful. Christy, I hope you are proud of the work wehave done, and the final product on these pages. Here’s to all our futureprojects together as well! A specific thank-you to Jessica Anderson for all shehas done along the way, and to my amazing copy editor, Bethany Reis, for themassive effort she put into this book. Bethany, what you did was nothing shortof magic. You are a very talented editor.Finally, my family is my lifeline, made up of my wife, Shelby; my children, A.J.and Savannah; my mother, Gerrie; my stepfather, Garry; my brothers, Jeff andTim; and my collection of nieces and nephews. All of you have been there for meas I put this book together, so thanks for all you’ve done to help me. Thanks,also, to my mother-in-law, Lydia, and all the Staffords for their love andsupport. Finally, my father told me long ago, during a difficult conversation,that maybe one day I’d write a book. He certainly was right about that."},{"pageContent":" BIBLIOGRAPHY [contents.xhtml#c_bib]“Adam, Meldrum & Anderson, a Brilliant Illumination.” Buffalo CommercialAdvertiser, November 27, 1886.Adams, Edward Dean.
