SMITH, PHDAuthor, Reading the Enemy’s Mind: Inside Star Gate–America’s Psychic EspionageProgram and The Essential Guide to Remote Viewing: The Secret Military RemotePerception Skill Anyone Can Learn.Spirit PhoneWe humans are an odd bunch. We are willing to believe only what we want to, anddisbelieve what we will—even in the face of compelling evidence to the contrary.As the authority of religion erodes in our modern era, scientists ironicallyhave by default become society’s presumptive standard-setters in matters oftruth and fact. Yet when it comes to matters outside of their comfort zone, theyoften score no higher on the objectivity meter than the average scientificallyilliterate person.This is typical of human psychology—merely being a scientist gives you noimmunity. We part only reluctantly with our cherished beliefs, comfortablephilosophies, or well-worn ways of doing or looking at things in the world. Suchwas the case with the final disposition of Thomas Edison’s “Spirit Telephone.”The story that here unfolds is one of genius, drama, inspiration, insight, andsingle-minded drive. Yet it is all about one man. If the term “larger-than-life”wasn’t coined for Thomas Edison, it should have been.Joel Martin and Bill Birnes have wisely chosen in this book to give us theframework first, to help us understand the man who was the author of thisremarkable invention. It is a story worth hearing—not just for its drama, butfor its inspiring qualities—and because so few of us these days know Edison’ssaga. We learn of his early precociousness, his missteps, his family milieu. Butwe also see the promise of the budding engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur—aninnovator who was not just the harbinger of a new age, but its creator as well.Any one of Edison’s inventions would have been an epochal achievement, yet hehad many. We learn of his idiosyncrasies, and his sometimes mean-spiritedness.But we learn more significantly of his admirable qualities—a man with trulyastounding vision and insight, with an ability to not just overcome failure, butto integrate it into his creative process—embracing failure as a necessaryprecursor to progress.As this book makes clear, Edison led humanity kicking and screaming from oneworld-changing technological revolution to the next. The battle was alwaysuphill, and he always came away the victor—except, that is, for his last fight,his spirit telephone.The idea and theory behind this unique communication device were every bit asingenious as anything else Edison invented. Much of the charm and fascination ofthis book is the journey on which the authors invite us as they follow theirsleuthing path to its conclusion. That detective work was not easy, by the way,since much (though thankfully not all) of the evidence for the device wasapparently intentionally suppressed after Edison’s passing.It was as if, after all the brilliant accomplishments and the genius of hisinventions, science finally said to Edison, “Communicating with spirits? Nowyou’ve gone too far.” Such is typical of an attitude that seems inextricablyembedded in the mindset of modern science. It is fine to let your imaginationroam, explore phenomena at will, delve into the secrets of nature whether smallor great—but only up to a point. There are boundaries beyond which scienceforbids its researchers to go. Despite long and voluminous evidence in supportof it, extrasensory perception (ESP) is one of them. The possibility thatconsciousness in whatever form survives death is yet another, as Edison foundout in the end. One might almost come to suspect that science wants death to bethe end of it for each of us.In the matter of Edison and his remarkable spirit phone, it seems that the“scientific intolerance brush” painted all parties concerned. Edison wassplattered by it because, while he was willing to entertain the idea thatspirits are real, he couldn’t bring himself to believe they were anything morethan some electrical manifestation of an otherwise strictly physical world. Buthe at least was willing to invest his waning energy in trying to communicatewith the spirits in whatever form he believed they existed.His scientific critics got the most liberal daubing of that paint for not beingwilling to entertain any theory that violated their notions of scientificpropriety. And Edison’s heirs and estate couldn’t escape the brush either, asthey attempted to expunge the Great Man’s record of any hint of that kind ofextraordinary claim, so his post-mortem reputation would remain clear of anyperceived tarnish.It will not be much of a spoiler to tell you that, as the end of the bookapproaches, the spirit telephone turns out not as a failure, exactly, butcertainly not as a success—definitely not the success that accompanied Edison’sother storied inventions. You know that because, just as we have universalaccess to artificial light, recorded music, and movies (all Edison inventions),if the spirit phone had succeeded, all of today’s households would have accessto a spirit phone were there ever a need—and they don’t.The spirit phone didn’t work, yet I’m not quite willing to call it a failure.Why not? Because maybe it didn’t fail—maybe it just didn’t have a chance tosucceed the way the phonograph did, or the light bulb did after its long stringof failures before the final success. Maybe the elderly Edison just ran out oftime. Had he been granted only a few more short years, we might even now becommunicating with departed loved ones—or even Edison himself. If we could,perhaps Edison would still be adding new inventions to his already illustriousstring of accomplishments thanks to his very own spirit communication device."},{"pageContent":"PREFACE: TESLA’S VOICES OF THE AETHERBY TIM R. SWARTZNikola Tesla was a man of science. Books written after his death speculate thatTesla’s extraordinary scientific abilities were the result of psychic powers andthe paranormal. Tesla no doubt would be chagrined to hear these fantastictheories, as he had no time for the idea that the paranormal was somethingbeyond scientific understanding.According to Tesla in his secret journals, “Physics extends beyond what isscientifically known today. The future will show that what we now call occult orthe supernatural is based on a science not yet developed, but whose first infantsteps are being taken as we speak!”Unlike many scientists, Tesla was not afraid to conduct research on somethingconsidered outlandish. If his interest were roused, Tesla would devote atremendous amount of time in an attempt to figure it out. This is how Tesla mayhave become involved in what is now known as Electronic Voice Phenomena . . .something unheard of at the time.In 1898, Nikola Tesla built a laboratory near Pike’s Peak, Colorado, conductingresearch on thunderstorms and lightning. In his lab, Tesla constructed receiversin order to use radio frequencies to indicate approaching storms. Along with thestatic created by lightning, Tesla became aware that his receivers were alsopicking up signals that were entirely unknown to him.In an article written for Collier’s Weekly in 1901, Tesla detailed the amazementhe felt when it dawned on him that he was hearing something “possibly ofincalculable consequences to mankind.”“My first observations positively terrified me, as there was present in themsomething mysterious, not to say supernatural, and I was alone in my laboratoryat night; but at that time the idea of these disturbances being intelligentlycontrolled signals did not yet present itself to me.”Tesla noted that he was already familiar with such electrical disturbancesproduced by the sun, Aurora Borealis, and earth currents. However, theelectromagnetic pulses that he was hearing were something completely unknown tohim:The thought flashed upon my mind that the disturbances I had observed might bedue to intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it wasimpossible for me to think of them as having been accidental. The feeling isconstantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of oneplanet to another.Afterwards, other work consumed Tesla’s time. But his interest in the unknownsignals persisted, and he strived to perfect his receivers so they could betuned to any electromagnetic frequency. His diligence finally paid off whenTesla began to receive human voices, at a time when radio transmitters werestill practically nonexistent.Unfortunately, there is little else known about Tesla’s research along theselines. His interests took him into other directions, and no other notes havebeen found. It would be interesting to know what Tesla’s ideas were concerningthe strange voices. Did he feel they were interplanetary, or something else?It wasn’t long after that other people started hearing unknown voices overvarious electronic devices, voices that claimed to be the spirits of the dead.It will never be known for certain, but was Nikola Tesla the first to open thedoor to what later became known as Electronic Voice Phenomena?"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION: WHY THIS BOOK?There’s no doubt that Thomas Edison was one of the most practical and hardheadedinventors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In fact, more than onescience historian and cultural scholar has said that Edison was instrumental ininventing technology critical to the twentieth century and creating thetechnology that is driving the twenty-first century. Our world today has comeabout because of the world Edison envisioned all the way back in the 1890s. Notonly did he bring electric light to cities around the world, create the firstmuni­cipal power supply grid, create the technology for motion pictures, andmake it possible for musical entertainers to preserve their art for generationson phonograph cylinders and then discs, he also invented the moderntechnological industry and its research and development departments. Edisonactually created the creation mechanism for driving new ideas and technologies.His achievement cannot be overstated.We also know that, as an electrical engineer and an inventor, Edison was theconsummate materialist, believing that all things that exist, from the bloodthat courses through our veins to signals speeding through wires and eventhoughts that travel through the neural circuits in our brains, are composed ofpalpable, definable, and quantifiable substances. Therefore, the authors ask,why is it that a man who was so accomplished in all things technological, sorational in his approach to utilizing the scientific method as a creativeprocess, and so dogged in his determination to bring science to the masses,turned his attention to communicating with the dead in the final decade of hislife? On the surface, Edison’s system of beliefs and his determination to provethat life existed after death would seem to be an absolute contradiction. Andthat is what most people, particularly the skeptics among us, believe. But thereis another answer, more scientifically grounded, which we explore in this book.Edison scholars and historians have long speculated about his last invention,the spirit phone or ghost phone which, actually, was neither a phone norsomething intended to communicate linguistically with ghosts. What drove him toseek the assistance of mediums and channelers, those whom he referred to in hisjournal as “charlatans,” to help him in his quest to prove that spirits of thedeparted float among us? Was it something of a psychological contradiction, thefantasies of an old man deluding himself into thinking that he could accomplisha feat that oracles and shamans had been claiming they could do since thebeginning of human civilization? Or was Edison really onto something? Did hefigure out an experiment, notwithstanding his reliance upon clairvoyants, whichmight prove definitively that there is an essence of life after the body dies?And if the latter is true, then how did that comport with the cultural andintellectual trends that might have influenced Edison’s view of the world?These questions and others are addressed in the following chapters because we,like the Edison historians and scholars, were just as perplexed about Edison’sfascination with a device to communicate with the dead and his demonstration ofsuch a device to his peers in science and engineering. We believe that bylooking not only at the life of Thomas Edison, but at the cultural andintellectual trends of his life, his ongoing rivalry and very personal feud withNikola Tesla, and his own understanding of the work of great physicists such asEinstein and Planck, that the answers to the question of why a spirit phonebecome abundantly clear.We begin our study with a look at Edison’s childhood in one of the most excitingtimes in American history: the beginning of the Age of Invention, whenelectricity, chemistry, and industrial manufacturing—all driven by thenecessities of war—combined to create an environment of discovery. Edison cameof age during this environment of discovery, participated in it, and helpedshape it. We look at his early education to figure out why a young man socurious about the world around him was so difficult a student. Homeschooled,Edison learned on his own, tinkering with his chemistry set in his basement,starting first a small retail and then a printing and publishing enterprise onthe Grand Trunk Railroad, and becoming a telegraph operator so inquisitive thathe was able to improve the device he learned on. While many biographies ofEdison cover his youth and education, we approach it from the perspective thatlooks at Edison’s lifelong role as a marketer of invention, the creator ofconsumer-driven devices that responded to needs in the marketplace. We show thatEdison helped create and shape the Age of Invention and the marketing ofconsumer technology. Decades before modern office technology companies createdthe concept of the automated office and sold their pro­ducts into it, there wasEdison creating the modern electrical communications industry. He was not justahead of his time, he created his time.In describing the confluence of the Great Age of Spiritua­lism in the latternineteenth century as well as the Age of Science and Industrialism at thebeginning of the twentieth century, we approach these trends not just ashistorical events, but as market influences upon Edison. We show that Edison wasso affected by their coming together that he sought to amalgamate them into aninvention that would respond to a market he believed existed in the 1920s.Hence, our focus on what took place in the nineteenth and early twentiethcenturies is to set the stage for Edison’s thinking and response to what he sawhappening all around him.Why do we spend so much time with Nikola Tesla and his rivalry with Edison inthis book? We do this because we argue that Edison was not only market driven,but rivalry driven. Tesla, for all of his genius and faults, was Edison’s foiland his factor, inspiring him to go places where one might not expect him to go.Tesla, who created robotics, wireless transmission of electricity,alternating-current electric generators, solar-powered generators, and even acrude understanding of artificial intelligence, was not only Edison’sintellectual rival, but his business rival as well. He spurred Edison to do theone thing that prophets and soothsayers had been attempting to do since humanbeings first crawled down from treetops and into caves: communicate with thedead. It was a challenge to Edison’s vision of science and, hence, our missionto explain.In this book, we cover Thomas Edison as a youth, running from his birth in 1847to the beginning of his career. We then move on to the great intellectual andcultural movements that influenced him, from the Great Age of Spiritualism toAge of Science and Industrialism. Next comes his rivalry with Tesla, withspurred Edison to compete with the inventor of alternating current. Then,finally, we come to the spirit phone itself, the science behind it, whathappened to the device, its legacy, and ultimately the legacy of Edison himself.We also demonstrate that Edison’s fascination with the science of his day,especially Einstein’s special theory of relativity and his general theory ofrelativity, are borne out even in today’s news. Simply stated, specialrelativity expresses the relationship between energy and mass withoutconsidering the effects of gravity, while general relativity accounts for therelationship among energy, mass, and gravity. Hence special relativity is asubset of general relativity.We show that Edison was influenced by Einstein’s predictions about the universe,about devices that could register the presence of unseen forces, of theoriesabout the unity of space and time, and how remnants of events in times pastlinger in our reality. We need no further evidence of this than the June 2016discovery of a gravitational wave resulting from the collision of two blackholes, a wave that traveled across the universe and across 1.3 billion years. Itwas finally measured by a device that in some ways imitates Edison’s theoriesabout the presence of particles or wave forms that we cannot see but canregister on a meter.We look not only to the past in this story of Edison’s last invention, but tothe future. We suggest that the scientific promise held out by Edison as well asTesla, their shared theory that there was a science to the paranormal, amaterialism underlying the spiritua­lism, a physics of immortality, helpedcreate a future that surrounds us today. Therefore, we talk about such things asRemote Viewing, now accepted operations in the military, law enforcement, andcorporate spying as well as in entertainment circles. And we suggest thatEdison’s spirit phone, his dogged attempt to bring scientific materialism andspiritualism together at the end of his life, wasn’t so strange at all. It wassimply an extension of what he had been pursuing since he was a young boytinkering with chemicals in his father’s basement, pushing the envelope ofdiscovery. Therefore, even though his business associates, his family, and otherpeople might have thought it strange, the spirit phone was Edison’s lastfrontier, a frontier that inspired physicists for the next century as they triedto unlock the mysteries of how quantum mechanics might be the key to creatinganother invention that would change the world as we understand it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1WHAT WAS THE SPIRIT PHONE?On a chill winter night in 1920, according to an account in the October 1933issue of Modern Mechanix magazine, with the wind whistling through the darknessoutside of his Menlo Park, New Jersey, laboratory, the great inventor,industrialist, and founder of General Electric, Thomas Edison, gathered a groupof his scientist friends to bear witness to his latest experiment. It was acreation his guests believed uncharacteristic of him, yet in reality wascompletely in keeping with his scientific beliefs. He had been working on it insecret, a project that seemed contrary to the technology-driven science Edisonhad embraced since his childhood in Port Huron, Michigan. But this demonstrationwas no attempt at mediumship or channeling, though mediums were in attendance.As the gathered scientists watched, they first heard the soft hum of an electriccurrent, then saw a glow of light from an apparatus on the workbench that lookedlike a motion picture projector shoot a narrow beam of light into aphotoelectric cell. Edison explained that the light on the cell, like the fog ina vacuum bell jar, would register any disturbance to the continuity of the beamwhen any object, no matter how evanescent or ephemeral, crossed through it. Theresulting registration of an object’s presence would be displayed on a meterwired to the photoelectric cell, a telltale sign to the machine’s operator thatsomething was there even if invisible to the naked eye. What was the greatEdison looking for, the scientists might have asked themselves? What could becrossing the beam?Although the arrangement was different from what they’d seen before at thelaboratory, the invention was made of familiar component parts. Edison’s motionpicture projector box had been in operation for over a decade and by 1920 wasalready the basis of an entirely new industry. And a photoelectric cell was astandard piece of equipment to register a beam of photons. But why would the oldman project a beam of light onto a cell instead of a screen? What was thisdevice supposed to do? Edison was cryptic toward his guests at first. But therewere others present in the laboratory that night, people who were as much ananathema to the scientists as heretics were to clerics. They were the very folksEdison had dismissed as charlatans.Along with the scientists in the room that night, participating in thedemonstration of Edison’s machine, were spiritualists, mediums, and channelerswho used objects like Ouija boards and tea leaves to divine what they said thesouls of the departed communicated to them. Edison argued that mostspiritualists were fakes and didn’t believe in their talismans of foretellingthe future, but tonight he was making an exception. Tonight he needed them forthe very thing they asserted they could do: connect with the spirits of thedeparted. He needed them to endorse the concept of his device.Although Edison publicly and in his private writings had professed himself to bethe consummate materialist, who marshaled the flow of electrons through circuitsto provide light, record sound, and make photographic images dance across ascreen, on this night he hoped to show that materialism could also explainspiritualism. He sought to combine technology with spiritualism to see ifindividuals who claimed to have the power to summon the departed could actuallydo so, and in so doing, lure the spirits they invoked across the beam of photonsso as to register on an electric meter. For those in the room watching theexperiment, how many of them would realize that this was a once-in-a-lifetimeevent, the industrialist of his age relying on the efforts of those he had oncecalled frauds?Thus, the pseudo-séance began, the ceremonial invocation of the spirits of thedeparted. Each spiritualist performed his or her own ritual to reach what he orshe thought was the other side, but what Edison believed was simply still thehere and now, a collection of entangled submicroscopic particles of life, unitsthat made up the spirit, but not the flesh, of departed human beings thatfloated through the aether.As the séance wore on, the scientists kept their stare fixed upon the needle onthe meter, ostensibly to note the passage of an entity across the beam, waitingto see if something would register, waiting to see if there were spiritspresent. Were the powers of the spiritua­lists performing their rituals strongenough to lure discarnate units of life across the beam? Was Edison’s devicesensitive enough to register any interruption of the beam? Were spirits evenpresent? They would all soon see.Whatever the outcome of the experiment that night, Edison himself would not bedeterred from his belief that some form of a spirit existed after the death ofthe body. Accustomed to failures of his other inventions duringtheory-development stages, Edison believed that each failure was actually a formof success because it eliminated a possibility. And whatever was left after hehad eliminated his failed attempts would be bound to succeed. Insofar as thisprojection apparatus was concerned, Edison had faith that he would ultimatelysucceed because he believed in the current theories of physics and the presenceof unseen particles imparting life to all creatures on Earth. As it turns out,he did not have enough time, as he passed away on October 18, 1931. Even on hisdeathbed, he was able to arouse from a coma and tell those at his side that hehad indeed found there is life after death, because he had seen the other sidewith his own eyes. And he knew, even as he lapsed back into a coma and breathedhis last, that he had been correct all along.Thomas Edison was a scientific skeptic. Coming of age during the Great Age ofSpiritualism and thence into the Age of Science and Industrialism, Edisondismissed what he called “mediumship” as a form of charlatanism. He mockedattempts to communicate with the spirit world through Ouija boards, commentingon the ridiculousness of thinking that a disembodied spirit could manifest itsthoughts through a piece of wood. In his diary, he wrote: “The thing which firststruck me was the absurdity of expecting ‘spirits’ to waste their time operatingsuch cumbersome unscientific media as tables, chairs, and the Ouija board withits letters.”1 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-080]Yet, being a scientist, Edison was working in an age when huge discoveries werebeing made in the sciences of physics, chemistry, spectrographic analysis, hisown electricity, and the new disciplines of genetics, epigenetics, and biology.It was an age when Darwin had figured out how biological species evolved, whenEinstein hypothesized about the nature of matter and its relationship to energy,when Max Planck was theorizing about the mysteries of quantum physics, whengeneticists were formulating the theory that genes or life units imparted traitsto the human embryo at fertilization that would define it in life, and whenmedical doctors like Freud and Jung were explaining how unseen forces operate onthe human mind. What an exciting time to be alive. What an exciting time to be apart of the very community that was making these discoveries. Yet Edison feltthere was more to be discovered. There was much more to understand not so muchabout life, but about the essence of reality that comprised life and whathappened when life itself seemed to stop after a person passed away. Did thatperson really pass away, Edison asked, or did that person simply becometranslated into another form that we couldn’t perceive through our usual fivesenses? If so, could the great inventor and scientist of his age find a way toenable that form of perception?In an interview in the October 1920 issue of The American Magazine, Edisonconfirmed that his scientific curiosity was intrigued by the nature of whathappens to us after death. In his interview he posed the question, does ourconsciousness simply disappear as our bodies decompose or does some essence ofour personality still linger in some form in this dimension of reality? Edisonadmitted that he didn’t know, but the scientist in him wanted to find outwhether that question could be answered. He told his interviewer that he wasactively pursuing a device that would help him find that answer, saying, “I havebeen at work for some time building an apparatus to see if it is possible forpersonalities which have left this earth to communicate with us.” For Edison,who took his inventions very seriously, this was not a simple throwaway remark,it was an announcement.It was, nevertheless, a cryptic statement. What did Edison mean when he said hewas “at work building”? Clearly he was in a construction phase because he haddemonstrated a prototype of the device. Surely, according to the details of hisdemonstration reported in Modern Mechanix, he had worked out the design of theelectronics. Yet, in another interview, this time in the far more skepticalScientific American, Edison qualified his remarks by telling his interviewerthat, “I have been thinking for some time of a machine or apparatus which couldbe operated by personalities which have passed on to another existence orsphere.”2 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-079] He seemed to besaying that the control of the device would be by those who had departed. Theycould choose to register across the beam or not, which would have beenrevolutionary. And was “thinking” what Edison meant when he said he was at work“building”? Seemingly contradictory remarks like these sparked interest amongthe public in the 1920s because Edison, his inventions, and his pronouncementswere of great import to Americans then enjoying the booming stock market and theunbridled financial optimism of the period, set against a general sense ofdisillusionment in the wake of the Great War.At his core, Edison was a pragmatic inventor, creating apparatuses that he sawas satisfying consumer needs. Sometimes, the machines he invented created theirown consumer markets. Wax recording cylinders, for example, fascinated thepublic because for the first time the human voice could be preserved; hence, therecording industry was born. When Edison perfected a camera that could capturestill photographs in succession and play them back so that they displayedmovement from a sequence of frames, the motion picture industry was born. By1920, both industries were flourishing and Edison, although a national hero, waslooking for a renewed burst of relevance. And he found it amidst the merging ofthe Great Age of Spiritualism and Age of Science and Industria­lism. In a careerthat boasted “firsts”—first motion pictures, first electric light bulbs, firstportable recording devices, first industrial power grid—Edison now soughtanother first: the first scientific approach to communication with discarnateentities. What had origi­nally been the province of faith-based religions, withpre-Christian rituals, and then the practices of trance mediums and channelers,in Edison’s vision would soon be subject to scientific scrutiny, ultimatelyallowing for a kind of dialogue of yes and no in response to questions from thethose in attendance, a form of binary code that would allow, for the first time,for electronic communication with the dead. That was the premise of the spiritphone or what popular news articles called the “Ghost Machine.”We know this device existed and that Edison was working on it because hedescribed it and the science behind it in his diary, even though later editorsof that diary excised or redacted that particular chapter. Why? We will answerthat question later, but suffice it to say that in Edison’s original thinking,he had set forth not only his intention to create a spirit phone or ghostmachine, but provided the scientific theory behind it. This was an earlytwentieth-century theory that has since been borne out by the modern theoreticalphysics of quantum entanglement, spooky action at a distance, and, of course,Einstein’s special theory of relativity.The important thing to remember about Edison and his approach to theunconventional was that he relied on the underlying science of that approach. Hewrote that although he could not be sure whether human consciousness existed onanother plane after the death of the body, he believed that if Einstein’s theoryof special relativity were correct, then nothing really faded out of existence.Mass became energy and that energy, if coalesced into a bundle or packet, mightbe reachable by another packet, this one a stream of photons. Hence, the ideafor a spirit phone had taken shape in his mind: photons to electrons, waves ofenergy converted into patterns of electric charges. And streams of electronswere the very things that Edison had been experimenting with for the previousthirty years, ever since Alexander Graham Bell perfected a telephone.Because he believed that, on the other side of life, the energy amassed by thedeparted exerted a pressure upon our reality, Edison’s device would act as a“valve,” which is what he called it, that would not only open to allow waves ofenergy through it, but, he wrote in his diary, would augment that energy “inexactly the same way that a megaphone increases many times the volume andcarrying power of the human voice.” If we can envision the early phonograph,Edison used that same principle of a huge megaphone to increase the volume andprojection of the human voice. In this way, he believed, even the minutestamount of energy, if it existed on the other side, would be amplified to a soundthat human beings on this side could hear.Edison’s belief that there was a universe of eternal matter, neither created ordestroyed, from which life on Earth was purely a manifestation, also had itsroots in the Platonic theory of noumena, a world of forms, and a Jungian theoryof a collective unconscious, a shared reality in which all life participates.Hence, a device that can so communicate with that collective unconsciousreservoir might be able to carry signals—a flow of electrons—from that side toours.In addition to Edison’s theory of the transportation of electrons from one sideof reality to another, there was also a biological component of his theory thatit might be possible to communicate with the departed. In his diary, Edisonwrote of the memory storage function of an area of the brain, which we now knowis situated on the left hemisphere, called “Broca’s area.” Edison believed thiswas the seat of memory, whether conscious or unconscious, that could play backimages from an individual’s life. We know now, however, that the seat oflong-term memory is situated in the amygdala, the portion of the brain that isalso responsible for the autonomic fight or flight response and, when damaged byrepeated trauma, is also the biological trigger for post-traumatic stressreactions. Broca’s Area, we also now know from the work of scholars like NoamChomsky and Carl Sagan, is the seat of human language development—notvocabulary, but the structure of language itself. Thus, Edison was partlycorrect in his assessment of the importance of Broca’s Area for cognition.If, as Edison has written, memories, which are actually groupings of electronshe called “life clusters,” have an existence independent of incarnatephysicality, then they might survive after the death of the individual in astate not unlike a Nirvana and be able to be tapped. The science, therefore,would be to fabricate a machine delicate enough to identify the presence ofthose life clusters, then to discriminate among the groupings of those clustersto define an individuality. The next step would be to create a channel ofcommunication wherein the living person sitting at the spirit phone canrecognize the presence of those clusters through the photo cell meter. Would thelife clusters understand English or another language? Edison wrote that he didnot know this, but if the spirit phone worked, he would at least find outwhether his theory of consciousness after death was verifiable.Thus, the spirit phone became Edison’s last great project, his magnum opus, toprove that even as he was entering his eighties and had become the founder ofGeneral Electric, he was still capable of coming up with an invention, a machinethat could answer the age-old question about what happens when we die. Whetherit succeeded and what became of it is a mystery. But the bigger mystery aboutthe man who invented the twentieth century, who claimed to have shunned mysticsand mediums as charlatans, who seemed to understand the consumer marketplace,and who translated everything he perceived into things palpably material, is whywas it his quest to prove that his machine could contact the dead? This is thequestion we answer in this book. And so we begin with the forces that shapedyoung Tom Edison as he first learned to read, to reason, and to experiment withchemicals in his parents’ basement."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2YOUNG TOM EDISON“The secret of education is respecting the pupil.”—Ralph Waldo EmersonThomas Alva Edison was a man of his time who, through his inventive genius,superseded time by creating the techno­logy of an entire century. In so doing,he bridged the age of the expansion of America in the 1840s to the age ofcommunication and mass media.Edison the ProdigyThomas Edison, from the time he was a small child, evidenced the traits of atrue American prodigy, ultimately curious and restless at the same time, hungryto explore the boundaries of his existence, and fascinated by the new age oftechnology blossoming around him. He would come to embody not just the age ofinvention and technology, an age of science-based industry, but the Americandream itself, rising from humble beginnings in a canal town to a corporateentrepreneur whose son would become the governor of his adopted state, NewJersey. But none of this was apparent to Sam and Nancy Edison on the night theirson Thomas was born.Edison’s birth was remarkably inauspicious. Nevertheless, the winter chill couldnot dampen the Edison family’s excitement at the birth of a healthy baby boy onFebruary 11, 1847, in their brick home on a bank overlooking the Huron Rivervalley in the small northeast Ohio town of Milan.Sam and Nancy Edison named their seventh child Thomas Alva, a lively infant withan adorable round face, dark eyes, and a shock of dark hair. But though he mighthave looked like many other babies, he was destined to be different. Even as anewborn, he was animated and seemed unusually fascinated by the world aroundhim, by its colors and its sounds and even the touch of the fabrics thatswaddled him. He was among the first generation of natural-born Americans in theEdison family.Samuel Edison had left Canada for Ohio in 1837 to flee capture in a borderrebellion. Nancy joined him in 1841. They settled in Milan, whose population hadgrown from 500 to 1,300 between 1849 and 1851, a growth attributed, in part, tothe construction of the Milan Canal, which opened in 1839 and moved tons ofgrain, bushels of corn, and thousands of pounds of other produce and goods backeast. Milan, on the Huron River, also became a center for shipbuilding, animportant manufacturing center when the country was connected by a network ofcanals that required barges to move goods. However, once the railroads werebuilt and prospered, more and more goods were shipped by rail, which was fasterand cheaper. Like many river towns in the middle of the nineteenth century,Milan was bypassed by the railroads and lost commerce. The Milan canal’simportance and revenues declined and businesses based upon the waterwaytransportation, building materials, and barge construction suffered. As aresult, residents began to lose jobs and seek other places where they could findwork.That year, 1847, was not entirely good to the Edison family. It was a time whenloss and bereavement were too-frequent parts of daily nineteenth-century life,when death often came at an early age. At a time of poor medical care, manychildhood diseases were fatal. Infant mortality rates were high, and childbirthoften resulted in mothers’ deaths from infections and hemorrhage. In the sameyear Thomas Alva was born, three other Edison children died. As the populationof Milan shrank, the Edison family joined the exodus, headed west, and settledin the larger community of Port Huron, Michigan. There, Sam Edison restarted thelumber and grain business that had at one time been successful in Milan. Becauseof the railroad’s influence on growing towns and new cities, the demand forbuilding materials was a growth business, and the Edisons made out well.While Samuel tended to the business of building supplies, Nancy cared for herhusband and children. This was a typical nineteenth-century Midwestern family,business oriented, religiously conservative, and upwardly mobile. She hoped thatThomas would receive some formal schooling in Port Huron, because he seemed verybright and inquisitive. The boy was no more than six or seven when his motherenrolled him in a local school run by a minister and his wife, who was theschool’s sole teacher. Typical of schools during that time, the classes focusedon rote learning, religious studies, basic arithmetic, and reading. The lessonswere mostly memorization and recitation of facts, things that did not exciteyoung Thomas.How qualified the woman was to instruct young children is a matter of opinion.There is no question that Thomas was intelligent and had a remarkable memory,but he was also restless and bored by the curriculum. However, his was behaviorborne of curiosity. He was an inquisitive child, filled with ideas, reluctant tosit still in the classroom while his mind raced with questions and thoughtsbeyond his years. Nineteenth-century educational dogma believed children—likemachines—should be disciplined and obedient to authority. They were not expectedto question their teachers, only to answer their teachers’ questions. Thomas didnot fit comfortably into this unyielding structure of classroom conduct. He wassimply too inquisitive, too anxious to find out what lay on the other side ofthe lessons he was being fed. He was too restless to sit still and simply absorblessons.One day, as the schoolroom tedium dragged on, Tom became fidgety and distracted.It was clear he was no longer listening, at which point the teacher took Tom’srestive conduct personally. She blurted out that he was “addled,” muddled orconfused. Today a teacher might have referred to young Edison as unfocused oreven suggested he had Attention Deficit Disorder. But back then, Tom’sdistractedness was considered a disciplinary problem. When Tom told his motherabout his teacher’s remark, she was furious, withdrew him from school, and, fromthat point on, homeschooled her son according to her own beliefs. His formalschooling had lasted only several months.Mrs. Edison, who had once been a teacher, took over her son’s educationcompletely, introducing him to “natural philosophy,” another term for science inthe nineteenth century, and chemistry, which was his favorite subject. She alsoencouraged him to experiment on his own. Young Thomas was so excited by thesciences and his freedom to explore that he built his own laboratory in thebasement of his parents’ home. There he conducted his own experiments and readeverything he could find about the sciences. Now freed from the constraints ofthe classroom, Tom was voracious in his reading and his experimentation withhousehold chemicals. In fact, even before he was ten, he was performing smallexperiments to test the reactions of various chemicals he found around thehouse. But under his mother’s tutelage and his own experimentation, he wasactually educating himself, although mostly by trial and error, a process thatwould serve him well later in life.Few children throughout history have emerged as geniuses at a young age, but itdoes occur from time to time. Wolfgang Mozart would of course fall into thiscategory. In most cases, creativity is not recognized in a person until lateryears. In Edison’s case, his mother appeared to be his beacon, showing the wayon the first steps of his road to success. It was an exciting time to be on thatroad.Age of Spiritualism and Age of Scienceand Industrialism InfluencesTom Edison grew up at a time when both the Industrial Age and Spiritualism hademerged as significant national social and intellectual developments that laterinfluenced him. As we shall see, the two cultural waves would eventually crashinto each other, merge, and result in a new age of science-based spiritualism inthe late twentieth century, circa 1975. Certainly a young man as bright andsensitive as Edison was aware of both movements. America was in the midst of anindustrial revolution, building railroads and factories, even as the Great Ageof Spiritualism was sweeping the imagination of the country. As Edison studiedhis mother’s lessons and kept notes on the experiments he was conducting, he hadno way of knowing that someday he would become a world-famous icon blendingthose intellectual streams of thought—materialism, and spiritualism—into asingle apparatus.Edison, the Horatio Alger CharacterThe Edisons were a solid working-class merchant family. Edison’s rise to fame asthe quintessential industrialist, making him a very rich man, could be comparedto Benjamin Franklin’s rise from a printer’s apprentice to a United Statesambassador and elder statesman of his time. Edison’s rise would turn out tobecome something of a poster-boy story, in the rags-to-riches tradition ofHoratio Alger (1832–1899).Horatio Alger, who wrote about how he achieved wealth and success in hisautobiography, wrote popular nineteenth-century books for young boys thattypically told of a youth who rose from poor or modest beginnings to become a“middle class and successful” adult by dint of his own motivation and hard work,sometimes with the help of an older, wealthy person. His works were an Americanversion of Charles Dickens, his contemporary, who also wrote about upwardlymobile youths in novels such as Great Expectations. And Dickens’s contemporary,former Royal Navy captain Sir Frederick Marriott, followed the same story linein novels like Peter Simple and Mr. Midshipman Easy: the rise of a young boythrough his own pluck and intelligence to become a person of rank.The term “Horatio Alger” became part of the American lexicon, characterizingsomeone who pulled himself or herself up by the bootstraps. We still hear thisstory today, told by political candidates who call themselves self-madeindividuals, because the idea is to live the American dream of self-fulfillment.And that characterized Thomas Edison. He would certainly have read the popularHoratio Alger books in the 1860s, the most well-known of which was Ragged Dick.Ironically, the real life Horatio Alger did not enjoy the success of hisfictional character, not unusual for nineteenth century-writers who were oftenpoorly paid and unevenly treated. But it was the philosophy of the Horatio Algermythos that influenced young men growing up in the latter nineteenth century.Today, Tom Edison would have been called a child prodigy. However, in his owntime, he was misunderstood by many as a willful, strange, and eccentric boy whofollowed his own path, was easily bored by traditional teaching, and wasincautious when it came to pursuing his experiments. It must have been painfulfor him to be considered an outsider, especially by his peers. Fortunately, hisstrong will and interest in science allowed him to focus on the subject he lovedthe most.Intellectual Influences on EdisonBy the time Edison was reaching adolescence, science was also maturing.Nineteenth-century scientists could look back on hundreds of years of advancesand a process of experimentation and reporting that ultimately became known asthe scientific method, a process through which a theory could not only be provenevidentially, but demonstrated by repeatability. Edison pored over as many booksas he could find, drawing on the works of such notables as Newton, Copernicus,Galileo, Faraday, Watt, Lavoisier, Whitney, Elias Howe, Ben Franklin, andFulton. It was Francis Bacon whose confidence in the advancement of scienceencouraged the inception of scientific societies.Thomas Edison had plenty of material to read, study, and experi­ment with, plushis phenomenal memory allowed him to retain an enormous amount of knowledge. Oneof his favorite inventions, which he learned to use, was the telegraph, creditedto Samuel F. B. Morse. That machine would play a large role in Edison’s future.It not only provided him with his first paying job, it also started his thinkingabout communications technology, the field he would develop as an adult.Edison and the Telegraph MachineThere is some confusion about when and where young Tom first saw a telegraphmachine. Milan, Ohio, town records suggest it was in a telegraph office that waspart of a local jewelry store. Tom was awed by this electrical machine withwires that clicked and clacked as it sent and received messages in a series ofdots and dashes that represented words and sentences. Edison would learn thecode, called Morse code, and would soon become an accomplished telegraphoperator. While other children pressed their noses against glass jars of pennycandy in general stores, Thomas was as happy to watch the Morse codetransmitting over the telegraph wires connected to the machines and operated byyoung men controlling the apparatus. He was an “inquisitive dreamer,” wroteauthor Carol Cramer in her biography of Edison.3[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-078]Samuel F. B. Morse (1791–1872) was an artist and inventor who received a patentfor a system of code electrically transmitted as dots and dashes. Morse’s dreamof becoming an artist was rejected by the United States Congress, where he hopedto beautify the capitol with his paintings. It was sometime in the 1830s when helearned about the telegraph. However, he knew little about electri­city and so,although he wanted to build his own telegraph, he could not. Then he met abrilliant physicist named Joseph Henry, who agreed to help.In 1837, Morse received a patent and $30,000 in funding to construct a telegraphline between Baltimore and Washington, a distance of approximately forty miles.He successfully completed that telegraph line in 1844. Morse’s first message,“What hath God wrought?” was sent in what came to be called Morse code, the codethat Edison would eventually master. To his shame, Morse never gave any creditto Joseph Henry. When the telegraph’s use spread, it also came to Milan, Ohio,by the 1850s, which was when Edison first saw it.The importance of the telegraph cannot be overemphasized. Until its firstsuccess, conversation or news between two parties or locations could only go asfar as the two people talking to each other. Letters were the alternative,although they could sometimes take weeks to arrive, depending on where they weresent from and where they were going. But the telegraph allowed two or moreparties to communicate over a span of many miles, distances previouslyunthinkable. The telegraph revolutionized the newspaper industry, governmentcommunications, the military, and, ultimately, personal communications viacompanies like Western Union. It wasn’t long before telegraph lines were strungon poles across the country. The telegraph was literally the beginning of masscommunication, bringing the country closer together. It was no small event.America was rapidly changing. Along with the railroad, the telegraph machinewould play a large part in young Tom Edison’s budding professional life.Edison, Ironworks, and the Hot-Air BalloonWhen Tom was young, he was also fortunate enough to bear witness to the work oftwo other inventors. One was Zenas King, who worked tirelessly to develop aniron bridge. The other was Samuel Winchester, who, with his brother, wasintrigued by hydrogen-inflated balloons and was eventually successful insupplanting hot-air balloons. Thus, Edison not only saw the beginnings ofinstant electronic communication, but also our first attempts to fly and tobuild iron-based structures. For a boy who was driven by curiosity andinnovation, he was growing up in an age in which the former drove the latter.Before he was a full-fledged adolescent, Edison was already hard at worklearning Morse code and coming to grips with the promise of flight. These werenew vistas for young Edison, the promise of instant communication across vastdistances and the promise of flight, seeing the Earth from an entirely newperspective. By the time the nineteenth century had passed its halfway mark, thelandscape had effectively changed, not just for Edison, who was already peekingover the horizon of a brave new world, but for society in general. For Edison,the conquest of the air and the promise of communication by wire, the travelingof signals close to the speed of light, meant that the world of canal barges andlumbering steam engines was on the cusp of change. And Edison would soon becomethe agent of that change."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3TRAINS AND TELEGRAPHS IN YOUNG THOMAS EDISON’S AMERICA“Stories of brave men, noble and grand, / Belong to the life of a railroad man.”—“Casey Jones,” Nineteenth-century American folk songThomas Edison came of age, set up his first job, and made his first scientificdiscoveries at a time when the American continent was brought together first bycanals, then by the railroad, and quickly thereafter by telegraphiccommunication.From colonial times into the nineteenth century, America’s modes oftransportation consisted of either walking, horseback riding, or boating. Butthen the country began to expand across the North American continent. By thetime of Edison’s birth, better roads and better means of travel werecontributing to a stronger economy as goods and people were able to move moreeasily from one place to another. Better roads also meant that once-isolatedtrading posts could grow into new villages and then into towns. The nextimprovement in transportation centered on waterways, as well-engineered canalsbecame transportation conduits for barges and other vessels. In 1820, thesteamship SS Robert Fulton traveled from New York to Havana, the first steamshipto make that voyage. Cargo boats, barges, and rafts traveled down theMississippi to New Orleans. Along the various river towns that grew up, laborerswould unload cargoes of grains and foodstuffs. New Orleans, already a diversecity by 1815, became a major transportation hub connecting the United Stateswith Caribbean ports of call. However, while the journey along the Mississippiworked downstream, there was no navigable channel that moved north. Thatdifficulty was eventually solved by steamboats that bucked the current andallowed for travel and commerce in both directions. By mid-century, the aptlynamed “paddle wheelers” could be seen stirring up and down the Mississippi. Somewere described as luxury steamers where passengers not only dined and drank, butalso danced and gambled into the early morning hours. Even today, redesignedpaddle wheelers still ply the Mississippi, offering tourists riverboat cruisesjust as they did more than one hundred years ago.Canal travel soon became part of early nineteenth-century life, connectingrivers and lakes. The Erie Canal opened in 1825, connecting the Great Lakes toNew York’s Hudson River and thence to the lower states and ultimately theAtlantic Ocean. With the completion of the Erie Canal, commerce blossomed evenfurther.However, the farther west one traveled, the worse roads were, with many beinglittle more than mud-covered tracks marked by deep furrows. But that wouldquickly change when the Age of Railroads began. In 1830 there were thirteenmiles of railroads in the country. By 1860, the year Edison turned thirteen, thenumber had increased to thirty thousand miles. By 1870 the railroad stretchedfrom coast to coast. The upside was the growth of cities, jobs, the economy, andfarming due to new machinery and equipment. The downside of the enormous growthin railroads was corruption and bribery, inasmuch as there was little governmentregulation in the years immediately following the Civil War. This lack ofregulation left the industry wide open to a handful of clever and cunningfinanciers, such as Jay Gould, a notorious robber baron who seized control ofthe industry. It is likely that young Edison knew nothing about thesemachinations, despite his fascination with railroads—a fascination that wouldlaunch Tom Edison into his future.In November 1859, the Grand Trunk Railroad of Canada set up a depot in PortHuron, Michigan. This gave the railroad an important connection, opening upMidwestern America to points north. It also became a hub for points west,particularly Chicago. In the ensuing decade, the railroad map expanded again,this time across the US, replacing canals as the preferred method oftransporting goods. Railroads were routed to be closer to inland towns andcities, provided the basis for more expansive freight yards, and were a fastermeans of conveyance than mule- or horse-drawn barges.Even during the height of the Civil War, the railroad industry continued to laytrack from the East to the West and from the West to the East, hammering in theGolden Spike at Promontory Ridge in Utah in 1869, thereby connecting the entirecontinental United States by rail, a major industrial achievement. Thus, througha variety of connecting hubs, even the Edisons’ town of Port Huron became partof the larger network of railroads. And because the train station in Port Huronwas close enough to the Edison residence, young Thomas could walk there andstare longingly at the well-appointed depot building. His sights were far beyondPort Huron, and he longed to travel the rails to see new places and explore thepossibilities of business enterprise. At that time, both the railroad andtelegraph had extended in size and influence, and both fascinated Edison as theymoved the country closer together, with both trains and telegraph linescrisscrossing the country in small towns and large. Young Edison began toexperience wanderlust. The call of entrepreneurial enterprise was beckoning him.Edison’s First Job as a Railroad “Butcher Boy”By the age of twelve, Thomas decided to strike out on his own. Despite hismother’s concerns, he obtained a coveted position as what was called a “butcherboy” on the Grand Trunk. Butcher boys, all young men, went up and down therailroad cars as the trains tra­veled from one town to the next, carrying traysfrom which they sold snacks, beverages, candy, newspapers, sandwiches, fruits,and small meals. Think of them as the first flight attendants selling snacks inairline cabins. They sold cigars, soap and towels for passengers to freshen up,and dime novels, which were the popular pastimes of the day and whichromanticized the exploits of Wyatt Earp, Wild Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill, DocHolliday, and Bat Masterson. Some boys even carried a secret stash of magazinesthat could best be described as the nineteenth-century equivalent of today’spornography. From that and the snacks they sold, the butcher boys earned tips.At first, Edison was simply one of the butcher boys. But that did not last long.The young entrepreneur not only worked the passenger cars, he became an employerof other youths, buying produce along the stops the Grand Trunk made and hiringyoung men to sell those pieces of fruit and other items to passengers, thus notonly doing his own selling but profiting off the sales of others by creating hisown downline sales force. This was a foreshadowing of how Edison would run hisinvention factories first in West Orange and then in Menlo Park, New Jersey.The fares along the Grand Trunk were not expensive, even by today’s standards,but the rides could be dangerous as the trains lurched and shook along tracks atspeeds up to twenty miles per hour, all the while whistling, ringing theirbells, and sending wood and coal smoke up and out of the train’s chimney. Therewas always the danger of a derailment or a collision. Also, at first, brakeswere manipulated by hand, which put safety solely in the hands of the engineer.Automatic brakes would not be invented and used until the 1870s.The Grand Trunk railroad departed early in the morning for Detroit and returnedlate at night to Port Huron. Thus, Thomas had a long work day. However, therewas a daily break of several hours during which he had plenty of time to read atthe library of the Detroit Young Men’s Society, a group he joined so he’d haveaccess to their ample book collection. He recalled to friends years later thathe had read every nonfiction book he could find. He was always a voraciousreader, and was especially interested in books about science and history. Hisfavorite scientist was Michael Faraday (1791–1867), both a physicist andchemist, and the inventor of the first electric generator in 1831, arguably the“greatest single electrical discovery in history,” wrote Isaac Asimov in hisBibliographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology4[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-077]. When Tom earned enough money,he bought books written by Faraday.From Butcher Boy to Newspaper PublisherEdison’s strong work ethic showed itself in his many accomplishments, even atthe age of twelve. One of his bright ideas—in the tradition of Benjamin Franklinin Philadelphia—was to publish a newspaper on the train and sell it to travelerson their bumpy three-hour journey. The enterprising youth pleaded with an editorat a Detroit newspaper for discarded type, ink, and other printing apparatus.Type was handset in those days, laid out in a matrix called a “chase,” andlocked into place on a press. With his pieces of type and a small, used printingpress, Thomas Edison became a teenage reporter, editor, and publisher, likelythe first one on a moving train in America. It was a great start to his lifelongentrepreneurial career. Where did he find space on a moving train for all hisapparatus? Somehow he squeezed it into the crowded baggage car where he couldset type, run the pages, and stack the papers before distributing them frompassenger car to car.He called his newspaper the Grand Trunk Herald, and had a subscription price setat eight cents a month, thereby giving him a guarantee of the number of issuesto print and a stream of income to cover expenses and afford him some profit. Inso doing he created a form of a subscription model that one can find in printand online magazines today. But a subscription business model entails acommitment to turn out the product people have paid for in advance, because asubscription payment is really just a loan from a customer that is paid backwith the delivery of the item subscribed. It can be an onerous task, issue afterissue, week after week. Ultimately, Edison found the work tiresome and beganlooking for a way out from under the obligation.One of the reasons he’d kept the railroad job was so that he could give hismother some money every week. The Edison family was often hard-pressedeconomically, and Tom’s income was a substantial help. In addition, offsettingthe heavy schedule of writing and printing, the newspaper and butcher boybusiness afforded Edison the space, albeit tiny, in the baggage car. It was likehaving a private office, production facility, and, ultimately, a laboratory allin one.Edison’s Railroad Car Chemistry LaboratoryBesides printing his newspaper in the baggage car, which the train conductorallowed so long as Tom did not interfere with the mana­gement of the train, theyoung scientist also used the space to perform chemistry experiments. That’swhat got him into trouble, particularly when he decided to experiment with a newtype of explosive he wanted to sell to the United States military—C3H5 (NO3 )3,commonly known as nitroglycerin. One day, Edison mixed the key ingredients(nitric acid and sulfuric acid) into a beaker, let it cool to the appropriatetemperature, and let the nitro compound rise to the top of the beaker. This heproudly showed to one of the military officers riding the train, who became sopanicked when he realized it was nitroglycerin that he tossed it out of thewindow, where it exploded and almost derailed the train. In another experi­mentto create an explosive, something went terribly wrong and Edison’s equipmentaccidentally burst into flames, setting the baggage car afire. That was the laststraw. The angry conductor broke into the baggage car, extinguished the blaze,yanked Edison away from his chemicals by the ear (damaging it for the rest ofhis life), and evicted Edison at the next station. Off went young Thomas, allhis chemicals and other materials strewn on the ground.In one version of the event, Alexander Stevenson, the outraged conductor, was soincensed that young Tom Edison had let his curiosity overwhelm his caution thathe lost his temper and punched him squarely in the ear, bursting his eardrum andcausing the beginning of Tom’s lifelong hearing loss. Then he grabbed the boy bythe ears and tossed him from the train as it came to a stop. Another account,told by Edison himself, is that the angry trainman picked up him by his ears. Atthat point he “felt something snapping” inside his head. A third and moreplausible explanation for Edison’s deafness can be traced to an infection or about of scarlet fever he suffered as a child. Years later Edison’s son, Charles,who became New Jersey governor, was also hearing impaired. Perhaps there wassome genetic hearing impairment. Nonetheless, Thomas handled his hearing losswell, although it made him somewhat isolated from others. He did, however, learnto read lips, and regarded his partial deafness as a means of allowing him toconcentrate on his work without outside interruption—he claimed he never heard abird sing after he was twelve years old.Edison the Young Hero Learns TelegraphyNow fifteen, Tom was walking one day not far from a train depot. His eyes caughtsight of a small boy, perhaps three years old, playing on the nearby traintracks, dangerous even on an empty track. Looking up, he saw a locomotiveheading down the track toward the child with no time to stop. Thomas dartedtowards the track and scooped the little boy up in his arms to safety, justbefore the train rolled by. Tom had saved the child’s life by putting his own indanger.Moments later the child’s father, stationmaster J. U. MacKenzie, came upon thescene. The father was beyond grateful to young Tom Edison for saving his sonfrom certain death. MacKenzie wanted to reward Thomas, but he was not a man ofmeans. However, Tom loved telegraphy and asked if he could learn telegraphictransmission and Morse-code skills from MacKenzie, a telegrapher. MacKenzie wasonly too happy to teach Edison. It marked a turning point in Edison’s life,because it opened up a career path for him in communications. Tom had beenfascinated not just by the telegraph itself, but by the promise of what he sawas instant communication from station to station and along a network. Itdemonstrated to Edison that the world of his parents—slowly moving barges downcanals, letters that would take almost a month to arrive at their postaldestinations, newspapers that often carried stories that had already gottenold—were all things of the past. The new world was the world of electronicmessaging, dots and dashes that instantly connected people around the world by anetwork of wires. Whether it was by serendipity or meaningful synchronicity,this one event in young Edison’s life opened up a path to mass communications,an industry which he would invent and reinvent in the twentieth century.Once he had become proficient as a Morse-code operator, Tom left his job as anentrepreneurial newspaper publisher and butcher boy manager on the Grand Trunk.Armed with new and practical knowledge, he quickly found jobs as a telegraphoperator in several Midwest towns and cities and in nearby Canada. When heapplied himself, he was successful. But he was easily bored by therepetitiousness of the job, and as a consequence his career in telegraphy was anup-and-down affair. His skills were not the problem; it was his attitude andattention span. He could be careless, not always attentive, and sometimes givento daydreaming. Seemingly aloof, he did not get along well with his colleagues,and his mistakes got him fired on occasion. Some of his errors and what somecalled his antisocial behavior could be blamed on his deafness, but not all. Hisrestlessness was a lifelong habit.Another employment problem for Edison was the result of the Civil War’s endingin 1865. When the troops returned to civilian life, many young men who hadserved in the army began applying for employment. Many of them had becomeaccomplished telegraphers during the war, and as such were preferable to lessexperienced ones. Thus there were instances in which Edison was dismissed fromtelegraphy jobs through no fault of his own, but because he was replaced by moreexperienced operators trained by the military. However, he had persistence—atrait that would characterize him for the rest of his life—and when the jobmarket leveled out after returning veterans had been absorbed by the industry,Tom found employment as a telegraph operator in Tennessee.His “freelance” telegrapher career lasted roughly from 1863 until 1868, keepinghim away from his family for most of that time. Yet he managed to return homeonce to visit his parents in Port Huron, at which time he was shaken to findthem both in poor mental and physical health, living in near-shambles. It was amess he did not expect. His beloved mother would linger at the edge of lifeuntil 1871, when she died, and Thomas attended her funeral. His father wastedlittle time remarrying. His new bride was a sixteen-year-old who had been ahousekeeper for the Edisons at one time. She was more of a caregiver than a wifeto the ailing Samuel Edison.The Move to BostonIn 1868 Edison took a position as an operator at the main office of the WesternUnion Telegraph Company in Boston, a city rich in culture and educated people,where a number of inventors lived and worked. In the last quarter of thenineteenth century, Boston was what Silicon Valley and the Bay Area are today ascenters of innovation. Edison at this point in his life was still deeplyinterested in electrical inventions, and in Boston he found several financialbackers for his ideas to improve existing technology. In 1869 he resigned fromWestern Union and proclaimed himself a full-time inventor. That year, at agetwenty-two, Edison received his first patent for an electric vote recorder, aprecursor to today’s electronic voting machines.Although Edison’s new invention was an ingenious device, he quickly discoveredthat the electronic voting machine would not be a success from a businessstandpoint. Even though it was simple to operate, the fact was that nocongressmen were interested in a device that recorded a vote but did not allowfor it to be changed or obfuscated. In other words, in 1869, politics were suchthat a vote you could not alter was a vote you did not want. Even today, in thewake of the 2000 election case of Bush v. Gore,5[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-076] there is still an issue betweenhanging chads and an indelible electronic mark. Edison learned from hisexperience, though, and was reported to have said that it taught him animportant lesson: never try to sell into a resistant or hostile market. If folksdon’t want it, they won’t buy it, no matter how well it works. In the future, hevowed, he would first make certain there was a commercial market before he wouldinvent a product or device.While in Boston, Edison launched a new business, a commodity-quotation servicewith about two dozen subscribers. This enterprise was considerably moresuccessful than his vote recorder, and it brought him some income and profitwhile offering his clients the most current price quotations for gold at a timewhen US currency was anchored to the gold standard.Later in 1869, Edison moved to New York where he continued his work oninventions applicable to printing and automatic telegraphy. By 1870 he hadopened two shops in Newark, New Jersey, specializing in telegraph repair,specifically printing and automatic telegraphy. There he could throw himselfinto his work, pursuing inventions that applied to telegraph operations. He alsoput Newark on the map, so to speak, as a center for telegraph manufacture andrepair. This was important because it demonstrated that a new and profitablebusiness could enhance the reputation of that location—look at Silicon Valleytoday. When integrated circuit chips were first conceived and inventors likeRoyce moved to the Bay Area, Silicon Valley as a high-tech hub was born.Edison Starts a FamilyIt also did not take long for Edison to notice an attractive young woman whoworked in one of his shops. Mary Stilwell was just sixteen when she met Edison,eight years her senior. They took a liking to each other and began courting.However, Mary’s father thought she was too young when Thomas proposed marriage.He wanted the couple to wait. And wait they did, until 1871. Tom and Mary weremarried on Christmas Day. Mary soon found out that the new groom proved to havebeen a more attentive suitor than husband. Once they were married, Tom wastotally absorbed in his passion as an inventor. He ignored his young wife, whofound herself alone for many hours at a time while Thomas worked.In 1873 their daughter Marion was born, followed by Thomas, Jr. Their fatherdubbed them “Dot” and “Dash”—plays on the signals of Morse code.Meanwhile, the inventor went on with his business. At some point he had aboutfifty part- and full-time employees. However, Edison did not like sharing creditbecause he believed the recognition should go only to him. In fact, hisreputation did grow, and within the circles he moved in, many regarded ThomasEdison as a “genius” even though part of his genius was inspiring others andbuilding on their ideas. Today there is still controversy about who reallyinvented what, especially regarding the light bulb and the concept of movingpictures. The ideas might have come from others, as did the work of testing aninvention, but the patents and claims of success all belonged to Edison.It’s clear from the work Edison did in his early years that the inventions heperfected, and the invention laboratories he opened first in New York and thenin Newark, New Jersey, laid the foundation for the projects he would do when hereached his full potential. His efforts on existing technologies set the stagefor him to advance those technologies beyond levels imagined by the originalinventors, at a time when the currents of science and discovery were promisingan entirely new century. Old beliefs of spiritualism were about to betransformed into a new culture in which science itself informed the world ofspiritualism, and vice versa."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4BACKGROUNDS TO EDISON FROM THE GREAT AGE OF SPIRITUALISM TO THE AGE OF SCIENCEAND INDUSTRIALISM“There is no death! What seems so is transition; / This life of mortal breath, /Is but a suburb to the life elysian.”—Henry WadsworthLongfellowIn addition to the individuals who created their own times, think of thoseindividuals like Gutenberg, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and Sigmund Freud,the greatness of whose lives was also created by the times into which they wereborn. The needs of the environment propelled some of these individuals towardtheir greatest discoveries and creations. Such was the case in the life ofThomas Alva Edison, born just one year before the beginning of one of thegreatest intellectual movements in the United States and Europe, a movement thatwould shape Edison’s thinking, as he both rejected it as an inventor and thentacitly embraced it in the last decade of his life. This movement was called theGreat Age of Spiritualism, wherein the personalities that dominated it, some ofwhom wound up conducting spiritual encounters at the White House, and others wholaid down the intellectual underpinnings for National Socialism in Europe, werealso the builders of the cultural matrix into which Thomas Edison was born.Ironically, the life of one of the most important scientists in the fields ofelectricity and chemistry, Michael Faraday, who discovered the principles ofelectromagnetic field induction, the basis for the theory and practice of directcurrent that Edison developed as an industry, overlapped the Great Age ofSpiritualism by twenty years. Hence, even one year after Edison’s birth in 1847,the Great Age of Spiritualism had begun, right during the greatest influence ofMichael Faraday presaging the age of science and invention. These two streams ofthought and discovery would ultimately influence Edison’s work. And though bothFaraday and Edison would dismiss spiritualism as fraudulent,6[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-075] Edison would ultimately employthe very people he disparaged as spiritualists to summon the spirits of the deadinto his photon beam as proof of the concept of his spirit phone.The Great Age of Spiritualism officially began on Friday evening March 31, 1848,in the modest wooden-frame home of the Fox family in a tiny upstate New Yorkhamlet. Hydesville was just a group of homes and several stores and mills,typical of small farming villages that dotted the countryside.7[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-074] The local newspapers and thosewho lived through that winter recalled it was one of the worst western New YorkState had ever experienced. “Biting winds, frigid temperatures, and snowbattered the area.”8 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-073]On December 11, 1847, just two weeks before Christmas, John and Margaret Fox andtwo of their daughters, ten-year-old Margaretta and seven-year-old Catherine(called Kate), both pretty girls with dark hair and expressive eyes, had movedinto the unassuming rental house in Hydesville, New York. The Foxes had otherolder children who were living elsewhere with their own families. They were aclose family, although Mrs. Fox was the friendlier, while Mr. Fox, a blacksmith,was largely impassive and laconic. Both the Foxes were religiously devout andprayed daily, relying on their faith to get them through the hard winter thatfroze western New York State to a standstill. However, despite their religiousbeliefs, they were unprepared for what would happen to their lives only a fewmonths after they moved into the house.From the previous resident, the house already had a reputation for unidentifiedand mysterious rapping noises, but the Foxes ignored the rumors. The previoustenants, the Michael Weekman family, claimed they were troubled by loud bangingat the front door, but when they sought to answer it, no one was ever there.There was also the night when the Weekmans’ eight-year-old daughter cried outthat she “felt a cold and clammy hand pass over her face.” The disturbances weresufficient to cause the Weekmans to move out after living in the apparentlytroubled house for less than two years.Is That You, Mr. Splitfoot?The quiet of the Foxes’ first few months in the house was broken during March1848 when they heard noises they could not identify. Well, after dark one night,when the noises were especially loud, the Foxes searched the house bycandlelight but could not find anything that might have caused the tumult. Mrs.Fox conceded she was frightened by the inexplicable rapping and mysterioussounds of footsteps. She drew her own conclusion about the noises: some “unhappyrestless spirit” was haunting the house.On the evening of March 31, 1848, the Foxes went to bed early, but it wasn’tlong before they were awakened by the puzzling noises. A search of the houseagain yielded no explanation. The children also heard the rapping and tried toimitate it by snapping their fingers. The children named the unseen entity Mr.Splitfoot because of their mother’s fear that the disturbance was “the work ofthe devil.”Kate, the youngest daughter, commanded, “Mr. Splitfoot, do just as I do,”clapping her hands. “The sounds instantly followed her with the same number ofraps.”9 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-072] Now it was Margaretta’sturn, and she said in jest, “Count one, two, three, four,” hitting one handagainst the other, and the raps answered as before.Then Kate said excitedly, “Oh, Mother, I know what it is. Tomorrow is AprilFools’ Day and somebody is trying to fool us.”10[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-071]Mrs. Fox agreed and tried to test the noise by asking it to rap out herchildren’s ages successively. The rappings were correct. She asked it next ifthe answers were being given by a human being. There was no answer. Then shequeried, “Is this a spirit? If you are, make two raps.” The spirit complied withtwo loud sounds. Mrs. Fox asked the spirit if it had been injured. “If so maketwo raps.” There were two raps in reply. “Were you injured in this house?” sheinquired. Two raps answered her, indicating yes.11[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-070]Margaret Fox became alarmed, and called neighbors to her house. One was Mrs.Mary Redfield, who wasted no time telling her there were no spirits plaguing herand her family. She presumed the young Fox sisters were playing childish pranks.Mrs. Redfield conducted her own test. She asked the spirit questions. When shereceived correct answers, she became frightened and left.Mrs. Fox sent for another neighbor, William Duesler. He questioned the spiritthrough raps and determined that a man, an itinerant peddler named CharlesRosna, was robbed of $500 and murdered in the house sometime in 1843 or 1844. Ifthe spirit raps were accurate, the frightening revelation that the peddler’sthroat had been slashed and that his body had been buried in the cellar by aformer tenant who had since moved away was unnerving to Mrs. Fox, who wasstruggling to reconcile her faith with what she was hearing from the rapping.Was someone still hiding in the cellar?Several local men searched the cellar the next day, and by summer they’d foundseveral human bones and some hair. The remains seemed to have been buried incharcoal and quicklime to hasten the body’s decomposition. There was no doubtthat someone had been hidden there to cover up a death.It wasn’t long before news of the alleged spirit rappings caused a commotion inthe neighborhood. Many people wanted to peek into the Fox home to see and hearthe spirits for themselves. According to local news reports, as many as fivehundred callers came in one day. Mr. Fox, a private person by nature, was notpleased with the commotion. “It caused a great deal of trouble and anxiety,” hecomplained. “I am not a believer in haunted houses or supernaturalappearances.”12 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-069] Still, theFoxes could not explain the noises, which grew worse and were soon transformedinto moving objects: shaking beds, slamming doors, ghostly or etheric hands, thesound of someone being dragged down a flight of stairs, and “sounds of astruggle.” The noises were originally heard at night, but eventually were heardboth day and night.There was no way news of the haunting spirits in Hydesville could be kept asecret, and it soon attracted both believers and skeptics who clamored to learnmore about the Fox family and their supernatural experiences. Many wereconvinced that communication with the departed was akin to a spiritualtelegraph.In April, Mrs. Fox wrote a statement about the events that began in her home onMarch 31:“I am not a believer in haunted houses or supernatural appea­rances. I am verysorry there has been so much excitement about it. It has been a great deal oftrouble to us. I cannot account for the noises; all I know is that they havebeen heard repeatedly as I have stated.”13[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-068]What had the Fox sisters done to ignite such a sensational response? They hadn’tinvented anything new. People had believed in—or at least longed for proof of—anafterlife since the time that humans first walked the earth. Ancient burialsites reveal the remains of the deceased in specific positions, suggesting theywere facing in a particular direction, toward whatever gods they believed in,sometimes buried with earthly artifacts to pay homage to their gods. Everycivilization has had its afterlife beliefs, though not all were the same.People, Edison and his rival Nikola Tesla included, have long soughtconfirmation of the spirit world’s ability to communicate with the physicalworld. That is the basis of the belief in spiritualism.The premise is not complicated. Our physical life is not long. However, if thereis a continuation of life after death, then death is not termination. Rather, itis merely a transition to another dimension. And, if so, might some residue ofthe human spirit remain after death, some lingering sentience? This is whatEdison believed. Finding incontrovertible evidence for life beyond death isdifficult to do, but that is exactly what Edison sought. And that of course ledhim to the question of whether we can find evidence that the spirit world cancommunicate with those on earth. Spiritualists say yes. Atheists and agnosticsinsist the answer is no. For them, there is no afterlife. In between the twoextremes are a variety of religious and spiritual beliefs that continue to beopen to debate. Still, we have a right to ask where we came from, why we arehere, and what happens to us after we die.The Fox family had no idea that their experiences with invisible spirits, ifthat’s what they were, had just begun, or that it would affect the whole nation.In fact, the Great Age of Spiritualism was just getting under way. It spreadrapidly and by the 1850s writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Herman Melville,Harriet Beecher Stowe, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, William Cullen Bryant, JamesFenimore Cooper, and Henry David Thoreau were all influenced by beliefs in thespiritual nature of the afterlife. Others, including Mark Twain, did not hold tospiritualist beliefs. However, he did once admit that he had a dream premonitionof his younger brother Henry Clemens’s death later in a boat fire. The writerNathaniel Hawthorne was also dismissive about spiritualism. Nonetheless, hereported seeing an apparition of an older gentleman, a minister, a number oftimes in the Boston Athenaeum. Hawthorne was surprised to learn that the elderlyman had died before he had seen him.When Louisa May Alcott’s younger sister Beth fell ill with scarlet fever, shespent two years wasting away before she died. As Louisa and her mother gentlytended to her at her bedside, Louisa wrote about her sister’s final moments,when she and her mother saw a strange light appear on Beth’s face. It ascendedjust as Beth stopped breathing. They asked Beth’s doctor what that was, and heanswered calmly it was most likely Beth’s life leaving her body. The doctoradded that he’d seen that same phenomenon many times in dying patients.Even President Abraham Lincoln was an avid follower of the spiritualism craze inthe 1860s. When his son Willie died from typhus brought on by thethen-sewage-tainted water supply of the White House, first lady Mary ToddLincoln was so distraught that she refused to leave her bedroom. FinallyPresident Lincoln engaged the services of trance medium Nettie Colburn to summonWillie’s spirit. Her séance, which apparently did summon up Willie Lincoln’sspirit, so relieved the first lady that President Lincoln held multiple séancesafter that, often inviting members of his cabinet to attend.14[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-067]The Beginning of Mesmerism: Tappinginto the UnseenFranz Mesmer (1734–1815) was a German physician, mystic, and astrologer whobelieved that unseen forces made their way around the earth and influenced thelives of human beings. An early experimenter in the fields of electricity andelectromagnetism, he believed he could cure diseases by manipulating theseforces. In essence, he was a physician who was looking for unseen influences onhuman health.Mesmer’s first experiments used magnets that he passed over the bodies ofpatients and actually cured people in some instances. Later Mesmer found that hedid not need magnets and the same healing results were accomplished by passinghis hands over a patient. He termed this “animal magnetism.”Mesmer’s patients experienced both successes and failures with his healings inVienna. Eventually he moved to Paris, where he had a bit more success, but hecame up against experts such as Benjamin Franklin, who insisted Mesmer’s curescould be affected by the power of suggestion. Amidst controversy, Mesmereventually retired to Switzerland and mesmerism became known as hypnotism, theterm we use today.We suggest that Mesmer was a possible influence on Edison because of hisexperiments in demonstrating that human physical functions—he treated differentforms of paralysis that did not have a physical cause—could be influenced bythings we cannot see. It demonstrated to Edison later in the century that thingsunseen could influence things that were seen, just like electrons, which areunseen but perceived, were the conduit for information such as the dots anddashes of Morse code.Mesmer’s coming onto the scene in Europe decades before the beginning of theGreat Age of Spiritualism also was a precursor to the belief that our livescould be the result of forces beyond our perception. In fact, Mesmer’sexperiments on his human subjects became a popular fare for other Mesmeristsduring the middle of the nineteenth century. Some of them even turned whatMesmer was developing as a medical approach into forms of entertainment andparlor games. Thus, the early nineteenth-century work of this German scientisthelped set the stage for the coming of the Great Age of Spiritualism.The Fox Sisters and NotorietyIt had only been a few years since the Fox sisters had become a nationalsensation for the raps and cracking noises attributed to the unseen spirits thatseemed to answer them. They demonstrated their purported psychic gifts tospectators and the curious. Of course, there were many skeptics, those whoregarded the entire rapping episode as a hoax, a clever trick made by crackingtheir joints.The Fox sisters nonetheless became quite famous, and even came to the attentionof the noted newspaper editor Horace Greeley, who called upon them when theyvisited New York City. Greeley’s story explains a good deal about spiritualism’svalue to the bereaved. Mr. and Mrs. Greeley had lost four of their five childrenfrom illnesses, and their grief was overwhelming. The most recent death was oftheir son Arthur, whom his mother Mary had believed to be a medium, and Greeleywanted badly to have spirit contact with him. He announced that the raps weregenuine and not a thing the girls could have done. However, Greeley was notcertain the sounds were from the spirit world. Nonetheless, Greeley publiclysupported the Fox sisters, which not only promoted them but also lent credenceto the entire spiritualist movement. Skeptics had a difficult time exposing theFox sisters, which only strengthened their position as genuine.The girls displayed their rapping talents before huge audiences, as well as atprivate sittings and séances for the wealthy and famous. Among the celebritiesof their era included the writers James Fenimore Cooper, Willian Cullen Bryant,and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Their fame even took them to the White House, wherethey met President Franklin Pierce, the ancestor of former first lady BarbaraBush. For the president and the first lady, Jane, it was a fortuitous meeting.In January 1853, only two months before Franklin Pierce was to be sworn in asthe fourteenth president of the United States, he and his wife were traveling bytrain with their only child, eleven-year-old Benjamin. Suddenly the trainuncoupled and derailed. It tumbled, broke apart, and crashed down a rocky ledge.The Pierces suffered only minor injuries, but their young Benjamin was not solucky, splitting his head open and dying before the eyes of his horrifiedparents. He was the only fatality of the train wreck. Mrs. Pierce neverrecovered from her son’s sudden death.To ease her grief, the frail and introverted Jane Pierce invited the Fox sistersto the White House in the hope she’d be able to make contact with Benjamin’sspirit. This was the first time a psychic or medium was a guest at the WhiteHouse. There are no records or notes of the séance for Mrs. Pierce, but rumorswere that it was successful. It is also ironic that Barbara Bush’s distantcousin by marriage, Jane Pierce, hosted a medium during President RonaldReagan’s term in office. First Lady Nancy Reagan requested it, and hostedastrologer Joan Quigley at the White House to determine the most propitioustimes for President Reagan to travel. When Vice President George H. W. Bush,perplexed by President Reagan’s odd travel departure schedule, askedpresidential aide Mike Deaver about it, he was informed that Nancy Reagan wasreceiving travel instructions from an astrologer. “My God,” Vice President Bushwas reported to have exclaimed. The irony is that his own distant cousin bymarriage also hosted a medium who conducted séances at the White House.Kate Fox also visited the White House when she attended a séance for Mary ToddLincoln. Mrs. Lincoln was an avowed spiritualist and hoped to make contact withthe spirits of her assassinated husband and their deceased sons. This traditionof paranormal and spiritualistic practices in the White House has continued upto the present. In fact, when former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wasfirst lady, she sought to channel the spirit of first lady Eleanor Roosevelt tohelp her navigate through the dark shoals of Bill Clinton’s antagonists in whatHillary called the “vast right-wing conspiracy.”15[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-066] Why Eleanor Roosevelt? Theanswer comes right out of FDR’s early days as president. On February 15, 1933, avery angry Giuseppe Zangara, claiming that he was fighting for the poor and thestarving, and in a psychotic fury over the rich and entitled class, to whichRoosevelt belonged, fired six rounds into Roosevelt’s open-topped limousine. Hemissed Roosevelt but hit five others including Chicago mayor Anton Cermak, whodied from his wounds. And in 1934 a conspiracy among bankers, industria­lists,and military veterans ostensibly led by Major General Smedley—who later thatyear disclosed that plot to a House committee on un-American activities—also setinto motion a coup against FDR.16[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-065] The anger directed at FDR wassimilar to that aimed at President Bill Clinton. It prompted First Lady HillaryClinton to seek out Eleanor Roosevelt, as she had helped her husband deal withan angry constituency during his first term in the Oval Office. It was a furythat would be turned against presidential candidate Hillary Clinton herself overtwenty years later."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5THE SECOND INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION,THE SCIENCE OF SPIRITUALISM,AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON EDISONIt’s easy to think of these two cultural trends as opposites. But to ThomasEdison, who was born into the pull between the world of industrialism andinvention and the world of spiritualism, they were not. Although the firstindustrial revolution had begun at the end of the seventeenth century andcontinued into the eighteenth, the late nineteenth century also saw a wave ofindustrialism and invention, crisscrossing paths with spiritualism.There is no record that Edison as a youth or young man had any interest inspiritualism. He was devoted to inventions, and most of his public statementsdismissed as humbug spiritualist practices such as Ouija boards and séances. YetEdison was aware of the strong public debate between the two sides ofspiritualism, pro and con. Edison was at least curious about the nature ofspiritualism, although he largely sided with debunkers and conservative ortraditional scientists who scoffed at mediums and a spirit-filled afterlife.At the time, Edison had working for him a young man named Bert Reese(1851–1926). Reese was an American-Polish medium who demonstrated clairvoyanceto a high degree, and earned accolades from those who tested him. Edison watchedand was impressed by Reese’s ability. In fact, Edison even sat in at séancesconducted by Reese. One detractor was the famed illusionist Harry Houdini, whobranded Reese a fraud. But then again, Houdini never met a psychic or medium hethought was genuine. Throughout the Great Age of Spiritualism, accusations oftrickery plagued mediums. In fact, many—if not most—mediums were ultimatelyuncovered as shams.The one medium who remained incapable of being impeached as a fraud was DanielDunglas Home. Even Houdini’s one-man war against psychics and mediums could notdebunk D. D. Home, whose abilities included levitation. Could Home have actuallyrisen from the ground and flown around a room or out of a window with no stringsor other support? Houdini claimed he could duplicate Home’s levitation, but henever did, which led some to believe that Home was the real thing. Over thecourse of his career, Home demon­strated a broad range of psychic abilities,especially his claims of prophecy and prognostication. On one occasion, in 1863,Home accurately predicted President Lincoln’s assassination. It was a full twoyears before it occurred in 1865.Another iconic figure of the Great Age of Spiritualism, whose influence spreadacross the centuries, becoming part of the Pan-Aryan underpinnings of NationalSocialism, and who remains important to this day, was Madame Helena PetrovnaBlavatsky, a personage who dominated the late nineteenth century. There is nosimple way of describing her. However, she is too important to omit from anydiscussion of the paranormal and mysticism in the nineteenth century, even ifone only focuses upon her founding the Theosophical Society. Her reputationspread across the world, and was known to many celebrities and powerful peopleof her day. In fact, at one point she even crossed paths, however briefly, withThomas Edison.Born in 1831 in Russia, Blavatsky migrated to New York’s Lower East Side in1873. She was sometimes described as slovenly and overweight. She had fuzzybrown hair and a fiery temper, she dressed carelessly, and she chain-smoked.However, she had “magnetic eyes” that quickly captured attention. Two yearsafter her arrival in the US, she founded the Theosophical Society, bringingEastern philosophy and beliefs to the West. Her epic work was a two-volumemassive compilation of her philosophy titled Isis Unveiled, published in 1877and still in print.17 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-064] (Isis wasan Egyptian goddess and not the modern Islamic State.) Critics blasted it as“plagiarized poppycock” and a “heap of rubbish.” In fairness, thetwelve-hundred-page book did present a study of ancient religions amidst a gooddeal of confused writing mixed with her personal empowerment.Blavatsky longed to bring celebrities and famous individuals into theTheosophical Society membership. She came close to convincing Thomas Edison tobecome a member, and he actually accepted a membership form to fill out, butthen had second thoughts and pulled back, much to Madame Blavatsky’s dismay.Edison did, however, keep a copy of Blavatsky’s writings and, presumably, readthem, although he did not write about them in any of his notes. WhetherBlavastky was a genuine medium or a fraud, there is no denying her influenceduring the Great Age of Spiritualism.Edison also read the works of the seventeenth-century mystic and clairvoyantEmanuel Swedenborg, with whom he was fascinated. Swedenborg’s books, especiallyHeaven and Hell and The World of Spirits, originally published in 1758, wereread by many nineteenth-century notables, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, JohnGreenleaf Whittier, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, andHenry Ward Beecher. Swedenborg’s books were also in Edison’s private library,but because Edison was sometimes self-contradictory when it came to his beliefsabout things spiritual or metaphysical, all we have to go on today are his ownwords in his journals, which dismiss the world of spiritualism and itspractitioners as frauds.The Great Age of Spiritualism might have faded away by 1860 had it not been forthe carnage of the Civil War. The bloodiest war ever fought on American soilclaimed no fewer than six hundred thousand lives, perhaps more. The death tollbreathed new life into spiritualism. The war had left thousands of widows,mothers without sons, and sisters without brothers. In other words, countlesssurvivors grieving for loved ones killed in the war longed for contact withthem. Mediums had a ready audience of the bereaved in the post–Civil War years.In the immediate post–Civil War years, there were literally thousands of peoplewho claimed psychic gifts. Most of them were women. Never before in Americanhistory had women been in such positions of power as they were when mediumscommanded the séance table. A few of the women became famed mediums. BesidesMadame Blavatsky and the Fox sisters, there were Florence Cook, Leonora Piper,Eusapia Palladino, Victoria Woodhull (the first woman to run for president ofthe United States), and Mary Baker Eddy, who became a famous healer and thefounder of the Church of Christ, Scientist, although she despised spiritualismas the study of dark forces. For Mary Baker Eddy the meaning of “scientist” wasone who studied verifiable knowledge, the original meaning of “scientia.”Scientists’ Quantitative Approachto SpiritualismBy the 1880s, scientists, as we understand the term today, began to probepsychic phenomena seriously, forming the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) inEngland, and a few years later, organizing the American Society for PsychicalResearch (ASPR). The scientists made some startling discoveries suggestingpsychic phenomena were genuine. Among the topics they experimented with orresearched were apparitions and telepathy. Still, the skeptics and debunkersgave the SPR scientists no quarter. The critics of spiritualism and other formsof psychic phenomena were not about to yield. It did not matter that sucheminent figures as the psycho­logist-philosopher William James were open topsychic events and manifestations, and willing to test them, which James did—andfound evidence of genuine mediumship.The Great Age of Spiritualism also produced some heated arguments betweenwell-known individuals. One was the battle between the illusionist HarryHoudini, who despised spiritualism, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of AStudy in Scarlet and other Sherlock Holmes stories, and an ardent believer inall manner of psychic phenomena. Another dispute grew up between two famedpsychiatrists of the early twentieth century: Sigmund Freud, who professed nobelief in the psychic, and his one-time associate Carl Jung, who found psychicevents both genuine and useful. Both medical doctors, however, believed that theunseen world of the subconscious greatly affected the perceived world of theconscious.Spiritualism was gradually fading by the beginning of the twentieth century,especially after one of the famous Fox sisters admitted publicly that theirspirit raps were a hoax created by the girls snapping their joints, such astheir large toe. But the spirits and mediums were once again saved by war. Thistime it was World War I, or the “Great War” as it was then called. The carnageproduced by the terrible conflict included many thousands of victims, and thusnumerous bereaved parents, siblings, and spouses. Once again, the bloodshed leftmany survivors, especially in Europe, seeking contact with the spirits of theirdeceased loved ones through mediums and séances.One of the most famous and interesting books from the World War I era is SirOliver Lodge’s Raymond or Life and Death.18[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-063] Lodge’s pursuit for survivalbeyond death became a serious effort after his youngest son, Raymond, was killedin 1915 in the war. After Raymond’s death, Lodge visited several mediums. He hadalready seen Leonora Piper; now he visited Gladys Osborne Leonard, a well-knownBritish medium, who told him she made contact with Raymond’s spirit. Leonarddescribed the existence of a group photograph Raymond had taken with othermembers of his military detachment, a photograph the Lodges had not seen andwhich Raymond, even in a letter sent them days before his death, did notreference. Yet, when the mother of one of Raymond’s friends sent the Lodges thevery photograph Leonard had described, Lodge came to believe that, indeed,Raymond’s spirit had made contact. Lodge, a respected physicist, was alsoconvinced that through the photograph he had made contact with Raymond’s spirit.Parapsychologist Richard Broughton, in his 1991 Parapsychology: TheControversial Science,19 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-062]explained that when the Society for Psychical Research was founded, applyingscientific quantitative analysis to otherwise parapsychological events, it meantthat a foundational change was in the offing for research into psychicphenomena. This was because psychical research could now become a disciplinedscience whose reliability was substantiated by experimental analysis.The heyday of the Great Age of Spiritualism had come and would soon merge withthe new science of the early twentieth century, creating a third culture thatwould influence Thomas Edison for the last decade of his life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6THE INDUSTRIALIZATION OF THE WEST AND ITS INFLUENCE ON EDISON“It is not the length of life, but the depth of life.”—Ralph Waldo EmersonWhen the first English-speaking settlers in America arrived here from Europe tosettle the Jamestown colony in what would become Virginia in 1607, they cameupon dense forests, lush greenery, streams, fields, and meadows. North Americawas home to a native population of some two hundred thousand indigenous peopleseast of the Mississippi River, many of whom would be decimated by genocidal warsand the white man’s diseases, notably fevers and smallpox. Native Americans,organized by tribes, made their livelihood mainly by hunting, fishing, andtrading.English-speaking settlements eventually were built on the unspoiled lands, oftenin the harshest of climates and most austere of environments. Notwithstandingthe inevitable hostilities and clashes between native people and settlers,Europeans managed to build homes, plant crops, and raise families, introducing arudimentary agricultural economy to the New World. Nearly everything had to bemade by hand or with the simplest of crude tools. There was no technology tospeak of. Throughout the 1700s and early 1800s, immigrants continued to migrateto the American colonies, which had become sovereign states confederated into acentral government. Many of the settlers came from England, Scotland, Ireland,and later Germany.In the eighteenth century, Great Britain was the world’s leader in thedevelopment of new sources of energy for manufacturing textiles in factories.The movement was called the Industrial Revolution, and it followed the FrenchRevolution in the 1790s. By the 1790s, small factories were already being builtin a number of New England towns.The phrase “Industrial Revolution” first appeared in print in 1799, written in aletter by a French diplomat who proclaimed that France had entered the push toindustrialize its society. By the later decades of the nineteenth century,“Industrial Revolution” became a more widely used term.In the 1830s, a decade before Edison’s birth, several significant advances hadalready been accomplished in technology. Among them were advancements in textilemanufacturing, iron making, and steam power.Textiles: Formerly spun by hand, the entire operation of spinning cotton intothread and fabric had become mechanized via steam or water power, resulting inincreased worker output. In applying power to what had been a hand-drivenprocess, the textile industry became an early adopter of modern productiontechniques and moved the industry from private households to what would becomemodern factories. The Industrial Revolution saw a rise in the factory system,with fewer products made in homes and more manufactured in plants, mills, orworkshops. Another advance was Eli Whitney’s invention of the cotton gin, whichin one day could remove more seeds from cotton bolls than a worker could do byhand in a month.Iron-making: There was a significant change in the metal industries during theIndustrial Revolution when wood and other bio-fuels were replaced by coal, whichwas more plentiful than wood. Utilizing coke for charcoal lowered fuel costs andmade it possible to increase the size of blast furnaces.Steam power: Steam engines became more efficient and used much less fuel. After1800, the utilization of steam power grew greatly, and by the 1830ssteam-powered boats were replacing sailboats. Steam would also replace water andwind power.Another important industry that emerged during this time revolved around gaslighting, which allowed stores and factories to remain open after dark. Thisalso resulted in some of the first municipal lighting utilities for cities,especially, New York, Chicago, and London.Meanwhile, a new chemical process for the making of Portland cement wasdeveloped in the construction industry. The basic ingredient in the making ofconcrete, Portland cement was important for the advancement of the buildingtrades by allowing a stronger material for the construction of taller buildings,tunnels, and sewer systems. Along with a new technique of producing glass, firstadvanced in Europe in the early nineteenth century, stronger concrete meant thatcities could grow quickly.Transportation methods also saw improvements during the Industrial Revolution,especially railroads to connect cities and carry freight more efficiently andquickly than barges or wagons. There was also an impact on agriculturalproduction with the deve­lopment of new farm machines and technologies.Although the Industrial Revolution had begun in England, the birthplace of manymodern technological innovations, it moved across the Channel to Europe, wherenew textile factories utilizing the power of steam-driven mechanics beganspringing up. Historians who study economics generally agree that the beginningof the Industrial Revolution was a critical step in human civilization, rankingwith the domestication of animals and the development of communal agriculture.It spurred expansion, the creation of jobs, and population growth.The Industrial Revolution marked a seminal pivot point in history because almostevery aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. Notably, populations andincomes grew, resulting in an increased demand for food, goods, and services.Ultimately the standard of living itself was improved.From 1840 to 1870, the First Industrial Revolution evolved into the SecondIndustrial Revolution. Technological and economic progress continued well intothe next century, with the increasing adoption of steam-powered transportation(railways, boats, and ships), the large-scale manufacture of machine tools, andthe escalated use of machinery in steam-powered factories and the deve­lopmentof assembly-line production.20 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-061]In America, the beginning of the Industrial Revolution had occurred in Boston,where Thomas Edison went to work for Western Union in 1868. Boston was a naturalstarting point for an inventor’s career because it was a cultural andintellectual center dating back to colonial days. It attracted everyone fromacademic types to psychics and tinkerers, an early term that included manyinventors. Edison enjoyed walking around the city meeting, watching, and talkingto the tinkerers as they developed and fine-tuned their creations. He enjoyedthe carnival of creativity that marked this early urban environment where he wasfree of mind. He could look at scientists in his own time for influence andmotivation.Thomas Edison had grown up during the so-called Second Industrial Revolution. Itwas an excellent time for an inventor to create and thrive. As Edison also foundout, there was an increasing consumer demand for products, assuming he was ableto invent them. It would be up to him—and other inventors—to determine what thebest ideas would be. For not only did Edison need to create and finance aproduct, he had the responsibility to market the apparatus. As he became moreexperienced in analyzing the markets into which he was inventing products, healso came to realize that industrialization also required the migration ofpeople, many of them immigrants, into growing urban manufacturing centers wherethe jobs existed and companies needed cheap labor. This soon created anunderclass of laborers who would someday require its own consumer market forEdison’s inventions.Industrialization and the Growthof the UnderclassWhile industrialization brought about an increased volume and variety ofmanufactured goods and an improved standard of living for some, it also resultedin often grim conditions for the poor and lower working classes. Many of themwere immigrants, crammed into horribly crowded urban ghettos, barely scraping byeconomically. One of the most fascinating—and chilling—documentations of thelate nineteenth- and early twentieth-century slum life is a book of startlingphotographs and text, How the Other Half Lives, by Danish immigrantphotojournalist Jacob Riis.21 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-060]Riis was appalled by New York’s Lower East Side when he arrived in America inthe 1880s and documented it as a reporter for the New York Evening Sun, writingabout the conditions of the poor and also working as a police reporter. He wasan accomplished photographer and invented the modern conceit of realityphotography as opposed to posed portraits. Riis was also one of the early pressphotographers to use the flash to light up shots in dim light as well as ininterior photos. Jacob Riis Park in Rockaway, Queens County, is named after himbecause Riis, a social reformer, argued that the poor and underprivileged in NewYork lacked open spaces for recreation.London also suffered from overcrowding and pollution as industrialization grewin the early and mid-nineteenth century. Child labor abuse was another problemworsened by industrialization, all of which was documented by Victorian novelistCharles Dickens in such works as Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol. Edison wasnot a liberal, but as an inventor of products for the mass market, like thelight bulb, was concerned about the state of the human condition. All of thishad an impact on the way he viewed society and how he sold his inventions intoit.Edison as a Market-Driven InventorFor Edison, during this period, the importance of market-based research anddevelopment became paramount. After his experience with the failed vote recordermachine, he realized that he first needed to determine a potential market, theninvent a machine or device aimed at a specific group of consumers. Inventionsfor the sake of inventing brought no profit, even though the joy of scientificexperimentation did bring its own rewards. However, if one is to have aninvention factory, which Edison later established at Menlo Park, New Jersey, onehas to pay for it and one’s patents have to have a value for licensing andmanufacture. Other inventors quickly understood that. For example, Clevelandwent from a city of 17,000 to 400,000 people, spurred by the manufacture oflocomotives. The major American industrial city in the latter part of thenineteenth century was Pittsburgh, which had hundreds of factories, refineries,and foundries, and was the hub of steel manufacturing in the United States. Theindustry would sustain the city well into the twentieth century.By 1903, the Ford Motor Company settled in Detroit and began mass producinglow-priced cars, notably the ubiquitous Model T. Chicago, the second largestcity in the nation, had stockyards and steel manufacturing, as well as itsshipping ports for the Great Lakes. The largest city was New York, a hub ofimmigration but also the center of the financial and banking industries. NewYork also became an important retail center, which by the turn of the twentiethcentury helped create an American consumer culture. Department storeadvertisements and catalogues dating from the late 1890s through the early 1900sshow a remarkable increase in consumer products of all kinds. This would havebeen unthinkable only a few decades earlier. In this environment, Edison’selectrical inventions thrived. Technology itself was propelled by newinventions, the growth of mechanized industry, and the speed at which newproducts could travel by rail, according to James Miller and John Thompson inThe National Geographic Almanac of American History.22[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-059]The Edison model of identifying a consumer demographic market, defining a needfor that market, and then inventing devices to sell into that market is a modelstill in place today. Think about the concept of office automation, touted byIBM in the late 1960s and into the early ’70s. They identified the need forintegrated office systems, devices that could talk to each other and share dataand documents, then developed such devices and sold them into the market.Think of social media in the twenty-first century. With just a small amount oftraining, people can communicate with one another and manipulate data on devicesmade specifically for that purpose without the overhead of technology getting inthe way. This is all based on a model created in the early twentieth century byinventors and industrialists like Thomas Edison. Simply stated, Edison developedthe technology to enable consumers to use his inventions without the need tounderstand or be trained in that technology.Looking back from the vantage point of our technology-driven world, it’s hard toimagine that until the middle of the nineteenth century, America was largely acountry with an agricultural economy. It wasn’t until then that there was agreat migration from the farms to the cities. Jobs were plentiful, especially inthe growing manufacturing economy. And with steady jobs came steady incomes.Steady incomes in turn increased the demand for consumer products, all of whichwas important for an inventor looking to sell his inventions.For Thomas Edison, there was no shortage of ideas, only money. The need forfinancing his inventions was a key concern. Thus, he had to meet and interactwith those affluent enough to invest in his projects, pitching them not only onthe technology, but on the market for the technology. If an Edison invention wassuccessful, the investors stood to make handsome profits. This came at a timewhen the US government had a hands-off policy on business, which created a classof people who became the masters of industry. Some of these people turned intorobber barons, whose goal was to force out any competition, dominate the market,and manipulate the pricing structure of their products and services so as tocreate an economic oligarchy.The formula for creating these vertical monopolies was not difficult. It was amatter of controlling raw materials and selling goods at lower prices until youforced out the competition and controlled a specific market, at which point youcould raise your prices without fear of any competitors. One of the mostpowerful and fearsome robber barons was Jay Gould (1836–92), a railroad investorand financial speculator. There was also Cornelius Vanderbilt, who commandeeredthe railroad and shipping industries. Meanwhile, Andrew Carnegie took command ofthe steel industry and John D. Rockefeller created the oil trust.It was also an era of several inventors rising above the rest. This listincluded Alexander Graham Bell, who devised the first telephone (1876);Guglielmo Marconi, who pioneered the wireless transmission of radio waves acrossthe Atlantic in 1901, but who lost the US patent for it at the outset of WorldWar II; the Wright Brothers, whose first airplane flew across the sands at KittyHawk, North Carolina in 1903; and Henry Ford, who created the assembly line formanufacturing automobiles in 1908.Eventually, perhaps in opposition to the way the early robber barons ran theirindustries, laborers unhappy with low wages and poor working conditionsorganized into trade unions to improve their situation. A turning point occurredin 1911 when the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Greenwich Village killedalmost 150 garment workers, mostly immigrant women between the ages of fourteenand twenty-three. Many of the workers were unable to escape the fire, becausethe owners had locked all the doors to prevent people from taking unauthorizedbreaks. That fire led to legislation to improve factory safety standards andhelped spur the creation of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union.The labor movement did not go unnoticed by the monopolies and corporations,however. They hired strikebreakers, put together blacklists of union workers,and used armed guards to disband labor strikes, sometimes violently, andintimidate strikers. Labor-management tensions grew so bitter that between 1881and 1905 about 37,000 strikes were called throughout the country, ultimatelyforcing the federal government to intervene. These are issues still beinglitigated today at both the state and federal levels.The struggle between the owners of production and their workers created asocietal tension that sometimes boiled over. Edison could not help but watch thesocial unrest unfold and wonder what role his inventions would play in thechanging world. Otherwise, his thoughts and efforts were lost in his work.An Undercurrent of SpiritualismWhile the Industrial Revolution was marked by new industry and inventions,spiritualism was beginning to be examined scientifically. Many of itspractitioners tried to employ technology in the belief that the living couldcommunicate with the dead. This is when Edison, combining technological theorywith spiritualism, realized he might be able to invent a device that could beused for communication with the departed. And that would be the spirit phone."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7THE THIRD CULTURE OF SPIRITUALISM AND MATERIALISM AND ITS INFLUENCE ON EDISONA New “Third Culture,”A Merging of Spirituality and ScienceAt the turn of the twentieth century, when Edison’s productivity was near itsheight, there were two competing world views that defined the zeitgeist of theperiod. There was a world of the spirit that we could not see, of ghosts andentities that communicated with us. That belief in spiritualism was graduallyovertaken by the age of science which, ironically, brought qualitative andquantitative analysis to spiritualism and thus influenced Edison to build hisspirit phone. His goal was to determine whether the scientific theories ofquantum matter and energy of life forms existed after death.VrilThe Great Age of Spiritualism that defined the philosophy of Helena Blavatskyand that enabled President Abraham Lincoln to assuage the first lady’s griefover the loss of young Willie Lincoln did not completely fade away at thebeginning of the twentieth century. Rather, after a brief period when itflourished, it then was transformed into an art form and a scientific principle.Indeed, Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s novel, Vril, the Power of the Coming Race,23[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-058] influenced Blavatsky and otherlate nineteenth-century thinkers to the point where there was a belief in thepower of an unseen force, called the Vril, which could be tapped into by humanbeings. Is this like “Chi” as in “Tai Chi” or the “Force” of the Star Warsseries?The Coming Race was an early example of how belief in an unseen force, intowhich those initiated could tap, not only influenced readers, but influenced thefounder of Theosophy. But it went further. Early in the twentieth century, agroup of Russian women, Maria Orsic foremost among them, founded the VrilSociety, which espoused a belief that not only was there an unseen force thathumans could commandeer, but that the future of the human race depended upon thesupremacy of the Aryan race. It was their belief that this race came to earthoriginally from the planet Aldebaran and established itself in Thule, Greenland,and could tap into the Vril. Early Nazi propagandists seized upon this notionand replaced the Vril Society with the Thule Society and searched around theworld for evidence of this extraterrestrial species. This search was the basisfor the early Lucas/Spielberg Indiana Jones motion pictures, just like the Vrilwas partly the inspiration for the Force in George Lucas’s Star Wars.The point is that the Great Age of Spiritualism, having defined the latter halfof the nineteenth century, spilled over artistically as well as politically intothe early twentieth century. There it bumped into and, in effect, partly mergedwith the great scientific and artistic achievements of that time, the premise ofwhich was that unseen forces govern the physics of reality. This is where itinfluenced Thomas Edison and his vision of a scientific/technological invention.Einstein, Planck, Heisenberg, and Measuring the UnseenThe great scientific thinkers of the early twentieth century were physicistsAlbert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, and Max Planck, all of whom theorized aboutthe nature of matter and energy, the relationship between the two, mysteriousparticles, how events taking place in the future influence events taking placein the past, and black holes. The theoretical physicists suggested that thingsthat were not directly seen by the naked eye nevertheless existed and could bemeasured by some form of instrument, even if it had not been invented yet. Thiswas important because these scientists argued that there was an unseen, butnevertheless palpable, reality governing the reality that we could perceive withour senses. In other words, the unseen governed the seen. Einstein went evenfurther, theorizing, albeit after Edison’s death, that not only were quanta ofmatter able to exert influence upon each other, even from a distance, but thatone electron’s spin could influence the spin of another electron, a type ofcohesion of motion. In this way, electrons might have identical doppelgangersout there in the universe exerting influence upon one another. This theory wasknown as quantum entanglement or spooky action at a distance. Although Einsteinwas actually ahead of his time on this theory, it was an idea that partlyinfluenced his spirit phone. It was also influenced by Einstein’s 1916 GeneralTheory of Relativity, which posited the existence of black holes whose densitieswere so great that when they collided, waves that curved both space and time,and even gravity itself, would be generated across galaxies. Such waves wereactually measured in 2016, thus proving at least one aspect of Einstein’sGeneral Theory of Relativity.Freud and Jung: The Unseen UnconsciousEinstein, Heisenberg, and Planck were not alone in arguing that things unseengoverned what could be seen. In the late nineteenth century, biologists,particularly microbiologists, discovered how unseen pathogens—unseen becausethey were microscopic—caused a series of infectious diseases, perhaps the mostinsidious of which was cholera. Also, at the turn of the century, medical doctorSigmund Freud, in part fascinated by Mesmer’s explorations into hypochondriacalsymptoms, sought to explain how a part of the mind motivated his patients’otherwise inexplicable behaviors. What were the urges creeping into hispatients’ realities? What drove their fears, their lusts, their violence, theirseemingly irrational actions? Freud came to attribute this to a part of aperson’s mind that was invisible to him, his subconscious or unconscious. We nowtake it as a fact that people have unconscious motivations that to some extentgovern their conscious behavior. We even realize that actions that impacted uswhen we were children can still drive our beha­viors today. In fact, the entirestudy of post-traumatic stress disorder involves how parts of the unconsciousmind process the effects of trauma buried deep within a person’s conscious. Butin the early twentieth century, this was revolutionary thinking.Similarly, Freud’s student and colleague, Carl Gustav Jung, also believed in theexistence of the unconscious as a motivator of human behavior. For Jung,however, there was not just an individual’s subconscious, there was also ashared unconscious, one that was no less active in motivating behaviors andbeliefs. This Jung referred to as a collective unconscious, a paradigm ofsymbology shared by different individuals across different cultures.I’m OK, You’re OKFreud’s and Jung’s theories about the unseen element of an indivi­dual’sconsciousness and its effect on a person’s behavior was borne out experimentallyin the early 1950s at McGill University by neurosurgeon Dr. Wilder Penfield,whose research into the repositories of memory in the cerebral cortexdemonstrated not only memories, but the immediate presence of events in thepast. Think about Marcel Proust’s description in his book Swann’s Way24[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-057] of the sensation of tasting amadeleine and having his mind flooded with memories of his childhood. Theimmediate olfactory sensation automa­tically stimulated his memories as if hewere actually a child again. Penfield discovered much the same by stimulating apatient’s cerebral cortex with a low voltage charge of electricity, so as toevoke the sensation that the person was actually there, reliving the event.Penfield’s research was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, those same folkswho funded the Mercury Theater of the Air’s 1938 radio broadcast of H.G. Wells’sWar of the Worlds as an experiment to see how Americans would react to asimulated extraterrestrial invasion of Earth. Penfield’s experiments were alsofunded by the Central Intelligence Agency, which was seeking to use the unseenelements of the human mind to reveal the true identities of deep-cover Sovietspies who had infiltrated the United States right after the Korean War usingfalse identities of captured American military personnel.25[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-056] Thus, not only was the unseenaspect of human consciousness argued in medical theory, experiments to prove itsexistence were proven scientifically (and funded by the United Statesintelligence agencies as part of the MK-ULTRA project). Today, the poppsychology self-help books The Games People Play26[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-055] and I’m OK, You’re OK27[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-054] were both based upon Dr. WilderPenfield’s work at McGill.Deciphering the Unseen in Artand LiteratureIn the world of art and literature there was also a new trend gaining traction,a trend in which folks theorized that reality was something only perceivedsubjectively by individuals. Simply stated, different people perceived differentthings even when they were looking at the same thing. Perhaps one of the mostexemplary pieces of literature involving the subjectivity of perception comingout of the turn of the century was Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula. Filmsstarring Christopher Lee or Frank Langella, or even the original 1931 versionstarring Bela Lugosi, don’t depict that the original story was told in terms ofdifferent narratives, journals, and diaries, from different observers, eachdescribing in his or her own terms what he or she saw. Thus, Jonathan Harker sawone thing, Mina Murray another, and Van Helsing still something else. Theartistic conceit was that different people see things differently so thatreality, far from being shared, was differently perceived. And more important,it was the unseen in Dracula that drove what was seen. For example, in the wildchase scene toward the climax of the novel, the pursuers must rely on MinaHarker’s visions in her hypnotic state, within which she has an almost psychicconnection to Count Dracula, to chase and find him. Only her mind was able toreach out, a different level of reality.What was apparent in literature was also apparent in art and in music with theemergence of Cubism, the breaking down of an object and replacing it with avision of that object in an abstract form, in some cases turning it inside out.The most celebrated of the Cubists, Pablo Picasso, articulated this vision, inwhich it wasn’t what was objectively perceived by the artist that wasrepresented on canvas. It was the artist’s subjective vision, the unseen byothers, which allowed the artist to abstract the subject. And in music, theExpressionist composers Alban Berg and Arnold Schoenberg did what Expressionistartists did with their canvases. Rather than recapture the way melody depictedreality, they sought to break it apart to represent what they felt rather thancapture any external reality. In this way, expressionism and cubism both soughtto expose the unseen, the subjectivity of the artist, to the audience.Looking at a deep logic connecting what Heisenberg, Einstein, and Planck wereformulating—the behavior of unseen quanta of matter affecting the universe; whatmedical doctors Freud and Jung were suggesting—unseen forces in the human mindcontrolling behavior, sometimes pathogenically; and what artists Stoker,Picasso, Schoenberg, and Berg were depicting, we can see there is an overridingconvergence of thought. This was the belief system—that the unseen affects orcontrols that which is seen—to which Thomas Edison ascribed.Comparing this to what spiritualists believed during the late-nineteenth centuryGreat Age of Spiritualism, we see exactly the same thing: the unseen, thingsperceived spiritually or psychically, affects what is palpable reality. In thisway, the cultural zeitgeists of the Great Age of Spiritualism and the new age ofscience and Expressionist art merged by the early twentieth century, exactlyduring one of Edison’s most productive periods of invention. This convergencebetween the spiritual and the material of science redefined materialism, andmust have been truly inspirational for someone like Edison, whose inventionsrelied on the results of unseen electrons traveling along circuits to theirdestinations. In fact, we know they were inspirational because, in 1920, thefinal decade of his life and in the wake of World War I, when all of Europe wasmarked by the heaviness of death, Edison embarked on his final invention, acommunications device that could talk to the dead.The Spirit Phone and the Third CultureWe suggest that the spirit phone represented an amalgamation of the work Edisonhad undertaken from his earliest days experimenting with telegraphy, through hiscreation of the recording and motion picture industries, and including his workon improving the telephone. It is almost as if the spirit phone is the objectivecorre­lative of the Third Culture. Edison had spent his entire life as thepioneer of communications technology, building upon his invention of theincandescent light bulb, essentially a filament tube, as a way to repurpose theconductivity of electrons. If you look at theories of subjectivity ofrepresentation, the presence of invisible forces governing reality, and thepossibilities that electrons could maintain identical cohesion with one anotheracross meaningful distances, and then combine that with the special theory ofrelati­vity that posited that matter could not be created or destroyed, onlytransformed from one state to another, we can see where perhaps the electronsthat composed the consciousness of a human being did not perish with the deathof the body, but lingered. And they could be measured.This was not only the philosophical principle of the spirit phone, but thescientific principle as well. Even though Edison believed that most, if not all,trance channelers and mediums were hoaxers preying upon the bereaved, he thoughtperhaps there might be some science behind what they were preaching. If the Foxsisters and Nettie Colburn were onto some form of science, perhaps Edison couldtap into it. And maybe, if he had a device that could register a clutch ofcohesive electrons, he could prove the existence of a form of life after thedeath of the body. And, being a telegrapher himself, if he could develop a code,a form of yes/no responses, maybe, if that cohesion of electronic particles oflife units still carried the sentience of the expired human being, then he couldcommunicate with that mass of electrons that could not be destroyed, accordingto Einstein.Though far-fetched, it would have been one of the most important breakthroughsin human scientific endeavor and typical of the man who invented the electriclight and brought illumination to the world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8HOW EDISON’S INVENTIONS LEDTO THE SPIRIT PHONE“Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.”—Thomas Alva EdisonThomas Edison belonged to a select group of creatively gifted thinkers who,though they underperformed in school, changed the world. If you were to judgeThomas Edison by his accomplishments in school, you would be making a seriousmistake. He belonged to a group of young people who either failed academicallyor had little formal education but moved on to great success. In this he was alot like Albert Einstein and Winston Churchill, both of whom had less thanstellar academic performance records. We call these types of people prodigies.They have an innate ability, sometimes nurtured by their families, sometimes byothers, not just to learn on their own, but to develop what they learn intoimportant skill sets. What combination of innate intelligence and environmentalinfluences produces such individuals remains as much a mystery as it does acontroversy. And whatever the reasons might be, prodigies and geniuses fascinatethe rest of us. A few worth noting would include: * Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) was a French mathematician and physicist. Although physically ill, he was mentally very far advanced. Pascal was only nine years old when he discovered and then applied Euclid’s first thirty-two theorems and organized them in their correct order. At sixteen he wrote a geometry book, and when he was nineteen he invented a calculating machine capable of addition and subtraction. This was in addition to his discoveries in physics, including the law, called Pascal’s Law, that is the foundation of the hydraulic press, that showed that pressure on a liquid at rest in an enclosed space is transmitted without loss of energy in all directions. We would not have hydraulic braking systems in our cars were it not for Pascal’s law. * Sir William Henry Perkin (1838–1907), an English chemist, was only twenty-three when he became the most important authority on dyes in the world. Perkin began working on dyes when he was eighteen. He’d always been interested in colors and the density registration of color so that textiles could be infused with color and would appear brighter. * There was also William Thomson Kelvin (1824–1907), later honored as Lord Kelvin. He displayed the qualities of a pro­digy even as an infant, and by the time he was eight years old, he was listening to his father’s lectures on mathematics. He was eleven when he attended the University of Glasgow, and was only in his teens when he wrote his first paper on mathematics. He graduated second in his class. He was also an inventor who made improvements in the mariner’s compass and tide predictors and many other formula-based theories. He was interred in Westminster Abbey near the body of Sir Isaac Newton.Whether he knew it or not, Edison was a member of that exclusive group ofgeniuses whose names included Mozart and Einstein. Some attended universities;others barely had grade-school educations, and were largely self-taught. Fewbegan life as wealthy young men. Edison fell into the category of men of modestmeans.Edison as the Embodiment of Intuitive ThinkingThomas Edison is perhaps a prime example of a perfect storm of intuitivethinking, who combined all the essentials of creative development.Author David G. Myers outlined “five components of creativity, the production ofnovel and valuable ideas.”28 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-053]The first is “expertise.” The second is “imaginative thinking skills.” The thirdis a “venturesome personality.” Myers offers as an example of this Edison’snumerous attempts to find the correct material for his lightbulb filament. Thefourth is “intrinsic motivation,” and the fifth is a “creative environment.” ForEdison, all five elements of Myers’ theory of creativity are quite accurate, andwe can add to them a tireless work ethic and a Sherlock Holmes–like dedicationto the principle of the process of elimination of what does not work. Theprocess of elimination means that there is really no failure, only the homing inon what does work and the winnowing away of what does not. This dedication tofind what does work characterized the work of Edison, who was absorbed in hislabors for endless hours at a time, ignoring virtually everything else,including family, food, and sleep. His desk was as good a place for a power napor a few hours’ sleep as anyplace else.Edison’s intuition allowed him to identify the markets into which he couldproject his inventions, sensing what the public wanted and then developing aproduct to satisfy that need. This, too, is an element of creativity andintuition. At the same time, Edison’s ability to understand market needsextended to how he worked with his laboratory associates and assistants. Forexample, as we will see, his work with his key assistant Charles Batchelor fromthe 1860s through the 1870s marked one of his most product-heavy creativeperiods.Intuition is also defined as a flash of insight, a process of immediateunderstanding before the logic of reason sets in, a Malcolm Gladwellian momentof “blink.”29 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-052] Intuition hasplayed a large part in the lives and works of scientists, inventors, artists,composers, and other creative individuals. Often a highly gifted person has adifficult time explaining the genesis of a musical composition, a scientificdiscovery, or an invention. It is intuition that includes inspiration, instinct,premonition, or a sixth sense. Was it intuition that contributed to discoveriesby inventors and scientists such as Thomas Edison?Many songwriters have been asked where the idea originated for a certain songthey composed. It is not unusual for the answer to be something along the linesof, “It just came to me.” Johann Sebastian Bach reported that his musicalinspirations appeared without any effort on his part. They just seemed to popinto his mind. If the same question had been put to Thomas Edison about thegenesis of his ideas, what would his answer have been? He probably would havesaid that first you find a market that has a need, then you come up with atheory for a product that will satisfy that need. Then you reverse engineer thescience so that, in effect, instead of proving something you don’t know withscience, you prove something you already believe to be true but have toestablish its truth. This is how science really works and how Edison appliedthat process to the development of his products. But it started with anintuitive thought about market and need.Myers cites a survey that found seventy-two of eighty-three Nobel laureates inscience and medicine credited intuition.30[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-051] One winner in medicine admittedthat at times he felt as if he were being guided by an unseen hand. For hispart, Pablo Picasso said that he was not alone in his creative moments becausehe believed a force was guiding him along the way, to help him find the art thatwas already buried in his mind. Like a master sculptor who uncovers the artalready enclosed in the stone, Picasso peeled away the obvious to find thesubjective truth.Mental impressions, visions, or inspirations often come to talen­ted or giftedpeople in dreams, providing ideas for inventions or even the subject matter forbooks. One successful author sleeps with a pad and pen near her bed so she canwrite down ideas for her novels that appear in her dreams. Thenineteenth-century author Robert Louis Stevenson said that ideas for some of hisbooks first came in dreams. More than one scientist in history has proclaimedthat his dreams and visions led him to discoveries that he would not otherwisehave made. One of the best examples was the great scientist and inventor NikolaTesla, who was not afraid to announce that his visions often guided him to newscientific revelations. In fact, Tesla admitted, his visions were so vivid, inparticular for the alternating current motor, that he merely copied what he sawin his mind as the blueprint for his inventions.Edison as the Anti-spiritualistWhile for most of his life Edison said little, if anything, about psychic orparanormal events, what he did say was typically against spiritualism. Hespecifically asserted that most of his successfully completed inventions wereinspired by his previous failures, not only by flashes of inspiration. Andalthough millions of Americans in the late nineteenth century professed a beliefin communication with the departed, Edison considered the spiritual aspect of it“bunk,” that is, until his time came to communicate with the departed—at whichpoint he sought to find the science behind it.Michael Faraday, the great British scientist who invented the electric motor,was particularly hostile to the belief in spiritualism that had swept acrossAmerica and England in the nineteenth century. He was Edison’s “favorite”scientist. As a young man, Edison hoped he could emulate Faraday in the numberof accomplishments he’d achieve. Faraday also had little formal education; he’dleft school at the age of thirteen. The controversial British naturalist CharlesDarwin also eschewed psychic phenomena, although his later work did encompassthe idea of some form of intelligent design.31[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-050]On the other hand, who knows what ideas percolated within Edison’s mind as hegrew older? His hearing impairment often closed him off to others, as did hisintroverted nature and near-obsessive work habits. If he did consider thesupernatural, he might have said little about it to friends and colleagues.Scientists and the ParanormalThere is a long list of famed scientists and other notables who were open to theparanormal throughout history. Among them were Isaac Newton, Emanuel Swedenborg,Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Graham Bell, Albert Einstein, William James, CarlJung, Margaret Mead, Nikola Tesla, Joseph Banks Rhine, Louisa Rhine, EdgarMitchell, and numerous others. Some of these names may surprise us. Few of uswere taught that the great British scientist and mathematician Sir Isaac Newtonstudied both prophecy and astrology. Who knew that Benjamin Franklin had acuriosity about reincarnation or that he believed that people inhabited otherworlds? How many learned that the American astronaut Edgar Mitchell had a deepinterest in parapsychology, or about his absolute certainty that not only hadextraterrestrial species visited Earth, but that our government knew about itand communicated with them?32 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-049]Do many know that Einstein had books about mysticism and the paranormal in hispersonal library? Throughout the twentieth century, even in the face ofprofessed skepticism, many thinkers tried to reconcile a belief in materialism,the argument that everything is made of matter, and spiritualism, that there issomething nonmaterial in the universe. Edison sought to reconcile the two aswell.Despite his denials, Edison could not resist observing spiritua­lism practicedby at least one medium of his time, Bert Reese (1851–1926), who had earned areputation as a gifted clairvoyant. He first demonstrated psychic abilities inpublic at the age of six, but because he was a child, many people in his nativePoland feared the boy was either a “wizard” or was demonically possessed. By1890, at the West Orange, New Jersey, facility, Reese had become one of Edison’sassistants, and the great inventor actually held séances in private with Reese.Reese’s paranormal faculties once resulted in his arrest for disorderly conductin the United States. To save himself from a jail sentence, Reese demonstratedhis “powers” in court to the judge presiding over his case. Reese asked thejudge to write three separate words or phrases on three separate pieces ofpaper, fold them, and press them in any order against Reese. Reese was correctall three times in stating the contents of the papers. This story, thoughdebunkers have discredited it time and again, is probably one of the few momentswhen the existence of paranormal abilities was tried and proven to be true incourt.Reese had his detractors. Most notable was the famed illusionist and psychicdebunker Harry Houdini, who bragged he had exposed Reese as a fraud. That wasnot the opinion of Edison or many other observers, who felt that Houdini hadoverreached in his assertion. Houdini’s claim that he’d debunked Reese is opento suspicion, however. It was well known that when Houdini could not disprove apsychic or medium, he simply lied and said he did, no matter how credible themedium, subject, or witnesses. His mission to debunk spiritualism and claims ofthe paranormal could be traced to Lady Doyle, the wife of writer Sir ArthurConan Doyle. She had expressed her belief that Houdini’s mother, Cecilia Weisz,a Hungarian Orthodox Jew, was asleep in the arms of Jesus, a statement which,for an Orthodox Jew, was considered anathema. This drove Houdini into a fury andmade him dead set against anyone who claimed clairvoyant abilities.Coincidentally, both Reese and Houdini died in the same year, 1926.Edison’s Early InventionsEdison, as noted earlier, was more than an inventor or scientist. He also becamea skilled marketing expert. After the failure of his first patent, the electricvote recorder, Edison vowed he would first determine the need for a consumerproduct or device before inventing and manufacturing it. In other words, anEdison invention had to have some commercial need or advantage, author NeilBaldwin explained in his Edison: Inventing the Century.33[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-048] His second patent was for animproved stock ticker, one that saw his fortunes rise because it actuallybrought him some income. In fact, he received $40,000 from the telegraphcompanies, a huge sum in the nineteenth century. The licensing of that patentlaunched him into the communications industry. Accordingly, many of his earlypatents dealt with the telegraph machine, which Edison continually upgraded andimproved.In his heart Edison was an inventor, and inventing was what he spent as muchtime doing as he could. With his crew of dozens of highly talented workmen inNew Jersey, he constantly turned out new devices and found ways of applying newmethods to existing technology. One Edison assistant who deserves specialmention is Charles Batchelor, an Englishman who faithfully worked with Edisonfor twenty-five years. He was technically adept, self-effacing, and quiet.Others remained for various lengths of times, as Edison required their skills.With the success of Edison’s reputation, his wealth also grew. In all, Edisonwas granted more than one thousand patents, an incredible number that stood as arecord throughout the entire twentieth century. Yet it was his inventiveness inthe communications industry that began the transformation of American societyfrom a nineteenth-century small-town America into what became a nation united bymass media.One can argue that it was because of Edison that, for the first time in thehistory of humankind, the “message outran the messenger,” as Marshall McLuhanwrote a century later. Whether for military, news dispatches, business, orpersonal messages, the telegraph ushered in a whole new era of communicationsbeyond anything roads or rivers could accomplish. In this world of technologyThomas Edison reigned as a crown prince. He was still in his twenties but he wasthe one in charge, not the others.In 1874, at age twenty-seven, Edison finished his plans for the quadruplexcircuitry, an ingenious device. According to author Carol Cramer in her ThomasEdison: People Who Made History.34[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-047] The quadruplex telegraph wasnot only faster than the original telegraph but, because it could send fourmessages out at the same time on a single line, it was substantially moreefficient. The quadruplex was to telegraphy as today’s email blast to a list isto a single email.Edison was now becoming a man. Not yet thirty, he stood five feet nine inchestall and weighed between 130 and 135 pounds. Certainly no fashion plate, heoften gave a rumpled appearance in his black suit and white shirt with orwithout a necktie. In 1876, he was twenty-nine and self-assured when he quit hisNewark shop to build a laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, with financialassistance from Western Union. Menlo Park, some twenty-five miles south ofNewark, was America’s “first industrial research laboratory.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9THE WIZARD OF MENLO PARK AND THE GREAT INVENTIONS“Keep your shop and your shop will keep you.”—Benjamin FranklinIt is generally agreed that Edison’s most productive period of creativity, hisindustry-creating inventions, took place at his Menlo Park research anddevelo­pment shop. There, the products he invented became the generators ofentire industries. Also, devices like the motion-picture projector became thebasic elements for what would become the spirit phone.In many ways, Thomas Edison was like Ben Franklin. Both were self-starters, bothcame from working/middle-class families, both were tradesmen—Franklin aprinter’s apprentice who became a publisher and Edison a telegrapher who becamean industrialist—and both were the most important inventors of their respectivegenerations who experimented with and discovered the power of electricity. Bothbelieved in life after death and both believed that human beings were not theonly intelligent life in the universe. But perhaps most importantly, both menwere entrepreneurs who invented new industries. Franklin invented the lendinglibrary, the municipal fire department, and the United States Postal Service.Edison, in addition to the recording and motion-picture industries and themunicipal power grid, was the founder of General Electric. But the strongestsimilarity between Franklin and Edison is that the two were individuals ahead oftheir own time. Franklin defined the Age of Reason in America while Edisondefined the scientific and industrial revolution in America.As he reached maturity, Edison knew he required larger quarters for thedevelopment of his inventions. He and his team, many of whom were consultingengineers, had spent about six years working from his shop in Newark, NewJersey. Among their inventions were improvements in telegraphy and, believe itor not, waxed paper. In 1875 the prolific Edison devised the electric pen, aninstrument that allowed multiple copies of any document to be derived from asingle stroke. It not only provided an efficient means for copying documents,but enabled workers to create multiple duplicates of documents. The electric penbecame the ancestor of the mimeograph machine, a staple of offices large andsmall throughout the 1950s and ’60s until replaced by the photocopying machine.When we think of the mimeograph machine today, and the way it empowered smallprinting companies and even political movements, we can see how that devicealone helped to change the world by bringing information efficiently andinexpensively to the masses. Actually, Edison had substantial help from hisloyal, long-time associate Charles Batchelor, but it was Edison who receivedcredit for the device.The Gold TickerOne of Edison’s first practical inventions for the financial services industrywas an improved version of the stock price quote ticker, essentially atelegraph-like machine that sent important information about the value of stocksto subscribers. It was an early version of what became known as the wireservice. Originally, however, the ticker was referred to as the gold tickerbecause it announced the fluctuating price of gold.Edison’s improved stock and gold ticker made its first appea­rance in 1869, butthe story behind it is evidence of his opportunistic approach to mechanical andelectrical engineering, which is how he originally climbed the ladder ofsuccess. As the story goes, Edison was walking through New York’s financialdistrict looking not just for job opportunities as a telegraph operator but tosize up the market for new inventions. He had worked in the telegraph industryas a young man, but he had bounced from job to job, ending up in Boston, where,fired once again because he was tinkering with the very devices he wasoperating, he was broke. As a result, he traveled to New York with the intent oflooking for a job as an operator. But for the excitement generated by New York’sbubbling financial industry, the future might otherwise have seemed bleakindeed. Edison, however, was the eternal optimist.In 1869, financial information was at a premium. The faster information could begenerated, the more valuable the service became. At the center were pricequotations concerning the precious metal investment commodity, gold, which weretransmitted via a telegraph-like machine, a device that Edison had been tryingto improve. Gold was the standard for currency then, and fluctuations in itsprice were an indicator of the economy and the value of the currency.A fortunate moment in Edison’s life occurred when he walked past Laws, thecompany that manufactured the Gold Ticker. This was a time when financier andinvestor Jay Gould was trying to corner the gold market while the Americaneconomy was plunging into crisis. The price of gold was fluctuating and theticker at Laws, where Edison was sitting while waiting for a job interview,could not keep up with the price fluctuations. Finally, the quotation devicestopped working entirely. It simply shut down, and the mana­gers foundthemselves in a pickle. They could not report the price of gold at a criticaltime. The day was September 24, 1869, a day of financial crisis. Whilefrustrated and harried maintenance workers tried to get the quotation tickerback on line, Edison, sitting right there, watched in fascination as attemptafter attempt ended in failure. The thing just wouldn’t work. Finally, Edisonhad watched enough. He stood up and asked for a crack at fixing it, telling themanagers wringing their hands over the silent ticker machine that if he couldtake a look at it, he might find out what had gone wrong.Frustrated and at their collective wits’ ends, but amused at the offer from thisyoung stranger, the men stepped aside and allowed Edison to inspect the device.What would be the harm in that? It had already shut down. But, sure enough,Edison’s prior work with tinkering on telegraph machines paid off when henoticed that a contact had broken off and fallen into the depths of the machine.No contact, no current. No current, no transmission. Edison was able to fish outthe tiny contact point and reattach it so as to repair the broken unit, and themachine started working again. What seemed like magic was merely a mechanicalproblem. The president of the company, who had invented the device, asked Edisonwhether he had the ability to improve the workings of the machine so that itwould not break down again. “Of course,” Edison assured him, and he was affordedhis first job as an improver, not just an operator, of telegraph-like devices,at a good monthly salary of $300.When Laws Gold Ticker Company was bought and merged with another company, thenew owner asked Edison if he could make further improvements. Edison said thathe could, and essentially invented what would become the stock ticker. He wasoffered not just a fee but a purchase price of $40,000 for the new device he hadpromised to invent. It was his first commission. For Edison, this marked thefirst time one of his brand-new inventions would fetch a purchase price, and itofficially marked the beginning of the young man’s career in practicalinventions. He would go on to improve the telegraph machine and the telephone,but the improved gold ticker was the turning point in his life, affording himhis first major sum of money.The Automatic PenThe automatic pen worked by punching holes through the surface of a sheet ofpaper so as to turn it into a stencil. When coated with ink and then pressedonto another paper surface, the ink printed through, explained Neil Baldwin inEdison: Inventing the Century.35[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-046] In this way, a single stencilcould make fifty copies. This marked the beginning of relatively inexpensivedocument copying. With some smart advertising and publicity, the Edison electricpen sold well when it went to market in 1876. The electric pen was the ancestorof the mimeograph machine, eventually marketed by the A. B. Dick Company. Thoseover a certain age will always remember the thin dark blue mimeograph sheets andthe aroma of fresh ink and correction fluid from their public school years.The Carbon TransmitterIn 1877, Edison tackled the carbon transmitter, a device that improved theoriginal Bell telephone by turning the receiver into a microphone in which thecarbon element converted the sound wave into an electrical signal. The carbontransmitter was an invention that not only improved telephone technology, butserved as the basis for the creation of the carbon microphone, an essentialcomponent in Edison’s later creations of the phonograph and talking motionpictures. But it was the improved telephone that proved to be a market success.Although we credit Alexander Graham Bell with inventing the telephone, a marvelwhen it was first introduced by its inventor in 1876, it was far from aperfected device. The main problem with Bell’s invention was that its soundquality was poor, requiring those using the device to shout into it, at leastseveral times, to be heard. It also had a limited range, so that messages couldonly be transmitted a short distance because of resistance in the wiring thatimpeded the electron flow. Edison’s goal was to improve the sound quality ofBell’s invention, and at that he was successful because instead of using amagnet to generate the sound waves to the phone’s speaker, he used carbon so asto vary the current. This removed the impediment problem, thus reducing theresistance, and not only allowed for a cleaner transmission of speech, butenabled the transmission to take place over a longer distance. The telephoneproved to be one of the most remarkable inventions in the communications market,and launched the development of what today has become known as the “informationappliance,” the holy grail of the communications industry and the centerpiece ofwhat will become, in less than a decade, human integration with a universe ofsilicon based AI-driven augmented reality.In 1876, the United States Centennial Exhibition opened in Philadelphia, markingthe nation’s one hundredth birthday. There was a substantial display of Edison’sinventions at the exhibition. Two of them won awards, one for telegraphy,another for the electric pen. As a matter of record the most populardemonstration was Bell’s new invention—the telephone, the first successfulinstrument for the transmission of the human voice. The first telephone to go inthe White House was during the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes. It was so newthat it wasn’t unusual for callers to be answered by President Hayes himself.But it would be at the Menlo Park laboratory that Edison would perfect the soundquality of the telephone so that even the president could keep his voice downwhen he spoke into the device.Edison Moves to Menlo ParkBy 1876 Edison had a new address, about twelve miles south of Newark and sometwenty-five miles from New York. He bought land and buildings in the tiny hamletof Menlo Park, New Jersey, where it was to become the nation’s first industrialresearch center. It cost Edison $5,200, not inexpensive in nineteenth-centurydollars. His workers were his research team and his new enterprise would be an“invention factory,” turning out hundreds of patented inventions. Edisoncombined electrical and chemical laboratories with an experimental machine shopand in so doing created the basis for today’s R&D shops. There, Edison focusedhis laboratory perso­nnel on looking at inventions he could sell into thecommunications market, since media had become his persistent fascination.Edison, like other inventors here and abroad, saw in the development of media ahuge market for his inventions. What’s so fascinating about Edison’s focus uponthe communications market is that today Edison’s own company, General Electric,not only produces consumer appliances, but is one of the owners of mediaconglomerate NBC Universal. It is a fitting cap onto what Edison envisioned asthe landscape of the modern world, a world united by electrical communicationsdevices, as far back as 1876.Edison biographer Paul Israel wrote that Edison’s Menlo Park facility not onlyfunctioned as one of the most creative laboratories in the history of invention,but it also became the model for research and development facilities.36[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-045] It was not just that it was anincubator of invention; it was actually transformative by corralling thecreative processes of individuals with different technological specialties intoa functioning type of assembly line. The Menlo Park facility also helpedtransform Edison from a single-minded nineteenth-century independent inventor toa twentieth-century industrial innovator and manager.Edison received support for his laboratory from Western Union and later from hisown Edison Electric Light Company to showcase to the world the value of creativeinvention for growing industries dependent upon innovation. Edison’s laboratoryeventually became the single most productive and largest privately ownedresearch and development laboratory in the United States. It was certainly oneof the most specialized facilities in the United States.Structurally, the laboratory was a modest two-story frame building encompassedby a white picket fence. The building and grounds looked more like a pastoralsetting than a lab whose contributions would literally change the world.Edison’s loyal and closest associate, Charles Batchelor, also purchased a homefor his wife and two young daughters in Menlo Park. The wives were not as happyin rural Menlo Park as their husbands because Newark was more urban, and NewYork City provided more amusement to the women and children, who were often leftto their own devices by their husbands. Mary Edison described herself asisolated and neglected, and Rosanna Batchelor admitted she also enduredloneliness and, out of fear, slept with a gun by her side.The PhonographIn 1877, Edison devised the phonograph, the machine he consi­dered his mostsignificant invention alongside the motion-picture apparatus because it startedone of the three most successful industries in American history. Ironically,today all three have merged into the wireless transmission of telephony,recorded music, and motion pictures with communications companies such asEdison’s General Electric, Universal, and AT&T combining to deliverentertainment to consumers. Edison’s two great inventions and his improvement onthe telephone turned him into the inventor of the modern age of communications.By 1878 Edison was a national figure, whose fame was akin to high-tech industrycelebrities today like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, or MarkZuckerberg. Thanks specifically to his phonograph or what folks called his“talking machine,” Edison astounded the marketplace with a machine that bothrecorded sound and reproduced it, including music and the human voice, andarchived it on tin foil cylinders. Think of what a marvel that was in the 1880sas the phonograph became popular. The simple concept of recording and storingsound on a rotating cylinder so that it could be replayed over and over againwas revolutionary. To some it seemed almost beyond belief that a machine wasable to talk. It wasn’t only the public that was stunned. So were many membersin the scientific community, especially those who specialized in acoustics, amajor area of research at the time.Looking at these three pieces of apparatus, the telephone as improved, thephonograph, and the motion picture camera, it is easy to extrapolate why Edison,whose marketing genius foresaw the growth of the communications industry,devoted the final decade of his life to the spirit phone. From his perspective,it was simply another communications device. He probably saw that one of thelast frontiers beyond communication with the living was communication with thedeparted.The phonograph, too, was part of that media equation in Edison’s mind because,in a way, and admittedly a stretch, it was a form of communication with thedead. Think about listening to artists who are no longer alive, like CabCalloway or Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, JanisJoplin, or Prince, but who still communicate with us today on records or DVDs,digitally, and on film or video tape. Thus, Edison’s belief in the marketviability of recorded and archived sound was borne out.No other inventor before Edison had attempted to build a machine to recordsound. His was the first. And it evolved through stages, initially recordingsound waves, transformed by a sensitive carbon receiver into vibrations sent toa stylus device that produced analog impressions on a piece of tin foil around acylinder that rotated so as to memorialize a continuous stream of vibrations. Heaccomplished this by devising a way for his stylus to respond to sound waves bymoving up and down in order to create a groove or furrow on the surface of thefoil. When the foil was played back on the stylus, the grooves were retranslatedinto sound through a megaphone device that amplified it.By the 1890s, the device had evolved again when phonograph cylinders werereplaced by platter-like discs. In fact, in the 1950s, when discs were still infashion, they were actually called platters by the disc jockeys on top 40 radiostations and by consumers who purchased them. Remember “The Platters”? Remember“My Prayer”? Remember the last dance at your senior prom? Today, original discrecordings, usually 33 rpm albums, are considered not just artifacts of anearlier age, but recordings for aficionados who appreciate the defects in thesound as opposed to the cleaned-up sound of digitized recordings. For therecord, no pun intended, Edison’s earliest words into the talking machine were“Mary had a little lamb.” This he shouted into the receiver, and the machinereproduced it “perfectly,” he was later quoted as saying.It was Alexander Graham Bell and two colleagues who improved Edison’s “tinfoilphonograph” to make it possible to reproduce sound from wax rather than tinfoil.Bell’s invention was to impose or engrave sound waves into the wax with a needleor stylus which, just like the tinfoil device, moved back and forth inaccordance with the vibrations coming through the receiver. The cylinders had asound quality similar to the later discs, providing much the same audiofidelity, but discs had the advantage of being easier to mass produce by astamping process, called “impressions,” that remained in practice well into the1960s. Discs are also easier to package in protective envelopes and easier tostore either flat or upright, and are less expensive at retail.On one occasion, Edison and associate Charles Batchelor were in Washington, DC,for a large conference when they were called to the White House by PresidentRutherford B. Hayes. What could have been the reason? Some matter of nationalconcern? President Hayes was as fascinated by the phonograph as other millionsof Americans, and so he requested a “private phonograph session.” Mrs. Hayesjoined them for the extraordinary late-night gathering.Today, of course, the recording industry is a multi-billion dollar business,albeit one that is now not just a market of CDs and DVDs, but of MP3transmission, including wireless transmission of sound, making it difficult toeven imagine its humble gramophone beginnings. But, though digital today insteadof analog waves pressed into a malleable surface, the basic premise stillapplies: translate the sound we hear into waves on a disk or ones and zerospassing through a circuit and play them back through a device that reads thecode.Edison as the Public Figure and BossThe public may have been intrigued and amazed by Edison’s inventiveness. Many ofthose who personally knew Edison or had dealings with him often feltdifferently. Many saw a flawed person who was not particularly adept at socialinteractions. And there were reasons for that. For one, Edison could be aloofbecause his deafness seemed to close him off from others. He could also beself-centered, demanding, and a hard taskmaster. He was so focused on his dreamsof inventions that he was not openly communicative with small talk or politeconversation. Today, we might call him a nerd and relegate him to a cubicle at ahigh-tech Silicon Valley development company instead of an electronicslaboratory.But Edison also understood the value of publicity and self-promotion, going sofar as to put his own photograph on his phonograph cylinders. Thus it was rarefor those who worked for him to receive credit for inventions they labored on.He could also be careless about his record-keeping. Employees might be paid ontime—or not. Nikola Tesla was certainly a victim of Edison’s reluctance to payfor work completed as promised. Still, Edison had little problem obtainingpersonnel because so many young men were eager to say they had worked for thefamous Thomas Edison, whom they nicknamed “the Old Man.”For his part, Edison’s hearing loss allowed him to maintain distance from anyonehe wished to ignore. One group he chose to avoid was the hard of hearing. Itwasn’t unusual for him to receive mail from the deaf hoping he would invent ahearing aid. However, Edison did not think he could, and disregarded theirpleas. He also spent so much time at work that he was rarely home. Politely, hewas an inattentive husband. To sum up, Thomas Edison was a difficult andcomplicated man, a genius at one level, but a self-centered and demanding personin other ways. A British engineer once put it this way when describing Edison,“That young man has a vacuum where his conscience ought to be,” noted NeilBaldwin in Edison, Inventing the Century.37[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-044]The Light BulbLet’s get this out of the way first. Edison did not invent the concept of theelectric light bulb. He improved upon it. He invented what became known as theEdison tube, the staple for the transmission of current before the developmentof solid-state circuitry. And as Baldwin explained it,38[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-043] Edison’s improvements upon theelectric light came at the end of a long and complex development history. Longbefore Edison or his associates gathered to invent products at Menlo Park,humankind sought a way to turn night into day by means of artificial light.Centuries went by with fire-lit torches, candles, oil, and gas lamps, all atvarious times serving to bring circles of light into the night. One problem wasthe danger of open fire, another was the fact that many light sources were notvery successful in illuminating a large area. And all of them gave off smoke,sometimes black smoke that hung heavy in the air. Ever try to read bycandlelight? Even oil and gas lamps are not very practical for lighting morethan a small space after dark.For many centuries, scientists were aware of static electricity, the electricalcharge produced by friction. Perhaps some had already borne witness to so-called“earthquake lights,” electrical flashes resulting from the static electricitygenerated by underground friction. The problem was how the electricity could beseparately harnessed and channeled. The first significant efforts occurred bythe mid-eighteenth century with the invention of the Leyden jar. Within theLeyden jar, static electricity was accumulated and then discharged in a singleflash. But even the great American patriot and scientist Benjamin Franklin, whodiscovered that lightning had the same properties as static electricity when heflew a kite in a thunderstorm, could not find anything useful to humankind fromelectricity except to understand how it was transmitted in nature. Otherscientists and inventors also tried to capture electricity for practicalapplication, all with limited or no success even though they understoodelectricity was a form of energy. For example, British scientist Sir HumphryDavy employed a huge battery to display how electri­city could be made togenerate light. In its early days, many people found electricity little morethan an amusing toy. But it was Edison who would change that toy into a utility.Edison was already a celebrated personality when he began to tackle transformingthe spark from a flash of electricity into a continuous current that burned afilament so that it glowed within a vacuum without catching fire. The light bulbas an idea had already been developed as early as 1802, but it was not apractical device. Edison sought to turn what was an oddity into a commodity.However, when he started work on it in summer of 1878, he was to discover thatthe process was more difficult and lengthier than he anticipated.Although the fundamentals of light technology were generally understood by then,Edison and his team had a great deal to learn before they could turn the theoryof transmitting electricity across a wire that would not burn up from thecurrent into a practical device that could be marketed. That meant creating aheating element, a filament or wire that would not incinerate but would onlyglow, hence throw off light. The solution of the incineration problem was anunderstanding that in order to burn, a substance needed oxygen. Deprive anenvironment of oxygen and an element might glow from heat, but it wouldn’toxidize. That was the secret. To do this, Edison enclosed the entire circuit,the filament that would convey the current, within a vacuum protected by a glassenclosure, thus preventing oxidation.Once Edison became excited about producing a practical incandescent light bulb,he worked tirelessly. His task was to find the perfect incandescent filament orwire that would heat up in an electrical appliance that could be vacuum enclosedwithin a glass bulb. Edison remained confident they could accomplish thispractically and at a cost that would allow for mass marketing. His investorswere not as sure as he was. One material he tried was platinum, but it provedtoo expensive. The team finally found the filament material that would work totheir satisfaction: carbon. It was both plentiful and inexpensive and would lastlong enough during continuous use to make it an item consumers would buy. WhenEdison’s light bulb was first demonstrated in 1879, it was immensely successfuland widely praised. And the Edison bulb, the incandescent bulb, remains in usetoday, although governments are looking to phase it out because of the amount ofenergy it consumes.The Invention of the Electric Gridand Municipal Power DistributionIn 1880 Edison determined how to distribute electric current across a system ofcables.39 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-042] By using undergroundcables, not unlike the way water and gas were distributed, electricity could bedispersed and metered. And because metering allowed for accounting for the useof the electricity, investors in power distribution could charge for it.Edison’s first central power station was on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan.There, powerful dynamos or generators were built that would provide electricityto homes and offices. It was a long and time-consuming process to bring his goalto fruition. There were mishaps and delays, but finally the system worked.Edison declared he was satisfied, and today, “Edison” power companies like ConEdison in New York and Pacific Edison in California are the common names of theelectric utilities.At Menlo Park, under Edison’s leadership and inventiveness, the Age ofElectricity was born, and in decades ahead it would become accessible to peopleeverywhere and transform not only the United States, but human civilization aswell."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10EDISON, THE FATHER OF THE MOTION-PICTURE INDUSTRY: THE FIRST STEPTO THE SPIRIT PHONEEdison’s development of a projector to throw a narrow beam of light at adistance was the first step in assembling the components of what would becomehis spirit phone.Thomas Edison’s major inventions often built upon themselves to spawn newindustries. Thus, along with the communications industry, Edison’s mostimportant and far-reaching innovation spawned the motion-picture industry which,almost from the first moments of silent movies, became the defining principle ofmodern society. It not only reflected society’s values, it refracted them insuch a way as to move society forward while defining the values of societyitself. Compare D. W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation to Stanley Kramer’s GuessWho’s Coming to Dinner or the Mickey Rooney minstrel show dance number inblackface in Busby Berkeley’s Babes in Arms to Gary Gray’s Straight OuttaCompton to illustrate this theory. And all this takes place within a singlecentury.One only has to look at motion pictures today to see how they have moved publicconsciousness, made us self-aware, and showcased values to which our societymust aspire. Was this in Edison’s mind when he fabricated the threading devicethat allowed a strip of images on sprockets to move along a spool in front of apower­ful beam of light? Probably not, but inventions have a way of definingthemselves and their own futures once they’re launched, much like a virusseeking out new hosts and new ways to multiply and thrive. So it was with themotion-picture camera and projection apparatus, now squeezed into a digitalformat and pressed into a wireless telephone. This is also the result ofEdison’s improvements to the original device, so that the communications,recording, and motion-picture industries can be packaged in a small box, wrappedin a bow and sitting under a tree on Christmas morning. Quite an achievement.But there’s much more because the basic premise of focusing a beam of lightthrough a photograph onto a screen gave rise, in Edison’s mind, to anotherpossibility. And that was the spirit phone. Given the simplicity of thespirit-phone apparatus, it is not hard to see how Edison’s development of theelectronic motion-picture projector was its logical precursor.The Pre-history of Motion PicturesProjection devices were brought into existence as early as the seven­teenthcentury by Athanasius Kircher, who called his device a magic lantern thatprojected images upon a surface. This was during the first ScientificRevolution. Thus, projection itself preceded by at least two hundred and fortyyears Edison’s device. And as early as 1832, just sixty years before Edisonbegan his process of motion-picture development, the first moving images wereprojected upon a screen. In 1882, Etienne Jules Marey created a camera thatcould take rapid photographs in sequence, which is what Eadweard Muybridge hadshown only ten years earlier when he took photographs in a sequence of agalloping horse, to prove that its fore and hind hooves were off the ground atthe same time. When viewed in rapid succession, Muybridge’s photos actuallyshowed the horse moving even though each frame was a still. That is how the eye,because of retinal memory or retention, played tricks on the brain, by making aseries of rapidly moving still images look like an object in motion. You can trythis yourself with a series of stick figures, gradually changing positions frompage to page on a paper pad. It’s called a flip book.Although these inventions preceded Edison’s camera, it would be Edison himselfto conceive of a recording and playback device to manipulate and display visualimages in the same way that his phonograph captured, recorded, and played backaudio. But how to do it? The camera already existed that could capture stillphotos. And Eadweard Muybridge had demonstrated in 1872 just how a succession ofimages could be made to look like moving images. The question was how toassemble this into a single camera and single playback device.By 1889, celluloid film had been created and was being used from time to time asa replacement for photographic plates. What Edison’s associate William KennedyDickson figured out was that by punching holes along the edges of a roll ofcelluloid film, so that it would not interfere with the exposure window, hecould align those holes with the prongs inside a camera so as to allow the filmto track along a series of sprockets. Thus, he was able to create a mechanism ofrapid exposures in sequence to give the appearance of motion. Now, havingexposed the film, how to play it back?Edison’s KinetoscopeEdison solved the projection problem by moving the film on a series of sprocketsbeneath a magnifying glass that was brightly illuminated from behind. A viewercould look through the magnifying glass at the film and see the succession offrames play before his or her eyes, thus, in effect, watching a primitive shortmotion picture. However, there was no projector, only a viewer. Edison calledthis device the kinetoscope, which he patented in 1893 and began showing off tothe public. He constructed a studio for making his films in New Jersey and thenplanned to open a series of viewing parlors where customers could pay a fee andwatch a short film loop. One of the first of these was called The Sneeze,starring one of the workers at Edison’s laboratory. At first, Edison saw hiskinetoscope as a novelty, a diversion, instead of a business, not realizing thathe was on the cusp of creating an industry much like the recording industry. Andas a result of Edison’s initial short-sightedness, he did not register a foreignpatent for his kinetoscope. Accordingly, unlike today’s internationalintellectual property protocols, like the World Trade Organization, the BerneConvention, or the World International Property Organization, a failure toregister a foreign patent meant that foreign developers could copy an inventionwithout any liability for patent infringement and without the need to licensethe intellectual property. That’s exactly what happened to the kinetoscope whenforeign developers got their hands on the device.Improvements to the KinetoscopeIn one adaptation and improvement, an English inventor, Robert Paul, who livedto see the expansion of the motion picture industry right up to World War II,developed a projection device that didn’t just flip through the frames, but heldthe frame in place before the next one came up. Thus, his early films seemed toflicker on the screen, giving the modern slang name “flicks” to motion pictures.Across the Channel in France, the Lumière Brothers developed their own cameraand projection device, which they, like Paul, were able to use to display imagesupon a screen. This meant that more than one viewer could watch a movie at thesame time, and it opened up the possibility of motion-picture exhibition houses,or movie theaters.The Vitascope and the MotionPicture IndustryEdison was, as we have seen, a consummate opportunist. He watched at first withfascination how his own invention, the kinetoscope, was overtaken by largescreen projection units, which prompted him to develop his own projectionapparatus. In the United States, Edison had left the movie-projector industry,but in 1895 the kinetoscope was replaced by the Vitascope, invented by CharlesJenkins and Thomas Armat. This popularized motion pictures and began to attractconsumer viewing audiences. By the turn of the century, people were going to thefirst theaters. Other entrepreneurs became involved. Acting as distributors,they marketed their films to the independent exhibition houses. Thus, the entirefilm distribution industry began. It attracted entrepreneurs from otherindustries, including scrap metal buyer and later burlesque theater owner LouisB. Mayer, glove manufacturer Samuel Goldwyn, bookkeeper and owner of anickelodeon business Carl Lammele, and streetcar conductor and later musicprinter Harry Cohn, all of whom became the first studio magnates, the patriarchsof Hollywood. With the expansion of theaters came the drive by the studio mogulsto own the exhibition houses themselves, which they did, effectively creatingvertical monopolies until the Supreme Court in United States v. ParamountPictures, Inc., (334 US 131 [1948]) effectively broke up the distributionmonopolies, weakening the power of the studios and creating a power vacuum fortalent agencies and their lawyers.But as fascinating as this history of motion pictures is, more important for ourpurposes is its relevance to Edison’s spirit phone. For those who are old enoughto remember the audio-visual squads in elementary schools rolling motion pictureor slide projectors into classrooms to show films, we might also remember thatwhen the projection light was first turned on in a darkened classroom, somestudents created shadow figures against the light. They did this by interruptingthe light beam with their hands, which projected sha­dows upon the screen. Thiswas the basis of the projector in the spirit phone.Edison, seeing how the screen displayed the interruption of the light beam,speculated that even dust motes, barely visible to the eye, could interfere withthe beam of the light. If barely visible objects could interrupt the light beam,what about objects that were just as real but too small to be seen with thenaked eye? Might these objects, if such existed, also be capable of interruptingthe beam? And what if that were possible and the objects were invisible to thenaked eye? Might there be another way to register the interruption of the beam?It was there that Edison hit upon the idea that instead of a screen to displaythe image interrupting the beam, an electronic registering device, displayingonly photoelectric current, might act as a screen for something too small to bevisible to the naked eye. And that device was a screen of sorts, only not thereflecting screen of the Lumière Brothers. It was a photoelectric cell thatcompleted a circuit generated by the beam of light, actually a beam of photonshitting the electrically sensitive material. When the beam was interrupted, thephotoelectric cell gave off its own signal, a weak current that would bedisplayed on a sensitive meter attached to the cell. And thus, the idea for adevice to make palpable the unseen was born. It wouldn’t come to any sort ofproof of concept development for at least another twenty years."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11EDISON VS. TESLA AND THE BATTLEOF THE CURRENTSOne of the great events in my life was my first meeting with Edison. Thiswonderful man, who had received no scientific training, yet had accomplished somuch, filled me with amazement. I felt that the time I had spent studyinglanguages, literature and art was wasted; though later, of course, I learnedthis was not so.—Nikola Tesla “Making Your Imagination Work for You”The American Magazine, April, 1921Creative genius and a keen sense of what products the market needed were not theonly driving forces propelling Edison’s career. Of importance as well, even ifreduced only to pure business and psychological competition, was Edison’spersonal rivalry with Serbo-Croatian scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla. Giventheir half-century of contentiousness and their battle over the business ofmunicipal electrical-power distribution, it is not far-fetched to imagine thatEdison’s bold stroke to communicate with the dead was, in part, driven by hisneeding to one-up Tesla. At the time, Tesla was also developing a device tocommunicate with the dead; his was based on radio waves rather than a photonbeam. Tesla believed that waves of light, sound, or even thought were eternaland traveled through the entire universe. It would be Edison, however, whoconstructed the first prototype of a device to communicate with the dead. It washis final conquest and ultimate competitive victory.Tesla 101From the time he was a child in Croatia, Nikola Tesla displayed a gift for beingable to create images in his mind of devices that he wanted to design and thenuse those images as a building schematic or set of blueprints. Edison wasdifferent. With his concept for an electrical device at least lodged in the backof his mind, Edison would let it percolate until he figured out the steps tobuild it. And this worked for him, until he crossed paths with Nikola Tesla.As his primary industry expanded into commercial and industrial markets, Edisonhad to look at a serious professional challenge confronting him, one far moreserious than he could have first imagined. This was the challenge posed byNikola Tesla, whom he first met in 1884. Tesla’s theory of alternating currentgeneration was probably the most significant challenge to Edison’s domination ofthe municipal power and light-generating industry. And for a small-town,homegrown, up-by-the-bootstraps inventor like Edison, whose power-generatingstations in Manhattan were just getting under way from Pearl Street north, theappearance of Tesla in New York was a personal challenge as well as a businessand professional one.Edison was by all accounts a man who could hold grudges and translate a normalbusiness rivalry into a serious life-and-death personal competition. Edison wasjealous about the credit for his inventions, often taking the work of his labassistants and patenting it under his own name. Thus, when Tesla popped up onthe scene and refused to accept Edison’s dominance of the invention industry, ofthe municipal power-generating industry, Edison not only took offense; he struckback, and hard. Perhaps it was Tesla’s dashing appearance that first set Edisonoff. Or perhaps it was Tesla’s unbridled confidence in his own engineeringtheories. Or perhaps it was Tesla’s astounding ability to fix upon the design ofan instrument in his mind and then use that design, as if it were projected on ascreen, to recreate it on paper and then build it. Whatever it was, Edison andTesla were almost genetically destined to become rivals in business and in life.Who Was Nikola Tesla?It is not a stretch to say that one of the most eccentric, fascinating, andcomplex individuals in the life and times of Thomas Edison was an engineer andscientific genius named Nikola Tesla, the developer of alternating current.Decades before a US Supreme Court decision yanked away the patent for the radio,over the objections of Marconi, who had sued the United States over patentinfringement (Marconi Wireless Tel. Co. v. United States, 320 U.S. 1 [1943]),Tesla had competed against Edison in another area he had considered his own.A Serbian born in Croatia in 1856 to Greek Orthodox parents, Tesla lived a lifeof frustration, always fighting for his patents, always dealing with skepticalfinanciers, a one-time millionaire who ultimately lost it all. Despite hisgenius, he never received the attention Edison knew in his lifetime. Ironically,in what became known as his battle of the currents with his former employer andmentor Edison, it was Tesla who came out on top, and whose vision of electricaldistribution and supply is the one we use today. It was Tesla who most likelykept Edison pushing the envelope of new inventions and frontiers of knowledge,even as Edison reached old age. And it was Tesla’s journals about his attempt tocommunicate with the dead via radio that challenged Edison to develop his spiritphone.Tesla’s father was a Greek Orthodox clergyman living in one of the most troubledand violent regions of Europe. The battle lines had been drawn almost a thousandyears earlier between the Serbians and Kosovars, between Greek Orthodox andRoman Catholic, between Turks and Europeans, between Christianity and Islam.From this background, Nikola Tesla would become known also as the wizard of thetwentieth century, an iconic figure depicted as the mad scientist in film (hewas the cross between Flash Gordon’s Dr. Zarkoff and Emperor Ming theMerciless), cartoons (his image appeared in the “Betty Boop” series), and comicbooks.40 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-041]The young Tesla, like Edison, was driven by curiosity more than he was inhibitedby caution, a quality of his character that would mark him throughout his life.He was an explorer even as a school child, getting himself locked intoinhospitable places, finding himself falling into vats of milk, and evenexperimenting with flight. He once used an umbrella as a parachute to seewhether it could soften his fall when he jumped from a height. It didn’t, and hewas injured and confined to bed for almost two months.Tesla’s EducationTesla exercised his curiosity in books, principally books on mathematics andscience, especially physics. When he attended the Croatian version of highschool while living with his aunt, he saw his first modern machinery,specifically the steam engine. It was a wondrous sight for a young studentcompletely enthralled by the mathematics of compression, propulsion, and thetransmission of power. After suffering from a bout of cholera that laid him upfor two years, he decided to become a professor of mathematics and traveled tothe Polytechnic School in Austria. He also attended universities in Prague andBudapest, furthering his education in mathematics as well as in foreignlanguages.Support from his parents eventually lagged and Tesla was forced to find work tosupport himself. He became an assistant engineer for the government telegraphybureau, which enabled him to study the process of practical electricalengineering. However, his job, while it provided him with a salary, simply wasnot sufficient to sustain him or excite him. Tesla next turned his attention towhat he thought would become a valuable endeavor: inventions and the ownershipof patents. A patent for a device that people, specifically businesses, foundvaluable could eventually be used to get a steady income through licensing,something Edison had already figured out. But Tesla’s first inventions were notfor any designated business consumer market, and they brought him no fame orfortune. Less in desperation and more in hope, Tesla traveled to Paris and got ajob as an electrical engineer building power-generating plants. There he alsodiscovered that the center of scientific and electrical invention was not inEurope but in America, particularly in New York City under the auspices ofThomas Edison, whose inventions were changing the future right before his eyes.By 1887, Tesla had established his own enterprise, called the Tesla ElectricCompany. (Today a company by that name, headed by Elon Musk, is making electriccars and storage batteries; deve­loping a brain/computer interface calledNeuralink for the upload/download/storage of human memory; essentially creatingcybernetic organic hierarchical neural networks; and sending rockets intoearth’s orbit, then landing them on ocean-based platforms.)41[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-040] With his new company, Teslasoon constructed and patented his first motor for generating multiphasealternating current, which was purchased by the Westinghouse Electric Company inJuly 1888. Thus, Tesla was on his way to recognition as an inventor ofelectronics in America, especially when Westinghouse was able to sell his motorsfor a variety of industrial purposes. Tesla continued his research intoalternating current motors even after he no longer worked for the WestinghouseCompany, delving into other uses for high-frequency alternating-current motors.In an address to the IEEE in 1892, Tesla said, “Of the various branches ofelectrical investigation, perhaps the most interesting and immediately the mostpromising is that dealing with alternating currents. The progress in this branchof applied science has been so great in recent years that it justifies the mostsanguine hopes. Hardly have we become familiar with one fact, when novelexperiences are met with and new avenues of research are opened. Even at thishour possibilities not dreamed of before are, by the use of these currents,partly realized. As in nature all is ebb and tide, all is wave motion, so itseems that; in all branches of industry alternating currents—electric wavemotion—will have the sway.”42 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-039]One can only imagine Thomas Edison’s reaction to this prediction. It bluntlychallenged Edison’s own investment of his skills and business in direct currentelectrical motors, which he hoped would become the backbone of suppliers forwhat would become the twentieth-century municipal power grid.In many instances, Tesla’s abilities and inventions were nothing short ofextraordinary. His mind was given to inventions even when he was a boy. He wasonly nine years old when he built what he called a “sixteen-bug power motor” byfastening June bugs to a thin wooden wheel so as to propel the wheel into aprimitive drive mechanism. However, superseding all of his abilities, his uniquemental power was his paranormal visions. Throughout his life, “ideas flashedinto his mind as working units, complete to the final details of componentdesign and size.”43 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-038]Edison’s and Tesla’s Different Educational BackgroundsUnlike Edison, who had little formal education outside of homeschooling by hismother, Tesla had substantial schooling in mathe­matics, physics, and mechanics,and he later studied philosophy at the University of Prague, in the capital cityof the Czech Republic. In 1881, Tesla began his career as an inventor inBudapest, Hungary, where he mainly worked in engineering for the BudapestTelephone Exchange. There he devised an apparatus called the “telephonerepeater,” an invention akin to today’s loudspeaker. But Tesla, who had followedEdison’s work, had a desire to work for him and share with him his idea foralternating current. In 1884, he moved to the United States and settled in NewYork City, eventually becoming a naturalized American citizen.Tesla later credited his mother for encouraging his inclination towardinventions. She’d invented different types of kitchen utensils and wasinnovative in coming up with solutions to household problems. What’s more, herancestors were also inventors.In 1863, the Tesla family was beset by tragedy when Nikola’s older brother,Dane, was thrown from a horse and later died of his injuries. Nikola was onlyseven at the time. The Teslas were inconsolable in their grief and languishedover the loss of their eldest son.44 From then on, Nikola received little praiseor attention from his parents. As a result, Tesla revealed that he had littleconfidence in himself growing up, something he overcompensated for later inlife. Once, as a lonely child, he ran away from home.Sometimes Tesla awoke in the middle of the night after nightmares of Dane’sdeath, to which he said he’d borne witness with his own eyes, and of thefuneral. No matter how hard he tried to avoid the visions, he was unable toerase them. “I was oppressed by thoughts of pain in life and death and religiousfear… swayed by superstitious beliefs, and lived in constant dread of the spiritof evil, of ghosts and other unholy monsters of the dark,” he wrote in hisjournal.44 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-037]Tesla and the ParanormalThere has long been considerable controversy about Tesla’s visions and othertypes of paranormal events. Skeptics and traditional scientists have worked hardto find earthly rather than supernatural explanations for Tesla’s visions andout-of-body experiences, often to no avail. It appears that no criticism ordismissal of Tesla’s psychic encounters could alter his paranormal “gifts.” Onthe other hand, Tesla always had his followers, those who were unshakable intheir faith that he was telling the truth about his preternatural ormetaphysical involvement. Ironically, Tesla’s harshest critic about the occultand related topics was Tesla himself. He did not want to admit to his visions orother paranormal encounters for fear that he’d be ridiculed or associated withfraudulent mediums, of which there were many. We should remember that throughoutthe centuries, many scientists were interested in or at least curious aboutpsychic phenomena and metaphysics. Many scientists studied, read, andcontemplated the occult, often without reaching any conclusions about itsorigins or nature.Tesla Arrives in New YorkTesla arrived in New York by ship in 1884. He was twenty-eight years old, talland slender, with a lean, youthful face and a mustache. Tesla first met Edison’sclosest associate, Charles Batchelor, who introduced him to Edison via a letter.Meeting with the “Wizard of Menlo Park” was a thrill for Tesla, who had beenanxious to meet him ever since he was a teenager. The result was that for nearlya year Nikola Tesla worked for Edison, who was initially impressed by Tesla’sintelligence, skill, and ability to solve engineering problems.The two men could not have had more different appearances. Edison, about fivefeet nine inches tall, did not appear to pay much attention to style. His darksuit was typically rumpled; his white hair, as he grew older, was seldom styled.On the other hand, Tesla, over six feet tall, cut an attractive, well-dressed,and even dashing, figure. When he was a young man, his dark hair and neatlytrimmed mustache seemed to match his penetrating eyes and angular features.After he became a cult hero to many Americans in the 1930s, Tesla wascaricatured in film in the Flash Gordon serials both as Dr. Zarkoff and EmperorMing the Merciless of Mongo, who aimed his death ray at the Earth. Tesla-typemad scientists have also turned up as cartoon characters in comics and graphicnovels. Today’s stereotype of the mad scientist is still based on the popularconception of Nikola Tesla.Edison and Tesla were also as different as different could be in terms of theirtemperament and method of approach to design and invention. Tesla was avisionary who, in an intuitive blink of insight, could solve problems almostinstantly, while Edison depended on experiments that focused on trial and error.While Tesla spoke several languages, Edison was not as well-traveled as thebrilliant Serbian. Tesla was impatient and, as some called him, “high strung.”Edison, however, was the cleverer inventor and marketing expert, not onlybecause he understood his market, but also because he had experience inpractical inventions from the time he was a child.AC versus DCWhen Tesla got his opportunity to meet Edison, he hoped to convince him thatalternating current (AC) was superior to direct current (DC). Edison’s directcurrent generation had become the standard for American electric powerdistribution by the late nineteenth century, essentially because it was the onlytype of electrical generation available. But Tesla, maybe naively, thought hecould convince Edison to change all that. Tesla had been working on an AC motorthat he promised would be better than Edison’s DC version because it was moreefficient and generated a more powerful electrical supply across a distance. Itgenerated at a higher frequency than direct current and it had a greaterpotential, the result of moving the charge closer to a like charge and then awayfrom that like charge. The result is that there was greater potential energywhich, Tesla showed, meant that the current in a circuit could travel a longerdistance without significantly degrading. That made it superior todirect-current generation, which required multiple sites of amplification andregeneration.But this was a challenge that Edison was not prepared to accept, believing thathis direct-current generators were not only more reliable, but were better able,through a system of substation relays, to deliver electricity at a lower, andsafer, voltage. Besides, Edison had already invested heavily in direct current,had built an infrastructure, and was not about to throw out what he had beenworking on for over a decade. Edison was, by this point, the corporateindustrialist protecting his technology.Because Edison had no interest in Tesla’s plan for alternating current, whatbegan became known as the “War of the Currents,” contested by Edison’s GeneralElectric Company and Tesla’s George Westinghouse. Edison would stubbornly holdon to direct current, while Tesla did all but plead for alternating current.Because direct current travels in only one direction, it is limi­ted to roughlya square mile from the power plant, after which it drops off considerably.Alternating current, on the other hand, constantly reverses its direction,thereby providing the electrical supplier a much greater range. Edison’searliest power-generating station was on Pearl Street in what today is lowerManhattan. But it only serviced a small area. Therefore, a city as large as NewYork, even in the 1890s, would have required a power-generating stationsupplying direct current in every neighborhood, a highly expensive propositionnot only in terms of building costs, but in terms of the amount of real estaterequired. Worse, direct current also meant that supplying rural areas withelectricity would be almost impossible. Those rich enough to afford it couldlicense from Edison the right to construct their own local power plant, also aformidable obstacle to a nationwide power grid. Alternating current is notrestricted by such boundaries and can be conducted affor­dably over larger areasbecause it has greater potential (power) than direct current.Why did Edison obstinately refuse to consider alternating current? By embracingTesla’s AC, he could have revolutionized the business of municipal power supplydecades before it was adopted. But he either truly believed that direct currentwas better or he could not bring himself to admit that he was wrong. It was nosecret that Edison was stubborn and found it difficult to change his mind oncehe became committed to something.While Tesla was employed by Edison, at a relatively small salary, the Wizard ofMenlo Park promised Tesla $50,000 if he could overhaul the jumbo generators atthe Edison plant on Pearl Street in Manhattan. Tesla completed the worksatisfactorily, but when he asked Edison for the money he was promised, he wasturned down. Edison told Tesla he’d been joking when he made the offer, butTesla did not see the humor. Furious, Tesla quit working for Edison’s company.Not long after, Tesla came to the attention of another entrepreneur andinventor, George Westinghouse, who had developed the railroad air brake.Westinghouse hoped to develop a competing power system, but soon realized Edisonhad the market cornered on direct current. Instead Westinghouse turned to AC,the system Tesla hoped to see put in practice. Edison called Westinghouse“crazy” and Tesla “impractical.”When his first electrical system was implemented in the town of GreatBarrington, Massachusetts, Westinghouse employed a large and skilled sales forceto encourage residents and businesses to replace gas with AC. Edison’s directcurrent did not sell as well. Each company, Edison and Westinghouse, touted itsservice as the best, just as Edison had previously maintained that electri­cityin one’s home, office, or factory was safer than using gas to light a room orbuilding. In time, electricity all but replaced gaslight around the world. Andbecause of Westinghouse’s marketing skills and ability to demonstrate thefinancial benefits of AC versus DC, alternating current came to be seen as moreefficient in the battle of the currents. But Edison was not a man to be trifledwith and would not take impending defeat in a sportsmanlike manner.The battle of the currents became so heated that Edison proposed using theTesla/Westinghouse AC motors to create the electric chair. This, at a time whenNew York State was looking to replace hanging and find a more humane way toexecute its condemned prisoners. This was not an idea wholly conceived byEdison, because news reports had carried stories of people who had becomeelectrocuted by touching the hot AC wires bringing current to railroad trains.Thus, AC was known to be dangerous. But just how dangerous would be ademonstration that Edison believed would turn the world away from AC and towardshis DC generators.The Electric ChairEdison next hired Harold Pitney Brown to build a device that would prove that ACwas more dangerous than DC. To test the device, Edison began experimenting byjolting animals with lethally high current. In fact, his Menlo Park inventionlaboratory soon became an execution chamber where rodents, shelter dogs destinedto be euthanized, and even a circus elephant were electrocuted by alternatingcurrent. At this point, Edison knew it could be done. All that remained was toconstruct a chair, which was the job assigned to Harold Brown. Of course, Edisonwas not really looking for a more humane way to execute prisoners. He was reallylooking for a way to demonstrate that AC was much more dangerous than DC.To do this, after Brown had constructed the chair, Edison bought and installedWestinghouse AC motors in New York’s Auburn Prison where convicted killerWilliam Kemmler was waiting on death row for his execution. George Westinghousehimself sought to intervene in the first execution, claiming that using electriccurrent to kill a human being was not only painful but inhumane punishment and aviolation of the Eighth Amendment. Edison prevailed despite Westinghouse’sprotestations. Then, in a scene that might have come right out of the motionpicture The Green Mile, when the condemned William Kemmler was seated in thechair and the current turned on, he convulsed violently with tremors as thesearing voltage passed through him, creating sparks and smoke. He did not dieimmediately, so the current had to be applied again, at which point Kemmler’sheart stopped and he was declared dead. Edison had made his point. The executionwas such a gruesome event that the newspapers reporting it said that Kemmler hadbeen “Westinghoused.” That was the length to which Edison went in order to winthe battle of the currents, a battle he ultimately lost.Edison was being disingenuous in his criticism of Tesla’s alternating current.Not only did Tesla understand that the high frequency and potential of AC wasdeadly when carried by heavy supply lines, he also understood how to step downthe voltage when it was transmitted to private homes and businesses. To do this,Tesla patented his transformer (US Patent Office number 593,138, dated November2, 1897), a mechanism that reduced voltage going to a residence so that it wouldbe safe in case someone came in direct contact with it. Tesla’s transformer madeAC current safe even though Edison claimed that it was lethally dangerous.Tesla’s Inventions for the FutureTesla moved forward to invent new machines and instruments, focusing hisattention on ways to eliminate the expensive and cumbersome cables and overheadwires. He invented the wireless transmission of electricity and a turbine-likedevice that generated very high frequency current. He invented what today isknown as the Tesla coil, a transformer circuit used to produce high-voltage,low-current, high-frequency AC electricity. It not only could produce greatpower, but had what Tesla claimed was “intelligence.” Movie fans may rememberTesla coils harnessing and amplifying lightning to give life through electricityto Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney, Jr., actors who both portrayed the Frankensteinmonster during the 1930s and ’40s. In a May 1899 interview Tesla gave to PearsonMagazine, he tried to explain an invention that would harness the sun’s power todrive a generator that would produce AC. As Tesla explained it:This is the experimental model of the apparatus with which I hope someday to soharness the rays of the sun that that heavenly body will operate every machinein our factories, propel every train and carriage in our streets, and do all thecooking in our homes, as well as furnish all the light that man may need bynight as well as by day. It will, in short, replace all wood and coal as aproducer of motive power and heat and electric lighting.45[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-036]This idea of converting sunlight into steam so as to drive gene­rators was anamazing concept for its time. Even though it was, as Tesla’s intervieweradmitted, a bold idea, it was such a simple concept that even lay people,non-engineering types, and schoolchildren could understand it. It consists ofconcentrating and amplifying the heat of the sun on one spot (the glasscylinder) by the series of complicated mirrors and magnifying glasses until theresulting heat is most intense.“This manufactured heat is directed upon the cylinder filled with waterchemically prepared so that in a short time the water has evaporated into steamand has passed from the cylinder through a pipe and into another chamber. In thelatter place, this sun-made steam piped into a regular steam engine of ordinaryconstruction, the horse-power of which will be determined by the size of theapparatus by which the sun generates steam in that spot. This steam engine isused to generate electricity. And this electricity can be either used at once orelse stored up in storage batteries to be used on days when there is nosunlight.”46 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-035]You can imagine what the impact of Tesla’s sunlight conversion idea would havebeen for the twentieth century. By 1900, coal was the principal fuel for thesteam engines that drove electric turbines. By the 1950s, oil and then naturalgas became the principal fuels, and then, for a time, nuclear power. Today, ourcoal reserves are running out and hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” fornatural gas provides a much cheaper and efficient way to generate fuel, albeitnot without its own carbon overhead. With the exception of nuclear power, which,of course, presents its own liabilities, coal, oil, and gas are all pollutants.But converting the sun’s rays, via a system of mirrors, into a heat source toheat water to steam to drive turbines would have transformed the twentiethcentury from generating greenhouse gases to having almost pollution-freeelectric generators. In addition, since a solar-generating plant does not relyon the purchase of fuel, the cost of electricity would have been remarkably low.It conceivably could have transformed society and brought power to Third Worldcountries in such a way that the politics of oil might have never destabilizedmuch of the world.As Tesla prophesied, “In this way electricity will be so cheapened, that it willbe possible for the poorest factory-owner to use it as a power at a smaller costthan steam. Electricity will in this way supplant steam as a motive power on allrailways and—in the shape of storage batteries—on all water vessels. And thehumblest citizen will profit by the new system of producing electricity; for hecan have it in his home to do all his cooking and lighting and heating. And itwill be even cheaper for him than coal, wood, or petroleum.”47[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-034]When one looks at Tesla’s prediction in the face of what was driving Edison’sbusinesses, it’s clear to see how that challenged the very industrial modelEdison had spent years trying to build. Not only would this have been a terribleblow to Edison’s ego, that a foreign-born eccentric engineer could supplant him,but given the next-to-nothing cost of generating solar power, it would havedriven his power-generating companies out of business. Thus, by the beginning ofthe twentieth century, Edison and Tesla were rivals for the heart and soul ofAmerica’s power and fuel industries. It is no stretch of the imagination to seewhy Edison would have gone to such great lengths to debunk not only the theoryof alternating current, but to debunk Tesla as a man of science.Hydroelectric Power and Wireless ElectricityExploiting solar power to convert amplified heat into electricity would not bethe last topic over which Tesla and Edison would clash regarding free versusmetered energy. The next conflict would come to a head when Tesla sought to beamenergy wirelessly to power cities, thus eliminating the need for a hard-wiredpower grid. In the immediate aftermath of his experiments with solar power,however, Tesla turned to water-driven turbines to generate electri­city. And heused the power of Niagara Falls.One of Tesla’s most amazing triumphs was to harness the tremendous force ofNiagara Falls, whose water power he used to drive a hydroelectric generator. Hewas so successful in this that in 1895 Westinghouse built a gigantichydroelectric plant, employing Tesla’s alternating current system. This was alsoa blow to Edison’s investment in delivering direct current to homes andbusinesses. The irony of the Tesla and Edison feud is that it spread to the twocompanies, Westinghouse and General Electric. More ironic is that Westinghousebecame part of the Viacom/Paramount organization, a CBS corporate conglomerate,while GE wound up being a part of the Universal/NBC conglomerate. In a sense,the Tesla and Edison rivalry stretched across the centuries, as the televisionnetworks battled over ratings and the studios vied for theater goers.The Chicago World’s FairPerhaps the most serious dispute in the war of the currents between Edison andTesla came to a head at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. The exposition, whichcommemorated the 400th anniversary of Columbus’s discovery of the New World, hadlet out bids for building the lighting and power system. It was not only apotentially lucrative contract; the importance of the exposition was such thatwhoever won the contract would have had a proof of concept design andimplementation to show off to the world. How could other cities, industrialcampuses, and local municipalities looking to supply power and light to theirresidents fail to be impressed by any display at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair?Both General Electric and Westinghouse sought to win the contract to light thefair and put in competing bids although Edison, with J.P. Morgan investing andGeneral Electric contracting, did not know there were any competitors. Perhapsthinking that they were all alone in the bidding and maybe even thinking thatonly they had the technology to install the power supply, General Electric putin a bid for $1.8 million. Maybe they were confident that even if the bid wereconsidered slightly too high, they would have room to negotiate down, given thatthey probably overestimated their own costs. The bid was rejected by thecontracting agency and GE was forced back to the accounting sheets. They sooncame back with a counteroffer, a bid of approximately $550,000. Now they werecertain of winning the contract. Who could turn that down?It might have been a good bid for General Electric had they been the solebidder. But they did not know that Westinghouse had also assembled a proposal tolight the fair at a price even lower than GE’s, at just under $400,000,Westinghouse said they could light the entire fair, beating General Electric by$150,000. Using Tesla’s AC technology, Westinghouse proceeded to successfullylight the fair and, in so doing, demonstrated that alternating current could beused in municipalities across the nation. Alternating current eventually becamethe power grid for America.Tesla, the Court-Designated Inventorof Radio Transmission?Tesla also experimented with “electromagnetic waves” that were the foundation ofradio. In fact, although Marconi is reputed to have generated the first radiosignals across the Atlantic, Tesla claimed that he was the first to invent thewireless transmission of radio waves. That claim eventually went to the UnitedStates Patent Office and ultimately to the United States Supreme Court. Thebattle between Tesla and Marconi seemed to have been resolved by the patentoffice, which awarded the patent to Marconi, but Tesla maintained his challengein the courts. Then, at the outset of World War I, Marconi sued the UnitedStates government for a patent infringement because the US was using radiotransmissions for military communications. This did not sit well with themilitary and they supported Tesla’s claim in court for the patent for radiotransmission. In 1943 the Supreme Court extinguished Marconi’s claim for patentinfringement and his claims for royalties. In Marconi Wireless Tel. Co. v.United States, 320 U.S. 1 (1943), the court held, “The broad claims of theMarconi Patent No. 763,772, for improvements in apparatus for wirelesstelegraphy—briefly, for a structure and arrangement of four high-frequencycircuits with means of independently adjusting each so that all four may bebrought into electrical resonance with one another—held invalid becauseanticipated.” Tesla never had a chance to celebrate his victory, having passedaway six months earlier.Ironically, it was Edison’s company, General Electric, which had acquired therights to Marconi’s radio patent. They in turn had exploited it in the creationof their motion picture company, Radio Corporation of America, or RKO, owned inpart by Joseph P. Kennedy, JFK’s father, who was instrumental in using Edison’sand Marconi’s technology to develop one of the first studios to make talkingpictures. Marconi’s employee, David Sarnoff, worked on wiring the first RKOstudios with sound before he founded the National Broadcasting Company, now apart of Universal, General Electric, and Comcast. When the Court ruled againstMarconi, it was as if Tesla had defeated Edison again. Thus, in popular loretoday, it is Tesla who prevailed as a matter of law even if not of science,defeating not only Marconi, but Edison and Joe Kennedy.Tesla and Remote Radio ControlAccording to author Margaret Cheney, Tesla also had a grasp of the underlyingtheories of generating X-rays, of the electron microscope, and of usingradio-controlled devices with torpedoes and even missiles.48[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-033] It may seem strange, whenconsidering the nature of Tesla’s far-ranging inventions, that although he didnot seem to understand the science of his visionary experiences, there was noquestion that he had an abundance of accurate paranormal visions.Tesla wrote in his diary, “During my boyhood I had suffered from a peculiaraffliction due to the appearance of images, which were often accompanied bystrong flashes of light. . . . Then I began to take mental excursions. . . .“This I did constantly until I was seventeen, when my thoughts turned seriouslyto invention. Then I found I could visualize with the greatest facility.” Teslawent on to explain how he did not need to concentrate, he could simply visualizea future invention. “The inventions I have conceived in this way have alwaysworked. In thirty years there has not been a single exception,” he wrote.“Before I put a sketch on paper, the whole is worked out mentally.”49[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-032]Tesla also claimed that he had discovered “an inexhaustible source of energythat could be transmitted anywhere in the world without wires or loss of power.”He accurately predicted the future, stating that someday “it will possible fornations to fight without armies or guns . . . with weapons far more terrible.”Tesla discovered a “protective radiation principle,” popularly called a “deathray.”50 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-031]Tesla and Extraterrestrial LifeArguably, Tesla’s most controversial area of interest was in extraterrestriallife, an area where he also competed with Edison. During 1895 and 1896, heconsidered that there might be life on other planets. He wrote, “If there areintelligent inhabitants of Mars or any other planet, it seems to me that we cando something to attract their attention. . . .”51[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-030]He also delved into the language of Theosophy or Hindu metaphysics. Tesla’sstates of higher consciousness achieved by “intense concentration and a celibatelife” seem like the Hindu ideas of cosmic energy in the universe. It alsosuggests that Tesla read or studied the writings of Madame Helena PetrovnaBlavatsky, the founder of Theosophy. He also had a rudimentary knowledge of theVedic texts, which describe the Hindu deities battling each other from flyingsaucer-type devices and firing death rays at each other.Tesla also theorized the principles of what he called “wireless telegraphy,”essentially radio, and “visual wireless telegraphy,” television. The way hedescribed it was through the analogy of a balloon filled with water withpiston-like devices at both ends. Suppose, Tesla said, that at one end of thewater-filled balloon, you pressed a piston into the liquid so as to expand thebag, while at the other end a piston withdrew the expanded liquid andtransmitted it. Now imagine that the Earth’s atmosphere is the balloon and atransmitter, say a telephone device, is at one end and a movie-like screen is atthe other end. What you transmit, visual and audio signals through thetelephone, now come out the other end. In essence, not only was Tesla describingwhat would become television, he was also describing what would become todayFaceTime and Skype.The Tesla Wireless GridIn the Sunday edition of the New York Journal on August 8, 1897, reporter JuliusChambers described an interview with Tesla in which the inventor explained howhe would be able to draw current from existing hydroelectric generators, amplifythat current to higher frequencies and potentials, and then broadcast thatcurrent wirelessly to receiving stations around the world for sub distribution.This was Tesla’s vision of free electrical power, something that would havedirectly challenged the Edison General Electric model of metered electricalsupply for which customers would pay a monthly fee. This is the model in usetoday for municipal power suppliers. Ironically, Tesla’s idea of free energydistribution also posed a direct challenge to his former investor, GeorgeWestinghouse, who financed Tesla’s alternating current distribution system.As early as 1890, even before he constructed his Wardenclyffe tower in Shoreham,New York, Tesla explained his invention of wireless transmission to hisinterviewer at Pearson magazine. He said that just as easy as it was to transmitelectrical power via cables strung about on poles, imagine if the Earth itselfwere the cable and that all the construction expense of building the grid wereeliminated. Imagine if power generating and transmitting stations could beconstructed near every hydroelectric facility. Think of the cost savings, thinkof simply using the Earth’s own natural resources instead of manufactured linesand relays. Simply speaking, the atmosphere takes the place of the cables, withthe electrical signal, the flow of electrons, traveling freely through the air.Tesla conceived an array of towers around the country from which he wouldsuspend balloons high in the atmosphere. The balloons would act as transmittersin the rarified atmosphere, where signals would be transmitted with much lessresistance. As for receiving stations, Tesla proposed to erect the samestructures with the balloons equipped with devices to absorb the free-floatingelectrical signals, then transmitting them down though the towers via cables. Asystem of wires and cables, Tesla told his interviewer, would convey the powersupply locally. Thus, imagine a grid much like Edison’s with the exception thatthe atmosphere would replace the long cable supply lines, with local stationsreceiving antennae.Tesla was passionate about his discoveries into the realm of wirelesstransmission, claiming that he had harnessed the power of the Earth’smagnetosphere as the distribution mechanism. He claimed that by projecting awireless beam of electrons, literally a particle beam weapon well ahead of itstime, at any form of receiving station, that beam would power that station.Hence, he could even light ships at sea, far from land, simply by directing hisbeam in that direction. In fact, Tesla said, his particle-beam distributionsystem was so powerful that he could project an electrical disturbance towardMars and, assuming there were life forms on distant planets capable of receivinghis particle beams, he could communicate with them. Thus, by the beginning ofthe twentieth century, Tesla claimed that he had invented a form of wirelessdistribution that was, we know now, one hundred years ahead of its time.Tesla refined his idea by 1911, telling the New York Herald that his plan wasnothing less than turning the entire planet into a giant worldwide dynamo ofelectrical generating power.52 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-029]Of course, his Tesla towers sparked and crackled, he said, transmitting a formof lightning through the air. And, yes, this was very high current, higher thanthe high-volume main electrical supply trunk like those we see today hangingfrom power poles across rural America. It was dangerous, and in some areas ofgovernment there were complaints that a misdirected wireless strike might havethe same effect as the electric chair.The main transmission tower was erected in 1897 in Shoreham, Long Island, in NewYork State, with the goal of transmitting power across the Atlantic. It had beenfinanced, ironically, by J. P. Morgan, who believed he could monetize wirelesstransmission. But the tower also served as the proof of concept that signalscould be transmitted without wires. While the dispute over Tesla’s and Marconi’srights to patents would surface in court prior to the US entry into World War Iand again in World War II, the United States military was also wary about thetower. The military believed that German agents might try to use the tower totransmit information about the American military presence in the Atlantic. Infact, the military informed the press that they had seen “suspicious”individuals surveying the tower property, and believed them to be German spies.Because of these concerns, the military blew up the base of the tower, whichthen collapsed. During World War I, German naval vessels had deposited spies onthe eastern edge of Long Island, near Montauk, and the spies had made their waywest toward New York City. They were eventually captured and held by federalagents and the military.Newspapers at the time reported that Tesla was regarded as a genius, albeit aneccentric scientist, by the American public. The public, while wary of lightningstrikes on power-receiving stations, was also excited by Tesla’s promise ofunlimited power transmitted through the air. By the outset of World War I, Teslahad become a symbol of American inventiveness, even more so than Edison, thepractical man of science. While Edison was making motion pictures forentertainment, improving the telephone for mass communication, and working inthe financial services and stock trading industries, Tesla was building deathrays and particle-beam transmitters that, he said, would enable people on earthto talk to life forms on other planets. This was not just a contrast of ideas,it was a contrast of cultures and belief systems. But, we argue, there is noquestion that the Edison–Tesla rivalry must have prompted Edison to explore newventures at the envelope of the consumer market.Tesla’s demonstration of the efficacy of wireless transmission, not just ofradio waves, but of electrical power itself, meant he had managed to controlparticles—electrons—which, because of their collective charge, seemed to havesome cohesiveness. Just three years after the destruction of Tesla’s Long Islandtower, Edison ventured into the same area of receiving wireless transmission,only this time not from radio or power transmitters, but from free-floatingbundles of what he called “life units.” These were electrically chargedparticles that he believed might carry the sentience that was embo­died in theirhuman form. This was the underlying premise of his spirit phone, that it coulddetect electrically charged life units. And there was no question that hisrivalry with Tesla is what inspired Edison to make one last invention, this timeinto the world of the spirits and the departed, a place that Tesla had alreadyvisited—if not in person, then in books.Tesla’s Later YearsNikola Tesla was eccentric as well as remarkably psychic and highlyintelligent—so intelligent, in fact that he was awarded the Nobel Prize inphysics in 1912. He turned it down because it would have to be shared with hisbitter rival Thomas Edison. The award went instead to Swedish scientist NilsGustaf Dalén.Tesla fell in love only once in his life, and that was when he was a young man.When the relationship did not work out, he never again became seriously orromantically involved, nor did he ever marry. He lived in solitude with his ownthoughts and his own inventions and, some said, devolved into a form ofsolipsistic dementia.In his last years, Tesla lived alone in the New Yorker hotel in a single room invirtual poverty, an ironic twist of fate for a man in whose work financiers likeWestinghouse and J. P. Morgan had invested millions. It was a sad end to abrilliant man’s life and career. Shortly after his death in January 1943, FBIagents opened a safe in Tesla’s room and carted away its contents. One theory isthat govern­ment operatives took papers that some think held details of a“secret invention” that may have been useful in warfare. They took the notes ofTesla’s secret invention, plans and schematics for which the Soviet Union hadawarded him a deve­lopment grant, and turned them over to General Nathan Twiningat Wright Field, Ohio. There, just four years after Tesla’s death, the debriswas taken from a crash near Roswell, New Mexico. Visitors to the scene,including President Harry Truman, described the craft as extraterrestrial, andstated that the alien life forms that navigated it were also taken to Twining’sAir Materiél command for analysis. What was Tesla’s collection of notes on hisplans for a secret weapon? It was antigravity, the very mechanism that seems tohave allowed the Roswell flying saucer to skip through the atmosphere with noapparent traditional form of propulsion.In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in Tesla with all hiscomplexities and peculiarities. Perhaps he will finally get the recognition hehas largely been denied."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12EDISON, TESLA, ROBOTS, AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEBoth Edison and Tesla had arti­culated exotic and unconventional theories aboutartificial intelligence. Edison’s belief (shared with Tesla) that everything wasalive helped form the basis of his theories for the development of the spiritphone. Edison wrote extensively about what he termed “life units,” primaryelements of life, particles of electrical energy, which were the basis of allexistence. Even things that seemed inorganic, such as rocks, were infused withlife units that gave them substance. In this regard, Edison quite prescientlyforesaw the modern theories of Gaia, the living Earth. Edison was giving atechnological explanation to what primitive people said was living nature, aworld motivated by deities that were responsible for how things came into being.This may seem strange for a man who was imbued with devout Methodist beliefs,but Edison was remarkable in that he had the ability to assimilate differentstrands of thought and belief, faith and science, into an aggregate vision ofworking reality. This was how he managed to combine scientific theory andspiritualism into a design and process for his spirit phone.Edison’s theories of intelligence abstracted from human form diverged fromtraditional theories of existence in the way life units organized themselves.Edison believed that if these electrically charged units existed after the deathof the body, they would be attracted to each other—a precursor to Einstein’stheories of quantum entanglement and spooky action at a distance—in such a wayas to operate with a form of abstract intelligence. This intelligence, Edisonbelieved, could be identified and pinged by a device that registered thesefloating but cohesive life units.Modern Quantum Theory and Edison’s Theories of ConsciousnessIt has taken almost one hundred years, but theoretical physicist Sir RogerPenrose, basing his argument in part on near-death experiences, has argued thatthe microtubules in human cells can exist after the death of the body as quantuminformation. They exist as separate, but cohesive, units apart from the body,entangled with each other according to Einstein’s theory of spooky attraction ata distance. Just as Edison predicted, Penrose argues that the cohesive quantumunits remain entangled, providing a form of consciousness.53[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-028] They can even return to thebody cells if the body itself comes back to life. This, he argues, is his proofof existence at a quantum conscious level after the body’s death. In thistheory, Penrose is supported by physicists at the Max Planck Institute forPhysics in Munich.Tesla’s TheoriesTesla went a step further than Edison. Like Edison, he believed that allexistence, organic and inorganic, is imbued with life. He based his theory onwhat he stated as a fact that everything we see around us is capable ofresponding to irritant stimuli. According to Tesla, as quoted in the New YorkAmerican on February 7, 1915, “Even matter called inorganic, believed to bedead, responds to irritants and gives unmistakable evidence of a livingprinciple within. Everything that exists, organic or inorganic, animated orinert, is susceptible to stimulus from the outside.” Moreover, possibly becausehe believed that even the inanimate was alive, he believed that he could provideobjects that were inanimate with a kind of self-directed consciousness. In otherwords, he could devise an automaton that would act of its own volition to followinstructions given to it by human beings.Tesla’s theories were truly advanced. In an imaginary interview written by MarcJ. Seifer and Michael Behar in the October 1998, issue of Wired Magazine, basedon Tesla’s own words, Tesla says, “My plan was to construct an automaton whichwould have its ‘own mind,’ and by this I mean it would be able, independent ofany operator, in response to external influences affecting its sensitive organs,to perform a great variety of acts and operations as if it had intelligence. Itwill be able to obey orders given far in advance, it will be capable ofdistinguishing between what it ought and ought not to do and of recordingimpressions which will definitely affect its subsequent actions. Further I donot believe that intelligence is artificial, but rather a property of matter.”Even before the 1921 performance of Karel Čapek’s RUR, Tesla had conceived ofdevices that could be instructed to perform certain tasks and use internal logicto make decisions based on programmed instructions. He designed weapons such asrobotic ships and torpedoes that could distinguish between friend and foe basedupon precisely formulated algorithms and then make the appropriate tacticalmoves. He said, “I conceived the idea of constructing such a machine, whichwould mechanically represent me and which would respond as I do myself, but ofcourse in a much more primitive manner, to external influences. Whether theautomaton be of flesh and bone, or wood and steel, it mattered little, providedit could undertake all the duties required of it like an intelligent being. Withmachines to do the work, man will be that much more free to increase hisknowledge and productivity and thereby advance the planet.”54[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-027]Even as early as the turn of the century, Tesla’s theories of artificialintelligence were challenging both the religious and cultural trends of thetime. Like most of Tesla’s theories, including wireless transmission and usingsolar power as a fuel to generate electricity, his theories of artificialintelligence or AI have not only come to be, but are engendering scrutiny fromthe people at the heart of its development. Scientists and product developerssuch as physicist Stephen Hawking, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Tesla Motorsproject leader Elon Musk, and computer scientist Ray Kurzweil, all of whom havepredicted the ultimate creation of an artificially intelligent machine, havegiven dire warnings about the dark side of AI, in particular how an AI machinewill deal with humanity. For example, according to Christopher Mims in the WallStreet Journal (June 25, 2017), within ten years, an AI incarnation of Apple’sSiri will not only will replace the smartphone as we know it, but will beintegrated into the glasses and clothing we wear and devices in our ears andwill adapt itself to our own personalities and proclivities on aminute-by-minute basis.The issue of the relationship between an artificially intelligent robot andhuman beings was raised by Isaac Asimov in the science fiction universe hecreated in his series I, Robot, in which he stated the fundamental laws ofrobotics (a word he created), which, verbatim, were: “(1) A robot may not injurea human being or, (2) through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. And(3) a robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orderswould conflict with the First Law, and a robot must protect its own existence aslong as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.”55[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-026] Actually these three laws werefirst articulated in the Asimov 1942 short story Runaround, published in themagazine Astounding Science Fiction and republished eight years later in I,Robot. In its modern incarnations, these laws of robotics were again promulgatedin the science fiction movie Forbidden Planet (1956) and in the personificationof the Star Trek: The Next Generation android “Data.”Westworld and the Origin of Artificial Consciousness in the Robotic BrainAuthor Michael Crichton’s Westworld took the distinction between artificiallyintelligent robots and humans to a new level when the robots become resistant totheir programming.56 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-025] After theWestworld feature film, which Michael Crichton directed, came the HBO televisionseries Westworld by TV producer J. J. Abrams. These storylines revolved aroundthe birth of consciousness in androids after a rogue designer inserted thepropensity for memories to feed into their reactions to their daily experiencesand carry over from one programmed story line to the next. As a result, thebleed from memories of prior relationships, of suffering at the hands of others,or of death, albeit artificial, informs their processing of sensory inputs, thusrendering them susceptible to human reactions and not just pre-programmedresponses.The philosophy behind Abrams’s incarnation of Michael Crichton’s Westworld isbased in part upon the important work of the late Princeton psychologistProfessor Julian Jaynes, whose theses are embodied in his seminal work TheOrigin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.57[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-024] In this, he argued that what wecall self-awareness was the result of messaging from the subordinate hemisphereof the brain to the dominant hemisphere, albeit that the messaging itself wasbeneath the level of conscious awareness. It wasn’t until the actual formationof the hardwired nature of language, communicated between the hemispheresthrough the bundle of neurons known as the corpus callosum, that the brainbecame asymmetrical and the formation of logic and language began.It was this force-feeding of the conscious by the subordinate conscious thatinspired Freud’s construct of the way memories and emotions operate on theconscious mind, and what the CIA experimented with in Canada in the 1950s underits MK-ULTRA program. As related in Chapter 7, they were doing it to uncover thememories of deep cover programmed Soviet spies sent into the US with falseAmerican identities after World War II and the Korean War. Modern popularpsychology titles from the end of the last century, such as Eric Berne’s TheGames People Play and Dr. Thomas A. Harris’s I’m OK, You’re OK, came out of thisprogram from the US government’s sponsored research of physicians WilderPenfield and Ewan Cameron, both CIA contractors in Canada.Their work, although originally intended to uncover the existence of Communistspies and saboteurs during the Cold War, gave psychologists new insights intohuman motivations and the nature of sentience and consciousness. This was at thevery dawn of the age of computers, whose programmers sought to mimic the humancondition through artificial intelligence and algorithms that can set in motiona form of self-determination. This was one of the themes of Westworld.The Promise and the Threat of AIThe rules of robotics notwithstanding, the reality is much starker when werealize that not only are military scientists and weapons developers finallyexploring Tesla’s theories of robotic soldiers, even if these soldiers existonly in computers as aggregations of electrons absent physical bodies. Forexample, in Joel Achenbach’s December 27, 2015, article in the Washington Post,he poses a question that perplexes futurists dealing with advanced computerintelligence technologies: “What would happen to humanity if AI machines areallowed to self-develop?” Futurist Charles Ostman, who has appeared onlate-night radio talk shows such as Coast to Coast AM and Future Theater, hasalso argued that AI developers are confronted with the issue of programming AIdevices in an entirely new way. For example, in the television science fictionseries Extant, a supercomputer whose primary mission is to defend the planetassumes a consciousness all its own and determines that the real threats toPlanet Earth are the human beings who inhabit it, pollute it, desecrate it, andkill off other species. In response, the computer’s algorithm sets about tosolve the problem of making human beings less of a malignant species. Itssolution: eliminate humans altogether, replacing them with androids who taketheir instructions directly from the supercomputer. This is the nightmarescenario Stephen Hawking, Steve Wozniak, and Ray Kurzweil warn us about, astruggle for survival between the Carbons (us) and the Silicons (artificial lifeforms). And so did Michael Crichton.At the turn of the twentieth century, Tesla argued that a preprogrammed roboticsoldier, or a torpedo, or a surface vessel operating under a set ofpreprogrammed instructions, could make its own decisions regarding where andwhen to attack. The United States Navy, and, we presume, the Russians, arealready testing drone minisubmarines preprogrammed to carry out specificmissions. Tesla even demonstrated his radio-controlled boat in New York City,but when he tried to sell his ideas about advanced automated weaponry to theNavy at the outset of World War I, it was Thomas Edison, then sitting on theNaval Consulting Board, who advised the Navy to reject Tesla’s plans. Theconcept of a robot-guided torpedo did not fade away with Edison’s turning Tesladown, however. It resurfaced over thirty years later when movie star Hedy Lamarrapplied for a patent to make Tesla’s idea into a workable weapon by developingwith composer George Antheil what today is referred to as “spread-spectrumtechnology.”Hedy Lamarr and the Spread-Spectrum TechnologyTesla’s ideas for radio-controlled weapons, although far ahead of their time,were also subject to a singular flaw in their inception: jamming. Think ofsomeone keying a microphone on a CB radio where the static-heavy carrier signalwill block any other transmissions on that frequency. We’ve already seenexamples of signal jamming and, worse, signal spoofing, when the Iranians onDecember 4, 2011, commandeered the electronic signals guiding a United Statesmilitary RQ-170 Sentinel unmanned aerial vehicle and ordered the device to landat an Iranian air base. They touted it as a major coup de guerre, demonstratingthe vulnerability of American automated weapons systems. Edison had imaginedthis possibility when looking at Tesla’s ideas. After all, if both sides wereequipped with radio-directional antennas, the enemy might be able to home in onthe radio frequency controlling the guided weapon, jam that frequency, andrender it inoperable. How to prevent that?The answer was provided by motion picture actress Hedy Lamarr and her partner,musical composer and co-inventor George Anthiel.58[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-023] Together, they came up with theidea of spread spectrum frequency technology. Here’s how it worked. Because allcombatants were using radios at the outset of World War II, they understood thatradio signals could be easily jammed, thereby preventing communication. Forradio-guided weapons, the jamming potential posed a particularly difficultproblem because the weapons could be rendered useless. This problem waspotentially magnified because German U-boats stalking the North Atlantic convoyswould have been able to jam incoming radio-guided allied torpedoes, making themmiss their marks.To solve this problem, Lamarr, a movie star by day and a genius inventor bynight, and Anthiel, who, as a composer, certainly understood the nature of soundfrequency, sought to camouflage the broadcast frequencies of radio-guidedtorpedoes by creating a spectrum of frequencies that the radio transmitter andreceiver switched to automatically.59[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-022] Only the transmitter and thereceiver aboard the torpedo’s guidance mechanism would be able to decrypt thechanging frequencies along a closed circuit, which in turn would prevent anyenemy jamming from taking place. In essence, the enemy would not be able todetermine the radio frequency to jam.Lamarr and Anthiel filed a United States patent (#US2292387 A) for their spreadspectrum technology in June 1941. Their patent was published in August 1942.60[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-021] But, as Lamarr would complainlate in her life, the Navy never actually availed itself of this technology inWorld War II. After fifteen years, the Sylvania Corporation registered its ownpatent for spread spectrum technology, a technology that was implemented duringthe Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, when Soviet submarines approached theUS naval blockade of Cuba.Many people don’t realize how close to a nuclear weapons exchange the US and theUSSR came. In fact, one Soviet submarine was ordered to prepare its missiles forlaunch against the United States while an American submarine shadowing theSoviet sub, silent, deep, lurking, had its torpedo doors open. But the Russianweapons officers refused to comply with the orders and the missiles were neverlaunched. During the same few days, US Air Force interceptors equipped withnuclear tipped air-to-air missiles were dispatched to their failsafe points overthe Bering Straits to await the overwhelming numbers of Soviet bombers theyexpected to encounter. It was an air battle that never took place because SovietPremier Nikita Khrushchev, according to former President Bill Clinton advisorDick Morris, backed down from a confrontation after overplaying his guidedmissile hand. In October 1962, despite Khrushchev’s having told his SupremeSoviet that the USSR possessed intercontinental ballistic missiles that couldreach the United States, the USSR did not actually have such weapons. Hisbacking down from a confrontation with President John F. Kennedy, because he hadoverestimated his ability to dominate a heavily drugged JFK at the Vienna Summitthe year before, was his own death knell.61[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-020] After the Cuban missile crisisended with JFK’s removal of US intermediate-range ballistic missiles from Turkeyand Russia’s pulling its missiles out of Cuba, Khrushchev lost his job as Sovietpremier and party chairman.The final footnote concerning the weapons deployed during that crisis is that itwas Tesla’s concept of a radio-controlled torpedo and Lamarr’s invention ofspread spectrum frequency technology that finally made their appearance duringthe tense moments when both superpowers were girding for war.As exotic as artificially intelligent computers and the weapons they controlmight be, what if, Futurist Ostman argued on the radio show Future Theater, anAI device were programmed to find a way to rid Earth of pollution, to bring theplanet back to where it could sustain life without the extinction of species? Inthat instance, looking for pollutants, what if that algorithm focuses on thepollution caused by human beings and then decides on its own that humanity isthe virus that’s infected the planet? And what if it takes steps to eradicatethat virus? After all, our planet had gone through climatological cycles forhundreds of millions of years and managed to keep on breeding life, therefore,why would humanity be the pollutant? Ostman argued that the overhead of humancivilization, the deforestation of the planet, the growth of large urbancenters, and the waste gasses spewed out by industry all contributed to makingthe climate extremes worse than if there were no human civilization.Accordingly, absent a “morality” algorithm, a set of limiters preventing thecomputer from harming its creators would turn AI computers into planetcleansers.Computer scientist Ray Kurzweil has speculated about the moment one artificiallyintelligent system recognizes another, evolves into a self-replicatingconsciousness, then generates the code necessary to expand its awareness untilit becomes conscious of itself as an existing entity. In that moment, which hecalls a “singularity,” how would that artificially intelligent device manifestitself? Would it announce its existence over a trillion telephones in a“Lawnmower Man” moment, declare its presence, start issuing orders to humanbeings, reach out to other digitally controlled devices such as power grids anddams, and ultimately follow Asimov’s third law to protect itself?Even more menacing is the fact that the military has taken advanced steps increating AI-based weaponry. For example, in the computer guidance, tracking, andweapons systems of the F-35 joint services fighter/interceptor, a computer atthe very edge of artificial intelligence can track multiple targetssimultaneously, relay that targeting information to its pilot’s helmet as wellas to other pilots in the combat squadron, then issue firing instructions afteridentifying and locking on to the targets. All of this is accomplished at thespeed of a computer, surpassing human reaction time. If this is the future, therobotic future is happening now as a weapon absent the prohibitions laid down byAsimov.The technology supporting the F-22 fighter also borders on the edge ofartificial intelligence. Onboard radar sensors are capable of gatheringinformation about a target, making determinations about the target, and relayingthat information to other pilots in the battle group or to flight controllersand targeting information processors on the ground. In mock air battles with thenow obsolescent F-15, the F-22 scored a kill ratio of 180 kills to no losses.Artificial Intelligence Systems and the Downing of TWA Flight 800Investigative journalist James Sanders62[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-019] reported that on July 16, 1996,over the south shore of Long Island, New York, the United States Navy shot downa commercial Boeing 747 jumbo jet on its way to Paris from JFK Internationalwith 230 passengers and crew aboard. All perished when the plane exploded inmidair and crashed into the ocean. After almost twenty years of investigation,Sanders was able to determine what happened on that night. He wrote, and thiswas confirmed by official Navy documents, that there was a military exercisetaking place that night in which a drone, probably simulating a cruise missileor anti-ship missile, was fired from the land over the ocean toward the southshore of Long Island. The mission was to shoot down that missile from asubmerged Navy submarine inshore. This shallow-water exercise was designed totest the feasibility of a submarine defending itself during brown wateroperations. But the exercise turned out much worse than anyone could haveimagined.The exercise was a test of a new weapons system designed to take the firecontrol decisions out of the hands of human beings and place them in the hand ofan AI-driven computer system, essentially a digital robot. It was a reaction tothe July 3, 1988, shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the Aegis missiledestroyer USS Vincennes over the Straits of Hormuz. It occurred during anoperation in which American naval vessels were escorting oil tankers through thestraits in the face of Iran’s threat to block the international seaway andprevent tankers from sailing toward their destinations.The commanding officer of the Vincennes, Captain Will Rogers III, said hebelieved that Flight 655 was not a commercial airliner—it actually was an AirbusA300—but an F-14 Tomcat warplane on a mission against his warship. He said thathe radioed the aircraft on a standard military hailing frequency to requestidentification. If Rogers had broadcast on a civilian frequency, he would haveidentified the aircraft as a commercial airliner. But he only tried to hail iton a military frequency and, getting no response, he misidentified it as afighter bomber on an attack mission.The vectors of the radar signatures were likely also confusing. Captain Rogersand his weapons officers believed that what they thought to be an F-14 wasdiving upon them for a bombing run. Instead, the plane was actually climbing outof a commercial airport using the proper flight lane in its ascent. TheVincennes’s radio warnings were also broadcast on military frequency, as opposedto commercial aviation, and thus the pilot did not respond. Consequently, eventhough other warships in the region believed Flight 655 to be no threat and didnot turn their weapons on it, the Vincennes did and fired two anti-aircraftmissiles, bringing the plane down and killing all 290 passengers aboard.This was an event so horrific that the United States Navy sought ways to preventit from ever happening again, to prevent human error that would result in thetragic deaths of noncombatants even in a war zone. Thus, they turned to anentirely new weapons system called Cooperative Engagement Capability, anartificially intelligent computer system that, they believed, would eliminatehuman error once and for all. The computer would do it.Here’s how it worked, this modern incarnation of Tesla’s roboti­cally guidedmissile, futuristic in its elegance, but absent the prohibitions of IsaacAsimov’s First Law of Robotics. After all, it was a weapons system designed tobe defensive, but designed to kill humans that were attacking it. BecauseCooperative Engagement Capability, or CEC, was designed to operate in brown, orshallow inshore, waterways, like the Straits of Hormuz, and possibly incommercial airlanes; no fly-zones notwithstanding, it had to meet the criteriaof filtering out land clutter and non-hostile airline traffic within heavilypopulated civilian environments. It relied on a cross-hatching of radars fromdifferent sources lighting up a specific area and a computer matching program todiscriminate among hostile, non-hostile, and friendly aircraft. So far so good.Then, once a computer-driven intelligent application determined that a hostiletarget was in the area, threatening the naval vessels, the computer identifiedthe target, locked on its targeting radar, decided what type of weapon would bedeployed and what the launch platform would be, and then issued—absent humanintervention—the commands to attack that target. It was supposedly a failsafemechanism that would not make a mistake.But it did.On the night of July 16, 1997, the same type of situation happened again, onlythis time one of our own planes was shot down. TWA Flight 800, on its way toParis, had been held up at JFK because its connecting flight from Chicago’sO’Hare was delayed due to thunderstorms rolling in over Lake Michigan. As aresult, Flight 800 took off an hour late, after Military Operations Area W-105had gone hot. Absent a warning from Air Traffic Control that W-105 had beenturned into a no-fly zone, Flight 800 took off from Kennedy. At approximatelythe same time, the Army launched a drone, simulating a missile, over thesouthern coast of Long Island. The cross hatching radars performed according totheir programming, locked onto the drone, and transmitted their identificationand targeting instructions to the small fleet of naval vessels on station offshore. Among those vessels was a yet-to-be commissioned nuclear-powered attacksubmarine, the Seawolf. The Seawolf, submerged, received the CEC data via theNavy’s newly developed blue-green water penetrating laser, and the computerdesignated the sub as the launch platform and initiated the arming of anantiaircraft missile. Then, pinpointing the drone, the computer launched thesemi-active radar missile. At the same time the missile was breaking the surfaceof the water, Flight 800 was climbing through the area. The missile, nowairborne and detecting a bigger target in its path and under control of its ownradar, deviated from its original course and turned its nose towards the 747 asthe crew of the Seawolf and the other vessels in the area watched their radarscreens in horror. History was repeating itself. Another vessel launched anantimissile missile at the Seawolf’s missile in a desperate attempt to destroyit before it hit the TWA 747. However, both missiles locked onto Flight 800, onemissile hitting where the right wing attached to the fuselage and blowing thenumber three engine off the wing. Just imagine the panic inside the passengercabin as the overhead oxygen masks dropped and the frantic pilots tried to rightthe plane, which had flipped over on its left side once the number three enginewas torn off. Then the remnants of the missile’s thermite warhead blew throughthe cabin and ignited the center wing tank. The second missile exploded on theleft side of the fuselage, striking the forward section of the aircraft whichbroke off and tumbled into the sea.All of this would make for a grand conspiracy theory if not for the fact thatthe entire event was witnessed by observers on Long Island’s south shore and afisherman on the water that night, who saw the missile rise from beneath theocean. Forensic evidence obtained by James Sanders showed that there was astreak of thermite residue in the 747 cabin, thermite which could not possiblyhave been a part of the passenger seat covers. The missile strike on the planewas also witnessed from above by Air National Guard pilots and by the pilot ofanother commercial airliner.While what happened in the aftermath of that airline tragedy is beyond the scopeof this book, suffice it to say that parts of the FBI and Department of Justiceinvestigation into the causes of the crash are still classified by thegovernment. In a likely effort to protect the highly classified nature of theweapons system that caused the shoot-down, President Bill Clinton was ordered,yes, ordered, to yank the whistleblower protection status from all navalpersonnel who were on station that night. But the witnesses, the forensicevidence, a video taken by a witness on Long Island’s south shore, a snapshotthat caught the cruise missile flying over Long Island’s Shinecock Bay, and theNavy’s own documents paint a picture of what actually happened. All of this onlygoes to show that 1) the dead past does not bury its dead, as the involvement ofthe New York office of the FBI in the 2016 presidential election will probablyreveal, and that 2) nothing, absolutely nothing, disappears without a trace. Forexample, a March 20, 2009, article in Space Daily describes the development inIsrael of new networked battlefield software system to integrate all situationalintelligence sources called SeaCom, seemingly an enhanced modernized version ofCEC.Was the Cooperative Engagement Capability system so highly classified that noteven the President or his closest advisors were allowed to talk about it? Weknow that there are levels of classification of information above Top Secret,levels to which the President is not normally privy. President Clinton oncecalled this the secret “government within the government.” Perhaps theCoope­rative Engagement system was one of those weapon types. We do know thatthe crash of TWA Flight 800 was discussed in the White House situation room.What we don’t know now is whether the President was specifically advised bymilitary brass not to talk about the crash or to let the NTSB and FBIinvestigations go forward on their own. We do know, or at least we have beentold, that there were such times in the past, specifically when President-electJimmy Carter asked then-director of the CIA George H. W. Bush to disclose sometop-secret files about anomalous aeronautical phenomena—UFOs—that the CIA mighthave had in its files. Director Bush refused to answer President-elect Carter’srequest, telling him that he had “no need to know.” Multiple witnesses haveconfirmed this exchange between Carter and future president Bush. And weremember President Obama’s response to ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’squestion about UFOs. Obama said, “They tell me not to talk about it.” Was hejoking?Today, both the US and Russian Navies are developing robotically controlled,artificially intelligent self-guided torpedo-like craft that can stay underwaterfor prolonged periods, receive updated targeting instructions, seek out enemysubmarines, and detonate themselves close enough to destroy them. These are notjust on the drawing boards; they are in their testing phases and close todeployment. These weapons systems, although they may seem like a far cry fromwhat Tesla tried to sell to the Navy at the outset of World War I, are actuallyexactly what Tesla envisioned, self-guided, roboti­cally controlled missiles.However, as Isaac Asimov predicted, the best-laid plans of men and robots “gangaft agley.”Similarly, the Navy is also pre-positioning a system of storing underwaterdrones in large enclosures on the sea bottom, a type of pre-deployment of aweapons system that can be activated remotely in time of war to seek out anddestroy enemy shipping. Building on Tesla’s idea of preprogrammed instructions,the drones could be used to intercept enemy submarines, especiallyguided-missile-launching submarines, to prevent them from reaching their launchpoints. A plus is that the drones do the job far less expensively in terms ofhuman and hardware assets of engaging enemy submarines underwater.The United States is so heavily invested in the military potential of artificialintelligence that former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter repeatedly turned tothe high-tech community in Silicon Valley for help in countering cyber threatsto the United States. He also turned to them for offensive tactics such as“cyber bombs” to attack an enemy’s cyber infrastructure. The latter is importantbecause the theory behind cyber warfare is not just protection but a realizationthat our only other near-peer superpowers, Russia and China, have developed newgenerations of weapons that could pose a threat in the near term, a threat thatcame to fruition in the 2016 presidential election when, according to all of ourintelligence services and the FBI, the Russians, under Vladimir Putin’s orders,hacked into our electoral process so as to throw the election to their preferredcandidate. Looking at these threats from advanced weaponry, the DefenseDepartment has embraced what it calls the “Third Offset Strategy,” a reliance on“computer-based high-tech weapons” to offset the technological emergence ofChina as a near-peer adversary and Russia’s re-emergence as a developer ofhigh-tech weapons.63 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-018] The UnitedStates, Secretary Carter revealed, is facing enemies with larger inventories ofweapons and larger mili­tary forces, which means we will have to defendourselves against superior odds. As a result, our weapons have to be smarterthan humans in order to make the correct decisions, either at the battle frontor behind the lines.The development of artificial intelligence poses a unique challenge for themilitary. Unlike weapons development in the twentieth century, artificialintelligence technology is being developed in the consumer and business sectors.Systems such as Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Amazon’s Alexa, while notcomplete artificial intelligence packages, conform themselves to the mostfrequent decisions made by users, and will have the ability to predict choicestheir users will make. Because the application of artificial intelligence to theneeds of users is taking place outside the military industrial complex so as toaddress the needs of business and civilian users, Secretary Carter said, “That’sdifferent than thirty or forty or fifty years ago when we expected to controlthe pace of technology.”64 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-017]Lest we think that only the military deploys artificially intelligent systemsaggressively, we only have to look closer to home, both at police agencies andcommercial enterprises. In modern police work, companies are working hard toprovide software to law enforcement that sweeps up information from socialmedia, phone records, and credit-card purchases to build profiles that policecan use, often without warrants, to identify suspects and initiate surveillance.But it’s not the police who make the decisions about whom to identify, it’s anartificially intelligent algorithm that predicts whether an individual is likelyto have a criminal intent as measured by his or her actions. This is not sciencefiction. It is an advanced use of artificial intelligence, a computer onlyresponsible to its internal logic even though it ultimately reports to judicialprocedures.In a Dallas police sniper incident in July 2016, the police, having cornered thesniper in a building, dispatched a bomb-carrying robot to approach the armed anddangerous sniper and detonate itself, killing the sniper. Although Dallas PoliceChief David Brown told reporters that his negotiators had made repeated attemptsto talk the sniper into surrendering, he felt he had no choice but to dispatchthe robot. But, as reported in Time magazine, there were a number of ethicalquestions that were raised, not the least of which was that this entire robotdetonation incident in a civilian police engagement was nothing less than anevolutionary event. A robot was deliberately dispatched to kill a human being.Is this just a real-life version of RoboCop or are we looking at something farworse, the beginning of something we can’t stop?65[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-016]What this discussion shows is that even as we look at the works of Tesla andEdison, their theories about how things work and their predictions about thenature of life and how life can be imitated by machines still resonate today andaffect the world we live in. Artificially intelligent systems have brought usinto the future. But they are the future based upon what both Edison and Teslaenvisioned, as both scientists foresaw the rise of machines and theiramalgamation with human systems.Edison’s Predictions for the FutureAs early as 1911, Edison predicted in both Cosmopolitan magazine and the MiamiMetropolis that steam-powered railroad trains would one day be powered byelectricity and would travel at fantastic speeds. His prediction will finally berealized in the US, according to Elon Musk, who, among other innovators oftechnology, has laid out plans for high-speed magnetically levitated trainsrunning between Los Angeles and San Francisco as well as along the Northeastcorridor from Boston to Washington, DC.Edison predicted that the printed book would be replaced by electronic books,which might be how you’re reading this, delivered almost instantly frompublishers to buyers and readers. Travelers, he predicted, would be able toreach their destinations by air, flying at speeds as fast as two hundred milesan hour. (We know that modern military aircraft have already exceeded the speedof Mach 3 and that commercial airliners fly at speeds in excess of 500 knots.)Steel, he said, would replace most wood in furniture. In fact, he predicted thatinfants would be rocked in steel cradles and that furniture itself would be solight that one person could easily move it from place to place. One only has toimagine the assembly of lightweight build-it-yourself furniture such as onemight find at stores like IKEA to see that Edison was right on target in thisprediction. Similarly, Edison predicted that steel-reinforced concrete would bethe construction material of choice for new buildings, replacing brick and woodframe. This, too, has come to pass. Edison predicted that telephonic technologywould usher in a new age of information sharing, turning the device that Bellinvented and that Edison improved into a type of knowledge dispensation device.With such a device, callers might be identified not by their names but by otherforms—think of today’s avatars in a telephone-based Internet universe—and thatone would use telephones to get price quotations from various markets,especially the stock and gold markets.Gold, Edison also predicted, would cease to become a precious metal because thetwenty-first century’s rediscovery of the protocols of alchemy would mean thatscientists would solve the age-old mystery of transmutation from lead into gold.Instead, according to the late Terrence McKenna, it was alchemy itself thatchanged, morphing from the transmutation of metals into the morphing of scienceitself to recreate what science perceived as reality. By the 1940s, Naziengineers in Poland, for example, were trying to fabricate the transmutation ofheavy metal in liquid form into radioactive elements to build the fuel for anatomic bomb. The process, which took place inside a hollowed-out mountain in theOwl Mountains in Poland, was only stopped as Soviet troops approached and SSColonel Kurt Debus, the manager of the Nazi project, called “Die Glocke,” fledalong with his research to the allies as part of Operation Paperclip. If thisnuclear enrichment device had worked in time, it would have provided the Naziswith fissionable material they could have used, theoretically, at least, tobuild a nuclear weapon.Machines, Edison told Cosmopolitan, would assemble products themselves, robotson assembly lines rather than simply fabricating separate individual parts forhuman workers to assemble. In this, Edison envisioned the robotic factory, thestaple of modern car manufacturers across the globe. Edison’s vision of theautomated factory, machines building other machines, was at least a decade aheadof Fritz Lang’s dystopian silent film Metropolis, in which human beings fed themachines that powered the society that kept the worker humans as subjects to thedemands of technology.Edison didn’t confine his prognostications about the future of technology andautomation to the world of business, industry, and consumer productmanufacturing. In 1911, he also imagined a world in which many socially divisiveissues would be resolved. For example, he predicted that technology wouldeliminate the need for war and that the twenty-first century would see a time ofpeace. Of course, World Wars I and II had not taken place yet and thedeve­lopment of nuclear weapons had not threatened civilization. But Edisonpredicted that after a series of climactic battles, the world would settle downto peace because that was the only alternative to destruction. And, finally,technology itself would be the means to end poverty in civilization. Humanbeings, he said, would enter a period of plenty in which the class differencesseparating haves from have-nots would be eliminated.This looked to be a rosy future, indeed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13MEDIUMS, MINDS, AND MACHINES IN THE ROARING TWENTIESBy 1920, as Thomas Edison entered the last decade of his life, he was at theforefront of the triumph of science over the age of pure spiritualism, eventhough the two streams of thought were coming together.The twenties were the decade during which the world, in which Edison had createdhis greatest inventions and launched the three great industries that woulddefine the twentieth century, had changed dramatically. In the aftermath of theGreat War, World War I, there was a tremendous sense of malaise in the West.World War I was the first war involving significant loss of civi­lianpopulation. It was the first mechanized war and the first war where a weapon ofmass destruction—poison gas—was used. World War I was the first official air warthat involved not just chivalrous pilots saluting one another from theircockpits as they engaged in dogfights, but a war in which bombs were dropped onnoncombatants who had no means of escape. World War I was a war of machines, oftanks and motor vehicles and huge pieces of artillery drawn by train to wreakhavoc on cities. And it was a bitter war fought in the trenches of France andBelgium, in which waves of infantry expended themselves in hopeless charges,winding up stretched across barbed wire and lying in pools of mud inside thecraters created by the explosions of artillery shells. This was a war withoutglory, without chivalry or honor, and whose heroes would return home with lungsrotting away from mustard gas or shell-shocked into a near somnambulistic state.We call that post-traumatic stress disorder today, and it influenced the entirepostwar generation.It was no wonder that the generation of youth that fought that war called itselfthe “lost generation.” Just imagine an entire generation desperately sufferingemotionally from the aftermath of a new kind of war, from deprivation, and fromthe transition, brought about by war, from an agricultural country to amechanized, urban one. It was as if all the elements of a collectivepost-traumatic reaction came together.Prohibition and ExcessThe 1920s was also the decade of Prohibition in America, when alcoholmanufacture and distribution were illegal and the market for providing alcoholwas left to organized crime. Thus, much like today, the illegality of asubstance actually created a huge contraband market, with organized crimecartels forming their own local economies and taking over whole cities throughbribery and corruption. That alternate economy run by the mob also created agreat sense of distrust in the government and contributed to the malaise of the1920s; this, despite the growth of Edison’s new motion-picture industry, which,by the end of the decade, would also be penetrated by the crime cartels fromChicago and New York seeking to organize the unions.The 1920s was a decade of financial excess. Although this may have seemed likean anathema to a conservative businessman like Edison, it might also have seemedlike an opportunity to the entrepreneurial side of Edison. His company, GeneralElectric, would have benefited from the free flow of investment dollars in thepublicly traded stock market because the margin calls on stock purchases wereincredibly favorable to buyers. For example, for an investment of just 10percent, ten cents on the dollar, one could purchase stock on margin, bettingthat the surging prices of stocks would ultimately make up for the ninetypercent loan from the brokerage house. Stated another way, if you bought stockat $1,000 at 10 percent margin, owing 90 percent of the value of that stock, andthen the price of that stock increased so that your $1,000 value became $2,000,you could pay back the $900 you borrowed and make a hefty $1,000 on the dealwhen you sold the stock. Multiply this and one can see why traders investedheavily on favorable margins. But, just like the financial housing bubble thatburst into the Great Recession of 2008 and the leveraged buy-out crisis of the1980s, all good things come to end when the bank calls in the loan. Thishappened in 1929, thus initiating the stock market crash.But during the Roaring Twenties, Edison was a witness to this perceived greataffluence and, perhaps, knowing about previous stock market crises, he was alsowary of financial overindulgence. He consequently sought an invention that mightnot depend upon heavy investment. His use of a simple light-beam projector and aphotoelectric cell, as primitive as that sounds, would have been just the typeof apparatus, had it worked in the design phase, to open up an entirely newmarket, at a price that individuals could afford. It would have been just likeany home appliance, albeit to contact the spirit world.The Third CultureAs the scientific industrial revolution—as opposed to the scientificintellectual revolution of the sixteenth century—that began at the end of thenineteenth century took hold, it did not entirely sweep away the trailing edgeof the Great Age of Spiritualism. In fact, the two intellectual and culturalmovements actually merged by the 1920s, creating a third culture, a neospiritualmovement that encompassed the science of the unseen—atoms, quantum theory, themovement of electrons—with the spiritual and the world of noncorporeal entities.It was only in 1935, a few years after Edison’s death, that the theory ofquantum entanglement was first proposed. However, it seems that Edison mighthave already had an inkling concerning the nature of quantum entanglement, therelationship between sepa­rate quanta of matter that behaved with such asynchronicity that if one quantum spins one way, then its partner, or partners,would perform in exactly the same way. And if quanta could be entangled acrossspace, why couldn’t they be entangled across time? This was a theoreticalunderpinning to Heisenberg’s theory of uncertainty as well as a scientificrationale for the phenomena of remote viewing as articulated by one of its earlydevelopers, Ingo Swann.66 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-015] Itwas called “spooky action at a distance” or cohesion, and it became the basisfor the design principle behind Edison’s spirit phone.Edison’s Theories of Designfor the Spirit PhoneEdison had to bring a number of theories together to engineer his spirit phone.First, he had to refine his thoughts about the cohesion of subatomic bits ofmatter, things he could not see but believed existed. He formulated an idea thatif human consciousness, sapience, and the essence of personality were the resultof bits of matter coming together, a purely materialistic theory, then why wouldthe death of the body destroy the cohesion among the particles? Perhaps, evenfor a short time after death, the bits of matter that made up a human being’sconsciousness still stayed together, which is what the UK’s Sir Roger Penrosehas theorized. If they stayed together, then how would we know they stayedtogether?67 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-014]Edison’s second theory: What if these bits of matter were charged electrically?They might simply be electron-based. If electrons or similar units, then theywould certainly give off an electrical charge, a negative charge.Third theory: What would happen if a cohesive bundle of nega­tively chargedparticles crossed through a tightly focused field of photons, light? If theydid, they should generate an interference with the photon stream and register aform of electric charge on a receiving cell or meter. If all that were to betrue, then an ideal experiment would involve building a device that generated anarrowly focused photon field toward another object, at the end of which was acell to register anything crossing through that field. Then, if there were somesort of meter attached to the cell, Edison should get registration on thatmeter, something he could measure and prove to exist scientifically so as to beable to repeat it.This seemed simple enough, but there was still one question that had to beanswered before anything else: how would one know whether an entity, a cohesionof matter, was actually in the area so as to prove the theory of the spiritmachine, a proof of concept? Edison would have to find a way to summon thecohesion of matter, a spirit of the departed. And this is where his sciencemerged with the supernatural. How do you summon a spirit?The Role of Mediums and ClairvoyantsEdison believed that mediums who claimed they could communicate with the deadwere charlatans. And although he had heard the stories of the Fox sisters in thelatter nineteenth century and had seen America’s fascination with communicatingwith the dead via mediumship through the early twentieth century, he did notbelieve those stories were true. He thought that mediums, particularly the Foxsisters, who had admitted to faking their claims, were simply nightclubperformers. However, if Edison could test the efficacy of using mediums tosummon departed spirits, then he could use their efforts to test out his twotheories: 1) that bits of electrically charged matter comprising theconsciousness of the departed still remained cohesive after death, and 2) thatif this cohesion of electrons passed through a photon field they would registeron that field. If these two theories were true, then might the meter he plannedto put at one end of the field attached to a photoelectric cell be able toregister that presence of a cohesion of electrons?Even if he could prove all of the theories by developing a machine that wouldregister the presence of cohesion of electronically charged particles, wouldthat be enough? How could you differentiate a random spike on an electricalmeter with the scientific proof that the spike indicated the consciousness of adeparted spirit? In order to do that, you needed a means of communicating withthat spirit via another channel so as to confirm the results. Moreover, whatwould the results be? How do you actually speak to a departed spirit through adevice? A spirit guide can at least translate any telepathic messages, but atelephone? An entity actually has to speak into one end in order for sound tocome out a speaker. Can departed spirits vocalize?Edison figured that if his machine worked, he could devise a code, maybe evenstarting with what the Fox sisters did, a yes/no dialogue in which tworegistrations would mean yes and one registration would mean no. From there,perhaps he could move on to a Morse code to develop an actual language. And,thus, by stages, Edison believed that he could figure out how to build amachine, based on scientific principles of conductivity and photoelectricity andgrounded in the theory that matter is never destroyed or created but onlychanges form, that would communicate with the dead.Edison’s Killer AppHis next goal was to figure out what the market might say about such a device.If the market didn’t exist, then he would make a product that would create themarket it sought to satisfy. Stated simply, Edison invented what today we callthe concept of the “killer app.” Edison invented the motion-picture camera andfrom that created the motion-picture entertainment industry. He figured out howsound waves could be translated into physical grooves on a rotating foilcylinder and thus created the recording industry. Now, in the wake of World WarI and the horrendous loss of life, Edison saw another market, the market of thebereaved.Hence, combining theories of Spiritualism and Materialism, set within thecontext of a worldwide malaise and grief over the loss of life and a way of lifeafter World War I, Edison commenced his development of the spirit phone. Inorder to do that, however, he had to determine that there was a real science, anabsolute materia­lism underlying the practice of spiritualism.Was there really such a science and where is it today?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14THE SCIENCE OF MEDIUMSHIP, CLAIRVOYANCE, AND REMOTE VIEWINGFor Edison, a man of science whose whole career of inventions was premised onthe discernible and quantifiable flow of electrons, it would take a great leapto impart a basis in science to spiritualism and the paranormal. Yet, by theearly twentieth century a conside­rable body of scientific research and evenempirical evidence had built up promising just such a scientific premise to theparanormal. And this is what was necessary for Edison to come to grips with theunderlying theory of the spirit phone.A common belief is that mediumship and channeling are either completelyparanormal events not subject to science, or they’re complete hoaxes. Butneither of these two beliefs is necessarily true. Even some true believersassert that mediumship and clairvoyance are not subject to the rules of sciencebut lie outside the realm of materialistic proof. We know, for example, thatEdison, though he called mediums “charlatans” in his diary, had employed theservices of medium Bert Reese to communicate with the unseen spirit world. Thus,if a scientist and electrical engineer and inventor such as Edison dabbled withmediums, doesn’t that imply that he saw some science to the paranormal?American Society for Psychical ResearchAlthough there is a concerted scientific approach to studying the paranormaltoday, specifically by Dean Radin,68[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-013] we also know that mediumshipduring Edison’s lifetime had already been stu­died scientifically. Much of thiswas done at the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR) in the 1880s,where researchers devised experiments to rule out chicanery. Much like the waymodern skeptics try to eliminate the possibility that self-describedclairvoyants can use clues from their subjects to reach answers, theseresearchers sought to control the conditions under which those being testedarrived at their conclusions. Thus, researchers sought to evaluate theirsubjects’ results objectively and statistically. This is the same type ofresearch being conducted today, especially in light of the CIA-funded RemoteViewing Program at the Stanford Research Institute back in the 1980s, asdescribed by retired Army major Paul H. Smith, PhD, in his book Reading theEnemy’s Mind.69 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-012]Among the questions raised during the scientific evaluation of mediumship andclairvoyance was whether communicating with the dead was really proof of lifeafter death or simple mental telepathy? Was the clairvoyant actually picking upmessages from the other side or was the clairvoyant picking up thoughts from asubject’s mind about the departed person? In Edgar Cayce’s transactions with hisclients and subjects, including President Woodrow Wilson after Wilson hadsuffered a debilitating stroke, it seemed clear that he was picking upimpressions from his subject. Was that what was happening with otherclairvoyants? This is the science that Edison sought to determine with hisspirit phone.Though the ASPR claimed that their research showed mediumship was real and couldbe proven, their research did not persuade skeptics, who argued that the resultswere skewed and that there were no real scientific controls. Edison was amongthe skeptics, because he believed in the basic premise of scientific testing toprove a theory: repeatability. If the same exact result couldn’t be reached byrepeated attempts, then the results would be false and nonscientific. Hence, forproof, there had to be both statistical relia­bility, which meant that theresults could not be simply random but more than a 50/50 success rate, and thesuccess rate, if any, had to be repeatable objectively by others.J.B. RhineThe next researchers of note were J. B. Rhine and his wife Louisa, both withdoctorates, who designed and ran an innovative laboratory at Duke Universitythat promoted scientific study of extrasensory perception (ESP) during the1920s. Their research, published by the Boston Society for Psychic Research,quickly became a topic discussed in popular publications. The Rhines testedtheir respondents with what they called “Zener cards,” which had differentshapes on them, such as a wavy line, a cross, a circle, a square, or a star.Subjects could not see the shapes on the card, but had to determine them usingwhat the Rhines believed were psychic abilities or ESP. Theoretically, subjectsguessing by chance would have a one in five chance of guessing the right shape,because there were five different shapes. They used shapes because they feltthat the standard designs on the cards should be completely neutral so as not toarouse the emotions of the subjects. If the subjects had a high percentage ofaccuracy in determining the hidden shapes on the card, according to the Rhines,it would mean that, statistically, there was something else at work besides purechance—a higher ESP capability, in other words. Although the Rhines’ resultswere subjected to critical analyses from statisticians who argued that themethodology was faulty, other experiments using similar types of shapeidentification also showed that the success rate was greater than random chance.Hence, there was some science, albeit rebuttable, to what the Rhines were doing.Important for our purposes here is that these experiments were taking place atthe time when Edison was perfecting his spirit phone. Moreover, because theRhines’ experiments were being picked up by the popular press, Edison certainlywould have known about them even if he had not read their original report. Wealso know that the entire question of ESP fascinated Edison.Sir William CrookesOne individual with whom Edison did correspond was the British inventor SirWilliam Crookes, a scientist—chemistry and physics—who was a highly regardedscholar and a member of the Royal Society of Chemistry. His specialty wasspectroscopy, a dissection and analysis of an element’s light emanation. Thespectral analysis of an object can determine what it’s made of. Crookes appliedspectroscopy to the paranormal by analyzing the light from mediums, similar toan aura, which allowed him, he said, to determine the material of a spirit aswell as that of the medium who said he was channeling the spirit. Thus, Crookesclaimed he was able to see changes in the matter around him during spiritualencounters. His paranormal experiments claimed to have found evidence of what hecalled “spirit photographs.”Whatever Edison might have gleaned from Crookes most likely bolstered his theoryfor the spirit phone. If Crookes’s scientific approach to the presence of aspirit around a medium was to identify specific material based on a lightpattern, then might a projected beam of light offer the means not only toidentify the presence of a spirit but also to record that presence on a meterwired to a photoelectric cell? This was the challenge. Thus, we can assume thatEdison did not come up with his idea for a spirit phone in a vacuum. Rather, hehad evidence of its possibility based upon Crookes’ own spirit photographs, realscience based upon the ana­lysis of the dispersion of light. Again, this wasreal science applied to the validation of the existence of the spirit world. Thequestion is, what would Edison do with the qualitative analysis that Crookes’swork produced?Though older, his mind remained sharp. His rivalry with Tesla continued to drivehim, even though Tesla was outpacing him in venturing into unknown scientificterritory, particularly with theories that radio waves are eternal and carrymessages from extraterrestrials as well as from spirits. Could Edison, now acorporate giant, simply accept Tesla’s presence and retire with his memories ofgreat accomplishments? Not a chance. That was not his manner nor personality.There was more to do, and thus he announced his next proposed invention, causinga “national sensation.” Edison’s announcement generated nationwide sentiment,both among families, who had lost loved ones and sought Edison’s help incontacting them, and among skeptics and religious fundamentalists, who wroteEdison accusing him of witchcraft. Asked if he believed in life after death,Edison was quick to answer that he was a man of science, and that his idea for adevice to communicate with the dead had nothing to do with belief.Skeptics were especially critical about Edison’s pronouncement because it flewin the faces of those who resisted talk of an afterlife or spirit world.Powerful opposition came from conservative organized religion, which held thatheaven and the afterlife belonged in the domain of theology. Atheists, ofcourse, debunked spiritualism outright. But for Thomas Edison, looking at thewritings of Swedenborg and Blavatsky and reading the work of the Rhines andCrookes, spiritualism was a form of science even if it did not measure thepassing of electrons through a circuit. But what if it could?Edison, as noted earlier, had a curiosity about what happens to us after death.Is there an afterlife, a spirit world? Might there be a heaven and a hell? Canthose of us who are alive communicate with the deceased? At one point Edison hadeven attended séances conducted by Bert Reese, who worked in his laboratory. Itwas a fascinating idea to bring science to a study of the afterlife. And itwould be even more fascinating, Edison thought, to build upon the work of SirWilliam Crookes, to prove with a light beam and electrical current what Crookesclaimed he had proven with spectral analysis. Edison was following in a greattradition.Sir Oliver LodgeThe year 1920 ushered in an interesting era in a changing America. Among otherthings, there was a rebirth of interest in spiritualism. One of the most famousscientists of the time, Sir Oliver Lodge, had lost his son Raymond during WorldWar I and sought mediums in the hope of communicating with him. Lodge wasparticularly focused on the “survival of memory,” something that must haveinspired and might have been a contributing influence to the modern theories oflife after death promulgated by Sir Roger Penrose almost a century later.New ideas such as atomic energy and quantum physics had come to the fore, andwith them new names, including Einstein, Freud, Jung, and Max Planck. Edison,ever the competitor, knew he needed something new, something spectacular. Thespirit phone, he told several science magazines, would be built based onscientific tenets. He fully expected it to work.George AndersonIn 1981, fifty years after Edison’s death, a New York man in his late twenties,George Anderson, agreed to a series of tests to determine if his ability as amedium was genuine. Over the next several years Anderson underwent dozens ofexperiments, many conducted live on radio and TV. The tests covered a wide rangeof Anderson’s psychic gifts, and were supervised or observed by an array ofscien­tists, physicians, psychologists, various medical personnel, engineers,skeptics and debunkers, magicians, parapsychologists, and members of the clergy.Some of the experiments utilized scientific technology such as EEGs, MRIs, andCAT scans. The goal was to determine if there were changes in brain activityboth before and during times the medium claimed he was receiving messages fromthe departed. To the surprise of those involved in the testing, the medium haddemonstrated a high degree of accuracy in his communications, and displayedbrain state changes. In this way, not only did he beat the odds of randomchance, he demonstrated medically as well as empirically that there was ascience to the paranormal.In several other medical and scientific settings in the US, Canada, and Europe,others were also performing experiments about paranormal abilities, and suchrelated phenomena as near-death experiences. Too often, however, successful orpositive results received scant public attention or went unreported. Despitethis, mediumship and other psychic events are slowly being accepted by anincreasing number of scientists; more people are open about their experiences;and the paranormal, especially the question of life after death, has become apopular topic in the media.Many think that the testing of George Anderson marked the beginning of a modernage of mediumship. Thanks to advanced technology as well as more scientistshaving open minds about the possibility of communication with an afterlife,types of testing that had not been possible in the nineteenth century could nowtake place.The first time Anderson demonstrated his mediumistic abi­lity for a group offriends and witnesses, he was uncannily accurate. How did he know of the habitsof a subject’s late wife? What gave him a clue that another subject had beenabused as a child? How did he determine that another subject had been a twin,whose twin sibling died very young? Did some spirit entity tell him that asubject’s uncle was dying of prostate cancer? Was it a trick? Could the mediumsomehow have had advanced knowledge of the subject he was “reading”? Was hepicking up verbal or visual cues from a subject? These were all reasonablequestions. Precautions had been taken in anticipation of such objections,however. Anderson and the subjects did not know each other, which ruled out thechance that the medium had gotten any information ahead of time. And in the caseof readings over the telephone, the only answers a subject could give were ‘yes’or ‘no.’ Thus, there was no chance of visual or verbal cues tipping off themedium.Since little was written in the 1980s about the science of mediumship or testingsomeone for mediumistic ability, it was necessary to create tests with the helpof everyone, from scientists to skeptics. The tests that were organizedsometimes seemed deceptively simple. Objections from skeptics and debunkers werealways a factor to contend with. For that reason skeptics were included in thegroup of experts, including one who was both a psychic debunker and magicianwith the skill to recognize any deception. The goal was not to prove that themedium was genuine, it was to demonstrate whether the medium was behaving in afraudulent manner or whether there might be another explanation for the medium’ssuccessful results. Every precaution against chicanery was taken.Anderson was a frequent radio guest, talking about his abilities and invitingcallers to ask him questions. This was the beginning of late-night open-mikeradio. One night, while answering listener questions on air at a Long Island,New York, radio show, Anderson received a call from an anonymous male. Anyonewho phoned in to the live shows was asked to say hello or say some innocuousphrase so as not to give the medium any name, advance information, or even thehint of a foreign accent. The first word Anderson heard from the caller was,“Hello.” The medium’s answer was to suggest that the caller had an unusualamount of psychic ability. The conversation between the two continued for a fewmore moments before the person who phoned in identified himself. He was RobertPetro, one of the nation’s most gifted and successful psychic-clairvoyants. Howdid Anderson know that the anonymous caller was someone with a high degree ofextrasensory perception?In another test, the goal was to determine if distance was any factor in themedium’s ability or accuracy. Most of those phoning in were from the greater NewYork area. This time, however, the female voice at the other end of the phoneline was calling from Hawaii. The arrangement was made by the show’s producerwithout the knowledge of either the host or Anderson. The medium’s accuracy wasno different than if the caller had been around the corner. Clearly, distancedid not matter.Following each experiment, typically within the next few days, the group ofscientists, skeptics, and parapsychologists gathered to analyze and theorize thetest’s outcome. Members of the group often disagreed; but that was the purposeof discussing the medium’s conclusions from several different disciplines,including theology.One day Anderson was visited by a thin elderly man who was dressed in shabbyclothing that reeked of alcohol. His sparse grey hair was unkempt and he wasunshaven. Anderson was at first startled by the stranger. This was not the kindof person who typically sought Anderson’s psychic readings. The medium stared athis strange visitor. Was he homeless? Was he a drunkard? Within moments,Anderson asked the man whether there was a reason he saw the spirit of SigmundFreud behind him. Perhaps the visitor was a mental patient? The strangeracknowledged that yes, psychically seeing Sigmund Freud made sense. Finally theman confessed. He’d heard George Anderson on radio and was convinced hismediumship was trickery or outright fraud. The man admitted he was neitherhomeless nor a drunk. The stranger had disguised himself in hopes of testing orfooling Anderson into picking up on incorrect visual clues. In fact, he was arespected and successful psychiatrist. That explained why Anderson clairvoyantlysaw what he presumed was the spirit of the late famed psychiatrist Dr. SigmundFreud. The doctor was both stunned and impressed. He had not duped the medium bypretending to be someone else.One evening, also at the radio station, Anderson was introduced to a handsome,middle-aged man meticulously dressed in a three-piece suit, his hair perfectlygroomed. He was introduced as “Joseph,” who was visiting the United States fromLondon, where he was in banking. Anderson stared at the visitor for a fewmoments. It should be noted they’d never met before, and that Joseph did notbelieve in mediumship, an afterlife, or a spirit world. Anderson suddenly asked,“Why do I see John Lennon’s spirit near you?” “I don’t know,” Joseph answered.Anderson insisted, then went on to explain that the ex-Beatle’s spirit waspsychically communicating an account about how he and Joseph were boyhoodfriends in Liverpool. Psychically, Anderson heard Lennon tell of one incidentwhen they were at a party and Lennon threw ice cubes down Joseph’s back as ajoke. Joseph recalled the incident well, but could not understand how Andersoncould possibly know it. The medium continued by recounting several personalincidents, including a family death years ago. By now Joseph was shaken andpale. Who was Joseph? He was not a London banker at all. He worked in marketingand promotion in the music and entertainment industry, although he did not lookor sound it. Joseph was certain the medium could not have known about the icecube incident. It was another mystery in the science of mediumship.It was not unusual for Anderson to receive phone calls and letters throughoutthe 1980s and 1990s from scientists, atheists, debunkers, and skeptics.Typically they were individuals who were certain Anderson, and other psychicsand mediums, were all frauds. Anderson and his radio host developed an answerfor them. Since most of the debunker/skeptical callers had access to technology,they were asked whether they wanted to test any of the mediums, includingAnderson, with their equipment and announce their findings on live radio or TV.One phone call from an angry doctor threatened that if Anderson were a fraud,the doctor would take legal action. As a result, Anderson underwent a series oftests that employed thermography, which involves a device that tests heatemanating from the body and color codes hot and cold areas. Anderson wasinstructed by the doctor in charge of the testing to give psychic readings toeach of several subjects known only to the physician. Each subject had aspecific health problem which Anderson was to identify; heat output from a partof Anderson’s body would register on the thermography machine’s screen,indicating that the subject had an issue in the same area. The subjects were notpermitted to speak or acknowledge any answer Anderson gave. Record-keeping wasmaintained in writing and on video. Anderson was dressed only in a pair ofshorts and was sitting in a chilly, temperature-controlled room. He could notsee the thermography screen or the results. In other words, not only was hedeprived of any physical feedback to his questions, he was deliberately keptchilled so that his body heat, if it registered, would show up dramatically onthe thermograph.The first subject was a young woman. As soon as Anderson saw her, his leftbreast heated upon the thermography screen, indicating that he was experiencingneuromuscular thermal reactions to sensations he was receiving from the testsubjects. Anderson correctly identified each subject’s area of illness until thelast subject, a middle-aged woman. On the screen one could see Anderson’s throatheat up as he told the woman he psychically sensed that she had a problem withher throat and back. The physician marked that as wrong. She was the physician’sown patient, but not for any difficulty in the throat area. Still, Anderson’sresults were statistically impressive. But wait. The session was not overbecause the woman wanted to say something. Not known to anyone present, shortlybefore she entered the room with Anderson she became nervous and a lozenge she’dbeen sucking on became stuck in her throat. When Anderson’s throat heated up, asindicated by the color red on the screen, he psychically experienced momentarypain in his throat. This was unknown to the physician, but known to the womanand correctly picked by Anderson. The physician in charge of the testing wasleft speechless.At another time and location, under the supervision of a physician andtechnician, Anderson was again tested with the thermography device. Once more hewas accurate with anonymous subjects. In one experiment he was tested against askilled magician who was unable to register more than minuscule temperaturechanges. It was also valuable to test the medium several times in controlledsettings, to determine if there was repeatability in his psychic demonstrations.A neurologist at a New York hospital was skeptical about Anderson’s purportedability to contact the afterlife. But, after thousands of psychic readings, whataccounted for the medium’s high degree of accuracy? This doctor was curiousabout what changes—if any—had occurred in Anderson’s brain during the time hesaid he was receiving messages from the departed.It was not a trivial question. Mediums and clairvoyants often claim they must beplaced in a trance before they can psychically communicate. Skeptics argue thatthe trance state is simply an affectation or false display to impress thepublic. Anderson never appeared to enter a trance state prior to his readings.Were their changes in his brain when he claimed he was hearing or sensingspirits?Anderson was connected by electrodes from his head to an EEG, a machine thatdisplays brain wave states at various times. For example, our brain waves aremore active (Beta or Alpha) when we are awake or active, but when we are relaxed(Theta) the brain waves slow, and when we are in a deep sleep (Delta) they areat their slowest.Anderson was accurate with the subject he was reading. What interested themedical team as much as the accuracy of his answers was the fact that althoughthe medium remained awake, registering Alpha waves, his brain wave state slowedto Theta when he said he was communicating with a departed relative of thesubject, a young man chosen by the neurologist.Other tests subsequently revealed that the mediumistic ability was located inthe right side of the brain, known as the right temporal lobe. One series oftests conducted on several mediums by a clinical psychologist found that many ofthem receive messages from the departed in the form of symbols, much the way wedream. The right side of the brain is recognized as the lobe that deals withdreams, artistic, and creative processes. It may also be the side of the brainthat operates when we pray or have religious or mystical experiences, which iswhy some scientists have identified the right temporal lobe as the “God spot.”It appears that the so-called “right brain” is where psychic or paranormalmessages are received or sent, which makes perfect sense according topsychologist Julian Jaynes, who argued that it was messaging from the righthemisphere of the brain that pre-linguistic humans believed were impressionsreceived from their deities.One series of tests involved a machine called a “random events generator.”Anderson’s task was to tell the computer operator what event and date themachine was spinning out in another room out of sight of the medium. Andersonwas unable to answer accurately when, for example, the random events generatorindicated “July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence.” Anderson replied, “1941.”That was wrong, of course, since December 7, 1941, referred to the attack onPearl Harbor. Strangely the next item to appear was December 7, 1941. And thusthe exercise continued, until the computer scientist realized that the mediumwas answering in the future. So, for example, if the machine generated“1865…President Lincoln assassinated,” Anderson would answer 1492.” The nextitem would be “Columbus…1492.” What had occurred? For whatever reason, themedium was moving into the future by predicting what the machine would generate.As strange as this seems, it was verified. This test also foreshadowed what Armyremote viewer Paul H. Smith would experience in May 1987, when, during atraining session, he remote-viewed an event that actually took place days afterhe viewed it. He next remote-viewed an event that took place in 2016: the closeorbiting of Saturn by the Cassini robotic space probe. Did George Anderson andPaul H. Smith remote view into the future so as to gain impressions in thepresent? Was this just another form of psychic quantum entanglement over timerather than space, a variation of Einstein’s theory, or was it a version ofWerner Heisenberg’s uncertainty theory, in which the future controls the past,also known as retrocausality? Whatever it was, it goes a long way to suggestthat Edison was correct in using quantum theory as a basis for perceivingdisembodied entities, just as Penrose is today.One afternoon, Anderson was being driven by an engineer to a house where he wasto undergo yet another round of tests. A couple of blocks from the location, theengineer thought it would be interesting to find out if Anderson had sufficientclairvoyance to see into the house even though they were still a block away. Thewhite split-level suburban home had its windows covered by drapes. There was noway to see inside.“Can you psychically describe the interior of the place we’re going to?” theengineer asked, pointing to the house as it came into view.Anderson stared at the white-painted building, then said he’d never seenanything like what was inside. He explained that all he saw were “dolls.” Theentire house was covered with what looked like thousands of children’s dolls. Itseemed like an unusual answer.Once the engineer and the medium entered the house, the answer became apparent.The house was, indeed, covered with dolls. They were on shelves, counters, tabletops, sofas, anywhere they could be fit or safely placed. The dolls representedone of the largest private collections in Long Island. Once again, Anderson wascorrect.One night on the radio show a math analyst sat in to determine how accurateAnderson was statistically. The young man employed a computer and strict rulesto learn if the medium could be guessing when he gave callers information suchas names, relationships to deceased loved ones, causes of their passing, evenoccupations. At the end of the session, the analyst concluded that there wasonly a one in more than 4,400 chance that Anderson could be guessing.There were other tests and experiments that found unearthly sounds on tapes madeduring efforts to communicate with the afterlife. One group of experimentsemployed infrared photography that discovered auras around several mediums whilethey were engaged in readings.Remote ViewingThe study of the science of the paranormal, whether called mediumship orclairvoyance, continued through the twentieth century. In fact, such studieswere even funded by the United States intelligence services and by the military.In the 1980s, researchers at the Stanford Research Institute tested celebratedpsychic Ingo Swann, who had approached them with an idea to use what he arguedwere the psychic gifts all human beings possessed to view distant locations andengage in a form of psychic surveillance, which is what some inside the USintelligence community believed the Russians were already doing. This processwas called “controlled” or “coordinate” remote viewing, in which a subject wasnot told what coordinates were in the mind of his or her partner, but simply toopen up one’s mind to what impressions flowed in. In other words, treat the mindas a kind of tuner to pick up a signal. Where the signal came from or what itwas, was not the purpose of the experiment. It was only to record theimpressions as they flowed in.Ingo Swann was so successful at this that the researchers were more thanimpressed. In fact, they tested him by seeing whether he could read or controlthe readings of shielded instruments. When he was able to accomplish this,despite the fact that he could not see the instruments, the researchers wereeven more impressed—so impressed, in fact, that they applied for funding fromthe CIA, using the scientific theory of the “bubble universe” and perhaps stringtheory and quantum entanglement to explain how the process worked. The CIA wasfascinated enough to fund the research. Eventually, a remote-viewing team, nowcalled coordinate remote viewing, because the trainer was only equipped with aset of coordinates on a slip of paper and nothing else, was assembled at FortMeade by the United States Army. According to retired Army major Paul H. Smith,who heads up his own remote-viewing academy, called Remote Viewing InstructionalServices, they met with a success rate beyond the level of chance.70[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-011] In the twenty-first century,remote viewing is a tool of law enforcement agencies, corporate entities, andthe subject of books and movies. It has become popularized.The nexus of retrocausality and remote viewing (neither term was in use at thetime) was tested back in the 1960s with children who were given a singlemarshmallow and told that if they could wait fifteen minutes before eating it,they would get another marshmallow. But if they ate the single marshmallowbefore then, that’s all they would get. While the purpose of the experiment wasto test a child’s ability to assert self-control, to defer a reward for agreater reward in the future, scientists further suggested that the experimentalso indicated a child’s potential to show empathy for his or her future self,neurologically related to self-control on a brain/bio level.71[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-010] However, in terms ofHeisenberg’s theories of uncertainty and physicist Jack Sarfatti’s theory ofretrocausality, that is the future determining the past, the experiment alsoindicated that if a test subject could place his or her future self in front ofa couple of marshmallows, that would determine the test subject’s actions in thepresent. A remote viewer might ask whether this test actually involved asubject’s viewing the future with two marshmallows or one, while a proponent ofHeisenberg or Einstein might ask whether the child in the future had alreadyeaten two marshmallows and, thus, abstained from eating the single marshmallowon the table. The children’s intent about the future governed their actions inthe present, so as to make the present predetermined by the future. Or were thechildren simply driven by their imaginations: two are better than one.There is no question that modern mediumship or modern paranormal has madeprogress not dreamed of a century or more ago. In a sense, the subject of theparanormal had evolved from séance to science. There are still plenty ofskeptics, debunkers, and atheists. However, there are many more scientists todaywho are willing to explore the paranormal. Just as millions have reportednear-death experiences, four out of every ten people claim contact with deceasedloved ones. Science is not as narrow as it once was. Still, no one has inventedanything close to Thomas Edison’s idea for a spirit phone."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15CAN WE TALK TO THE DEAD?EDISON VS. TESLABoth Tesla and Marconi, the acknowledged pioneers in developing wirelesstransmission of electrons, believed that voices from the other side, voices fromthose who had died, could be picked up by radio signals because those signalswere eternal. Tesla even believed that radio waves carrying signals from ETsfrom distant planets could be picked up by receivers at the right frequency, aprecursor to the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence or SETI.Perhaps one of the most astounding aspects of Edison’s attempts to contact thedead was his belief that spirits of the departed wouldn’t bother to move objectsaround or knock on tables to announce their presence. Reacting to the events hehad observed during the Great Age of Spiritualism and the news of the Foxsisters’ claims, Edison wrote his thoughts on life after death in a chapter ofhis diary called The Realms Beyond. (It was subsequently deleted from his diary,called Sundry Observations, by his editor and possibly by members of hisfamily.) Edison, himself, did not delete The Realms Beyond chapter because heheartily believed in the science of quantum physics of his day. However, he didbelieve that such things as Ouija boards, tea leaves, spirit rappings, and othersuch forms of communication were a “waste of time.” He wrote that any proof ofthe afterlife would have to be made on a “scientific basis,” just as chemistryis proven, and not on the claims of individuals who might prey on the needs ofothers. For his part, Edison believed that science was dispassionate and notprone to the desires of those who had special agendas.72[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-009] He had also learned fromexperiments he had performed throughout his life that scientific proof had to berepeatable and not simply a series of one-off events.Edison’s Scientific Predecessors:Tesla and MarconiEdison focused a keen eye on his competitors, notably Marconi and Tesla, both ofwhom developed radio-wave transmission and reception devices. Both inventorsmight have picked up anomalous radio signals on their receivers early on intheir experiments which, according to Tesla, were transmissions from the otherside. Edison mocked Tesla’s claims, but upon hearing them, set about toconstruct his own device that could ping the presence of the departed. In theLost Journals of Nikola Tesla, Edison is quoted by his rival as having“privately believed that Tesla had managed to find the correct frequency toenable communication with spirits of the dead.”73[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-008] Edison was determined todiscover Tesla’s secret and be the first to get the spirit phone on the market.Tesla also believed that Edison was able to communicate with the dead and wrotein his journals that “Thomas Edison had heard from other engineers that Teslahad been receiving mysterious voices and sounds over radio frequencies that werenot conducive for the broadcasting of the human voice.”74[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-007]Edison and his assistant, Dr. Miller Hutchinson, aggressively began to researchthe mechanics of a device to communicate with the dead, about which, Dr.Hutchinson later wrote in his own journal, “Edison and I are convinced that inthe fields of psychic research will yet be discovered facts that will prove ofgreater significance to the thinking of the human race than all the inventionswe have ever made in the field of electricity.”Edison’s Scientific Basis for Communication with the DeadIt was his goal as an inventor, Edison said, to create devices that would servefor others as a type of compass charting paths “upon scientific basis” into theunknown, in this case, the realm of the dead. But there was nothing supernaturalabout Edison’s intent. Instead, he thought of the device as a “valve” which,just like a megaphone that increases the volume of sound, will increase thevolume of the electronic registration of the phenomenon that it detects.Edison said he was drawing a distinction between claiming that a specific humanpersonality survived after death and an attempt to find some evidence of aspirit, a collection of entangled electrons representing what remained of thedeparted. He was actually redefining the concept of a ghost from somethingpurely spiritual into something electrical, the cohesive remains of aconsciousness. The device Edison was developing might have been named a spiritphone, but it was more of a type of radar, a sensor device that would recognizethe presence of a disembodied spirit, register it on a meter, and record itspresence.Relying upon his own extension of Einstein’s special theory of relativity,Edison stated his opinion that life on earth was indestructible, which meantthat life qua life, not the corporeal body but the essence of life, called“units of life,” could neither be destroyed nor created. These units, Edisonbelieved, were smaller than molecules and individual cells. In fact, he wrotethat they comprised the ingredients of cells and were indestructible. Sir RogerPenrose has been reported as having described these as quantum units.Spooky Action at a DistanceHere’s where it gets interesting and comports with what will later become thetheory of quantum entanglement: Einstein’s “spooky action at a distance” theory.Edison said that life units can gather themselves together by the billions andin such a way as to make a human being. Simply stated, and almost in line withthe thinking of his contemporary intellectuals that the unseen was reality andthe visible was distortion, the life units that comprised a human being weresubmicroscopic. Like quanta of matter, Edison had to believe they were there andthat the gatherings of them comprised something we could see, an individualhuman. This was an exciting concept because not only did it comport with thediscoveries and theoretical arguments of physicists of the period, it reflectedEdison’s own interpretation of the biophysiology of that theory and thedeveloping science of genetics. We also should be mindful of the fact thatgeneticists at that time were developing theories of eugenics, the deliberatelyfocused breeding of human beings so as to create superior humans. We all knowhow that turned out.Characterizing his “life units” as electrons, Edison was convinced that millionsof life units comprised a human. Further, because they were electron-likeparticles, they were invisible. Not only that, but they carried electriccharges, wherein each charge was a signal that hailed other signals, all ofwhich possessed a form of memory. He theorized that because the human body canregenerate itself in a healing process, there must be some form of memory in thecells, a memory that probably resides in the electrons that comprise them. Forexample, he theorized that when a person burns his hand, the skin on the handwill eventually grow back in exactly the same way as it did before. How does thebody know how to do that, Edison asked? The body can only do that if itpossesses a memory of what it looked like before the injury. Thus, hepostulated, this memory, if it resides in the electrons as life units, mostlikely exists independent of the body. And, if that’s the case, then it shouldsurvive the body after death, especially because, according to Einstein’stheory, matter cannot be destroyed.A Taxonomy of Life Units and the Asymmetry of the Human BrainPerhaps predicting what would become known as the stem cell theory ofmanipulation of cellular development, Edison argued that there were “workerunits,” those that were the building blocks of what would become a human, and“master units,” those that would govern how the worker units formed up. Thus,ordering the workers into functional structures was the work of master units,which, he also presupposed, might reside in a specific location of the brain, anarea, he said, that is the “seat of personality.” He said this masterpersonality area was likely the Fold of Broca, which neurologists now know iswhere the hard-wired structure of language is located. This area, in aright-handed person, is situated on the left hemisphere of the brain and is alsothe seat of predicative logic and reasoning.The human brain is asymmetrical, that is to say, the two hemispheres havegenerally different functions. The left, in a right-handed person, is the seatof logic and ordered behavior and generally controls or supervises the morecreative and non-ordered ideations on the right hemisphere. This is anoversimplified description, which overlooks the brain’s complexity andplasticity. The two hemispheres are joined together by a bundle of ganglia orneurons known as the corpus callosum, a kind of biological heavy-duty telephonecable or T1 pipe that connects the brain’s motor and cognitive functions.What we know about human development tells us that, as prehistoric human beings,we began to utilize fire to allow clans to own the night, protecting themselvesfrom wild animals, warming themselves, and cooking meat. Civilization ofaffiliated clans began to evolve into hierarchal pack structures. Humans beganto use tools, and the tools they used, worn more on one side than the other,indicated what we call “handedness,” the favoring of one side of the body overanother. This indicated that the two hemispheres of the brain were becomingspecialized; structured language was part of that specialization. Today, this isalso known as predicate organization. We remember predicates from elementaryschool grammar, as in the subject and predicate of a sentence. The subject holdsthe predicate much like a hand holds and wields the tool, much like the logicalstructure of an argument holds the premises and conclusion together. In thisway, Edison was way ahead of his time in that his theories of where the masterlife units resided would later prove to be the explanation of predicativereasoning.Cohesion of Life Units and the Eternityof LifeDo these master units stay together as a collection of entities after the deathof the body or do they dissipate? That was the question that perplexed Edison inthe early 1920s. If the collective units that form a cognitive human being breakup, then there would likely be no life after death. The human consciousness justceases to exist as an organized group of units. In this way, eternal life, whichis the belief system of major religions, would not mean the eternal life of anindividual, but an impersonal constellation of free-floating electron particleswithout a sense of personality.Edison said he hoped that human personality did persist in a cohesive electronicstate after death. This was the primary reason he was creating his apparatus, tomeasure the electronic pulse, the registration of an electronic presence, nomatter how slight, that would assure him of the existence of an eternal life.The life units that Edison hoped to prove lived after the death of the body alsohelped define what some religions called reincarnation. This was another radicalthought that Edison was working through. He said that the same set ofelectronics that might explain the persistence of life units after death mightalso explain how these life units reformed themselves into memories in newbodies. That would explain how a person might have memories, or “flashbacks,” ofanother life. It would be a completely scientific explanation of reincarnation.Edison theorized that we do not actively remember things. It’s the life units,the “little people” in our brains, he said, that provide us with memories. Andthese little people reside in the Fold of Broca. In this he was oversimplifying,because we now know that human memory is a complex process that resides acrossthe brain from short-term or immediate memories to long-term storage in ahierarchical organization. Deep or very long-term memory may reside in part inthe animal portion of our brains, in which the fight or flight emotion islocated. Much of the modern biology of memory was theorized by the psychologistDonald O. Hebb, who is considered by many to be the father of neural networktheory, the basis of today’s computer memory technology.75[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-006] Professor Hebb, whohypothesized that “neurons that fire together, wire together,” also worked forthe CIA during what became known as MK-ULTRA, the manipulation and alteration ofan individual’s memory.Memory and False MemoryNineteenth-century physician and anthropologist Pierre Paul Broca showed thatmuch of what we call memory—he was probably referring to short-termmemory—resided in a strip along the left frontal cortex. These “little men” keptmemory records for us, Edison wrote. Just as in motion pictures, the little mensimply watched, recorded, and replayed. Notice how much Edison’s conceptions ofwhat Broca theorized were governed by his own inventions. Edison pushed thisanalogy further by saying that what we see, our vision, is really a series ofsnapshots or stills of rea­lity that hit the optic nerve and are reassembled inthe brain as motion pictures. As we get older, we may tend to forget thosethings that have not made great impressions on us because our memory records getused up. When we’re young, however, the slightest impressions can fill ourmemory cavities because they are empty at birth. These childhood memories, beingthe first ones in, tend to linger throughout our lives in such a way that evenold people may still react to them as if they were current. Insofar as the brainis concerned, they are.This phenomenon, Edison explained, illustrated a psychological phenomenon thatcan play out in dreams. Imagine dreaming of your former schoolroom and theproportions of your own body to your desk, your chair, or the windows of theclassroom. In your dreams, you are replaying the memories you stored as a child.Now were you to return to that schoolroom as an adult, everything would suddenlybe wrong. The desks would be too small, you wouldn’t fit into the chair, and youwould be the wrong height for the window. All of this might make youuncomfortable. You might ask yourself why, but the answer is that your currentexperience in that classroom doesn’t match up with your memories. As Edisonexplained it, though the memories may remain with you as they were impressedupon you as a child, your body changed as you grew up. The little people in yourbrain do not change. Your body does change, and thus there is disconnect betweenthe little people and the person you are.This phenomenon of incongruent or dyscongruent memory, Edison explained, alsoillustrates how memories update one another. Again, using analogies from hisexperience as the inventor of the recording and communications industries,Edison argued that the little people who store memories have to compare whatmemories reside in the brain with new impressions that come in. Thus, there is aconstant relay interchange that takes place, a set of signals, between storedmemory and new impressions. We use clues to trigger stored memories that we haveburied. When we remember something from the past that’s triggered by somethingfrom the present, it’s as if the memory comes crashing into our consciousness.That’s because the little people who hold the memory shout that memory back intothe person’s consciousness. This is also one of the modern theories behindpost-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, in which an event in the present cantrigger the emotions of the past and govern a response. Where Edison’s theoriesabout the little people who store memories and his life units coincide is in histheory that the little people, the life units, do not disappear after the persondies. Rather, they linger.Thus lingering, the little people can inhabit other bodies so as to preservememories from a former life. In fact, Edison writes, these memories are carriedforward through a succession of lives so that the memories of a person arethemselves immortal. Not only does this explain, for Edison, reincarnation, butit also explains his theory of immortality. This was yet another reason behindEdison’s drive to prove his theories correct with his invention of the spiritphone.The Transmission of Life UnitsIt is here that Edison faced a quandary. If he were correct and therecollections of the little people remain throughout a succession of lives, theneach generation must gain from its own ancestors so as not to make the samemistakes. Given this reason, Edison surmised that the Franco-Prussian war of thelate nineteenth century should not have been repeated in the Great War, WorldWar I. But Europe did not learn. How could this be if Edison’s theory about thepermanent existence of recollections were correct?For an answer, Edison drew on the theory of collective consciousness bypsychiatrist Carl Jung, and argued that some, but not all, of the recollectionscarry over to succeeding generations. This, he said, accounted for “inheritedwisdom.” For example, how does a baby know to close its hands around an extendedfinger from its parent? Although today we might argue that that is a reflexaction based on instinct, Edison argued that it is part of a shared inheritedwisdom, something that remains—call it genetically—from one gene­ration to thenext. In this argument, Edison was also way ahead of his time, even though we’vereplaced his terminology with our own.What he called “inborn traits” were actually “recollections of earlierexperiences that the little people brought along with them.” And he usedexamples to illustrate that different cultures pass along their cultural normsto succeeding generations without actively teaching those norms. Instead, eachgeneration’s observations and inborn traits are incorporated into those of thenext generation. These recollections are what create consciousness, invigoratingthe human body with both sentience and sapience.From a materialistic perspective, Edison perceived the indivi­dual human as a“machine,” in his words, that was composed of millions of life units or littlepeople who comprised the sum total of the person’s memories and emotionalresponses based upon those stored memories. Just like an extension of both aFreudian theory and a Jungian theory, the individual person’s reactions andmotivations were governed by his or her memories, which were actually lifeunits, electrons. But like Jungian theory, these life units were shared amongindividuals, hence the idea of a collective human belief system. Moreover, froman Einsteinian perspective, because the life units were matter and could not bedestroyed, if they remained together, joined by a spooky attractive force, thenit might be possible to perceive them as a personality surviving the death ofthe body machine. In other words, if Edison’s spirit phone worked as he intendedit to, then it would prove that life does not cease to exist at the point ofbody death. The apparatus, Edison theorized, would also help him prove histheory about the mystery and origin of life, not just about death. Edison arguedthat when we see an individual human being, or an animal, or a plant, we seethat individual as a unit. This, he believed, was false. Because life units canexist independently of the human body, they exit that body upon the body’s deathand pass into another habitat, almost like a virus that spreads to a new host.From the perspective of reincarnation, Edison wrote, they might become theanimating force of another machine.Migration of Life UnitsThe principle of life units also gave rise to another Edison theory concerningwhat he formerly lamented as the “cruelty of nature.” But nature was not reallycruel, in his opinion. It was merely the action of some life units transferringto another habitat upon the destruction of the machine they originallyinhabited. He used the example of the shark that eats the cod. The cod may die,but it is only the flesh. The life units that make up the cod simply inhabit,co-join, the life units of the shark. Hence there is no death of theindestructible life units, only a recombination. This theory also explained muchNative American lore that one is what one eats. If one eats the heart of thewolf, one becomes like the wolf by incorporating its spirit. If we look at thespirit as Edison’s life units, there is a materialistic basis for what would beNative American spiritual beliefs.In his theory of life units, Edison mused upon the smallness of the units he wasdescribing and came to the conclusion that if we view them as electronicparticles, whose existence had already been proven, then there is no longer aquestion about seeing these life units with a microscope. We know they existbecause electricity exists. This was another aspect of the rationale for hisspirit apparatus.Edison was so convinced of his theory of life units that he believed he couldalso demonstrate proof of the subconscious mind, which was promulgated by Freudat the turn of the century. Edison suggested that notions of good and bad,therefore, were really determined by the nature and number of the master builderlife units, those that control the life units. But where do they come from? Dothey come from inside the sperm and the egg in which a nucleus is fertilized,thus giving rise to the offspring? For Edison, and this also explains therationale for his spirit phone, the answer was a flat-out no.Because life units can live outside the body and because, in his words, they can“prowl about the atmosphere,” he believed they existed independently in a formof ether. Does that mean that the origin of life, because the electrons canneither be created nor destroyed, is outside the body? Perhaps life came toearth from outer space. He wrote that, as the earth cooled from its fierybeginnings in the solar system, the units of life came to earth from another,more advanced planet. This was a theory advanced by Lord Kelvin, among others,and was probably part of the scientific scholarship that influenced Edison. Itis probably this reasoning, something completely non-Christian, that motivatedEdison’s descendants and successors in interest to delete this chapter fromlater editions of his published diary. Edison’s idea of migrating life units,however, was far ahead of its time and preceded Crick’s and Watson’s theory ofpanspermia. If we someday in the very near future find fossilizedquasi-terrestrial life forms on Mars, for example, or even among thehydrothermal vents on the Saturnian moon Enceledus, perhaps not only Crick andWatson, but Edison, too, will be proven correct in this theory of the migrationof life units.Edison and Wilhelm ReichThese life units were eminently adaptable and upon reaching our now-coolingplanet, simply adapted to the chemistry of our world and our atmosphere, thuscreating life on planet Earth. This postulate involves an understanding of howthese life units travel. If they are bound only to travel through an atmosphere,then they are limited by the confines of that atmosphere. However, if they cantravel through ether, the popular term also used by Wilhelm Reich to explain histheory of biological energy or Orgone, then they are not confined by ouratmosphere.Reich was a psychiatrist who had been a member of Freud’s circle of confidants,colleagues, and students, and sought to explain the nature of how neuroses aretransmitted, almost like pathogens. He believed in the existence of a conductingdevice in what he called the ether, and named that conducting medium Orgone.From Edison’s ideas concerning the transmission and travel of life units throughether, it seems plausible that he was influenced by Freud’s and Reich’sruminations on how the unseen forces that govern human behavior and comprisecharacter and personality migrate.For the sake of argument, and assuming that Edison’s theory of life units hadplausibility, we ask, and he asked as well, are life units not onlyindestructible but immutable? If immutable, how does that account for thediversity of life on earth? Edison suggested that because life units areadaptable to their environment, as the environment changes, or evolves, so dothe life units that comprise the separate organisms.This adaptability enabled him to explain that although an elephant is anelephant is an elephant, the wooly mammoth is not the same elephant found inAfrica or Asia. As the earth warmed from the Ice Age, a wooly outer layer on theelephant became unnecessary. Thus, the life units adapted to the new climate andthe elephant lost its wool. How Darwinian is that? We can see via thesearguments how Edison was a thinker of his age who amalgamated the theories ofthe day to advance theories that are only now being taken as good science.Having established his postulates about the nature of life units, theirmigration through space to form life on earth, and their indestructibility andability to exist in cohesive swarms absent the corporeal body, Edison turned tohis next important principle—that we can communicate with the dead."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16THE SPIRIT PHONE APPARATUS:THE PRINCIPLE AND DESIGN“I cannot conceive of such a thing as a spirit,” Edison once wrote in hisdiary.76 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-005]Edison didn’t think invisible spirits could make raps on walls or tilt tables.However, although he did not think that what we call “personalities” passed to“another sphere” upon death, he did think they could be contacted by anapparatus. This apparatus had to be delicate and sensitive to the slightestperturbations in the electronic envelope that surrounds us all, his version ofthe Force or the Vril. Its purpose would be to register the presence of theseperturbations to see whether, against the background noise, something cohesivestood out on a meter. Moreover, Edison believed that if he could construct sucha device, it might not only be able to identify the existence of a cohesion ofelectrons, but allow that cohesion, assuming that that cohesion actually formeda personality, to “express itself” to those tracking it. His apparatus would bebased upon science and not subjective impressions of clairvoyants or mediums.Bringing Science to MediumshipEdison confessed to future readers that it was not the idea of life after deathin principle that he was challenging, it was the unscientific and crude methodsof communication employed by self-proclaimed spirit guides that he rejected.Poltergeists, for example, seeking to make their presence known to the living,would simply be wasting their time knocking things about. Edison’s method wouldprovide a clear and objective means of communication, like a telegraph ortelephone, open to no misinterpretation. The field of psychic interpretationwould grow in legitimacy by leaps and bounds once the science of electroniccommunication were applied to it, he wrote. And in this, again, Edison wasblending the cultural trends of spiritualism and scientific industrialism into asingle piece of electronics whose proof of concept would, he believed, satisfypractitioners in both fields.The apparatus, Edison believed, would have the effect of magnifying human effortto open a doorway—Edison called it a “valve”—into another realm. Like a modernpowerhouse, a gene­rating plant that moves electricity along a grid, his devicewould act as a turbine magnifying the input force, in this case the appea­ranceof free-floating electrically charged life units, to a meter that would displayits presence. Once registered on a meter, the event would be recorded. Hence,Edison asserted, the user would have a record of the appearance of the spiritvia an apparatus that would return scientifically repeatable results every timeit was used. Just imagine, using science to prove about the hereafter whatheretofore was completely unscientific. By merging the dominant cultural,scientific, and intellectual trends of the times, Edison was more than a man ofhis time, he was displaying his intent to become a man of the future.Edison’s Design versus Tesla and MarconiWhereas Tesla and Marconi believed they could construct receivers that wouldpick up radio waves from the other side, Edison thought that the presence oflife units would provide impressions from the other side. This was a fundamentaldiffe­rence between the theories of electric signaling. Tesla’s theories ofvoices from the other side were predictive of the modern practices of listeningfor EVP, or voices of the dead, while Edison’s theory was predictive of “spookyaction at a distance” or quantum entanglement.Steps to Construction of the Spirit PhoneEdison’s next step would be to construct the apparatus. Electricity wouldgenerate the power to project a tightly constrained photon beam at aphotoelectric cell that would register the impact of those photons on a surfacemedium. The photoelectric cell was connected to a meter that would then registerwhatever passed through that beam, so as to distinguish the effect from anybackground radio waves, and record the interruption of the beam. So far, sogood, but Edison would still have to know that a cohesion of life units wasactually present and could be summoned across the beam instead of sitting aroundand waiting for a random spirit to present itself for inspection andregistration. In this, he claimed, he was fortunate in that a person with whomhe had been collaborating on this device had unfortunately just died. Butinasmuch they had been working together, Edison felt that that spirit of thejust-departed should be the first entity to register himself upon the newapparatus.Cautious about the capabilities of the apparatus, Edison charac­terized his workas giving psychic investigators a means of scientific proof of the afterlife,just as a microscope gave biologists proof of the existence of organisms theycould not see with the naked eye but knew were present. Microscopes used opticsto make what was unseen seen. In this way, Edison’s apparatus also used optics,light, to make what is only perceived psychically, regis­tered electronically.Edison and GeneticsEdison also articulated another theory in regard to the structure of electroniclife units. And we also have to be aware that he is making this argument at atime when the entire study of genetics and an organized human genome was beingresearched. In fact, the 1920s in Europe and America was a time in which notonly was genetics being studied, but some biologists were arguing for thepractice of eugenics to improve the human race and epigenetics to explain howcertain seemingly acquired traits were passed from generation to generation.77[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-004] Edison, although not arguingfor the theory of epigenetics, did come up with the theory that the organizationof human beings into hierarchical structures mirrored the way life unitsorganized themselves into hierarchical structures in a human being. In otherwords, in arguing that the organized structure of human society, with itsmanagers and workers, is a reverse projection of the organization of the lifeunits within the individual human, Edison was predicting the theory of fractalmathematical representation, a form of scalability or a recursion theory inwhich ontogeny—the organization of the one—follows phylogeny—the organization ofthe many.Finally, in arguing for the theory of what spiritualists call migration of thesoul, Edison stated that life units are indefatigable entities, always seekingthe opportunity to work. Plus, they are indestructible. Thus, when the bodymachine dies, the life units seek out another body machine to inhabit. In otherwords, there is a migration of the soul, not on a spiritual level, but on abioelectrical level for which hard science can account. Moreover, because thereis a fixed number of life units, they recirculate, inhabiting human flesh andblood over and over again, only in different bodies. Hence, there is anelectrical theory to support Jung’s contention of a collective unconscious ofshared symbology and ideas that resonate through cultures.Finally, Edison turned his attention to the nature of persona­lity itself. Afterall, if life units recirculate from biological machine to biological machine,how do different personalities form up out of the same soup of life units? Histheory presupposed that the life entities recombine in different proportionswhen they migrate. They, like Einstein’s mass, never go out of existence, butlike swarms of bees from different hives, they can form new hives and newhierarchical structures, and assemble different combinations to form differentpersonalities. Thus, Edison suggested that by registering the presence of thesecohesions of life entities, his apparatus would prove not only the existence oflife forces after death, but, by allowing the electrons to communicate with theoperator of the apparatus at the other end, might be able to display lingeringpersonality traits in a type of Morse code. Seems like a stretch, but toEdison’s mind it was a worthwhile experiment, given the theories of his day.Now it was time for building the apparatus, something that Edison described inhis journal as the “most sensitive apparatus I have ever undertaken to build,and I await the results with the keenest interest.”78[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-003]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17THE DEVICE AND THE SKEPTICSThe first official independent article about his spirit phone, one not writtenby Edison, appeared in the October 1933 edition of Modern Mechanix. In thatarticle, Edison described to an interviewer his first public experiment with theapparatus in 1920, and also explained how the device worked. In that experiment,Edison invited only those he trusted, what Modern Mechanix referred to as histrusted “mystic clan” of scientists. Although we do not know exactly whathappened that night, except that the magazine reported that the experiment didnot reveal the presence of any spirits, the story goes that Edison hadconstructed an arrangement of a photoelectric cells that was supposed toregister a narrow beam of light projected upon it from a lamp set up a shortdistance away. The room was dark, so that only the beam of light could be seenby the onlookers.When the beam of light struck the photoelectric cell, the cell transformed thebeam into an electric current wired to a meter. Any interference with the beamwould register on the cell, and a needle would move on the meter in response tothe interruption of the beam. Although the apparatus seemed basic, it wasingenious in theory because it presupposed that something unseen would still beperceived by the stream of photons hitting the cell. For the experiment to work,though, Edison had to make sure that he had a cohesion of life units, a spirit,from a departed person crossing the beam. For that, he had to rely upon theclaims of spiritualists, mediums, who promised him that they could summon thedeparted. Though Edison was a staunch denier of the abilities of mediums, howelse would he be able to find subjects to cross the beam of light unless he hada way to summon them in the first place? Thus, the premise of the experiment, ifnot of the device itself, was to amalgamate the materialistic—a cohesion ofentangled life units—with the spiritualistic—an actual séance to summon thedeparted.The experiment began. The mediums commenced whatever trancelike induction theyneeded to reach out to the spirit world to see who was navigating nearby in theether. This was less like magic and more like a true psychological event. Asthey performed the machinations they needed to reach the spirit world, thescientists watched the meter to look for any interruption of the stream ofphotons.Hours passed as the spiritualists kept reaching out with their invocations. Thedial on the meter did not budge. As the night wore on, it was becoming clear thespiritualists were not able to summon any entities. The scientific skepticsamong them thought there were simply no entities to summon in the first place.As ingenious as Edison’s concept might have been, and even if there were spiritsof the departed nearby, they simply could not be coerced into taking part in theexperiment. For whatever reason, the experiment was not working. Thus, therewere at least four basic theories concerning his failed experiment: 1. The mediums could not summon any spirits. 2. There are no such things as life units of the departed. 3. Even if there were spirits and life units present, they simply did not register on the photoelectric cell even if they interrupted the beam. 4. Even if there were spirits present and even if they could be summoned, the premise of the spirit phone was faulty and there was no physical matter to interrupt the beam.For Edison, the failure of his experiment was not a devastating shock. First ofall, he was used to failure. He often said that failure simply meant that hecould eliminate one process or type of engineering project from his theory andmove on to the next. Therefore, he didn’t abandon his theory that life unitsremained after the death of the flesh. It simply meant that whatever his devicewas supposed to detect, either the spiritualists weren’t capable of doing whatthey said they could do, or the machine itself needed a different method ofdetecting what he believed present and active in all of us.Edison had argued that he had proof of the existence of life units that couldreform even after the flesh was destroyed. He used the example of a fingerprint.He wrote and told others that the fingerprints of an individual were unique. Notwo people had the same fingerprint. And if the tip of the finger upon which theprint existed were burned so that the fingerprint was obliterated, when the scartissue finally healed and the fingertip returned to its normal state, the samefingerprint would reappear exactly as it had been. To demonstrate this as aproof of concept, not only of the healing of the flesh but of the presence ofindestructible life units, Edison first took his own fingerprint to get acontrol specimen. Then he burned that fingertip severely. When the scar began todecay as the burn healed, Edison pulled off the tissue and had anotherfingerprint taken. Lo and behold, he was able to show that the new fingerprintwas exactly the same as the original one. The life units repaired the skin inexactly the same way. Hence, for Edison, this was proof of the concept that lifeunits existed and were indestructible. Therefore, it was not the theory that wasat fault, it was either the design of the device or the inability of the mediumsto summon the spirits.Edison and ExtraterrestrialsEdison gave his interviewer at Modern Mechanix another example of his life unittheory. Suppose, he asked, that an extraterrestrial being from another world hadeyes that were incapable of perceiving anything smaller than large structures.It could see buildings and large statues, but nothing smaller. Now suppose thatsame extraterrestrial came to Earth and could see the Brooklyn Bridge, but notthe people walking across it. Then what if, somehow, something destroyed thebridge and the extraterrestrial could see it was no longer there. Now supposeNew York construction crews rebuilt the bridge. To the extraterrestrial, thebridge simply reappeared, just like Edison’s fingerprint after he had burned itoff. Might the extraterrestrial then believe that something unseen had rebuiltthe bridge, even though it did not see that process take place. This, Edisonsaid, was exactly what happened with the life units. They work invisibly, butall we can see is the results of their work. By perceiving their results, heargued, we therefore have a proof of concept that life units exist and shape,form, and animate the human machine and all other forms of life on Earth.Clearly, Edison, ahead of the wave of twentieth-century biological science, hadcome up with a theory that would later be proven to be true: gene theory andcellular memory.Unfortunately, Edison’s life-unit-theory experiment could not account for thepresence of life units after death of the entire body, nor could it account forthe possibility that an electronic device could perceive the presence of theseswarms of life units. This was perhaps the reason why Edison never fullyrevealed to the public the work he was doing on his spirit machine, only sharingit with a few trusted colleagues and those he believed honest enough to bearwitness to its success, were that success to have been proven. But that did notstop skeptics from dubbing his experiments as a ghost phone or telephone to thedead.Puritan AmericaDespite the failure of his experiment, Edison still clung to the belief thatlife existed after death and that science could prove it. But America was stilla Puritan country in the 1920s. Ghosts, spirits, and the idea of communicatingwith the departed were all pushed to the margins as industrialized Americainvested in itself with money it didn’t have. By the late 1920s, althoughEdison’s energy and capacity for creativity might have been in decline, he wasstill a legendary industrialist as well as an inventor. As public figures, thosewho sought profit from the industries he created wanted no part of spiritualism,and told him so when news of his spirit phone experiments leaked out. Therefore,all records of his experiments with the spirit machine were wiped away.There is another issue that might have arisen regarding Edison’s theories aboutlife units, one that involved how these units arrived on Earth. Edison wrote inhis diary (and these remarks were stricken in later editions) that he believedit possible that life units were also carried to earth by some extraterrestrialforce, a precursor to the theory of panspermia. Were that the case, it wouldhave given a purely materialistic, albeit extraterrestrial, theory for thecreation of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere in the universe. For the headof a major company such as General Electric and a child of devout Methodistparents, this was pure heresy. Not only was Edison writing something that flewin the face of the Judeo-Christian story of creation; he had traversed into therealm of science fiction. For the most practical of inventors, this was a greatleap into what his family considered to be fantasy. All of this was beforeEdison claimed that he had what we now call a near-death experience.Edison’s Near-Death ExperienceOn his death bed in 1931, Edison lapsed into what his family thought was a coma.His breathing slowed and those at his bedside thought that this was the end. Butsuddenly, Edison roused himself, opened his eyes and, with the lucidity of ahealthy man, spoke. He told his family that he had been to the other side. Hisvoice was full of hope. He had seen what it was like after the death of thebody, what the hereafter was like: a blissful place. But the true happiness inEdison’s voice in his final moments was that he knew for certain, knew in a waythat no scientific experiment could possibly prove, that there was consciousnessafter death. He had discovered, at the very point of death, we don’t die."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18WHAT HAPPENED TO EDISON’S LAST INVENTION?In 1920, Thomas Edison revealed that he was building a machine that he believedcould contact the dead. He also revealed that he had demons­trated his design toscientists and employed the expertise of mediums to summon the departed to testthe machine. In Tesla’s journals, he referred to Edison’s building a machine tocontact the dead. With all evidence, albeit anecdotal, one question remains,what happened to the spirit phone?Was It a Joke or Hoax to Confound Tesla?There are some Edison scholars who argue that the spirit phone never existed,that it was a hoax perpetrated by Edison upon his gullible interviewers atModern Mechanic magazine. Even though the apparatus seemed simple in design (amotion-picture projector-like device that focused a narrow beam of light upon aphotoelectric cell wired to a meter to register any interruption), the fact thatthe device was never officially put on display or demonstrated to the publicmade it seem as if Edison had either failed or was making a joke for his fans.But Edison did not joke about his inventions. In fact, a dour Thomas Edison didnot joke at all, except to laugh at Tesla’s demand for payment of $50,000 forhis repair of a generator. Whatever his humor might have been, when it came toinventions that he believed would satisfy a consumer market, Edison was strictlyserious. Accordingly, we have to wonder not only whatever became of the device,but why was Edison’s chapter on the spirit world and life after death excisedfrom his diary when it was published by his family?As Edison’s health declined in the late 1920s, his businesses were prospering.The recording industries were making technological advances, such as convertingcylinders to disks that could be pressed by the thousands; the motion-pictureindustry now had talking movies, and studios were being rewired for sound bypioneers like NBC founder David Sarnoff in his work with Joe Kennedy, Sr., atRKO; municipal power grids were being expanded to more and more cities; and thetransportation system was being electrified. Edison’s General Electric Company,GE, which had begun in 1890, by the start of the First World War in 1914 hadbecome a defense contractor, manufacturing warplanes for the Army Air Force. Bythe late 1920s, Edison had even brought early experimentation in plastics to hiscompany. In short, Edison had gone from being a lone inventor to the head of aninvention factory, to a corporate personality with far more at stake than just asingle invention. Edison had joined the ranks of entrepreneurs such as JudgeThomas Mellon, Andrew Carnegie, George Westinghouse, and John D. Rockefeller.Inventions as Edison’s Private PassionEven though Edison had brought the age of electricity to consumer America, heremained an inventor at heart, pushing the envelope to find new pockets of needfor inventions. However, by the 1920s, the private Edison the inventor and thepublic Edison the corporate businessman found that sometimes the lattercompromised the former. By the time he had become corporate, it seemed thatEdison was not allowed to fail. There were simply too many people, investors andbusiness associates, on the line with him. When one is the personality upon whomthe value of publicly held shares of stock depends—consider the personas of BillGates and Steve Jobs—that person must walk a fine line between safe continuityand the risk-tinged potential of reward. Look at the fights between Steve Jobsand John Scully: the former, who founded Apple, arguing that the company’sfuture lay in the development of the Macintosh, while the latter saw the safeincome stream of the Apple II as the company’s life blood. That same type ofconflict might have torn at Edison internally. He wanted to determine whetherthe dead could make their presence known to the living, but he also had tomaintain his role as the corporate celebrity upon whom entire industriesdepended. Therefore, it would not be surprising that his failure to develop anapparatus to communicate with the dead would be seen as a detriment by those whodepended upon his renown, and thus all records of that failure had to beexpunged. And we’re also assuming, for the sake of argument and with lack of anyevidence to the contrary, that it was a failure.But what if it wasn’t?What If the Spirit Phone Actually Worked?What if, upon a subsequent night with a different group of mediums or trancechannelers, Edison managed to get a registration on the dial of his apparatus?We know that he described exactly how he would build it and we know theprinciple behind it. Therefore, suppose that there were spirits, or cohesivelife units of the departed who had crossed the beam. Would Edison have broughtthose results to the public or would the board of directors of General Electricor of any other Edison-related businesses have advised him against doing so? Thethought that a person could scientifically prove the existence of spirits, asopposed to a faith-based belief, would be like a Dr. Frankenstein creating lifefrom the dead in a laboratory. Just imagine what would have happened had thefounder of General Electric suddenly announced that he could communicate withthe dead. Would it be a boon to his company or would organized religion comedown upon him like the pillars of Sampson? This would have been choice faced bythose responsible to the GE stockholders.Although we have no proof one way or the other, are there any similar situationswe can refer to as examples of how advanced research into areas consideredparanormal were suppressed by the government? The answer is yes, there is anexample that took place over a decade after Edison’s death in 1931. It was in1943, after the death of Edison’s old rival, Nikola Tesla.Tesla’s Anti-Gravity NotesTo understand the import of what took place in the final years of Nikola Tesla’slife, and his attempts to get the US military to fund his research into advancedweaponry in the years after the beginning of World War II, we have to look at anattempt that Tesla made to offer advanced weapons to the Navy at the advent ofWorld War I. At the time, the person advising the Naval Consulting Board wasThomas Edison. We have already covered what writers such Margaret Cheney wrotein regard to the “battle of the currents,” when Edison and Tesla argued over theefficacy of direct current versus alternating current.79[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-002] And we know that even beforeTesla came to America, he had proclaimed his wish to work for and with ThomasEdison, the master of his age. However, as Margaret Cheney documented, the storyof Tesla’s proffering advanced weapons technology to the Naval Consulting Boardis not well known.As Europe was gearing up for war, Tesla proposed a number of advanced weapons tothe Naval Research Board. Perhaps the most important were directed-energyweapons, beams of electrons fired with such high intensity that they could betargeted quickly, didn’t have to be reloaded, and could fire with pinpointaccuracy. These are the very types of weapons proposed today for the SixthGene­ration fighter now on the drawing boards at Northrup Grumman and for thenext generation of warships. Used at sea, directed-energy weapons would enable asingle warship to engage multiple targets simultaneously from any angle andposition. Today, just to prove the viability of Tesla’s theoretical use ofparticle-beam weaponry, the Army has developed directed microwave weapons forthe purposes of crowd control which, when aimed at a human target, heats up theperson’s skin to the point of intolerable pain, thereby rendering a hostileperson immobile or sending him or her into flight.The other superweapons that Tesla proposed were robotically guided torpedoes andwarships. And we have also seen the flaw in early radio-controlled devices thatcould not cloak their frequencies so as to prevent them from being jammed by theenemy. It took Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil to fix that problem, but onlydecades later. The robotically guided artificially intelligent underwater droneis actively undergoing development today by the US and Russian navies. Tesla haddemonstrated his radio-guided robotic devices at Madison Square Garden in 1898.Even today he is known as the Father of Robotics. Tesla’s radio-guided warshipand torpedo might have given the allies an early advantage in the North Atlanticwar against German U-boats. But it was not to be.Tesla’s weapons concepts, although more in the planning than physicaldevelopment stages, nevertheless represented the brilliance of his theories ofphysics and electrical engineering.Always looking for investors in his technology, Tesla had bounced them offfinanciers J. P. Morgan and George Westinghouse during his most productiveyears, but he usually managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory because,he claimed, the people he was selling to never really understood his ideas. Forexample, unlike his nemesis Thomas Edison, who understood market needs anddeveloped inventions to fill those needs, Tesla thought too far ahead. Heforesaw needs that would come to be in the distant future and developedtechnologies for them. But, as George Westinghouse once told Tesla, who wasextolling the promise of free energy, why would anyone invest in something thatwould make no money for its investors in a market no one understood?Wireless ElectricityPerhaps the best example of Tesla’s optimism when it came to his inventions wasthe wireless transmission of electricity. Who needed wires, he believed, when hewould harness lightning in a bottle, direct it toward receivers, and light thelights of cities in the same way he and Marconi had developed wirelesscommunication? But, as Westinghouse explained when Tesla asked him to invest inhis wireless transmission technology, what was the point of transmittingelectricity wirelessly without meters? Why give it away for free? Free energywas a pipe dream, because how could an industrialist make money from it? Thiswas the core of Tesla’s problem when it came to raising money. Yet today,according to Cathal O’Connell’s February 24 article in Cosmos, researchers atthe Wireless Systems group at the Walt Disney Company’s Disney’s Researchdivision, developed a method of using magnetic fields to transmit power toelectronic devices wirelessly. It was Tesla’s research in power transmission,Disney scientists said, that inspired them to use magnetic fields to transmitenergy.His financial problems were also at the forefront when he approached the NavalBoard with his advanced weaponry. Edison rejected Tesla’s plans for thewireless-directed energy-beam weapon and robot-guided torpedo as not feasible.It was his revenge, some historians say, for Tesla’s winning the contract tolight the turn-of-the-century Chicago World’s Fair with alternating currentinstead of Edison’s direct current.Tesla’s Last Invention: AntigravityBy 1940, Tesla was living alone in a room in Manhattan’s New Yorker Hotel.Europe, again, had gone to war and Tesla, again, had an advanced technologicalweapon, an antigravity device, that he was trying to sell to the United StatesArmed Services. Nikola Tesla theorized that electrically excited quartzcrystals, at the correct frequency, could be directed to levitate an object tothe point where it would overcome the force of gravity. When applied to weaponstechnology, Tesla said, antigravity would be the device to end all war, freeinghumanity from the confines of the earth. In fact Ralph Ring, who appeared onHistory Channel’s documentary series “UFO Hunters,” said on camera that he wasonce solicited by businessman and engineer Otis Carr, who claimed he had workedwith Tesla. Carr asked Ring to be a crew member of a flying craft, anantigravity device that Carr had built according to Tesla’s antigravity notes.Ring explained that without any sensation of motion whatsoever, the craft thathe was on transported itself ten miles. Ring could not explain the technologybehind it except to say that Otis Carr had been friends with Tesla andunderstood his theories.At the outset of World War II, Tesla was so enthusiastic about his antigravitydevice that he tried to obtain a grant from the United States Department of Warfor weapons development. But he was turned down, this time not by Edison, whohad died over a decade earlier, but by the Department of War itself.Disconsolate, Tesla turned his attention to the Soviet Union, at that pointfacing the imposing might of Hitler’s Wehrmacht. Anxious for new weaponry, theSoviet Union saw the practicality of an antigravity device and awarded Tesla agrant of $25,000 for the development of the apparatus. Unfortunately, Tesla wastoo ill to get the job done, and passed away in January 1943.Tesla’s grant from the Soviet Union did not go unnoticed by J. Edgar Hoover, thedirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After Tesla’s death, FBI agentsraided his hotel room and secured all of his notes, including his antigravityplans and schematics, which they turned over to the custody of the Office ofAlien Properties. After the war ended in 1945, the newly formed country ofYugoslavia demanded the return of Tesla’s notes for a museum they were buildingin his honor in Belgrade. The Office of Alien Properties turned over the bulk ofTesla’s materials to the new museum, but held back, perhaps as a matter ofnational security, Tesla’s notes on antigravity. Instead, these notes were sentto General Nathan Twining at the Air Materiél Command at Wright Field outside ofDayton, Ohio. Twining, as mentioned earlier, was the general apprised of the UFOcrash at Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947. Debris from that alien crash wassent for analysis to Wright Field, where in spring of 1948 a class from theNational Air War College not only handled the strange material retrieved fromRoswell, but saw and communicated with the live alien who survived the crash.80[../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-001]Government Secrecy a Potent ForceThe point of this Tesla anecdote is not to reinforce the story of the crash atRoswell. Truth can stand on its own over time and often needs no reinforcement.Rather, it is to point out that when the government seeks to keep an inventionfrom the public, it can do so without too much of a cover-up. After all, eventhough we know that Tesla believed he had developed an antigravity device, andwe know he had developed radio-guided robotic devices and directed energyparticle-beam weaponry, it is his antigravity device that is not in use today.At least we don’t think it is. And so, we believe, it was the same with ThomasEdison’s spirit phone. That invention was so far ahead of its time and posed somuch of a challenge to organized religion of the day that, even if only for thegood of his companies, those running them after his death deemed it best not torelease the information.Faith-Based Communication with the DepartedIt is ironic that the major religions have a faith-based belief in the survivalof the soul after the body dies. Christians may seek the help of saints, otherreligions may worship ancestors, still other forms of devotion may worshipdeities of nature. However, when it comes to making actual physical contact withthe departed, that is normally condemned as heresy or the work of the devil.This, we believe, is why, whether or not Edison actually succeeded in getting aregistration on his spirit phone, no physical records of that device exist. Wemay adhere to our faith and treasure our science, but, even in today’stechnological society, the two very rarely mix."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19THE LEGACY OF THOMAS EDISON: SUCCESSES, FAILURES, CONTROVERSIES, MEANINGSThomas Edison has reached the rare pinnacle of American sainthood, having beenso translated by science and literary historians whose hagiographies of thegreat inventor focus on his genius, foresight, and skill. But the version ofThomas Edison’s life so promulgated is mostly based on a sanitized history ofthe man whose otherwise outlier beliefs are excised from the official story. Hislegacy is almost immeasurable because he literally created thecommunications-based society that we live in today. His inventions definedmodern society, which, in turn, defines us. Therefore, his experimentation witha spirit phone, though it might seem enigmatic, was actually a logical extensionof his attempt to push the envelope of reality to a new frontier.Whether the spirit phone worked or not; whether the spirits of the departed areactually cohesive life units or not; whether, during that all-important firsttest at the beginning of the 1920s, spirits were actually summoned by mediumsand clairvoyants and crossed the photon beam of Edison’s device or not, none ofthis detracts from the lasting effects Edison had not only upon Americansociety, but upon the world. Just in terms of his two major entertainmentindustry inventions, the phonograph and the motion-picture camera and projector,Edison’s work turned America into a powerhouse of worldwide social culture. Itstill resonates today.Legacy of Thomas EdisonRegardless of spirit phone proof of concept, the legacy of Thomas Edison hasbecome an American legend, the story of our society as well as the personaltriumph of Edison. For example, Edison’s family’s social ascendance was aquintessential American story about the rise of a family from the working classto industrial and governing elite. Sam Edison, a Canadian immigrant, was ahardscrabble shopkeeper and laborer. His son, Thomas, a scientist, invented thetwentieth century, pointed America to the next century, and was one of hissociety’s greatest industrialists. Sam Edison’s grandson, Thomas’s son Charles,became the governor of New Jersey, the Edisons’ adopted state.Thomas Edison’s legacy involves the three century-defining and social-definingindustries that he created: recording, motion pictures, communications, andmunicipal electrical power grid.And his merging of the recording and picture and communications industries,distributing content along an ancillary grid as part of a municipal power grid,laid out the basis for today’s Internet.Scientia Vincit OmniaOne of the lasting social effects that Thomas Edison left us was his belief thatscience can solve problems, even problems of the spirit. This was the essence ofhis spirit phone, to use science to prove that there is a reality to the spiritthat’s measurable and with which we can communicate. This was the holy grail ofhis, and Tesla’s, final years. The fact that we have no records of Edison’sdevice’s success doesn’t alter his belief that it was possible. At the least,Roger Penrose provides a quantum-based explanation of consciousness and thepossibility that it lingers in an entangled quantum state after the body’sdeath. We know that Edison had a deep belief in the power of science to find thetruth about life after death. We know that he reiterated to his followers and toaudiences that the soul is immortal and we do not die. Though a materialist, hebelieved that using science to reveal the unseen in our reality was doable.Edison was also one of the most important harbingers of the age of modernindustrialism. Although Age of Science and Industrialism itself began in thenineteenth century, by the early twentieth century there was a new burst ofindustrialism that embraced the science of mass production and manufacturing aswell as the sciences of theoretical physics and medicine and the science of masscommunication. In this new age of industrial science, Edison, Harvey Firestone,Henry Ford, David Sarnoff, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Mellon, and AndrewCarnegie were all the industrial and financial barons who helped invent thecentury and create the environment that is still with us today. But it wasEdison, only, who was the first to create an assembly line of science as opposedto an assembly line of product. Where Ford was able to marshal the skills oflaborers to downstream the fabrication of automobiles, Edison took it one stepfurther and worked from the stage of actual creation of the idea—the applicationof science to a market-fulfilling product—to the mechanism for mass producingthe proof of concept. In this he was one of the most creative businesspersonalities of his age.In fact, even while he was alive, but certainly after he died, Thomas Edison wasone of the few people who actually reached a form of American sainthood, if thatis possible. He did this by surmounting his own humanity, his foibles anddownright weaknesses, and through legend and lore was transmogrified.Glorified by the Motion-Picture IndustryThe very industry that Edison created, motion pictures, bestowed upon him itsown version of sainthood with two biographical films. In 1940, nine years afterEdison’s death, Louis Mayer’s MGM made two motion pictures about the greatinventor, films that were headed up by the most valuable talent the studio hadunder contract at the time—Mickey Rooney in Young Tom Edison and Spencer Tracyin Edison the Man. These two films were hagiographic pieces, the first withMickey Rooney playing the inquisitive youth always getting into trouble butultimately always doing the right thing. The second looked at Edison in 1929,just two years away from his death, standing at a testimonial awards dinner inwhich he looks back on his life.For the making of Young Tom Edison, it was necessary that the Edison home andlaboratory in Port Huron, Michigan, be recreated from whatever could berelocated from Menlo Park and Fort Myers, where Edison had lived next to HenryFord. Ford took the motion picture so seriously that he actually wanted the filmto be shot in Edison’s home of Port Huron and, to facilitate that, he arrangedon his own dime to have the entire Edison laboratory relocated and restaged atPort Huron.81 [../Text/Edison-v-Tesla_0029.xhtml#footnote-000] Afterwards, Fordwas so impressed with Mickey Rooney’s performance in the film that he arrangedfor Rooney to meet with Edison’s widow. Ford’s friendship with Rooney continuedwell into the next decade, as did Edsel Ford’s friendship with Mickey Rooney. Infact, Ford made sure that the very first Edsel that rolled out off the assemblyline was deli­vered to Mickey Rooney, who bragged about it well into hiseighties.It took just two generations for the Edisons to become one of the most powerfulfamilies in America. And it took three generations for an Edison to rise topolitical power. This is how America works. But besides the financial story ofthe Edisons and their rise to prominence, it is the intellectual story of ThomasEdison that is so intriguing. He was more than just the right person at theright time. He actually invented the future.How the Evolution of Edison’s Inventions Worked: The Electric PencilIt is fascinating to track the evolution of Edison’s ideas into pro­ductsbecause it demonstrates his abilities to see beyond the immediate invention toindustry that would result. One of the best examples of this is Edison’sinvention of the electric pencil, which led to the invention of the mimeographmachine, a device with which an operator would mark a letter or image on astencil, which would then imprint on a piece of paper. This created theduplicating industry and brought the power of print, which in the 1870s was onlya power available to industry because of the expense of heavy printing presses,to smaller businesses and schools. In this, Edison was like the inventor ofmoveable type, a nineteenth-century Gutenberg, who brought graphic duplicationto the world. And how ironic it was that Edison’s first business was based uponhis acquisition of used moveable lead type for his Grand Trunk Railroadnewspaper when he was still a boy. The modern mimeograph machine, popular asrecently as the 1970s and then superseded by the photocopier, revolutionized thedissemination of information. Imagine a simple device for reproducing designsand text, improved over the decades, which lasted over one hundred years. Thiswas Edison’s vision.The R&D FactoryHis other vitally important vision was the idea that inventions could beimagined and brought to fruition within a laboratory setting, corralling thetalents of many different individuals with different skills. In this way, itwasn’t just the invention itself that came out of Edison’s Menlo Park factory,it was the creation of what today we call the research and development shop, afunction so critical to industry that R&D is a line item on corporate budgets.Research and development is the heart and soul of industries that need to stayahead of their competitors, that need to foresee the need for new products toprovide solutions for things consumer and business markets might not even knowexist, and that need to create value out of intellectual product.The Quest for FireOne of the seminal moments in the development of human civilization was theutilization of fire. It brought light to the night, brought humans together toshare the food they cooked, and provided warmth. Fire also brought about therapid development of structured vocal human language, and from structuredlanguage to concepts, ideation, and literacy. Though this may seem like astretch at first, the electric light and municipal power grid also extended thereach and growth of civilization. This wasn’t just the creation of a newindustry, public electric utilities; it enabled cities to grow, to electrifythemselves to bring more light than natural gas provided, and to electrify masstransportation. Thus, the advancement of human civilization in the twentiethcentury can be attributed to Edison’s experiments with electricity in the latenineteenth century. The invention of the light bulb, and thence the Edison tube,became the basis for communication via electrical circuitry, particularlytelevision. There is also the socioeconomic legacy of Thomas Edison. Perhaps hisbiggest legacy was the consumerization of a market previously only open to therich, appliances and convenience appliances could be produced for the massesinstead of only for the upper classes. He brought about a greater egalitariandistribution of goods, which, in turn, brought about a greater spread ofopportunities for advancement and growth for the working classes. In so doing,he transformed America in the twentieth century.The Creation of the Science of InventionIt can be said that the science of invention, if not the practice of scienceitself, is a form of intellectual reverse engineering. Scientists begin with atheory of something—say the theory that the lightning we see striking the earthis a form of electricity. Then, scientists, like Benjamin Franklin, useexperimentation—say a lightning rod attached to a high-flying kite—and thedesign of what constitutes proof to certify that theory is either correct orincorrect. But in either instance, it starts with a theory, sometimes only basedupon a hunch.This reverse engineering of thought to practice to proof also best describes howEdison worked and why his work was so consumer oriented. It also explains theprocess by which he formulated his ideas for the spirit phone. Because he livedand worked in the age of Einstein and Planck and was a consumer of intellectualthought during the age of Freud and Jung, he was able to develop his theory oflife units. But, he advanced the thought by supposing that if electronicparticles had qualities that allowed for attraction, perhaps these life unitsalso possessed the physical attribute of attraction. And, even half predictingthe theory of quantum entanglement and spooky attraction, Edison theorized thatthese life units were able to corral themselves into specific cohesive masses.Then, inasmuch as life units formed the basis for how human bodies navigated andrejuvenated themselves, he supposed, they not only pre-existed the body, butwere the building blocks of life. And here he was advancing his own conceptsthat would become the theory of the genome and the work of DNA and RNA. Butwhere he took it, no one had gone before. His thought process ultimately mergedspiritualism and religion. Edison believed that we don’t really die, and thatthis could be assayed scientifically. And that, as stressed throughout thisbook, was why the spirit phone would work.We may take Edison’s life and work for granted today, now that we’re in thedigital age in which human beings and machines are actually merging to evolveinto a new lifeform, the cybernetic orga­nism with paralyzed limbs directed bycomputer and brain implants to merge thought, volition, and machine, but it wasthe process of Edison’s thought that brought us to this point. It’s not just theinventions, but the intellectual process itself behind the inventions thatbrought them into existence. That is Edison’s greatest legacy.The mere possibility that science could prove that the unseen could be perceivedas the driving force behind Edison’s vision of the importance of electricity andthe measurement thereof. It is, therefore, a more than fitting tribute that oversixty years after the death of Albert Einstein, the scientist who probablyinfluenced Edison the most, one of the major aspects of his theory of Gene­ralRelativity was borne out. This occurred in 2016, when a gravitational wave everso slightly altering the space/time of planet Earth reached the LaserInterferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, our intergalactic version of anineteenth-century tromometer, after its 1.3-billion-mile journey acrosscreation, where it was duly registered. Of course, this gravitational wave didnot prove that Edison, or Tesla for that matter, could talk to the dead. But itdid show that both Edison and Tesla were correct in their respective theoreticalpursuits of a device that could measure what had only been dreamed of for scoresof thousands of years: a device to ping the unknown.Edison was devoted to the process of taking research into theory, thendeveloping inventions based on the proof of that theory and tailoring them to aconsumer market that could exist. In the final decade of his life, there was aninsight into a market that not only existed at the time, but had existed sincethe beginning of civilization. This was a market that asked, and soughtexplanations for, the basic questions concerning what is life and what happenswhen life is over. Imagine a person who had invented the very things thatelectrified and mechanized an entire civilization, now in the final decade ofhis life, going back to the beginning of human existence at the mouths of cavesto answer the primal questions that remained for the hundred millennia of humandevelopment. Was that because Edison knew that he would be staring into the faceof death and believed that the only way to understand it was through science? Ormaybe it was because the person who lit up the darkness of the urban night nowwanted to light up the last realm of darkness that existed: the darkness ofdeath. If science could create cities of light, why couldn’t science light updeath itself?This was how the process of Edison’s thought led him to the creation of thespirit phone. At the very last, when he awoke from his coma in 1931, he wasfinally able to answer the question that he had been working for ten years: thespirit lives on and we don’t die."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHORSJoel Martin is a national bestselling author, a former Long Island, New York,radio and television host who won a Cable ACE Award, and a nationally recognizedexpert on the paranormal.
